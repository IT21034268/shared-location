2,"Good toy, if you don't mind horribly off-key music","Our son received this toy for his first birthday. It has a lot of good features--teaches colors, numbers, farm animals and their sounds, several songs. But the music is AWFUL--the singer is off-key on every single song (either that, or they did a bad job of matching up the music to his voice). As someone who appreciates music, I cannot tolerate listening to this, especially since there are far better toys out there. Since our son already has 2 LeapFrog toys which teach the same concepts as this toy (the Learning Table, which has much better quality music, and the Fridge Farm), we will be exchanging the Vtech Discovery Nursery Farm for a different toy."
2,Hand catcher,We had this toy for less that one year and both of our boys got their hands stuck in the piggy door. Thanks to a good company like V Tech they replaced the toy. I would definitly tell anyone considering this toy to move on.....
1,Great for tone deaf people!!,My husband and I bought this at a garage sale for $3 from a friend. I'd be furious if I had bought this in a store. We are both musicians and it kills our ears everytime that man sings on there. My child loves playing with it but it will probably be tossed out the door for everyone's sanity.
4,"Decent toy, but kind of spastic","Maybe it is because my five month old is playing with it and it is rated for 9 months+, but this toy seems to enforce a short attention span. Everytime she touches a button the toy completes switches gears. I have never heard a complete song, just ""Old Mac . . .Red, red like the . . .Let's play and learn with . . . Mary had a . . ."" You get the point. BUT, she does seem to like it quite a bit. We've not had a finger get stuck yet. We bought ours at a thrift store, so it was definitely worth the $4 I paid for it."
2,"ANNOYING AND UNSAFE, IN MY OPINION","My 11 and 23 month old kept getting thier fingers stuck under the swinging pig door. The space is large enough to fit a small finger under and it's not easy to get out! I let it slide the first time it happened to my 11 month old, but when it happened to my 23 month old and continued happening, I put it away. Each of them would panic and scream bloody murder because they couldn't remove their fingers! How much fun is that?? Also, the person who sings is REALLY annoying and off key. Not a very good design."
5,Our best toy so far,"We got this toy when our baby was 4 month old. Very entertaining and good value for the price. The baby is almost nine now, and this toy is still her favorite, as well as mine. All the bad reviews got me concerned; I won't take it away, rather keep an eye on my baby's playing with it. However, I won't buy it for my friend's baby as I previously thought."
4,Loved the book because it's true!,"Having been an intern for 4 years for a Division 1 University football team, I can honestly say that this novel could not be more true. I adored the coaches I worked for, admired them for their accomplishments, their passion for the team, and for the ""majic"" they brought to our University town. I loved the players too. I screamed my heart out for them every Saturday and knew many of them like I know my own brother. But I can't tell you how many times I lied to a coaches wife, did a players homework, and wore a skirt while a ""hot"" recruit was visiting, because I was told to. I think I know all of the people Nanci Kincaid was talking about. In a country of sports, sports, and more sports, Nanci Kincaid opens up a point of view that we don't usually hear-a womans!"
2,Doesn't keep the charge.,"I bought this battery for my Nikon camera. I charged the battery fully overnight. When I went back to use it the next week all the charge was gone. I had to charge it again. It does work with the camera, but you have to keep it in the charger all the time. Not exactly a replacement for the original part."
4,Why Pay More?,"This battery is at least as good as Canon's own, and costs a lot less. What else do you need to know?"
1,Not a High Performer,"I was hoping this would be a decent alternative to the Canon battery. I charged it, shot 20 pics with it, let the camera sit for a week, and the battery was dead. After this experience, I am pretty certain paying the full amount for a Canon battery is the way to go."
5,6 months,"Had it for 6 months now. It is as good as the original one.Charges in the same time and has almost the same number of shots.It will probably last less, but for the money it is definitely a great deal."
5,Stock up on these batteries for cold weather use,"I was concerned about these cheap batteries not performing well enough. Well, I was wrong. I bought 2 of them (just in case 1 is DOA), charged them up, and took them up to climb Kilimanjaro. I thought they would drain fast in the cold weather. I was proven wrong. 1 battery lasted me for the whole 7 days of climb, with temperature between +35C to -10C. It also lasted through my Zanzibar trip, and finally drained out on the 2nd day of my safari. In total, one fully charged battery took over 1,000 pictures with my Canon 40D, through some really cold weather.I think that the sellers charging shipping for each battery is a rip-off (even though they are shipped in one envelope), and I don't agree with that. But, given these batteries are so cheap even with the shipping, I would still buy these next time."
3,A decent historical overview,"Thomas's book is a good overview of the evolution of the Washington press corps and its relationships with various presidents since the 50s. Anyone who wants to gain insight on the current press corps' lapdog relationship with the Bush administration would do well to read this book.And, contrary to what John R. Linnel would have you believe, the book is not a hysterical diatribe against the Bush administration. While Thomas is critical of Bush in places, she is an equal opportunity curmudgeon, lashing out mainly at what she sees as the dangerous abdication of the press of its central role as watchdog in a democratic society.The book drags in places, but it's nice to have the voice of long experience to help give shape to one's view of an important democratic institution."
5,Love it,My 1 and 3 year old have been playing with it a lot. They are a little young right now to get the fraction part of it but they love to make and serve us a pizza for now.
4,Love these Luceros!!!,"Love these heels, I tell ya! These pumps have this unique sexy style that accentuates leg length creating some seriously, gorgeous knock-you-out pair of legs. I love 'em so much I got 2 pairs in black. It is a timeless, classically erotic bang that impressed me the first time I ever laid eyes on these babies. Worth every penny!"
4,IG Rocks,"This is a great one from the Indigo Girls. It takes some time to get used to the first track ""GO"" but once you do you'll love it. The music is slightly different from all their others but it is awesome!"
4,Fabulous new release by the girls,"Go, Soon To Be Nothing, Gone Again and Peace tonight are fabulous!Rush to get this. One of the year's best albums!!!!"
2,Is this really them?,Many of us who love the Indigo Girls for their amazing soaring harmonies and wonderful acoustic guitar work will be severely disappointed. I hope this is not the direction in which they will continue.
1,How embarassing!,"These fellows need a proof-reader! Showing their lack of understanding of the English language in bold print on the cover makes me embarassed for them. ""Effect"" is a noun meaning a result or consequence. They should have used the transitive verb ""Affect."" Shame!"
5,Kang of Da Funk ain't nobody touched Rick on the funk since,"Rick James was the truth Musically and his Musical Funk Stew ain't been touched since. he wrote and Produced Great material on himself, Mary Jane Girls, Teena Marie and Eddie Murphy. give a shout out to the Stone City Band as well. and Val Young. Rick James was the Blueprint at making the Funk work at all radio and yet keeping it with strut and Swing. you always knew a Rick James Cut, all the trademarks were in place. this is a tight collection and showcases his many talents as a songwriter, instrumentalist, Producer, arranger and a ear for melody."
4,GO AHEAD SON ! TELL EM WHY U MADD !,"Deric "" D-Dot"" Angelettie has an impressed track record you want to check his creditials as a writer, producer for Bad Boy writting for acts like Faith Evans, 112, Total, the Late & Great Notorious B.I.G, also workin with other acts like SWV, Da Brat, Goodie Mob.. Now it's his turn to shine .. He comes with his debut effort Tell Em Why U MADD! On the 24 track disc .. D-Dot split time flowing in his natural speaking voice and his Alter Ego voice The Madd Rapper.. Some of the brightest moments on this album comes when alter ego Madd Rapper takes over the track like on the off the meter Stir Crazy (featuring Eminem) this song is off tha hook .. You all have to check this out.. The underground hit from last year How To Rob w/ 50 Cent are among some of the brightest moments.. other noteworthy songs You're All Alonew/ Picasso Black, Ghetto w/ Raekwon & Carl Thomas, They Just Dont Know w/ Black Rob& Nature.. Check this out dont sleep on it.."
1,Wide Sargasso Sea is a diabolically flawed feminist rag,"Feminism in WSS is not only destructive, but is the only thing which seems to accentuate the chronic weaknesses already established in the book more than Rhys' own cynical mumblings. Frankly, a book which is disgraceful in comparison to any other that I have read. Try Crime and Punishment instead."
2,Another Chore,"Generally when I pick up a novel I expect to get something out of it. Having to read this for my English class I found it to be a chore. Rhys expanded on a character who was ment to be a mystery. Although it did have it's moments (the uprising of the slaves) it lacked in the delopement of Rochester of Antionette (Bertha). I cannot say it was not teh worst piece of litureture I have read for nothing compare with Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but I did feel left a little empty as to why some of things happened the way they did. I would recoomend this novel to anyone who as enough time to comprehend the true nature of it."
3,"Decent Story, but Annoying Format","I agree with other reviewers--the changing of perspectives between the three sections is jarring and confusing. It definitely makes the book hard to follow, and wears on one's patience. Also, I found the ""Jane Eyre""-retelling concept a big gimmicky, although I must admit that the ""gimmick"" worked more effectively than I had expected.That being said, the central drama in this novel makes a good, solid yarn. What I liked best, however, was Rhys' competent depiction of a time and place that I am wholey unfamiliar with. The setting of ""Wide Sargasso Sea"" was certainly new, fresh, and exotic to me. If you like to really explore the world from your armchair, this is a good book for you."
2,Meh.,"Meh. Just meh. It's not a terrible book, but really, there are such better things you can do with your time - like watch TV, or read just about anything else."
5,GREAT CONDITION!,"This book was actually worth the money no scratches, no dents, or anything of that sort"
3,"Atmospheric, moody","I have enjoyed reading the wide spectrum of reviews on this novel; its obviously a love it or hate it type of proposition.Say what you will about whether it stands alone, needs Jane Eyre as background or insults Bronte, it is a beautiful work of prose. Jean Rhys describes locations and places and moods with skill that I'm sure all the Bronte's would greatly admire. And hey, you have to consider that between Bronte and Rhys lies an entire century of change in attitudes and styles.I'd recommend it as a suitable post Jane Eyre reading for those that loved Jane Eyre."
1,Some things aren't meant to be known,"This book was a horrible piece of literature that I was forced to read for my school. It completely wrecks the book of Jane Eyre. Some things are not meant to be known. The mysterious of Bertha (Antoinette), added to the quality of Jane Eyre. Wide Sargasso Sea did nothing to add to Jane Eyre but rather take away from it. Rochester believed to be a great man at the end if Jane Eyre. After reading Wide Sargasso Sea, this is not the case. Maybe Charolette Bronte did not want the reader to believe this, but Jean Rhys comes in and just about recreates one's beliefs about Jane Eyre. I would reccomend that this book should not be read. Rather, it should be burned."
1,This book was more tedious and painful than chewing glass!!,"Due to the sadistic nature of the Board Of Education we were forced to read this book for 3 unit English. After studying Jane Eyre we were thankful for the shorter book, after reading it however there must be something said of someone who must stoop to stealing a classics characters and mutilating them reducing them to self centred, psychologically impaired,suicidal beings. If it were possible I would have given negative stars for the time I wasted from my life forced to read this book. Im hoping that in the afterlife Charlotte Bronte is teaching Jean Rhys a lesson about plaguarism by stabbing her repeatedly from the inside out while quoting Jane Eyre."
3,Original not required reading as long as you know the plot,"Jane Eyre or not it was one hell of a crazy good story. The way you fell into madness with her was believable like yellow wallpaper. This book took me happily through a 10 hour bus trip which broke down, lost electricity and had no AC.The personalities are so persuasive you can loose yourself in her trippy world of social cliffs and voodoo love."
2,far out,"I bought this book upon recommendation of a friend, but I didn't have enough background knowledge of Barbados to understand the bias and bigotry that the characters were involved in. Interesting style of writing, though, and a clever premise."
4,One for Margaret,"My Aunt, who is now 86, read this book in England, when she was much younger. She mentioned it to me, as I use the Web, and I purchased it for her. She has told me that she very much enjoyed reading it again. She also said she had watched a BBC TV series on the same book, but I can't find it for her. Can you?Yours sincerely,Peter E Bradley"
2,Bennett In Too Deep,"I purchased this album with great anticipation. I was familiar with, and enthusiastic about, what I think of as Tony Bennett's signature Ellington Piece --""Take The A Train""--and thought that this might be a multi-track dose of the same. Instead, I found Mr. Bennett in not-too-good voice, swimming not-too-effectively through arrangements that I found to be soupy and predictable. A couple sounded more like Basie --much more appropriate for Mr. Bennett's limited range--than Ellington. The album picks after the eighth track as Mr. Bennett settles into several saloon tunes that he does so well but the hope of a big payoff fizzles as a swinging version of ""It Don't Mean A Thing"" is almost totally handed over to a drum solo which, while impressive, is hardly the reason I purchased the album. I also found it cloying and disrespectful of the listerner that snippets of ""A Train"" were scattered throughout the CD and the full version was never delivered."
3,as he states I have enough albums to make my own top 10.,"Top songs are ""Ova herre"" wich is a vivid diss directed towards Nelly.""Splash"" has a great beat and of course he shows up lyrically.""Down the Charts"" he shows some of his best storytelling on how Nelly keeps on Falling.""Message 2002""He does a remake of the message on ""Stop it"" he shows a good Raggaestyle that he is known for.""problemz"" has a good beat and he does it great.He just tears Nelly to shreads on this.Lyrics-10/10 Production-6/10 X Factor-5/10 Classic-7/10 Replay-7Total=7 out of 10 Fingers"
1,Awful,"I am a country fan, but baffled at how this man ever became a superstar. It's the beer slugging drinking songs he markets is all I can figure, certainly not his voice of a 3 note range. This CD (actually selling as 2 CDS if not the MP3) is boring, uninspired and unless you are a not entirely sober redneck, probably not worth your time or money. He ruins classics such as White Christmas, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, and I'll Be Home For Christmas. There is not an ounce of emotion or conviction in any of these recordings, simply awful. If he is not singing about drinking or pick-up trucks he is lost!!! There are outstanding Christmas collections by country artists like Faith Hill and Martina McBride, get those, stay far, far away from this mess!"
2,This will not do.,"I read only the first 100 pages before abandoning this. Ackroyd writes in an irritating punchy style with many 1-word sentences to show emphasis. This aggressive style was offensive, and at time condescending. It also was distracting. The story is supposed to be about Dickens, after all. The author is prolix, self-indulgent and more interested in establishing his own originality than that of Dickens. Less rhetoric and a steadier narrative are called for, with much less high-flown speculations. Can anyone recommend a good biography of Dickens?"
2,Not at all what I expected,"I am very surprised that these patterns are so difficult to follow. I ignored all the reviews thinking I wouldn't have any problems and I was so wrong. Measurements are misprinted in some places, other places measurements are totally off. Plus the way she makes the patterns takes twice as long or longer to create. These are simple little pieces but I had more trouble doing them than a collector dress from Paradise Publication (which have very enarmorate and fancy outfits).After many unsuccessful starts and restarts I sat down and rewrote all the patterns (except a few like the bikinis or blankets). I can create a whole ensemble in less than two hours now since I did that.I am glad she wrote the book because using her pattern as a basic guideline and looking at the pics, I am able to create some cute pieces to go with the wedding dresses and other collector ensembles I create."
1,Very Exasperating,"Right off let me say reading your reviews are all misleading. When I read the book I didn""t get the same reaction to the charters. The Hero was the most unlife like hero you""d ever want to meet. Please tell me where was the romance in this misarable excuse for a love story? The herione pined through the whole facade and our hero kept fighting his feelings for her {of course he never tells her of his feelings} then when the sister he came to save , who ignores and hates him, smiles at him finally what does this jock do? Why he""s so thrilled he is quite pleased with himself. We get around to him declaring himself about the last what maybe seven pages. If I was the herione I would tell him to get lost and find myself a True Hero. Sorry not a love story just a lot of depressed feelings and little joy that comes when you are in love."
3,Happy with purchase...,"The CD is ok....the music is a bit outdated, sounds like something from the 80's, but overall it's ok. My little one sings the songs in the car. The one thing I was disappointed in was the book...it has the musical notes for playing the songs, I was under the impression it was a picture book in Spanish. It's an allright combo for the price."
2,ok show,"love john Wayne, but some of these earlier ones not so much.but im big fan as he gets olderin his films."
2,"Bad Quality, could have been wonderful.","I have the book that goes with this DVD. This could have been wonderful, but the quality was very grainy and that ruined it for me."
4,I can't get enough of Reveal!,"I haven't been this excited about an album in along time. I've been playing this daily and even my wife and kids are digging it. The band has crafted melodies that lift the heart and move me deeply. I was dancing with the kids to the first 4 songs last night and if you close you eyes during ""She Just Want's to Be"" I promise you'll get carried away too! Thanks for the cool ride."
1,Way Past Dull,"Don't touch this one. REM seems to think that adding gimmicky over-dubs and sound effects will help these dreadful songs. The result is boring, repetitive noise. There are other bands out there making music far superior to anything on Reveal. Save your money and try ""Satllite Rides"" by The Old 97s or try one of Wilco's later CDs."
2,"Two stars for ""Imitation of Life""","One good song and 11 filler tunes. Too bad there's no zero star rating.How did this get released? Boys, I'm disappointed in you.My brother, who introduced me to the boys from Athens back in 1983, says, ""The songwriter left the band."" Never was this clearer than here."
3,with all due respect this is pretty dull stuff,"Time has finally caught up with R.E.M. After mostly dodging predictability for twenty years the band seems to be out of gas. The singer/lyricist struggles to create melodies and memorable phrases (or coherent songs for that matter). The lyrics are dry impressionistic things and Stipe attempts to rescue the non-melodies with melismatic flourishes. To my ears it's all stylin' without much substance.I thought New Sounds in Hi-Fi showed that the songwriting was finally running down some predictable ruts but the ""Up"" record was a nice comeback. This record sounds like ""Up"" the sequel without the melodic and lyrical content (""Up"" may be Stipe's best set of lyrics). There's no lack of effort on ""Reveal"" but there's a real lack of variety. Almost every song is mid-tempo or slower with familiar R.E.M. harmonies. So Stipe is really on the hook to entertain and he just doesn't have the ideas on this record. C'mon back, Bill Berry!"
2,Lame Effort,"I have all the R.E.M. CD's, and of all of them this one has the least redeeming qualities. All the songs sound the same! There is not one that has any rhythm or beat to get you into the music. All there is is a bunch of quiet, laid back songs, that contrary to the recent review in Newsweek, does not get better with time. (having listened over and over, hoping I liked it more, but no such luck) Oh well, these guys are a great band and heres hoping their next effort is stronger."
2,How I Long For The Old Days,"I wore off the grooves (figuratively, for you older folks) off the recordings of ""Murmur,"" ""Reckoning,"" ""Fables,"" and everything up to ""Monster,"" but I'll probably never listed to 'Reveal"" again. Why I ran out and bought it and expected anything different is beyond me, considering R.E.M.'s last four albums. Sure, it's great music to a lot of people, but I guess they just outgrew me. If you didn't like ""Up"" and ""New Adventures in Hi-Fi,"" don't bother with ""Reveal.""Vacation in Athens is calling ..."
2,Be honest--how often do you listen to this CD?,"I read all these glowing reviews, but I think I'm reading those of a different album. This band is frequently great, but these songs from ""Reveal"", show only another sad step towards boring obsolescence. I was excited by the ""return of REM to the fore,"" but this is, unfortuately, not it. Keep your cash."
3,Very disappointed,"I rushed out to buy this album because I loved the single Imitation of Life. Unfortunately, I found it to be the strongest track on the album. Most of the other songs are either lush and soft with little back bone, or meandering pieces with minimal impact.I had high expectations for this album, and am quite disappointed."
4,A sample of pure magic,"I heard the new REM album Reveal was a little bit slower then their earlier stuff like Monster, and Adventures In Hi-Fi and I listened to it and I had to agree but it captured me. this album is very beautuful and very classic. with songs like ""Imitation Of Life"" and ""The Lifting"" this album is still one of their bests and I love the sound and it really tells you how awesome REM is and always will be."
2,Enough already,"How bad have things gotten? Well, Stipe thinks there's a point in writing the millionth song about the phony lives Madison Avenue and Hollywood are trying to sell us. Thanks for the warning Mikey. And I don't know if there have been a million nods to Brian Wilson in the last few years but we don't need two more to add to the pile. The sad irony is that REM used to make music that was so good that people wanted to sound like them.I'm guessing that Reveal will be to REM what Pop was to U2 -- the failure that brings the realization that gimmicks won't do when you've reached the limits of your talent. Hopefully though, they won't take the coward's way out like U2 and start rehashing the schtick that made them rich. Be brave boys. Say goodbye."
1,"1. I'm Ready2. Yellow Kid3. The Banana Question5. Juicy, Jui","A DIFFERENT KIND OF REVIEWREM fans are ridiculous and sick people. REM is equally as ridiculous and sick. Quite frankly, they should be cleaning Pylon's houses and taking out their garbage right now. But since pop culture must always be boring, mediocre and REPULSIVE, that didn't and will never come bout. still, LONG LIVE NO WAVE/PUNK!ps. AthFest is a farce, so please people, save your parents' money for something far and away from Athens.Okay, Thanks!"
4,R.E.M. is back,"If you want to be happy play this cd! I am a huge R.E.M. fan (ever since chronic town), and I had to listen to Reveal a few times before I could get used to it. The first time I listened to the whole thing I wasn't very impressed, but now I love it. If you liked Out of Time, Reveal is very similiar sounding to it. This cd at least sounds like the old R.E.M. unlike Up. Immitation of Life is R.E.M.'s best song in 10 years. Hope this review helps you."
4,Innovative and Evolutionary,"It always makes me laugh when so-called ""veteran"" R.E.M. fans pine for the olden days of ""Pagaent"" or ""Fables"". It's time to either move forward with this band or get off at the next stop. In case you hadn't noticed, R.E.M. is a band that is constantly evolving and trying new things from album to album. That's why they are so good, and that's why ""Reveal"" is so enthralling. It continues where ""UP"" left off."
2,pretentious!,"as a long time REM fan (since 1983 in fact); i have to admit this is their lamest attempt at an album. as one reviewer stated, there was a time when alot of bands tried to sound like REM. now THEY are trying to sound like the beach boys/brian wilson. ""summer turns to high"" sounds like michael stipe singing on an ENYA backing track (ugh!) any buyers out there for a used copy?"
2,The Worst REM Album Ever,"Sorry all you supporters of this mediocre effort .... have been an REM fan since Murmur and this is the worst they've ever done. I've never found myself skipping this many songs to dull the pain since the Chili Peppers' ""One Hot Minute"" (Saturn Return acutally made me sick to my stomach). No offense to the band, we all make mistakes - this is your first and I'm glad to see you're human. But all this, ""better than all of the 90's"" has got to stop. Those of you who are with me know who you are - 90's-wise ""Up"" blew this album away, and ""New Adventures in Hi-Fi"" (extremely under-rated) is a close second. Let's stop being nice because we idolize this great band, people. REM, gladly see you next time around."
1,A HUGE disappointment,Being quite a fan of REM I was so disappointed to hear the album after all the solid reviews it received. I have yet to read a review of this album that was anything but positive. The tracks on 'Reveal' are completely lacking in drive and direction and are missing the strong melodies REM songs are known for. The album has four OK tracks at most. I've tried to listening to the album again and again but my opinion has not changed.
2,I wanted to like it...,"I've been an R.E.M. fan for many years, and although I'm partial to the earlier stuff, I've also really enjoyed some of the more recent material. But I simply don't like Reveal. It doesn't grab me like their other albums have. I get the feeling that they're just going through the motions, grinding out another multiplatinum bestseller. Yawn. Where's the passion? It may grow on me--I've only listened to it half a dozen times--but in my experience, the best albums *don't* have to grow on me: they appeal immediately, suck me in, and demand repeated listenings. Not ""Reveal"", sadly."
2,A little past their bedtime,"R.E.M.'s latest nearly produces an effect that matches their name - inducing sleep. There are some moments of sparkle and musical warmth, but most of the release feels cold, distance, almost trite - even by R.E.M. standards. Even the best numbers sound recycled: ""Imitation of Life"" sounds like an admixture of ""Drive 8"" and a couple of cuts off of ""Fables"". ""Beachball"" will remind you of the Beach Boys ""Sunflower"" period and it's one of the strongest contenders here (it must be the jingle bells). This new CD barely impresses even after several listens and will be remembered as one of their weakest releases. Oh for the days of ""Radio Free Europe""! Recommended only for die-hard fans and completists. Suggestion to the band: get a new drummer and stop relying on scores of studio musicians."
4,UN'EPOCA CHE NON C'E' PIU',"Does Hard 'n heavy is a forgotten genre ? This CD is the answer, with an incredible Mr Moore. If you want remember '80, listens and close your eyes..."
4,Rapid Fire Answers to Big Questions,"This book is based on 15 magazine articles the author wrote in Prabuddha Bharata, Vedanta Kesari and Vedanta for East and West. One will likely browse the 19 chapter headings with summaries to choose a topic. Vedanta or Hinduism is explained with a minimum of Sanskrit technical language. Some of the chapter headings are about religious symbols, obstacles to religious life, super consciousness, types of salvation, self effort and divine grace.Other world religions are quoted to support the harmony of religions theme. The writing is to the point and the roughly 20 small pages per chapter, is an easy read. The bibliography is dated from the 1920's to 1950's, with glossary, an index to parables and a general index. The binding in my copy is coming apart.Swami Yatiswarananda (1889- 1966) was a monk of the Ramakrishna Math and served in Europe (where he founded an ashram in Switzerland) in America and India. He became the Vice-President of the Order."
4,Casper does it again,"Ever since Starship Troopers, this hot guy still seems to manage a good movie here and there. This is fortunately one of those unexpected good movies. In an action/comedy, Mr Van Dien seems to adjust to his role as a drifter quite well, opposite his on-screen partner. He drops his pants again for the camera, reminiscent of Starship Troopers, so girls and guys can drool once again. But aside from the eye candy (including Casper in jeans a tight singlet throughout - costume department must have had fun), the script is also very funny and enjoyable, for a reasonably lower budget movie. At the end of the day, Partners will not win any major academy awards, but is enjoyable movie around 85 mins."
4,Unable to use,"Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to use the product. I bought it for my cat, but he died before it came in. My cousin used it on her dog and she saw remarkable results."
2,little dissapointed,"if you're a risk fan you'll like this game, but i'm not sure how much better it is than the many free versions of the game available around the net. some cool features, but no online play, which is ridiculous with a game like this."
2,Not my favourite kind of music,"Good technique, but I didn't like it. Please listen the blues solos at the end of ""Eleven Blue Egyptians"". Perpetual burn isn't a real rock album.Jason Becker's style is ""strange"" and different from rock. So, if you want some rock, DON'T PURCHASE IT."
1,Disappointing,"The author, Mr. Newberg, seems to jump back and forth at times, as if unclear what the final point is he is hoping to make. His book seems at times a new age spiritual reflection yet ends up a soft science. This disappointing read is a re-hash of other prominent and earlier books in the field. The author seems to have jumped on the band wagon of ""cognition,"" yet adds nothing new to the study. The style of writing is chopping, and unfortunately, makes for a disappointing read."
3,Almost there but not quite,"I like the concept of this shoe. The leopard straps are a fun, sexy look. However the base fabric is manufactured to look like raffia or rattan. Again good concept but the quality is lacking making the shoe look cheaper than it should / could. On the positive side, it is very comfortable, the padding under the ball of the foot and rounded toe make this a very wearable shoe. Also, I wear either an 8 1/2 or a 9 in heels. With naughty Monkey shoes I always take an 8 1/2. Overall this shoe is almost what I want but I returned it. There are too many shoes out there to settle for almost."
3,Lacking Interest,I thought the relationships between Angel and the other characters got really boring after a while. The book itself was well written but not profound enough. I think you could get writing ideas from this book by just liking the literature rather than the actual content.
1,Cannot be worn because they don't screw in far and hang,"I wanted gold studs with a screw back so that I could wear them all the time without worry. They do have screw backs, but the screw apparatus does not have a back opening for the post to pass through, so the earrings cannot be made to snugly fit. Instead, they are balls on posts that stick out in front. I wanted the screw back, so I paid three times as much as similar earrings with a push back, but these do not look right. By the way, the backs in the photo are not what I received.I would love to contact the seller for different backs, however I don't see how I can do this, as this is not one of the ""available actions""."
5,Mom who tried them all,"My daughter is three months old and has severe colic. I started with Avent bottles which I thought were horrible. I then tried Playtex Vent Aire which we still use for nighttime feedings and are happy with those. After speaking to another mom whose baby had colic, she recommended Dr. Brown's bottles. I rushed to the store to get them. Although they certainly don't cure colic, they do help with excessive gas. The only cure for colic is time. My daughter goes back and forth between the wide neck and the standard bottles and has never had difficulty adjusting to the different nipple sizes. I still have her on the size 1 nipple even at three months because she is a fast eater and she has no problems getting the formula fast enough. I would highly recommend these bottles if you have a baby with feeding difficulties or colic."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!,"I STARTED MY BABY OUT ON THE PLATEX PREMIUM NURSER BOTTLES WITH THE INSERT LINERS THAT YOU CAN SQEEZE THE AIR OUT. SHE HAD A VERY MILD CASE OF THE COLIC AND WOULD BE A LITTLE FUSSY IN THE EVENING. I THOUGHT THAT GETTING THE DR BROWN BOTTLES WOULD HELP. THEY ARE ADVERTISED TO HELP WITH COLIC, BUT WHEN I FINALLY RECIEVED THEM NOT ONLY WERE THEY A PAIN TO CLEAN AND ASSEMBLE, BUT SHE WAS LESS FUSSY ON HER PLATEX BOTTLES. HER COLIC SYMPTOMS SEEM TO BE WORSE. I BEGAN TO USE THE PLATEX BOTTLES AGAIN AND SURE ENOUGH IT WAS BETTER. I WOULDN'T SUGGEST ANYONE TO BUY THEM...."
4,Dr. Brown's Bottles,"The bottles have many parts to clean, but they are worth it. The bottles have helped reduce my baby's gas and spitting up."
3,It leaks,"I have a 6 weeks old baby girl, and I saw many good reviews on these bottles. Let me tell ya, they leak like crazy. I mean if I tilted the bottle in a certain way, it works just fine, but if I was in a hurry or didn't really look at how I was feeding her, milk came streaming down from the bottle. At first I thought my daughter was leaking lol... ok bad joke lol.. I am now loving Avent bottles more and more"
5,This is wonderful,"I love this bottle. I am 6 weeks from my due date and already love them. While babysitting my colicy 1 month old nephew I tried these bottles on him to see is it would help. It worked like a charm he slept for 4 hours straight, and was a happy baby when he woke up. Well worth the extra money and work!"
3,Great bottle for baby with Acid Reflux!,"These bottles are great! My son had acid reflux and would never take more than 5 oz. from his Avent bottles. I tried these he took a whole 8 oz. and wasn't gassy. Cleaning takes a little more time, but it's worth it to have a happy baby."
2,Stick with the regular Dr. Brown's bottles instead...,"Do not buy these bottles! I tried the original, long and slender Dr. Brown bottles, and was so satisfied that I decided to purchase the wide-neck version as well; they seemed more trendy and convenient... more bulk/less height. First of all, they are not convenient at all as they are still very tall, almost as tall the regular shaped 8oz Dr. Brown's, and much more bulkier; making these far less convenient to take with you. Secondly the nipples in this version are different from the original size bottles; Their feeding effect... they are not as adaptable to an infant's mouth as the regular slender-neck Dr. Brown bottles. You will notice the difference in your child's feeding behavior; it will not be smooth feeding time like it is with the traditional shaped.I am 100% satisfied with the original Dr. Brown design, but I sincerely cannot recommend these. Take my advice and don't make the same mistake I did; stick with the slender version bottles."
3,Does have a downside though...,I think like many other reviewers that these are genuinely decent bottles but I was disappointed to discover that when I placed the bottle in my bottle warmer a substantial amount of my breastmilk evaporated during the warming. I tried to prevent the evaporation by pouring less water into the bottle warmer to heat the bottle up but nothing worked. I have put this bottle away for future use when I start giving my baby juice and water which won't require it being warmed up.
2,Warm-up booties,"I purchased the Herbal Concepts Comfort Booties after my previous pair ""sprung a leak"" on one of the booties and needed to be replaced. I based my purchase on a 4 star rating which was better than most of the other brands displayed. My first surprise came when i tried on the delivered pair. It seemed very tight, but I managed to put them on after warming them in the microwave for a little over 1 minute. I noticed that the seeds tended to bunch up in the middle under the arch of my foot and needed to be manipulated to warm the toes, where they were most needed. Although I am used to this procedure, I am not very satisfied with the ultimate result. I think the booties need several smaller compartments to distribute the warming seeds around primarily the the front part of the foot and not in the arch.Since returns involve authorization, repacking and mailing I am living with these booties and derive some (albeit not enough) benefit.Alfred Fischer"
1,"Great concept, POORLY made!",First of all the biggest strike against these is that they are constructed of polyester and despite the warning on the package that they should not be heated for longer than a minute or two the fabric will ultimately melt. The herbs and flax retain heat to the point of ultimately burning their way thru thru the cheap and highly flammable fabric.Mine developed a hole after one two minute heating.Had these been made of cotton or wool or a natural fiber this could be a decent product.
2,Disappointed,"While these booties do warm your feet, the heat pack inserts are a rough uncovered sack that comes directly in contact with your feet and are uncomfortable to me since my feet are very sensitive to texture. Also, the fit is loose with no way to tighten the cuffs around your ankle so it's awkward keeping them on. I'll probably end up getting something else."
1,This movie stinks,"I thought there was a potential of Evil Twins wreaking havoc on a community. But, the acting by these twin unknowns, is terrible at best. The Direction is weak, and the plot is thin. Add that with terrible acting, and you have tossed several bucks in the toilet, not to mention the 20 minutes or so to realize how bad this cheap-ola production really is. And, it doesn't get any better. I have bought hundreds of Horror and Sci-fi movies, so I believe my opinion is based on volume of movies watched. Save yourself the money, and select something better."
5,Uncle Phil Rocks,"Master Reso player, Phil Leadbetter, lends his talents to a wide variety of songs on this solo project, none of which disappoint."
4,Howe 2 !,"What can I say - Howe 2, the band that started a new genre in music. This style is yet to be coined which unfortunately ended to date when the band split up after recording only two studio albums from 1989-1991. A must listen to - for any Greg Howe fan !"
5,The Foothills Ring with the Sounds of Bluegrass,"I have listened to WPAQ and owner Ralph Epperson for many years and have always been thrilled to listen to that good ole bluegrass sound. Every Saturday Ralph plays tunes that you can tell have to be on an old LP dating back to the 30's and 40's. The foothills around Mt. Airy, North Carolina and Ararat, VA ring with the sounds of this CD and this compilation does true justice to the true sound of the area. The purest bluegrass sound is found in the waves of WPAQ, and this collection will not disappoint. If you like bluegrass in any of it's modern forms, you will love this album."
2,What Happened?,"A long time reader of Charlotte Vale Allen, I was excited to see a new book by her on the shelves. I couldn't wait to begin this title shoving away others which were waiting. By about page 60, I found myself sadly disppaointed. Yes, the book and its various plots had all of the elements long time readers of Allens are familair with but for some reason this time the book didn't appeal to me. While the premise isn't an entirely new one, there was nothing special about this title which made me want to continue reading it. As a matter of fact, in the face of some terrible problems which should make one care, I found Allens characters to be wooden and never felt as though I knew them or wanted to. And the medical portion of the book was a bit much for this type of book, I thought. All in all compared to one of my favorite books by Allen, Leftover Dreams, the end of this book was a welcome parting gift."
2,"Okay band, but....",These guys have a lot of potiential and a good stage show and this album shows that they will probably keep getting a bigger following....but these guys aren't all from boston and some ain't Irish either....thus by lying about such things they lose quite a bit of steet cred...tell the truth New Hampshire boyz!
2,Poor Manufacturing,"This wrap is very soft and takes heat very well in the microwave without the seed filling burning and smelling awful. I used this wrap heated 4 times with no problem, however the 5th time it came apart and seeds went everywhere. I have never had a wrap do that. It appears to just be glued together instead of sewn."
5,SUPER Herbal wrap,"I love this product! Great size, for the price. It not only wraps around the neck, but also the shoulders. Great service and shipping."
3,good product,This product does what it promises but has a major flaw.If you buy it be sure that you are willing to spend some time sewing a reenforcing seam all around the outside edge. The original seam brakes open and allows the little seeds to pour out.
1,the worst pyle of $%^&*(),"bought it to replace a unit I call ""rusty crusty"" the package included everything i needed , all the headaches weren't needed the first unit came used, buttons missing and no thumb drive ,removed the boats original radio and installed the second unit and didnt work at all , cheap junk , rusty crusty reinstalled and working fine . waste of time junk"
3,not the same as the old UK dr martens,"This pair of 20 holes was made in Singapore and did not have the trade mark yellow/black cloth tag that hangs out the back of the boot. If Dr. Marten is going to outsource, the should impliment quality control over this clasic style or make them again in the UK."
3,Decent product.,"I have trouble with razor burn especially in the bikini area, so I was very excited to try this product after reading the reviews. It does work well enough, although like other reviews said, it seems to just be conditioner. The problem I have is that it smells like Nag Champa incense, which I don't really like. I might try a different scent later, or the unscented version."
3,Anita and Me - a review,I thought 'Anita and Me' by Meera Syal was a funny yet quite sad story. I liked the comic way in which Meena always seemed to be able to get out of trouble but I was suprised at the amount of racism she faced throughout the story. It had lots of little twists during her childhood involving her bizarre friendship with Anita. I'm not a great reader but I found this book very enjoyable and I would definitely read it again.
3,ELIXIR,Great strings as far as sound goes but the coating starts wearing of after a couple of weeks of use.
4,"For me, this is a classic!","The Muppetse Christmas Carol is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. The personalities are great, and the song are fantastic. I actually used lyrics from one in my Christmas cards.I do have one COMPLAINT, however. In this particular DVD I purchased is missing a song ""When Love is Gone"" that I loved. So I have to watch my old VHS copy when I want to see that part. It's my understanding that most newer copies do not have this song in it, since it was not in the original theatre version."
5,A Classic Muppets,Wore out the VHS tape years ago. Looking forward to watching this at Christmas time this year. Michael Caine is wonderful as usual. The whole retelling of this story is done with a fresh take and wonderful Muppet humor!
2,when songs are gone,"Not happy at all that they removed the song, ""When Love is Gone."" That's one of the BEST songs in the movie and it makes no sense to remove it. Especially because ""When Love is Found"" is at the end as a reprise - but no one hears the original song, where the melody comes from! If Scrooge doesn't lose his love with a song, why find it with one?? Best to find this movie on VHS...clearly the better version."
1,Can't buy at 85,"My sincere apologies Disney Corporation, but I will not purchase nor will I give a positive review to this film without ""The Love Is Gone"" being included in the film. This film is a solid Four Stars, perhaps even Five Stars, in its entirety. Nevertheless, this will not do and should be, for Heaven's sake, ""re-released"" in its entirety."
1,Depressing,"I didn't like it, and neither did my 3 yr old grandson, it was just as gloomy as the original."
5,One Of The Best Christmas Movies,"This movie just seems to get better the more times it's viewed. There are so many subtle things that you don't necessarily get from one viewing; for instance, giving Jacob Marley a brother named Bob. I never caught that until this Christmas. Having both a widescreen and fullscreen version is great, because the song ""When Love Is Gone"" (from the fullscreen version) is an important dramatic scene and really lends more sympathy for old Scrooge's current state. This version follows the original story better than a lot of Christmas Carol re-tellings. The only qualm might be that children under the age of ten probably won't understand this movie unless they're already familiar with the story. There's probably not enough silliness and physical jokes to appeal to very young viewers."
5,"I Don't Remember Much, But What I Do Know Is That It's Always Going To Be One Of My Faves!","I first saw this movie when I was about 8 or 9 and I love the Muppets ever since The Muppets Take Manhattan and The Muppet Movie. But this one tops it all! I like Michael Caine's role as Scrooge, it sord of describes him as ""the ideal one"". But some parts creeped me out like The Ghost Of Christmas Past & some other parts I can't remember. Kermit is a great Bob Cratchit and Gonzo is so funny as Charles Dickens. The Muppets are always my favorite group of puppets. This movie is just so awesome. Even though I don't remember much of it cause I was just a little girl and now I'm 16. But anyhoo...if you like movies with humor, music and is based on a novel. This is the one!"
5,Fun ! For the kid in all of us!,No matter what your age Dicken's timeless classic is one the whole family will enjoy. I highly recommend it for anyone who is a child at heart. It will melt the heart of even an Ebenezar Scrooge!
4,"Hey! Light the lamp, not the rat!","This chestnut is re-told with a sarcastic and skewed attitude. So much the better. Caine is the redoubtable Scrooge and the Muppets do their wonderful thing, as usual. The scene not to be missed is when Beaker flips off Scrooge after turning them down for a charitable donation. Enjoy!"
5,Excellent as always,"This movie is probably the most true to the story as anything ever done. That is saying a lot when one considers how many copies of this story is out there. The characters actually quote parts of the book. Of course the typical cynical muppets humor is there. Gonzo says, "" I knew that because I am the narrator. I am omni present"". That is just one example amon many they work in."
3,Kids somewhat interested,"I am basing this review off of my kids' reaction (boys - 11 & 9; girl - 4). My 9 year old liked it the most and my 11 year old enjoyed the humor. It didn't keep my 4-year old's attention and she liked the Muppet movie a lot. It's too bad, because this is one of my wife's favorites."
1,"STOP CUTTING OUT ""The Love is gone""!","I know someone at the studio thinks the song is slow and drags down the film but it is a pretty song and my VHS tape of it and my first DVD copy of it (in full screen format) has the song. WHY would they cut out such a scene from what is supposed to be a 20th aniversary version?!Save your money and buy an older copy, the version from a few years ago that has the option for wide screen or full screen format contains the missing song in it's full screen format."
3,A perfect movie -- so why does Disney treat it so poorly?,"This is my absolute favorite ""Christmas Carol"" adaptation. What makes the Muppets so great is their versitility --they can be used to tell any story, and this proves it. Kermit is Bob Crachit, Gonzo is Charles Dickens (a brilliant touch) and Academy Award-winner Michael Caine is Ebenezer Scrooge. The songs are as touching and as funny as any Muppet production in history, and Brian Henson is doing his father proud, helming these classic characters the way he has.The only beef I've got is with Disney's production of the DVD -- NO WIDESCREEN VERSION! Blast it, why are we still being subjected to fullscreen? TVs are going to be widescreen in a few years anyway -- the same people who whine about black bars at the top and bottom of their screen now will be whining about them on the SIDES then... The movie is nearly perfect. Five stars. The presentation is what yanks it down to three."
3,"Will buy it IF it's the original, uncut version","I'll definitely wait and see if they've restored ""When Love is Gone"" back into the full cut. If not, I'll just rip my VHS to a DVD. Can't believe that Disney would pull out the most beautiful song of the film, which also guts the emotion right out of a key point in the story. A moron move on someone's part, and, thanks to the earlier reviewer of the original 2005 DVD release blowing the whistle on this, I'm sure it cost them thousands of sales, rightly so. Disney - please fix this and stop reconstructing your own classics!"
5,This is a wonderful version of a heartwarming story,"You'd think that putting the muppets in such a classic tale wouldn't work, but this movie is wonderful. They have the right mix of telling the original story in a beautiful way and making it fun and lighthearted. The music is alway beautiful too."
2,Very disappointing.,"We love watching this movie during Christmastime so obviously I was excited about a new blu ray release. Aside from all the other complaints about this missing song (which I won't go into), the picture quality of the movie does not appear to be much different from the DVD release. It's very grainy and overall just so-so. Every bonus feature is the same from the previous DVD release so nothing new there. It's a waste of money in my opinion. If you have the DVD, don't bother!"
1,"Blu-ray is an edited, cut version","I stand with the other fans who refuse to pay for this edited, badly cut version of this great film. Disney, stop pushing these amazing films out just as silly fare for children and consider the adults who pay top dollar for them.(We want complete, unedited, beautiful transfers). You now own Jim Henson's Muppets, show his memory, and we fans some proper respect by making every new Blu-ray release the best that it can possibly be."
2,A Muppet Drama?,"Something is just not right when you mix ""muppets"" and ""drama"" together. The dark and dreary setting only enhances the unsettling mood of this movie. Neither my kids nor I have ever really enjoyed it, though we've tried with multiple viewings. We still prefer the first Muppet Movie much more."
4,"enjoyable, time after time--music sticks in your head","An adult who absolutely loves this version of the oft-told A Christmas Carol. Funny--you might not catch this, but Beaker flips off Scrooge (Michael Caine) when he will not give them a donation."
5,wonderful,It was just plain great. It has MUCH better graphics and the gameplay Was awsome. I highly recomend this game. I even play the game (and like it) more than my son
1,Don't Buy This Game!,"Parents: The whole game is fighting!Kids: After 1o min. I fell asleep! Boooooring! If you have played 1, you've played them all."
1,be carefull,Don't buy this if you own another Pokemon Game. They are just the same and I had a very disappointed 10 year old at his birthday party
1,Didn't work,I love the game but the cartridge I got does not work. The case is really scratched up and the connection almost looks like it was burned.
2,Pathetic attempt to recapture Glory,"Two buttweeds at school make fun of me on the bus, saying I like Pokemon, the fact is I don't! All sorts of kids back me up, but still. Pokemon was big and glorius for 5 years. Now they don't get it!!!!!! Pokemon's done! The games are no different from the others and have everyone buying all of the games to later get stuck. Children stay with this, other Japanese fans go to Goji."
4,pokemon silver,"I was waiting a long time for this game,i was a little disapointed at how easy it was compared to the other versons. My favorite new feature was mating 2 pokemon together (tip:ditto will mate with any pokemon so mate him with a rare pokemon like evee and get alot of that pokemon) my least favorite new feature is evolving some pokemon by tameness. I rated pokemon silver 4 out of five stars :-@."
5,Pokemon Silver is the best game ever!,"I am almost 11 years old. This is the best game I've ever played. It has lots of challenges and sometimes it is hard but out of all the games I've ever played it's more fun than the red, yellow or blue versions. This game has a hundred new Pokemon in it and you can really get addicted to it. I played this game for 14 hours in the last three days. This game has a whole bunch of new things like a radio, a phone, and all kinds of other tools. And the Pokemon learn a whole bunch of different attacks than from the other versions. So if you're going to get a game, get this one."
5,Poke'Mon Madness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Pokemon silver is a game with game with lots of new adventures that are very intrgruting.I am not very far in the game but I know it will be a game I will never ever forget.
4,Worth the cash,"Being an all time class, its at least worth a look. I remember playing this game as a kid. Much nostalgia was established by getting another copy of it."
5,It is what it says,So if this is what you want it is the real thing. but why do we have to be so wordy
2,Did you see the scene where he punched her across the room?!,"I found that damn funny. In fact, it was the high point of the whole movie. It was the only reason I gave it 2 stars! Tacky early 90's clothes (okay, I know they wen't so tacky then, but now...) Darian's funny, awkward friend, how she creeps around the woods in a nightgown...I had to force myself to stay awake through the whole thing."
3,MAYBE SHE NEEDED RITALIN?,"If it weren't for a couple shots of bare behinds (Elwes and Silverstone), THE CRUSH is almost like an Afternoon Special for Warped Kiddies. In her film debut, Alicia Silverstone pouts and pours on the sexual charm as 14 year old Adrian, a girl who finds herself with a ""crush"" on Cary Elwes, who plays Nick, an up and coming journalist who has his own ""crush"" on partner Jennifer Rubin. Of course, if you've seen FATAL ATTRACTION or SWIMFAN, you know where this one's heading. Elwes (Saw, Princess Bride, Hot Shots) wanders through his role like he's on Prozac, and the film has little real suspense. However, it's not an ""awful"" movie, it's just been done before and better."
3,Good ideas,Fun ideas. A little too labor intensive for me but I got ideas that I may use on my next cards.
3,book review,"it wasnt exactly what i wanted, but i didnt send it back because i hoped it would contain information that might be valuable later. it is a bit dated."
2,SLIPPERY WHEN WET!!!!,"I liked that this product is natural. If you are going to spend the day at the park, this one's great. Very lotiony application. But if you are going to go swimming, this one's a real hazard. It makes the skin so slippery when it's wet, I won't ever put it on my girls again for swimming. Very, very slippery."
4,"An easy match for King and Koontz, very entertaining","This book really holds your attention, a step ahead of Mr. Hills ""Dawn of The Vampire"" which in itself was an excellant work. Both books have a slightly differant slant to the vampire legend. I anxiously await his next release. Pick up both books, you'll hate to put them down."
1,"lasted 6 months, these are junk","I ordered 2 of these batteries- one from 2 different companies- the $15 variet, and a 95 cent one. When they arrived, they were the exact same product, so I should have gone with 2 of the 95 cent ones. The batteries began failing and not hold a change after 6 months, and now, at 8 months are totally dead. Previous to these battiers, my old batteries last 5 YEARS. I am very disappointed."
5,Holy Hotness Batman!,"Plenty of details about the book can be found on other reviews..so I'll go ahead and dive into a different sort of review! I've been reading romance novels since I was 13 years old and much to my dismay the genre has taken a downhill nose dive lately. I'm a huge fan of Feehan but I find that her newer books in the Dark Series lacked the excitement of previous installments! I was skeptical when I picked up my copy of A Hunger Like No Other but much to my utter delight I adored it! Run out and grab a copy you won't be disappointed! Ms. Cole does an amazing job with this book and I'm very eager for the next installment! If you feel bored with romance lately, you won't with this!!! Sizzling, Funny, and a perfect story is all found between the pages of this one! My keeper shelf hasn't seen a book in a while...this has an honorary place on that shelf now!"
3,stronger heroine,"I have read the first four in this series, and I would have to say that this heroine (Emma) was probably my least favorite so far. Emma is known as the ""timid one"" but I still think a little more courage or fire would have been nice. Especially with Lachlain as a mate - such a dominating, powerful hero. Overall, I loved Ms. Cole's quick witt and sarcasm through the novel. Emma's valkyrie family is hysterical and the characters for future books were set up nicely."
5,Hungry for MORE!!!!,"Don't walk...run as fast as you can to get this book!!! It is a must read and a must for your collection. I was honestly not expecting such a fabulous read. It was recommended to me at a local used book store. Just when I thought the paranormal world couldn't get any better, Cole jumps in with a whole new world of story and adventure and love. I laughed. I cried. I sighed. I sat on the edge of my seat totally aborbed in the tension and emotion. I felt the joy, pain, fear, and courage as my own. I fought to keep my droopy eyelids open because I couldn't put it down. And was left hungry for more and so glad I had bought the next 4 books!!!!!"
4,"Creative, a fast and exciting read!",I really enjoyed this love story come together between the two main characters. Interesting twist and turns thru the entire book. Would recommend it to anyone interested in paranormal romances!
5,thanks,"thank you so much, i really enjoyed the book.. so excited. wish my life was like that lol thanks anywas"
5,Nice beginning for the IAD series,"I could not put this book down, it is full of action and drama. I love that it has a happy ending, just like all books in the IAD series."
5,I have read this book 4 times.,"And I bought it 3 months ago. I love it. I love the characters, the plot, the conflicts, the world building, everything. I love Emma's growth as a heroine. I love Lachlain even more, lol.Yes, there are some objectionable aspects to the book. Yes, there are a lot of characters. Taken as a whole, however, everything worked for me. I went on to read the rest of the series, and I highly recommend this book as an introduction to the Immortals After Dark world."
5,Loved it!,"This is one of my favorite books of the whole series! I loved Lachlan. Kresley Cole should be on everyones autobuy list! If you haven't read this series, give it a try!"
1,Seriously?,"Why is this book getting such high ratings? The prologue is great, I wanted to read more. Unfortunately, the rest of the novel can't compete. I was trying to find a new series after JR Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood; should have saved my money. The writing is amateur. The author jumps perspective multiple times a scene making for a disorienting read. The characters are generic and unlikable. He's tall, dark and brooding. She's fair, delicate and naive. What characters aren't these days? But that is all there is to either one of them. Personalities? Not so much. And I'm still not entirely sure what the plot is. I would hate to see the rough draft. Save your money and time, read something else."
4,This is a very good series.,"This series was recommended to me and I'm so glad I decided to give it a shot. I read this book in 7 hours; while i was home sick, and I didn't want to put it down."
5,"Cher Sings ""A Different Kind Of Love Song""","For years people have been saying that Cher is on her way out of the music industry. This fantastic single proves them all wrong, showing Cher at her vocal best. The singing sensation proves that she still has what it takes to reach #2 on the Billboard Dance Charts.This single is a fantastic buy.**The ideal follow-up to ""Believe""**"
2,Mistitled and Annoying as A Loud Squawking Baby on a Plane,This is the most misleadingly titled cd of all time. I will speak truth: The love song is the same as all the others and this music would actually be better without Cher. Avoid this.
1,Just Terrible,"Completely inaccurate. If you are a true John Denver fan, you will hate this movie. You will get mad while watching this movie."
1,Don't buy it,"This movie is crap compared to ""Walk The Line"" about Johnny Cash (and I heard he had the opportunity to decide which actor plays him). The Songs they played and the situation John was in (in the Movie) didn't fit, especially the Scene where they played ""Flying for Me"" (which was written after Spaceshuttle Challenger crashed down and John almost flew in that Shuttle and in the last Minute they decided a teacher to fly instead).Kristin does a good Job though. But she can't make this a good Movie.Also the ""singing"" of Chad and the Music we hear isn't even synchrone.this hurts every John Denver Fan. My hope is that they bring out a new one some time soon and that that one is much better.To all John denver Fans: DON'T BUY IT! All others: you might not reading this anyway."
2,"Happy,... but...","I was happy when I give it to my sister for her camera. But disappointed when we found out it only accepts the 120Volts. She wasn't able to use it, she's in Philippines."
3,Great Product - but the switch panel stopped working,"The switch panel was not working after I tried it, 38 days after purchase. My mistake that I didn't test when I brought it. Kept using the remote control. Amazon refused to take it back after 30 days, so had to fall back on warranty. The product has now gone back to LG for repairs. LG support was pretty good though - so far."
5,The Very Best of the Andrews Sisters,"A great compilation of all their hits and many other songs you never knew about.This two CD ensemble captures the upbeat spirit of the World War Two era with the harmony of the Andrews with ""big band"" instrumentals and contributions from Bing Crosby."
5,Great follow up...,"This album unfolds with repeated listens. It's a great reflection on what the 80's had to offer musically recalling other fads and memorabilia(like ""members only"" jackets). The production alone is an interesting amalgam of new wave, early and late 80's r &b, old skool hip hop and hybrids. The album closer the Beauty of Machines even harkens Herbie Hancock's ""Rock It"" while 'Romeo is Bleeding' samples the late 70's early 80's ""Rude Movements"" with finesse. A horn-laden cover of the Nu Shooz jam ""I Can't Wait"" solidifies the 80's ethos. This LP serves as an interesting point of reference, showcasing how the 80's had a definitive sound and how all of those genres in the 80's drew from each other. Considering now there seems to be an 80's resurgence in sounds this album was ahead of the pack. I look forward to the final Sylk 130 installment."
4,The apex of mid 80's neoclassical guitar phenomenon,"Cacophony's ""Speed Metal Symphony"" contains some INTENSE lead guitarwork. The harmonized sweep arpeggios and speed picking runs are insane! The rhythm guitar,vocals and composition,however,are AWFUL. In addition- The album sounds like it was recorded on an 8-track tape machine in someone's garage! (""Speed Metal Symphony"" is a novelty of sorts in the neoclassical guitar world.)The lead guitar heroics on this album can't be denied. The song ""Speed Metal Symphony"" is jaw-dropping in terms of technique and overall dexterity. If you yearn to hear classic mid 80's-style shredding guitar TO THE EXTREME, then pick this album up...just don't expect to be impressed with the rhythm guitar,vocals,compositions and production.FINAL REPORT CARD-A (for lead guitar)F (for everthing else)*The album still gets a 4 star rating for its ""novelty!"""
5,Brilliant Finish,"A brilliant finish to an extraordinary trilogy. I've read various versions of the Arthur tales, including Mallory's, and this is the most satisfying and moving of all. Beautifully written without being sentimental, and because of its sense of reality, the most powerful rendition of the tales."
4,Live the legend in Derfel's eyes. A Great Book!,"A wonderful book! If you're looking for the story of King Arthur, this is it! Let Derfel, the narrator, bring you back in time visiting not only King Arthur, but the legend of Excalibur."
4,A long time ago,"A very good follow up to the two previous books in the series. It's a good fantasy fling into a historic time and place. Sharon Kay Penman STILL has everyone beat though as far as historical fiction is concerned. If you really would like to smell the battlefield, hear the clash of swords and the scream of of dying men and horses check out her books.The Sunne In Splendour: A Novel of Richard IIIWhen Christ and His Saints Slept: A NovelThe ReckoningTime and Chance"
5,Optical Mouse Pads,"Item obtained as one of a collectoin and variety of mouse pads for utilization in a traveling work environment, serves as an exceptional 'mini' optical mouse pad. Also excellent to keep that favorite photo under hand!"
1,NOTICE: this is CD 2 of 2!,"the first one is even better, u must find elsewhere! paste on google ""Outskirts (The Unofficial Lost Outkast Remixes) (CD 1)"""
1,The Devil's Curse Aka Credo,"There is one thing right that is mentioned at the start of the movie but at the same time what is mentioned also plays on people's fears(the point of a horror movie), This movie tries to play a Catholic angle then gets into a What's Going on/Whodunit?, It is boring and when the End comes there is a twist if it can be called that,the only thing correct is Yes Evil Exists but you should never play with it, at least the movie didn't have gore but it fails miserably as a snorefest."
1,TOTALLY BORING!,"5 FRIENDS WERE KICKED OUT OF THEIR COLLEGE ROOMS BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTYING.JOCK HAS A FRIEND WHO TOLD HIM WHERE THEY COULD HANG OUT TIL THEY GOT ON THEIR FEET.THEY ALL GO THERE.LATER ON,THEY HEAR VOICES AND WEIRD NOISES.SOMETIMES THEY FEEL A PRESENCE.JOCK COMES ACROSS ANOTHER PERSON WHO'S IN THAT BUILDING.LATER,ONE BY ON-PEOPLE START TO DIE.THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET OUT BUT THEY CAN'T FIND A WAY OUT.JASMINE GETS LOST IN THE CRAWLSPACE-WHAT A DOPE!ALICE IS AHEAD OF HER-AND SHE MAKES IT TO THE SPOT WHERE THEY WANT TO GO.THERE IS A SURPRISE ENDING,THOUGH.THE SURPRISE ENDING WAS THE BEST PART OF THE WHOLE MOVIE!"
4,Underrated film-noir with good actors and quite good story.,"I think this movie is quite underrated. It's not that bad. I have only seen one of Schlöndorff's other movies, The Ogre, which is very differnt from this one. The actors are good, especially Gina Gershon, Woody Harrelson, Elisabeth Shue and the fantastic Chlo Sevigny, and the story is quite good with some unexpected turns. The movie is, in some outdoor-scenes, also very beautiful, with the clouds, beach and sea at night. Harry (Harrelson) narrates the movie, like in many film-noirs, but the voice-overs are so few that when they come, it's a bit annoying."
3,It was okay,"It does have an interesting plot and story and okay characters kind of slow, but a good story."
3,"If you like Elizabeth Shue, Go for it!","This movie is O.K. I thought, not either of the actors best movie, Gina Gershon plays a good girl for once and is actually very believable, Elizabeth Shue, does a pretty good job ( I don't want to ruin it if you haven't watched it yet), and is very seductive. If your into mysteries and like watching them more than once even though you know *whodunnit* I recommend it. Otherwise, rent it first."
5,YALL NEED TO GET THIS CD!!!(10 stars),"...This CD is BY FAR the BEST CD I've heard in a while! To me, it beats out all the others because at last, we have a Christian CD that sounds OFF THE CHAIN and that is REAL. It doesn't have shallow lyrics or syrupy sweet hymns (nothing wrong with those but). It talks about real issues in the way Jesus does. I absolutely LOVE the way it talks about issues like racism and poverty, I was expecting a ""in our hearts we're united"" song and I was blown away by the honesty that is too often lacking in a lot of contemporary Christian music. The worship song is a BAGIN hiphop joint. I can't say enough good things about this CD! YALL BETTER GET IT! If you love Jesus but you've become disappointed with a lot of Christian music, this is the kind of music you've been waiting for!!!"
5,One of the best gospel rap cds you'll ever hear,"The Fault Is History by the Souljahz is a refreshing contrast to modern day gospel rap. While too many rappers rap about nothing and throw the words Lord, Jesus or God in at least one verse, Souljahz only focus is Christ. They tackle social issues like poverty, teenage pregnancy and racism with a christian view and offer much more than just great beats. Their music is without a doubt classic and you should go and get this cd as soon as poossible.You won't be disappointed."
2,not worth its money,i did not see the reviews but still was daring to buy this toy .when i received it i was only dissappointed.the blocks are very small for kids to see need a microscope to build the blocks.
1,I don't have Microsoft's money,"I too gave it a 1 for the ridiculous price. The disc producers aren't thinking about bootleggers. All a crook had to do is buy a set, then sell duplicates to get their money back. And it IS happening. I've seen them for sale. I can't say where, that's probably not ethical. But you see what I mean."
3,Only if you love Wayne Fontana....,"I bought this CD on the strength of ""24 Sycamore"" which I must say he does a brilliant job on, unfortunatly that cant be said for the rest of the tracks of which most can be said to be ""average"" ""Pamela Pamela"" was his biggest seller (I cant imagine why because it is an irritating song) after he left The Mindbenders and from what I read there was no love lost there. He was offered several songs which he turned down because he did nt like them and they ended up being monster hits for other artists like The Hollies. Not listening to his managment was his downfall because the songs he later chose just flopped and he faded away into obscurity....but if you like Wayne Fontana and he does have a good voice then maybe you will like anything he sings but I think this CD is for the diehard fans only"
3,My kids weren't impressed,Of all the toys they got for Christmas they were least impressed with this one.
5,Perfection or Vanity??? I'd say perfection..,"Where to begin with this cd.. If you're a fan of black metal, you probably don't like this and consider these guys sell outs.. I myself love death metal and always dismissed this band b/c they were ""black metal"", until I saw them live (w/ Nevermore, Children of Bodom, and Hypocrisy, awesome show BTW).. I was extremely impressed at the their brand of theatrical, impassioned music.. I see they have progressed and have left their black metal roots and for a more complex, almost death metal style.. When I first listened to this cd, I was in utter amazement.. Never had I been more impressed w/ an album upon the first listening.. And when the album closer ""perfection or vanity"" was done, I knew I was listening to a cd that was very special.. So rare is it to find an album so complete.. Absolutely no filler, every song, and I mean EVERY song is a highlight.. Categorize them any way you want, but if you love extreme music, you need this"
1,"whoa, hey now, this is total crap, ok?","some reviewer wrote: I wonder how many of the positive reviewers below, knows Norwegian?i wonder if you know how to speak proper english? anyways, dimmu borgir is crap. emperor light, and that's pretty tame.(emperor were good, but dimmu never will be.) avoid this at all costs, unless you're a fat, zit covered suburban kid who thought slipknot or lamb of god were the most br00tal band ever."
5,hehe Nicholas owns.,"When I learned that Nicholas would be doing the drums on this album I was very happy to say the least, for he is one of my favorite drummers. This album has great force, and as I started up track 7, I got goosebumps enough just from the drums. Everything else is awesome too...great atmosphere, great bm!"
2,Dummy burger ????,"This band is horrible...Can't stand them! How can any one into blackmetal enjoy such garbage ? Its mediocre and boring which this being blackmetal is truly a disgrace. As i said before, for good db get ""for all tid"" but do look past any other album made by dummy borgir or as i call them dummy burger...Ha!"
2,POOR,The special edition as it was advertised was missing the patch. I knew it was used but if there are missing items it should be post in that way you do not feel disappointed when getting an incomplete product. REALLY POOR
5,great blankie!,"I was so happy to find this little green monkey blankie for my daughter. She has claimed it & takes it many places. :) The size is perfect for packing it into a bag & taking it ""along"". The back & edges are satin, which was something important to my daughter. :)"
4,Cute for the crib!!,Bought this for our 8 month old granddaughter and she seems to like it. It works great for putting in the crib and keeping her occupied when she wakes up.
2,Disappointed with shipping charges,"The product itself met or exceeded expectations. The product was soft, silky and my baby likes it. The shipping on this $10, very lightweight item was $15. I have Amazon Prime, so didn't check prior to checkout on the shipping or I would not have purchased."
5,"well-made, solid mold makes for great candy","The plastic mold is one of the best-made candy molds I have used, especially when making frogs filled with chocolate truffle, peanut butter, and caramel. As with all candy molds, make sure to temper the chocolate first for best results."
4,Perfect for Harry Potter Parties!,"I purchased this for my daughter's Harry Potter party, and the frogs came out amazing! They were high in detail and were a hit. They are very hard to get out of the mold tray though, you have to be very careful and slowly push it out, or take a knife and go around the edges so that it loosens up and then push it out. They frequently came out a bit damaged from pushing it out, which is why I am giving this 4 stars. But if you are an expierienced chocolate maker, I would assume that you do just fine. (I have never molded chocolate before)"
1,Cheap plastic,"I must not have read thoroughly, but this image appeared to be metal, or at least a thick heavy plastic, but what i received was about as thin as paper. It was shoved in a small envelope and stuffed into my mailbox, leaving it bent and therefore not able to create evenly shaped frogs."
1,Oh dear...,"The only good thing about this book is the sense of wonder you get through thinking, 'how can Clarke have let this happen?' and how Gentry Lee, possibly the most inept writer working in fiction today is allowed to be released from 3rd grade Eng. Lit classes long enough to write this monstrosity.300 years is an astonishingly long time for nothing at all to happen. Nicole Des Jardins, sheesh, I half expected her to develop the powers of flight, and heat ray vision by the end of the book.This book is really quite dreadful. Read it as an example of how Clarke's unwillingness to write more than a few scrawled words on the back of a napkin and then pass it over to someone else has transmuted this once 'master' into a name publishers feel will sell fourth rate tripe."
1,God this is a bad book....,"I have just reread the whole series, book one is a very good book but each book after is geometrically worse. Book two is bad, book three is horrible, I'm at a loss to describe book four. I recommend shoving needles under your finger nails which is less painful then this series. Read and keep book one, burn the rest."
4,Still a good continuance to the story.,"Okay...so this one IS a little too ""soap-opera."" However, despite the fact that parallels to AIDS, environmentalism, and racism are rather non-subtle, I think Clarke and Lee make a very valid point: the history of the human race gives us no indication that we will ever fully be ""humane"" (a misnomer if there ever was one). When the human settlers of Rama become ""more human than human"" by engaging in those aforementioned atrocities (racism, AIDS-ophobia, destroying the environment in the name of short-term wants), I will admit to feeling frustrated--Hey, what about the happy future, utopia, etc.etc.?!?! Unfortunately, we cannot escape our genes. A thought provoking and entertaining read!"
2,Bring Me the Head of Gentry Lee!!!,"Who told Arthur Clarke that Gentry Lee could write? Why was Lee allowed to come near the master of science fiction, much less co-author a book with him? This book was disappointing in the extreme and I advise all sci-fi fans to veer away from any book with the name Gentry Lee on the cover"
2,more of the boring same,"This continues the continuation. It gives details of the ship, keeping its purpose a mystery and developing the personalities in depressingly predictable ways.It is not bad, but it simply fails to meet the mark of Clarke's solo works, which means either that his powers are failing or the co-author is doing the work.If you are a purist and serious sci-fi fan, don't bother with this. But if you are looking for a pretty good read that continues a story without surprises, this is OK. But it is only OK.I was profoundly disappointed with this, as with all of Clarke's sequels (with the exception of 2010 Space Od.) It is simply an insipid logical extension and you feel contantly that the author(s) are groping to extend it in an interesting way. I wish they didn't write this. If you are after real quality, don't get it."
1,What has happen to Clarke!,"It was like a bad car wreck, I could not look away. The main characters, Richard Wakefield and Nicole des Jardins, were impossible to enjoy. There was nothing that they could not do!I would recommend something else."
1,Wreck/Dreck of Rama,"If Rama II disappointed, avoid this one. The entire plot line is silly (as Nicole and Co. go back and forth between star systems, mostly asleep but aging) and at the end the reader is no where -- third-rate 'cliff-hanger' to get you to buy the next book. It will take another 400 pages in Rama Revealed to get to the so-called revelation. Fans of ACC will not recognize any of his ideas in this volume which basically assumes humans have learned nothing over the years: just plain ignorant, easily manipulated by political leaders, guided by superstition, and usually kill anything in sight. Most of the lead actors are mere caricatures, no personalities or redeeming features and you'll probably despise the heroine, Nicole, who is portrayed as perfect. You're more likely to be entertained by an old B-film from American International than this sludge."
4,Fantastic Series,"I can not agree with the negative reviews. I actually found Rama (the first book) the weakest (and shortest) of them all. The one that caused my emotions to come out most was the last book. Gentry Lee writes very well, I could not put the books down. I read all 4 books of this series in one go and seen in context they really are one big story, so it is hard to judge them separately. As a whole they tell one fantastic story with a stunning and tragic (open) end."
2,A boring novel,"In my opinion, Rendezvous with Rama and Rama II are very good novels. This sequel though is dreadfully boring. I really wanted to read it and like it. I bought copies of Rama II, The Garden of Rama, and Rama Revealed at the same time planning to read them all. I have tried maybe five or six times to read this novel and I fail every time. The first half of this novel is 'Nicole's Journal' and I think it was a really bad style choice. There is nothing compelling about the journal. It reads like a diary, but that isn't up to the caliber of a novel with a novel having many characters, plot and subplots, story. Being trapped in the alien spaceship really isn't that exciting anyways. It should have been much better.What I ended up doing is skimming this novel and its sequel, Rama Revealed. That way I found out what happened to the characters and was able to 'fast forward' through the dreary garbage. But I shouldn't have to do that."
3,Pretty OK.,"I think that Gentry Lee has impeeded Clarke. I heard that he wrote most of the Rama books (Clarke made up the story line), which is why sometimes they're so boring and why there's less actual science fiction. There were of course some good parts in GOR, but when I read it the third time I didn't finish it. The problem with this is that GOR is quite necessary to completely understand Rama Revealed, the next book, which I have labelled as one of my two all-time favorites."
2,A Laughable Waste of Time,"There are so many flaws with this book it is difficult to know where to begin. First of all, it isn't a very good sci-fi book. It would make a better sermon, which is really what it is trying to be anyway. Second of all, it is difficult to get past all the dis-jointed story lines and obvious continuity flaws. I mean, if the folks who went into RAMA II had all this great medical equipment, then how come the folks in GARDEN, which takes place some 70 years LATER have such crappy medical equipment? Beyond the preaching, the confusing story lines and simple plot errors, this book reads like a studebaker: clunky and slow."
2,Shoddy CD loader.,"I was a bit apprehensive about getting a trayless DVD drive but I thought Plextor had a decent reputation. After the first few DVDs, the drive broke. It is no longer possible to load a DVD. I would not recommend buying this drive. If you are dead set on the Plextor 716 get the one with the tray loading."
4,An oldie but goodie,"The title of this video is should be ""The Bobby Jones Swing Analysis"". This video breaks down Jones's graceful swing in slow motion, grip, backswing, downswing, impact and follow thru. Bobby Jones's swing (in my opinon) is just as sound as those of any of 2002 top pro golfers. I've taken lessons, read golf books, watched golf instructional video's. From this video I was able to improve some facets of my game. I'm definitely a Jones's fan now."
3,The tragedy that is censorship ruins a great CD,"Before you plop down a load of money on this out-of-print disc, be warned. I had a priority records LP from back in the 80s that had many of these songs on it, in their full 12"" versions, just like this disc. I was thinking I'd finally have them on CD thanks to Priority releasing them on disc...but I get to The Real Roxanne, and there's a blaring BEEP where she usually uses a swear word...which happens twice in the song! What a disappointment. Is this track every going to show up on CD uncensored? Track times:1. the show....doug e fresh (6:35)2. rock box...run dmc (5:28)3. nightmares...dana dane (5:53)4. fresh is the word...mantronix (5:32)5. king tut...word of mouth (4:29)6. fat boys are back...fat boys (4:28)7. roof is on fire...rockmaster scott (3:10)8. leader of the pack...utfo (4:59)9. real Roxanne...real roxanne (5:08)10. what people do for money...divine sounds (7:25)"
1,why the Music Business is seen as a joke by many,when a Act like this gets a record deal you know there are things going besides the music?Angie Martinez makes J-LO Come off like Chaka Khan by Comparrison&I Can Honestly say J-Lo AKA Jennifer Lopez is Tone Deaf.this Disc sounds like Every other Record that is out now.at least She has a Day Job?when Acts like this get Record Deals it makes the Business look even badder than it already does.
2,Remedies,I have to say when I first bought this book I thought it was worth it. For me it was not worth it. I did not keep it. Some of the stuff that it had were too deep. I had the feeling it was one of those books that you read but another book has to be in used.
2,...smells like negationism...,"In buying the book I dismissed the one negative review by ""mightyhob"". My mistake. After reading Andersonville I have to agree with him. Does the author really expect anyone to believe Wirz is a good guy because he once let a prisoner pick up a knife he dropped or a couple of other so-called acts of kindness? Or because clerics and ladies found him ""courteous and accommodating"". He even captions one photo as ""...the judge advocate who railroaded Henry Wirz"". Hardly objective, especially in the absence of anything to support it. He devotes only 4 pages to the trial, calling witness testimony exaggerated, imaginative or pure invention and referring to Wirz as deprived. I would think that if you're attempting to revise history, you need to make a better argument than the lame one put forth here. Too bad. The details of life in this prison made for some interesting reading at times."
5,The Best Quick Resource,Excellent quick reference for alternative solutions to health issues. Details what vitamins/nutrients to use and/or avoid and explains why. Provided me with an alternative way to treat my migraines which truly relieved the pain and provided insight into what may be causing them. Highly reccomended.
2,Content okay . . . Disappointing!,I have searched long and hard for a reference book and this was a let down. I felt the content was mediocre at best and important details were missing. I found a better resource on Inner Health that was very impressive at librarydepot.com It contained a Nutrition Benefits Chart that is unlike anything on the market.
5,Prescription For Nutritional Healing,"Prescription for Nutritional Healing, 4th Edition: A Practical A-to-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements ... A-To-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies)I love this book. There is a lot of good information on many different health issues. This is one of the best natural healing books that I have read."
5,Absolutely must to have if you care about yourself!,"Thank you, authors! This book makes many things clear, specially when the doctors tend to care just about charging you and do not listen to you enough. Sometimes the information in the book is even excessive. This book would never get a layer of dust on your bookshelf!"
5,Best Book Besides the Bible!! :),I use this book always!It has helped me in so many ways!It is packed with knowledge!In sight always!:)
5,Prescription for Nutritional Healing,Very helpful for just about any health issue! I would recommend it to anyone!
3,book condition,"the book was listed as new, it was not what i expected. It should have been listed as fair."
5,Nutritional Healing,This is a good book for young and old alike. It offers many natural alternative ways to stay healthy.
5,Off the Charts- Sexy Punchinella,This is an unbelievable CD and it has alot of promise and potenial for a follow CD. Can't wait to see the video. I'm hungry to hear more from Benita Charles.
2,Brake stinks,"This movie is an insult to your intelligence. As if terrorists would ever be able to turn all of those top-level people in our government. If they could do that, they have already won. And like he would be in an ambulence and just happen to drive by the Washington monument - right. How stupid. I am so sick and tired of these idiot hollywood people making movies that make the terrorists look so smart and unbeatable. We have this administration to thank for making the USA seem like we can never win."
5,Seabelts on get ready for the ride of your life,season five BN wow what can I say. What I can say is all good.if u havent seen the epis and hate spoiler dont read.First Michael starts out telling Fi that he got her this holding up a peice olumber to which Fi rwsponds u got me lumber MW says to build a shelf for your snow globes.Then he tells her that he wants her to move in with him. official boy friend /girlfriend.later in the season inter MW's biggest fo Anson Fullerton a pyschopatic pyschiatrist who is using and action that Fiona didnt do but is being framed for by Anson.

5,Loud in FL,"I love this show. The main characters have great chemistry. I hope they get back to the more fun story lines of helping people in need then the heavy, saving everyone from the bad CIA types."
5,Burn Notice 5/6,I find Burn notice a top 10 program and is a pleasure to own it is both entertaining and funny and can recommend it to anyone that likes action and humor combined
4,early hemingway writing,"Hemingway probably put these early short stories together himself when he was only 26. So these are early writings from which one can foresee his later development. His clean prose style already evident combines with acute observations of relationships and an attention to nature. His misogyny,already a hallmark, is more apparent to us today than it was in 1925."
4,Poker Chip Set,"I bought this for game nights with my boyfriend. We're not big on poker or gambling in general, just looking for something fun, and this fits the bill. I like the case. I switched out the card decks, which I didn't like as much. The chips are heavy, making the entire set super-heavy. I like it, though. It's better than something which feels dirt-cheap."
4,Good Value,"I bought this set for my son who wants to start hosting neighborhood games. He really likes them and although I am not a huge poker fan, these chips really do add a professional element to the game. Can't say much about the cards that were included since I bought a 2 deck pack of Copags. Haven't even thrown the dice yet. The case seems well made and hopefully will last as long as the chips, but I doubt it."
2,Disappointed with the misinformation,"Unfortunately, these poker chips do not weigh 8lbs as it says in the product description on the site. Instead they weigh 19 (!), and now to deliver it to my country I have to pay 3 times the price I was considering:("
5,My Favorite Pair!,"I bought these a while back, and have to tell you these are my favorite go-to sandals. Very comfy and good padding for lots of walking. Will buy more of this style, in other colors, come spring. They run true to size and width."
2,Cartel is wasted,As stated by an earlier review this album sounds like one long song. The songs all sound very similar to each other. I think that Cartel is a great band but this album is really lacking the emotion that was in Chroma. I would recommend buying that album instead.
4,I';ll never forget you.,"I don't care about ""Luck of the Irish(although I visited Ireland)but ""I'll never forget you"" is immortal and based on a play,""Berkeley Square"".One of the greatest romantic movies of all time originatd by Leslie Howard,Ashley Wilkes in ""Gone with the Wind"".It si a film classic!"
1,ONLY FOR THE BRAINLESS,Don't waste your hard earned cash on anything this know liar has written. A complete waste of time and money
2,Not much of the Commune itself,"I found this book lacking. The author spends an inordinate amount of time on a murder which was okay reading but way too long. I read on and on and on... I became very annoyed as I kept reading about the sensationalist murder. Some of the book was very interesting, but if you want to read about the Paris Commune itself you will be very disappointed, as only one chapter or so deals with it. I came away feeling ripped off."
3,Good Shit,"Compared to Racer X's first album, Second Heat takes some of its focus away from Paul Gilbert's lightning-fast guitar playing capabilities and tries to showcase the band's abilites as a whole. Jeff Smith's singing is a little more tolerable on this record than the first, sometimes its even good. The song ""Scarified"" pretty much fits all of the noodling I can handle for a whole album into three minutes. Also includes a solid cover of ""Heart of A Lion"" by Judas Priest."
4,Not enough Rent,"I expected more about Rent when I bought this book, however it is more about dealing with loss and the experiance Anthony Rapp had during Rent losing his mother. It's still a powerful story - just not the one I expected to read."
5,Couldn't put down,I loved this book so much it was hard to put down. Anthony is an incredible writer and an incredible singer to. I went to see him in RENT in my home town and was so amazed by his talent. But this book was a story about his life and his losses along the way. I am waiting a few weeks and am then going to read it again.
4,not listed clearly,"Be sure that you only want volume I. There are two volumes, but the listing for this work does not make this clear."
4,"Bought for class, read for fun",This book has a good balance of images on each page... allows for easy reading even for a history book.
2,Fair...Not Fine,"Too much annoying music (played at such a volume) that you can barely hear what the narrator is saying.Very little real insight (or information) on Gnosis.Not very long (that could be bad or good).If one didn't know any better, you would have thought you were watching an MTV Music Video by a band named ""Gnosis"".A pity...since a serious (in depth) video on Gnosis and the history of Gnosticism is greatly desired (and needed)."
5,An incredibly good training manual for Project Server.,"As a Project Server consultant and trainer, I know how hard it is for newbies to get started as this new role of a Project Server System Administrator. It's almost impossible to get started using the online books that Microsoft provides unless you already know A LOT about all the involved technologies. This book proves to be a great midway step to launch yourself in this new world.I've taught public classes using this book and didn't have to remove or add more than 10 pages of contents of my own, plus some labs to have students practice. That saved me a great deal of time and the average score I received (95%) tells it all."
4,Cube Jackin' Fo Killz!,"Kill At Will was released in 1991 the same year of his over r8ed Death Certificate, the song that got me into Cube's Kill At Will was his song Jackin' For Beats which had a tight music video to it, and in Cube's video it had Chuck D (Public Enemy) & Da Lynch Mob in it to! Dead Homiez is a sad-opressed hood song about Cube going to his own friends funerals. Good Album for only 7 songs!Best songs are 1(feat. Public Enemy), *2, 3, 5 & 7."
2,"sexy, provacative... hard ass-core!!!","This early cube' work has some boomin' beats, funny lyrics and vivid stories. Unfortunately, none would be as vivid as ice pimpin' on the cover/ posing with his gat. Hard as a mo' fo' and then too much filler. Most solid effort on this resume would be the mighty but antagonistic effort "" GET OFF MY D*CK AND TELL YO' B*TCH TO COME HERE..."" yeah that's a great one! works on my wife every time, (like one of the APHRODESIACS! ... or slippin her a micky!)"
5,A must for any Cube fan,"This is a great CD, just another example of Ice Cube's talent. It includes a few Ice Cube classics like ""Jackin for the Beats"" and a few other choice hits. If you love Ice Cube you can't miss this CD."
3,Something was missing...,"I was so excited to see a new Stephanie Laurens book but, as I read, I kept feeling that something was missing!! The book just didn't seem to enthrall me! The premise was interesting but the book just didn't measure up!! Amanda was way too cocky, Martin just wanted to have sex, in public, over and over again! Once she got him hooked, then she put him off... I don't know, just frustrating and formulated somehow! Not one of the best!! I guess even great authors have their ""off days""! We'll just have to see how Amanda's twin sister, Amelia fares in the next one!! Happy reading!!!!! :-)"
4,Amanda Cynster's Story,I love this family and all of the books that I have read. This is Amanda's story and she is all grown up now!Amanda is not thrilled with the men of the ton and sets out to find the perfect mate. She goes to the dark and shadowy side of the ton to find the man strong enough to be her husband. A Man like her cousins. She finds Martin Earl of Dexter. Martin has his own skeleton in the closet and has left the fashionable world for the shadows of the ton. He resucues Amanda and finds himself drawn to her against his better judgement.Amanda and Martin's story is typical Stephanie Laurens tale and there are plenty of characters that make a reapperance in this story. At times it seemed to slow down but for the most part is was a good story. If you are a fan of this family you won't want to miss this story.
4,Stephanie Laurens delivers,"I found this book fun, witty and enjoyable. I read to escape from the day to day grind and this was a good escape. I enjoyed visiting with the Cynster clan again. They are like old friends and it is nice to drop in and see where the others are a few years later with children and other responsibilities. I enjoyed the ""macho"" seen between the hero and the Cynster males. It reminded me of my brothers."
1,Sigh...blah,"Whereas ""Devil's Bride"" remains one of my all-time, won't-ever-loan-it-out, dog-eared favorites, this was a sad disappointment. Character development was non-existent and I skipped the sex because it couldn't hold my attention. I gave this book away at the first opportunity."
2,Really pretty dull and uninspired.,"Amanda is likable, but I don't see much that would have inspired an obsession like the one Martin developed for her. She was pretty conniving, but I don't fault her for that. If I met a handsome rake at a gaming hell I might try and snag him too. But she snags him in such a BORING way. There's no pizzazz to the way she goads him into escorting her to all of these supposedly scandalous outings. There was so much potential for sexual sizzle at the various outings, but instead they were really boring.Stephanie Laurens is always wordy, but this book was out of control. The sex scenes were so boring and incredibly painful to get through. There's so much fluff that you can barely tell they are having sex! It's such flowery prose and totally pointless blather.After reading an author like Robin Schone, this was lame. I still like S.L., but she's definitely not my favorite."
3,If you love the Cynsters series,"I've recently read this series up to this title.I've enjoyed all of Ms. Laurens books - and find that this one, although not as interresting as some of her previous work in this series, is particularly hot, if you enjoy the love scenes.The next book, however, with Amelia as the next Cynster in line to get married - is dreadfully infantile in its early development. I DO hope it gets better."
5,Couldn't put it down!!!,"This was one of the best romances I've read in a while. The story kept me glued to the pages and the love scenes-wonderful! I did get a little frustrated with Amanda's drawn out refusal to marry Martin but the erotic rendezvous it generated more than made it worth while. Both characters were strong and intellegent and their mind games stimulating. I was also surprised at how easily Amanda was able to get around, but again, the story was so captivating I had little time to dwell on waht ""reality"" would have been. Fabulous read, my favorite Cynster novel yet. Can hardly wait to read Amelia's story."
4,Another Cynster Family Winner,"If you enjoyed the Bar Cynster books to date then this one will be no exception. Amanda Cynster after 6 years of being ""out"" in the ton has decided that her choices are rather bleak. Oh she has people that want her dowery but she longs for the ""love mate"" that all of her cousins and uncles have found. What would we expect.She and her twin decide to take different approaches and are basically separated for the first time in their man hunt. Amanda decided to take things into her own hands and live a bit on the wild side. Though she is tempting fire she decided to visit a few of the less approved of establishments. There she meets Martin (Dexter) who she doesn't even know is an Earl when she first meets him. But she decides he is the one for her.Following her ""game"" and watching her both learn and fall in love are fun. This is a true sensual Stephanie Laurens classic."
4,Super Gals Season 2,"Except for being in Japanese w/ subtitles, the series is as good as the first season"
3,Misleading,"The collection is high quality, but it's Japanese with subtitles. The English dubbing of it will come out sometime later, but all twenty-six episodes of the second season are here. Character development, which was somewhat lacking in the first season because of its major focus on Ran, is a bit more thorough; Second Place and Machida Black get their fair share in the spotlight, as well as new characters, like Tatsukichi's little brother. The subbing isn't too bad and the stories are even more hilarious than the first series. If you're a fan of English dubs, you might want to wait until the true English dub of this comes out. If you don't care, though, this is a great collection!"
2,Brock's review,"This book has good information on how to cultivate ginseng but it was written in the early twentieth century so prices and other pertinent information is very out dated. Furthermore, the pictures are, for the most part, indistinguishable."
3,Battery Killer,"Works well, especially for the price. Only issue I have with this product is that it drains batteries so quickly, I had to buy rechargeable batteries to use."
5,Great CD,"I love this CD. Craig has a beautiful voice. The songs he selected are all great. After hearing ""You're Nothing Without Me"", I brought the City of Angels Soundtrack and also like it alot."
2,Didnt get the book!,"I never got the book, but my money was returned to me shortly after I was notified. I was sord of bummed cuz I really needed that book."
1,Flimsy Construction,I have been putting furnature for over 10 years and have never com across a product so poorly designed and unstable. Pricy too.....
4,Perfect Acoustic Pop Music,"I have followed Kepano Green since Day 1, and though they have yet to sign a deal with a major label and stayed independent, I can attest to the excellence in song craftmanship as well as vocal chops from this duo. Their songs are original and blended harmonies, just flawless. It's been a couple of years since this album, but I highly recommend anyone who wants to kick back, and listen to good, go-with-the-flow, acoustic guitar/piano music, this is the perfect album for them! If you like Valley Drive, CHECK OUT THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS!"
5,Wow! What a powerful text.,"Every once in a while I come across a book that I just do not want to put down and this is one of them. Not only is it right on the mark, it is also interesting and thought provoking. I know I will be buying copies for my frineds so they too can be inspired and apply the ways of Jesus in a their life everyday."
2,This CD is Horrible,Track 1 and 4 are decent. The rest is a pile of garbage. I bought every No Limit Release from Ghetto D to Snoop. I must say every thing from Silkk's Made Man on SUCKS
2,"Excuse me, but Joaquin was a blond...","If the Midwest Review reports that Murrieta received prejudice because of his color--and they got that info from the book, then there's something wrong with that ""impeccable research,"" as Frank F. Latta has documented thoroughly that Joaquin was a tall, light-eyed, light haired blond called ""Huero."" He came from a very large and fairly well off family from a town in Sonora. Okay, okay, I'll read it and get back to you!"
4,for live lovers only,"If you want a smooth polished studio CD to listen to over and over again, you probably don't enjoy Anders live in concert or on this disc. He is highly experimental, always recreating his style and jamming old songs in new ways. This CD is indicative of that originality and consequently captures the spirit of Anders Osborne far better than any previous release."
5,VERY GOOD,"This is a good offering from STEADY MOBBNbefore they left the NO LIMIT label,BOUT THAT MESS is the best song and overall the cd is very strong.I ALSO RECOMMEND GAMBINO FAMILY AND PRIME SUSPECTSPS PICK UP SILKK THE SHOCKER CDS - he is underrated on no limit"
4,Generally good advice,"This book addresses a problem that is common in troubled relationships and offers some very good advice on how to deal with it. The only drawback that I really see is that the book addresses only that one problem in relative isolation, and troubled relationships often suffer from other problems as well. But, so long as you keep its somewhat narrow focus in perspective, and don't fall into the easy trap of believing that solving this one problem will make everything all right, it is a marvelous tool for improving communications in relationships."
3,Not my cup of tea...,"I had to read this for a psychology class. As I am not a psych. major, it wasn't my idea of fun reading. I found it really difficult to get totally into the book as I usually do when reading. It was slow reading. However, there were many insights that the author made that I found very interesting."
5,Degrees of separation.,"Desmond Morris has created an extremely provocative and challenging book that forces one to question ""humanity's"" everyday and all-time reactions and motivations. It challenges one to analyse and understand whether we are as intelligent as we think. This book is as valid today as it was when it was written 40 years ago. Our arrogance in seeing ourselves as being intelligent beings is exposed or at least called into question. The Naked Ape, used well, forces one to continually re-assess and measure society's and one's own behaviour."
5,a must read,A great book for anyone with an open mind. Very thought prokoving and interesting. A must read.
5,An excellent instrumental album,"First of all, the correct track listing of the album is as follows:1. Arrival 2. Bittersweet 3. Be 4. Escapism 5. Luna 6. Mama 7. Loneliness 8. SiberiaThis CD was the first Maarty Friedman CD of mine. I have heard ""Bittersweet"" and it was incredible. It was so melodic that I felt like I was listening melodies from heaven.I couldn't find it in my home country so tried to search it on the internet. The track listing I found was the one given by amazon.com and that's why I have mentioned the listing here.As you may know, Marty Friedman is Megadeth's guitarist but this album is far away from Megadeth's style. It sounds like classical music played by guitar, keyboard and drums. No vocals. My personal favorites are: ""Bittersweet"", ""Be"", ""Loneliness"". In fact all of the songs are very very good.If you like melodic music I strongly recommend you this album."
5,Great alternative to a black tea,"This rooibos tea is a great alternative to black teas. There is a subtle taste of honey that permeates the tea making sugar or a sugar alternative unnecessary. This is a robust, but gentle tasting red tea. If you read Alexander McCall-Smith's Ladies Detective Agency books, the rooibos tea features prominently in the series. The lead heroine, Precious is often found brewing a cup of rooibos. After drinking this tea, I see why it is her favorite."
3,"Fine, but overpriced","It's a binder. It's functional. But for a pricier binder, I kind of expected the pockets to be better and a heftier feel in general. Next time I'll just go to a big box store."
4,YLD,Your Last Diet is a companion to The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program and is worth picking up if you are sugar sensitive.
5,Various Artists,"The number one Christmas cassette in our family and circle of friends is ""Christmas Comedy Classics"" various artists. Gets us in the mood for Christmas. We clean, we cook, we talk, we laugh and we sing along. Very up beat. And we SHOP! All to the music from this cassette."
5,The Gateless Gate,"This book was my first introduction to zen writing and still is a favorite. Nice collection of writings by different authors, contemporary and classic, on the elusive subjects of zen, truth, and awareness. Inclusion of non-Zen writings, particularly from the Gospel of Thomas and Alan Watts, makes this a more universal, but perhaps less authentic, description."
2,Rehashes Basic Information,"Most of the information in her book is available on cable TV for free. She gives very little specific information regarding anything about how to play. If you want info on how to join a slot club, available free at any casino, then this book is for you. Otherwise, forget it."
2,Interesting in Parts but the Whole is Disappointing,"Every time I turn on show about casinos or Las Vegas, the author of this book is being featured. I can understand why. She is a grandmotherly type, the antitype of the desperate casino gambler, and she seems so ordinary. Yet, she supposedly beats the casinos at their own game. That would be extraordinary. But when I read the book I got a very different opinion. Some of her ""methods"" are just not applicable to most casino gamblers. Some of them are ""cheesy."" I think this book is more hype than content, although some of the information in parts is interesting. I am sure there are much better books and authors out there who actually explore how to play the various games and what strategies to use."
1,Too much like work,Parts of this book are interesting but what the author advocates is like going to work instead of having fun. Most of us plan our vacations for pleasure. This book is good if your job is trying to get comped at a casino. A disappointment for those of us who want good strategies.
2,Good info for video poker newcomers.,"If you have no background in the wold of video poker and casino comp policies, this book is a decent place to start. If however, you have played in casinos or even read other information about comp policies, you will find this book very elementary. I found this book to be short on useful information. I expected better personal stories about the authors casino experiences. The writing is long winded and repetitive."
3,Enjoyed it!,"This was a good book and I really enjoyed it. If this is your kind of book, read ""Arc Light"", by Eric L. Harry. It'll keep your interest for hours and is sort of a companion book to this."
4,ice cubes best album yet,"this in my opinion is ice cubes best album dropped yet. this is the type of album you can play over and over again. this has some dope bass lines in it. i never liked ice cube until this album, if your a fan of west coast rap, get this album.. this aint no fake a-s wu tang sh*t'no limit, HA! hella greedy' - ice cube"
5,Fast delivery,The book was in the same conditions as described when I bought it and it came in time.
2,Classic but tedious storyline,"When a widely-disliked man is found dead at the vicar's house, he wants to be part of the investigation. Among the other village residents who keep turning up, asking whodunit, is Miss Marple.In this first book in the Miss Marple series, she does not show to advantage; she's a nosy village spinster, and the storyline itself dragged terribly. I had trouble keeping the characters straight and finally skipped to the end."
2,Not the Strongest Christie,This one was not well-received when it was published -- for good reason. There are some major leaps a reader must make to believe in a lot of what transpires.
3,Timekeeper Retro Wall Clock,The clock looks nice but hard to read. I painted the tips black to see the time better. Also the clock is on the loud side with every second that ticks by.
5,"Phenomenal movie - from story, to acting, to directing 5 stars!","From the moment ""Waking Madison"" opens you are drawn into a dark and difficult world of Madison Walker. Her 30 day journey to document herself and those in her life is woven with the true art of a storyteller and filmed with as much passion as the actors bring to their characters. I cannot say enough good things about this film. I watched this film all in one go, ignoring phone calls, social media, and even my barking dogs - I was riveted to the screen.Stunning visuals accompany stellar performances to bring to life the sort of psychological battles raised with the concepts of mental disorder and suicidal tendencies. When you sit down to watch this film - turn off all distractions. You won't want to miss a minute. This film is not just worth watching - it's worth discussing with everyone you know.Congratulations to cast and crew for a truly phenomenal film."
2,Get this book if you have a strong background in math.,I found the examples highly theoretical and (like other reviewers) would have liked to see more of an explanation of the results. Lite on discussion of matrices. Some additional pictures would have also helped. I have learned from it in spite of my shortcomings.
5,The title says iit all,This book is a well written reminder of the character of human spirit. There survival is nothing short of miraculous.
5,Amazing!,This story is absolutely amazing! How anyone could survive the conditions these men lived through is truly a miracle. A fascinating read!
5,An incredible journey,I like this book Endurance very much; it is very phat and has a lot of action. I told everyone I know about it. Some have read it and it got rave reviews
5,Inspiring Story!,"For someone who hardly reads, I could not put this book down once I started reading. I had borrowed a copy from the library based on the customer rating at Amazon and glad I I read it!"
5,Incredible story!,"I had read this book years ago and remembered that it was an incredible story, so recently I ordered it to reread it. It truly is a page-turner! I could barely put it down. It definitely was worth rereading."
5,A real page turner!,Can't put it down. Excellant read. One of the best finds this year. Authors like these make you love your Kindle!
5,A supreme example of the human spirit at its best,"If this were a work of fiction, it would be unbelievable. As historical fact, it is the tale of extraordinary men, their indomitable courage and their loyalty to each other."
5,Endurance/Shacketon,This book is one of the best I have ever read. Reading the book for the first time several years ago pompted us to do a trip to Antarctia. The story of how all members of the expedition lived on ice flows for several months and through the Antarctic winter is one of the best stories of courage and bravery ever told.
3,Amazing Tale,"This is one of the most incredible stories of survival I have ever read. Earnest Shackleton and the crew of the Endurance set sail from England in 1914 in an attempt to become the first explorers to cross Antarctica on foot. They never were able to start their overland journey as they spent two years trapped in pack ice and battling the Antarctic seas.Despite losing their ship, The Endurance, to the pack ice, Shackleton successfully led his men to safety. Battling heave pack ice, unfavorable weather, and formidable seas, Shackleton finally reached help two years after they had started their journey. Even more incredible is the fact that not a single crew member was lost. Supplementing their food stores with penguins and seals, the crew stayed alive. Alfred Lansing, using diaries of the crew and first hand interviews, does an amazing job of telling the story of Shackleton and his crew"
5,Incredible Non-Stop Reading Voyage,"At 3:30 am this morning I began reading this book and did not stop until I'd finished all 280 pages 8 a half hours later. A non-stop reading adventure. And I am not a book reader and have never read a book in less than 3 days. What a story! All factual. And what a vivid description-- it makes movies seem pale. This book defines the meaning incredible. IF you love outdoor adventures and have a few harrowing experiences of your own, this book will grab you. Warn your family before going away on this voyage."
5,Edurance,"It is amazing how these men, in a spirit of cooperation, never gave up hope and continued on, enduring one horrible condition after another. Endurance, accurately describes the name of the boat, the book and all it took for those that survived."
5,Easily the best nonfiction book I have ever read.,"The most amazing thing about Lansing's account of Shackleton's ill-fated voyage to Antarctica is that it really happened. Had someone manufactured this story, it would not be believable. To have endured the unimaginable hardships that Shackleton and his crew faced seems impossible. The fact that Shackleton returned each crew member alive is utterly incomprehensible. Lansing's account of the adventure is gripping, accurate and heart-stopping."
1,i thought it was boreing and was too repetitive.,"i really thought that the same events and problems kept on comming up over and over and over again, i would NEVER reccomend this for a book report, its not good for that, cuz thats what i had to do and i got a bad grade for being too repetitve of myself...bye."
4,TOO Far Gone it was.......,"A solid hard rock debut from 9.0. A little known band that rode in on the last wave of the Hair Metal extravaganza. Had a hell of a guitar player! Album starts off w/ an ambitious opener (Too Far Gone) title track and kicks into other tracks as well. This band SHOULD have been huge but fell death to well...shall I say FALSE METAL?? (GRUNGE) ring a bell anyone?? I think this release would have done better IF it were to have come out in the mid 80s! But I own it, so its a great record in my book.Cheers!"
4,A great introduction to Conrad,"A powerful tale of human interaction in the confines of a sailing ship. Conrad mixes technical details with poetic prose in a style that is very enjoyabe to read. A relatively short book, this makes a delightful introduction to Conrad. Perhaps the best tale of the seas written."
1,Just Plain Awful...,"Several reviewers have already done an excellent job of stating the many, many flaws with this book.The only thing I can add is it's just plain awful. I would give it zero stars if I could."
3,Refreshingly rootsy and honest,"Some of these songs are much better than others, but on the whole this compilation is a great sampling of contemporary roots country, happily devoid of ""alternative"" cheek and/or Nashville-style fluff. A great starter kit for those just turning on to country music."
2,Metric drill bit set,The set is metric 1 to 5.9 x 0.1mm drill bits. A mixed set of mostly black oxide (some bright) UK & Chinese with a few from Japan & USA. Lengths vary erratically. Many bits were shortened from longer ones then resharpened & reblackened. The resharpening was poorly done producing improper point geometries including points not being centered. A drill bit's web thickens along the length which also affects a cut-down bit's resharpening. Several bits had bent ends that would actually wobble the part in the drill press. The company kindly replaced the wobbly ones but bits that are stepped every 0.1mm are bought for precision metal work which would be hard to achieve with this set. The quality control is just not there. I didn't use the set for a while so problems not noticed in time for a replacement or refund. Comes in a nice Huot index.
4,The Great Christian Church Fathers...,"This book is an excellent text for those who are solely interested in the topic for pure curiosity and for those who are interested in doing a little research. The author, Richardson, has put together an excellent compilation of letters, and journal entires of various prominent early Christians. There are letters from the famous St. Polycarp, to the early Bishop St. Ignatius (not the Jesuit Ignatius) depicting the events and thoughts leading up to their martyrdoms. There are also letters from the early Popes illustrating the various problems the early church faced. All in all an excellent read for the beginner and for the far advanced. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in biographical information pertaining to the Early Chirstian Fathers."
1,Misleading Title - Poorly written basics,"There is no 2 year plan that will lead you to a million in real estate laid out in this book. It is an imperfect tale of real estate basics and a few stories worked in for flavor. Its more of a cheerleading book for real estate investment but im thinking when you get to the point where you are buying real estate books on amazon you need some real meat and potatos... buying this book wont be the worst mistake you ever made...but there are many that cover similar material in a much better way. Personally i stay away from the Donald Trump, Carlton Sheets, infomercial real estate types, and go with authors that have a long term, realistic, and workable approach to real estate."
2,Overall good book but some shady advice...,"Overall it's a good book but he does give some rather shady advice such as how to obtain financing for down payments. He says things like ""family and friends"" ""private investors"" ""hard money lenders"" The only real way to obtain money is really to just work 2 jobs while living at your parents house for a year or two making huge sacrifices, but he doesn't say this...Also, this book was written in 2006 before the big real estate crash. Would his leveraging plan still have worked? I don't know.. Maybe I'll have to read his new book.All in all, it's only 10 dollars. There are a lot of good things he does say. Good explanation on CAP rates. And he does make a strong argument on why owning multi-family houses/apartments is better than owning multiple condos or single family homes."
5,you Must read Matt's book,"I just finished reading your book. Excellent. The best one I've read yet. It explains the real, traditional way to buy properties.Robert G.Staten Island, NY"
5,"How you can, too","Can you quit your day job to make a million in real estate? You can if you have Matthew A. Martinez's 2 YEARS TO A MILLION IN REAL ESTATE in hand: it comes from one who worked hard until he acquired his first rental property and worked at it - two years later he was making more in rentals than in his job. Today he holds a portfolio consisting of several millions of income-producing properties - and his tips on how he did it - and how you can, too - are offered in a guide covering everything from real estate 'bubble' mistakes to picking and financing hot properties.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,"special, historical character Barbie","This seller provided me with careful, personal attention, when I said I had a time urgency for delivery. She also informed me honestly about a slightly damaged package (her description was worse than the actual problem). I am very happy with this purchase (this Barbie doll is unlike any I have seen - not the usual kitsch) and with the great service."
4,Princess,"I like the Princess of France she's gorgeous; but her hair should be a little shorter; because in reality, French Princesses hair is not that long and she's kinda looks just like, ""Barbie."" Therefore, Barbie Co needs more work on understanding cultures' looks. Also, needs to expand more different cultures, Dolls of the World, barbies; such as, where's Germany, America, Native Indians, Canada, and so on!? Barbie Co usually chose the same countries to make Dolls of the World and it's fine but needs to expand countries too, thank you."
1,a friend loves it for tangly hair ... I dont.,"A friend suggested shampoo this for snarly long hair.I tried it.I cant remember if it worked,I remember that the ingredients made me kind of sick ... but then I am hypersensitive to chemicals"
1,Short lifetime,I bought my HG281D in Feb 08. While it worked I was happy with it. However it died after 3.5 years - just 6 months after the warranty expired. I contacted HannsG service: they advised me to take it to a local repair shop. HannsG did not respond to my pointing out that the monitor is just 6 months older than the warranty they provide.I am very disappointed: I expect a longer lifetime from a monitor that back then costed $600.In fact this monitor is the one with by far the shortest lifetime I ever bought.If you browse a bit around on the Web you will notice that Hanns G monitors seem to have a way above average rate of failures. I will never buy this brand again.
3,flickers with late 2008 Macbook Pro,I wish this display would work fine for me - but it doesn't - with my new (latest fall 2008 model) Macbook Pro it starts to flicker or gets noisy after a few sleep-wake-up cycles. The only way to fix that is to disconnect and reconnect the cable. Too bad - a beautiful monitor when it works...
1,"Buyer Beware, does not live with promises.","I received my item in a nice container, set up easily and lo and behold. the quality of this monitor is so poor, 2 days later i can't really set it up like what other user said. I search on the web about the issue of this monitor and found out this monitor have a lot of issue. i can't return this monitor anymore in original box.So buyer beware, too bright , low quality, color flicker,it dim and bright suddenly, poor control placement and so on. you can check it out this website about the problem regarding this monitor or search on google + issue and you will see the forum regarding this item . If i can rate this to zero star , i will do it."
5,Great monitor,Purchased Sept. 2009 and it's never given me a problem. As someone with middle-aged eyes I love the size of the print and video looks great. A lot of bang for the buck.
3,A mixed bag,"This had all the requirements we needed - water-based and ships by Prime (a weak criterion, I know). Cherries didn't seem like a bad choice of scent, whereas the other flavors in this line were all quite unappealing to us. So I ordered the cherry. It smells like cherry cough syrup, or like the cherry liquid soap we used to use to clean out the pool bathrooms! Disgusting. Also, it is supposedly warming (according to the label), but it was not. In those two respects it was bad. However, the texture was good, and since it is water-based it's easy to clean up. The cherry scent seems to dissipate quite quickly, leaving an unscented product. We will continue to use it until it's gone, but if you are truly looking for something cherry-scented and warming, look elsewhere."
4,A Misleading Title,"If the book has a theme, it is that the Dynasty and the Empire were not in irreversible decline and the fall, brought about by defeat in WWI, was not inevitable. Why the title then? Well, towards the end of the book, in a couple of chapters added to the second edition, Sked admits that the title was chosen by his publishers and not by him.My main reason for contributing this review is that I don't think it is clear from other reviews here that Sked's book is not a narrative or comprehensive history of the Habsburg Empire from the Congress of Vienna until its fall. It is rather a series of essays which reflect on other historians' treatment of some of the major themes in Habsburg historiography. These are interesting, challenging, occasionally repetitive, but are not, and do not pretend to be, a substitute for a general history of the period (such as C.A. Macartney's great work)."
3,A big let down,"I bought the second edition under the misleading impression that the contents will be updated, even though the conclusions may still stand. Instead, I have a book that's 95% same as before, plus some random afterthoughts on the main thesis that the Habsburg Monarchy self imploded because of losing the war, and not from the rampant nationalities conflict in an age of nationalism. If you want to read Sked's work on the Monarchy, just buy some second hand first edition.And if you want a refreshing look at European history, look no further than Paul Schroeder's majestic The Transformation of European Politics."
5,"What Stephanie Thorpe, a Virgina teenage thought.",I felt the book displayed perfectly the every day struggle of not only a teenage in school but also as a female in a male dominated part of society seeking acceptance of her peers. It also displayed that a woman can do what men do just as well as they can. This book captured perfectly a young woman dealing with everyday teenage problems and then some not so everyday problems while all the time shriving for and finally reaching her goals in her field of study. This book has taught me that no matter what life throws your way as long as you believe in yourself you can do anything you set out to do.
5,purse candy mold,What a fun piece. I paired this with the shoe candy mold and have been using them on cakes. I will visit the site again to see what else is available
2,Built in amp did not work,"I purchased this guitar for my 7 year old daughter. When I received the guitar the built in amp did not work. The power light came on as normal but it had no sound at all. This guitar does come with an amp cable though and does have the hook up port for an amp, so I went and bought an amp for it, and it worked great with the amp I bought. This guitar is a real electric guitar for beginners. It's not just a toy. It is ideal size for a small child. Just don't have high expectations on the built in amp working!!! If the amp had worked I would have given this item a 5 star rating."
4,Dave Clarke - Devil's Advocate,"Dave Clarke has always been known for his sharp, hard techno, and on DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, he doesn't stray from from his tried-and-true approach (listen to ""Just Ride"" if you're not convinced), but he does take some interesting detours. The chanting on ""She's in Parties"" from Chicks on Speed, for instance, or the squealing and ghetto-effects to accompany Mr. Lif's vocals on ""Blue on Blue."" But better yet is when he sticks to his guns, like on the tech-house of ""Stay Out of the Light"" or the electro-breaks of ""Addendum."" The more things change..."
4,Wife loved it,"Bought this book for the wife and she loves it. She was looking for something to teach her teen girls class and has found some very good ideas in the pages of this book. She has read me a lot of it and we both have found it very useful in our lives as well. It may say, Becoming a Woman...who listens to God - but we men could use some of these points to get close to HIM as well! Thanks"
5,Nick is finally back!,"I have to admit..the last soul album was not my favorite...but ""WHATS LEFT OF ME"" is definitely a great album! Taking all the tabloid drama aside...this is Nick raw and soulful! The lyrics to every song...touch your heart and his voice is at it's best! I recommend this to all fans!"
3,At least this is better than SoulO...,"Nick Lachey is back with his sophomore album. He basically conformed to the popular ""rockish"" pop sound that is now becoming the norm. (Basically the male version of Kelly Clarkson's latest album, except not nearly as good.)A few songs stand out, such as ""Beautiful,"" ""On Your Own,"" and of course the radio-released ""What's Left Of Me."" The CD screams ""make me more successful than Jessica at any cost,"" which is too bad because it's not going to happen.The songs are (for the most part) well crafted but unfortunately Lachey's pretentious, boy band voice, leaves a lot to be desired."
1,This is as bad as SoulO,"I really cant think of any worse sounding cd than this one.Nick Lachey is very annoying and just cant sing.This album is awful,disgusting,vapid,soulless,pungent,repulsive and sick.This is as bad as any Backstreet boys album.Give this a miss and purchase the latest album from The Vines which is miles better than this."
1,Oh GET OVER IT!,"Jeez, I almost vomited when I heard that he was coming out with another CD. He has some of the worst vocals I have ever heard, and plus he needs to get over the fact that he split up with Jessica. What's Left of him? NOTHING.And sorry for making my review so short, this is all I can say."
2,Whta's the big deal !,"OK I kinda do feel sorry for Nick for marrying that spiled little blond bimbo. But at the same time it doesn't justify the lack of real depth on this album. Yes it has soulfull lyrics about brea ups and all that mushy stuff. But let's be honest , cheesy love songs like these we hear before. All the producers of N'SYNC, Backstret Boys, and countless other teenage pop music producers spit dozens of these in a week.It is simply the same old tired stuff. Nice mellodies to listen to but really not much besides that."
3,Pitch of the music is too high,The pitch is too high. You'd need to turn the volume up but by the time your done with one song your ears would be burning.
5,The Best!!!!,"This cd is far superior to his debut, Soulo. You can hear his heart and feel his pain. I enjoy every single track...."
5,One of the best comeback Cd's!!,"Nick Lachey hits a homerun with his second Soul Cd entitled ""What's Left of Me"". This cd is filled with emotions, and allows the listener an insight to Nick's life. This cd is a huge step up from his first soul attempt. A MUST BUY!!! You will not be sorry with this purchase! I love it and you will too!!"
5,Classic Soul,"along the lines of His first Greatest Hits Album.you can't deny this Man when He was at His Artistic Soulful Peak.His Voice together with the Memphis Funk band that backed Him up is unstoppable with His Smooth Falsetto.""Love&Happiness""&""Full Of Fire"" are my Summer time jams!! dig those Horns&His Soulful Pipes on the Groove.Classic.I wish Al Green would Show the Current Crop of R&B Acts how it is truly done??"
4,6-Film Holiday Collectors Set,I have looked at these movies and I love them. I love all the Christmas Movies. I saw these and wanted to add to my movies.
3,6-film Holiday collection V.3,"Decent, but little more than that. The 'Child's Christmas in Wales' film was interesting because the foreign perspective makes it less predictable. Can't say I'd buy this again, although the price on these 'collections' is low, and I suppose that the value for the money isn't bad."
3,Avon Ultimate Eye System,"I've used Avon for over 30 years. This product, for me, is just so so. I prefer the clinical eye cream line. I don't think this helped my eye area look any younger, but everyone is different and the clinical line is my favorite. I would not purchase this item again."
2,NEW FORMULA,"The new Anew formula that has glitter is very irriating. I will NOT buy it again.I loved the old contouring eye cream, I don't think they needed to change it."
4,an excellent summer moisturizer for young skin,"I loved this moisturizer during the summer but alas, I won't be reordering now that the cod has set in. I have normal non-breakout prone, but I do need a bit of a heavier moisurizer for the winter.It does as promised (neutralizing the t-zone, etc.) and the smell is feminine. I would reccommend this for girls under 30 y/o because it lacks a bit in the revitalizing department. But do note that this cream does not contain SPF. LUSH sells another (more expensive) cream which does."
2,"It is hard to say, it is working or not","I was taking the other prasenta pill, then It worked very much. But I got it this time, I don't know it is working or not.I hope it is working..."
4,Very interesting,"This is a very interesting CD. It's meditative and lively at the same time. I was surprised to hear a piano solo in the middle of it. It's a very different sound that you won't find in music from other countries. If you enjoy world music, I would suggest adding this CD to your collection.I agree that listening to the entire CD in one sitting is a bit much, but I enjoy it and it always makes me feel good. It's not the typical 4:4 rhythms of the US/European music."
4,Isuzu Air Filter,"Replaced old air filter with this filter. It fit properly and so far is working properly. Did not see a lot of change in power, accerleration or gas mileage."
4,Two Smooth Jazz Hits,"I agree that Show Me the Honey and Spice are the best numbers on this CD, one of many great albums by my second favorite smooth jazz group."
5,DLO jacket for MP3 player,This jacket fit perfectly and protects my MP3 player very nicely. I am glad I bought this.
1,AutoCAD 2002 Complete,"I thought book will throw some light on new features of AutoCAD 2002. But, it contains few randomnly selected articles for AutoCAD 2000. If you have some previous publications for AutoCAD 2000 from Sybex, you need not buy this book. Because, this book speeks more about AutoCAD 2000 and speeks very less about new features of AutoCAD 2002."
4,Classic fantasy fiction,"The Castle of Llyr is the third book in the Chronicles of Prydain. Princess Eilonwy is sent off to the care of the King and Queen of Mona to become a lady. When Taran accompanies her, he finds a romantic rival as well as a sinister plot. This book was just as cute as the earlier books--maybe a little cuter because of Taran's frustrating realization that he is romantically interested in Eilonwy."
3,A useful book on early childhood development from a Waldorf perspective,"A good introduction to the Waldorf philosophy and approach regarding the developmental stage from birth to age 6 or 7. Even if you are not ""into"" Waldorf or anthroposophy (the underlying philosophy of Waldorf education), there are helpful tips contained in this little book. It is somewhat ""Waldorf light"", which is good for those who don't subscribe to or believe in all elements of Waldorf education and anthroposophy.I have referred many times to the suggestions regarding age-appropriate stories, and which fairy & folk tales to introduce at what age. The ""rainbow bridge"" story itself has become a special part of birthday celebrations in our family.There are also some helpful, though not in-depth, tips on discipline.A lot of the book is in question-and-answer format."
3,supercilious,"I read this book because I had met someone who had named their firstborn after the hero and he felt it was the best book he had ever read so I had to read it. I think it doesn't translate very well from russian I think I counted the word , supercilious used at least 5 times. Its political and gives you a flavor of life in russia at that time but for asthetics it lacked evolution of character."
4,How to power tune Rover V-8 for Road & Track,"Pretty good review of the history of the Engine with specifics of the internal dimensions and differences in models forming the bulk of the product, not enough details for performance modifications and in particular power output/torque curves for specific alterations/modificationsAll in all good value for money."
5,Really useful and comfortable,"I am a total snob when it comes to what I sleep on. I love a good mattress. So usually when I go camping with my husband I'm always behind him dragging some huge monstrous 5inch thick foam mattress or something equally impractical. Well, I bought this to have a bed to sleep on at my mom's house. I got it because it was a little cheaper than a futon, more practical because you can deflate it and it comes with a tote bag. And it won top marks on consumer reports. I'm used to air beds sounding like balloons and when my husband or I get up off of an air bed the other person goes flying. But this bed was a total wonder. It felt almost like a real mattress. It is REALLY comfortable and I'll use it all the time, for guests and for when I travel and go camping. My husband totally balked at the price and thought it was ridiculous but when he slept on it, he conceded that it was a good idea. And he actually really likes it now, too."
1,leaks with slow poor service on warrenty,I bought this as a guest bed so didn't find out that it leaks through the night until after the 30 money back period was over. To return it I had to cut out the heavist part and send it in at my own expense. I am supposed to recieve a new one but it's been weeks now with no word. This is a poor quality product with poor customer service behind it.Very unimpressed and will never buy another aerobed product.
1,Dayco 89037 Idler Pulley Does NOT fit 2002 Saturn SC2,"This item, Dayco 89037 Idler pulley is listed as fitting my 2002 Saturn SC2 1.9L. However it DOES NOT FIT this vehicle. Not sure if a different item because my car was one of the last cars to be made in that model, does not fit 2001-2 models or what. I selected the make, model and year at the top of screen and it said it fit, but then gave some sort of instruction notes not related to an idler pulley. Guess that should have been a clue. If I recall correctly (returned over a week ago) this pulley is smaller than OEM factory by about 1 inch diameter. A little bigger may have been ok, but smaller would run out the automatic tensioner faster, in my opinion. Fortunately they did allow me to return item for a full refund."
2,ho hum,"Timeless classic of the Mexican ""epoca dorada""...yawn. This may be of interest to students of Mexican film, and those interested in the development of the official ideology they seem to have of ""indigenous Mexican stuff is good"", or whatever it is, but it really ain't a very gripping film, and in technical terms, it comes across as quite old and primitive. Don't expect ""The Gold Rush"" or ""Grand Illusion"", either, which continue to be enthralling films despite being presented in flickering black and white with static camera work.The female lead, Dolores del Rio, who plays the virtuous, suffering ""india"", is as white as they come, which, I suppose, might be regarded as amusing in so far as the wicked shopkeeper, who keeps calling her a dirty no-good indian, is a Mestizo.Doubtless I missed some subtleties given the absence of subtitles, and it's probably a better film if you can get all of those. But in generall I recommend this only for Mexican patriots or serious students of film."
4,"filmed in Queen city, Dallas, Texas","Juke Joint with Spencer Williams is a really fun movie, that is if you are not opposed to early black comedies, which I find that many Blacks are. However, I think the reason for that, is that some ignore the historical significance, associated with the production ""Juke Joint"".I found it historically important to the history of a black neighborhood in Dallas, Texas, called ""Queen City"" in southDallas. I found the actual location where the opening sceneswere shot in Dallas, just recently, by paying attention to the film. the ""1241 Pine st. address is no longer in existence."
5,Santa bears first Christmas,"My 16 months old son does not get tired of looking at the bright pictures and plays with the neat toy pop ups! Just a wondeful book that I highly recommend! Wish the authors would publish more books like this, very PLEASED!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Repetitive, pointless...","Mana recorded 2-3 very good albums in their beginnings and thereafter they have continued to rip the glory out of those first great works. Nothing really innovative has come out of them in their most recent productions. ""Revolucion de Amor"" confirms that, plus adds the fact that Fher's voice is no longer what it used to be (or at least doesn't sound as well as before). Not even the presence of some of music's most respected figures, such as Santana and Ruben Blades, save this album from sounding like ""good ole"" Mana, with nothing new to bring to the table. Sorry, Mana fans: you know this is true."
1,"Ya cambienle, ¿no?","Mana va que vuela hacia el decline. Nada de su musica despues de ""sueños liquidos"" me hace ""tilin"" a los oidos. El album viejisimo en donde sale la cancion ""buscandola"", buenisima, y ""rayando el sol"" son clasicas, pero despues de eso, la voz del vocalista harta, la musica es la misma, y la verdad es que todas sus canciones caen en la misma tonada que cansa. Me encantaria que este grupo evolucionara su musica o de plano se desintegrara. El album ""revolucion de amor"" no tiene nada de re-evolucion. Creo que se les subieron los humos al tener tanto exito con sus primeros albumes que se confiaron (ellos mismos declararon que eran el mejor grupo de rock en español y que otros ""tratan"" de igualarlos sin exito) y ya no se esforzaron para mejorar su musica."
2,Not Their Best,"I've been a long time Mana fan and I always pick up their new music. Ever since album's like ""Falta Amor"" and ""Donde Jugaran Los Ninos"" Mana has been running rock en espanol. It's too bad that this album isn't as good as past ones. Although it does have a few good songs, it doesn't seem to have the energy that past records have had. ""Justicia, Tierra, y Libertad"" is probably my favorite, mainly because of energy. When I saw them live in Santa Barbara,CA and in New York City they rocked the house and there wasn't a dull moment for the entire set. When ten year old songs like ""Oye Mi Amor"" are played at Latino clubs people still go crazy. But this album makes me want to go to sleep. There is definitely some musically interesting stuff, but I'm sorry, I want some energy, some rock."
4,Swedish family,My mother's family is all Swedish. This series was very informative and gave me insight into my great grandmother's culture and perhaps some of her shared experiences emmigrating to America.
5,muy livianas y descansadas,"Compre estas gafas para salir al sol de la playa , y para usarlas en el auto al conducir, muy desansada la vista me encantaron , no cansan ni tallan en el area de la nariz ademas que son superlivianas y ni se sienten si se usan por periodos largos, vienen en un estuche muy bueno ademas traen el pañito para limpiarlas, el material del que esta hechas parece fino vamos a ver cuanto me duran."
1,Usher Lite-Lite better call B2k back up,"Omarion is a good dancer&that is the best thing I can say about Him as a Artist. while He was with B2k the other cats covered up his limited vocal range. he gets over on Mid tempo to soem bouncing tracks,but to make this cat have to sing solo is asking too much. I feel Usher is overrated,but He got a Pass because of some catchy songs here&there. but what got Him over don't work for everybody&most of the time what Usher does doesn't do much for me beyond the Entertaining element. Cats not working on there Craft&settling for Fast food material&also Chop Singing&well too rehearsed material that needs more cook than what they are passing off as Steam. Omarion ain't ready to be no Solo Artist."
4,Great Job,"What can i say?,O's debuut album is a great Rnb album i have this album for a long time and it's stil in my cd player i realy like the slow and mid ups songs the ones that people call club bangers on this album doesn't do much with me his voice can't handle that,he is not a great singer but his singing is enough to deliver such a great Rnb album like this,the lycrics are on some songs realy on point you realy can relate yourself to those if youre in the same situation.And what about the beats well sounds like b2k beats and then you know it is good.This guy realy can kick it far as a solo artist he got the skills for it defently with his skilled dance moves.The reason why i give this album 4stars instead of 5stars is because of his singing and the club bangers both borring.But if youre looking for some good Rnb then i advice you this album. Peace"
3,Solo?,"I thought this was going to be his solo CD. When i listened to it I noticed there was always someone else singing the backgrounds with him.I guess he thought he couldn't make it own his own. He isn't the greatest singer, but this is an okay CD so it might be worth buying. He needs to credit the artist singing with him.Everyone knows he likes the spotlight and he kicked aou the old B2K members and trys to blame them for the breakup, but anyone with real brains can see what happened."
3,To Much...,"I Found this record to be alittle to much over did...The Topic were repeated all through out the album sex, I'ma change,sex,Ima change the lyrics were the same to me over and over...Plus he doesn't really have a good voice after listen to the songs acouple of times it gets alittle annoying..But there a a few cut's I Know...In The Dark....I wish... and there are some your going to what to past up Take it off...Drop that Heater....Never gonna let you go...but this leads me to say that there work was really no matter then b2k, he could of did the same thing with the boy band"
5,"Compassionate, easy to read and More Than Helpful!","This book gave me more insight into myself than any other to date! With anecdotes and easy to understand english, Doreen Virtue reminds us to treat ourselves with kindness. Even if you feel anger toward someone (including yourself) who ""did you wrong,"" this book reminds you to let it all go-- don't punish yourself through denial or suppression, or even through hating. This book is everything one might expect from a woman who knows angels!"
2,"Fluff, No Meat","I was disappointed in this. It appeared to be so promising. Instead it was more fluff and nothing all that concrete. I was also quite offended at her saying that rape by a stranger was ""The Ultimate Violation."" Not worth the money."
5,Excellent Read,"Being a Sci-Fi fan from waaaayyyy back, I admit I can be pretty picky sometimes. This book, however, I have no complaints about, except maybe it was too short!! I enjoyed the characters, plot line, descriptive writing, well, the story as a whole.Overall, it is definitely an enjoyable read and I look forward to more installments from this author."
3,Not what I expected,"Like many books I found the advice to be at times obvious. The book is well-organized and probably achieves its goal, but if you're already a competent programmer, it might not add much to your knowledge pool."
4,Smarty Pants,"Listen everybody, is no secret that this song is dedicated to the fuss that the gossip media created around Nick & Jessica's relationship, it's not the first and not the last Nick will do, it must be said although the song lyrics are predictible Mr. Lachey was smart enough to capitalize on his hurt inside & focus on an heartbreak anthem. It's funny that this import single does not offer any dance remix that has been goin' around in the dance radio's or gay clubs (where Mr. Lachey founds a large group of fans of his music and other things). ahhhhhhhhhhh please somebody console him!, I think this smarty pants has a bigger hit in his hands than sleeky Jessica's Public Affair...cos u know all the girls go out on a public affair oh oh oh!"
1,This is an incredibly depressing movie.,"If you want to feel like dirt, watch this movie. This is not a movie about the heroic nature of man. It is about the defeat of the human spirit displayed in a very twisted manner."
1,The WORST movie I've ever seen.,"This has got to be the WORST MOVIE that I've ever seen. Unless you REALLY go for semi-erotic thrillers, skip this unless you really want to see how NOT to make a movie. Had Jeremy Irons skipped this movie, he probably would have become one of the leading actors of the early 90s. I remember going to see this movie simply because it seemed like his career was on the upswing and some friends I ran into recommended we go see it instead of the cheesy comedy we were going to see. What a waste. Some people on internet boards seem to like it, but most everyone I've ever talked to face to face that has seen this has hated it. This is one of those times I wish Amazon had a negative star rating system. AVOID AVOID AVOID."
3,Not A Horror Movie,"Decided to watch this after finding it on a ""The 100 Greatest Horror Movies of all time"" list. Not a bad movie, but it is most definitely not a horror film."
4,Brilliant film!,"This film really places David Cronenberg as one of the best, if not the premier, filmmakers of the ""body horror"" genre. His interpretation of the dual psyche of the Mantle Twins goes from soberly sinister to frenetically gorey. I was left baffled as to which is which, caused by the development of the Twins' characters. Jeremy Irons, as usual, delivered another tour-de-force of a performance with his audience-confusing portrayal of the virile Elliot and the gentle Beverly. The surgical tools designed by Peter Grundy reflect the grisly state of mind of the Twins. Overall, a great film, except for some scenes where the Twins were together, where either of them would appear a little bit transluscent and the background showing from the back through the face or the hands. It's good that Cronenberg gave the title ""Twins"" to director Ivan Reitman; this could have given the movie an impressionable twist."
3,Fair,"This should have been left with the same version as on tv. There were alot of chapters cut out. Though, it was good novela."
1,Bundle Kit,THIS STUFF IS TOTALLY DOLLAR STORE STUFF!!!! NOT WHAT I EXPECTED BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
4,Nice bag. Perfect for Little Leagers,"The bag fits all of my son's baseball gear. I got one for him and one for my nephew, they both love them. Perfect Little League bag."
4,Warning: Extreme Volume!,"I've been a big fan of Racer X since the 80's, love the band. Both albums are a must have for the Racer X fan. If you're a guitarist and have never heard Racer X, you have to check them out. Paul Gilbert and Bruce Bouliet are awesome guitarists. How do you describe Racer X? The best way is guitar rock, solos are technical and fast. I wouldn't consider them ""heavy"" just rock. Racer X live is as good as in the studio."
4,Too Realistic?,"The ordinaryness of the possibility of being frozen to death is the real tension in the book, reminiscent of Jack London's ""To Build A Fire."" Like that classic, this will you make shiver in bed at night, even if you live in San Diego. The unspoken moral choices and community judgment set this firmly in South Dakota, not Alaska. Note that I said too realistic: South Dakotans tend to see outsiders as cartoon characters, much as coasties view South Dakotans (""I blame Fargo"" says Tory), so the criminals' cardboard characters may simply reflect the townies' view of them. The puns and literary references are great fun, but they also tweak the reader's suspension of disbelief. My wife and I adore the series, but this one is very literary, which is why only 4 stars."
5,Surprised,"I remember the flap of years ago, relating to a one time only hit for Billy Ray. I don't follow Country music real close, but my daughter's fascination with Miley brought me to purchase this CD and I really enjoy his voice. This man puts his heart into his songs."
5,"Billy Ray Cyrus ""Home At Last""",I bought this CD because my daughter heard Billy's new song on the Disney channel. Of course years ago I listened to him a little but wasn't much into his music. Believe me I have changed my mind. I love his new CD. It's well worth the money and I intend to purchase another one for my granddaughter. He's grown not only in his music but in his maturity. From all that I've read and seen about him - he's genuine.
5,GREAT SELLER!,"I RECEIVED THIS QUICKLY AND IT WAS EXACTLY AS THE SELLER DESCRIBED. I AM PLEASE ALL AROUND. I GOT A GREAT CD AT A FANTASTIC PRICE, LOW POSTAGE COSTS, & FAST SHIPPING. YOU CAN NOT ASK FOR MORE THAN THAT!"
3,Home At Last,"This is a pleasant CD, but there's not much that's memorable on it except the song about his daughter leaving home. He does a nice job on Over the Rainbow, also."
3,Revision work,"I agree with another reviewer that this should be called ""revising"" rather than writing. The excercises are interesting and thought-provoking, but (and this would go for any book that claims to teach you how to write a novel) do not use this unless you have a complete first draft of your novel. Using this before you have all your ideas and plans written down may very well hinder your progress because you get so wrapped up in editing and revising.So, don't be misled by the title of this book or most other how to writing books. Use them only after you are complete with a first draft, otherwise you may never get that first draft done."
2,Boring and unconvincing,"I bought this book based on the many great reviews here. I was very disappointed. After the first 500 pages, I couldn't read anymore (very unlike me!) - the story was going nowhere - how many times can I read about a banquet! The dialogue between the characters was way too ""20th century"" & completely unconvincing."
5,Very Good,"I am a 14 year old, and I find this book to be one of the most wonderfully written books I have ever read. It is one of my personal favorites.It tells about the life of Queen Cleopatra VII. It tells about her victories and defeats, about the trouble she faced, all she went throught to become what she was. If you like reading about Cleopatra, this is one you have to read."
4,Memoirs of Cleopatra,When I saw this book on the shelves of my school library I was debating on whether should read it. (It was after all 964 pages). I had of course heard of Queen Cleopatra but I never really knew about her life and was curious to learn about it. And so I checked out the book and began to read. From the moment I finished the first page I was hooked. I was very surprised at the amount of research that the author had done to write this book. From the beginning to the end Memoirs of Cleopatra is an absolutely wonderful book that gives readers a glimpse into Queen Cleopatra's life.
3,"asi, asi","I too am ""only 13"" but I would not like to praise the book. Sure the eloquence and knowlage of M. George is enough to make Isis breathe in awe, but it got to be a little too much. I felt like I was reading a textbook and the book seemed so impersonal. A little too much was put into this book."
5,Fascinating Read,"Long book but it kept me hooked from beginning to end. It might have been long, but it didn't have a single slow or drawn out part. Completely fascinating way to look at the life of Cleopatra. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good, entertaining, educational (well-researched) read."
2,Too easy to put down,"The young Egyptian princess grows up at a dangerous court headed first by her gentle drunk father and later by her two usurping older sisters. When she becomes queen after her father's death, she must fight the regency council of her young brother and future husband.I have to admit my heart sank when I saw the size of this book. I don't have anything against long novels per se, but it is my sad experience that very few authors can maintain an interesting storyline for a normal-length book, much less a massive monster. Then there were a lot of small incongruities that contributed to a jarring effect, such as addressing Cleopatra's pharaoh-father as ""King"" and referring to her family as ""the Ptolemies."" Everything I've read on ancient Egypt showed a vast cleft between the god-kings and those who served them. I managed to wade through the first hundred pages, but between the little inaccuracies and lack of a compelling storyline, I gave up."
5,Wow. all I Can Say Is Wow.,"Many other reviewers have posted here explaining the outline of this story, so I won't bore you with the same details. But suffice it to say that as someone who is loathe to get through heavy books (and this is a seriously heavy looking book), I found this to be refreshing. The writing is beautiful, the characters well-rounded, and the author brings ancient Alexandria to life in a way that makes this book simply fly by. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in history, particularly ancient Roman or Egyptian life."
4,Surprise! It held my attention for 800 pages!,"This book was a very good value. When I received it, I was alarmed at how long it was - I wouldn't have bought it in the bookstore as it is big, thick and heavy. Nevertheless, I began it and was immediately ""into"" the story. It was engrossing and ""felt"" like non-fiction in the amount of detail, dialogue, and interesting characters. This book really cemented my new interest in ""things Egyptian"" -- this interest started in my recent readings of Christian Jacq's series on the kings of Egypt. Also, now I want to see the Liz Taylor / Richard Burton movie about Antony and Cleopatra. Summary: outstanding, engrossing read. Try it even if you shy away from books over 300 pages long! You will surprise yourself."
3,Cleopatra holidays and romps through history,"Cleopatra is one of the myths and realities of the ancient world. She was the ruler, in her own right, of Egypt and seduced 2 of the greatest roman rulers of her age.Margaret Geroge gives and impressive re-creation of a lost world in this novel. She also gives a lively characterisation to Cleopatra. That said, however, the book is long, and I found myself drifting, and I never finished it. I'm not quite sure what is wrong with this novel.The author is gifted, but I suspect this is like one of those long movies that goes on just that little bit too long and destroys what would otherwise be an amazing outing."
3,"Way, way too long...should have been three separate books","I read this on my Kindle and midway through the book called Amazon to complain about the overwhelming errors on almost every page. This might have been tolerable had the book not droned on for hundreds of pages. I love Harris's books about Cicero (Imperium and Conspirata) because of the richness and ultimate concise text. This could have been similiar but at almost 1,000 pages I gave up on the last 250 and skimmed the remaining story. I'm glad to see Amazon pulled the Kindle edition and hope that other books get a better reading before being offered to readers. I wanted to like this book but just can't recommend it."
5,Entrancing,"Amazing and detailed book about the story of Cleopatra from a first person point of view in the form of a ""diary"". George did an admirable job of weaving an entertaining fictional story while sticking to confirmed facts about Cleopatra's life. It fascinated me as a teenager and made me inclined to read anything I could get my hands on about Cleopatra, the last Queen of the Nile. By far the best book about her that I've read in the last 15 years."
2,Disappointing,"Margaret George is a wonderful researcher and there is no denying that, however, did she have to throw every single bit she dug up into the book?The story of the young Cleopatra was fascinating. I liked the little girl that Cleopatra was and how she had to grow up real quick. I couldn't stand the older Cleopatra.The the first few hundred pages were worth reading, but not the rest. I put this book down several times only returning because I hate leave books half read."
3,only so-so,I bought this book because I love Cleopatra & her story. Unfortunately it was not all I was hoping for. Don't get me wrong there are some parts that are extremely exhilirating but in between those moments the story line moves really slow. It got to the point that I finished the book not because of the story but simply because it's so thick I wanted to be able to say I finished a book that was more than a thousand pages long.
4,Great Tale,"I really enjoyed this book, but was I distracted by one repeated inaccuracy. The author places Cleopatra frequently within the Roman pomerium--a place where no sovereign monarch was permitted. It threw me off, but as always, I enjoyed Margaret George's wonderful writing."
3,George turns Egypt's Fabled Queen Into A Cardboard Cut Out,"I read and enjoyed Margaret George's Autobiograpy of Henry the VIII, and liked how she made Henry into a very real character. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed in her treatment of Cleopatra. As a character, her actions were predictable and almost devoid of any sort of feeling or emotion. I found myself comparing this work with William Bostock's ""I Cleopatra"", and for all its faults, Bostock's work far exceeded George's in terms of characterizations, flow, and historical accuracy. Im sorry, I would like to rate this work higher, but in all good conscience cannot."
2,"Kind of easy, pretty boring","I bought this video at a discount book store and was excited to see a new Method DVD. I like variety and consider myself an advanced exerciser. I did it once, didn't sweat and was BORED! It has been gathering dust ever since."
3,Buy the Frame Seperate!!!,"Poster = great. Frame, fragile, but functional. The big catch is the shipping costs. I paid >$100 for this and another 11""X14"" framed poster...and their not shipped in frame!You must put the poster in the frame yourself. You're better off going to a local K-mart, Target, Walmart or professional frame store and getting an equitable or better product for the same price.Bottom line...nice product, overpriced."
4,Oldie but a Goodie,"Rhodes covers the war in a very succinct, no nonsense manner. Writing style is somewhat dated, but completely understandable. It's advertised as being illustrated, but there are fewer pictures than I would have liked. Still, it's a good bargain for the amateur historian that wants a refresher on the Civil War."
3,Only a fair blade--there are better,"I give this blade 3 stars because it does an OK job, and is certainly better than some blades out there. And for some shavers, it is an excellent blade, so if this is your go-to blade don't be put off by my comments. But the truth is, there are a few other blades out there that will work better in your Merkur razor than the stock Merkur blade. Blades such as Personnas, Derbys (also sold on Amazon), Gillettes, and Feathers will generally do a better job in a Merkur. I only post this info because I own several Merkurs and have never found the Merkur blade to yield a good shave. YMMV, of course."
4,Decent shave,I bought these when I first purchased my saftey razor. I have since purchased one of the sample packs that include several brands of blades and have found some that work better (for a more reasonable price). I would recommend going that route instead of spending your money on one brand.
2,Not sharp enough,These blades are a little too mild for my taste. My facial hair is on the thicker side so when I made a pass with the Merkur blade I could feel it tugging away. I had to make multiple passes in order to get my face nice and smooth. The result of these multiple passes was horrible road rash and a quite a bit of blood. Stepped over to Feather blades and they work like butter.
5,"Down the road, not across the street",These things are sharp and are great for a safety razor. I wouldn't recommend them for suicide though because they are pretty flimsy when not in a holding apparatus.
4,Great classic shave.,"I started shaving with a safety razor a few months ago. These Merkur blades come in a nice spring loaded dispenser, which makes them harder to lose. They provide a nice shave, and haven't nicked me too much. They are very thin, and I would purchase this brand again."
2,This book is about twice the size it needs to be.,"I bought this book to get info on the various Linux certifications that are available... I NEEDED that information right now, and the book delivered - Particularly by using the companion website... but this book could have been half the size ( and presumably, half the price) the information of exam cramming techniqies etc is avaialble elsewhere and quite unnecessary.I suspect that this book will date quite rapidly... its a read once and give to a library type book... you wont refer to it again..."
5,Sixwire is Awesome !!!!,I love the cd!!! Sixwire it awesome.... Now I'm waiting on the guys to do another cd because I will have this wore out till then.Keep us the great work guys!!!
3,Monitor de emergencia,"La resolucion que muestra el monitor es muy baja y solo puede ser de ayuda cuando tenemos alguna reparacion de equipos, en mi caso, por lo regular solo manejo laptop pero cuando necesito conectar una desktop este es buen producto para solo arreglar el equipo y dejar la configuracion del equipo, no para un uso extensivo."
2,"A little too ""ghetto""","I'm a low low low budget filmmaker. But some of the things this book encourages it just too ghetto and will just result in poor quality films. I bought this used for next to nothing but the real thing it would cost you is time, as in this is honestly kind of a waste of time."
1,How to Make DV Movies at Used Car Prices...That No One Will Want to See,"I was excited about this book but then when I got it and read the first few pages, I was disappointed, big time.The author is, I think, some liberal arts professor who goes on and on about how to make a movie in less than 19 days. He recommends all sorts of off-the-cuff methods, like not using a script.OK, dude, people have been making movies like that for decades -- they're called home movies. And guess what -- no one but the person who filmed it likes home movies.He gives lots of outdated advice like how to share your movie on ""low cost"" file sharing servers that just point back to your home computer and eat up your bandwidth allowance from your ISP in no time flat. He goes on and on about how great Apple is...buy an Apple...buy an Apple...buy the $1,000 Adobe editing suite...wow, this is becoming one expensive used car!"
1,"Good God, buy an Yngwie album instead","This guy fails at trying to make a living of a quote Yngwie Malmsten said, giving praise to this guy.Byrd's much repeated ""parallel evulution"" theory about how he just happens to sound like Yngwie fails miserably when you hear the actual similarity. It's too uncanny to be coincidental.I don't know what's worse, the sound or the songs. Buy an Yngwie or Vinnie Moore album instead!"
4,A Youngster With Taste and Skill To Boot,"Picked this up the other day, had heard the other two releases so I knew it would be good. Although the Shrapnel label is reknown for its fleet-fingered young discoveries, I find Micheal Lee to be the tastiest of the bunch. This cd shows his writing abilities to be in top form not just providing rhythms to play scorching solos over. He has a ""faux"" slide technique I find really intriguing,""how the hell does he do that without a slide?"" This kid has it going on and seems to go unnoticed by the mainstream press. Definitely worth a listen.."
3,Good Summary,"This book is basically a huge summary of all the Urban Design books writen in the past 100 years. Its nice to have it all in one place, the book is organized well and is a great reference to have in any professional library."
4,"Nice, but Dilbert engineering","This system sounds very good, but:1. They come with only 5 feet of cable between the right and left speakers!! C'mon give us 10-12 feet in case we're putting them in a bedroom. I added some speaker wire for my bedroom and presentations.2. Putting a carrying handle on the bass speaker would be another improvement."
5,Amazing Speakers,These little speakers are powerful and full of amazing sound. A great deal for under 50 dollars!Couldn't sound any better.....
5,An excellent value,"For the price, you can't beat this system. It does exactly what I needed it to do, which is providing sound when my laptop is on the desk. The speakers are good-looking and let you control the bass boost from the desktop speaker. The including gaming patch cord was nice (although I don't need it) and these speakers also provide a headphone jack. Amazon/[...] beat the price offered by [...] and shipping was prompt. Very glad I made this purchase."
3,Cyber Acoustics 2.1 computer speakers,"disappointed somewhat with these speakers. they perform very well until the bass goes up to high. the sub has bass reflex (makes a nice little blast of wind) but the distortion is very annoying. this system would be good for personal uses like computer gaming and music, but don't expect the room to shake before the sub does. the satellites are very good as well, and the gaming adapter makes it useful for people who do not have an audio output on their televisions. recommended for the money, but be aware of the performance."
4,good sound at a good price,"This system is really good. I had tried several others for about the same price, but those others had weak and/or muddy bass and/or un-natural higs/mids. I have an older set of this same model and have been very happy them for years. I have experience in live sound engineering so I am particluar about how my music sounds. This set (CA 3550WB) gives good, clear, natural sound, with strong clean bass and decent highs. I really like the two volume controls - one for bass, one for over-all volume. The wires between the satellites are not too long (you can place them about 4 feet apart) but they are made for a desk-top environment, not a theatre. I am happy with them as is, playing them direct from either my PC or MP3. I am sure that with even a simple EQ system which many computers have somewhere in their systems they could sound even better - though they sound good without the EQ. I highly recommend them."
1,"The number of errors makes it nearly useless at best, confusing at worst.","It's true. It is full of mistakes. I quit after the first chapter in frustration over the errors. McGraw Hill does not offer an errata for the book. Shame on you McGraw Hill. Either quit selling it, or give us a comprehensive errata so we may fix our already purchased copies. I will be very slow to trust all future books by this publishing company."
2,Not very well written,"The author seems confident in his abilities.So confident that he leaves out steps in arriving atcertain solutions in the early part of the book.This is ok after you have grasped the material bygoing over simpler examples first. The flow is wrong in the beginning of the book. I can see how this would frustrate most people refreshing theirmath skills.My college level book was easier to get into than this""DeMystified"" publication.I am very dissapointed and wish I could get my money back."
1,DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Do not buy. This camera has very little real value.It privides USELESS EDITING support.The bundled software ( Pixela Image Mixer) SUCKS big time. There is no way to get your movies off the camera except using this software. If you happen to lose or scratch the software cd, you have to BUY IT AGAIN @ $40.I'm wasting a little bit of my life by writing this review because i happen to be one frustrated owner of this product - Sony DCR DVD-201.Here are two conversations I had with Sony customer support after I lost my software CD:[...]"
3,Not great Yoga instruction....,"...but very nice if you like watching an attractive nude female (no silicon implants). This is a low budget production, but I think it is worth the price from an aesthetic viewpoint."
3,Worth having,"There are a couple of really cute patterns in this one (and a couple that are real daggy), it is hard to find patterns sized for Teens (Tweens), patterns seem to go from Baby, toddler, Adult. So this book is worth while to have even for the sizing, I haven't knitted any yet. My daughter (the tween), likes the one on the cover with the flowers, a little skirt with matching top, and I like the simple lace cardi."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to this album, but was disappointed. The music has this feel to it, like it's being spoken more than sung. There is little emotion to be heard in Stacia's voice. The only song I like on this album is ""Little Girl"" and that's mostly for the words...the song itself, like the others, has no emotion and therefore feels like it's plodding along. I don't intend to insult her or her fans, but if you're looking for a great new pop artist to listen to, pass on this album."
3,"Slow-Paced, But Original","This story plot was unlike any book I've ever read for teens. Although definitley original and creative, this book lacked the drawing-in of it's readers.It didn't have the stability to keep the mystery of Paul's brother actually MYSTERIOUS. I, unfortunatley, am not a huge sports fan, so I basically skipped through all of the droning, detailed soccer games. All in all, this book lacked consistency. I reccommend this book to intellectual sports fans who like slow-paced (basically pointless) books."
2,A Review of Tangerine for Teachers.,"I enjoyed reading this book with my class. The students enjoyed talking about Paul and how he handled some tense situations. The author portrayed Paul as a person who wanted to have a normal school life, normal friends. He wanted a family who was open and honest with each other. In the end this process was happening for him because he made it happen. The suspense and surprises made this book enjoyable and hard to put down for my students. I would recommend this book."
2,Tangerine,"Tangerine is an ""interesting"" book that shows the troubles of a legally blind boy. Paul and family move to Tangerine, Florida. His brother, Eric, tortures him. It was a mystery how he became blind. His school gets sucked into a sinkhole and then goes to a new school. Read about his troubles and good times.I didn't like this book because the plot didn't catch me. The characters were sometimes hard to believe but sometimes interesting. If you were looking to read a diary I would rather read the Diary of Anne Frank than this book. This book is for people who read half diaries, half novels."
1,Pathetically boring,"""Tangerine"" had quite some potential for an interesting plot, but an attempt by Edward Bloor to intertwine many plots together completely failed. To make things even more boring, writing format is nothing out of the ordinary and seems to have been written by a third-grader. In other words, the writing style in ""Tangerine"" will set you to sleep.Character development is ridiculously non-evident. Setting descriptions are poor. Characters are described in a way so that a reader feels no sympathy. In fact, you may find yourself reading words instead of soaking in a nice story. The plot is unbearably ridiculous and you will NEVER find yourself turning a page in high anticipation of what is to happen. This book is not worth your time. Don't even bother~ especially if ""Tangerine"" is on your optional summer reading list."
3,Tangerine,"The main characters in this book is Paul Fisher and his older brother Erik Fisher.Both of the brothers want to go pro, Paul in soccer and Erik in football.But the parents pay more attention to Erik's dream because Paul is legally blind and his parents dont think he will go as far as Erik. Even though Paul can't see that well he can see that his brother Erik is very evil. And he trys to get everyone else to see. A lot of strange stuff happens in Tangerine FL and Paul trys to figure it out like: What really happened to my eyesight? Why is Erik so evil? Why do lighting strike the same place every day? I really didn't like the book, but if you like mysteries,soccer, football and a lot of action. I recommend this book to you."
4,Tangerine,"Katie ChoContemporary/ Realistic fictionTangerineEdward Bloor7th-9th GradeWhen the Fishers moved from Houston, Texas to Tangerine, Florida, Paul was faced with new obstacles and had to adjust to life there. From switching schools from Lake Windsor to Tangerine Middle and meeting new people, Paul finally discovers the truth about his near blindness and about Erik, his brother.I enjoyed reading this book because the author included suspense and point of view. The way he illustrated these scenes in Tangerine kept me intrigued and I never wanted to put the book down, from beginning to end. Edward Bloor has a talent of creating lines of beautiful language.The possible classroom uses for this book are for projects, group activities, and independent study."
4,Tangerine:The Review-A twelveyr. old,"Tangerine.I would give this book four stars because,it's a all around good book.Paul Fisher is the main charcater who moves from TX to Tangerine FL.He goes to a new school ,Lake Windsor Downs,and makes some new friends.Then theres a problem so he has to go to Tangerine Middlehas gangs & every thing.Paul gets on their soccer team & makes some new friends,the War Eagles.More things happen later on in the book,but you have to read it to find out. :) (:"
3,"Tangerine Review, Jeremy Hahn 13 years old","I rate this book 3 out of 5 stars. This book is really good because of all of the events that take place. Paul the narrator plays on a great soccer team, but it took a hard time to get on it. He has to meet new friends who he gets along with pretty well.Erik, his brother, has a football dream. He wants to get into a good colledge.Erik gets into trouble and everything falls about.The place they moved to has storms everyday at the same time; along with a lot of citrus groves. The thing i didn't like about this book was that it didn't give a lot of detail at tyhe ending.This is why i rated the book 3 stars. You should read this book if u like a book that is mysterious."
4,Fisher Man,"12-year-old Paul Fisher has just moved to a new county; Lake Windsor Downs. There's muck fires all the time, lighting storms everyday, but Paul's ok with it.Paul met this new guy Joey at school. Suddenly something happens at school and it makes him have to change schools. This will change Paul alot. But his parents will never notice caught up in the Erik Fisher Football Dream. This book is filled with action, comedy, and drama. I would recommend anyone to read this book."
5,BASEBALL B,"Paul Fisher moved with his family to Tangerine County, Florida. In Tangerin, there are muck fires, sinkholes, mosquitoes, ospreythat stealing koi, and lighting that strikes every day at the same time. Koi is a fish. Paul has very thick eyed glasses. Paul likes this girl name Kari, but he is shy to talk to her. His brother Erik plays football. Pauls dad dosen't care about Paul at all. His dad calles it, ""The Erik Fisher football dream."" There was a sinkhole at Pauls new school, Lake Windsor Downs. The pincipal decided if you wanter to got to Tangerine Middle or switch schedule. He chose Tangerine Middle."
4,The Orange Review,"In this epic suspense thrilling story a visualy impaired goal-tender named paul moves from Huston,TX to Tangerine,FL where underground fires never stop burning and lightning strikes the same football feild everyday. As Paul lives his life he discovers strange events and tries to remember why he wears the thick bottle cap glasses on his head. His football star brother seems to be hanging out with the wrong gang and discovers his own dangerous past.This book was a good book because it had suspense and made you not want to stop reading. This book made me interested in it because of the football sport."
5,This should have won an award last year.,"Bloor, a new name in YA, has written a wonderful story about a handicapped boy who is struggling with his disability, trying to compete to be recognized like his brother is recognized in the eyes of his father and this boy's emotional trauma that he suffered at the hands of his brother. I just thought that this was a refreshing tale that I could not put down. It's got the mystery quality and sports theme that will appeal to most YA boys. It is in my middle school library and it isoften signed out."
3,"Same book, different cover.","I was very excited to buy this book, since I had to read it for 7th grade pre-AP, so I ordered it online from Amazon like I normally would. But when this book came in the mail I opened up the package and the book wasn't what the picture showed online. It's the same book, don't get me wrong, but the cover is the normal orange cover. Same book, different cover. :/"
4,Tre'Gia Dunn,"Tangerine is a great book I recommend it to all ages.This book ios about a boy named Paul who is legally blind, his parents and his older brother Eric. They moved to Tangerine County from Houston,Texas. Throughout this book Paul tries to figure out how he became legally bling. His whole life he is told that he stared at a solar eclipse and that's how he lost his sigt.One day Paul loses his school portables to a large sinkhole. Because of this Paul begins to attend Tangerine Middle School, where he meets a totally new crowd. During his time that he attends Tangerine strange things start to happen in the community such as missing fish,robberies,and even [a life being ended].that's all the information IU can inclose. To find out more you have to read the book."
3,Jay T.,This book is about a boy named Paul Fisher.He moved to Tangerine when he was 12 years old.He goes to Lake Windsor Middle scool until it sunk into a sink hole.Then Paul joined Tangerine Middle school.Paul is on the Tangerine soccer team.His brother Erik plays on the Lake Windsor football team.His dad only cares about Eriks football dream and he knows nothing about pauls soccer team.Paul meets new friends on his soccer team.One of his good friends die.This is a good book to read.
3,An odd account of a misfit,"paul fisher is legally blind- from looking at an eclipse! The Fisher family moves to tangerine, fL. and something seems odd. and erik, paul's older brother, has been acting stranger and meaner than ever- even though paul's the only one to notice.HERE'S A PLOT SUMMARY FOR SCHOOL: Paul Fisher, a ""geek,"" moves to Tangerine, Florida with his family. He is legally blind and has never fit in. Paul plays soccer and is on the school team- the toughest group around. But something odd is going on in Tangerine County, so read this book to find out what!"
1,Edward Bloor Blows it Major,"Bloor has a very hard time getting his characters developed, and he has too many problems which make the story very confusing. Although a story doesn't neccesarily NEED a climax, this book has so many little climaxes it almost becomes predictible. . . Theme is not well developed and unclear (in my opinon.) Bloor does a very good job of keeping the story exactly the way you would have imagined it. Read this book and you'll see what I mean. . ."
2,Fisher Man,"Paul Fisher, AKA Fisher Man, has a not so normal life. Living on top of muck fires and in a termite-infested house with a brother that has everything a child could want, he turned out pretty normal. In the book Tangerine by Edward Bloor, Paul finds a way of life in Tangerine County.I thought Paul's life was not very realistic because there was too much going on at once. His best friend's brother died, his school started melting into a sinkhole, and he gets bullied by everyone. This book needs to have more focus to it other than bullying. How could one kid get beat up by his brother and get teased by the almost the whole county without his parents knowing anything?I have to say it had great detail but I would only recommend it to readers that like soccer and for those who like intense stories."
1,Too disturbing for many readers,"This book contains very disturbing scenes of violence between family members. Kids like books that deal with sibling problems, because most kids experience those problems themselves. They may identify with the younger brother in this book, and then be horrified by the physical torture and permanent damage his brother inflicts on him. This book gave me nightmares."
1,Tangerine,"Tangerine, was not what i expected from the title.The genre was contemporary realistic fiction. The story was what i call 'garbage'. There were many stories by him but this was not very interesting because it was about a boy named Paul who is blind from unknown reasons. His brother Erik who is the jock in the family. Paul moves from his home in Texas to florida, in a town called Tangerine. When he goes to school there he is very much not enjoying him self because his brother gets all the attention because he's a foot ball star. But there are many strange happenings that go on around the town. In my opinon this book was to boring to read. I don't think that this book is recommended to someone else. That's all."
5,Awesome Book!,"As a 7th grade challange block Student, I would have to syathat Tangerine is one one of the BEST books I've ever read! InfactTangerine is the BEST coming of age book I've ever read! Paul Fisher is quite a character, and quite a brother. I loved this book it's was exciting and funny it kept me wantingto read more and more! I would reccomend this book to any middle schooler. It is definetely a five star book! Two words ""Read it! """
4,Katie's Review on Tangerine,This book was very interesting. I liked this Book because something was always happening.this book is a Happy and sad book. I Reccomend this book to anyone who likes a book that never gets boring.
4,Really Great Book!,"When Paul Fisher moves to Tangerine county, Florida, he realizes that things are not as serene as they seem. Due to an illegal money saving maneuver, part of the school that Paul goes to is swallowed by a sinkhole. When Paul changes schools because of it, he finds that he fits in to the soccer team. Between soccer practice, homework and saving tangerine groves, Paul remembers the past and puzzles with the present. Paul also discovers the truth about his older brother, Erik, the high school football star.The author does a great job showing you Paul's world through his thick glasses, which he wears because of an accident when he was five. Paul finds out why he wears them in this great book."
2,Fluffy bunnies much?,"Wicca, the Complete Craft as written by D.J. Conway is an interesting book, to say the least. If you are new to Wiccan studies and instruction books, please pick up a copy ofWicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner (Includes Author's Book of Shadows). There you will discover a much better and more accurate look at history as well as a less biased look at the role that the God and Goddess play.She has reduced the God to little more than a good lay for the Goddess, which is completely inaccurate. Her feminism would do well to duck its head when she works on an instructional text, to say the least.It is however, a handy reference material, offering nicely presented correspondence lists as well as alphabets in the back. To tell the truth, with the slim pickings of books in my area, it was a nice buy only to get the compilation of information in the back."
3,A few classics but more than a few worthless cuts,Buffalo Gals and He's lookin' like a Hobo are definite Hall of Famers as well as Hey DJ (won't you play that song) are by themselves worth the cost of the overall cd but there's too many cuts here that are pretty boring both musically and lyrically.Worth the purchase price but only for a few CLASSIC cuts.
4,Jack's back!!,"Please, tell me you've been keeping up with all the books in the Amibient series! If you haven't you're just going to have to hurry to catch up with the rest of us.This is a world as unlike ours as it is a carbon-copy. The year is 1968, but it's not the same 1968 you remember (or read about, youngsters.)Walter Bullitt is just another luckless schmoe, trying to survive without having to try too hard. Sure, he's had a good career being a pharmaceutical guinea pig for the government and taking on the occasional assignment. But, this is a job offer he desperately wants to turn down. Too bad things don't work that way.Follow Bullitt on a wild, psychedelic ride through the club scene, encounters with the afterlife, and maybe some brushes with another time. Womack's vision is unlike anyone else's and you don't want to miss your chance to hop on the sometimes deadly conga line."
1,"Tsk Tsk, what a shame...",My name is Whitney and I have three words to describe the book. Waste of time. This book was by far the worst piece of literature that I have ever read. The dialog was well written but the descriptions went on forever and half the time was using 1960/70s lingo and not being from that era made it rather difficult to decode. I would not recommend this book to anyone and I advise you to pick another.
4,"Strange, Dark, Unorthodox..... But Great","This album is one of the most compelling albums I ever heard in my life. This album has more versitile- It has the track fearturing Korn. The song ""War and Peace"" contained a sample called ""Don't Speak"" by G. Stephani. Also this album contains the eerie track called the ""Pecking Order"". In my opinion the albums best songs were ""Dr. Frankenstein, ""Greed"", ""War and Peace"", and ""Penitentiary"". Althought this album has many songs affilited with alternative music, Cube keeps it gangsta, but also more concerned about getting his money."
2,"A great record for a new emcee, but Cube should know better","What happened to Ice Cube's angry style? It has disappeared totally. Cube now sounds like a parody of himself. His lyrics are tight, but nothing like AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted or Death Certificate.I got a lot of respect for Ice Cube. The old Ice Cube that is. If this was his debut album, maybe my opinion on it would've changed but he should know better. The CD is only okay. Cube fans will be disappointed. I hope The Peace Disc will be better."
5,Traditional Medicinals Gypsy Cold Care Herbal Tea,"When you are really sick, it is so soothing, and tastes yummy. Used it once, and bought a bulk load for future maladies."
4,Music before its time,"Amazing that something like this didn't get more public attention. Could be that it was just a matter of 'bad timing'. The release of this material was at the same time as the Seattle invasion, with Nirvana's Nevermind release, Pearl Jam's 10 release, then there was Soundgarden and Stone Temple Pilots' releases, etc...would have been a tough shadow for a debut album from a no-name band from Texas. Too bad that this fizzled out before it blew up. It coulda been cool..."
3,good but..,"I only liked Skiba's songs. I'm not a big fan of Kevin Seconds' songs on this album. He's a cool guy but I just couldn't get into his songs. If you're an Alkaline Trio fan you'll like Skiba's songs too. This isn't the greatest split but it's worth picking up. One little problem I had with this cd was that it sounded way over produced for an acoustic album. I like when acoustic songs sound live, and when you listen to this cd you can definatly tell it's produced by professionals."
4,okish,i like the cage. itsdefinitely not a sugar glider cage ora ferret cage. butit can be altered for gliders just by purchasing some hardware cloth and zip ties from the local home depot or lowes. i think it costed me 30 bucks. but no big deal. a lot bigger in person but plenty of room for my sugar gliders to jump around and be happy in. although upon opening the box a small piece of the wiring of the cage had broken but the hardware cloth and zip ties took care of that! overall pretty good cage size wise and looks really cool after you put it together. very easy and quick set up.
4,Good overall....,"I have two issues with this product...putting the ""slide"" together was a little tough because it came in 4 pieces and they lock in place. If you put it together...say backwards...the little pieces break off if you try to pull it apart.My other issue was the doors...there are 3 one on the lower level front, one on the upper level front and a large door on the top that folds in half and is supported by 3 ""clasps"" that click into the cage. I haven't gotten the ferrets yet, but they are smart animals and can escape easily from these types of doors so you will have to get small carribiners or something like that to secure them closed....even then they can push out of the middle part of the top door.Overall, a good cage."
3,This is for the set up,"I just got my cage yesterday. I haven't gotten the ferret yet, but the set up is a pain in the butt. The instructions aren't well put together so I had to figure it out myself. Some of the parts are really cheap,so you have to be careful when you are snapping the parts together.overall its seems like a realy good starter cage especially for the price. It was a lot bigger than expected and it comes with a name tag for your ferret which is pretty cool."
3,Its okay for temporary but not for long time use,"basically what my title says, if you own ferrets i suggest you look into buying a Ferret Nation Cage from ferret.com (cheaper)this super pet cage the green tunnels break to easily and this cage is so hard to clean."
5,Wonderful cage for mature Rats!,"We have 2 Dumbo rats and a fancy rat in this cage and it works great! Note that a baby or small rat may squeeze through the bars in certain places, so wait until full grown to put in this cage."
2,Missing parts,"The cage itself is nice, and would be perfect for my ferret. However the package was missing most of the pieces. The sides and pan and shelves were the only thing in the package, no accessories. So we have a stationary cage (no wheels) with no way for the ferret to travel between the levels except to climb the sides and nowhere to sleep. Very disappointed."
5,Great for the $$$$,"Great cage for the money. I have no complaints. It is actually a little better than I pictured when I saw the price. If you want a good cage at a good price this is it, if you want a really nice cage, keep looking and prepare to spend 2-3 times the money."
5,Easy to follow,I thought this tape was easy to follow and I like that it can go from beginner to advanced just by increasing the weights. I've been using it daily since I got it which is incredible for me! ( :
1,"Dangerous,Jerky Moves",I do not like Kelly Coffey-Meyer's style at all. She never smiles and always seem to have mean look on her face like she's trying to act tough. Her moves are jerky and looks dangerous to me....especially for someone who hasn't worked out in a while or middle-aged like me. I returned this for a refund.
4,"Magnificent, but too brief","Is there anything quite like the sound of a church choir singing time-honored hymns at Christmas? The San Francisco Chancel Choir uplifts and inspires with their warm, sweet, and haunting harmonies. The only instrument (other than human voice) is a church organ, which adds to the mystical effect of the album. Beloved familiar hymns like ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing"" are blended with those that are less well-known.They manage to fit 25 hymns into this album, but at the expense of the original music. In most selections, only one or two verses of the hymn are sung, equating to about a minute and a half per selection. But this album is bargain-priced and, if you enjoy singing and rejoicing in church, be assured that this CD deserves a spot in your CD player all through the Christmas season."
2,"I got what I ""paid"" for","It was free, so I can't complain too much.The writing is very old, and I think something got lost in the translation. I haven't read any other or more recent editions, but this one was more notes and explanation by volume than original text.If you're seriously interested in the mythology, then I would suggest another edition. I was a little shocked when the notes started out with Adam and Even and gave a hasty summary of biblical and then mythological characters from the ancient Greeks and Romans to explain that Odin and his kin were ""real"" mythological people. It was a bit disjointed and confusing at times.If, however, you're just generally curious and cheap like me, then I suppose it's kind of worth it to get a flavor for the original text."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this as a gift for a friend and was very disappointed it did not come with the gold, frankincense and mryrrh as suggested by the picture and description."
4,"""Please don't leave your home w/o your gats or your knives""","Black Ice and Solo C offer old school gangsta rap that is not quite as brillant as the legendary N.W.A., but pretty close. These guys shot the sheriff AND the deputy on this album. ""Psycho Dream"" is one of the most explicit and gruesome rap numbers I've ever heard."
3,very best of the sun years,This is a present so I won't know how the person likes it until after Christmas. He loves Johnny Cash so it should be fine.
5,The New Thunder!!!,"Simple and direct;the CD rocks!Especially the live stuff.The songs that stand out in my mind are ""Daisy Jane""and""Month Of Sundays"".One of the most underrated bands of the 80's.They never really made it big here;but I love the music.I guess you must be a fan to understand.Recommended to any TNT fan or hard rock in general"
5,The most horrifying book on the Holocaust,"I read this book a few years ago. I've read probably 100+ books on the Holocaust, for all ages and different topics. This is, the most powerful book I have ever read on this subject matter.The last letters speak for themselves--some are so horrifying that I wish I never read them. I am haunted by the despair and terrible things written in these letters. One letter, in particular, outlining the abuse of little girls by the SS, makes one think that Germany will--and should--be forever stained by its past deeds. I am surprised that few people know about this book.The letters were hidden, dropped from trains, left with others--most of the writers died and this is their last testament.This book is the reality, the truth of this time. People with young children should be warned about this book: when you read about the despair of these young parents you won't be able to sleep."
5,Great 60's music.,"Good selection of 60's era music. I bought it for one song, butfound the entire disc to be refreshingly better than many compilations of ""decades""discs. Only 10 tracks on it, but they are all good ones......no obscure ""fill-ins"",which is a relief. Glad I bought it."
1,useless,"If you're gambling in Vegas and can't figure these tips out by yourself, you shouldn't be there. Worst $14 I've ever spent."
4,"Decent, with exceptions...","I'll be honest. I bought this CD just for the fantastic single ""Hitman"" by AB Logic, which I've loved ever since clubbing in the early 90s. Unfortunately, its relative obscurity and inability to found on MP3 led me here. Its still a classic, and the rest of the songs aren't too bad for a nostalgic party. One question, though..where's the KLF?"
5,learned a lot,"Even though I am not Jewish, I found this book fascinating in regards to how the author combined historical details into the daily lives of her characters. This book brought to life a time period of which I did not know much about."
5,Loved this book!,As a grad student of Jewish Women's studies and Jewish history I absolutely loved this book. I felt that everything I have learned came alive in the wonderful characters and well researched descriptions of everyday Jewish life in Medieval France. This book is a real page turner and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.
3,A good Book that should be better,"This is an interesting telling of the lifestyle of Jews at the end of the first millennium CE, in France. It describes some of the life of the scholar Rashi but is primarily about the early years of his daughter Yochoved, the details of which must be fictional. Customs of the times are given and raise many questions. Hidden in its pages is an appeal for early feminism. While it was good reading, in retrospect I think it is rather shallow. Much is glossed over or skipped entirely. For example, the role of Rashi's wife, and of other women, is almost entirely as child bearers. There is only one reference to the Crusades, occurring at that time. Some of Rashi's interpretations and decisions are given but not with the background for his reasoning. Another volume about his second daughter, Miriam, is about to be released. I was left with no desire to pursue it."
2,yuk!,"Half the songs are written by Howe and the other half by Kotzen. I think Kotzen's song contributions are pretty bad, although the first song (""Tilt"") has an amazing solo by Kotzen that I may never forget. I think Kotzen mainly junks up the rest of the album. Skip it."
5,Great Stuff,This food is great.My chiclids love it and it really brought out their color. The fish look healthier and more active.
4,starcastle returns shining,"All of the comparisons that have been made between Starcastle, Yes and various prog-rock bands of their era are valid, but can be deceiving. The playing on this, their first new recording in 30 years, is still above the boards. They still have the tendency to be lyrically ambigous and cosmic, but the melodies work beautifully with the words. The original band is here, although not on every track. All For The Thunder is the track that features the original band with the rest of the disc acting as a collective group playing around the late bassist Gary Strater. All in all, a solid return."
3,Don's Stop the Carnival Review,"I am having a difficult time staying with this book. It is a book club selection for me. I find the story line very slow and at times boring. I don't think in reality someone would let go of life, to catch the brass ring without doing more explicit research. I would not recommend this book to anyone simply because it is so slow moving."
3,Insightful view of an earlier time,"Wouk has captured the spirit of the islands, but in a simpler time unfortunately long past. While many of the frustrations of life in paradise are amusingly presented, the serpent has been in the garden and the apple has been tasted. There are few instances of ""quaint and gentle island culture"" remaining today. There are quite too many demagogues and modern politicians here now. It was refreshing to read how it once was and to be able to see around us the remnants of a kinder and gentler time past. Wouk has remarkable ability to make us laugh at our foibles and see ourselves in his characters. Thorougly enjoyable."
1,Severly dated simplistic,"I read this following the 10 books for a deserted island from Jimmy Buffet's ""A Pirate Looks at 50"". (any one who includes West With The Night is Ok with me) I have lived in the tropics. I found the book to be a dated cliche ridden piece. I know it was written to reflect 1959 but it does not translate in to the present. It is the vision some want to have of a wonderful complex culture and life style.The ending was weak predictable."
3,Entertaining escape from your everyday life,"If you are looking for an easy, fun quick read this is your book. There were some serious moments, but a great escape book for the beach. I have to admit that I cannot see it as a musical, but with Jimmy Buffett anything can happen."
2,"A dated, puerile and inaccurate view of today's Caribbean","Having lived in the Caribbean for many years I can only say that Wouk's rather childish view of the US Virgins was the result of a shallow look at Caribbean island life. The storyline is quite good and some of the 'island style', 'island time' happenings show accurately the frustrations that are a fact in almost every kind of meaningful endeavour that one tries to accomplish in the islands. But Wouk didn't get into the heart of the Caribbean people or their culture (well, a steel band, I suppose) and the fact that the book is set amongst tropical islands. He could have made much more of the water, the beaches, the yachting, the sport fishing that give the islands their vibrancy. The problems that he encountered with the renovating of 'The Gull Reef Club' are accurate and sometimes amusing in a corny sort of way but the ending was weak. Altogther disappointing"
5,Every Writer's Dream,This book belongs on the reference shelf of every serious author. It is extremely easy to navigate through and can help you come up with the appropriate word or phrase that you are searching your brain for. I forgot who suggested this book to me but I am overjoyed that they did. I actually have two copies (one for each one of my offices).
4,Cool book,"Has the best coverage of the eta 528e, an e28 I happen to own. Unlike the James Taylor book which is mostly b/w, this one is almost full color. There's an X5 shown with Stars & Stripes paint scheme, nice work."
2,Quite A Disappointment Especially For e39 M5 Fans,"this book was quite a disappointment. the information is all here, but the photo selection and quality are decidedly 'low-budget.' and, if you are a fan of the current 'king of the mountain' in terms of the bmw 5-series line (and, i dare say, even amongst the so-called 'super-exotic' cars in general) - the e39 m5 - then this book is downright atrocious. many of the photos were take-offs of pdf photos found on many of the more popular bmw enthusiasts websites.when you have hobbyists as fanatical as bmw 5-series owners are, and, in particular, bmw m5 owners (e28, e34 or e39), then you had better well treat them to a lavish, extravagant photo montage.other books do this better, in my humble opinion."
1,quit guitar guys and get a real job,"Why bother. This cd proves he is the best. Not a single note touches the songs the way Jeff played them, same as when someone tries to cover a Jimi Hendrix song. I have a copy of this disk and use it to prop open a small window in my garage. Buy Jeff's music if that is what you want to listen to."
3,not bad,Belt is strong although the buckle doesn't always sinch down very well. As it breaks in it gets a little better though.
1,Lesche Digging Tool,My Opinion Only. Don't waste your money it is not much of anything and should only cost $4.99. Low quality. Something that I would expect to be given away as a promo for Harbor Freight Tools. There is a much nicer and larger copy of the Gator Tool for 21 dollars on amazon and it is stainless steel. Even the Jackson Tool is 5-10 times the quality in my opinion and I have a lot of purchases under my belt. Do some research before you buy this item. Lesche Co is pretty proud of this thing and I have no idea why. If I would have seen this before I purchased it I would have only taken it as a free or promo item.
5,"Finally, readable chick lit","I went through a period where I was completely hooked on chick lit, snatching up such writers as Jane Green, Marian Keyes and Anna Maxted. After a few years I began to lose interest as the genre seems as marketed as a Paris Hilton venture.Escape from Bridezilla has brought me back. The novel is about a bride who has questions about her fiance, and really sees potential in their roommate. Her refelctions are clever, funny and, at times, the character reveals her flaws, which makes her relatable.The author's command of dialogue is superb--her descriptions first-rate. This is a book if you want a fun read that goes by quickly but doesn't insult the intelligence of seasoned readers. Bring it on!"
5,this book truly helped me...,"I have been trying to get started on a novel for months and I wasn't getting anywhere until I picked up this book. The exercises are very useful and really get your creativity flowing. This book offers real advice and inspiration for beginner writers. If you really want to start writing, get this book!"
3,"a bit thin, but getting vivid","This novel, also one of the Nab's earliest, shows him as a maturing writer. While the plot is a bit banal, the Nab brings great vividness and such well-drawn characters to it that I remember some of them from first reading it 20 years ago. THe lives in this are unremittingly dreary, mediocre, and only briefly tinged by passion. I expected more, but it isn't a complete dud."
4,enjoyed very much,we enjoyed watching this veggie tales as usual for us.gave it 4 stars because the streaming Amazon did was way too compressed and took away from the story a bit.
5,peter pan,"as an englishman i should dislike Disney's Peter Pan, i love it, great animation. a film that made me appreciate Walts world when i first saw the picture back 1953.i always under the impression The Robe was first in wide screen?"
3,A good kids movie but the content is abit outdated.,"After sitting down and watching this movie for the 20th time this week, I must still agree with my special little guy that this is a great movie. He loves it and that is important since it is a kids movie. Forget about the cinematic effects or the lack of. The real important question is: do the kids like it? My kid loves it! And I am sure that your kids will too...Why the 3 stars, well the movie uses some time ""filler"" scenes with a native American theme. I find this scene to be abit unrelated and stereotypes native Americans/Canadians. Too many politically incorrect references that are out of touch with today's society. I have to explain to my little guy that the movie is wrong and that these references are not acceptable in this day and society. Other then that it's a great film."
3,A good movie marred by some embarassing stereotypes,"This is an enchanting story, and I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for a bit of unfortunate sterotyping of American Indians. In particular, a song sung by the Indian characters (""What Makes The Red Man Red?"") is intended to be funny, but now it just comes across as embarrassing. I fully realize this sort of thing was par for the course in Hollywood at the time. But it's still unfortunate that I now have to explain to my kids that it's really NOT OK in our family to use skin color as the punch line to a joke."
3,Times they have a-changed!,"This is a Disney classic, and I have fond memories of watching it as a little girl. There is one thing I would have wanted to be aware of, however, before my purchase. Times have changed a great deal, politically and socially, since this movie was made (1951 I believe). The depictions of native americans are very stereotypical of the time - they are dumb and ugly, and the pirates are much more accurately depicted than would be true in a movie made today. These things do not detract from enjoyment of the film, however you might want to think twice before showing it to a younger child, or provide an explanation to an older child who is watching for the first time."
5,Loved it!,"This movie sparked a love for ""Tink"" that my 3 year old is VERY eager to tell everyone about! It's a must-have."
2,Dated and Disappointing,"My wife and I are big Disney fans and purchased this movie with a lot of anticipation. We were both extremely disappointed. Almost all of the characters in this film are cruel and unlikeable, including Peter Pan himself. Tinkerbell is nasty and consumed with jealousy, completely one-dimensional, and Peter is a shallow, self-absorbed imp. It's hard to imagine anyone--especially sweet Wendy--liking him. Even minor characters like the mermaids are given a jealous, petty edge.The playful theme that we associate with the Peter Pan tale is almost nowhere to be found in this movie. I can see by all the positive reviews that my view is in the minority, and that's okay. I really wanted to like this movie, but couldn't. I kept hoping that Captain Hook--who had his hand cut off by Peter and fed to a crocodile (!)--could get ahold of bratty Peter and teach him a lesson."
5,Awesome,My whole family loves this movie. Everyone was glued to the TV especially me since I hadn't seen it for years.
4,Gave as a gift-No complaints,Gave as a gift-no complaints. Packaging was fine for a used DVD and they watched it with no problems. Both Discs were inside.
4,great movie but still old style animation,"because the cover style, I thought it was going to be a modern animated movie, but it still uses the old style with no ""Great"" colorful quality image. But it is ok for children."
1,Peter Pan DVD,I wanted my 5 yr. old twin grandsons to be able to see what a great movie Peter Pan. They loved it!
3,Peter Pan,"Did I miss something in watching this version? I seem to recall that when Tinker Bell's light is fading the audience is asked to repeat that ""I believe in fairies"" or something to that effect. However, in this version, that portion has been edited out. Peter locates Tinker Bell as her light is fading and we know she is seriously injured and then it simply cuts to the pirate ship and then Peter and Tinker show up just fine with no explanation of how she survived. What gives? Political correctness of an anti-belief in fairy type?"
4,Peter Pan,"I Bought this as a Christmas Gift and was able to also watch it . A great Disney classic, highly recomended"
5,Not gonna grow up,What could possibly be wrong with this classic.I enjoyed it as a kid and watched it with my kids andnow as my kids having their own I can't wait to watchit with my grandchildren.
5,this cd is one of the best,"The gambino family is truly talented. the beats are moving, and the lyrics flow smoothly. my favorite songs are desperado(one of my favorite nl songs) clean sweep, 2 all my thug n*gg**, mafiosos, oh heck all the songs are good. If you like rap you will like this cd."
3,This cd is pretty good.,I think that master p should have been more on there songs. To improve them.
2,Weak Squeaker,"I purchased thinking that the squeaker was built into the middle of the toy. My 1 year old beagle was smarter than me and discovered it was set into one of the ends. He promptly tore off the yellow fuzz around only the squeaker part and once exposed, pulled the squeaker value out. Luckily I was monitoring his play time so I prevented him from eating it.At least it seems resistant to puncturing and still works as a toy. I don't think my dog will have much interest in it anymore without the squeak however. Maybe he'll still enjoy tearing off the yellow fuzz (which may be the only thing he won't eat). His purpose in life is to locate and destroy the squeaker. This toy was no challenge for him."
3,trial,My dog is not really interested in it....I just bought it as a trial....probably the toy is fine but not for my dog
1,Not for Extreme Chewer,My Shepard was able to get to squeaker and rip it out upon presentation. Unless constant monitoring of item is enlisted it will be torn apart in minutes by your large dog.
3,Kong Air Dog Squeaker,"I ordered this to replace a smalle Kong Bone that our dog simply loved. The previous one was smaller but the cover came off rather quickly. Within a day, our Lapsha had a large section of the cover off of this one plus had chewed out the squeaker plug. I guess it is better than him chewing on the furniture"
2,Spend your MOney ON the Cd's,This is only for people who don't want to take the time to listen to Dylan's Cd's form this peiod. Buy the book's about the Rolling Thunder & Gospel years.This DVD will leave you wishing you spent your money on something better.
3,Intelligent headbanging,"Virtuosity at the sake of compositional integrity has been the bane of solo progressive guitar vitality in irregular proportions. Kotzen is no exception, dazzling with technique and rarely capturing complete tracks before splintering off into indulgent runs. As beautiful a slide of notes on a well honed electric guitarist's fretboard sounds in and of itself, without something to wrap around of substantial value, the technicality becomes limited and in the end, unnecessary. Fortunately IGFE fights against this by injecting more traditional prog-rock elements as well as diversifying the sound a bit."
4,Excellent until 1970s,"This book was a great read. I recommend it for folks, like me, who do not know much about early rock 'n' roll or its evolution. I really had a sense of awe and discovery at reading about 1940s and 1950s rock. The author effectively captures the excitement that the new music generated and the cultural revolution it spawned. The chapters on the early years, 1947 and Jump Blues, the 1950s and Elvis, and so on, were excellent and made me want to go out and buy some of these records. Believe me, no book has ever made me want to buy an Elvis recording, but this one has. Most of the book is taken up with the 1940s-60s, and are the best parts. I lost some interest at the point where I was familiar with the music personally, having started collecting records in 1972, and could relate to the 1970s music and artists myself."
3,smallish,its smaller then expected but it arrived earlier then expected and my girlfreind is happy with it. so i have no problem with it at all
5,buy it,the fiddle is immense..great band...even the cover is inspired. if this doesn't get your tapping i will refund your money.
4,Finished it in one day,It's hard to come across books that are so hard to put down you stay up til 6am to finish it! I hope there is a sequel where the protagonist gets her man though.
3,4 out of 5 stars,"im a big bukowski fan . i didnt love this collection nor did i hate it . i was more indifferent and found myself sometimes reading thru the poems quickly. out of the 5 of his books ive read thus far, this one has the least amount of pages marked with poems to go back and read"
2,Too Expensive,"I used this product along with a number of other Yon-Ka products for about a year. I have had moderate breakouts for many years and was hoping this would be the solution to the problem (an esthetician recommended them to me). They weren't. Granted, my use of them was not always the twice-a-day regimen I was supposed to do, but even when I was really good at doing the regimen like I was supposed to for weeks at a time, the results were mediocre at best. Not super encouraging. I will say that it feels really refreshing when you spray the toner on, but it's just not worth the cost since there are other (cheaper) products I've found since that are a lot more effective overall."
3,In the Fall,This book is hard to read due to extensive descriptive wording. The story is wonderful but it takes time and perseverance to finish. The story could have been conveyed in many less pages.
1,in the fall,"Although a first novel, which shows promise, Lent is too wordy and self-important which manifests itself in the prose. The book is depressing. The minute you turn to page two, you know that nothing good is going to happen to the characters. Lent copies too much from recent best-sellers, i.e., Cold Mountain, Beloved and Color Purple. If he would choose his own subject, perhaps his prose would flow better."
3,"Didn't like the story, but the writing is great!","If you want to enjoy good writing, read it. If you want to enjoy a good story, don't read it. I found the book dark and depressing and the end a let-down. I also didn't like the way the story jumps from one generation to the next while I still had questions about the earlier generation.The story isn't to my taste, but others may love it."
3,Too long but had good bones!,"I agree with several other reviewers who found this book much too long and overwritten. Some of the rambling thoughts, often very deep for the types of characters thinking such thoughts, were really overdone. Sometimes the language was hauntingly beautiful and sometimes it was so smothered in wordiness as to not be comprehensible.That said, I think the bones of a good story were there, just too well-padded to always be evident. The author took an interesting approach and the story was somewhat different than other post-Civil War tales. This was the only thing that kept me reading.....but I must admit that I often scanned long passages that seemed to take detours away from the heart of the plot.I look forward to watching this author's progress."
4,Great book!,There are lots of cool effects in this book. It will be a bit overwhelming due to the extent of the actionscript but these effets can be copied and added to your website or movie. I am going to keep the book and use it again and again.
4,Wonderful Music and Lyrics,"Fates Warning's Jim Matheos likes to use a soft approach when compared to his Prog colleagues. Instead of using instrumental workouts that last forever, Parallels concentrates on sonic textures to deliver its lyrical message. Lyrics and music stand on equal footing here. Some accused FW to have sold out in this album. Indeed, it sounds almost mainstream. There is nothing wrong with that. If you want to be wowed by sheer instrumental prowess, go check out John Petrucci from Dream Theater. If you like your prog to have lot of depth, check out Parallels. Eye to Eye and Point of View are obvious favorites but the whole album is excellent."
2,Lackluster snoozefest,"This cd misses the progressive elements that they've had before in previous efforts. It's just very mellow with hardly any energy to it. I just obtained NO EXIT and while I'm not that into it now, it will probably grow on me in the future. I really can't understand all the five star reviews here on Amazon because this album goes nowhere. I already own AWAKEN THE GUARDIAN, and it's the only one that I fully get into. I have THE SPECTRE WITHIN coming to me in the mail and am crossing my fingers that I'm going to like it. This cd is pretty bad, so, I can't recommend it."
5,Why Don't You Own This?,"I have been a fan of Iain ( then called Ian ) Matthews since his days as Lead Singer ( with Sandy Denny ) in Fairport Convention way back in 1968. This is his 1990 release and of all the LP's, cassettes and CD's I have by him, I have always enjoyed this one most of all.It begins with "" Like Dominoes "" and it's a stunner, yeah, it's a Pop Song but it is a GREAT Pop Song. Peter Gabriel's ""Mercy Street "" is next and as much as I enjoy Peter's version, this one is better. ""New Shirt "" , "" Bridge of Cherokee "" and "" Rains of 62 "" are all fantastic tunes as well.This version of "" Pure and Crooked "" is the updated Remaster from the mid-Nineties and it includes 5 Bonus Tracks: ""Drive"", ""Voices"", ""I Don't Want To Talk About It "". ""Wings"", & "" O'Connell Street Revisted "", and they add more value to this Purchase.The Production is 5 Star, The Songs are 5 Star and Iain's vocals are 10 Star. The only thing better than listening to this CD is attending one of his Concert's... BUY IT..."
1,Didn't Work for Me,"I have a 9 month old at home and have been solely breastfeeding her. I eat a healthy diet & drink about a gallon of water a day, but my production has slowly decreased over time. My stored milk had begun to run out, so I turned to this tea and also tried the fenugreek pills. I drank several cups of this tea every day for three weeks, just as directed on the box, yet I didn't produce even half an ounce more than I have been consistently making. While this tea may work well for others, I am personally disappointed with the lack of results."
4,Yeahy More Milk!,A friend of mine recommended this item my first month and thank goodness for getting good recommendations. First it works within a hour or so you got more milk production. I normally drink a cup towards the evening hours when I fall short. Also helps when you go through a milk clog and the production slows down it helps a lot to get you back to where you need to be for your baby. The milk tea as my husband describes it smells like liqurious candy and it kind a does. As a devoted tea drinker it was also nice to have something to drink besides camomile tea. So the Subscription deal comes pretty handy.
1,Didn't work at all,What a waste - of course I got excited from reading the reviews and bough the whole damn case which I can't return now. I made GALLONS of this and drank it all the time....NO difference at all in my milk production.THe pills worked sooo much better. This was a complete waste. My baby also got very drowsy and lethargic while I was taking it so I stopped the tea and went on the fenugreek pills...the result? Happy alert baby and more milk production.
2,It works fine,"It works. but if you get diarrhea definitely stop using it. I used it a few times, but not enough to get me back on track."
5,mama's tea,"Used this tea with my first girl ad am using it again with my second. Wish I'd known about subscribe and save back then. Great price, great tea."
1,not satisfied,I really did not see that this product hepled me in increasing my milk supply. Not only did it not help me but it has a bitter taste.
1,not satisfied.,I bought 6 box of this tea last April 7 because of a nice review. The taste is okay but I did not see that this product help me in increasing my milk supply. I just waste my money.
4,This stuff works!,I am a person who always is constipated. Once I drink this tea within 24 hours I use the bathroom! It's totally worth buying.
4,Ooops!,"Anybody notice that the title of the new DVD set is CSI: The Complete Sixth Season (2000)? Hello, what's with the 2000? I believe it should read 2005? Or am I missing something here?As for season 6, better than 5, not as good as 4 or 3 or 2 or 1. Sara and Grissom yech. Unless season 7 throws a chink in the relationship which could be interesting."
3,CSI Season 6,"The season is great, the only problem I had was all the discs were skipping or freezing during some episodes."
3,"For all the hype, it was only partially worth it.","I really loved CSI in the beginning, and it seems like after this season, the show started to drop off. The dvd has some cool special features, but I probably wouldn't have paid so much for it if I'd seen it at someone else's house first."
5,Download Slow,Unless I can download it faster and burn it to a DVD have it play on my TV it's becoming more of a hassle and with all the downloads i've done between itunes and amazon I should have just bought the DVDs It would have took an hour to have drive time and then 5 minutes to prepare myself for a marathon. A lot better than 30 minutes for each episode Luck I'm falling in love with this show.
5,CSI is the best show,CSI is the best show on television. Each season brings more and more excitement. I love them all! Anyone who has not seen any of these shows must watch and get hooked.
3,Didn't seem to be relevant,to the characters. Someone gets married and two start seeing each other. The stories just weren't that great!
4,A great book by a great author,"It is a great book by a great author. I have to say that this book has brought me back into the fantasy genre, which, I hadn't read in a long time. The sophisticated writing and description of the characters of the magical land of Pryland puts you right in the character's shoes. The Book of Three has a great plot, which mixed with a touch of humor, makes you want to lock yourself up in your room and keep reading until you finish the book. The Book of Three sometimes is a little hard to follow because of the many strange names of the characters. However, the map illustrated in the first page makes everything easier. In conclusion, it is a great book for young adult fiction."
5,I love these books.,"since the first day I started reading these books, I have loved them. They are one of my favorite sets of books and I'm not even a little kid anymore.Elionwy is my favorite. I love how she always says that one thing is like the other, when it's really nothing alike."
5,Just as good as I remember...,"I read this series when I was little, and I still LOVE it! Well written and a good book all around.. especially if you're trying to get your kids into reading."
1,Dont Read,this book sucked. all the other people in my book group and I hated this book. there is only a stupid plot about a pig running away
5,The Gateway to My Love of Fantasy Novels,"More than any other series (other than Tolkien) this series of books firmly solidified my love of the genre at an early age. I read them over and over again in the late 1970's and into the 1980's, and still have my original copies that i plan on giving to my son when he is old enough..."
4,The Book of Three,"This book is about a boy named Taran and his friend, Coll, who live in Prydain. He wants to learn how to sword fight so his friend teaches him. His pig Henwin runs away and leads him into danger, and evil is prowling the land of Prydain. It's up to Taran to stop evil.The Book of Three is a fiction fantasy for grades 4 to 6. It is an adventurous and dramatic story. It's a book that makes you wonder what's going to happen next.This book is the first book of the Prydain sequel of 5 books. I like this book because it is adventurous and exciting. I would give this book 4 stars."
1,A string of two word sentences,"I truly don't see how anyone can think this is a good book. It reads like a gritty Dr. Seuss novel. It's a string of 2 word sentences that leaves everything to the imagination because it says nothing. The characters are stereotypes and under developed. It is the equivalent of a ""B"" action movie that depends on a ""blood splatter"" trailer to bait naive movie goers. Horrible book."
1,Arab propaganda garbage,"The book has no facts & only Palestinian one sided lies. How does one explain that only about 50 Palestinians were killed during the IDF raid (in response against the suiside bombings the Jews pursued by the Palestinians)Among those killed most were (according to the UN) armed terrorists. It's up to the Arabs to choose their own heroes, they have made their choice for homicidial fanatics like Osama Ben Laden (the more they kill the merrier according to the Palestinians, but for liberal and/or anti-Semitic idiots out there -- wake up and stop applauding this madness."
4,Pretty good overview...,"Not a bad review on HRT options. Really quite technical and full of details that anyone but a health care provider will have difuculty fully grasping, but for those laypeople motivated to read it, it will still be quite usefull. As a health care provider myself, I wish the book was less wordy and had more bullet point summary charts with just the facts listed about various treatment options. Still, good information overall, and once I get motivated enough to type up my own summary sheets, I will likely use the info quite a bit in practice."
5,Every story in volume 3 is by Eisner,"Some corrections need to be made to some of the other reviews of Spirit Archives. All the work in volume 3 is Eisner. There are some stories later in volume 4 that Eisner did not do the full finished art for but he wrote and did layouts for every one of those later stories as well as some penciling and perhaps a little inking. There are only 5 stories with substantial Eisner input in volumes 6 and 7 combined, none in 8-10, and Eisner didn't resume work on the strip continuously until the Christmas Spirit of 1945 at the end of volume 11. But every story in volume 3 is written and drawn by Eisner."
4,Very good for the very basic.,"This is a very good book for a beginner who wants to learn the basic concepts of effective unarmed combat. These basic concepts are taught to special forces of many of the world's militant forces, so it is an excellent starter book for someone wanting to train in REAL and EFFECTIVE self defense. By reading this book, a begginer will efficently expose him/herself to defense tactics which can be used in real life self defense, and it may also help the reader select a martial art that can be applied to real life. I'm not trying to say that many of the martial arts out there are ineffective in real life situations, but the concepts covered in this book are used by militant forces that must use these techniques in order to survive, so they MUST be effective.This book, however, will be relatively useless to an expirienced or advanced fighter/ martial artist."
3,"Very extensive, best for advanced cooks.","This book is very extensive with a mind boggling amount of recipes. The author obviously spent many months, probably even years researching. It is better for the more advanced cook. Many of the recipes are complicated, or call for ingredients that a beginner like me just isn't familiar with. There are still many that are simpler and some that you can adapt to easier methods. If you are interested in this style of foods, it will help you to learn the flavor combinations, inspiring you to create your own (simpler, if need be) recipes. I also wish there were more pictures, there is only a small section at the front with a handful of recipes illustrated. This might help clarify some of the recipes that seem too complicated to the less experienced cook."
1,Not for heart health&#65533;,"I was placed on The Mediterranean Diet by my physician because I need drastic improvement in my cholesterol levels. If you are looking for ways to get started or for recipies, don't buy this book! Although Mr. Wright seems to have a winning reputation and the book is filled with authentic, flavorful recipies it does not relate to heart-based eating. The ingredients include eggs, full-fat yogurt, cheeses, shellfish such as shrimp, and butter. Choosing and buying this book was my mistake; I just don't you to make the same one! You will find it a complete waste of money if heart-health is your goal. Buy The Mediterranean Heart Diet by Helen V. Fisher instead."
5,Love these clothes pins,Great old fashion clothes pins my only complaint is that I should have ordered (3) packages.
5,Vintage early '70s rap session with the voice of experience,"This driving, bitter and uncompromising indictment of American society may be Gil Scott-Heron's best album ever. He was perhaps the innovator to the present day rap craze, a worldwide phenomenon that has surpassed color lines and national origins and is the voice of the angry, strident and disconnected men and women of today. Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson teamed up to perform some very nice material on this album, especially ""Song for Bobby Smith"", ""H2OGate Blues"", ""Your Daddy Loves You"" and ""The Bottle"". Though a bit dated, the music here underscores those turbulent times of many years ago, and the young voices today are as angry now as they were then."
1,Garbage,"This book is such a complete piece of antiscientific, ocultist nonsense that its continuing popularity in a highly educated country like France is really hard to explain. Only for those interested in cultural oddities from the 60's."
5,Extreme Cult/Occult theories,"Fans of fantastic conspiracy, biblical revelation,Hitler and the evolved new man will love this book. Morning of the Magicians reads like a thriller and encourages its readers with hints and directions to build suspense. Readers who liked Holy Blood/Holy Grail should check this out..I found lots of mateerial I hadnt seen elsewhere."
5,A book to read over & over!,A rewarding and wonderful book of tales that will touch anyone who loves dogs. Every tale will touch you with memories of a Labrador Retriever you once had or bring closer to your Labrador pal that you now share your heart with. a must gift for anyone who owns a Labrador Retriever!
2,very antiquish looking,"I've wanted a poison ring for quite some time now and when I saw this one, well it was just perfect. However when it arrived, the garnet looked a little fake and the latch on the locket part wasn't very tight and the locket would sometimes open therefore dumping any contents I had inside. :(. So with that in mind, I really don't wear it as often as I would have liked to when I ordered it, but it is a beautiful ring to wear and it makes a great conversational piece."
1,Size Not Stated,"I like this series of books, but they come in 2 sizes and i want all same size, the smaller. This was the big size so need to return now and try to find one the smaller size."
3,Odd Collection of Essays,"18 wheelers, ocean vessels, lake freighters, river barges, third party logistics, air freight, lobster farms and canoes. Each story has something of interest. Each topic is covered in a conversational style, focusing on real people. The author provides some insights into each profession and the people who hold these jobs.In the end, we have the author's idiosynchratic views of selected representatives of selected careers within the transportation industry. The book is OK."
4,"Great book, horrible editing","I read this more because I am a fan of Taibo than because of Che, but I have read other biographies of Che and this is clearly the best I've seen - one of the best biographies I have read, in fact. He makes you feel as though you knew him yourself.This edition, at least, misses getting a five-star rating from me, however, due to the perfectly atrocious editing! There are literally hundreds of typos, misspellings, poorly phrased sentences, etc. It is very distracting."
4,Don't assume that you can assume,"Emily L. is one of the required books for my current English Elective course, Post-Modern Fiction.There are two main characters in the book, a person called ""I"" and another ""You"", both French. This couple is observing another couple in a bar, and based on what snippets of conversation they hear, they construct a story around the latter couple.This book is fiction, no doubt, but soon you begin to question which parts of the story that ""I"" constructed are based on true observation, and which parts are pure fiction.A fiction within a fiction, Emily L. draws you in completely. This is a translation, but it does not interfere with the gist, tone, or mood of the story. Some nuances might have been lost due to translation, but that does not prevent you from enjoying the book.After all, it does take a lot for a ""general fiction""-category book to hook an avid sci-fi/fantasy reader like Yours Truly."
1,Frustration PLUS! Flimsy construction!,"Instructions which come with this item are woefully inadequate to get a person started. Everything I tried to make it work with my iPaq pocket PC resulted in building frustration when it STILL wouldn't work. I finally decided to set the keyboard aside and went to fold it back up, only it started to break up instead!The end of all this was that the keyboard wound up in two pieces (roughly) on the floor. [...] and I will no longer consider ANY bluetooth keyboard for my iPaq."
5,Works well,"Worked to my expectations. I had a broken laptop and wanted to use the HD as an external HD to my new MacBook Pro before I recycled my old laptop. Setup took longer than 30 minutes because I had little clue of how it all fitted. Though the quality of the material looks a bit cheap, other than that, no complains."
3,Hard drive dust jacket,"This enclosure is incredibly cheap, and does allow you to power and read a drive by USB. It is not a long term solution for drive storage because there is no support inside the enclosure to keep the drive from clanging around. It connects on one end with the pins and secures with two tiny screws. The other end of the drive is free to clink against the enclosure as you move it around. It'll work for moving data over, and that's all I expect or need from it."
1,you get what you pay for!,"Got it the first of June and went bad in two months! plain and simple you get what you pay for! when ever i plugged it in the light would stay red and pc/laptop would not read the drive. i tested the drive and it was fine. i'm going to try another enclosure and review. good luck if you buy it, i mean its cheap so you probably get your moneys worth!"
4,"Not bad, not great...","My old laptop died, and I needed to get the files copied over to my new laptop. I had an old external 3.5 IDE enclosure but my 3.5 to 2.5 adapter was worn out. I went straight to Amazon, found this and I figured for the price it can't be beat. This is by far not the most rugged enclosure I have seen, but I just wanted a quick and cheap way to get my stuff. I like the fact that I do not need an external power supply, but it does come with a Y type usb cable so you can plug it into two usb ports if you need the extra power. So far I have tried with Windows 7 and XP, and with three drives. Will it last for the long haul, only time will tell, but if you need to get to files quickly and cheaply it is worth it."
3,"Good enclosure for an emergency, but not durable enough for daily use","I bought this to transfer the contents of a laptop harddrive from a laptop that died and it worked well, but it does not appear to be very durable. Very cheap plastic all around, cheap looking connectors. Great if you're in a pinch, but don't expect it to last."
2,This case is too simple and I think it's unsafe for the hard disk,You can only fix the case and the disk with two pin. If you shake the case you will hear the sound from disk.
4,Can't beat the price!,"I bought this to store a hard drive from a broken Mac G3 laptop. Fit perfectly, looks great, although slightly different from pictured (sturdy, plain metallic blue with pseudo-vaio logo). Looks like it was intended for use with Sony Vaio laptop hard drives. Case comes with leather sleeve and firewire adapter. Green light turns on when connected. Would not recommend for use with Intel imacs, since the ""drivers"" cd-rom is smaller than a normal disc size."
2,Enclosure IDE 2.5,"Cuando compre este producto decia que la capacidad máxima era de 500Gb, peroahora que vino, la capacidad máxima es de 120Gb, me enviaron un producto equivocado,si usted lo va a comprar exija que sea de la capacidad que anuncian.This product is not the right to buy, this is only 120Gb capacity, and said he had bought which was 500GB, do not buy it!Bad product."
4,"Works OK, long wait for shipping","This case works well with my old hard drive and helped me diagnose my computer's problem as RAM issue, not HDD. It is a little flimsy, but lets you connect a second HDD to your computer through a USB port. It installed instantly on my 10 yo Toshibal laptop running XP, and is a good value for the price. Took over 3 weeks to receive from Asia."
4,Nice and functional,The item came quickly and fast. It works exactly as promised. I'm happy because with it I managed to have back all my data I had in a hard drive.
3,IDE enclosure,"Product works well and was easily assembled. I had difficulty finding 2 tiny coutersunk screws to hold the assembly to the case which I thought should be part of the kit, otherwise I am satisfied. It was cheap and is cheap."
1,Damaged,"The item came so damaged that it was not recognizable. It was cheap so, it wasn't worth the effort to to follow up. The saying goes, you get what you pay for."
4,Need an additional male-to-male USB cord,"A customer had an older IBM Thinkpad with an IDE hard drive. The laptop stopped working and was unrepairable. The drive was not backed up, so we removed it an put it in this external case. Windows 7 would not read the drive or load the drivers and gave errors. The problem was the cord that was shipped with the enclosure. It has a split end which is not only useless, it caused an error. Using a male-to-male USB cord fixed the problem. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on an obsolete IDE enclosure, so this one did the trick after adding a new USB cord. I wouldn't depend on it for long term use."
5,Great IDE Drive Enclosure!,Works wonderfully for getting access to my laptop drive after the motherboard died. I recommend this for anyone that has an IDE drive laying around as a great way to create a cheap external drive.
3,Too little for a MacBook hard drive!,"The case was too small, barely too small, for my MacBook hard drive. It only cost $6, so I'm not terribly disappointed, but would have enjoyed having the hard drive enclosed! Does not come with any connectors, so you'll need to purchase them separately."
4,Great case,I have owned it for a wile now I use uit to format laptop har drives and storage. Works great If I ever need another I will buy this model.
3,Adequate and not much more.,"As a computer-not-so-saavy person, I appreciate how easy this product was to use. I didn't even need instructions (and that's really saying something). This is a great product for when you're in a bind and just need an efficient way to get your data from Point A to Point B. Admittedly, the construction is shoddy, but if you're just looking for a short term solution, it's tolerable. The biggest problem I had was that the endcaps didn't fit right after I inserted my harddrive. The fit seemed perfect outside of the aluminum case, but when the drive was inside the case, the plastic tabs that hold on the endcap created too snug a fit. I couldn't get the endcap on, and had to file the tabs down -not a huge problem, but a bit of a nuisance.Given the low price and the fact that it gets the job done without too much complication, I would buy this product again (but only as a short-term solution)."
5,Great buy,"Very inexpensive, works perfectly with my old gateway laptop hdd. Not sure what the dual headed usb cord is for, but it works so im happy."
2,Not for the novice nor intermediate user,"If you are looking for a beginning or intermediate book for Photoshop 4, don't buy this one. As a long time user of Photoshop, I was looking for some hints in making better graphics. The layout of the book was a wasteland, meaning it was difficult to find info and not layed out well."
4,"Great Book, but not if your a novice","Overall this is a great book, but only if you have been using photo Shop for quite a while. If you are a novice than I suggest you skip this book,or read it a get a HUGE headache figuring it out!"
2,"Good follow up, but more like trying to recreate the original","As I have spent years listening to the original recordings and the true classic Frampton Comes Alive, I can't really pinpoint where I stand with this live album. It is good, and shows Frampton in his natural habitat; live on stage. I have to point out that most every moment or song on this album seems to be an echo of tidbits from the original album. If you took all of the successful ingredients of the first and attempted to replicate it on another live CD this would be the result. Peter still rips on Les Paul guitar as always."
4,"Good while pregnant, not postpartum","I ordered this to help with labor and was told by my O.B. that this tea was safe to drink while I was pregnant. However, he found Australian studies that were showing that Raspberry Leaf tea can decrease milk supply. I immediately stopped drinking it. It does not have a bold flavor, and is very good with honey."
2,Reacted badly to this tea,"I actually had bad effects using this tea. I was given it by a friend and was unaware of its medicinal properties (so was my friend, fyi). Within 15 minutes I was starting to get paranoid and less socially apt, and started to feel distant from everything which was going on. Before long, I was also tending towards depression (which I've experienced before while on birth control, so I caught the signs of it). I also felt like fainting at a few points. The effects did go away within about 5 hours. This was after drinking only a quarter of a mug of it.These are actually the same reactions I had to two different varieties of the birth control pill. So, if you've reacted badly to birth control, be warned that you may also react badly to this tea. Or, you may be lucky in that it will not affect you. Take care if you do try it, and good luck!"
1,these are *NOT* Simmons brand changing pad covers,"These are *not* Simmons brand changing pad covers, as advertised! In fact, the packaging of the covers (sold by Baby Age) said ""BONUS: not for individual retail,"" which I found a bit unsettling. They fit our Simmons changing pad reasonably well, so if that's all you're looking for, these are a decent match. However, with no labelling on the covers themselves, there's no way to know what they are made of, and these do have a very very strong chemical smell (which dissipates after a couple of washes). If you're looking to cover a vinyl changing pad with something less chemical-y, these are definitely not ideal."
2,if you look for something similar to UK don't buy it,"Maybe it's good but if you look for something similar to UK don't buy it, you will be disapointed.It's purely electronic instrumental music. He plays here solely on Synclavier Music Computer (whatever it is) - not a bit of this magic electric violin which I so much love on ""Danger Money""."
1,Failed out of the box,"It just dint get through. Failed to start up, it was a mess.....Expected an upgrade to USB 3.0 with all the hype in comparison with its previous gen. No prompt help from customer support cell either...Checking out another brand."
2,Not Ready for Vista,"The speed of this card with the D-Link N router is impressive. However, when installed on my HP laptop running Vista premium, the laptop would not shut down properly. When the card was installed, the laptop would automatically restart everytime after shutdown. The only way to stop the laptop was to force a shutdown by holding the power button down. The D-Link Vista drivers are beta only and won't install since they do not work for the DWA-643. When I emailed D-Link about the problem and that the Vista drivers were wrong they just emailed instructions on how to install the bad drivers which did not work."
1,function over form,"the item functions well enough, however the mechanical connection it makes with the xpress card slot is very poor. the card can be accidentally dislodge from the slot with the slightest nudge, and this can readily happen because the card itself sticks out of the slot well-over an inch. the card, when connected functions as expected, but seating the card and keeping it seated are a rea lhassle. therefore, I do not recommend you buy one...I got mine as a refurb for $30 dollars, so I don't feelas though I got robbed ,but if I had paid retail price, I'd have returned this for a refund, based on it's poor mechanical, not it's good electrical capabilities .JD"
5,Works in Israel,Good for me. It's a good one and starts slow and ends real fast and even has a max boost speed which is nuts. Works great. No problems here in Israel.
4,"Not perfect, but endearing.","I know this flick was a costly flop, but I couldn't help enjoying it. I had the sense that Beatty and Hoffman very much enjoyed making it. I thought of it as a love letter to itself. A langorous, confident embrace that sort of went nowhere.If you're an Isabelle Adjani fan, you will be disappointed. It turns out she is nothing without her hair and make up! Try Roman Polanski's the Tenant to enjoy her acting. In Ishtar, she plays a woman dressed as a man for much of the time.It's goofy, it's fun, and there's a great vulture scene..."
3,"Yes, it IS on DVD, but...","You can buy it for less than ten bucks (including postage) on Amazon.co.uk, and it comes with optional subtitles in: Arabic, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish. The catch is you need a region-free DVD player."
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE!,"I was shocked when I read the negitive reviews. I thought the characters, story and music were all fantastic. 2 years after first seeing this movie, I was on a first date with a girl when we started talking favorites. When we got to movies we both said in unison ""Ishtar"". I had to marry her. We re-watch it at least twice a year."
5,Ishtar Made My Life Worth Living,"One of the Best Kept Secrets in the Movie Industry is just How absolutely wonderful this film truly is. Its been panned so often that most people nay it just to be in vogue. If you've ever enjoyed Bill Murray's old Sat Night Live skit as a bad lounge singer than this film will make you weep with joy. Where else can you see Hoffman and Beatty actually singing songs so laughable that you'll hold your side in pain .Some day people will sit up and take notice of this film, until then Im glad I have my copy. Please Lord Let the Powers that be put this gem on dvd soon."
2,A Joke Within A Joke,"A couple of really bad singers and songwriters with hilariously horrendous lyrics makes for a very funny bit; especially when played to dry perfection by Hoffman and Beatty, but this is also the problem. What would play beautifully as a 5 minute skit on Saturday Night Live, is stretched into a full length feature production running well over 2 hours. To make matters worse, this amusing one-joke note is backed up by a plot that refuses to take it's audience seriously. Neither funny or plausible, this wholly unbelievable script runs like a very long-winded cartoon. In one ""so bad it's insulting"" scene, the incredible irony of the entire movie struck me: Elaine May, Dustin Hoffman, and Warren Beatty lost in a creation of their own making, (about two awful entertainers who have no idea how bad they really are), and just like their own characters, with no clue whatsoever as to how atrocious their movie is. Now that's funny."
1,Only in Hell's video store,"I once saw a ""Far Side"" cartoon where people were standing around in hell's video store, and the only selection was ""Ishtar."" That about sums up this huge lummox of a movie.Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty have enough star power to deflect the critical barbs that would have sunk lesser actors. Maybe it was just self-indulgence and hubris that led them into the quicksand of this incredibly bad plot and execution. Or maybe they really thought they'd be the next Bob Hope/Bing Crosby team. Either way, ""Ishtar"" has become the byword for Hollywood dreck. It's not for nothing that when ""Waterworld"" was foisted upon the movie-going public, it was dubbed Kevin Costner's ""Fishtar."""
4,masked rider shows true face,neil peart shares the fragile side of a man who is safe behind his fame and fortune at home but very naked when among a group of accidental tourists.His interaction with others is in contrast to his protected life and he is racing through Africa with this group but knowing very well he like all men are really best left alone.
5,A trip without moving,"You will feel like you're there, with Neil and his companions. You will feel the heat, the smells, the vibe and beat of the people he knew along this awesome trip.Neil Peart is great with words. When leaving his own experiences he has the gift to share all of them with us. And we become a little less distant from the ""legend"" we praise."
2,great escapism fun,"back when i was like 12, this was my favorite film. i would watch it over and over and over again. it helped my imagination soar. ofcourse now, looking back, i see how much of a B-movie it really is. but it was still fun escapism when i was younger."
5,Conan,"Conan, Beastmaster, and Legend are my 3 favorite fantasy movies to this day. Ancient Earth warfare and dark magic with hotties! This is a Spike TV type movie for guys who like to eat meat and lift weights with a beer in one hand and a gorgeous blond in the other. Although not Lord of the Rings quality, certainly in the top 10 best fantasy movies ever. You won't regret buying it."
1,DONT BUY,"this product is so cheap it took a week for it to come in. and the quality gets changes, CHEAP"
3,So How Much Did They Have to Pay for that PG-13 Rating?,"Take a hero with superhuman powers (yea!), match him up against a villain with apparently identical powers (uh-oh!), and you have The Dark Knight. I always hated it that Batman movies are filmed in the dark, but that's Batman's shtick and what are you gonna do about it? This sequel isn't just visually dark, it's dark to the core of its very soul . . . so dark, in fact, I wonder how it managed to get its PG-13 rating. The violence is horrendous and graphic. Evil comes at you from all directions and never stops. Premise, plot line, ending . . . dark through and through. How residents of Gotham manage to get through the day without slitting their wrists is a mystery. The Dark Knight was created by dementors. I would never play this DVD with a 13-year-old in the room."
5,Dark knight,"I saw this movie at a Drive In last year, had to have it on DVD. Great show, Heath Ledger was awesome."
5,I'M BATMAN,"Do yourself a favor. Buy this movie immediately. No like right now. Press 'send to cart'. And yet, right now."
3,Wish I bought another version,"This version is okay, but I wish I bought another version. In fact, I'm still contemplating purchasing another version and selling this one. I like that it came with the bonus dvd with extra special features. However, I don't like the general look of the DVD case held inside the bat mask. I feel like the case would break leaving the dvd susceptible to damage. Probably not great for long-term use."
2,"Too much, let me down.","The movie had great action scenes, but it was way too long - they could have cut out about 45 minutes.The movie was too dark, too evil, too twisted (Joker). I just didn't go away feeling Wow! That was a great movie! KL was almost unrecognizable, even creepy in light of his real life demise.No thanks.mdv"
1,Count me out,Sorry but I am not one of the fawning masses who love this movie. It is a mind numbing violent sadist mess. The raves about Ledger's performance are only from sympathy. Aaron Eckhart is completely unbelievable - especially his quick transformation from do-gooder to bad guy. I did like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman though. I was appalled to see all the children in the theater. The movie should have been R rated. After two hours we had enough and walked out. The first Batman remains the best. I know there is talk about others from this same bunch but count me out.
1,Noble Lies: Where Strauss meets Hitler!,"Noble lies...the truth must be manipulated; The masses are NOT to be trusted; You cannot negotiate with ""crazies""; Law and reason is doomed to fail; Wiretapping is necessary; and on and on.... And this one scene I never thought I'd watch in my life time... ...Batman torturing a suspect inside a police interrogation room... One of the most expensive propaganda films of all times! This one star goes for Heath Ledger's performance. A sad and alarming excrement of neoconservative propaganda."
1,posthumous award for most forgettable performance in a trully unecessary movie goes to ...,"Heath Ledger as the Joker ...What we failed to realize that the joke was on us ... this is a script that should have ended up in the trash and not on the screen ...And as for Heath, well it may seem unkind but the only way you could win an award for this performance, in this role, in this movie would be posthumously!I was so bored by this we just turned it off less than half way thru ..."
5,Awesome!!!!!,THis movie wAS THe BEST movie in the universe GO see it !!!!!!and BUY IT BUY IT!!!! worth the mula
3,GREAT MOVIE!!! But Lousy Transfer!,5 STARS for the movie. This is THE GREAT movie of 08. But I'm VERY disappointed in the transfer on the DVD. Muddy picture quality and digiatl artifacts abound. No bonuses what so ever besides the film itself. A modern movie should look much better than this. Warner's quality standards are very poor. Be warned it is not for young children at all.
2,"strange mix of Bond, a mafia movie, and a police procedural","Unfortunately, I went into this movie expecting to see an epic superhero movie. What the movie actually is a fairly dry and boring mix of James Bond (indeed with Morgan Freeman as Q), a mafia movie, and a police procedural. Heath Ledger does a decent job with what script he had to work with, but to be honest this is closer to an episode of NYPD blue than a grand good vs. evil superhero adventure."
2,This really isn't a special thing.,"Very disappointed I bought this movie because it's one of my all time favorites, and it came with the iTunes digital copy. When I tried to put in the code for the digital copy it wouldn't let me, it turned out the code expires, so if your looking to get the digital copy buy it at you local store.Next if you like to watch bonus material, this has none. The only thing special about this set is the steel book case that's all. Otherwise it really isn't a special thing."
3,Good - if you ignore Batman,"Christian Bale does a decent Bruce Wayne, but Batman was awful in this movie. Everything about Batman, from the costume to the voice (especially the voice) is pathetic. However, Heath Ledger's Joker easily makes up for any and all of Batman's disappointments. Overall, the movie has a good story, although slow at times, and an okay cast. I recommend renting this one before buying it."
5,Great movie!,"This is one of the best movies ever. I'm so glad I have on Blue-Ray, hope it will stick around for more years to come. Also, ""Batman Begins"" is a must-have movie."
5,amazing,This is a great movie made better by Blu-ray.The mask is tiny and IS the actual case for the movie. if you like to organize your discs on a shelf then dont buy this as it wont fit in a standard DVD slot.
5,Are you really reading this?!,"Best movie EVER! You really don't have to read reviews of this movie, it rocks across the board. I don't know anyone that did not enjoy this film."
3,Awesome Movie...poor quality,I love this movie. Its one of my favorite movies of all time. So I was GREATLY DISAPPOINTED when the movie began to skip and freeze right in the middle during the climax of the movie. I can't give it below a 3 because the film itself is great.
5,The Dark knght (+BD live),"What can i really say? Everyone knows that dark night is an amazing movie. The video quality on the blu ray is of the best out there. It is so nice to watch in 1080p to see all the detail of the characters costumes. Even if you aren't into it, get it so you can look cool for having it on your shelf."
1,Save $10 DO NOT get 2 Disc!,"I usually LOVE 2 disc special editions. Typically, they have deleted or extended scenes, director commentary, and interviews with the actors.This has NONE of those! The 2nd disc is a waste! No actor interviews, no commentary...all it has is a silly interview with the composer, and some fake ""Gothom Tonight"" shows.Seriously, Heath Ledger gives one of the best villain performances of all times, and there isnt one interview?!?!? Nothing at all. You'd never even realize he was in the movie if you only saw the ""Bonus Disc""Save $10 and just get the single disc...cuz the 2nd disc is nothing more than a coaster.Or, go get Iron Man or Tropic Thunder, which actually had GREAT 2nd discs."
5,Perfect,Really great Batman movie especially for the price/ value. Superhero fans will be extremely pleased and not have many objections
4,Dark Knight DVD,"Better than some in the Batman series, not as good as others.Entertaining nonetheless.Can't beat Blu-ray on true HD 1080p flatscreens."
4,Best of the Batmans,"Both Cristian Bale and Heath Ledger gave outstanding starring performances, with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman also appearing at the top of their craft."
5,Dark Knight is a must own,This movie is amazing! I saw it twice with my fiancee and we placed a pre-order on the blu-ray the day it was available for pre-order. Can't wait to receive the limited edition!
1,"Total waste of time, watch grass grow instead","Total zero. Another of those DARK DARK movies used to cover up the lack of a good clear plot and script. To long, to complex, to confusing, to many scenes with yet another fight where Batman lives. Try to ID the bad guys, it keeps changing. The scenes were all Black and white and to fast paced. Seems aimed only at the youth and pre-teen market who will think it is something new and spectacular because of the high sound volume and lots of useless killing. I tried to give a ""0"" rating but the system required at least 1 star which it does not deserve"
3,movie,this movie actually never came in but i got a full refund no questions ask. So im happy even though something went wrong with my item
3,"Incredible movie, poor shipping","While this movie itself is fantastic and an overall enthralling watch, I was very disappointed with amazon for their delivery of this specific item. I ordered it from them (new) and when the package arrived the dvd box was cracked and broken. This is no way for a brand new item to arrive. I sincerely hope that this never happens again because I have ordered many books and movies from Amazon and have had no previous problems."
5,The Dark Knight DVD review,"wow, thanks, Marzenka - item was just as you described and that was really fast delivery - item arrived today. Thank you!"""
4,Very dark! Hence the title.,"I liked this film and regret that it's filming contributed to the death of Heath Ledger. While many prefer the original Nicholson Joker's TV-series-esque madcap behavior, Mr. Ledger turned in a solid performance of the Killing Joke, Joker. Arguably the best and most terrifying Joker of them all.All this has been said before, but it bears repeating: the cast, direction, and script are all aces. A great snapshot of Batman's true sacrifice and heroism."
5,Good Movie,"The movie was brilliant. i saw it in theaters and loved it, so i thought it would only be right to purchase it in the finest quality available. Great choice, although this movie does not have too many scenes like planet earth that absolutely need 1080p, it still is a great way to watch an amazing film."
5,Best Batman Movie!!!,"I was never in to Batman until I saw Batman Begins, It was Amazing. I then bought the four Batman movies made before Batman Begins. The are all just ok, all the villains in them are a Joker copy, they don't stay true to their comic book characters. Then I saw The Dark Knight, how Christopher Nolan and the other writers write the Joker and how Heath Ledger plays him is what people needed. A different view of the Joker we have never seen, but yet stays true to the comics character. Christian Bale still gives a low voice like the first one, but that doesn't take away from the movie. Batman and Gordon's last speech in the movie is a Great example of self sacrifice by Batman. If you love Batman this is a Must Own. BUY IT FROM AMAZON NOW!!!!!! (One last note, the movie is very dark but that does not take away from it but adds to it.)"
4,The Dark Knight,"It is gripping. An adult film, not for little ones. The two main characters play off each other well. The Joker is more life like and less comic book than the one as Jack Nicholson played it. Both were great, but played entirely from a different point of view. Bat Man was also more real world with technology at his disposal to do things mere mortals could not. Overall very good entertainment. I will not spoil the ending!"
4,"Christmas '08, still at local Blockbusters for 35$","Aside from the regular 2-Disc special edition, this Blockbuster-Exclusive version has a Joker slipcover, and a journal. The slipcover really only functions when the journal and movie remain inside together, so unless you plan to keep your copy of Batman Begins inside as well, it will collapse if stacked with other movies.The journal is just that, an empty journal you can write in. The sleeve in the back has a nice surprise for hardcore fans of the movie. As of December '08, you may still be able to find this available at your local Blockbusters for a little over/under 35$, so don't pay over a hundred on Amazon yet! The sleeve is pretty, but hardly functional."
3,"Digital Copy Expired December 9, 2009","Digital Copy Expired December 9, 2009, I bought this DVD in 2012, while I realize that the price was cut maybe to compensate, It would have been nice if there was at least a disclaimer posted with the display of the product!"
4,disappointed in special features,"What! Where are the Special Features? This DVD should have been packed with interviews, deleted scenes, how the special effects were done, etc. I loved the movie (I've seen it 8 times) but was so looking forward to the DVD's special features. What a let down!"
4,Very Good,"Very Good But not as good as batman begins,everyone is saying how terrific this movie is but its only because of heath ledgers death."
2,The Dark Knight Aint Right!! Great Movie - Sloppy Video,"Beware Poor Video Quality for the Standard Video edition. I thought it was due to having a Rental Copy but Ive read too much about this Title from others with same gripe. Soooo...the way to get me to go Blue-Ray is to release Stanky Versions on Standard Def & Force me to invest more $$ into new player and costlier discs...I don't think so. ""It's not about the Money...It's about sending a Message""..."
5,One of my favorite movies!,"Extremely good! Riddled with action, sinister humor and the internal battle to kill or to show mercy. Heath Ledger is the true star of the movie with his portrayal of The Joker"
5,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!,"This movie is by far the best all time comic movie ever. Heath Ledger (God Bless You, 1979-2008) as the Joker was questionable at first, but once I saw the opening negotiation scene with the mobsters, I was hands down convinced that this was the man for the job, ""Wanna see a magic trick?"". This movie, unlike many other reboots, didn't bore you. In fact, it kept you urning for more. Both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger put on a performance that was exceptional. I hope they reconsider another reboot because Christian Bale as the Dark Knight was perfect. As a fan, I gonna miss Heath Ledger playing the Joker, but I would hate it more if they reboot the whole franchise and try to one up the Joker character with a new actor."
5,Deep and Dark story. Awesome HD pictures,"I'm not a fan of keep remaking batman and joker all the time, but this version of Joker is one of the most brutal villain I've seen in a super hero film. And of course the entire story is dark. I'm not a fan of Hollywood producing too many of these, but nonetheless it's a masterpiece.The picture is sharp in Full HD 1080p on a plasma TV. The surround sound decoded nicely. The extra features are good to give insight. I LOLed looking at the super-sized film reel for the HD recording!Bought it on Amazon during sale. Can't beat the price and a can't miss collector item for enjoying the home theater experience."
3,Dark Knight DVD Review,"The DVD was of good quality. However, the DVD makes noise as it spins inside the DVD player. This is probably due to a poor quality unbalanced DVD that the manufacterer burned to. Buyer beware."
3,The Dark Knight - The movie,Bought it for a firend that is a huge batman fan. I didn't see the package but saw the movie elsewhere. Sorry but I didn't like the movie. The special effect were good but the plot wasn't there. My friend thought it was great.
4,""" Why So Serious?!!!""","Batman is back with a vengeance! Everyone did an awesome job, especially Heath Ledger as the psychopathic Joker! The Joker is both funny and scary. Other than Batman, The Joker was my favorite character! I'm surprised they had Harvey Dent being Two-Face and becoming a bad guy in this movie. I thought they would save him for the 3rd one. If you are hard-core Batman fans, you'll love THE DARK KNIGHT!!!"
3,Digital Copy sold with this Special Edition expired in 2009,We paid over 3 times more to buy the Special Edition that included a downloadable Digital Copy only to find out that the Digital Copy expired in 2009. Amazon originally suggested that we return the item subject to an extra restocking fee because we had opened the package. They recluctantly agreed to refund the difference between the special edition and the basic movie.
3,Just what I expected.,The movie was as good as I expected it to be. The marketing was accurate. The actors were chosen according to their ability. Not a bad movie.
1,Special edition 2 disk............... Don't waste your money,"I was really disapointed with product in more than one way. First off the movie desrves like a million stars but this does not. If you want to buy it save yourself money on the onew disk one because the special features are just a bad joke. So unless you want a digital copy (which I do enjoy) get the one disk. Also this was supposed to arrive on the 10th of decmber it didn't arrive till the 13th, it was only days but 3 days i had to wait longer so the shipping absolutley deserves negative stars just like the special features. But once again do get the one disk edition of the movie because the movie itself is amazing and if i was rating the movie not the product it would have 5 stars not one."
1,Great Movie. Horrible DRM,"If you are thinking about buying the special addition for the ""Digital Copy"" you need to know Warner Brothers are lying to you.I ripped the digital copy to my XP machine. Transferred it to my Vista machine to stream to my 360. Apparently somewhere in that simple transaction, WB decided to DEACTIVATE the digital copy making it completely useless. Who are they kidding?Way to go DRM. I'm getting a refund. Save yourself some money and find this movie through other means."
3,3- Stars for the movie but 2 stars for the DVD,"The Dark Knight, though overrated, is one of the better superhero films we've been treated to. Like so many have said, Ledger's Joker deserves the accolades and kudos he's been getting. He literally steals the entire movie with his maniacal, eccentric and unhinged Clown Prince of Crime. However, the movie suffers from two things, a too-long running time (the last act with Two-Face seems almost tacked on), and being just too damned serious and dark. I know, I know, it's Batman, but even the Dark Knight can lighten it up just a bit. It was so ""realistic"" and ""gritty"" that, at times, Batman himself seemed out of place. The DVD 2-disc special edition was o.k., but could have used more features. How about, AT LEAST, an interview with ONE of the stars??! How about a featurette on designing and building the new suit? Oh well, the film looks great and Nolan deserves plenty of pats on the back for a fine sequel to the superior Batman Begins."
2,Should have ended this movie 30 minutes sooner,"The first 75% of this movie was FANTASTIC !!!Then the director decided to ""extend"" the movie with a stupid ""sub-plot"", i.e., the ""Blame Game"" - who is the villain ??? Is the Joker the villian ?Is Harvey Dent the 'bad guy' ? Is Batman the 'criminal' ? Etc., etc., and so on.Give me a break !!!"
3,3.5 Stars. Good movie but did not live up to the hype....,"First of all, I'm not a fan of ""Batman Begins""- I thought it was a bit silly (ninjas?) and the Batman suit was clunky. However, the buzz on ""Dark Knight"" was so positive that I was prepared to be blown away...didn't happen.Dark Knight has excellent acting and production values. Heath Ledger's performance is extraordinary and he deserved his posthumous Oscar. However, the story is just...ok. It's frankly a bit pretentious (tries to be MEANINGFUL and symbolic of the times), and it falls flat. The dialogue is also silly at times, especially Gordon's closing lines as he sums up why Batman is ""heroically"" sacraficing his reputation so that the dream of Harvey Dent's perfection lives on. Give me a break.Superman (1978) and SpiderMan 2(2004) are still the best superhero movies of all time. This is just good, not great.Oh yeah, the Batman suit is much better this time. But Bale's batman voice is still terrible."
2,"Great Film, but DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE TWO DISC SPECIAL EDITION!","I am not going to waste time talking about the film, as people looking at buying this have already seen it.The two disc is a total waste of money. All you get on the bonus disc are a digital copy of the film(which you don't need if you have ripping software), and really stupid bits about how the composer waited to adapt the film to Heath Ledger's acting(seriously?), a documentary of the making of the new Batman suit(I DON'T CARE), and an especially stupid set of fake CNN clips where ""pundits"" discuss current events happening in the film(really poorly thought out farce). Had I known this is what I would be getting for the extra money, I would NEVER have bought it.WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
2,I didn't like this movie,"I personally did not like this movie at all, but my boyfriend loved it and I know a ton of people love it so much, that it just won many awards at the People Choice Awards 2009, and one of them including ""best movie"". I watched about an hour of it and couldn't watch it anymore cause I didn't like it and didn't seem interesting. A lot of parts in it you can tell are super fake. However, Heath Ledger did an amazing job in this movie. That is the only thing I like about this movie. Sorry. From me to you, I would probably get it since most people love the movie, but I just didn't like it for some reason. And I love most movies like this, yet I never have liked ANY batman movies ever. You make the decision. If you like prior batmans, then you will like it, but if not, then dont waste your time, unless you want to see how Heath Ledger plays an absolutely crazy part in it."
5,Holy Blu Ray Backlash!!!!!!!,"Why would I want a Digital Copy of a Blu-Ray Disc? I just don't get it!!!I was all excited that ""TDK"" is finally coming out on Blu-Ray. But in order to enjoy the experience of BD, why am I forced to have a Digital Copy of any release shoved down my throat. Why not package the digital copy in with the standard definition disc instead, sell it separately or here's a thought...download it from an online site instead?If someone can come up with an reasonable and sound explanation that doesn't involve a lame marketing strategy and how this helps the blu-ray consumer, I'll never post a comment (positive or negative) here ever again."
3,Heath Ledgers movie,"What a loss. When they attempt to re-cast The Joker for the next movie (which they will) some poor SOB has a impossible challenge. Arron was also good, but Ledger should get the Oscar (a award I have had very little respect for recently).The three stars are my impression of the appeal of the whole movie, if edited down (while preserving all of Ledgers screen time) I'd give it a 5 star rating. To be honest, I didn't really see the entire film, the film broke 5 or 6 times (!!??) so we lost several minutes of the movie and the mood was definitely broken. I read in the local paper the next day that in the next town the film actually caught fire on the projector. I suspect the Riddler."
5,Love this movie on Blu!,"This is one of the best movies available for the Blu Ray format. The sound is excellent, and the picture is oh, so sweet. Heath Ledger gives the performance of a lifetime, and unfortunately it would be his last. The re-imagining of Batman by Christopher Nolan is one of the best things, if not THE best, ever to happen to the bat. If you have not seen this movie, do not hesitate! Buy it now! You won't regret it."
3,way too expensive,"I am rating the case only,the movie looks great on blu ray so you should definitley buy the movie on bluray but not with this little plastic addition the motorcycle is very small and very overpriced you should buy this movie on bluray without this."
5,Best Batman Ever !,"What a movie. The 2 1/2 hours felt like 2 1/2 minutes. One of the best movie you will see. for the losers who rated this movie 0 stars, you shouldn't be allowed to write a review as much as those who voted twice for G. W. Bush shouldn't be allowed to vote again!! Go OBAMA"
5,AMAZING!,"as always bat man is amazing, and this movie was full of action. a must have for any comic loving movie lover"
4,Ghetto Mafia's C.D. is a hit,This is one of Ghetto Mafia's best. It is a combination of Blues and Rap to give it a sound like no other. Ghetto Mafia has a style like no other group which keep them on top and unique.
5,Great debut album for GFR,"This cd is rockin'. It's heavy and raw. Too me if you're starting a GFR collection, start with this cd. Unfortunately my first taste of GFR was ""Good singin' good playin"" when I was 15. Although I appreciate that album now, I did not pursue anymore gfr for another 11 years. Too me GFR's best cd's are there first 4 (on time, GFr (aka the red album), survival, and E.Pluribus funk). After that they lost there identity, becoming more of a progressive and pop band. My favorite songs on this CD are ""are u ready"", ""T.N.U.C"" and ""time Machine"". Pure straight ahead rock and blues."
1,A popular but inept imitation of Cream,"I have the original vinyl recording. Basically, this band rode the hype created by power trios such as Cream and Hendrix. As opposed to those two bands, this band plods along from the opening set to the dull, boring, leaden last cut with its clunky exchange between Mark Farner and Mel Schacher, to the lifeless backbeat by Brewer. Mark Farner's playing is easily imitable by dozens oflocal garage bands, he seems to revel in cutting virtually every solo from the E-minor chord. Best player is Don Brewer, the drummer, but his pyrotechnic drumming is no complement to the soulless noise one suffers through on this record.If you must get this reissue CD, be forewarned- unless you really like these obnoxious louts."
3,Typical for its time,"It was OK but knowing that Roddenberry was the creator of this non-starter series I was hoping for more. All about an exploration team in a post-apocalyptic future and a mission to a matriarchial society, Planet Earth has the feel of a sci-fi series episode or a made-for-TV movie. With time it might have developed better character development and a more coherent plot line. Still, it's good for what it is."
3,a typically TV Sci-Fi from the 70s,"This is not a big movie production a la ""Logan's Run"". The movie was made for TV but with a great actor John Saxon (he was the only reason that I bought this DVD).This Product, the DVD is so far OK. Picture quality is very good. Of course, not restored / remastered and could be better. The only minus point I have - like with all Warner Brothers Archive Collections - the DVD has no subtitles"
5,SONY and Columbia Tristar --- RELEASE MARY HARTMAN ON DVD,"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman was an awesome series when it first aired in 1976. It ran for 325 episodes and was a soap-opera parody as well as a legitimate soap-opera in its own right. It was unbelievably popular during its initial run and became a pop-culture phenomenon. It was definitely Norman Lear's most popular show, surpassing All in the Family in notoriety when it debuted on syndicated TV. But for some reason that I fail to understand SONY Pictures and Columbia Tristar will not release this classic series on VHS or DVD. At least we have the two volumes of The Best of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman to remind us how well-done this show was. But the 6 episodes included on these tapes are just a tease. Come guys at SONY!!! You're sitting on a gold mine. Bring back Mary Hartman. It is long overdue."
2,wobbly,"These are suppose to be stabilizers, but they rock back and forth since the nut fits loosely in the stand. If the nut was larger then I could see these working properly."
4,captivating,I found the movie very interesting. Movies never follow the book to a tee. The actors and actresses were superb. I enjoyed each and every one of the characters(no problem with nicollette). Jackie comes through once again. I recommend it. It leaves you yearning for more.
1,I got the bad egg,"My boss had one of these that he let me borrow for a culinary competition. I have used many hand held blenders to include the cuisinart and kitchenaid versions which I own, but this blows them away. It is the only mini blender that I've seen that will actually fully puree carrots into a nice cohesive sauce (with the food processor attachment. The other brands left tiny granular chunks in it. I was actually quite impressed with the set and looking to buy one for myself until about the fourth time using it when the plastic above the blade attachment melted to the shaft of the food processor unit, transforming it into a piece of useless junk. He hadn't used it more than a dozen times, so wear and tear should not have been an issue. Regardless, I had to buy him a new one, and I therefore will never trust anything from Braun again despite the fact that this was clearly a fluke. I don't know if this has happened to anyone else with this product, but I'm not willing to take my chances."
1,Should have known better!,I took a chance on this cd and lost. I should have known better. The cd is completely spoon-feed material. If you are excited about your last purchase of Summer Ibiza Hits than this cd may be for you. This cd smacks of commerical dance music with stolen elemnts of the progressive house/trance sound. Some of the transitions are as smooth as gravel.
3,SOUND,"I REALLY LIKE THE FEATURES THIS CAMCORDED HAS. I LIKE ALL THE SPECIALEFFECTS. HOWEVER, UNLIKE THE OLDER MODELS(CC421 AND OTHERS OF THISAGE) IT DOES NOT HAVE A SOUND BLOCKER. WE ATTEND PARTIES THAT HAVEEXTREMELY LOUD MUSIC(WE HAVE A VERY LARGE FAMILY PLUS A NUMBER OFEXTENDED FAMILY SO WE ATTEND AT LEAST 3 OR 4 PARTIES A MONTH AND WEARE THE ""OFFICAL"" PHOTOGRAPHERS) AND ON THE NEW CAMCORDERSTHE SOUND IS TERRIBLE. IF YOU COULD FIND A WAY TO PUT A FILTER ON THESOUND LIKE THE OLDER MODELS HAVE, I WOULD GLADLY BUY THIS NEWMODEL....MAXINE MORENO"
1,Terrible!,"I was recommended by a friend to read this book, and I am never, ever listening to her advice again! This was a terrible piece of ""prose""! Shallow and poorly written, like a screenplay rejected from a bad soap opera pilot. Audrey, the protagonist, is a horribe wife, a horrible mother, and so lifeless and unreal that you want her to be slapped and locked up instantly!I couldn't finish the book, because with each chapter came more and more badly written storylines that failed to capture my attention. They did garner a lot of laughter from me and the other friends I've shown this piece of trash to.Save yourself the horror and read something else! The book reads like something a high schooler with no literary backround or skill in creative writing would produce."
5,Encore! Encore!,"I didn't want this book to end, and when the ending came, I had to read it again when I was more calm to get the details. Spirson sets up the suspense on Page one and boy does she deliver. I laughed and cried. It's an easy and fun read with heartwrenching truths and thoughtprovoking issues about woman and jealousy and life and marriage. I can see why USA Today raved. It made me more careful of every little decision I make, because it all adds up. Buy this book!"
2,over bored,"i purchased this book for my kids, who are fans of the current overboard comic we see in the newspaper each day. I did not realize how much the comic has evolved since its early days. These older comics in the book are crudely drawn and there is very little character development. I'm glad the current version of the series is so much better, but I wish that I had known this before I bought this old book. It is time for a new release I think"
5,Excellant,"Finally, Americans are unshackled from the political myth and spin doctored history of the Kennedy clan and their admirers. Hersh is not the hero, the courageous individuals who were willing to tell the truth are, notwithstanding Hersh's meticulous investigative research. Few will gain financially from this book; Americans will gain enomously from a more accurate historical record."
2,Half a diary of a madman,"A good Ozzy biography is long overdue. Unfortunatly this is not it. The main text is sadly lacking in details including places and events. Ozzy's headlining show at the Donnington Monsters of Rock (16th Aug '86) doesn't get a mention and neither does his performance at the Port Vale festival (1st Aug '81) where he famously stood in for Black Sabbath. Almost crimainally, Ozzy's second guitarist, Jake E. Lee doesn't even receive a name check and is passed off as ""...the first decent player that came along.""Positive notes? The discography section at the back is wonderfu. It's just a shame that the rest of the book is not as well researched."
2,Shallow,"OF course this book is shallow. It don't comment about Ozzy pals, the vreative process in Black Sabbath or his solo records, about Zakk Wylde, Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley, Tony Iommi, sales figures,nothing."
1,Another defective Waterpik WP-65,From the start mine has worked only intermittently. Very frustrating.
2,poor quality,"Noisy, and does not tolerate addition of mouthwash to the water. Unit failed after about 2 months. Contacted Waterpik who advised me not to use mouthwash in the flosser tank because there is a materials issue involving a gasket that swells because of the mouthwash ingredients . Ridiculous, I had another brand for several years with no mouthwash issues. Waterpik sent me a replacement part which I installed . I should not have to deal with a product that has gross limitations. Will never purchase a waterpik product again!"
1,Loud and lousy,"'would give 0 star if possible...This item is the worst product I have ever bought at Amazon. After just 3 days, it starts giving very loud noise -- as loud as a lawn-mower .I am trying to cope with the noise until it broke and stopped working. Now, I have a broken item with just more than 30-days old -:(... do not know what to do ....."
4,Waterpik Classic,This is sooo much better than the cordless one I bought first. This product is just like the Waterpiks that I have been using for years. It works!!
2,Undeliverable,Product was unable to be delivered and returned to sender. I will try to purchase it some place else.
1,lemon for lemmings,"This is a perfect description of what this product has become and the people who use them. After purchasing two battery charged water piks, the first was an Inter-Plak, and having them both die within weeks, I looked at the comments and found everyone has the same problem. What's worse is that the nickel cadmium battery can't be thrown out without environmental harm, they have to be returned to a qualified dealer. Of course, most people probably don't do this so these companies are not only defrauding their customers, they are spoiling the enviornment with disposable products that can't be safely disposed.I just bought the model that attaches to the shower. Don't know how it will work out, but it won't burn out. It won't foul the environment. It doesn't use electricity and it won't clutter my counter. Its considerably cheaper. It seems like the way to go, doesn't it?"
2,Waterpik WP-65,"I have been using this product for the nth time and was quite satisfied with it until recently when it came in with a new design style. It used to look sturdy and more stable when placed in a countertop, now it is so lightweight, nosier and the material used looks cheap. Even the design has been modified. If i were based in the United States, I could have returned the product but since I have to bring it home with me to my home country, the Philippines, I have no choice but get stucked with it. Frankly, it's quite a disapointment."
4,wp-20,this was a replacement for a wp-20 that died from old age 15+ years it works as expected but i liked the wp-20
5,Wish this were available in stores!,"Excellent product - I just wish I could buy it locally! My wife and I have had one for years and the kids have used ours. Now the kids finally have one of their own. Using this regularly reversed the gingivitis gum disease we were experiencing. Now our mouths are healthy. Plus, this is really the only ""realistic"" way for our kids to floss around their braces on a daily basis!"
1,Don't buy this,Hard to get the resevoir to seal and to get the fluid to flow and now the motor runs w/out creating pressure. Get something else.
1,Last 5 weeks,This waterpik stopped pumping out water after 5 weeks and used a few times. It is still under a two year warranty. I returned to a local repair shop who told me they don't repair this equipment but return it to Waterpik who should send me a new one. I don't expect much reliability from the device. If it was within the 30 day period after shipment I would return it for a refund. Don't get stuck with this product like I am.
5,Replacement,"I bought this to replace a much older waterpik that finally died. This seems to work well, was fairly priced and hopefully will last as long as the last one did."
5,The Mouse and The Motorcycle,"Have you ever woundered what it would be like to have a mouse as a friend that talks?Well than you should read the book ""The Mouse and The Motorcycle.""""The Mouse and The Motorcycle"" is about a mouse that likes to go on adventures.He is pretty cool.In the book he risked his life for a little boy (Kid) that is sick. But on the way Ralph (The Mouse) runs into trouble and some are dangerous. I know he is excellent and that is why I would like you to read this book(""The Mouse and The Motorcycle"")and see the adventures Ralph (The Mouse) gose on!! (By:Jenna Witczak)"
5,The Mouse and the Motorcycle,"I just finished a great Beverly Cleary book! The name was The Mouse and the Motorcycle. I give it 5 stars! I've read all three stories of Ralph, and I think this is the best one yet! It all started when Keith left his motorcycle on the bedside table. Ralph climbed the telephone cord and hopped on the motorcycle. He could only move it with his feet. Then suddenly the telephone rang! The only thing Ralph could do was ride off the edge. He lands in the trashcan where Keith finds him. He lets Ralph ride the motorcycle until he lost it in a hamper of linen. Then Keith gets sick, so Ralph finds his way to the Ground Floor. Then he finds an aspirin under the dresser. When Keith is leaving, Matt brings the motorcycle back! Keith says Ralph can keep it! He hides the motorcycle under the TV set. I think this is a great book.(...)"
5,My favorit Movie,"Of all the movies I have seen in my entire life, this is my favorite movie, I highly recommend this movie to everyone, I collect DVD's, this should have been one of the first movies on DVD. I hope this will happen very soon. I laugh everytime I watch it."
1,Works perfectly... eventually,"It does what it's supposed to... after 1/2 to 1 second delay per keystroke. This doesn't sound like much but hold volume up for a couple of seconds and watch your receiver... -30... -29... -28... -27... and then it keeps going, louder and louder s l o w l y well after you've released the button, the show has ended, you've come back from the bathroom... you get the idea."
2,Too complicated,"This is a slick looking device which is programmed by downloading software and entering model numbers of the hardware you want to control. In my case that was a Samsung LCD TV, a Sony Blue-Ray player, a DirecTV high def receiver and a Panasonic Surround-sound system DVD - videotape player. The first three seemed to work OK, but not the fourth, which I use strictly for sound.Best Buy says they can make an appointment and get it to work, but, in addition to the expense, I work and am not willing to take time off for that purpose. I think it's ridiculous that Logitech is allowed to advertise a ""plug and play"" product when it is anything but that."
1,was not what I wanted,"nothing wrong with it, it wasn't right for the application I needed-so I returned it and ordered a n ir repeater"
5,Does what it's supposed to do,"A great device -- I use it in conjunction with my Logitech Harmony 1100 remote. Between the two of them it was pretty easy to get control of my home entertainment system when the door to the system is closed (which is how I like it, seeing as how the cabinet which holds it is so pretty)."
4,NOT A-DOOR-ABLE,"THIS IS YOUR TYPICAL CAMCORDER. IT WORKS FINE. THE ANIMATION FEATURE IS NOT THE KIND YOU'D WANNA MAKE A CARTOON OR CLAYMATION WITH, BECAUSE IT ONLY GOES AS LOW AS A QUARTER OF A SECOND PER SHOT. THE 20X ZOOM IS GOOD, AND THE COMPACT SIZE IS ALSO GOOD. THE ONE BAD THING ABOUT THIS CAM IS THAT IT HAS A DOOR PANEL LATCH THAT IS WEAK. YOUR SUPPOSED TO CLOSE IT BY PUSHING A BUTTON, NOT BY SNAPPING IT. IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY UNHOOK THE PLASTIC LATCH, YOU'LL HAVE A CAMCORDER IN WHICH YOU'LL HAVE TO TAPE THE DOOR/PANEL CLOSE."
1,It was a hard read...,"""It was a read so bad that it made an eye chart look like an award winning novel..."" Anyone who loves hack writing and horrible prose in the fashion of old pulp detective novels will adore this book.If on the other hand, you are looking for another excellent science fiction story written in the STNG world of culture and intelligent dialog, you should avoid this book at all costs. The story idea itself is bottom-of-the-barrel ""first season"" quality. The treatment (or lack thereof) of the STNG characters is embarassing. It's truly the most awful book I've ever read and you couldn't pay me enough money to suffer through it again."
2,Not a good read.,"I don't usually criticize Star Trek books because I can usually find something to like about them. Not this one. It's poorly written and inconsistent. It's written in 2 styles, that of a pulp mystery from the 1940s and in ""real time"" as a Captain's log. It's difficult to figure out what is going on at first. An object has been stolen, one that is needed to save the ship. It's obvious from almost the beginning who has stolen the object and you'll probably guess right away, but you have to slog through this awful book to find out if you''re correct. It's all one big misdirection and not a very good one. Skip this one, even if you're a die-hard STNG fan."
1,Terrible,"Comparing this group and album to Cream? Are you kidding? I listened to this albumrecently for the first time in over 25 years, and if I hear it again in the next 25 years, itwill be too soon. Totally uncreative songs, vocals and solos. Headache- inducing at anyvolume level. Groups like this give rock music a bad name."
5,A Classic,"I cannot say enough good things about this book. It is not just a window into the Earth, but a window into the sources of organic compounds in carbonaceous meteorites, the early history of ""Fox Holes"" in the asteroid parent bodies, even the conditions on (and under) Mars - to say nothing of Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus, Titan, and beyond. Some of his ideas are downright creepy, but as every one of his colleagues will attest, during his lifetime Thomas Gold has been right about too many creepy things to ever be dismissed out of hand."
4,"A must-read for any ""fossil"" fuel consumer","Gold convincingly presents his case for a primordial origin of petroleum (coal, oil, gas) fuels in this easy to read volume. I am amazed that, at the age of 36, I am just now hearing his theories.To those who choose to dismiss his thesis, I ask you to present your own, more plausible argument. As scientists require that experimental results be successfully replicated before ""buying into"" a theory, the fact, as Gold states it, that no oil, coal or diamonds have been produced in the laboratory according to the ""compressed and heated organic matter"" theory, greatly supports his argument that these materials have an abiogenic origin.If true, the raw material costs for these fuels collapses, completely changing the industries' business models and, on the flip side, reinvigorates the need for pollution and greenhouse gas controls as consumption no doubt will increase."
3,Pretty Good but not his best,"I used to really dig Ice Cube before he went WestSide Crazy to the point he became a coined Phrase.this album has solid Production&you vibe on the Lyrics.songs Like It was a Good Day &Wicked with Das Efx also Check yo self are standouts.but this isn't on par with Amerikkka's Most Wanted.he became more&more watered down with each new release and hasn't been the same.He is a Legend in the Game, but no Longer The Trailblazer he once was."
3,Pretty good sample,This CD is a pretty good sample of the hits of the Drifters. But there is a more complete anthology out there. For the average fan it is worth the price.
5,A Good Alternative to Other Drifters Compilations,"This CD cuts to the heart of the Drifters' hits from the time when another group headed by Ben E. King was annointed by Atlantic Records to replace the Clyde McPhatter-era group who had its own successes but was disbanded reputedly over money squabbles. They were renamed the Drifters as Atlantic owned the name. (Johnny Moore from the original group would later emerge as the lead singer of the ""new"" Drifters due to the departure or death of other lead singers). There is no filler in this package, and it includes ""Sweets for My Sweet"" not included in many other Drifters' compilations. This may be the one you want. Right for the price."
3,External flash reader at Target!,I was reading the reviews for the CDS4100 and someone wanted to know where toget the external. I got one at Target with multiple card ports. My problem is that I formatted the card in XP and now my camera doesnt read the card. How do i fix that?
1,Crap,"Bad movie. Poor script, poor acting, poor directing, and even worse sound. At one point an old timer tells a kid to ""Go back into the motel."" This is a Western set in 1874. The word 'motel' was not invented until sixty years later. The actor should have said, ""Go back into the house."""
2,Good book written poorly,"I bought this book in hopes of using it to design a good intranet portal for our company. The book is written poorly and doesn't really help you implement the modules discussed in the book. I have tried countless times to implement what was discussed in the book but the code never works, I am using the code which was downloaded from the publisher's website so it should work according to their instructions. Another downside is the author no longer supports the code in the book so if problems happens you are on your own, I would think a publisher would support their own code and be able to answer questions about it. Needless to say I am extremely disappointed with the book, I had high hopes for it but it just didn't work the way it should have."
3,"worthwhile, but be warned","Nice collection of music, most of which was new to me. I found their Rhapsody in Blue a bit too stylized at times - for example the sudden rubato in the foxtrot section. Their technique is more than adequate, but they play some of the ornamental fioraturas and cadenzas in an oddly mechanical way. Interesting and listenable none the less, it's a hard piece to which to bring an original interpretation. They really show their savvy and mastery in the dazzling Scaramouche by Milhaud. I loved the Poulenc pieces, especially the moving Elegie.I don't have any complaints about the the recording technique itself, but in several tracks there are minor but distracting digital pops, tears and glitches. Not sure if this happened on the recording tape or CD mastering, but it's unfortunate. There are occasional audience noises, too."
2,i'm made mistake,clear display but bad play valu and very bad conteroling the game was was wrong choise i don't recommend any body to buy it exept childern
3,Great graphics but not such a great game.,"This is the first ridge racer I have played. The graphics are great the cars and tracks look awesome, but, The gameplay is boring. I understand this game is about drifting, but the cars slide so much that you cant really control the drift. It makes it hard to play. If you turn the car around and go the other way and try to hit the other racers the game can be quite fun, it seems nearly impossible to win races. When I started ""career mode"" know as the ""Ridge State Grand Prix"" It says there are 13 race groups the last of which is the championship. At first I thought that this game would be easy, but As I raced the first race and the drifting, I realized that this game was really difficult.I guess I was expecting a typical racing game....As always this is my opinion. Rent the game and try it for yourself."
1,I hate this game,"dont buy it. it sucks. its a bit too late to do a refund now tho, oh well, something to keep some kids entertained. If you like these ridge racer games, go for it, I just dont like the set up and whatnot"
4,Still moving in circles...,"It's a fun game. If your looking for a game with realistic handling and great and vast selection of cars; you might look elsewhere. I think this game is great for the anyone that isn't ready to drive but has an idea. Also this game is for those that fell in love with the franchise from the fourth installment from way back from the first playstation. I like it, hopefully you will too."
2,"Very biased, but why?","He makes no attempt to be impartial and obviously has a bone to pick with Dr. Chatters. Mr. Downey seems quite suspect of all scientists and scientific institutions, to the point of coming off as bitter. I also must second those who have said that questioned Mr. Downey's research. He briefly discussed the Smithsonian Institution's interest in NAGPRA, but he failed to mention (maybe because he was unaware of it) the National Museum of the American Indian Act. SI is governed by the NMAI Act (1989), not NAGPRA (1990). This is just one of a number of omissions and misrepresentations. I would recommend Dr. Chatters' book Ancient Encounters instead of or to balance out this bookd. At least you know Dr. Chatters' stake in the Kennewick case."
1,Very cheap quality,"This is very over priced. It is extremely cheap , the nibs are not even brass, they feel like tin. The holder is not standard. I have never seen this type of holder before. No other nibs will fit. The paper is very inferior, you can even see the glue spots on the envelopes and they are dirty. This isn't even for kids, you don't want them handling the ink. pass on this."
4,Real life account,"I assigned this book to my college students for a closer glimpse of the Vietnam Conflict. I had not read it before, but had done research and study on the subject. I found Caputo's book to be insightful, controversial and thought provoking. He doesn't glamorize the war but explains how it effected soldiers and one of the many reasons it was such a mess. Throughout the book, Caputo shows how the conditions changed the average American teenager into a robotic killer and how their experiences stayed with them. In the end, he speaks against the war, but not in the normal Jane Fonda version of bashing the military and labeling them rapists and baby killer. Caputo talks about how the government was at fault and created the situations that lead to PTSD and other issues for returning soldiers.A must read to understand the war and its effects on our soldiers."
5,Accurate account,"A friend is mentioned in the book. While he does not share Caputo's views on the war, he said it was an accurate, truthful desription of their time in Vietnam.Book is boring, not much for those who want action stories.The friend is one of those on R&R;."
5,Eye-opening,"An enlightening, and touching, account of the Vietnam War, by a man who was there from the beginning to the end. One of the best books I've ever read."
1,Something lost in the revisions,This textbook attempts to be user-friendly to business students who may not have a strong math background but there are serious problems:1. About half the worked-out examples in the text are wrong.2. About half the solutions provided for exercises are wrong.3. The expository material is needlessly complicated.4. Far too few examples are provided.
5,"Awesome! fast, heavy, thrashy","The gathering took the heaviness of demonic with the energy of the legacy.While a very solid album overall - one of the best in the thrash metal genre, this time they had good production but as James Murphy rejoined the band a bit late, there weren't too many solos despite having a more than capable guitar duo."
3,"Video was great, product quality was awful,","Obviously Thirller is a great movie and Michael is a great dancer. However this is not about a movie about dancing although there are various clips like ""beat it"" and of course the complete ""Thriller"" itself. There is lots of background on John Landis and Michael Jackson which is interesting. Our copy came from Galaxy Entertainment very rapidly HOWEVER be aware that the video is of extremely technical quality - the sound and the image was awful and the tracking was *terrible* - lots of static."
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!,"I am deeply disappointed in this rip off! The listing said that it was in ""Nearly New Condition"" Ya!! The tape was scratchy and it stopped playing half way through. We couldn't even watch the whole thing. I contacted amazon to complain, nothing was done. Last time I do business with this company.BUYER BEWARE!!!"
4,I don't like football but I liked this book.,"I thought this book would be an auto-biography but it turned out to be a motivational book AND an auto-biography (two for one!). I just wanted to comment, for anyone like me who doesn't particularly enjoy football or well-known football players, that I enjoyed this book in spite of that. Besides being interesting, it's also entertaining and funny. When I decided to read it I thought I'd probably give up on it before I finished it. I was wrong. If you're undecided about reading it, I strongly recommend that you do. I don't think you'll be sorry."
5,Her best book by far,"This is Katz at her best. All her other sequels are cute but don't measure to the quality of her first book. I have the entire collection and am sure if boxed together in sets of more than 3, they'd fly off the shelf"
4,Fun book,"This book is fun for my 8 month old. He has learned where to flip the pages up or down and enjoys playing with the folds. The paper does usually return to its usual spot, but could be more sturdy (that's why I gave 4 stars rather than 5.)"
2,This guy needs to get a clue!,I don't know where this guy was when the trial was going on but he must have his head stuck somewhere very dark! I truly believe that this book was written just to get his name in print since he did not make it on the defense team! There is not one thing new in this book only the author looks at everything differently than most of the world! This one is not worth reading.
1,As phony as Scott's faux diplomas!,"Fortunately the jury found, quite correctly, that Scott Peterson is guilty of committing these heinous crimes. This particular book is poorly written, contains many factual errors & bizarre suppositions, & is really not worth the time or the money. The few positive reviews surely must have been penned by the Peterson family, or else by Scott's very few remaining groupies. Bottom line......not at all a ""glorious"" book."
1,Don't waste your money,"I find it incredulous that Matt Dalton even wrote this book. This case lasted almost two years and he was involved, for what, a month, maybe two. Mr. Dalton, the reading public, people in general and the jury are not stupid enough to believe the ""satanic cult"", homeless people and people trying to frame Scott theories you throw around. It is an insult to people's intelligence! Did you forget that Scott told Amber he ""lost"" his wife and the same day went out and bought a boat. Was it just coincidence that Laci and Connor were found in the exact location he went ""fishing""? Luckily I didn't waste my own money on this book since I read a friend's copy and had no desire to even finish it. I am looking forward to reading Sharon Rocha's book!"
4,Boni Opus 2,"Pietro Giuseppe Gaetano Boni composed his twelve Opus 1 sonatas for cello and twelve Opus 2 Divertimenti for an ensemble of instruments in the early years of the 18th century. Both were published in Rome in 1717. Boni's music shows the influence of Corelli. Boni moved from Bologna to Rome in 1711 with a letter of recommendation to Corelli. He may or may not have been a student of Corelli's when he composed these divertimenti.This recording of all of the Opus 2 divertimenti employs violin, viola, flute and harpsicord as well as two different mandolins. The liner notes identify Dorina Frati, mandolino, and Daniele Roi, clavicembalo, but not the other performers. Their interpretation follows Boni's printed page with necessary adaptations (e.g., the two different mandolins).Boni: Diverimenti per Camera Op 2 (with mandolin) /Frati * Roi"
5,Cool Camcorder,"I purchased this camcorder for my Mother for Mother's Day. She found it extremely easy and practical to use. We made tons and tons of home movies and sent them to the rest of our family. It helped us all connect more. We've had this camcorder now for 2 years, and it still works well for us everytime there's something we never want to forget."
4,Kalahari Red Tea,"This type of tea you have to get used to the taste, it definitly had a different flavor but I was able to enjoy it because it had Chamomile in it also."
2,An add?,"I took a class on [...] and found it a waste of time and money. The instructors gave me and every other student the same glowing feedback that in no way will help one improve. I bought this book looking for practical advice on some day starting a photography business and found it was a 350 page ad for [...]! Many (if not all) of the people in the book are from betterphoto. The author is a betterphoto instructor. She sites endlessly betterphoto student work and teachers. To top it off, the advice wasnt that helpful, the photos were not inspiring at all. I felt like it was just selling fluff. Good thing I didnt take the course and spend 10 times as much!"
4,Looks like a good intro,"I'm very new to online investing, and bought this book from my local bookstore. I just found it here to send a copy to my sister. It it seems like a very comprehensive introduction to the investment resources available on the internet without bias towards any one method of investing over another. However, the author doesn't hesitate to tell which resources he has personally found to be more usefull in the past and why. I took a quick look at the first 25 books Amazon listed in this category and didn't find anything I'd consider sending instead."
2,It's Just Not Roots,"I'm sorry, Max, but you just can't cut it alone. Sepultura still lives on. Although their music is a painful shadow of what they were once capable of, they are still striking out in new musical directions. However, all three of Soulfly's albums are poor rehashes of the innovations found on Roots. It gets boring. Plus, the guitar is much less in quality than Andreas Kisser's playing of long ago. The tribal rhythms are laughable compared to Igor Cavalera's work on Chaos A.D. or Arise, much less Roots. I found enough heart to give this, Soulfly eponymous release, 2 stars because Max hasn't tried rapping or including 50 guest singers...yet."
1,no...,there's so many lyrics from the Bible...no... this isn't suitable for heavy metal! the vocals are good but the lyrics are riffs are terrible!
2,2 1/2 Stars,"I won't go into all of the Sepultura/Max Cavalera history in this review, as most of the other reviews have that well covered.This album was rushed to make it out to the stores before Sepultura (Mark II) could put something out first, and the haste shows. Many of the songs are repetitious and devolve into (half baked) World music jams. When listening to more recent Soulfly albums and Sepultura's Roots, it is obvious how slap dash this record is. Especially with ""The Song Remains Insane"" which is a sloppy and horrible retread of Sepultura's ""Attitude"" from the Roots album.There are some saving graces though, as ""Eye For and Eye"" and ""No Hope No Fear"" are solid efforts, and the superb drumming of Roy Mayorga (Most recently filling behind drums for Sepultura and currently behind the kit for Stone Sour) hold a few of these songs together.When compared to Soulfly's (Most recent) ""Dark Ages"", and Sepultura's ""Dante XXI"" this album falls flat."
4,Great Music!,Good Music but to loud at some times. I like that the music gets me going in the morning when I am tired.
4,New Millennium Tribal War,"These days there are a lot of good solid metal bands, but very few original acts. Soulfly defies this tradition and comines two musical dimensions that are very far apart yet blend seamlessly. In fact, this could even be considered a higher form of metal, since metal music has a tendency to resonante with the primal instincts of the soul, and Soulfly's tribal elements intensify that resonance. This CD is absolutely primitive fury and has a raw, savage feel. However, this does not mean it's poorly produced or executed. There is a curious complexity in the blistering guitar riffs and thundering drums, which often combine the kit with jungle percussion. It doesn't feel as ""dark"" as most metal, but it abounds with savage energy that is refreshing and inspiring. This is by far their best album, although all of their releases are well worth the $$. Their live show is nothing short of amazing- don't pass up a chance to see them."
4,Oh come on!!!,"This album wasn't that bad. I like it. Even throught it's not Sepultura, but it's ok. And the God thing, He lost a son so, maybe it's his way of saying that his son is somewhere in a better place, that's all. I do have to agree with that him bring in Limp Bizcut guy (Fred) did mess up the album, plus Chino Moreno and him could have done a better song together. But all in all, not a bad album."
2,Have I heard this before?,"If you like paying money for the same thing twice buy the mediocre album. I did. I also feel real stupid about it. This cd should be called Roots 2. ""Against"" is much better than this. What went wrong Max?"
1,WEAK WEAK WEAK,"This album blows. All it is, is a weak rehash of Sepultura's ""Roots"" album. It sounds like a ""Roots"" B-side album, but unfortunately, instead of Igor, Andreas, and Paulo, Max has recruited some very subpar musicians. I love Sepultura, and while I wish they could have kept the original lineup, I would much rather listen to their new album, ""Against"", than to Soulfly. It is just plain boring."
5,Good Stuff,"First of all if you have heard sepultura before, this is very similar(especially to there roots album). The difference is the music seems alot more powerful, but at the same time a little slower and a lot less intense.I guess you could say Soulfly's music sounds alot like music from Mudvayne and Slipknot(Alot of good Screaming with less focus on Impressing us with musical talent). Anyways its cool how Soulfly has some great tribal beats and Max is still really, really good at screaming his guts out.I recomend experiencing sepultura first before getting this c.d. Other than that, this is Soulfly's best album with so many good songs like ""Bleed"" ""Umbabarauma"" and my Favorite ""Eye For An Eye"".It's definitely A metal album you will enjoy. You'll be dancing around that totem pole you carved and put in the middle of your room for hours!"
3,Brasilias own Max Cavalera and thats about it,"I think that Max Cavalera is a perfect example of a rock star. Starts out in a band and once it gets really big,he goes on to a solo career. Yet he is a much more talented artist than, say Fred Durst (who appears on this album) his band isnt very talented. Dont get me wrong, I do like alot of the songs. Eye For An Eye is just terrifying with its creepy tribalistic interlude. But the rest of the album is just down-tuned guitars. Hopefully Max will find some better guitarists and a good drummer if he wants to start a solo career. Me, Im sticking with good ol' Sepultura."
5,"24"" scissor jack",I ordered the Camco scissor jack pack of 2 to replace one of my scissor jacks that was locked up. I am so happy with how heavy duty they are that I ordered 2 more to replace all 4 of mine with these. very happy with this purchase!!
1,It was really sick,If you like pictures that show wall to wall gore this is for you.But it is not for me.
4,A Brief Review,"Okay,so there's been a lot of griping about the ""Shooting Star"" manga series,when the truth is it's not such a bad series.Of course anyone who is interested in getting into the Bebop franchise, shouldn't go to ""Shooting Star"" first.In fact this is probably the last Bebop thing you should explore.With all the said,I think the only flaw with the series are some of the personality changes,but they are slight,and I'll let it go, since this just a ""What if?"" alternate reality/universe-type situation.The characters designs are also quite different,but I think it fits the whole alternate-universe feel of the manga series.So if you've watched the series,the movie, read other manga series then check this series out.You may be in for a pleasant surprise(or not)"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Over-ethical bounty hunting can be hard work.In a diaspora situation the police have little of coping with the crime situation over such a large area, so bounty hunters are quite popular. The ones that aren't too fussy about dead or alive tend to make more money, which leaves the Bebop crew struggling.Supergenius crimelord doubles, computer brained dogs and annoying alien girls don't really help."
4,Always a plus when the soundtrack lends itself to the mood,"I enjoyed Dark City as a film and work of science fiction. I appreciate the score, available as a soundtrack on CD, because it lends itself so well to the mood of this film. This is one soundtrack you want in your CD collection. Most notably Anita Kelsey singing Sway, but the orchestral pieces are great too."
5,Another great album from America's unsung pop gods,"The Connells are one of the best bands in the country and Still Life assures they still have it. The Leper is my favorite track but the album is strong and is enjoyable throughout. In today's corporate radio culture, The Connells put those one-hit-wonder bands to shame. This is a must-have for any true music fan."
4,"Three top notch songs, three good, and three week","I've been a fan of the Connells for years and am always on the lookout for new material by them. This album has three songs that I would put up against any of their greatest material from Fun & Games, One Simple Word, and Ring. Three of the songs are good listening material, though nothing special, and three are weak. Overall that makes for a positive effort and a good addition to a Connells collection."
5,Great find for Moffo fans,"Finally, a decent Moffo recital disc has been released. Recorded in her glowing prime, all the arias are flawlessly sung. My favorite track is Ah! je ris from Faust, but really they are all outstanding. If you love Moffo, you'll ove this cd."
1,Childish piece of work,I am shocked that this book got so many great reviews. The plot was extremely contrived. There were so many repetitions of dialogues. The sex scenes were so long-winded I found myself skipping paragraphs. This was my first book by this author and I'm not going to pick up another in a hurry.
2,liberace vhs,"very poor picture and voice, i didn't send it back because it would of cost more to ship it back than it was worth"
3,"Perhaps the Original, But No Longer the Best","First, you have to have a lot of respect for Charlie Papazian's place in the re-birth of the modern homebrew movement. Lot's of groundbreaking work, writing, and evangelizing. However, I find this book dated in techniques and, to be honest, I really dislike buying a book that's printed on newspaper stock (or just one step up from that). Plus, organizationally, the book bounces around too much. Still, the recipes are good and the information isn't wrong. I'm not sorry I bought it but it's not my go to reference for anything."
3,it was ok,"sence i had wanted this movie for so long and did not want to spend the money on something that i could olny find 1 review on,i wanted to leave one because my courousity got me and i bought it.first i thought it was not bad but alot of close up sceans . i thout the costumes were good.and the actors wernt bad but you could tell the wrighter did not like anne boleyn for the olny nice things about her was befor she died the people said she made a fine speach that you never hear and she goes to schfold kneels down and bends her head and starts to laugh histaricly then bends her head again witch is compleatly inaccurate. and they made her charcter very ugly . other then that not bad"
4,Finnish Black Metal,"This is the debut album from the COB. In the same year, when this album were released, Children Of Bodom went to gig with CRADLE OF FILTH and supported the Norwegian black metal band DIMMU BORGIR at the gig in Helsinki, Finland.This album contains VERY angry metal, so be sure when you buy this album. But notice: You will love it, when you buy it!!!"
1,Appalling and tactless,"That any functioning adult would dare to write such a blatant rip off of Harry Potter is disturbing and confusing. This appalling exercise is such an over the top and obvious ploy to tap into an existing market that one can hardly believe the author hasn't been sued yet. Luckily for Mr. Ensor, he doesn't have enough talent (or indeed, basic writing ability) to actually worry J.K. Rowling, saving himself from such a fate. Don't even consider it - unless you need a White Elephant gift, in which case, go to."
3,No dust cover,"The item in the picture does not represent the items you receive. You see a bracket, you see a dust cover---you receive a bracket---------no dust cover. Amazon or seller really should replace product picture with the product you actually receive and not the product plus another product that you have to buy seperatly. Would give more stars if not for this deception."
1,good thing it was cheap,looks nice too bad it doesnt work. the second hand comes off and then the clock cant work. good thing it was cheap
4,comic,"This book is good comic relief!!! I enjoy Far Side books, have almost every one that this author has written!"
3,Not quite there,"Gravity Kills first album was ground breaking, but Perversion just doesn't quite hit the mark. Musically the band is more seasoned and experimental. Rythmns are strong and the sound is layered with guitars. But the vocals are just over worked by effects and the mellodies don't flow very well. The album just didn't hold my interest through the first few tracks. What's more disappointing to me is that I'm a fan and have been anticipating the release of the new album. But, this album just didn't measure up."
3,Bach as Romantic Composer?,"With its slower tempi and very legato playing and large forces, this does not sound at all like Bach, but rather something from Mozart's pen, or perhaps even later into the romantic period.The sound is pretty good, but it's not at all faithful to Bach or the Baroque. In this case the mass is better in the hands of a period ensemble like Gardiner's -- Shaw's version is just too ponderous and loses much of the light and brisk quality of BAroque era music."
5,Andreas Vollenweider,"I had this CD many years ago, loaned it someone and it was never returned. It was one of my favourites. Now I have purchased it again and it is even better than my original CD with added features. I am over the moon and very pleased with my purchase. Also Amazon delivered very promptly, way under the estimated receiving time."
1,"Had this been his first song, it wouldn't be on the airwaves","This song is a musical sappy mess. Of course we love ""Livin La Vida Loca"", but if Ricky sang the Sesame Street song for his next release, it would sell. Why? Because people are sheep! I've known a couple of artists trying to break into the industry with great lyrics, music and powerfully versatile voices, and their demos are returned unopened. Some of their songs were 10 times better than ""She's All I Need"". So Ricky, keep shakin it and keep it snappy cause this attempt is pathetic."
5,The Beast,A must-read for those who have their own beast or are close to someone who does. Thompson does a superb job describing what life with depression is like. She outdid herself in this investigative report about herself.
3,"A classic, but outdated in terms of information!!","I am a former physiology teaching fellow and research biochemist. In my daily life, I do stress management work with executives and others. While this book is a classic, it is NOT current and mostly of historical interest. For an easy read that is more accurate, try THE END OF STRESS AS WE KNOW IT. If you have a good biology background, then my favorite book in this genre is WHY ZEBRAS DON'T GET ULCERS by Sapolsky.The three rating is not because it's a poorly written book, just that it is so behind the times it could be misleading. I would rate it higher for historical interest, but not for solid information on the stress response. We know much more about it now and Selye was off the mark in some important ways."
2,i don't get it,"i have read many reviews and i can't think any reason why this album is praisen,..it's boring metal,..not black metal,as the music isn't raw,.it isn't very great,every song is a typical covenant-song with same riffs and ideas,..there isn't one single great moment in this album,and every time i have listened to this,i have fallen sleep,..i don't say that this should be more ""blackish"",but i think that they should have done better songs,..they can play well,but everything is boiled by these boring songs,..if you want to know what real avantgarde post-black metal art is; listen to arcturus' la masquerade infernale,...i'll give this record two stars only because hellhammer and sverd are great musicians,..tired record,..aware"
3,Interestingly atmospheric soundtrack,"This soundtrack is surprisingly good. I usually like only the score portion of the CD and completely ignore the various artists, but that wasn't the case this time around. Although the score didn't seem to be recorded right (the sound quality is muffled) it's still very enjoyable as well as the songs that came before them. My favorite ""various artist"" has to be ""Will and Penny's theme""."
2,What do you know about scoring for films?,Another Silverado? You've got to be kidding me. There wasn't enough room between the sound effects for two bars of any melody! What about the subtle woodwind passages(which were obviously inspired from the original series) during Dr. Smith's scenes. Why don't you get a real job?
2,"Great price, too good to be true","I just sent this gun back to grizzly today for a refund. It comes at a good price but you get what you pay for. The gun would shoot nails flush when it would shoot, but would not fire part of the time and would leak air buy the trigger when it miss fired. I sent for a porter cable FR350A, it has a very large amount of very good reviews at amazon and from other web sites. I have an 18ga porter cable gun that works great every time. I have heard good things about Grizzly products, but this $99 gun was just too cheaply made. Live and learn they say."
3,OVERPRICED,The power cord is probably built in China at a cost of $2.00 it does not justify it's retail price. After my purchase I found a similar power cord with the same connectors and better quality for half the retail price.I am an audiophile and at the time of purchase wanted to get the maximum benefit from my CD Player.
4,Weirdly Cool.,"It's a strange movie but I loved it. Angela Tropea is very good and very easy on the eyes, and yes she's naked and shows a lot of skin. She doesn't say alot in first part of the movie and she does a good job of showing her emotions thru her expressions and body language. Hope to see her in more."
2,Haven't we seen this already?,"""That Which Survives"" is a typical Trek story, but it has some fun scenes that prevent it from being a total dud. Mainly just a ho hum show."
2,disappointed,"I don't like the consistency of the product.I had a Bath & Body Works gardenia product beforethat was much richer and creamier than this butI couldn't find it any more.I wouldn't buy this product again, butI'll use it until it's gone."
4,An overrated stuffed animal,"We bought this for my daughters (and the Tyrone one). They love Backyardigans and I thought this would be cute since it sings in the familiar voice they know. It came from Amazon with dead batteries- which cost more than I paid for the toy to replace. It takes 3- large cell batteries.It sings a short song, has a few sayings and that's it. It was a hit in our house for about a week- now it is at the bottom of the toy box."
2,'Elevator Music',I am realy dissapointed with this CD.It starts out very well with 'Lion King' until orchestration is added including a lot that seams synthesized and dimensionly flat. Diction holds no interest.Have you ever had a mouthfull of de-ionized water? It's like water but something is so spewingly absent and bland.This describes this CD. The sad thing is that there are so many pieces on this album that could have been completely captivating!
1,Lose the orchestra!,I much prefer the group's a cappella works - the instrumental accompaniment makes for a sappy sound.
2,Looks good and great if you don't have to open it to refill ink.,"When I opened the pen to see how big was refill, it fell apart and could not put it together."
2,Decent Quality - BUT it's a BOOTLEG,"Bob Lind's own web site reported this is an unauthorized CD bootleg. The misspellings are the first clue. Also, the lack of credits. The only track that seems to be from a digital source is ""Elusive Butterfly""; everything else is clearly copied from vinyl records (you can hear the snap, crackle, pop of the record surface). The high cost of this CD makes it a total rip-off. I gave it 2 stars because Bob Lind still sounds good, otherwise it would have been zero. Don't buy this unless you cannot wait for a legitimate release."
4,Ideal for the Windows Administrator,"This squat 350 page book is filled with practical advice for anyone tasked with the administration of one or more Windows servers. It covers simple remote machine management, Active Directory, IIS, and the truly annoying Windows DNS issues. Screen shots are kept to a minimum and graphics are used effectively. Concepts are explained but not rat-holed and the topics covered are practical. The only thing keeping me from giving this a perfect ranking are the often longish code samples that are not annotated and could be referenced on the site as opposed to included in the text.A must have for starting Windows administrators, definitely worth the look for experienced ones, particularly because of the condensed practical nature of the text with Microsoft Press books so often lack."
3,A Christian perspective,"Being a Christian, I feel that if I want people of other religious beliefs to listen to what I have to say, I should be willing to listen to their beliefs also. I can't say whether this particular title is any better or worse than any other English rendition of the Qur'an, nor will I find out. I confirmed some of the hearsay that I get from ignorant Christians, while being surprised at some of what I read. Although there are similarities between Christianity and Islam, there is also a wide gap. In my opinion, this book does not teach or instruct much at all, but is a book of warnings. The Surah's (Chapters) are very redundant and contradictory. Paraphrased Bible stories are rampant often leaving out significant details. Overall, my mood was one of despair and hopelessness while reading, with only an occasional shot of hope. However, I still stand by my belief that to be good at a debate, blatant ignorance is disgrace to the witnesser."
3,A Recommend Another Translation,"While I found this translation to be good, the translation I read by Rashad Khalifa was more clear and easy to understand. In addition, I found the research regarding the mathematical structure of the Quran in Khalifa's translation to be extremely informative."
1,statistical error + babble = useless,In the excerpt on this website he says that the distribution of stock returns does not touch the horizontal axis in either tail and infers that the variance is thus infinite. This does not follow. For example the normal distribution has a finite variance yet the tails of the normal distribution do not ever 'touch the horizontal axis'.
4,A Traveller's Journal,"This is actually a 1994 orchestral album of Tomita's own soundtrack compositions. Its has some synths but is recorded by an orchestra ans is a great glimpse of his other career as a top orchestral soundtrack composer. He supervised this album himself, so its not some quickie runthrough like some newly recorded soundtrack collections."
2,Disappointing (but still useful),"I might be spoiled, because I expected the same functionality from this product as I've had with the National Geographic Topo! series (USA only.) I want to be able to draw a path, then save it in a file and get an elevation profile. Instead, I can only describe a temporary path on a map, for which the program calculates distance, but no elevations. Why have a topographic map if you're not interested in elevations? The interface is also cluttered and anything but intuitive. Still, the maps are there, and it sure beats buying all the paper and lugging it around with me."
4,Love and Courage,"High Hearts is a captivating book about the Civil War. It takes place in Albermarle, Virginia in 1861. It is about a young woman named Geneva Chatfield who lately marries Nash Hart. Only a few days after there marriage he goes off to fight on the Confederate side. Geneva decides to cut her hair and become a soldier so that she can be with Nash. This book is about courage and true love. It is also about finding your true self. I reccomend this book because it makes you understand that the war caused an immense amount of grief to both sides."
3,Can find the leak!,I have owned several Aero beds in the past without any problems however one of the two beds I recently purchased has a leak and I can't find it. I am returning it after having it for less than two months.
2,Puncture resistant my eye,"Got to use it once - friend said it was comfortable. Had another friend come to stay for a week. Went to inflate it and it never made the high-pitched whine indicating full inflation. Has a leak and despite our best efforts, cannot find it to patch it. I don't know if there's a warranty, but even if there is, who wants to go through the hassle of packaging and shipping a 35 lb bed? Probably cheaper to buy another one (not that I would). I feel like I threw away my money."
2,very poor book,Actually a chapbook with little to reccommend it. Most of the stories are found else where and there is nothing new
3,You get what you pay for...,"After buying an old victorian we were blessed with a pink and magenta kitchen. Donned with the task of redecorating this anathema, I bought this book to help with color choices and design. The small size did not lend itself well to decorating ideas (squinting for ideas is never a good idea - my husband worries I'll mistake the oven for cabinets and we'll end up with black enamel cabinets and a cherry wood stained oven if that's possible), but it was helpful, and I do believe that you get what you pay for. This book is less expensive and therefore, less bulky...so I give it 3 stars."
2,Not So Much,"I love the Taebo Amped Series and the Advanced 1 and 2 Get Ripped Series. Billy Blanks PT 24/7 was a huge dissappointment if you are needing a strenuous workout. This is not it!! I felt nothing in 24 hours...The gloves are big but manageable and not as big of a deal as some of the reviews have made them out to be. For me, this workout is for beginners at best."
1,Disappointed!!,"I purchased and anxiously awaited my package to arrive. Once it did I was absolutely gob smacked. The gloves are huge, I'm a small training glove and my hands swim around in the gloves so much so they can't be worn. I contacted customer service and they advised they could refund but not actually supply a smaller glove. As you can imagine highly disappointed the product went back in the box and it's sitting on the shelf. I want to use the product but it was not sold as advertised and no where on the site does it mention that the gloves are a large size. This product doesn't cater for small women's hands. I believe this product isn't sold rightfully explaining the actual size of the gloves.I wish I could upload a picture to show you exactly how big these gloves are in comparison to my usual training gloves. Very misleading!!"
1,Disappointed Sister,"I ordered this item for my Sister and she liked it a lot ... until she discovered that one of the CDs would not read or play. I attempted to contact the seller (Not Amazon, but a private seller using the Amazon platform) a couple of times with a request to resolve the issue, but I have received No Reply as of this writing.Good product; Questionable Seller."
3,"The Biggest Loser: The weight loss program to transform your body, health, and life--adapted from NBC's hit show","great motivator, however the weekly plan that they give you is hard to do. If you want to follow it step by step and word for word you need to prepare a lot of the food ahead of time. So make sure when you start this program you do the prep work, otherwise is gets too time consuming and you lose the motivation. I did follow it for part of the first week and lost 6 lbs. so it does do what its suppose to do, however just too time consuming of a mother of a 2 year."
1,Not What I was expecting,"After reading this book I was left wondering why I bought it in the first place. Yes, I love the show, but there just isn't anything new here that gives me any reason to believe I can succeed long term. Eat less exercise more...if it was that simple I wouldn't need a book. I need help with a lifestyle adjustment that can really work for me and counting calories never worked for me and it seems like it doesn't work for most people."
5,Awesome,I really enjoyed reading this book and seeing the stories and receipes. I have lost 9 lbs. so far and feel so much better.
4,"The Biggest Loser: The Weight Loss Program to Transform Your Body, Health, and Life--Adapted from NBC's Hit Show!","Although I could have done without all of the show participant promotion, the book was really helpful. It did a great job of laying out an easy to follow eating and exercising plan."
2,bits and bobs,"I bought this book because it was advertised as Bob Harpers book. Needless to say, it's not. It isn't Jillian Michaels book either. The book is fun and there are lots of pictures of Bob, but no real weight loss advice that amounts to a program of any kind. I like the book because I am a fan of the show and it does have some motivational anecdotes, but I wouldn't recommend it as a weight loss plan."
2,dissapointed,"I ordered this book months ago as a pre-sale. I think it is good if you are a fan of the show looking to learn more about the contestants and their personal trials and tribulations. If you are someone looking for weight loss advice this book is as void of that as the actual show. It is very story heavy and lacks any real information. What little information it does provide in the way of diet and exercise is overly simplified and generic. At the end of the day, it was interesting to read the contestants anecdotes, but dissapointing as a source of information."
2,Don't be fooled,This book is a piece of fluff. There is absolutely no REAL information in it. I feel totally jipped. Don't be foole. I agree that if you are serious about losing weight Jillian Michaels book Wining By Losing is the much better choice.
3,"An Easy, Inspiring Read","As one of the season's most popular TV shows, ""The Biggest Loser"" had us all dreaming about losing weight and getting in shape. With just two brief chapters devoted to diet and exercise plans, this book is primarily a motivational tool for would-be dieters, however. Filled with before-and-after photos, tips, recipes and lots of encouragement, it could be the jumpstart to a new you, though. An easy, inspiring read."
3,Biggest Loser book,"Couldn't stand the recipe's in the back. The book doesn't say anything that I found was new or interesting. I wouldn't purchase again, nor have I ever purchased any of the other books they put out."
3,If you have to have something...,"It's ok. It's nothing special. It is as skinny as it looks. I believe it will be sturdy and so in that way I guess it's better than the plastic, car dealership version, but if I had tried it on for size and had the opportunity to return it to a store, I would. I'm glad it was only $5."
2,Too slim,The license plate frame is as promised very slim. Unfortunately it is too slim for my license plate and ends up showing the top portion of the plate - not a very attractive feature. I'm moving onto one with a little more width on the edges.
5,The Best Pedagogical Approach to Poetry,"I've been writing poetry for almost ten years. But I really shouldn't count the years before I was taught with this book, mainly because what I wrote then was preconceived, melodramatic, first-draft garbage. The text systemically breaks down poetry into the smallest unit of sound, while also holistically analyzing it with examples and questions that really allow the student to reflect on the material. The end result is liberation, and not what someone might expect from a book that ""teaches"" you. No longer will you set out to write the greatest poem ever. You will simply write, and if you learned anything from the book, your writing will automatically be astounding, especially if you compare it to your previous works.I've read many introductory books on poetry. None of them measure up to this one."
4,Hard Times,"An Afghan film called Osama belongs to a special genre. Not just because it is Afghan, which is rare enough, but because it deals with political violence and was made, very shortly afterward, in the place where it happened.The head of this genre is probably Rossellini's ""Open City"", which was about the German oppression of Rome and was made there in early 1945, only a few months after the Germans had left. Italians donned German uniforms to portray their recent oppressors.Osama was made in Kabul in 2003 and deals with the recent tyranny of the Taliban in that city. Once again victims portray their oppressors and once again we are dealt with a gritty and depressing reality.I liked both films, OPEN CITY and OSAMA for the openess and truth they reveal. You will see things in both of these foreign language films that you have never seen before on the big screen.This is not a film for everybody to see. If you can handle the truth, go see it."
4,Excellent graphical guide for beginners,I teach networking classes at Computer Applications Company and I have found this book to be an excellent resource for beginners to learn networking terminology and concepts. Most of the students who used this book learned the concepts quickly.
4,Depends on what you are looking for,"If you are looking to be a Network Admin. or to be able to design and implement a new network, then this book would be no more than an appetizer.This book is really good for those of us who just have some questions and want to be able to understand how things work a little better. After reading this book, I realize I have more to learn."
1,No quality and they are unusable in My state,"I just received My order for two Cruiser #21110 Stainless steellicense plate frames.First of all they are way over sized and cover the State nameand state motto from sight,therefore they are unusable in Mystate.Second the quality is unbelievable,I would not even put them onany thing that needed a license plate bracket,not even a littlered wagon.Third,the most disappointing thing is I trusted Amazon to send Mequality goods in My orders,not some trash."
1,Serious emotional issues with no resolution...just dissolution,"There are many well written reviews that I agree with on Amazon.com regarding: 1) the unexplicable intense rage and anger from the very outset, 2)completely unacceptable behavior of the boy towards his kind and caring mother, 3)lack of character development for the monsters (which obviously were a reflexion of the boys emotional issues), 4)lack of resolution between the monsters or the boy and his mother. It has it's artistic moments, and I can tolerate a lack of true plot when my senses are emotions are deeply involved, however at 40 minutes, I wanted the movie to just end. I would not show it to children and I would not recommend it to friends. For those who can relate because of their own deep emotional problems, a movie like this only adds fuel to your rage and does not help you come to closure.I want my 2 hours back and I'm not going to write any more on this subject so that it doesn't waste anymore of my time."
2,Not really a movie for kids...,I watched this with my 6 year old and neither of us cared for it. It was missing something that made it pop and I did not like the way the family was acted out.
1,Total Garbage,This is not a kids movie. I have a 5 & 6 year old and turned it off as soon as the horrible child behavior came on.Dont even think about it for kids under 13. And even then it is awful. I would have given it zero stars if I could. Its getting returned tomorrow.
1,Terrible adaptation from book to silver screen,A mindless mess that should have been geared toward younger children but wasn't geared toward any specific age group. We took our daughter to see what we thought would be a good adaptation of the book but were horrified by this absolute pile of crap. Not for children of any age!
1,Very Disappointing,"Don't waste your time or money on this one. The only thing this movie clearly portrayed was that that is how rough and out of control boys behave. Way too much effort was placed on negative aspects, and very little if anything towards anything positive. You have to dig pretty deep for any meaning symbolic or otherwise. A real let down for ALL ages. The ONLY think I enjoyed was the facial expressions of the `wild things'."
1,where the wild things are,not for any child. Horrible Horrible! I love the book when I was little and this movie was a HUGE disapointment!
2,"A movie so obsessed with being cool, it neglected to tell a story","I was extremely disappointed with this adaptation of a book I loved as a child--and even now as a parent reading to my children. Being familiar with Spike Jonze, I was not expecting a Disney movie; I was just hoping for an inventive movie loosely inspired by a classic story of imagination. That was obviously the plan, but then things went terribly wrong. There is just no magic here, at all. It is a movie so obsessed with being cool, that it neglected to tell a story. At times it even wandered into the forced sentimentality of a greeting card commercial. I guess I am just not cool enough to get the irony."
2,Behind the scenes videos were much more entertaining,"After watching behind the scenes videos, and seeing all those kids on the set, I did understand the intention of people who made this movie. The idea was great, the delivery....is another story. First of all, all the yelling and screaming and crying of the main character at the beginning of this movie was by very least disturbing, and autistic like. Then when he got to the land with all these furry creatures, it was evidently a personally psychological battle. So to call it a movie for children one cannot. Perhaps very little children would find it amusing, but certainly without truly scary and disturbing beginning. Again the idea was great, but what came out, should be a part of the curriculum in a school of psychiatry, but not as an entertainment piece."
1,sorry I bought it,The book is better. The little boy is good but the story and the wild things were sooooo diappointing. Not even a nice try!
3,Book vs movie - imagination at its best,"Considering the book says little, they really took imagination to its fullest. Not sure there are a lot of kids that think this deeply at the age of the boy in the movie. Covered general thoughts but I felt it carried them way beyond a child's imagination. Characters have lots of issues but it might have been better if younger children would have written the script. Somewhat difficult to put the pieces together. Maybe if you have lived in a disfunctional family it would be better understood. I could not really associate with a lot of this thinking back to my childhood."
2,skipped a bit,"The item arrived on time and looked to be in good condition. However, halfway through it froze. I waited a little while and it eventually did unfreeze, so the movie is playable, but it's still annoying."
1,"WILD, BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY","This movie features a manic child who is destructive and violent (bites his mother only 10 minutes into the film). He finds a fantasy world where everyone mopes around, harrasses, and nags each other, so his behavior is lauded. Not only does the hero need some serious behavioral modification, but the story itself was incredibly bleak and depressing. The Wild Things themselves are a bunch of curmudgeons who have nothing better to do than kvetch all day, and this movie had nothing positive to offer my kids or my family."
1,A review from a grandma,"My son's favorite book when he was a child was ""Where the Wild Things Are"" and I couldn't wait to get the movie for his children, aged 2 and 5. We watched it, together, but had to stop it half way through. It scared the kids and was very disappointing! It is not a story for young children and should be viewed by older children age 9 and up. The adult reviews say it is good because it was viewed by an ADULT! I think you have to be an adult to understand what's going on in the movie!"
4,"Extremely stiff, hard to push release","I know tension boots are supposed to be stiff but these are really pushing that to the point of issue. They make it rather difficult to press the release levers on the cables, so any cable I make that I plan on using to plug in and out fairly often just ends up with the boots slid away."
4,as expected,They do a decent enough job. The price was reasonable. a bit loose on the relief but not as bad as some that are much more expensive. They get the job done for certain!
2,DIDN'T KEEP MY INTEREST,"When I read the description of the book about Russ - a cop with too much on his plate and Laurel - a hearing impaired potential victim in his current case, I thought it sounded like such a good read, but unfortunately it wasn't.The book had potential, but the writing didn't follow through with character development. Sure there was steamy sex, but when you can't care about the characters, you lose interest. It becomes just reading the words with no emotional pull. If I don't become involved in the story there isn't much point to it. This is a book I could put down, in fact it took 3 days to get through it. I hope the writer takes more care with the characters in her next book."
4,Great cookbook but we need a light version,"I love this cookbook because it has very traditional recipes. However, the recipes are high in fat. I would love to add to my library a 'light' version of this book."
4,"Easy to follow directions, delicious receipes.",An excellent source of Puerto Rican cuisine. I have been using this book since 1963. It was a gift from my mother in law who was a fantastic cook and whom I kept pestering for receipes as a new bride. It has been my only source for receipes from back home and I continue to pass on these receipes to my children. I only wish there was a copy in english as some of the terminology and names of foods I am not failiar with.
5,Fun and a great silly read,"You can't take this book too seriously it is FUN and silly and a good way to START to talk to your kids about manners. It's in no way intended to be a serious life lesson. Have fun with it, it's a riot :) Great illustrations, my kids giggled over and over from this one! All I have to do now is say the words 'blowfart inhaler suit' and it's an instant pick me up for my kids :)"
4,GREAT BOOK,"A friend of mine gave this book about 9 years ago, I enjoyed it then and I still go back and read it now, it has been one the best wine books I have, easy to read and very helpful, it sure gave the information I needed to star my wine cellar."
4,"Michael Colina ""Shadow of Urbano""","One of the best discs I have ever owned, and you don't hear very much about Michael Colina. But both of his discs (Rituals is the other) just leave you wanting more. But I know he writes and produces for lots of people and if I see his name in the credits, then eventually I'll purchase it. He's a very talented artist."
1,Inferior in every way,"The Alberts text (Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fourth Edition) is superior to this text in every way. It is clearer, more precise, and contains more information. This one manages to make simple concepts become quite difficult."
3,i like some,"the only songs i like are emperor, dimmu borgir, cradle of filth, agathodaimon, covenant, dissection, dismal euphony, naglfar, and gehenna is ok. i think satyricon, immortal, mayhem, and the abyss is just mindless noise. and i think bal sagoth and enslaved are laughable thay are so silly. especially bal sagoth, what with the fake trumpets and all."
5,Another wonderful history book by Massie,"Another great history book by this respected author. Well written, just enough detail to give context to the time and place and captivating from start to finish!"
4,Outstanding narrative history,"<u>Castles of Steel</u> is an outstanding narrative history of naval planning, engagements, successes, failures, and government in The Great War. Highly recommended because of the lucid writing style, narrative pace, and excellent bibliography."
3,Decent to much,"This is a very interesting book about the Sea and WWI. Unfortunatyl it only covers germnay and england in regards to the naval conflict. What about Austria, Turkey, Italy and the others. The neveies of engalnd and germnay fought an all out war in the north atlantic. THis book focuses on the battle of Jutland in great detail. AN interesting account.What about the Emden and Dresden?"
2,Disappointingly thin plot/ Susan Johnson usually does better,"Susan Johnson does very lusty novels and that is part of her appeal. However, this book along with her previous book was thin on plot. The female heroine wasn't very appealing with all of her doubts about the hero. The best part was the footnotes."
3,Good fun for the car,"good fun for the car when you have kids in it. some of the tunes are out of tune though. maybe on purpose, but it can get irritating."
4,Devil's Bed,"This is a really good mystery in which some people aren't what they seem, or even should be. I liked it so much that I am sharing it with friends.I have been a Krueger fan since I read Iron Lake. While this is a story of other characters, it is equally well written and full of twists."
4,Well written history,"This is a fasinating book. It covers all the back story of the charge of the light brigade and why is was such a slaughter. I enjoyed finding out about the culture of the English aristocracy in the mid 1800s and a detailed account of the Irish potato famine. The personalities of the Earl of Lucan and the Earl of Cardigan are explored in depth. I reccomend this book to anyone interested in British history or the history of war. By the way, my husband read this book for a history of war class when he was a student at Caltech 43 years ago."
1,Poor Customer Support,"I purchased this spray gun because of the good reviews however buyer beware. I ordered it with the 2.0 spray tip,received the gun and the 2.0 spray tip was not available at the time, had to contact Grizzly direct to place the order. Item was back ordered 4 weeks, when I called after 3 weeks they said it would not be available for another 4 more months. ARE YOU KIDDING ME !!!! They wouldn't do anything for me except say they were sorry. Not very impressed with my first experience using Grizzly & have no plans on any future purchases with these folks. So like I said buyer beware, might not get what you ask for, call first, make sure they have it in stock, then place your order. OH & Good Luck!!!"
2,Booooo! Bad Ending!,"E. Nesbit is usually such a satisfying read--but not this one. There are too many lose ends, and did I mention a bad ending? Give this one a skip and stick to her more famous works."
5,Tasty and Healthy!,"I am seriously loving this book, I was skeptical at first because I considered it ""diet food"". Honestly though I can't tell a difference. I have made a few of the recipes and it is definitely helping me quick start my healthier eating journey."
5,A cookbook I actually *use*!,"I checkedThe Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Showout of the library since I have learned that I am far more likely to *read* cookbooks than use them. So many have recipes that take too much time or require special ingredients. When I had renewed this book the maximum allowed times, I knew I should buy it! The recipes in here are mostly quick and easy. The photos are great (I wish there were more!). Plus, I love that these recipes, on the whole, make enough food for 1-2 people. Since I'm only cooking for two, it's nice not to have mountains of leftovers. If you're looking for a great, health-conscious cookbook for real people, this is a great choice!"
2,Personally...,I keep my reviews pretty short and I'm a teenager so keep all this in mind when reading this review. This book wasn't for me. I was really excited to finally own a healthy cookbook but when I went through all the recipes I was actually disappointed. And no I am NOT a picky eater. The only thing I found appetizing was some spinach and cheese dish by Mo. I guess it is my fault for thinking I had the time or money to cook. Hopefully I can return this book and get The Biggest Loser's Quick and Easy one...or search the internet for an endless supply of recipes.
4,Cooking for one,"I ordered this book after checking it out from the local library. I liked how many of the recipes are single servings. As someone who is only cooking for one, it is nice to be able to not have to eat left-overs for every meal. I am not sure how ""healthy"" the recipes are, but they are easy to make, many only have a few ingredients and some spices."
1,Not good for a picky eater,"I bought this cookbook and was excited to get into it. I then found that I didn't like it at all. I am a picky eater, and most of the recipes include things that I will not eat, however if I leave them out of the recipe, then the recipe would be lacking in flavor. The other thing I don't like about it is that they remove sugar and use sugar substitutes. I don't like that either. So I recently bought the sparkpeople cookbook, and I am much happier with it."
5,why buy new!,these were books I had wanted to purchase when they first come out and just never got arround to it. Im glad that I didn't compaired to what I would have spent!
4,Biggest Loser Cookbook is a Hit,"Have made several recipes. They are easy to follow, taste good and don't take a lot of prep time. Great for a working individual!"
3,"Not effective for ""Dry Mouth""","My ENT Doc recommended this to me for my ""Dry Mouth"" condition which is the result of Radiation treatment of my throat. I bought this and the other variety, ""Organic Throat Coat"". The other tea worked wonders, this had no affect on the Dry Mouth or the sore throat that I also have as a side effect."
2,Disappointing Coverage of Important Topic,"This set of tapes was very disappointing. The makers of these films need to sit down with a typical middle schooler or have some experienced teachers provide them some guidance. The producers clearly do not have a grasp of what engages a teenager (adults would be bored too). In the tapes, talking heads dominate . Many sections look like a slide show with text superimposed. The background music is positively awful and the narration is monotonous. Suggestions: Use clips from CSPAN with Congressmen going after it. Use more Senators, justices and Administrative workers and let them explain what they do. Find some entertaining personality to guide the viewer through the show and interview people instead of using a narrator's voice-over. Use anecdotes. Loosen up. Have some fun. Inject some humor. I would agree that the tapes are fairly informative but if you are a teacher be forewarned: your students will lose interest very quickly."
4,An interesting view of Alaska and the 1 year adventure of KR,I found this book to be very informative about the land and extream weather of Alaska but it ran a little dry quickly. This is a journal of around 9 months of Rockwell kents life while in Alaska. I have read other books that were written from journals and Kents does fair better then most. I can understand that a journal in Alsaka can run out of new and interesting things to write about and this book seemed to try to fill in the gaps with Kents thoughts and many philosophies. All in all I do recomend this book to anyone who really want a real veiw of what Alaska is actually like.
3,Just Okay,"Father Frank Redmond is a N.Y. City Priest who shared a moment of glory in the 1950's with four other boys at a Jesuit High School. As adults, the other boys turned out to be a policeman, an assistant D.A. and a newspaper reporter. When Father Redmond falls to his death off a N.Y. rooftop, his surviving friends try to determine if it was suicide or murder, given Father Redmond's controversial priesthood. We see the story pieced together by way of chapter-long flashbacks. While intriguing, the ending of the book left me feeling like I had been cheated."
1,I am reviewing the Audio CD,"The story itself is not something I normally go for. I am not a reader of depressing crime fiction, and this was very depressing. I don't like it when the Catholic church is used as a punching bag, as it is in this book. So, in all, I did NOT like the story.But aside from the story, I found the narration of the story very dry. The reader's voice was not very contrasting, engaging, or interesting. What parts I enjoyed (like the scene where Earl ""confronts"" the mafia boss in the restaurant), I enjoyed despite the narration.The story was depressing and the reading was disengaging.In short, I skipped about 1/2 of the book but I still know most of what happened and I don't care about what I missed. I wish I had not picked this up at the library. It's a few hours I will never get back.(*)>"
4,"Good EP, worth your 6 bucks","All of the tracks are well done, acoustically and raw. It's a nice side of a tireless performer in a stripped down element. Well done."
2,Too many wires for me.,It seemed to difficult for me. There weren't enough instructions so I have just put it aside until maybe I can find someone who can help me.
5,Outstanding spy novel,"Author Deighton writes with exceptional sense of time and place. While the story line holds your interest tightly, the descriptions of people and local add greatly to the overall effect of these outstanding novels."
2,Prior Tropical Fish Tank Owner/Critic.,"I found Video Aquarium barely adequate--filmed in the early '80s--now 2005 where the poor (sloppy?) focus and reflected lighting (a foggy smear on the tank's front glass at 2/5ths top left fading out about 2/3rds across the top to the right in an unchanging vaguely triangular pattern) with better cameras and ""professional"" versus ""ad hoc"" attention to the lighting could resolve those problems. [I'm using a JCV 27"" monitor so I KNOW it's not the TV's problem.] That it has the sound of a working aquarium rather than music (which most of the others mistakenly feature) is a plus, BUT...if you're going to make a video of this nature, make a GOOD one, price it accordingly--or none at all!"
1,hoorats,worst movie ever and money threw it away. friend gave his to the goodwill. my other friend sold his on ebay for 99 cent
2,hood rats,I knew this movie would be a low budget film and I was not expecting much and that is exactly what I got at the most it was filmed in two locations a street corner for 15 minutes and about 45 thru 1 hour in a living room I give this movie 2 stars because 1 star is just to mean
3,"The animals have passports, but the filmmakers don't seem to...","My 5 year old animal-loving son seemed to like this DVD well enough when we watched it for the first time, but I was annoyed to see that all the animals were filmed in zoos or wild animal parks with fences and cement barriers clearly visible in the shots. In an apparent attempt to minimize this, most of the shots were framed very tightly - head and shoulders, mostly.The narrative contains a solid stream of facts and isn't cloying as it can be in some videos marketed to younger kids, but telling us that the lion roams the grasslands in search of prey, while we see a lion lying down in a dusty enclosure with a fence behind him was less than impressive."
3,Not as good as mine,"This was the second McCammon book that I have read. ""Mine"" was the first, and ""Mine"" continues to be his best. McCammon did not make this book as interesting and terrifying as ""Mine"", however the characters were very multifaceted and interwoven into the story as ""Mine"" was. All in all, a good read."
5,McCammon himself recommends reading this 1st,"I was present at a book conference where Mr. McCammon spoke at a panel. One question was put to him about which of his books he'd recommend a reader new to his works try first. He said Mystery Walk.I also find Mystery Walk a great introduction to McCammon's talents perhaps at their finest, most honed perfection. Characters are compelling, emotionally involving, and real; plot tension keeps you turning the pages; the flow of the narritive is cinematically rich in detail as well as action and movement; the ending very satisfying."
5,Another good read from McCammon,"This is the sixth McCammon book I read, and although people say theres an evident King influence to his writing in this particular work, I might even say, yes, there is, but it still bears his cinematic writing style and his bizarre characters. It makes for tense reading and is well worth recommending for all fans."
1,You don't need this,"There is nothing in this kit you can not do yourself. The booklet is only a guide to using the things in it.The poster and stars to chart your progress is something you can do yourself or with your kids. Get a piece of cardboard and some starts. Easy.The stickers again, you can get some for a dollar or use some old ones all mums have laying around.The motivational cards are better made by you, something personal to you.And that's it.I didn't buy this box. I looked at it in the shop. I didn't buy it because I didn't need it and neither do you. Just write."
2,A gimmick,"No sooner had I taken off the wrapping and inspected the contents, I realized I'd been had. This is nothing more than a gimmick; the book by the same title might have been slightly better. But at this point I wouldn't bet any money on it being so. I think the author must be thinking that his title is so catchy it's worth the price of a book, or in this case, a kit. Don't waste your money folks, unless you want to buy a very wry gift for someone else."
5,The Best,"F&SF has always been the best science fiction magazine out there. Others have been more popular, but F&SF is always the most consistently readable. The stories range from science fiction to magical realism."
4,The Truth Shall Set You Free,You judge a tree by its fruit. This documentary succeeds in letting viewers behold this dark little secret that the Catholic Church hopes you will never find out about: The rotting fruit of their sin-harvest that comes from unspeakably heinous crimes against children that are tolerated by them as being business-as-usual!Love is the desire to do good to others but that is the antithesis of all that the Catholic Church represents as it was portrayed in this documentary and as revealed by fearless journalists all over the world who have courageously accepted the bold challenge to find the truth no matter where it takes them and then tell it like it is.
5,Outstanding. Very well done documentary.,"It brings to light the sex abuse scandal in the catholic church leading all the way up to the current pope. I have lost what respect I had for the catholic religion as a whole, not the individuals, but the blind authority of the church. It is done in a way that does not further exploit the victims but honors them."
2,It is 2002 and it is time for something new.....,".........and this is not it!The 2 cuts that stand out are Popcorn by Hot Butter and E.V.R. by Jean Jacques Perrey. The rest is a pile headache inducing kitsch. The appreciation of this quaint style of music lies purely in the mind and not in it's sound. No matter what is claimed, this stuff did not influence Krafwerk and should be sent back to the rubbish bin as it is begining to smell. Wendy Carlos was a pioneer on many fronts, but Bach's music is what makes her recordings last. The tracks included here are not even composition they are just pastiche."
2,Only 3 Franklin stories on this DVD,"Unlike many of the other Franklin DVDs, this DVD only has three Franklin stories, i.e. Franklin's Valentines, Franklin Takes a Trip, and Franklin and the Tooth Fairy. The fourth story included on this DVD is not a Franklin story, but an episode of Rolie Polie Olie, which my 4-year-old didn't care for. This is not a value for money compilation compared to many of the other Franklin DVDs."
1,iT SUCKED,"It was a very boring, and meaning less book which shouldnt of even been published. Im saying I hate it"
4,when somethings ending something new is beginning,"I first read That was then, this is now in the sixth grade. It was after i read The Outsiders. And after i fell in love with the outsiders I'd figure i would give this book a try and I'm glad i did. I grew quite fond of this book. It wasn't as sad as the outsiders or as good but it was still satisfying. Then i read S.E Hinton's other novels and i became to know Hintons novels pretty well. I'm also pretty happy that i read her books."
4,What A Story!!!,"After reading the Outsiders by S. E. Hinton and absolutely loved it, I began to look into other books written by her. I happened to fall onto this book. It is really an amazing story it was hard for me to put it down, because every time I did all I wanted to do was to find out what was going to happen next. The only thing about this story is the ending it's really depressing, at lest in my opinion. I mean it hit me really hard; I was depressed for a couple days after completing it. Nonetheless it is a story worth reading."
5,The wrong Book,"Ordered the wrong book, read it anyway loved it! I did not become up set, nor a refund I just read the book"
5,THE BOOK WAS GREAT!,I READ THE BOOK; I THINK IT WAS GOOD. I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE PART WHERE BRION RELIZES THAT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. I GIVE THIS BOOK A PERFECT 10.
3,Good idea but sent out the wrong mesage.,"I thought that the book had a good idea but sent out the wrong mesage, that smoking and drinking as a minor is an okay thing, that you can get extra cash by selling drugs, that no one will ever bust you but you'r buddys, and that police are bad people."
1,The anti-drug theme was handled in a very heavy-handed way,"Although the basic story idea is very good, the theme was handled in a very heavy-handed manner. The first half was full of rich characterizations and descriptions but in the second half, it seemed as if the author grew tired and just wanted to finish the book. A very important story link (namely Bryon,Cathy,and Mark's relationship)is summed up in two paragraphs.The main character, Bryon, ends the book by doing two things which are very out of character. He decides he doesn't like Cathy,after a big rigamarole about how much he loves her. He turns in Mark, which the character presented to the reader at the beginning would never have done. Of course, in every good book the main character changes, as in life, but the entire personality of a person would not change unless he suffered a major brain injury. In short, after reading The Outsiders, I was quite disappointed in this heavy-handed, poorly written book."
3,"That was then, this is now - great for the kids","My daughter had to read this book in school, so I read it too, it is a good book for young inspiring readers."
2,Amazingly boring,"Unfortunately, this was the first Cormac McCarthy book I read...meaning, it will probably be the last. Meandering to non-existent plot. Cormac should hire David Mitchell to teach him how to write. Here's a quick summary of the entire book (without the obscure vocabulary): ""We rode into a small, dusty town. We rode into another small, dusty town. We rode into yet another small, dusty town. At each town we partied really hard. This one guy peed on some clay stuff to create a bomb like thing. The end."""
2,gore without redeeming qualities,"The border trilogy books were excellent and very enjoyable.Blood Meridian however was a problem for me. This may be a true depiction of the times, but I can not understand why anyone would want to read this gore. Not much plot. I like a little gore when the plot substantiates it, but not this. This was not a balanced presentation.Mr. McCarthy, if your purpose was to convince me that the 1840's were bloody, you didn't need 353 pages to do it.I got half way through before I put it down...."
2,one decent page out of every ten,"What a miserable book! A friend recommended I read it and I've come to the conclusion we have very similar tastes in literature. When I read a book I don't want to have to sit there and try to decipher the language - I want to enjoy myself. This book did everything but that - all it really did was annoy the hell out of me. I will admit McCarthy does do a good job of making you feel like you're out in the cruel Mexican desert, but the flat characters and lame ending made me think it was a waste of my money."
1,mindless brutality,"I have read several of McCarthy's books, and actually thought that the Road was one of the very best books I have read. This particular book is page after page of purely blathering, mindless violence; there is no reason for the killings; there is absolutely no character development to give you any insight into the reasons behind the actions. It is pure bunk to me to give the author any credit for ""literary prose"" - this is pure and utter trash.His premise re the basic evil nature of man (I guess seen in most of his books) may be an acceptable premise, but how about some insights into the root causes, rather than an unending tabloid description of killing.Unfortunately, this will be my last McCarthy book."
3,"Classic McCarthy, but a disappointing ending","McCarthy's fact-based tale of Old West violence is a bleak yet compelling read. As in his Border Trilogy, the reader is occasionally harangued by a character's long-winded philosophizing, but here it makes more sense and is more organic to the story. The conclusion, however, is out of left field and gratuitously ambiguous. All in all, I think it's worth the read, although the ending is disappointing."
1,A gifted writer wastes his energy and my time!!!!,"If you like a book with no redeeming value whatsoever..read this one. I kept reading it first hoping for redemption and then later a desire to have all of the characters destroyed. What a shame after he wrote All the Pretty Horses! He is a gifted author with a grear grasp of the English language, however this book reveals a dark, brooding tormented soul. I'm not opposed to violance....The Wild Bunch is one of my favorite films...however in that story you could relate to the anti heroes. It is not a Moby Dick or The Odyessy..it is a disgrace to compare to those classics!!"
1,It's bloody all right!,"It's many things. It may be art. But it's not a traditionally enjoyable book. To me it's like when someone tells you that some form of art they enjoyed is ""challenging."" The characters are not really sympathetic, you can't really relate to them or anything going on, and the story develops very slowly. By the middle of the book the ""judge"" is still being unveiled as a key and somewhat intriguing figure, but I gave up and moved on. My advice: borrow, don't buy."
2,Too much of a bad thing...,"If you would like a good story about the West with interesting language and violence, rent DEADWOOD. Along with the interesting language and violence, you'll get interesting characters, a plot, and humor. You'll also be entertained and learn a few things. I would imagine that the average reader would be pretty bored with this book. Read all the reviews before purchasing this book; especially the ones that contain quotes. I am sorry that I didn't read the reviews. I wouldn't have wasted so much time thinking ""one more chapter, maybe something interesting will happen""."
2,Could not find my way into this book,"I was intrigued by the glowing and interesting amazon reviews of this book as well as the release of Mr. McCarthy's new book. I was very let down. The violence does not stop at all and halfway through you become immune to it. The rest of the bloodshed is rendered moot by the repetition. The characters that are supposed to be followed either in fascination or dread are barely sketched in at all. You can easily forget that ""the kid"" is even in the tale at all. The Judge and Glanton would make interesting studies but no third dimension ever emerges. The scenes are set with elegant words but the dialogue and action fail to live up to that gold standard."
2,"a nearly plot-less, wordy, violent journey","I disliked, borderline hated this novel. In fact, I repeatedly had to force myself to finish it because I thought maybe there would be some epic ending since so many people have said how superb a novel it is. The language was just strange. I would read an entire chapter and didn't really understand what happened. McCarthy is just often too wordy for me as well. I think he just tries too hard. The story had potential but the way he told it, well, nothing happened. Graphic violence and lot of people killed - that about sums it up. The antagonist and protagonist were hard to identify with. I really wish I would have stuck with my gut and just put this one down. Not my cup of tea. I won't be reading anymore McCarthy. 3.5/10"
2,What is this all about?,"Perhaps this is just an American thing, this obsession with the unremitting violence of life. Perhaps that's why the NRA has such traction in a society so steeped in and convinced of the righteous nature of its own paranoid fantasies. Based on a ""true"" story apparently. Well, maybe it was - but that doesn't mean you have to write about it. And so opaquely! I get the nature of the prose and the sentence construction and the parallels with biblical literature etc etc. What is difficult to stomach is to continue to read when I do not give two hoots what happens to anyone in this blasted miserable brick of a book.E M Forster said his motivation in writing was to make you see. In Blood Meridian I fail to see anything. Pity really, because I thought No Country for Old Men was rather brilliant. I simply do not see the world like Cormac McCarthy. I sincerely hope he doesn't see the world like this either."
2,Meh,"I know a lot of people rave about this book, and write epic reviews of praise, touting McCarthy's literary genius. I on the other hand did not particularly enjoy it, to keep it short, it never fully captured my attention and prattles on in it's dark and dreary fashion."
3,lot of violence,"I would say that I've enjoyed other Cormac McCarthy books more, particularly All the Pretty Horses and No Country for Old Men, so if you haven't read those, Id start there first. This one was incredibly violent, more so than any of his other books, and honestly I felt it got a little repetitive. More blood, more depravity. I did enjoy the end when it finally got around to a thoughtful conclusion, but I though it took a little too long."
4,Difficult read but worth it,"I've just started the process of reading through McCarthy's collection, and it has been a wonderful journey so far. Started with The Road, went on to No Country For Old Men, and then to Blood Meridian. It is a totally different experience, in a good way. It was much less concise, more literary/poetic. It was also VERY violent. To the point where I almost had to put the book aside a couple of times, just because it was overwhelming.McCarthy's descriptive capacity is something to behold. His grasp of the flora and fauna in the Southern US and Mexico almost makes this book encyclopedic. He does truly rival the greats like Faulkner.Reading All the Pretty Horses now, and will review that after."
4,A great title from the early days of late-night cable.,"The original Vestron Tape is right at 89 minutes.The other reviews here and elsewhere (like IMDB) have it pretty much covered. But please be aware that there is another listing for this VHS film on Amazon, with much lower prices."
1,Total malarky,"I was treated by Levinson briefly in the 80's when in my early 20's. His office on Long Island is a factory and he is happy to charge outlandish fees and put patients through a series of ""tests"" and then toss off a scrip for dramamine. This is about as close to snake oil as you can get in this modern age.What amazes me is that he is still around, that his book is still in print, and that people believe his ""theory"" in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary."
3,Great story,"I discovered this book several years ago, and at first it gave me the creeps. At that point I didn't know as much as I do now about Satanism or the occult. Nowadays this book makes me laugh because it is so absurd. I actually enjoy reading disinformative anti-Satanic literature such as this, so I give it 3 stars for its entertainment value. It ranks right up there with the Sean Sellers story in that the author has done no research at all on what Satanism truly is, instead just relying on his own concept of what it might be like if all those 70's and 80's horror films were true.I weep for all those people, Christian or not, that believe this book has any truth within its pages because it doesn't. The author perpetuates the urban legends surrounding Satanic Ritual Abuse, and out of fear and ignorance people still believe them.But at least Amazon.com put it in the right section - 'Fiction' :)"
4,Interesting book.,"Yes, I think this is a pretty interesting book (I do have it on my first Listmania book list, and it seems that i'm the only one who has it on theirs, heh). I don't think that this book is lying, this stuff can happen and does exist out there. Of course it may offend Catholics, since it seems to have an anti-Catholic slant to it. I really don't think the Catholic religion is bad at all (*shrugs* hey, I was raised Catholic, so maybe i'm biased or something? ehh). It might also offend Wiccans, it's got an anti-Wiccan slant to it too, and I also don't think that Wicca is bad at all. It is a positive, Earth-loving religion. I say only worry about the dark arts, black magick, that sort of thing. If you don't want trouble, then hey, stay far away from it, as far as you can. Stay in the light. God bless. *smiles*"
5,Know what your up against!,"Great book! This book helps in understanding the many agenda's of the Opposer. Since the the fall of man (fruit of the tree of Knowledge) mankind has continually struggled with seeking and understanding the source of higher power. There is only one true GOD and he is real. What an amazing testimony. Satan always overplays his hand and when he does God always has his way with the situation.. There is real spiritual warfare out there, the worlds preception of reality is warped by the Prince and Power of the air. This book is what your not supposed to know, But Satan's Pawn became God's gain."
3,Fun For Little Ballerinas,"Warm-hearted, colorful illustrations carry us along with Tanya and her new friend, the wardrobe lady at the performance of the ballet Coppelia. When Tanya gets lost backstage she is lucky enough to experience a ""show and tell"" about some of the costumes from other famous ballets. She dances with the wardrobe lady and the French ballet terms are sprinkled liberally throughout the story. This book would be well appreciated by a certain niche of readers but would probably not be of interest to non-dancers."
5,Gorgeous Nature Photography,"This year's calendar is the best ever. The photographs range from impressionistic, to stunning to gorgeous. Beautifully produced with exceptional reproduction quality, paper and printing. This would make a great gift for anyone who loves nature.The quotes on each page are inspiring - religious at times but non-denominational in their scope.Inner Reflections has won many awards over the years, but this year's Engagement Calendar is the best.Peter Burian PBurian@aol.com"
4,Good general purpose blade,"I'm using this on a little Dewalt MBF Radial Arm Saw. The ATB and 10 degree positive hook along with the thin kerf help this somewhat underpowered saw perform well. When using on a radial saw, make sure your saw is in perfect alignment or the positive hook angle may contribute to self feed into the work. A nice blade for the price."
1,SANTA VS SATAN=VERY STRANGE MOVIE,"I'm not sure where to begin with this weird movie.I was just curious to see how weird it really was,and dang I found out that it's pretty freaking weird.The story is about how Satan sends his demon to earth,to try and turn all the children against Santa Claus.The film has very bad acting,with unknown actors and actresses.You can tell they dubbed the dialouge in English,so it was probally made in another country.Mexico,I think.It's just a bad Christmas film,and it would be very disturbing to kids.It's just very strange.Although there are some funny moments.Especially when Satan tells the demon that he'll be punished by being forced to eat ice cream if he fails in his mission lol But overall,the movie is really bad....unless you wanna have a good laugh or two.If you want a REALLY good laugh,pick up SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS instead,and leave this one alone."
2,Was not a good buy,Not what I excepted. The two songs were only instrumental.Next time I will considered buying the complete album with all the lyrics.
3,didnt help,I have have flat feet and a thing calleda navicular accesorry. Basically its just a long word for major extra bone growth in my foot along with flat feet. I bought this product to help...but my foot just flatten it due to the extra bone
1,Less of a comedy; more of a farce.,"This is the kind of movie that gives ""gay film"" a bad name. Homewrecker clearly feels that a camp sensibility pardons every sin the film commits, or that the camp label means that quality is completely superfluous. This movie is self-indulgent, poorly written, poorly acted (read that again: poorly acted. I'm serious.), and amateurishly edited. It has a couple of sexy scenes with its out-of-shape ex-porn star star, and I think that's the only reason it got a distribution deal.I saw Homewrecker at a film festival in November of 2009, and by the end of the film the whole audience started walking out, even though the director was still up on stage doing a Q and A.The only market this film will have is gay guys who will rent anything gay-themed and don't care how poorly done and just plain stupid it is.If my own gag reflex weren't so thoroughly deadened, I would have walked out of this film long before the lame ending."
1,This CD is AWFUL,"What the heck is this? Arturo needs to stick to what he knows and knock off all the synthesized cheese. There are no screams, and no blazing bop lines. Don't waste your money. Arturo, if you read this, let me know before you make another CD like this, so I can ask amazon.com for a lower rating that 1 star. And get back to stuff like your DREAM COME TRUE album, which was really tight. You are an awesome musician, don't sell out!"
5,Classic Trek at it's best,"I am very surprised Frank Gorshin was never asked to return as a baddie in another Trek episode. It was a real treat to see him argue with Shatner about the plight of their planet. You couldn't tell who was on the right side. Both of them had a convincing argument. There was no way to tell. Anyway, the episode did have another great action sequence where both of them wrestled with 60's style cosmic powers."
5,For shame! This is a CLASSIC!,"This episode was one of the most effective, memorable, and well-acted episodes of the original (and still best) series. It has a good plot and good symbolism, and it has very strong performances from the guest stars.P.S. Frank Gorshin is God. I am meeting him in person at an upcoming play! :o)"
2,why would I buy this?,why would i buy an opera CD without being able to preview the songs first like every other CD. I will not take a chance and buy this now.
2,I want the ORIGINAL version of this film,"There are two version of this movie. In the original version of ""Smokey and the Bandit 3"", Jackie Gleason plays the Bandit *and* the Sheriff. It is VERY strange. I saw it in the original theatrical release. They pulled it and remade it soon afterwards because it confused audiences.The original needs to be seen. It is bizzare, but work being seen just because of the schizophrenic nature of Jackie Gleason's performance.It is even meantioned in ""Bill and Ted Go To Hell"" (aka ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"".)If anyone is listening, please release the original version on widescreen DVD. It needs to be seen!"
1,Smokey and the Bandit 3,"This movie was an insult to the viewer and the talent of a great performer(Gleason). Even Jackie Gleason's tremendous comedic talent couldn't save this turkey. Jerry Reed's a pretty good singer, he should keep at it, because without Burt Reynolds to play to, he's lost as an actor. The entire cast was cardboard, no zest, it was as though they were trapped in a contract and were doing their least to fulfull it. The plot was weak, if not non-existent. The stunts were boring and ill-timed. The video was a waste of money and not worth watching, unless you like the 10 seconds of T&A in the nudist camp. I didn't. Smokey and the Bandit was a good ""B"" car chase movie and deserves the kudos it got. They should have took the money and run because it's been all down hill with the sequels."
5,How about a seperate DVD release?,"I recently bought the Smokey and the Bandit Pursuit Pack, mainly for the first two. I had no idea that they made a thrid one. Now that I have seen it, I wish the Universal would set out a singular DVD release."
2,HUGE WATCH,"This was a huge watch. The picture does not do it justice.If I weighed about 300 lbs, it may look appropriate on me, but for my above average build, it makes me look tiny even at 5""11 and 185Be careful, itll rip your arm hair out with its extensive weight, although if it was represented with actual size screenshot, it may look discouraging to all buyers"
3,From Shipwreck to Nantucket,"In Blair Lent's salty text and marvelously live illustrations the whale carries homesick John Tabor from South Sea island, where he has been shipwrecked, over the ruins of a city beneath the sea, past the Cape of Good Hope, past a fog-shrouded lighthouse manned by an unexpected crew, and into the very streets of Nantucket. The rollicking fun in this unusual picture book includes a most remarkable traveling companion and an encounter with Neptune himself."
1,About the use of certain words...,"While I do not like the work of Susan Johnson, I feel obliged to defend her use of certain vulgarisms in this book about the Regency era. The F word is known to have been in use since the 1400s. Back then, it meant to destroy or spoil. Its use to describe the act of copulation has been in existence since the late-1600s. The C word is even older than the F word, and has been in use since the early 1300s. So, contrary to what various reviewers have said previously, Ms. Johnson IS entirely accurate to have Regency era characters use these words, vulgar as such may be.Information about the historical appearance of English words is available in the book, English through the Ages, by William Brohaugh. It was published in 1998 by Writers Digest Books."
2,not the book it could be,"I was disappointed. This book bears no relation to the earlier, wonderful Johnson books. It's her second in a row that lacks both character development and plot. I too love her steamy sex scenes, but they have to be built up to. These aren't."
1,Definitely disappointed,"I found this book showed so little plot and so much vulgarity that I could not get past the first few chapters. Whether the terminology is or is not correct for the period, it does nothing to enhance the book's plot or story line; therefore, I see no justification in using these ""words"" in the story. Over the last 40 years I have read anywhere from two to five books a week and this is the first time I have thrown out a book without reading the end. Not only would I not read it, I was ashamed to pass it to my friends."
1,Disappointment,"I was highly disappointed in this book. I remember reading Susan Johnson's beginning books (starting with Sinful) and there used to be some plot with enjoyable characters. The love scenes were steamy, but yet romantic. This book was pure sex and the plot was very weak. I skimmed through most of the book and that didn't take very long, that I returned it the very same day. So unless you enjoy just reading the sex scenes, this will be enjoyable for you, if not then stay clear."
2,Cannot really recommend this diet.,"This falls in the ""diets don't work"" file. I cannot say it is based on anything more than common sence.Actualy a doctor told me about it and then having read it I couldn't figure why he put any stock in it at all.I recommend the old standard. Eat less, exercise more. If you do it then it works...rather simple and basic. Save your money on this one."
2,Foods might be delicious but at what price?,Took one look at the food combinations and I knew this book was going to make me sick.Starches and sugars = alcohol in the digestive track = a lot of gas = pain.And it might be better than eating junk food.
5,perfect,"i bought this for my daughter's room. it was very easy to assemble (i did it myself while my husband was at work.) the box does weigh 84 lbs~fyi. while it does work in her bedroom, it would work best in a larger bedroom or a family room. her 20"" tv is a little small (i put some picture frames around it to compensate.) thought the size description might be helpful, even with dimensions listed it is hard to imagine the actual size in a room. it is beautiful and i'm very glad i made this purchase!"
5,amazing book,"This is one of the very few books which keep you hanging till the end. The style of writing is amazing , the emotions are conveyed so clearly that i can almost feel them. Especialy the last scene when the Julian comes out with his frustation and doubts about the Isobel's's amnesia and the way the Isobel struggles with the returning memories and the entire scene you can almost see it happening in front of you with the emotions clogging your throat.Way to go i wish Amazon could provide kindle version of all her books ..."
3,"Interesting, but not for everyone","This book was interesting, but is not for the casual reader. Kuhn's condensed summary of pre-Copernican cosmology is still too technical for many readers; I found some passages difficult to slog through myself. Many of his insights and connections were wonderfully interesting, but I was a little disappointed that after the long, technical build-up there wasn't a little ""more"" there. Usually a book that leaves you wanting more is a sign of a satisfying read, but although I enjoyed this book and found it enlightening in many places, in this case my wanting ""more"" was because I wasn't quite satisfied by it."
5,Interesting book,"Unlike 'the Structure of Scientific Revolutions', this book is well-written and informative, if you want to know about the development of ancient astronomy. Belongs with serious, entertaining and informative books on the history of science like those by Hoyle (who explains what Copernicus really did) and Barbour (who pointed me to Hoyle in the first place)."
1,terrible leaky boots for lots of money,"I purchased the Hunter original Welly's and initially was very pleased with them. Six months later they sprung a leak, and upon examination they were crazing and splitting everywhere they flexed. I had expected many years wear for the price, but a quick search of the internet showed that many were experiencing the same problem and that the original company had been sold. These are fashion boots, not rain boots or working in the garden boots, or mucking out stalls boots and they will last for months, not many years, as they once would."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought a pair of these last summer. The piece at the top to tighten the calf broke within a week. I used super glue to repair this, but they never should have broken - especially since I do not tighten them up at all. I was told of the wonderful quality, but I would not buy again or recommend. They do look nice, but many other companies are now making a nicer looking rubber boot at a better price. Look around and you will find something much nicer with better quality."
5,Hands down most under-rated band ever ....,"...Not much more needs to be said. As for 'A Happy Pocket', it's probably one of my most treasured disks. They are coming on tour in the US in September 2004 and releasing a new album. If it is anything like 'Pocket', it should be one unbelievable album."
4,very good,"I bought this as a gift for a friend, who reported it was very satisfying. I'm not going to give the plot away and you can read the movie description. When I borrowed and watched it, I too had the same feeling. Aaaah."
5,Amazing Zen Fable,This is a very well written Zen fable. It is told in 5 vignettes (one for each season mentioned in the title. I suggest that you go without anyone telling you too much about it. It is such a simple and elegant story that any previews will give it away.
4,Thought provoking ...,"This is a wonderful parable movie from Korea. The premise is about leading a selfless, non-violent, spiritual and simple life. The passing seasons are a metaphor for phases in a man's life.The subtle lessons showing redemption by indulging oneself in sheer selfless hard work were most inspiring. Another inspiring story is of a little kid who ties a toad to a stone and a fish by a long twine. The fish dies and the kid's master punishes him by tying a a heavy grind stone around his back and have him walk uphill. In today's modern world we all seem to have forgotten some basic principles and this movie is a gentle reminder that helps us connect to our higher consciousness.From an aesthetic sense the movie has been shot brilliantly. The mountains, the floating house, the open gates and the wonderful camera angles."
5,Beautiful and amazing!,"I have heard about this film for years and never saw it. It is so beautiful and amazing, and every bit as good as I could ever have expected. A great cultural capsule."
3,Worth watching,"This is not a typical film, it delves into Buddhist philosophy and can take you to far away places... a good film"
2,A really weird movie,"I really cannot understand all these high ratings for this movie. To me it really does not make a lot of senses. Yes it did leave me speechless after watching this movie, but more a puzzled type of wonder because I really do not know what this movie tries to say. I wonder if even the Koreans will like this movie themselves."
5,Exact Match,"I had purchased this item at a local hardware store ,when I went back for more they told me theyno longer carried it. I was glad to see you had the exact same product. Thanks for helping to finish ourproject."
1,Rakosh Rip-Off,"Mr. Wilson.... you should be ashamed of yourself. Based on the enjoyment I derived from reading all of the ""Jack"" series, I ordered this rip-off. Buyers Beware!"
2,cheaply made and wrong order,"I ordered a canopy from a seller (still talking to them so I am not posting their name). The canopy was supposed to have daisies and ribbons. I got this instead. Hopefully this will get resolved.However, this canopy is pretty flimsy. The hoop is a thin metal strip with a clasp that does not really hold the thing together - you can easily slide it in and out. The hoop is also really huge. I got another canopy from Home collection - a blue one with basketballs and the quality is completely different. That one has smaller, thick hoop coated with white paint. It's also solid so there is no chance the thing will come crashing on my kid."
2,'The Moon Revisited' - Pink Floyd Tribute (Magna Carta),"Not that bad of a tribute CD,but as for myself,I'd REALLY prefer to listen to the actual Floyd lp.'The Moon Revisited' is basically nine different unknown artists that cover one track each of the famed 'Dark Side Of the Moon' album.If you're a major,and I do mean MAJOR Floyd nut,you may get more out of this CD than I did.The track ""The Great Gig In The Sky"" about had me nearly crying for mercy,the woman vocalist just goes on and on.... To put it another way,'The Moon...' is like a Pink Floyd cover band.Tunes like ""Speak To Me"",""Brain Damage"" and ""Eclipse"" are okay,at best."
5,Better than expected.,I was expecting a rough iron shot like a cheap practice one at a local high school. I bought the 16 lb shot of which they don't have a picture. What I received was much better than I expected. It had a blue paint like finish and was very smooth for being cast iron. And weighed a perfect 16 lbs.
4,Best 4-cup available,"When my beloved Krup 4-cup coffee maker broke -- my fault, not its -- I tried to replace it with another. No luck! No longer made.The replacement choices were few and we were never happy with the Mr. Coffee that we have in our motorhome -- not because of performance but, rather, it's ugliness because it's white and has ugly stains.The black Mr. Coffee that we ordered makes great coffee and looks good too. The only downside: its round glass carafe has a small opening and is harder to hand-wash than the straight-sided carafe on our old Krups."
5,tiny and adorable,"We had a Mr Coffee machine that was twice this size for a good 10 years (great quality) but it took up too much room on our counter. I saw this and had to get it (especially during black friday's deals) and realized it was a 4 cup but didn't realize how small it was. Its adorable! Takes up almost no room, its perfect for what we need. Love it!"
2,"Makes a good cup of coffee, but easily broken","This coffee maker is good enough for the price. It makes a decent cup of coffee, and gets the job done. However, mine mysteriously broke for no apparent reason after about 3 months. One day it just stopped turning on. Again for the price it's probably not a huge shock, but I'd suggest spending an extra 10 dollars and finding a model that won't fall apart on you so quickly."
3,alright!,"Was expecting a permanent filter basket as it appeared it is included.Also, for making only one cup, the coffee is not really very strong. Though in sometime I'll be able to hopefully perfect the technique."
1,you'll be sorry,"I bought this thinking it was the new version of the one I bought five years ago. Same price but without the auto shut-off, the clock and the pre-set function. All this has is ""on and off"" button. That's it...AND the coffee pot is such a horrible design that when you pour liquid from it - it spills all over the counter. I saw that the model I had before is still available and cost a dollar LESS! You'll be sorry if you buy this when you can get one with all the other functions for cheaper."
4,Amazing pot for the price.,"My ex left a boutique coffee pot when she moved out. I tried making a pot of coffee one morning only to have the pot puke its guts all over my kitchen floor 3 times. Hot water and coffee grounds are a real pain in the rear to clean off counter top, down a cabinet face and out of the cracks and crevices in hardwood flooring. Needless to say I was upset. That coffee pot was summarily executed in the backyard with a pistol. The neighbors weren't too happy about it but screw them, I have a gun.I went to Walmart and purchased the cheapest coffee pot they had, which happened to be this one. My first pot of coffee turned out fantastic. I drink about 5 cups a morning so this is the perfect size for me. The only suggestion is to pour slowly otherwise you'll get dribbles down the side of the pot as you pour. That really rustles my jimmies but I can deal with it for the price."
1,Wanted to like it...,"After my Braun coffee maker broke, I was looking for a cost-effective, smaller coffeemaker and chose this one. BIG MISTAKE! The coffee it brews tastes terribly bitter, and I haven't been able to find a way to avoid this. The coffeemaker is too cheap to bother paying return shipping to Amazon, so I've just wasted money that could have gone to a better product. Lesson learned!9/5/2011-An update: after a few months of dealing with this Mr. Coffee coffeemaker, I shipped it off to Goodwill and got myself a serious coffeemaker that I love! Not anywhere near the same price bracket, but if you are looking for good coffee and only need a machine for 1 coffee drinker, this is perfect: Zojirushi EC-DAC50 Zutto 5-Cup Drip Coffeemaker."
2,Not great for HOT coffee lovers,"I just purchased this coffee maker and I was very excited to use it in my office at work. Unfortunately it does not make a very hot cup of coffee (at least mine did not). After being disappointed by my first mugs temperature, I decided to let the second serving sit on the hot plate for a while, hoping that would make it hotter. Sadly it was even cooler after 40 minutes of sitting. So, while the taste of the coffee was nice, the temperature was not. I returned it right away. :("
2,I hate the taste of Mr. Coffee's coffee!,"This is the second Mr. Coffee machine I've had recently. I had a larger one and didn't like it because the coffee it brewed was bitter. Got this 4 cup which is a perfect size for one person. Same problem, bitter bad tasting coffee. I cleaned the pot with a good cleaning agent and the bitterness improved for maybe a couple of pots. Now it is back. I beginning to get the feeling that unless I clean the machine at least once a week or maybe twice a week I am going to be drinking bitter terrible tasting coffee. This is a lot of hassle to be constantly cleaning the machine just to get a decent cup of coffee. I hate this brand!"
1,I hate this coffee maker--cannot pour from the pot without spilling,I never leave reviews but this coffee maker is TERRIBLE. Cannot pour from the pot without spilling. It's not just me. Others come to my house and try to use it and our counter is constantly soaked. I hate it.
3,A Good Book to Accurately Portray History,"I, too, thought this book was more deserving of bad reviews. It is not an action-packed, suspensful book, so if one is looking for that, this is not the book to read. I read this book for a course in graduate school and thought it would be appropriate to read to children to teach them about what frontier life was really like. I also think it's a keystone book to use to teach about internal conflict, as this book was centered on a large internal conflict. Finally, I think it's an easier-to-read book because it focuses mainly on one character's point of view, thoughts, and actions. There are other characters with whom Ann interacts, but the book focuses mainly on Ann."
4,Ann's Adventure,"The book Cabin Faced West is about when Ann's family becomes pioneers. She goes throught a lot of changes.For example, she doesn't have any friends any more. She has 3 brothers,a baby brother named Jhonny Cakes,and two other brothers named David and Daniel. David and Dainel made a rule up. The rule was if you complain you will get a bucket of spring water on your head! IF you read this book you will find out who gets the water on them. In the middle and end of the book two special people come. Ann didn't really like Hamilton Hill but the two special people made her feel better and now she likes Hamilton Hill. You will be surprized when you read the postscript. It is a really good book you should read it!!"
3,The Cabin Faced West,"In my class at Isbister Elementary, we have book groups. We have to read a book with our group out of the 6 choices. The first time we got assigned books. My book was The Cabin Faced West. I read the book twice. Here's what it's about:Ann Hamilton is a young girl from the same time period as the Revolutionary War.She and her family,Ma,Pa,David,and Daniel,live in a log cabin. The men do the hunting and Ma and Ann do the cooking and cleaning. Ann has a neighbor named Andy McPhale. He's a rotton little boy,as Ann thinks. She later becomes friends with him. She teaches him how to write.Ann keeps a diary in her room. She writes in it every ay by the road. ""The road has a magical glow today"",she said one day. Her Ma had sent her to go pick grapes. Thats when she says it. She then hers horses and people. She hides in the tall grass. A man said""May you tell me what your mother has prepared for your evening meal?"" She tells him.Then she finds out it's ..."
5,Outstanding read!,"I found this book incredibly interesting, insightful, and thought-provoking. I think it's very important to think actively about what contributes to positive/negative vibes in any close relationship and this book really helped me do that, even as a happily married woman! I am recommending this book not only to friends in troubled relationships/marriages but also to many single friends who have recently entered serious relationships - the first chapter really should be required reading for life for everyone, full stop. I urge a purchase, you won't be disappointed."
1,Disappointing and Bothersome,"Although I did find this book to be helpful from a self confidence standpoint, this was a strange read. The authors come across as very self absorbed and insecure. I felt like I was reading Sex and the City for divorcees. I think a chapter on attempting to reconcile the differences you and your spouse might be experiencing would go a long way. This book gives you absolutely no hope and makes divorce sound like a positive thing. I once had many of the same feelings (or lack there of) that the women in this book describe, but I found it in me to work out things with my spouse. I have never felt stronger and more in love. What we went through was very difficult, but I cannot imagine my life without my spouse. In our world today, it much easier for a woman to walk away from a marriage than it was in the past. This can be a good thing, but also a very bad thing. I almost gave up to soon and I know and I know others who have. Many of them regret their decisions."
2,You've Gotta Be Kidding Me...,"The Misfits without Danzig, what?! This has to be some kind of joke. Come on, Danzig is the only reason why anyone knows who The Misfits are and without him this band is garbage. Famous Monsters is a complete joke and sounds nothing like original Misfits. Jerry is a moron for bringing the Misfits back without Danzig, he could've at least shown some respect and used a different name. These old farts are just trying to milk The Misfits name for all its worth and with this kind of crap they are ruining the legacy of what was once a good band."
4,Last gasp of a great American band,"Now that we're nearly 10 years out from the release of this album, I can say it's one that has stood the test of time. While the Newfits never had a passion behind their lyrics as Danzig did, they had the licks and the ability to craft catchy, memorable songs.You have to remember this album almost never happened. After the initial reunion tours in 1995 through 1997, The Misfits nearly collapsed several times due to internal squabbles, notably Michale Graves leaving the band for a short time in 1998. As horrible as everything eventually turned out for this band (Jerry Only turned into an ego maniac, Doyle was slowed by injury, Graves turned into a laughable Conservative punk), Famous Monsters managed to channel the goofy, comic book vibe that was missing from American Psycho."
1,Admit it....this is not the Misfits,"First off, i have to say, that I don't think this is a horrible cd and I don't think that this is a horrible band. There's no denying that Doyle and Jerry Only were key components of the Danzig-era Misfits; yet, for this band to call themselves the Misfits, and even worse, have fans applaud them and their releases, is insane. once again, i don't think this band sucks, far from it, but without Danzig it's not the Misfits but rather a second, no, third rate version of the Misfits trudging along and trying to recap what the band once was. Without the Key ingredient, the primary creative force of the orignial band, this is nothing more than a disgrace to the Misfits name. Face it folks, it's like trying to bake a cake without flour...."
2,Blah!,"this is the worst misfits album ever, yes, even worse than american psycho. it's upbeat and peppy, sure some old misfits stuff was, but not entire recordings, michale graves sings like he's in a classic rock band. chud is a good drummer tough. this pales in comparison to any of the earlier recordings. in my eyes the misfits died in 1983, when Danzig left. Jerry Only just can't carry them himself. if you want to hear the REAL misfits i suggest Earth AD?wolfsblood or Static Age."
3,No Change from American Psycho,"I would say this is just a sequel to American Psycho. It has some tracks that are excellent like ""Scream!"" ""Descending Angel"" and ""Helena"", but the album as a whole is nothing extraordinary. I won't even compare this to the Danzig-era, which was the REAL MisFiTs...I see this as a different band. It is by no means a bad album, but it's by no means a great one either."
1,Misfits are still cool,"Hey now, the Misfits are all good, but this album isnt. Although Helena is ok, the rest of the stuff is incredibly catchy and crappy. The lyrics are stuck in my head and they suck. Doyle and Jerry kick ass, but Michales a pansy and so is Chud. I liked the Misfits more when I had an album that was crap quality, amazing lyrics and the only picture of the band was so warped you couldnt even tell who was who. Just buy the Samhain and Misfits boxsets and thank god Michale left the band"
2,Ugh...,"Without Danzig the misfits should call themselves something else. Its just not the Misfits without him. And i know bands move on and everything when band members leave, but take Guns n Roses for instance. The band left and Axl had to reform, but without slash and duff its just not GNR anymore. Danzig didnt start his solo career and call it the Misfits because it wouldnt be; not without all of its key players involved. I wouldnt recommend this cd, its blasphemy to the Misfits name."
4,Famous Monsters - Round II A.G. (after Glenn),"I'm not even going to get into the new Misfits vs. the old debate. I've been a Misfits fan since the beginning so obviously I'm into Glenn, but with an open mind I must say that Famous Monsters is awesome. Michale Graves really shows his stuff on this album, much more so than on American Psycho, which I also liked. ""Scream"" is a great song, as is ""Dust To Dust."" ""Saturday Night"" is pretty different for them, but it works great. They're better than ever live and I look forward to their future albums and tours. Long Live the Fiends!!! By the way, does anyone else think it's ironic that they debuted at number 138 on Billboard?!"
2,This is not that good.,"Being a huge fan of the Misfits I was not all too dissapointed with the previous album, American Psycho but this one is kind of blah. The first couple songs are decent but are kind of poppy sounding in a bad way. I mean the Danzig era Misfits were kind of poppy at times but this album is like Blink 182 poppy. But there are some good songs like Forbidden Zone, The Crawling Eye, and Saturday Night. These are however destroyed by the horrible ""Fiend Club,"" and ""Them."" If you feel compelled to buy this in support of Jerry Only then do it, however it does not stack up to any Danzig era Misfits material, and not even to American Psycho. Buy the box set instead."
3,"OK, but it is not the real thing and we all know it...","There are some good sing-a-long songs on this record just the way the old Misfits did it. But the abscence of Glenn Danzig, the obvious sell-out aura surrounding the band's activities and the general plastic feel of the whole project makes me sad.I strongly recommend that anyone interested in the catchy punk format check out the old Misfits and Ramones instead.All in all the record makes for some good party music given that any of the party guests aren't aware of the existence of the old Misfits :)"
3,"review of ""Grillz"" DVD",This DVD sucks. It actually follows TV Johnny(Paul Wall's business partner) around while he shows you step by step how the grillz are made. To me thats boring. The other DVD they have out is better because they actually show music videos. Get this DVD if you wanna how to make grillz otherwise I recommend getting the other DVD which is called (TV Johnny & Paul Wall Shine Like the Stars)
5,More than conquerors,These are must-see messages. Cheryl has an incredible gift of teaching that both exhorts and challenges you. She encourages women to be strong in the faith--how to be victorious and joyful all in the midst of trials. You can watch this on DVD (which I prefer) or listen to the messages on MP3. And it even comes with homework you can print to get even more out of the lessons.
5,Even Better than his first,"First off, You should know that this isn't any more primitive than school Bus. The main differences are that Trike has a much Tighter sound than school bus, and it is also bluesier and Log's vocals play a smaller role. Trike focuses mainly on Log's slide guitar playing, which in my opinion sounds much better than on school bus. All together, trike makes for an increadibly fun listen. And once agian this is an essential electric slide listening."
1,Poor time between ordering and shipment.,"I purchased this item on December 19th. I realized it would not make the Christmas day arrival, however, I still have not received it and the site says they are ""in stock"", why is it taking until January 25th? I now have another notice that it won't even arrive until after January 30th. Don't expect to receive your order on time. It is really annoying and disappointing to my son, as I promise every week it is on its way."
4,totally entertaining,"A friend recommended the fever series to me a couple of weeks ago and I blew through all five books in ten days. Absolutely loved them. Moning writes in a way that makes it so easy to visualize everything down to the smallest detail. She also writes exciting well rounded female and male characters. It was fun following Mac's progression from a pretty, fluff of a girl to a kick butt woman in each book. Wish Moning was writing another book in the series!"
3,They hook you and pull you along,"They give you the first book and then drag it out for several books in the series--never coming to an end. I've read the first three, which could easily be combined into one book (the author spends about 1/4th of each book explaining plot and character development from the previous books).Kindle should smoosh them together for one low price. Although I want to know what happens in the last two books, I don't want to spend my $ on two more books that should be one."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Yes, I'll admit it: I was stalling on buying this book ever since I heard it was not a romance at all. I suppose I could forget the highlanders for a while, they were sort of getting redundant...ok, I'm lying here...but I finally broke down, needing my KMM fix after so long, and bought Darkfever. It had me instantly intrigued and I turned pages until I couldn't keep my eyes open only to reach for the book again come morning. Our beloved author has embarked on a delightfully interesting new series with great characters and a clever and intricate plotline. The first person tone of the book took some getting used to as this is not KMM's typical writing style, but she has proven that she is a wonderful author no matter how she tells her tale. Now the long wait until the next installment comes out..."
5,Way Good!!!,"This was a great book for me. i am new to Moning, but I am looking forward to the next book."
3,"Good writting, good story.","I grabbed the Kindle version of this book. I have to say it was very well written. I like the flow, and main character is likable and believable. I would be happy to give this book 5 stars and buy the rest of the series except I did not care for the scenes between Mac and the ""death by sex"" Fae. I can only assume there will be more like that in future books. Its a shame to because if those scenes were cut from the story it would not hurt the story at all, would not have even been missed. Reading on the authors web site tells me she plans more of that in future, so I will move on.This is my first book I have read by this author, so I assume this is typical for her.Again, her writing is great, and it is a great tale, so if you do not mind being in the mid of a young girl as she deals with a ""death by sex"" Fae, then you might really enjoy these books."
3,Not what I expected,"This book was recommended to me by a friend, I picked it up expecting a great mystery/romance story. Once I started reading I was annoyed with the main character immediately with her love for pink-everything was pink. Once they introduced Barrons-who I am expecting at some point to be her love interest-I was hoping the story would get better, but it didn't. He refers to her as Ms. Lane (her last name) every other sentence, after a while he started to annoy me as well. I will read the next book in hopes of seeing why so many people love this series. I just wasn't impressed with the first book, I hope my view of this series changes because I really did want to like it. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't terrible and I was able get through the book and didn't just put it down without getting to the ending."
5,Superb Read,"This book is a great read. I'm hooked, and can't wait for the next book in the Fever Series..."
4,Took a sec for me to adapt...,"This story was very good, but it takes a moment to adjust to Mac's curse word language and the fae words that are thrown about in this book. Once I got past that, I was hooked. I really, really enjoyed it. V'lane, Barrons, Mac, the dark fae all of them were so interesting.I enjoyed seeing Mac come into her own, learn how to fight, grow up a bit from the prissy, southern rainbow mac that we are orginally introduced to. The story ended on such a cliffhanger that I immediately started Bloodfever and read 216 pages the very same day."
4,believable heroine in a paranormal story,"When I started reading this book, I was waiting like everyone else for some smoldering romance. I still haven't seen it yet, but the adventures and description of the places and people are well done. Contrary to the other reviewers who hated Mac for being shallow, I thought it was kind of refreshing. Because all the heroines who always seem to be good looking and you never read about them putting on make-up or being concerned about their look really seem to get on my nerves. Granted, it is a novel, so the good looking guy is always ridiculously good looking (and I am happy about it), but since the books are mainly read by women, I personally can relate to the main character who is concerned about her nail polish color being an issue :)because I think sometimes its the little familiar things that keep us going."
5,I'm glad I wasn't introduced to the series until all the books were out,"This was a great series, the first novel will pull you in and you have to read them all. If you don't enjoy the fantasy genre I would not suggest this book to you. I am a huge fay fan so this book was fantastic.I have read other reviews complaining that this was not a romance. These books are totally different than the Highlander series the author wrote. Don't expect any romance until the 4th and 5th book in the series."
3,Avid Reader,"It took me pretty much an afternoon to read this book. I must say it is much better than the last two books by this author and I am happy that its not the same old boring time travel oversexed formula we expected.The story is interesting, but also very short and I can agree with some of the other reveiwers - I hate the cliffhanger at the end and at $13 a pop, I feel somewhat cheated.I was not impressed by Mac, the whole blonde, beautiful, innocent thing I didn't really buy. I liked the character of Barrons loved the whole ""fae"" world/underworld, so it made the reading bearable.I'm not so sure I will purchase the next chapter in Mac's story but I would like to see what happens next."
1,3 days I will never get back,"This book was neither thrilling nor romantic in any way. ""Ms. Lane"" is a bubble headed annoying protagonist and I prayed for her demise many times. I can only hope that the plethora of foreshadowing in this opening series will eventually lead to something, but alas, I will not be reading another Fever book to find out. I feel the $1.99 I paid was $2.00 too much. I generally devour 300 pages in less than a day, but I choked on this book for 3 days, hoping something good would come of it. The writing is so superficial and terribly redundant. My husband asked while I was reading if it was a roller coaster & I told him it wasn't even a merry-go-round. Bottom line...skip it."
4,Great beginning to series,I read lots of paranormal and I thought this book was really good. The good guys are interesting and the monsters are bad. It does have a cliffhanger but by now the series is finished so all the books are out so you don't have to wait. I already have the four other books in my wait pile because I knew I was going to really like this book and I do.
5,YEAH!,"This book was an accidental download and last night I decided to read it. I finished it today & before I go & download the 2nd, I just wanted to say I am so excited to have a new series to read. I truly like the characters and story line is fresh. I live in Roswell (GA), so what a trip to see the Mac was from Georgia and to read some down home slang. It always thrills me to find an author who can write some good books, with a heroine who kicks ""petunia"", and by luck there are several in a series that I can read and get caught up to and then be miserable like everyone else waiting on the next one to come out. Love it!"
2,Wasn't prepared....,"After reading the whole Highlander series of novels--(And I have read them all--several will always be favorites) -- I was expecting romance and a challenging plot--I got the challenging plot--but I wasn't expecting a mystery/thriller with nothing more then foreplay by imagination and a little old kiss--not even really decribed at the end....Yes, I was disappointed! I didn't buy this book because I was looking for a mystery/thriller---I would have enjoyed it anyway if it had smacked even a little of romance.....I will be leery of the next publication. . . unfortunately Ms. Moning has moved on to a sphere of entertainment I'm not overly interested in.Why the cover--with two naked people on it--when these two never got naked at all...Why wasn't the genre of this book stated openly on the cover--instead the reviews on the back were all about romance...it made for a very misleading sales pitch for this book..and I find THAT very disturbing."
2,It's not supposed to be Romance...,"DarkfeverEDITED REVIEW: 4 StarsI was expecting ROMANCE and I didn't get it. I bought this not knowing KMM had said this series wouldn't be the romance series of the Highlanders. It does, however paralell the Highlanders. The character, Mac, is a fru fru southern girl, not altogether annoying more like cluless. Being a southern girl myself, I get her. Barrons is a brooding Alpha Male that isn't easy to deifne. Mac's sister has been murdered and she goes to Ireland only to learn there's more to life the pink nail polish, and accessorizing an outfit. If you are expecting romance, look elsewhere, but do give it a chance. I am not disappointed in this book since I now know what the series is supposed to be. This series gets better, and the Keltar men begin making an appearance in the second book Bloodfever. It is a lot darker than what she normally writes, but it was written really well. Give it a chance and hopefully I've given you enough to know what to expect."
2,Value for your dollar,"I do not want to say I didn't like the book at all since I enjoy Karen's writing so much, but I was so disappointed. I am afraid ""fever"" is one series I will not be reading unless I find the books in a second hand store. I didn't find out anymore about the story at the end of the book then I did in the first few chapters. Mac sees fae objects and feas (good and bad). Jericho Barrins is either a good guy or the devil in disguise. Mac's sister is still dead and we don't know who killed her or where her journal is. I always pre-order all of Karen's books, but when the price is $20.00 per book I expect a complete story not a very long prologue. . Karen states this is the first of 5 books about the same story plot, $120 is way out of my budget for 5 incomplete stories."
1,Where's the Romance?,"I picked up this book looking for something that wasn't there at all. I thought this would be an interesting combination of two of my favorite genres, fantasy and romance. At no time at all did the main character have any sort of relations with any other character...not even a true friendship. The story was just okay. I have read books written for teenagers which had more depth and were more interesting than this book. I will never read one of her 'so-called' romances again."
5,could not stop reading,"I couldn't sleep one night and stared at my TBR pile. Darkfever has such a pretty cover that I decided to go for it. Thank god I bought this with book two! I haven't been able to put these books down. My cats have to start crawling on me and my husband has to put his arm around me, I'm that swept away. The writing, pacing and plot twists are addictive!Now on to Mac. Moning obviously wrote book one about a young woman having to grow up fast. She's a completely different person in book two. Don't lose faith in her, she grows a lot and it takes her a while to learn about this world.As for Jericho, he's the most intriguing character, I want more scenes with him! There's obviously some kind of history with him and V'lane. I wasn't sure whether to like V'lane or not, or even what his story was about. Guess I'll find out in future books! :)I'd like to add that it is refreshing to read a book that doesn't need a hookup or a happy ending/relationship/marriage."
2,"enough with the future flashes, we get it !","Maybe it is just me but I found the constant flashforward lines supremely annoying and they seemed to occur every few pages. You know, lines like ""I didnt know it at the time but it would turn out I would regret that move"" or""little did I know then just how wrong I was"" or ""..and that would be the last normal night of my life"". Ugh already, we get it! Interesting world and creatures and I want to know what happens next but not sure I could read another couple of these....."
2,DARKFEVER by Karen Marie Moning,"After waiting so very long for Ms. Moning's book, I was extremely disappointed. I found myself skipping pages looking for something as exciting as her Highlander series.There was no development of sexual tension or romance between the heroine and the hero. In order for the author to sell future books inthis new series the reader would have to be sold on this first one which I found to be very disappointing."
5,dickens on england,"This book is a delightful history of England. It is a book for all ages. As an adult I have enjoyed reading the book for pure pleasure. My two teenage daughters have used this book numerous times for school projects, especially for their history and compostion classes."
3,Good but not Great,"This was a good movie but was not good as the predators or as the aliens. This was better than I expected it was going to be, but it is not as good as Alien VS. Predator REQIUM."
1,*sigh* no one wins,"Reading the description immediately led me to ask...why are the Predators anywhere near the Antarctic? If one has watched any previous 'Predator' movie, (and who would watch this if they hadn't), then we already know that a point is made of the 'Predators' preferring the ""hottest summers"". AvP gets a rating of '1' for the background sets and props...that's it."
1,the movie that destroyed the franchise,"I still can't believe that Fox greenlighted this movie. Paul Anderson must be one of the worst directors ever.... This movie is all over the place with plot holes, horrible acting and even worse a PG-13 rating. Do not buy this movie..if you just have to see it rent it instead."
5,A great crossover between the alien and predator franchise,"The movie is about a discovery of an ancient pyramid that is buried beneath the ice of Antarctica sends a team of scientists to the continent. When they get there they find the alien and predator at war, with the people in their battle. This film has a great storyline that is very interesting to follow with. The aliens and predators look and move like they were real. AVP also has a lot of action that is sure to please anyone who likes action movies or just like the alien or predator movies. This 2 disc unrated has a lot of special features and extra scenes and also comes with a alien vs predator comic book. There is a suprise ending that there is going to be another movie. This is an excellent movie to add to your dvd collection as with any predator or alien movies."
4,spilt in the middle,You know what i'm gonna give it 4 stars because Alien & Predator were in it together HOWEVER the script could be a little better it was kind of so so for me but i was still entertain they are coming out with a sequel we can only pray it gets better not worse
2,Insult to Alien(s) everywhere,"I'm not exactly up to par with the Predator series but I watched both before seeing AVP. I know the Alien series better but thought I should at least watch P1 and P2 before seeing AVP.A few, well many, questions -- What's up with those ugly dreadlocks? Not even organic dreadloacks either. Why are they hunting humans first and Aliens later? Who are these guys and what's up with their bas a** selves?The pyramid idea was cool. The large cast, like JP2; nothing but fodder for later. Not even two characters I could care about coupled with the most insipid directing I've seen. No real motivation for characters, except as victims, no real story, no suspense, so style. Wrong choice for hero also, why try for a Ripley wannabe?It's just an insult to Alien and Aliens (even 3 and 4 stand better on their own). Rent this but don't buy it to put on your shelf with the Alien series. Also, this is not a prequel to Aliens at all - it's big studios making big bucks."
2,"Not quite as good as ""Freddy Vs. Jason"", but watchable","My first instinct is to report that this movie really isn't all that good, but when you think about it, how wonderful and subtle and artful could a movie called ""Alien Vs. Predator"" actually be? So, I'll be charitable and say that some of the scenarios are interesting (like the continually shifting walls in the pyramid where most of the story takes place) and many of the battles between the two alien species are cleverly staged and fairly fun to watch. Also, the DVD offers a slightly extended cut of the film in addition to the version offered in theaters, as well as some commentaries, so you get a good bit more than just a movie for your rental dollar or purchase price. Still, I wouldn't choose watching this film over actually going out and doing something. But, if it's raining outside and you'd be sitting home anyway, give it a whirl. It's a respectable time-passer."
1,It's Junk.....Exactly what it's supposed to be.,"Yes, the 13 year olds(and anyone older)who say this movie is ""totally awesome"" need to be beaten. But so do the NERDS who get angry over movies such as this one. First off, there are a lot more important things in life to get angry about than sequels to 20 year old films. If you do not understand this, you need to get a life. Granted the originals are classics of the genre but come on, what do you expect from a movie that is rehashing material for the 5th time.(By the way, all of you who just thought to yourself ""This movie isn't a rehash...it has both Aliens AND Predators"" your Morons)Second, even though the movie is a piece of crap, you can still enjoy it for the piece of crap that it is. Hate to blow your mind, but you can take the stick out of your a$$, sit back and have a good laugh at some bad filmmaking(All the while enjoying some pretty decent effects)."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This movie is like ""Jason vs Freddy""... it's so bad. Where is the creative buys??!! One more time, somebody lost the ideas. The producers MUST invest their money on movies as ""Lord Of The Rings"", amazing movies that the people want to see and enjoy!"
4,Great gift set,"This set comes with a bust of an Alien and a bust of a Predator. Each is a little over three inches tall, including a half-inch base. The version of the movie included is the common widescreen edition, not the unrated version.In conclusion, it doesn't have the most complete DVD edition, but the inclusion of not one, but two beautifully detailed busts makes it a nice addition to a sci-fi DVD collection."
4,"Flawed, yes, but fun.","!Heather's teenage son!I walked into the theater the day it was released with my expectations held high. I'd been wanting to see this film for almost a year and it had finally come out! Well, I was a little bit disappointed, but I still liked it.This film is so much better than Freddy vs Jason in soooo many ways. A better plot, a logical reason that the Aliens and Predators were fighting, and much better effects. The flaws were small, but noticable. For instance, the chestbusters do NOT come out as quickly as they did in the original Alien films and some of the CGI was fake looking. And it was rated PG13. There better be an unrated version of this released, because a PG13 rating for a movie like this is crap. The original 4 Aliens and 2 Predators were rated R. It was still enjoyable though. I really liked the lead actress. She was very convincing. Overall, this isn't the best in either series but still pretty good. I'm definately getting the DVD."
3,"'Alien' is Cool, 'Predator' a Puss","Forget ""Spiderman 2,"" this was the film I was looking so foward too. That was until I saw the TV spots and I heard those dreaded words, RATED PG13. My heart sank. How can a movie based on 2 hardcore R rated film series compromise itself with a lesser rating?The storyline was clever. The special effects were great. The alien was relentless in his pursuits. My problem lied with the Predator. (...) We want gore, blood, guts. Instead we get a friendly predator who makes nice-nice with a woman and they tag team the queen. Still, I enjoy seeing any monster movie. At least after many years of rumors, it was made. My main objection is that it could have been so much more. Maybe the sequel will go for it and not worry about attracting the teenie bop market. Oh, yes! Look out for the lamest ending. I mean, please. So much material in these legacys and that is the best they can do?"
2,AVP,"I walked into AVP with little expectation at all, just needing a couple scares before bed. Paul W.S. Anderson's film started too quickly and makes you feel like you are being brushed along like cattle. The film's ending is cheezy and extremely unoriginal. Terrible script, dialogue, and directing ruins the little known actors' attempts to lift this movie from a D grade. Music is terrible considering Alien's score won an Oscar and the photography is dark and murky. The editing helps this film a lot, very choppy and exciting.Directing- D+Photography- C-Music- C-Editing- BActing- D-Aliens- B+ Very scary, slimy, well done Stan Winston and Co.Predators- C+ Violent, scary without masks on, too corny at end of filmAction- B-Suspense- BStory Line and Plot- F No point to it and if there was who cares, the audience just wanted to see this creatures duel it out, not live in ancient pyramids under the ground!!!Movie- D"
1,"Well, That was a complete waste of time.",I will keep it short as I see there is already another 750 folk commenting on how bad this film ended up and the sad thing is this could have really been a great film but a poor story line made sure that never happened and having Predators that now seem to go out of their way to save the life of just one female from Aliens was just never going to work and at the end of the film where they almost holding hands I am sure if the film would have continued on for another half an hour we would of soon seen the girl and the predator getting married overall this is possible the worst film I have ever seen.
3,PG-13 don't cut it,"I was sorely disappointed with this film. The acting was horrible and plot was seriously lacking. But wait, I didn't pay to see an academy award nominee...I paid to see some action, blood, guts and alien on predator action. What I got was some PG-13 cut down gore and violence. I was also disappointed that the alien's didn't get more screen time but that's the way the cookie crumbles. I give it 3 out of 5 stars for at least some good action and I would seriously recommend renting this movie or wait till the director's cut comes out on DVD...other than that its a waste of money."
2,I cant beleive it's getting a sequel.,"When I saw the trailer for this, it really looked great. But when watching it you watch a bunch of humans find a place buried 100's of feet below ground and end up stuck in there as a war between the Aliens and the Predators begins. But the stupid thing is, the first half is setting up the charactors, then the next half they have been killed off before you've blinked and it's just focused on one person, one Predator and there partnership. (They may as well have given her and the Alien a love scene to put the nail in the coffin)There was too much charactor development to just off everybody suddenly and focus on the warriors from another world. The ending was completly predicted and it revealed nothing memorable or worth remembering.How does this crap end up with a sequel? ""we screwed up the first time, where gonnah try again, we only have have half a script, lets shoot it already"" (another flop in the making)"
3,Trailers Lie,Ok this movie like was half decent for the first half with not to shabby plot building but horrible character introduction. Throughout the whole movie it was like who just died? WHo's that guy? Just badly written. That and they just killed the people off soo quickly and somehow the aliens bred inside the humans in under two minutes whihc made no sense if you've seen the Alien movies. The worst part of this movie is this speech the main character (some black chick whos name i cant remember) whips out this whole like speech as to how to survive which she could've never just thought up liek that. Then for some reason the Predators band with the chick and dont just kill her? (i still dont know why) and they help her get out. Of course it all ends in perfect sequel setup fashion whihc i wont reveal cuz god knows ill get hate maildont see this movieu will hate the alien and predator franchises possibly as a result of seeing this or alien resurrection
1,AVP-Alien Vs. Predator (Blu-ray),"Why on earth bother bringing this title out on Blu-ray when it is still the original ""PG13"" watered down cut to the bone wishy washy version when the original directors cut unrated version is available in normal format?"
5,Alien Hunter 2,"I have to agree that Alien Vs. Predator the unrated version was much better than the PG-13 version. But that's hollywood. People running the business making bad decisions is flat out ridiculous. That need to grow up or quit while they're ahead. One other thing, sure Lance Hendrickson's character was human and his character was an android in Aliens, but people can't seem to notice the connection. The character Weyland's middle name was Bishop. In one scene he was on the cover of a magazine stating he was a designer in robotics. His descendant was the man in the third Alien film who created the android Bishop. Obviously naming it Bishop in tribute to his ancestor who was the pioneer in robotics."
1,AvP sucks!,"Paul W.S. Anderson is a crappy director, almost as crappy as Michael Bay. This movie should've been categorized as a comedy because I was laughing throughout the entire thing. There were tons of cheesy lines, not to mention the chick in the movie outlives the predators. This is one of those movies where you're laughing that it's so bad, so if that's what you're looking for then go see it. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Ehhh,"I don't absoultely dispise it like everyone else seems to, but its nowhere near as good as alien or predator"
2,The biggest problem with this movie is it's too dark most of the time,The biggest problem with this movie is it's too dark most of the time. I can hardly see things clearly. That makes it's very difficult for me to enjoy it. There are a lot of fighting and bloody scenes but there's no suspense at all. The first installment of Predator and the second of Aliens are much more engaging and suspenseful.It's worth renting for curiosity.
5,A great movie made excellent with this release.,This was a great movie when it was released but it left me with a bit of confusion as several key scenes were cut from the film very shortly before it's release. This special edition offers around 8 minutes of added footage ranging from extended scenes to brand new ones. This is the movie as it should be. Highly recomend to any Alien and or Predator fan.
1,One of the Worst Films of 2004!,Alien vs Predator a Film Action/Sc-Fi/Horror Fans have wanted to see for Years has Arrived...... Send It Back!Paul W.S.
