1,one of the worst written material on programming,"I am not sure how I begin but, one of the lousiest written book about programming I've every read. It's totally disorganised; the writer doesn't seem to know his audience; beginners? intermediates? what exactly? He begins with really advance topics, but suddenly jumps into really basics that mostly don't require any kind of skills. This's like start teaching mathematics with advice and ""tour"" on, I don't know, differential equations but, suddenly talk about multiplication table. No organisation and certainly not good for anybody with any level of IT skills. Sorry!"
3,Hmmmm ...,"Even in it's 9th printing, this (retail $45 soft-back!) book has far too many typos and errors in it than one would expect from the master of C++ himself. Was the book rushed to press or was Dr. Stroustrup simply bored?"
5,"An EXCELLENT C++ book, but not for the novice ...","This book is an excellent C++ book. However, it is not for the beginning C++ programmer. This should not be your first C++ book. It is an excellent reference and provides in-depth analysis of the STL. The good thing about this book is that it is platform independent; it covers the ANSI C++ standard."
3,Very Good Sound BUT LACKS SEVERAL CONVENIENCE FEATURES,"What it lacks is a remote control for this price, a battery back-up, the annoyance of waking you up if there is a short power shortage, the inconvenient place the button is for DST it can easily be hit when you wake up, and the inconvenience of setting anything on this when is dark room."
2,some spice in this that I do not like,This was very disappointing. I love to get blackened chicken and fish in restaurants. This tasted so different from anything I have had in a restaurant. Some spice in this was not good at all. I don't know what it was. I don't plan to use this again. :-(
2,This is NOT 18/10 stainless,"Hi I know for a fact that this is not 18/10 checked with reed and barton also you can find this set on qvc and it is 18/chrome....but it is pretty I just want people to know what they are buying ....check the back of your pieces if it is 18/10 it will say so ""stainless steel 18/10"""
4,heavyweight flatware,"solid, heavyweight flatware; only con could possibly be that they are too heavy. knives seem larger then others i have owned"
1,I can't believe I was forced to give this 1 star.,"I feel really bad that this kid has muscular dystrophy and is confined to a wheel chair, but come on. The poetry is bad. Adolescents have been writing sub-par poetry for years, so why now are we subjugated to this roller-sap peddling his garbage on every major talk show. Sigh."
5,i like polaris,they rock! yay! im so going to screem in my house at the top of my lungs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
3,How long should a belt last?,"I used this with regularity for about a year and a half, but there are no dedicated holes for the buckle pin (or whatever it's called), so now it's torn the webbing and the belt is done.Great while it lasted, but a good leather belt should last longer than this."
5,Tremendous game with plenty of replay ability,Tremendous game with plenty of replay ability - the game board is different for each match. Best if played with three or more players. The game is easy to learn and a normal match can be completed in 30 minutes. This game was by far the most popular venue at a recent gaming tournament I attended this summer [it attracted 120+ gamers]. It is a competitive strategy game that requires each player to interact/trade with each other to build settlements and win control of the Island.
4,Unsettling Setteles,"We have several in our family who have this game so that is why we purchased it. This is our first experience with this type of game. We found it difficult to learn and explain to new players. It is fun once you grasp the concept although we are not certain why you start the game as instructed, or why it is not more conducive to two players. It is much better played with at least three."
5,best game since monopoly!,this game is a great game if you like monopoly it takes about 2 hours to finish you have to stratagize very well to get all five resorces. Never play with two people because there is a robber in the game and you really don't have the choice where to put it if you have one other person playing with you. BUY THIS GAME you won't regret it!
5,A gift to game lovers,"I learned about this game in Germany. A few of my friends invited me to play a game one evening. I expected a sort of monopoly or such stuff and thought about a few hours of gaming. But then I was introduced to Settler of Catan. Well, we finished the last game around 6 o'clock in the morning. You see, I liked the game and I'm looking forward to play it again, especially with the expansion packs. If you play settler with 6 persons, the time efford is doubled but so is the fun. Buy this game, it is worth every cent of it. If you are sick of other games, this game will keep you up for several years."
3,More Hard Hat Harry Hokeyness,I've purchased six All About titles for my 2 1/2 year old. All but two are Hard Hat Harry episodes so my son is used to the silliness and bad acting. He enjoyed the Monster Truck episode and requests to watch it several times a week. He's only seen the Trucks episode once all the way through and did not like it.
1,Clunky and Slow,Lots of good ideas in this program but the mechanics drove me nuts... Loading Loading Loading... I am still waiting for Pirates III!
2,"Cute, but quality issues","I purchased the utensil holder, colander, scale and this coffee container from this line. The colander and coffee container were damaged."
2,Smells like OLD man,"I'm 24 years old, and this stuff smells like you walked into a retirement home and sniffed an old white guy in a wheel chair. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because 10.1 ounces for around 20 bucks is a pretty good deal. But then again the scent is like a mixture of incredibly old man - toilet water. Overall, it sucks."
1,Incorrect mat for vehicle,"Upon receipt of the product I quickly determined they were incorrect for my vehicle. Since they are a bulky, heavy item it was not cost effectiveto return them, so I elected to absorb the cost. Very untypical for Amazon to send an incorrect size, but they depend on their suppliers,so disappointing but understandable."
4,GOOD REFERANCE MATERIAL,I is a good reference book for marbles. A bit dis-jointed and hard to follow. Pictures are not as clear as some other referance material but book should be in a marble collectors library.
2,Sony Cassette Player,I have been a Sony junkie all of my life. Every cassette player I bought from the stationary styles to the Walkmans and even their CD players have all been top knotch quality. I even will not ever get a computer that is not a Sony Vaio the one I have now is a Vaio and all of these have made Sony proud. So that is why I got this player. But when I went to use it it was not (in my opinion) Sony quality. It has a very low tone quality and the casing is not good.
1,forget about it,sorry but this product (needed for educ. tapes) could not accept a cassette. Returned to Sony service and told couldn't be repaired. Since it's not a popular item replacement not available. They promised to send us a check but since we've made other plans don't need a replacement.
4,...does the job..mainly for voice.,For $10 ..what a deal.I write songs and play guitar and it's handy to record the music (at the moment).Sound quality as expected is mediochre.I did record a financial message from my speaker phone (Panasonic) handset. Very good. This alone justifies this recorder. I will have to record from this to a digital hand recorder to check out the quality.Digital is not everything...but almost. lol
1,"Worse; then, useless","This may be the worst-written and most poorly edited book I've ever seen. Full of maybe-even-interesting but absolutely useless, (not to mention repetitive) facts, factoids, and opinions having next to nothing to do with actually learning something about celestial navigation (example: ""Dick Gordon, astronaut, has pointed out, that most photos of the moon are placed upside down"".) Rife with typos, spelling errors, and punctuation errors that a second-grader wouldn't make, this ""book"" shouldn't even be in print, much less for sale. Nonetheless, if there were one thing I would suggest to make the book at least marginally worthwhile, it would be for the author to ask himself, ""So what?"" about every fact/factoid/opinion he chooses to include. 99% of this book left me wondering, ""So what?"""
4,Quality there still.,"The quality is till there, but I will agree that the palm control ratches from SK can ""feel"" a little sloppy. You can tighten them up with an hex wrench and they will preform very well. What you are feeling is the washer on top for you palm has a little slop in it so that it will spin freely. With a little mechanical knowledge you will understand why. I would recomend for hard use, to change the ratchet handle to one of their Tuff 1 rachet handles."
1,Very Disappointed,"One glance through this book and it is immediately obvious that this is ""Villa Wannabe""--American Style. If you think you are really in a foreign country when you visit Epcot, then you might think this book represents French or Italian Villas, but it does not. It shows homes of American clients that are chock full of 'so called' decorative accessories and fru-fru treatments sold to them by eager Interior Decorators. Save your money and put it towards ""Venetian Palazzi"", This reasonably priced large format bookhas wonderful photographs that showgreat details of interior and drawings of the exteriors.The text is in 4 languages. I love ""Venetian Palazzi"". ORVenetian Palacesby Alvise Zorzi, Paolo Marton---a much better investment."
2,Not Really What I Expected,"The decor in this book is grandiose and busy. Unless you own a grandiose house and don't actually live in it, you may find little in this book to apply to your situation. If you live in a typical house and want a Tuscan flair, you would do well to look elsewhere."
5,great product.,I just got this product from Amazon and its great. Fits perfectly for the big armchair I have at work. I'm getting another one for home!
4,back pain,An excellent tool to promote better posture while easing back pain. I would recommend it highly.
2,Difficult to use,This lumbar support is too large for use in our vehicle. The strap is elastic and doesn't hold it in place. The foam shifts around in the cover. I feel there are much better supports out there. I lent it to a friend who drives many hours each day - he tried it in 2 different vehicles and had the same opinion. I don't recommend the purchase of this support.
2,Not enough info,This lumbar roll is way too firm for me. The description did not seem adequate; it should have stated how deep and how hard; no dimensions were given.I paid extra for overnight shipping and received the item two weeks later.
1,dont buy,"i knew i was giving it a shot and wasted money cause it suuuuuucks. cool idea though, just leave it alone."
4,Very good book,"After reading this book, I decided scale trading wasn't for me. To properly scale trade, you need a large amount of capital and the intestinal fortitude to watch your account go through significant drawdowns. But despite my misgivings about the scale trading method itself, this is still one of my favorite books. The author has worked as a broker and as a fund manager, among other things. His opinions and stories about what happens in the markets are classic. His dry wit and ""tell it like it is"" style of storytelling make it hard to put the book down in certain places. This is a valuable addition to any trader's library. If you can find a copy, it's well worth the time and trouble."
4,More a Journal than a History,"This delightful book by James Fitz James Caldwell is a must read for those interested in the War Between the States. The fact that Caldwell began and mostly completed this book while the War was still raging makes it unique. The presence of my own Great Grandfather during much of the naritive initially drew me to this book. However, I quickly realized that a personal contact was not necessary to enjoy this journal-like account of men and events. Of great interest is Caldwell's reliance on information that was generally held at the time regarding troop movements, troop strength and War news (mostly rumors). Footnotes from official War records overlay Caldwell's perceptions with actual numbers. Each of the Brigade's engagements is described including a tally of the killed and wounded from each of the five regiments. If you enjoy details, this book is for you."
2,I agree with Howard!!,"I too bought the CRSR-10 thru SIRIUS. Product works OK but.....the car kit is missing the ""button holder"" to mount the unit in the vehicle. I called SANY and they said call SIRIUS!!SIRIUS customer service (what a laugh!!) is a complete joke!! I called the toll free number and after being hung up on 3 times I finally get some guy named ""kevin"" who instructed me to box everything up and send it back and they would send me a new unit. All I wanted was the missing part!! Good Luck with anyone trying to deal with SIRIUS customer service!"
3,ANYONE CAN SEE that she got robbed from being a star ~ !,"Sure this CD has typical 1980s production levels that sound dated yet Ms CARA still manages to demonstrate the above quality performance of a talented vocalist.Even after having been awarded the GRAMMY AWARD for BEST POP VOCALIST, it's strange that IRENE never acheived the same degree of music stardom as SHEENA EASTON, LAURA BRANIGAN or even KIM CARNES did during that same moment in time.However, if you love pure ""right on target"" POP/R&B female vocals then this is truly the product for you !Sample something more than her traditional hit CDs: FLASHDANCE & FAME ~ !"
2,never kink,It probably will never kink if you don't unroll it/seems too light and already has the tell tale kink look
4,GREAT FOR SMALL DOGS,"GREAT FOR SMALL DOGS, HOWEVER, MY 24 LB. COCKER SPANIEL WAS TOO BIG. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR DOGS UNDER 20 LBS. FITS WELL UNDER SEATS, IT FIT COMFORTABLY UNDER A SEAT IN AN EMBRAER 175 JET (DELTA SHUTTLE USES THEM FOR LGA-ORD)."
5,Best carrier!,"Worked wonderful! Bought to fly on Jet Blue for an older over weight bichon and she was very content! Thought we might have a problem with the size, but once they realized it was crushable, we went thru just fine. No problems with it fitting under the seat, either! Glad we bought it!"
5,The best ever grapefruit spoons!,"These spoons are awesome. We ordered for ourselves, but everyone in the family loved them so much that we have ordered them 3 more times as gifts. They make enjoying grapefruit as a regular meal item so much easier to deal with."
5,Love them,"They were exactly what I was looking for. The quality of the spoons is high, their appearance is simple yet attractive. I'm very pleased with them. They were delivered promptly."
3,Good phone for those who won't use it alot.,"Don't be fooled by the kids review -- I have to write a review and I'm certainly not creating an account to do so.This phone is great for those who won't use it alot, because after about 3 minutes the phone heats up to the point where it is unbearable to hold up to your ear. I can't say I recommend it.... the keys are too close together in an effort to make the phone appear smaller, but it's just too clumsy for bigger hands...even my small hands had problems texting on it. The calls are terrible and and sound clippy. Not to mention it takes 78 seconds to turn on. (Yes, my sister counted). Both me and my sister who also has this phone are moving on to better things; not to mention a better service. Sa la ve Sprint and A740, hello T-mobile & SIDEKICK 3! ;D"
5,1982toyota pickup,We need this to help our grandson work on his pickup. We found it ti be very informative and would recommend.it.
1,"Broken, Low quality, no customer support","I recieved this item in December 0f 2008. Within a year it was malfunctioning. Right cd player skips, shuts down, and dies without warning. This makes it completely unusable for live performance. According to the manual it is within warranty, but MARATHON equipment has not responded to my multiple e-mails, and they do not provide a phone number or address for support. Seems very shady to me.I was attracted to this player for the sleek look and low price, but I won't be buying a MARATHON machine again."
4,Mpress got a few catchy songs,"I love for You, great love ballardSuddenly another great love ballardThe other songs are great to relax to. I have to admit, theydon't stand out. If you want album you didn't feel like youwaste, then buy the cd. There is bound to be a few songs anyonewill like."
4,Great,"Even if the expected delivery was long the book arrived in 2 weeks, the product was new and absolutely cheap! :)The book is great, well structured and student-friendly!"
1,CD from Stone Mulitmedia,"I don't know how good this CD is because I NEVER GOT IT!!!!I sent an Email to Stone Mulitmedia AND Amazon and did not receive any response except to fill out this review.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM STONE MULITMEDIA!! Reading some of their past reviews, I see that this is not sn isolated case!Also, AMAZON..where is the help???"
4,"JOSEPH'S NEW ALBUM IS GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT.","I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO JOSEPH'S NEW ALBUM, BUT IT WAS NOT FANTASTIC LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. DON'T GET ME WRONG I LIKE IT, BUT IT IS REALLY DANCE ORIENTATED. THERE ARE A FEW SLOW SONGS BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT IS DANCE AND POP.I THINK THAT THE BEST SONGS ARE, I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU (WHICH HAS AN ALTERNATIVE FEEL), STAY THE SAME, AND ONE NIGHT. IN THE FUTURE I HOPE HE HAS MORE BALLADS BECAUSE HE SINGS THOSE KINDS OF SONGS THE BEST. NEVERTHELESS, I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY HIS ALBUMS BECAUSE HIS WORK IS SINCERE."
4,it's good,"it's a good album, it has songs that you immediatly fall for like ""I can't do without you"" and it makes you very happy. it's not a brilliant album, but give the guy a break since it would be a shame if this was his best album ever. I believe his best album is yet to come and he'll only get better so we have a lot to look forward to from mr. McIntyre."
3,i think the COVER is the only thing it's got going.,i think my comment about the cover says it best!!! two good songs...maybe three....a disappointment to all that are musically inclined!!!!!
2,Disappointing,"From an NKOTB fan, this CD was a little disappointing. I guess it was a good start for him, since this was his first try at writing lyrics. But, most of the songs didn't say anything, didn't flow and the vocals were a bit on the ""trying to prove something"" side! It just seemed insincere and fake."
5,IT'S AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"it is a very heartwarming album by one of our greatest young stars. :Joey"" had out grown his boyish charm and developed himself into a mature and out spoken writer and artist. I have always been a new kids fan, but he has definitley proved that he has a voice all his own. I bet many people don't know this but he wasnt an ""original"" member of NKOTB he took the place of someone named ""Jamie"" whose mother denied him to be in ""new kids"" I bet she is kicking herself in the ass now!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have tickets to one of Joey's upcoming shows and it will definitely be a blast, I GIVE THIS ALBUM 2 THUMBS UP, and I look forward to other albums to come."
5,Shipped fast,"Saved money vs buying at the ""SHACK"" and received within a few days of ordering. Always check with Amazon on items such as HDMI cables , cell batteries, etc before going to a box store."
5,xm antenna,"This is an excellent product, same quality as the ones that come new with the radio. I am very pleased with this."
5,Works great !!,"Simply put,,, It works fine ! I use it in my car so I can keep the other one in my RV. All I need to do is switch the radio. Everything else stays in the vehicle that its installed in."
3,Beware static discharge,"We've had 2 of these units. I'm not sure why the first died (gift to my mother-in-law) but the second died on a cold, dry winter day when a static charge zapped from my finger to the touch device. Killed it dead. Worked great until then."
3,Surprisingly unreliable,"I bought this boombox just one year ago. I was please with its performance, but the cassette deck completely broke down. I called the Sony helpline for advice as to how to get it repaired, but they were of no help. I was disappointed that this boombox had broken down so quickly."
5,A return to life through art!,"Every track of this disc will enhance your mind. Too many confused artists try to market their confusion about what life is. Life is not complicated, Man complicates life. Throughout this disc, it is apparent that Black Star understands the simplicity of life. ""Thieves in the night,"" ""K.O.S. (Determination)"" and ""Respiration"" let you KNOW that these men have an understanding of life, and though this effort they attempt to dispel the unnecessary complications that people put upon life and living. Also, the Black Star production team definitely has their ears to the rails! Pulling from jazz, reggae, early hiphop and more, along with outstanding lyrics and themes, Black Star is dripping with artistic competence. If Black Star is the future of hiphop...let hiphop rise. On another note, don't tape it from your friends...BUY IT NOW!!!"
3,OVERRATED,THIS IS A DECENT ALBUM..I NEVER PLAYED IT TOO MUCH AND IF IT IS CLASSIC I WOULDA KNOWN IT..BEEN LISTENIN TO ONLY REAL HIP HOP SINCE 87..EVERYWHERE I LOOK ON HERE I SEE PEOPLE SAYING ITS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME..LIKE TOP 5..THATS A JOKE..ITS TWO DECENT MC'S OVER DECENT BEATS WITH DECENT MATERIAL..ITS BETTER THAN MOST STUFF THAT COMES OUT OR CAME OUT AT THAT TIME I THINK THATS WHY IT GETS SUCH HIGH REVIEWS..BUT IF YOU WERE TO PUT THIS ALBUM UP AGAINST ANY REAL CLASSICS ITS A JOKE..ITS NOT EVEN A TOP 50 HIP HOP ALBUM OF ALL TIME..ITS DECENT THATS IT
2,A NEED 2 STAY SOLO,I believe Mos Def should drop that zero and stay my hero. He is totally fine by himself and I don't understand the need to be with talib.
2,Boring and Uninspired,"I wanted to like this cd because I love the Winans family and I think its great for guys to show their sensitive side when it comes to relationships (which Mario does), but I find this cd to be BORING!! I am really surprise because he sounds so uninspired vocally and yet write passionate lyrics. He reminds me of Timbaland...someone who is a great producer, but a lame artist. Such a shame...some people can't have it all."
1,Agreed!!!! WACK IT IS!!!!,"This was definitely a waste of money. I was very disappointed with the content of the album. All the tracks sound the same. I keep trying to give the album a chance, but I keep pulling it out the disc changer."
4,Pretty good for his first project,"I give this cd actually a 3 1/2. I think Mario did a really good job on his freshman cd. However, there's room for growth vocally and I feel in time he will get there. However, he definitely has style with his music and didn't just put out something that's similar to everything that's being played on the radio.It is worth purchasing and I believe he will do even better on his sophomore cd."
4,not too bad..,"This C.D isn't as bad as ya'll are making it out to be. Ok so some of the interludes don't mix well with the point he's trying to put across, but c'mon you gotta give the guy a break, not every man can make 14 or 15 tracks admitting to how he got played and hurt by a women. ""Never Really Was"" and ""Turn Around"" are two of the hottest songs on the whole C.D. Ever sence hearing ""I Don't Wanna Know"" I feel in love with his man's voice.. So he might be a little monotone, But if you listen hard enough you can feel his pain, the whole C.D moves me. I woulnd't say it's the best tracks he's ever produced, but it's sure as hell good!!!-- BlOnDiE"
4,Nicely made for the money,"Bought these for my husband for Tai Chi. He is a 9-1/2 and ordered a 43. They fit fine except he has flat feet and normally wears a wide shoe. These shoes are narrow for him. They have no insert,, so they do not have any support. He says they will be fine and certainly worth the money."
5,Better Than the Cubase Handbook !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is twice what the handbook is, especially if you only have the pdf version. Since the pdf version is the only version you get when you buy Cubase and if you want the hardcopy version you have to buy it, save yourself some time and money. Buy this book instead of the Cubase manual. This book is easily laid out and enjoyable to read. The illustrations are right on the mark and compliment the text excellently. My knowledge of Cubase doubled after reading this book, and it helped take my recording to the next level. As I pick out recordings and listen to them, it is easy to tell which one were recorded before reading this book and which one were recorded after. I recommend this book for anyone serious about recording using the Steinberg Cubase software."
4,"Live is better, but this is good!","I first saw Regan @ Brown's Island in Richmond. She reached out and snatched my shirtfront, and demanded I listen. Glad I did.I've seen bar bands, superstars, critics' darlings, rockers, punks, cowboys, thugs, jazz players and bluesmen.Regan can run with the big dogs. Great stage presence, great connections with the audience, and she so loves what she's doing- it's hard to say who having the most fun.This CD has several great songs, and no ""mas a menos"" ones and that voice! So clearly hers!- I've been known to leave it in the CD player for days (luckily, my friends are willing to overlook certain quirks).Of course, no CD can capture the experience of Regan live, but this is a great intro to her work, and a nifty fix between live shows!"
1,Mediocre,I bought this album on a whim because we have the same very unusual first name and I knocked it on the floor in the record store and thought it was some sort of sign. BIG mistake. The lyrics are old and nothing you haven't heard before in a more mentally provocative way and the music is boring and over polished. Her voice is unmemorable and uninteresting. I really would rather have given her the money I spent on the album to stop singing. She's never going to make it big with this kind of album because there's nothing special about it. I suggest you keep on going.
4,great story and good reading but.......,"didn't anyone find the ending a little wierd?don't want to give it away but those who read it, don't you feel it was a little crazy?"
1,Sorry but I trust my old pressure cooker,"I have own Presto Pressure Cooker for years, as well as my mother in Havana, Cuba, and are the best pressure cookers you can buy. You have all the replacements of parts from Presto and also from Amazon at your disposal. They are excellent and 1/4 of the price of these Fagor pressure cooker. Amazon have the Presto steel pressure cookers from Presto as well as the regular aluminum models. They all work great for all your recipes and comes with great cook book. Don't look for anything else! Amazon have all the Presto Cookers available. Amazon pricing is the best on these pressure cookers."
1,Worst shooter ever,"Seriously, guys. ... I purchased this game immediatly without looking at reviews or stuff (which I usually do. It works out well 75% of the time), knowing the fact that I loved the film. This game was a big dissapointment. It is not playable at all. The framerate is horrible compared to old and new games. The graphics are the opposite of impressive... this game is just packed with flaws. This game is a mess. Do not buy this game, no matter what. If you want a PlayStation shooter, grab a copy of one of these: Medal of Honor (and its sequels), Metal Gear Solid, Syphon Filter (and its sequels), Tomb Raider (and its sequels), and/or Resident Evil (and its sequels)."
3,o.k,I found that the graphics on this werent top of the line.The guns are not as good as sython filters which is awesome.The gadgets are cool.The only thing that I would say is awesome about this game is how you can hear voices instead of dialog.The levels are pretty easy.This game is not the exact thing as the movie also.I would recommend this to anyone that likes games were you sneak around and plant bombs.I think this would be good for people who just got playstation and want a action game.
1,Enjoyment Impossible,"Just like the movie, this game has no plot, and it blows. The weapons are average, the animation is average, and the game in general is sub-par."
2,Obviously an item that had been returned.,"The card was supposed to include a cable, but did not. It was clearly an item that had been returned and sent out again. The documentation that came with the card, and that available on line, is poor.Despite that, I would recommend the card because it has the TI IEEE 1394 chipset, which seems to be the best one. But I would not recommend the seller because this was used merchandise passed off as new."
1,What a joke!,"ELO without Jeff Lynne is not ELO ""part anything""!If these guys needed some cash, they should have called themsleves anything else... but leave the ""E.L.O."" name alone.Jeff Lynne could have taken legal action, but the fact that he didn't proves how useless this rip-off band realy was. Jeff Lynnne's band - the real ELO - and his music will live on forever. This bunch will fade if they haven't already.If you want to buy this rubbish - and feed the machine that says music is all about the $$$ and not about the soul that went into it in the first place - then, go right ahead. But, there is the real ELO - and plenty of it. So why bother???"
3,ELO Without Lynne?,"ELO Part II, although often being thought of as a second rate rip-off of the Original ELO is a fairly competant band. The new vocalists really go all out to re-capture that sound and presence of Jeff Lynne, and do so quite well, however, apart from ""A Thousand Eyes"", possibly the best song on this album (and reminicent ""Twilight"") the rest are average to poor. One should rather look into their second album ""Moment of Truth"" for a better refelection of the band's capabilities."
3,"Despite horrible enemy AI,a pretty cool game.","The original was okay due to okay graphics and amazing fun factor. The sequal is worse in some ways but better in most. Graphics: The graphics are much better than the first , now there are FMVs and more good looking enimes.AI enemy AI is terrible . They walk so slowly and have bad aim. Sound: the sound is pretty good , Hawk sounds like a mercanary bad-@$$ (sorry I had to say that) Fun: The game is pretty fun but not as fun as the first one . Overal: 7.0"
1,I wish I could give this item 'No Stars',"I purchased one of these back in April of 2004, its now the beginning of October and this unit failed twice. First time the batteries exploded, causing a stain in my wall outlet. I sent it back to Coleman who replaced it and sent me $5.00 to replace the outlet cover. This was in June. The replacement has now failed, it does not charge and the flashlight does not work. The glowing locator pad is the only remaining part that works. I took this one apart and found a resistor that was baked. The whole thing is in the trash now. Save your money, buy something better."
1,Only 6 minutes of dinosaurs!,"I didn't like this video at all and neither did my son who LOVES dinosaurs. First, it's mainly about fossils and only has about 6 minutes of dinosaurs in the 20 minute video. The DVD states that it's 55 minutes long but the dinosaur section is 20 and then the rest is about horses. If it's titled ""All about Dinosaurs"" then why is more than 1/2 of it about horses. I'm very disappointed!"
1,the DVD did not work at all it had a crack on it I will not buy anything from this seller again,the DVD did not work at all it had a crack on it I will not buy anything from this seller again
2,"Doesn't kink, but gets a hole","At first I was pleased with this hose, it has a rather small diameter but was working well. I was using it in a limited capacity around the yard and simply by dragging it across the ground a hole wore through in less than 1 month. This hose is clearly not designed for use around the yard. I would stick to its actual application as a boat or camper hose that gets limited use and be sure not to drag it around."
1,Misleading!,"A terrible CD! Misleading, because it said nothing that the songs were re-sung by the artists, with there much older, and weaker voices! Many of which can no longer sing very well at all! Don't buy!!"
1,Release of the Stranglehold,"What really has Sunstein freaked is that liberal elites are losing their stranglehold on political discourse. The gates the gatekeepers have been guarding for fifty or more years have been outflanked. The American people are finding, much to their amazement and delight, that a wide range of sensible approaches to problem-solving that never even get mentioned on the nightly news are thoughtfully and exhaustively dealt with on the Internet by everyday people who possess rhetorical and journalistic skills easily the equal of 95% of the professional journalists out there.The Internet is a boon to true democracy, but a bane to the ""expert, credentialist"" culture. It should be amusing to watch these erstwhile champions of free speech (as long as it's their speech that is free) attempt to justify legislative measures designed to put-down the rabble. Sunstein's book is an opening skirmish. I expect much more sophistry to come."
4,Calming,"I bought this to help with razor burn following BBS shaving. I have some difficult areas and to get the close shave I want, I get some razor burn. This stuff helps quite a bit. It burns less than other aftershaves upon initial application and quickly soothes the problem areas. The scent is not my favorite, but that's not the most important aspect to me and it is acceptable. I will try other products, but I'll be buying this stuff again."
5,Real Man S***,I doesn't stink up a room hours after you leave but it is remembered..... I think that's better thank making people choke...
1,Exploding Cookware!,"Oh man. I had this set, and after less than a year of very light use, it shattered in the oven while I was baking an apple crisp. Gooey apples and topping everywhere. The oven was only at 350 or so, and it was on the middle rack. There is just no excuse for something like that happening. I thought Corning was good brand, being the maker of Pyrex -- what gives?"
2,Disappointingly fragile (or poorly constructed),"I've had nothing but bad luck with this item. Had to return the first purchase because -- right out of the box -- blue bands appeared on the recorded video. The second unit I had was OK for three months, but then it also exhibited the ""blue bands"" effect. One day within the 90 day warrantee period (whew!), took it in to get it fixed -- heads were out of alignment. Now, after six months of owning the camera, a pin in the Firewire connector pushed out through the back, and now it won't connect up to my computer. Sigh. Repair or dump?"
3,Awesome comfort but fade VERY fast!,These are so comfy its sad that they have faded so fast :(I recommend them if you wash in delicates or don't wear them a lotThey would be perfect if the color stayed BLACK longer
5,Must have,The book is a must have for a foundational basis for those going into the photography business. This book is on my top ten list as well as their book as their book on marketing and selling wedding photography.
3,Expected more,"Songs selection not up to my expectations. Original songs are great. Looks as if the group does not have enough original songs and therefore, ""adopted"" other groups' songs."
3,Hardware quality lacking,"The umbrella looks great, but the hardware for lowering or raising lack the ability to be useful over a long period. The fabric is great quality for the Arizona sun so I rate that part as excellent."
3,Won't burn but hard-to-handle,"I was looking for flame-proof potholders for my 90-year-old mother. These won't burn, but they lack enough flexibility for her to use them as potholders. They are fine as trivets, but her arthritic hands cannot handle pans with these."
3,Not as heat resistant as I would like,"I got these to use as hot pads on the counter. I thought that the silicone would really block the heat when setting pans from the oven on them. I have been using 2 pads (doubled up) at a time under my pans. They still have a lot of heat under them that is getting onto the counter. I have not had any problems with burning to the counter, but I wish these were a little more heat resistant."
1,Burned my Finger,I don't like these Pot Holders at all. They are too stiff to work comfortable with. I feel like the item is going to fall before I get it on the counter. I have gone back to my big hand cloth pot holders.
1,Inflexible,"The MIU silicone pot holders are too inflexible to be of practical use. They isolate heat well, but are too stiff to hold a pot handle easily."
3,something different,"It does have the qualities I was looking for... no more burning holes in the pot holder and then burning my fingers because I forgot there was a hole in the cloth pot holder. It is hard to get used to the feel of them, but I am not burning my fingers."
5,The MacGyver of Pot Holders,What!?!!!?Hot pans? No problem!Need a trivet? No problem!Can't get that lid off? No problem!Lost one? No problem! You get two for the price of one!
4,very handy,I like that these are easily washable and resist heat well. Sometimes though the way they bend lands them in my food more than with cloth hot pads. Overall though I really like these better.
5,As Good As It Gets,"I was too young to appreciate these stories when they appeared in the Detective Comics I bought (for the Batman appearances) as a young kid. But I remembered them because of the artwork, and was really glad to have found this collection recently. While many of the elements that were fresh in 1974 are conventional today, this is still an example of fully dedicated comic book craftsmanship at its very best. Those who loved the clean, detailed, draftsman's approach to finished comic art that Terry Austin once brought to the pencils of John Byrne and Marshall Rogers will find similar satisfaction in Simonson's work here. A really great collection that shouldn't be missed."
2,A HORRIBLE CD!!!!!,"i would give the cd 1 star, but i like What's SO Different...Other than that the lyrics, his voice, style of content is horrible....i had the impression that this cd would be the best one of the best in 1999...but it isn't..i took the cd back the next day and exhanged it from something worth listening to some Marvin Gaye....i think this cd was extremely overrated...."
5,"The sexy smooth star is back and he is bad, straight up","Yo, the brother did it again. His sweet, smooth vocals and sexy style has made every woman wish they were in his arms. Fo real!! His jams ""So Anxious"", ""Whats So Different"", and ""Final Warning"" (which features the all so good and talented ""AALIYAH"") are hitting. Yo go out and by this. Diamond"
5,THIS CD IS SO TIGHT IT IS PHAT A REAL WINNER,I THINK THAT THIS CD IS TRUE AND THE LYRICS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT A COUPLE HAS TO GO THREW EVERYDAY. EVERY SONG IS ON HIT PERSONALLY I THINK THAT HE SHOULD HAVE MADE A DOUBLE CD I THINK THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD.
2,Probably not the whole movie,"I ordered the VHS previously, and I had forgotten one thing: this is a really LONG movie. It easily rates 2 VHS tapes, and I learned.It's the story of the Australian singer Johnny O'Keefe, and It's a great movie. If you can get the whole thing."
1,NOT the Original Recordings,"That's pretty much all you need to know. If you can see the album cover, it notes that some of these are NOT the original recordings. These are recordings by ""one or more members of the original group."" Pick a different hits collection if you're feeling nostalgic. ""You Got It All"" is definitely NOT the same as the recording I remember from my roller skating days at the age of eleven."
1,Disappointing,not sure why they even made this version of their hits but I feel totally duped. I purchased on iTunes at a discounted price so the phrase 'you get what you pay for' could not apply more to this 'greatest hits' compilation. Dont waste your $$. put a couple of more bucks with it and get the correct version. I ended up having to repurchase.
1,Bad TV,This TV is a joke. The specs provided by RCA are not correct for this TV. The dimensions are not remotely correct. The picture is terrible. It failed after 2 months and the factory does not respond to the warrenty. Their technical assistance department is almost non exisant but consists of housewives working out of their homes that don't know an RCA jack from a coaxial connector. Go for this TV at your own risk because when it fails you are totally on your own.
4,Great flat iron for long hair,This is the widest flat iron I have ever purchased and it works great on my long hair. The shine that it gives me makes me glad my old flat iron broke. I can feel the difference between the two when I flat iron my hair - this one has a more professional feel and professional results. Great price! Hope it lasts as long as my old iron.
2,never again,"I used an earlier edition to buy my Mercury Cougar a few years ago. While the book clearly showed that earlier models were unreliable, the ratings for the newer models were pretty good. I thought that meant the car had been improved in recent years. Turns out, all that meant was the newer models weren't old enough yet to start suffering from the same problems all the previous models had. Apparently, the reliability ratings don't take that into account. The book is fine, so long as you recognize that limitation and completely discount good reliability ratings for newer models. Instead, look at the ratings for the older models."
2,"Is outdated price whise, not enought details,","is not a bad guide for used car research but just don;t see why it worth 10 bucks, price can;t follow try online usually is more accurate, blue book or edmunds, not details of each car either very basic guide not worth the money."
4,RAY PRICE GOSPEL,THE LIST OF SONGS IS GOOD - THE SOUND IS OK - JUST NOT MY FAVORITE SINGER - MAYBE IT WILL GROW ON ME!
1,TERRIBLE!,"This faucet looks great. That's the end of the good news.We've owned it 6 years and it leaks all the time. Kohler sent free replacement parts, but the handle screw is frozen in place and I can't get the faucet apart. It doesn't help that the handle screw is the in BACK of the faucet, meaning no clearance to work with (unless you remove the whole faucet assembly from the sink). Life shouldn't be this difficult.Overall, poor design and poor quality. Excellent customer support doesn't really make up for this terrible product.Read the other reviews on Amazon and then go with another brand! That's what I'm doing."
1,Good looker but a leaker and design flaws,"Installed this faucet in October of 2012. Since then the o-rings have already failed. My wife loves to use a swivel type sprayer that threads into the faucet. You know the type. They can be purchased at Lowes, Home Depot, Ace, Menards. Just unscrew the existing aerator and screw a swivel type spray aerator in its place. Just one thing... the back pressure just from a new aerator causes the faucet to leak a lot of water at the base of the faucet. A Kohler representative informed me this problem can be expected and only the aerator that comes with this faucet is advised to be used. To be fair, Kohler stands behind their products. Great parts replacement policy in their warranty. Problem isn't the warranty, it's the design of the product. I would advise anyone to steer clear of of this faucet and look at another manufacture with a better engineered product. Hope this helps someone."
1,Not my cup of tea...,"I was looking for a brisk cup of coffee; I got a tepid, terribly sweet cup of weak tea."
2,A Let Down,"Following up ""Fall of the Plastic Empire"" would no doubt be a hard task for the Burning Brides, and rather than rise to the occasion they seem to have thrown in their towel. Rather than continue to explore their crative, interesting sound, they seem to have settled to become a watered down radio rock band. Each song on this album is forgettable and seems like a Darkness track with worse vocals. Leave ""Leave No Ashes"" on the store shelf and go see an AC/DC coverband instead."
3,Product OK but...,"These are tiny spoons meant to stir tea - only about 4.75 inches long. Quality is OK. But if the product description were better, we would have known they would not meet our needs."
4,"Very Fun, But Not At Its Full Potential","This is an awesome racing game, but with sorry graphics. The cars are very cool, but again the graphics pretty much stink in this game. THe handling is very hard, until you upgrade your car, which makes the game kinda bad too. I would reccomend Tokyo Extreme Racing or Crazy Taxi over this one."
4,"Alot of Fun, but could be better","This was one of the first games I bought for my DC, so I was very impressed with it at first. But after seeing the graphics available in other games, I've become disenchanted with it. It doesn't support more than 2 racers at a time, and doesn't have any 'tremor' support. The steering is was too tight, and I found it doesn't translate well to a racing wheel.On the other hand, I found it more entertaining than the other 'race track' games available, racing in the streets beat outrunning cops beats 'doing laps' as far as I'm concerned."
5,ChurchNext: Quantum Changes in How We Do Ministry,"Perceiving that a generation of under-thirty-five-year-olds is turning away from institutional expressions of Christianity to opting to define their own spiritual journey, Dr. Eddie Gibbs, a seasoned scholar of church growth, suggests a nine key area in which churches need to undergo transforming transitions in our days of cultural shifts. This book is highly recommend for pastor and church leaders who are ministering to people groups or individuals with a variety of traditional, modern, or postmodern worldviews in our pluralist society. The nine key areas for which the author provides both insightful theory and practical application include, ""From Market Driven to Mission Oriented,"" ""From Attracting the Crowd to Seeking the Lost,"" and ""From Belonging to Believing."""
2,Do Not Substitute This Unit For a VCR!!,"My emotions are mixed on this unit. The DVD portion of the machine works beautifully, but I didn't buy this unit for the DVD player.....I bought it for its ability to replace my VCR, hoping that I'd no longer have to buy VHS tapes in order to record TV shows. This unit is supposed to record up to 40 hours of programming on its hard drive, which would make it ideal for anyone going on a long vacation. But the only way I can get it to record is by turning on the unit, setting it to a channel, and hitting the record button. This means that you have to MANUALLY turn the record function on.....as well as turning it OFF!! The RCA folks were of no help, in that they read from the same manual that I do....the one that comes with the unit.So, be very careful if you're looking to this unit as a replacement for your old VCR! It simply won't do what it's supposed to do!"
1,Beware Of Third Party Expansion Packs,I have used many expansion packs and they all have failed miserably. They can cause issues from crashing to loading problems. The only expansion pack that works without issues is the Nintendo brand expansion pack.
3,Complete Android Saga? Don't think so,"I enjoyed the set. But felt cheated at the end when there was no conclusion to the Android Saga. They were still on their way to find Goku. The clifhanger ending was suspensful, but it doesn't count as making the saga complete. There should've been 8 discs if needed to make this a complete box set.Also, the Garlic Jr. saga was far better when i didn't have to wait weeks for it to end. Although, i wanted smack Gohan toward the end of it, it really isn't a bad stretch."
1,i have not received it yet!,"Hello,I am leaving this review , because I have never received this book~I hope someone will see this and send it asap.thank you!"
5,Excellent Advice on Selling!,"Ziglar has written perhaps one of the best books ever on sales. A prolific author, this title focuses more on practical ways to becoming a more successful salesperson.Among the points covered include:1. Ethical selling.2. Overcoming call reluctance.3. Tips on prospecting.4. Asking good questions helps the buying process.5. Selling to different personality types.6. Principles of closing the sale.7. People skills and facets of business travel.8. Organization and discipline.Since I work in sales, I can testify that the book has helped me in the selling process. What I particularly liked was the encouragement to continue a high level of integrity, service, and acting in the customer's interest.Read, enjoy, and be encouraged to be a better salesperson!"
4,High end wedding ideas,"This is a beautiful book that outlines and shows photographs of recent high society weddings. The sites are extremely elegant and exclusive. The book showcases what can be done by creative wedding planners who probably have no budget! Gorgeous flowers, cakes, dresses, jewelry, hairstyles, etc. for the bride and groom who want to make a major statement. This book covers it all from wedding invitations to flower girls. If you want to have an extraordinary day and money isn't an object, this book has some wonderful ideas and resources."
2,Mostly worthless,"This book does not cover topics well enough to pass the exam. It might be useful as an addition to other materials or as a review for experienced DBAs, but it does NOT have the information you need to pass by itself.After failing the OCA exam (after acing the books' 2 exams, thanks guys!) I smashed this book against a brick wall until it was nothing but torn pages fluttering in the breeze. The binding held up well through the first several smashings, and stomping the separated pieces produced an enjoyable tearing sound."
2,Nauvoo as Mormon Mythmaking,"First published in 1900, this book on the Mormons in Nauvoo, Illinois, between 1839 and 1846 is overtly mythic. It too often reduces the actual complexity of events, avoids matters that challenge or contradict Mormon myth, views the Mormons as good and their opponents as evil, and all too often ignores the cultural context of the early church. It deals with the Mormon experience in a defensive manner while fostering the myth of Mormon innocence and religious persecution. Roberts emphasizes the persecution of the Mormons for religious reasons, but fails to explore systematically the causes of conflict that led to the assassinations of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, and his brother, Hyrum Smith, in Carthage, Illinois, in 1844."
2,Worked well until it started smoking.,"I don't typically review items on Amazon, nor am I a jaded customer looking to hurt the company by bad mouthing their product that failed on me. However, the point remains that the product did fail.I've owned this product for approximately 1-2 years. It has worked flawlessly for that time period although it didn't exactly have a large workload.About a week ago I went to make a protein shake, simply mixing powder with milk. The blender slowed to a crawl and failed mix the solution at all. I lifted it out of the milk to see what was wrong only to be hit with an awful smell. Something within the handheld piece was smoking. Smelled as though maybe the motor or possibly a bushing of some sort, I didn't open to see.I've given it two stars. The product works great while it works. It's rather quiet too compared to others I've heard. Perhaps I simply had a bad one, but replacing every 1-2 years leads me to believe I should just find another one."
1,the worst product rom Cuisinart,"I have now had 3 smart stick shaft's and all have had the cog's in the shaft shear off. It pops out of the chopper top and then quickly shears the pins off the inside rending it useless with all attachments. Customer service is rude but does replace the shaft, you pay for postage and ties up the smart stick for at least 10 days. They need to fix this problem, not just replace it with a rebuilt model with the same problem. DON'T bother with this product."
1,Worthless,"This looked like the best available hand blender when I purchased it a year or two ago. Despite rather light use, it stopped working. It features cheap, plastic parts which cannot be repaired or replaced Look elsewhere."
5,Wow. How easy,"As in most things in life, I thought this would be harder than it was. It was given to me as a gift last yr and I hadn't used it. Finally tried it today for soup and I can't believe how easy it was. Only used the immersion part but all I can say is wow. Makes life so much easier than transferring to a blender (and I have a blendtec). Clean up was a snap! I didn't make a mess, which was my main concern. For $50 this is a no brainer kitchen gadget."
2,Fell Apart After Two Years,"This was the first immersion blender we had purchased at the time. It worked well, and the attachments were handy. However, after about a year the case started to come apart and the mechanism that holds the attachments to the motor started to get loose. I would not recommend this if you are going to use it more than once a week."
4,"great tool, but be sure to use safety precautions!","I love the ease of this tool, but it may be a little too easy. For those of us that are accident prone...be careful. I was cleaning cookie dough from the blade and grabbed the stick. The blades were set in motion and made hamburger meat of my index finger. Granted--my stupidity, but just pay close attention when using this kitchen tool. That being said, I have found the Cuisinart smart stick to be incredibly useful and convenient. Perfect for small blending and chopping tasks."
1,Piece of crap!,I bought this against my better judgment only because I knew I would upgrade to one of those fantastic braun multiquicks with their fabulous array of attachments that my sister waxes lyrical about (she has one in the UK). The really top ones from that range don't seem to be available in the US so I thought this would do for my remaining few years here. But think again - the chopper hasn't worked once!
2,Not long lasting,I have had this blender for a few years and only used it once in awhile. The gears that hold the attachments have stripped out and the blender no longer works properly. I suspect that the chopper is what did it in. I'm giving it two stars because while it was working it was fine for blending things like soup. I contacted Cuisinart and learned that it's not repairable. If I purchase another stick blender I'll probably just get the blender and skip the attachments.
1,"great concept, terrible execution","Same problem as other people have encountered - the teeth in the plastic shaft strip, quickly. Why the rest of the product is so well constructed yet the critical component is so shoddy is beyond me. I have a ton of Cuisinart products and they're usually very good but this one is essentially useless.Surprised it hasn't been recalled."
1,Breaks quickly,"This is the second immersion blender I have owned. The first one lasted me 10 years. This one has lasted 6 months. The power on the blender is terrible and it breaks easily I used the included chopping attachment to chop onions, as per the suggested uses and the chopper broke immediately. The motor still seemed to work, but it never pulled liquids through very successfully and after about 10 uses the motor gave up. I will now buy a Kitchen Aid."
2,Poor design,"Purchased a little over 3 months ago. Teeth connecting the motor to the whisk have stripped out - leaving me with a worthless piece of junk. Metal teeth on the whisk end and a plastic socket on the motor end. Looks great, did a good job mixing, but beware!!!! Later edit: I thought I selected 1 star vs. 2 stars - It should be a 0 star product - site won't let me change the number of stars."
1,Useless,"Do not buy. Stripped the plastic gear the first time I used it. No reply from Cuisinart customer service. This is what happens when companies want to maximize profits by using the absolutely cheapest components. Real shame too, because the rest of the blender motor assembly seems like pretty decent construction."
1,"Okay but,,,,",This immersion blender is okay but the plastic is cheap. The plastic container is microwave safe yet the first time I used it in the microwave the plastic bubbles up.Plastic continues to be a problem for Cuisinart. It's like the don't understand the properties of the various materials used and/or the stress points that will eventually break.
3,Solid but lacking,"This is a decent immersion blender for the price, but its biggest drawback is that it has only one speed which limits its utility. I was disappointed in that, but it was my error in not checking before I purchased it. The chopper is more trouble than it's worth and I didn't actually keep it."
1,cuisinart smart stick,"I bought this for my Mom , who needed pureed food after mouth cancer. It worked well at first but within 2 months the cheap plastic parts that held the blade on broke. Since I bought it on Amazon it was too much of a hassel for her to send it back. I would not recommend this product."
5,Versitility inthe kitchen,Versitility in the KitchenMy Cuisinart SmartStick does it all. This afternoon I used it to chop nuts. This evening it mixed the chocolate batter for a marbel cake!In the morning I will use it to whip eggs. A wonderful and extremely useful kitchen tool.
1,"Motor works, but won't spin attachments!","I bought it new, it was a handy lil gadget! I used it maybe 3 or 4 times a month, for about 7 months. Then it stopped working! The plastic gears on the shaft are cheaply made, and won't turn the attachments! The motor will work, but I can't chop, whisk, nor blend anything! What a waste of money!"
3,Acrylic not properly cured,"I have had this set of Cuisinart stick mixer and mini food processor for a year. It has been used 2 times a week at least, hand washed and never through the dishwasher. The acrylic mini food processor bowl now has stress cracks in the bottom which will eventually leak. This is caused by fast curing the acrylic. The soft plastics are fine to fast cure but acrylic will never last any length of time before cracking if made that way. Acrylic is getting a undeserved bad reputation with me due to this issue."
1,Overheated and broke the first week,"I purchased this to replace my Braun hand mixer (which lasted 8 years of consistent use), and this one broke the first week. I was using it to make smoothies, so nothing too complicated. The motor got hot, and the casing started to break. Will definitely be returning it."
1,"Cheaply made, now in the trash broken.","I purchased this hoping to have an easier way to blend soups, and have a convenient attachment'tool' for dicing the usual garlic, onion etc.. Straight off the bat the small processor bowl coupling burned out and would not attach to the handle. I reluctantly accepted it's fate as I couldn't find the warranty and threw the bowl attachment away. Then, yesterday, the blade would not spin when I was trying to puree my soup. The coupling, or where the attachment fits the handle, burned out again, literally just spun inside its casing until it smoked! I am furious and will not be buying Cuisinart again, this is the second time I have spent hard earned money on their so-called 'quality, high-end' kitchen appliances, only to have them last a matter of months."
1,made like a toy,"I am not satisfied with this product. It was purchased o2/19/2010, it was usedonce a day. It broke within five months of purchase. I chose this product becauseI have Cusinart cookwear and I have been pleased with it. This product did not meet the workmanship that Cusinart advertises."
5,FABULOUS!!,"THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE, I'M A CHEF AND THIS PRODUCT SAVE A LOT OF WORK, TIME AND TROUBLE! I CERTAINLY RECOMEND IT."
5,I use this thing every day!,The whisk with measuring cup alone is worth the price. The chopper works fine but I have yet to really use the hand blender. My only suggestion would be to have the drive portion equipped with a hook so I could hang it in the kitchen. I use it that much.
5,a wonderful tool,"I don't know about the warranty stuff, and I've only had this a week or so, but I love it. I always hated ladling chunky soup into the blender, thence into another bowl while I did further batches, making a mess at every stage. With this I did a big bowl of soup, put the hand blender into it and in maybe 15 seconds it was perfectly pureed. Moreover, a note in the manual led me to using it every morning to froth the almond milk I use in my latte, at which it does a fantastic job--again, 15 seconds or so and way better than you get at Starbucks (though a good barrista can still do a better job with steam). Terrific."
1,Piece of Garbage,The design is nice - can't complain about that - but this thing will fail on you within a year or two; guaranteed. The gear that rotates the attachments is cheap plastic and it wears off making this thing unusable. Period.
1,Waste of money,"The knifes of the blender and chopper are positioned too high, they do not correctly mix the product. Big pieces of food (apple) were left untouched after blending.After some 2 months of use, the blender stopped working entirely. The plastic teeth in the motor unit, coupling the motor with accessories, became stripped, and do not engage the shaft. One can hear a whirring sound, but there is no action in the blender.The warranty service requires shipping costs both ways, which at $20 is 40% of the unit cost. There is no indication that the replacement will last any longer. I do not believe it is worth the money and the time.I will not buy the replacement unit (or any other kitchen appliance) from Cuisinart."
2,Returned This Item,"I bought this blender yesterday, brought it home, unpacked it, read the manual and then sat down and read the reviews here on Amazon. Although themajority of reviews were positive the negative ones caused me a great deal of concern so I took it back today. I will never know if I would have hadthe positive results of some reviewers who sang its praises because I wasn't willing to waste money on a product that might break in a few months or ayear. So, this is to ask future reviewers who are dissatisfied with the product to be careful in what you say and be sure that your complaints aretruly due to the Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Blender being defective and not to user neglect or error. Not only did I return this product but I nolonger have a desire to purchase any immersion blender and will continue to happily chop, blend and puree the old fashioned way."
5,It's a fleece sleeping bag,It is exactly what you would want out of standard sized fleece sleeping bag. It also unzipped all the way to make decent sized blanket. It keeps you warm in an air conditioned hotel room so I figure it will be just fine for mid 60 degrees and up. Packs up pretty small too.
3,Ike and Tina Shine on this cool tv show,"I like The First Edition and Kenny sure looks young but the songs they sing on this tape stink. Ike and TinA are fantastic! I feel Ike is a musicial legend that is sorly overlooked. Tina is much better in this stage of her carear. Gladys Knight is good too. Get Back, She came into the Bathroom window and Proud Mary are Ike and Tina's set list (which like the rest of the songs is mislabeled on the box) I hope people see this but for a fan of the First Edition there had to have been better footage somewhere. Don't Miss Ike and Tina!"
4,Great Phone Overall,"After doing extensive homework on all the phones, i decided on this phone due to the multimedia and readylink features. I have not been disappointed with either. i was aware that sprintTV wouldnt be that but about 15 fps and thats not hdtv quality but its still pretty cool. Readylink is clear in my area just takes time to get use to use the buttons. The camera and camcorder features are ok and anyone looking for professional quality pictures or exceptional video recording this isnt for you. The camera and camcorder are average but do you expect from a cell phone under 200. For the price and the money this phoen is pretty awesome and i have been extremly satisifed. Oh by the way dont throw the manual away because this phoen as so many features."
1,Don't Even Think About It!,"The only thing worse than this phone has been Sprint's response to addressing the phone. This phone began dropping calls about 90% of the time a week after I bought it. I took it to the Sprint store which my warranty directed me to and Sprint stated it was Sanyo's problem and I should contact them. After several emails, phone calls (using a land line since my $350 phone wouldn't function), & me reading word for word the warranty that came with the phone I purchased 3 weeks prior, Sprint stated if I took it back to the store, they would exchange it. After researching on the web, the dropped calls are a common complaint which Sprint has chosen to ignore, instead passing the defective phones on to their customers. I've been a satisfied Sprint customer for 8 years but this phone and Sprint's response leaves me feeling like Sprint has been deceptive. I will not remain a customer."
3,Try some of the others first.,Amateurish at best. Many of the tracks sound like they were performed on a Casio keyboard by someone who had nothing else to do. Mechanical whistles?!
5,Works Great! Thank you.,It came quickly and was the perfect fit for the unit. Very happy with it and would recommend to anyone.
1,Wasn't what I thought it would be,I thought this would plug into the car mount but it doesn't; it plugs into the receiver which prevents you from being able to use the car mount; so you have all the power you need but no way to plug in the antenna or headphones; at least not without having other parts than just the car mount. So this just doesn't work for me.

2,blue rodeo,blah blah blah....sounded good...but can't get into it at all..and I always give a novel several chapters to pick up and take me away...this didn't
1,Another great book from JoAnn Mapson,"JoAnn writes great stories with believeable characters--people you know or want to know. Her stories are hard to put down. You can feel their pain and their joy and her endings leave you wanting more.This is a story about new beginnings, old pain and good friends. I highly recommend it. I've never seen the movie but plan to do so. Kris Kristofferson was a perfect choice for the lead roll."
3,No easy sight adjustment,Gun requires an allen wrench to loosen up and adjust the sights- don't like that.The gun may be pre-set with sights already adjusted-Product not tried out yet.
2,"I've really tried, but I can't get into this one...","I absolutely love ""Fire Within"" and ""A Circle is Cast,"" but this seems to be a radical departure. I've had this CD for years and have tried every so often to listen, thinking maybe I would appreciate it with time, but I cannot. It is a harsher sound, interesting, but not something I find easy to meditate or relax to. It has a totally different feel from Libana's other CDs, more Eastern European/Middle Eastern. Some may find this more energizing/danceable than their other works, but it was not what I was looking for."
2,Cheap! but still useable,Cheap! but still useable. Inside had a stained piece of paper/cardboard?... Flimsy leather. Not recommended.
1,don't buy,"Awful quality product, the leather looks wornd out, while the lining is torn and frayed.By far the worst product I have ever bought on amazon.Did not returned it because it was cheaperto trow it away."
5,Hard to find keychain,"My father-in-law carried this kind of keychain for YEARS, and it broke recently. Went Christmas shopping with my mother-in-law, thinking I could pick up a new one for him, but after trudging through countless stores, we couldn't find anything close. Came home, searched on Amazon & found it in about 10 seconds. Great quality, arrived quickly and my father-in-law was very happy!"
5,Just what I expected,It is everything I expected. It replaced a well worn keycase of the same style. Hope it holds-up as well.
4,Soft leather,Nice for the price. Serves it;s purpose. The leather is soft and durable. Would recommend this product.
3,Keychain,"The leather quality and finish was below what I expected. No sure how id, money and keys can fit all at once. Fast shipping and processing."
4,You can not find this anywhere else,My mother in law loves this! We looked high and low for this little gem and found it here. It was of good quality and the price was right. She was delighted with it!
4,Powerful sucker,"This is a cute, powerful, versatile vacuum cleaner. The only drawback is the short battery life (~15 mins). It's great for quick cleanups, car cleaning, and to clean hard-to-reach areas."
3,battery died too early,The battery started to fail to hold a charge well after about two and a half years. Not user replaceable so time to fill the landfill :-(
5,Love this,"I use this every day. I have little ones in the house, and this cleans up the high chair, the floor, and I even took it out to clean up my car. It has an attachment on the bottom that lets you get into crevices and cracks very well. I find the strength of the suction to be adequate for anything I've used it for. It's very easy to remove the collector and empty it. Definitely recommend. I should have gotten one sooner!"
3,"Good, not great","Bought one in 2005, still have it. But wall charger, mount is mediocre.Performance, when we can use it, is excellent. But that is rare anymore, due to thecharger/mount problems."
4,Portable Hand Vac,"The B&D 9.6V Cyclonic DustBuster is powerful and comfortable to handle. This model has a clear dust and particle collection container so you know when it's time to empty it and clean the filter. In terms of design, it has futuristic clean lines. If I had to name one potential improvement, it would be to light weight it slightly, otherwise it lives up to what I purchased it for."
3,Black & Decker Dust Buster Review,kinda cheap....and isn't super powerful. the head is a rather inconvenient design too. probably would not recommend.
2,Bad suction,"Our unit had pretty pathetic suction. I don't know if it was just one defective one or not, because we returned it and got the 14.4v one instead. That one is incredible!"
2,"Works great, at first...","I have had this product for about 2 years. When we first got it, it worked great--lasted about 10 min. at a time. Now, we're lucky to get the floor cleaned up under the table before it starts to wear down. Also, the clip which holds it to the base just broke, and I see that I am not the first person to experience this problem. I don't see anywhere to buy a replacement base, at this time, so I may end up just throwing the whole thing away."
1,Doesn't bust any dust,"After junking the Dust Buster 7.2V loser after about 10 months, I mistakenly bought the next more powerful one, the 9.6V version. It lasted about 4 month and wouldn't hold a charge. Buy another brand."
2,Not as great after a year,"I admit, this was a great vaccum for the year that I used it but after the year was up, its age started to show. It had a tremendous amount of power and could vaccum for up to 7 minutes before it started to die. At the end of its lifespan, it started to fade right after I started using it so I got about two minutes of slowly dying suction power.At this point, I've had it with cordless vaccums. I'm going to a corded model for now and leaving the cordless for the times when I need to pick up a few crumbs, as that's all it can do now."
5,Very Nice Job,"I have been using this vac for the last 4 months, and i am very happy with it. I usually use it for my car, but occasionally I also use it indoors, to pick up my kids mess. It works very well. Good suction."
5,Good Buy,I bought this product in $17. In this price its a very good buy and i found it very powerful also.
4,More than meets the eye,"When a mild-mannered accountant is shot in the face with a shotgun, execution style, Banks and his team are trying to find out why an accountant was killed in this way. As they investigate and dig deeper into Keith Rothwell's life they find more secrets and evidence of dirty dealings. It certainly isn't a simple, straight-forward case, and even the Home Office is involved. What I love about Robinson's Banks is that he's such an everyday Joe. This makes him totally believable. The other characters in the books are also well-drawn, and the plotting and mystery are always complex and not easy to figure out. In short, this is a series that is a cut above your ordinary British Police Procedural, and I really am enjoying it. This is the sixth book in this lengthy series, and I am looking forward to reading more."
2,Almost too painful to watch....,"First, let me say that I've been a fan of the Captain & Tennille's music for nearly 30 years, so I was really looking forward to this collection. But, ouch, it's even more schmaltzy than I anticipated. Don't get me wrong; there are some good numbers,and you get a music video for ""Do That To Me One More Time"" among them. But the shows...gosh. Toni is SO ""perky,"" SO impossibly gah-gah over every guest, and the skits are SO lame that, even for the late 70's, it's hard to see how this stayed on the air for any length of time. Buy the CD's...skip the video."
3,"Great Music, Bad Comedy","The Captain and Tennille as an act, are extremely likeable people. They are very talented musicians (whether you prefer their particular BRAND of music or not), but they weren't cut out for the 70's variety show format. It's probably why the show only lasted a year. The skits are uncomfortable and dull (we can place blame on the writing as well). Sonny and Cher and Donny and Marie best pulled off the comedy AND music routines involved with the typical variety show. The good thing is that there's quite a bit more music on the C&T shows then there are comedy routines. That's a good thing. I think Toni has a terrific voice, and I still enjoy checking into their website once a month and reading Toni's weekly blog. Great, down to earth, untouched by hollywood and its whackiness couple......that's why they couldn't quite pull it off."
4,Lazarillo de Tormes,"I think that this book was great. It teaches many lesson to people that need help. It's mostly for people that actually understand that language. The language is like ""Castellano"" from Spain, but the ""Traditional Version."""
3,Major Problems but Still Fun,"A decent one-playthrough game title. There are 15 missions, with only a little variety (mostly charge forward and beat the next boss). Even with sometimes massive slowdown and even sound glitches under heavy fire (such as sound cutting out--and no music!), this game does provide some good 3rd-person blasting action.You'll find that the main impetus to continue is not the bosses or new levels. Those really all look too similar. What attracts is the weaponry you find as constant upgrades. Some of the later weapons pack a VERY meaty punch in effect, visuals, and sound.Guaranteed, though, once you defeat the stupidly lengthy (easy, but requiring 15 full minutes of repetitious attacks) end boss battle and see the ""ending"", that's it. It's done for good."
2,A mecha-sized letdown...,"Slowdown? On the Dreamcast? In just the intro even? This isn't right, but it's the truth.""Slave Zero"" could have done so many things right and ended up doing so much wrong. With overly linear maps, a graphics engine that crumbles to a grinding halt when any significant number of enemies is on the screen and quite possibly the worst multiplayer I've seen in a long time, the only reason to pick up ""Slave Zero"" is if you are a total mech otaku and see it really, really, really cheap."
4,Fun at a good price,"This has to be one of the funnest games that I have ever played for the Dreamcast. The graphics and sound are really good, and the game offeres unlimited replayability. This is a ""must have"" for anyone who wants to have a good set of Dreamcast games."
3,Fashion bracelet,"The bracelet is beautiful, nice design, but should not be advertised as magnetic because is less than 1000 g which means is not healing"

3,NOT ALL ORIGINALS,"BEWARE! All of the songs of the Association were re-recorded, and although they sound okay, they definitely are not the originals that you hear on the radio. However all of the Turtles' songs are the originals and sound great."
5,Fast Delivery and great product for being used.,"This book came in a timely manner, had no sign of being used. It was a hard cover, which I didnt expect (BONUS) but didnt have the paper cover.Great job!!"
5,I Agree...Vincent Had A Better Voice Than Presley,"I know this will sound sacriligeous to the Elvis fanatics, but an objective appraisal of Gene Vincent's and Presley's voices would lead most music critics to concur that Vincent had the better voice of the two---especially on slow ballads. His range was wider, his tone more subtle, and he did not sell out to commercialism and the trite, almost juvenile tunes like ""Teddy Bear,"" and ""I'm Stuck On You."" Vincent was not particularly attractive physically, and so he did not catch on as quickly or as pervasively as did Presley. But lest we forget, singers are not supposed to be evaluated by how well they swivel their hips or by how well they pose on stage with their sequined costumes, vaudeville-style sunglasses, and sideburns that go on for miles. Rather, singers should be assessed by how well they sing. Using this meaningful criteria, Vincent was a better singer. Elvis did have a larger belly, however."
4,Abbastanza,CarinoAnche se sicuramente si potrebbe fare di meglio penso che il suo prezzo debba essere di 50 centesimi k
2,Trivial and fictional,The author Ovid Thomas description of guyana and its people and culture is very trivial and fictional. It appears that Mr. Thomas spent most of his time researching guyanese folk lore in lieu of researching the rich history of the Guyanese people.
3,Good to watch every now and then,"The biggest problem is, the sound, and no closed captioning, so alot of gags are missed. After that it's a very funny movie, in a Big Trouble In Little China kind of way. The movie is far out, except it, sit back & laugh. Don't look for OSCAR material here.Chevy's girlfriend leaves him, he gets doused in nuclear waste,and wreaks havoc with hilarious results."
2,Unmoved By Telekenesis Comedy,"What do you call a comedy that's not funny? A must to avoid. This film struggles desparately to make you chuckle. I laughed maybe once in a scene where Chevy Chase's character, an air traffic controller with newfound powers, induces an orgasm in his girlfriend (Patti D'Arbanville) without physically touching her. A lot of the blame for the film's failure is in the performance of Chase. We are told, by other characters natch, that he is a cold heartless manipulator. There's nothing in his performance to suggest that. Chase's work here is pretty bland and one note as though he wishes he were somewhere other than here. I can relate because you can do better than watching ""Modern Problems""."
4,Hilarious,"Well Chevy Chase has made some horrendous movies over the years....this is not one of them. He plays an air traffic controller who is splashed with toxic waste and gains powers which enable him to move objects.The scenes in which he uses his powers are outrageous....the restaurant, the opera house, etc.So for a really good comedy, one of Chevys best, this is it. Its hilarious!!"
3,Nunsploitation for beginners,"A well packaged two disc set. The first is the film itself,set in a nunnery and surrounds, featuring the heady relationships between various nuns, and the impact of a stranger's arrival. Well presented in the main, with good clarity and colour. Leisurely and well framed, if lacking in story detail and characteristation. Well, what did you expect? Not as explicit as it is represented, but reasonably frank sex scenes. The second disc is an interesting documentary about the film maker, including various excerpts from his films. Exploitation fans will enjoy this romp, which enters fairly violent realms, but sometimes (thankfully) is so badly acted and presented (make up)that it can't be taken too seriously. A guilty pleasure."
5,good rendition,"I recorded this off the air many years ago and enjoy viewing it every year or two. I am surprised that it is not out on DVD, the cast containing several very famous acting people such as Goldfinger, Inspector Clouesau's boss, and the chaste and tastefully sexual Elkie Sommer."
2,Stiff and Thin Would Not Buy,I purchased these because of Prime free shipping as they are more expensive than a very similar product at WalMart. The quality is inferior to other similarly designed square silicone pot holders. They do work but the stiffness makes it harder to grasp a pot or roasting pan.
4,"You'll still need a set of old-fashioned potholders, but these are very handy to have","These are very good for larger pots and pans, not so much for things you might need more dexterity for (say, holding a metal spoon, adjusting a folding roasting rack, or picking up a pot lid by it's knob.) They're about the thickness and have about the same flexibility as a weekly magazine. I've found that placing my thumb against the 'hang-up hole' provides a bit more gripping control. I recommend having a conventional (thinner) pair of potholders at hand as well.I really do like these, though - great for dealing with large pans, and best of all they clean very easily and don't absorb water (ever take a pan out of the oven with a potholder that's been sitting on a damp part of the kitchen counter? Ouch!)I wish my silicone cake pans were as thick as these, and that these were as 'flexible' as my wiggly cake pans..."
4,red silicone trivets/potholders,"This product is nice and flexible. Perfect for taking things out the oven, holding the side of the pot when cooking, and keeping hot plates on top of. The button-type texture allows for a firmer grip when transporting hot plates, pots, and pans. I think the hole that is suppose to be used to hang the trivets on is a good idea, it is in a corner and i guess can allow for burns but you just need to be careful and make sure that part is away from the hot items. This a great alternatives to the silicone gloved potholders because i find those to be more stiff and bulky, making it akward to handle hot items with."
5,"Nice, quality visor",I liked everything about this visor. It was exactly as it was described. The color was even the same shade as in the picture. Good quality as well.
1,NO NEW BABY REVIEW,"I do not recommend this book for children over 8 years old. It is a caring book, however, I expected more out of it. It shows concern by a child, however, it should have been recommended for ages 5 and under.I had a loss and when my child finally let out her feelings, I thought this book would be of help, but it wasn't. My daughter was a little too mature for this book and she is only 10."
2,"Leave this one to the sci-fi devotees. The book is ""hard science"" fiction, not much of a novel","The problem is an endemic one for sci-fi: the non-hardcore reader often doesn't feel drawn to the characters or the plotlines. That reader, such as myself, often feels that the characters are at the service of some ""hard science"" idea: they are useful gadgets to help bring life to Mars, peer into alien ships, or--in this case--get going a space elevator. The who and why of the novel become rather forgettable. Of course, the best sci-fi says so very much more, but this book, I'm afraid, is typical of swaths of the genre that serve only to explore a futuristic idea."
3,"Stupid Title, Good Book","This book was well written, accurate, and all in all, a good book. The first half was excellent, the true story of Elizabeth Bathory, who legend says bathed in the blood of young girls to make herself beautiful. That's not true, but the real truth is just as bad. She was responsible for, in her own estimate, about 650 deaths of young girls. McNally is a great historian, and knows his stuuf. He also is fortunatly a good writter. But the reason I gave the book only 3 stars is because the whole second half of the book was horrible. It loosely ties into the Countess' story, talking about vampirism, lycanthropy, and necrophilia in history, books, and movies. This was not to my taste, although it might be to someone else's. If you are interested about the Countess, read the part about her, and then stop."
2,WORKS GREAT!,"I have only had a couple blackouts that were short lived since I got the lanterns, but I put them on immidiatly, I am very happy with them much better than a flashlight for this purpose and definately safer than candels"
3,Bodum Glasses,Already broke one just by dispensing ice from the fridge. Apparently you have to gently place the cubes of ice into the glass or the inside will break.
2,Eeriness Left in Awkward Twilight...,"When a female friend of a group of seven returns to South Korea after a two year long visit to United States strange occurrences begin. These occurrences are related to the death of a woman that the seven friends once knew and it seems that the same dead woman is returning to them. The dead woman's return seems to be linked to a videotape that they all know about, but the question lies in what is on the tape. Nightmare is a horror film with some eerie moments and gruesome scenes, but the awkwardness of the story removes the engaging theme and leaves a flat cinematic experience as the suspense rests solely on separate incidents."
3,In Golden Blood,"After raving about the first two books in this series, I was a bit let down with this installation.Natalie Lindstrom is back and with no money and few job opportunities is finding it hard to make ends meet. A job comes to her attention that could help solve her money problems, but she must leave her daughter and travel to Peru to pursue it. While helping to contact the dead to find long lost treasure, which she has been told is going to a museum, Natalie becomes involved in kidnapping, fraud and murder.Of all of the Violet books yet, this one seems less personal. I didnt feel the connection I usually do to Woodworth's characters and this book seemed almost a little rushed. I do, however, look forward to the next in the series and hope it captures my interest as the first two were able to."
4,arrived safely at their destination,"very good quality, but must treat that comes in plastic gaskets sealed well, because I miss one and it appears in the image"
4,Highly Recommended,"Perhaps the biggest failure of this product is the lack of documentation on how well this camcorder operates with Macintosh. Using a 4pin to 6pin Firewire cable (not included), this camera easily connects to Macs making an easy tranfer into iMovie for editing. In fact, I couldn't find any mention of how to use Firewire with this camcorder.This camcorder is extremely small and I was concerned about how well I would like the small controls. I was very surprised at how easy the controls were to use.Picture quality is very good, even in low light conditions. In-door shooting will usually require the whitebalance to be manually set because in auto mode lighting is yellow, but it is as easy as clicking a menu item.It also makes transfering from VHS to miniDV easy with the enclosed cables.I'm giving 4 stars due to the documentation."
3,Useful but expensive and poorly produced,"Lots of useful information, particularly the tips for debugging release executables, but very poorly produced as a book.The copy I received (and returned) appeared to have been made from a badly cropped set of bound photocopies. This is completely unacceptable at this price."
4,Sounds like Boston!,"This solo project released by Barry Goudreau of Boston during 1980. This features Brad Delp on vocals as well as future Boston and Orion the Hunter singer Fran Cosmo. I think the best song of the album is ""Nothin' To Lose"". The sound of the album is very similar to the early Boston demos, the sound is something that anyone who wants to hear more Boston like music would enjoy! Also check out RTZ, another Boston related band with Delp and Goudreau."
5,i was so happy to find this,i always wanted the barrgooreau solo cd. i was shocked to see it for sale . i never thought i was ever going to find it !!!! i've been taking a trip down memory lane listening to it. great price too !! if your into Boston i highly recommend this . hats off to ya' amazon !!!
4,The Real Third Boston Album!,"For all of those of you who loved ""Boston"" and ""Don't Look Back"" you will definitely enjoy ""Barry Goudreau"". This disc features 3 of the original members of Boston and of course Delp's soaring vocals which are a real treat.Fran Cosmo (who later replaced Delp in Boston and shared a stage with him after that) is also showcased on some songs, but his performance isnt nearly as good as Delp's. Delps songs could easily have been pulled from the Boston debut album, they're that strong.Best tracks are ""Dreams"", ""Sailin' Away"", and ""Mean Woman Blues"". Check it out!"
4,It's got everything I wanted in a Bible...,"I'm always fascinated by studies of Biblical women, so this Bible has been good with its little ""snapshots"" of interesting women in the Bible. There are study notes on each page which, for the most part, you've probably already heard somewhere else, but now and again they surprise you. There's cross-references and tons of space in the margin to scribble your own thoughts down. (That's one of the best parts!). The weekly studies are well-written and thought-provoking, but even though they are ""weekly"" studies they are not structured like that."
5,Excellent Bible for Women,I had no Idea what this bible would be like but I'm a woman so I'm interested in the women of the bible in particular. This book is excellent for more in depth study of the women of the bible
5,A Must Read For Many Investors,"This is a read not to be missed if you wander what is going on in today's corporations. Elliott and Schroth have come as close as anyone to date in looking at the entire problem facing todays corporations head on; not just all the accounting and finance problems. They don't mess around either in explaining their position. Agree with them or not, they lay out a very serious issue very simply and straight forward. What I find amazing is that WorldCom, Bristol-Meyers /Squibb, Nortel, Xerox are all discussed in this book. I found the Wharton review below the most helpful and probably the most credible of all the reviews on this book."
1,"fun for a few tosses, then boring","OK for a gag gift and a few minutes of entertainment, but not if you paid more than $2 for them. I paid $12. Not worth it."
1,stevia sucks,"If you're sensitive to taste, beware of this product. The Stevia combined with the liquid calcium is an atrocious and horrific taste."
5,Great,"The CDs worked perfectly fine.The box showed a rip, but whatever, I wanted the CDs lolNo complains here"
5,I WANT MORE!,"I love the series. A ten year old boy, Negi teaches a class of highschool girls but he is no ordinary boy and his students are no ordinary girls. Its filled with adventure, excitement, and magic. All I can say is I want a sequal with more magic! More transformations! and more about Negi and Haruna!! So check it out and watch out for the biggest ending twist ever! it will have you crying and jumping out of your seat!"
2,Dismal,"This video is not what I expected, very poorly done, contend dismal.Even though I like mr. Penland and have met with him in the past. But this kata explanation is very poor."
5,Wow! Great camera!,"I just got back from my local electronics store which, to my surprise, had the GS35 in stock and on sale. I was very pleased with the ease of use and accuracy of the thumbstick control. Though, the menu button was a bit out of reach for my thumb thus requiring me to use my other hand to push it. The built-in LED lights help shed some light on dark situations, but I noticed an even greater benefit from the increase in gain when the light was switched on. The lens used on this camera is out-of-sight! Not only does it offer high telephoto optical zoom, it offers what few other camcorders out there have: built-in wideangle. The lens is 1.9-57mm which equates roughly to a 35mm equivalent of 35-1040mm. So, go ahead, shoot video indoors and get the whole group in the shot at once!"
3,Super Camcorder,"Very pleased with the camcorder, have had it 2 months. It has been outstanding in every aspect. I was considering the panasonic 3 chip recorders, but ended up buying this unit. The big factory was the 30X Zoom lens.It really paid off. The battery life is fantastic. I use the video light, it doesn't effect the battery life that much, but really is necessary for lower light. This is the 4th camcorder I have owned. I really liked how comfortable it is to hold. It is about half the size and weight of my last camcorder. Editing and recording back to the unit very easy using firewire port. I use ULEAD Video studio. Make DVD's and record finished movie back to the MiniDV tape for archives. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone."
3,No Straps,"not bad, but nothing to hold them ontothe bucket seat. Will have to attachsomething to keep them in place."
3,decent product,"i purchased this cake board for a 12 inch X 18 inch X 4 inch cake. obvisously the cake was very heavy. The cake board was big enough for me to fit the cake on nicely and had room to write happy birthday on the board as i hate writing happy birthday on my cakes, any way, i felt the board was thinner then the description made me believe. When i buy cake board for my smaller cakes they are usually about an inch thick, this board was maybe a 1/4 inch thick, so when carrying, needed to be held from the bottom as opposed to how i usually just hold it on the sides. the design was nice, shiny silver with the print, did make the cake look beautiful, my only complaint is that i felt it should have been a little more sturdy but at $5.00 definately a great deal, however do feel i was ripped off with the shipping price, which was $11.00 for an item that was less than 4 lbs"
2,NO DRIVER COMPATIBILITY,"I bought this camcorder recently and I was very happy to see its results initially but I can never believe on thing that it is not compatible with windows xp properly, I called up panasonic help center they suggested me that I should buy firewire cable for its better performance because this cam is suppose to be designed for Win98. now I am all stuck with these things to figure how to take care of all these things..."
4,"Very good value, but image quality only ok","I did quite a bit of research on video cameras but I am by no means an expert. I selected this camera in the hopes that the image quality would be a lot better than my older JVC camera. Although the colors are a bit better, that is all you seem to get for the 3CCD. I love the small compact size as well as the features and ease of operations. It is a bit uncomfortable to hold in my hand, it seems better suited for someone with smaller hands. I wish it had a built in Lamp for low light."
4,Great little movie with lots of heart!,"Saw this film in the theater with its Australian title Bran Nue Dae. I don't know why they changed the title, but I absolutely love this film. Great music and lots of fun."
2,Pop-Metal Sabbath,"If you're looking for the classic riffs and unsettling lyrics that made Black Sabbath into the band most easily assoicated with the term ""heavy metal,"" choose another record. ""Headless Cross"" is far from Sabbath's best. It's a very dull, pop-metal-sounding album that made me run screaming back to ""Black Sabbath, Volume 4.""The musicians on the album -- Tony Iommi, Cozy Powell, Tony Martin, et al-- are, of course, great. However, the songwriting consists of clunky, boring riffs coupled with lyrics that are made up of silly horror movie cliches.If you want a good Sabbath album from the Tony Martin era grab ""Eternal Idol."" ""Headless Cross"" will leave you feeling a little more broke and a lot more annoyed."
2,Iommi's Great........Martin's lyrics are not.....,"What in the world??? Tony Iommi puts on another great solo show (I don't care what they say, this isn't Black Sabbath) with his sledgehammer riffs, but Martin's lyrics are really pushing the edge....I guess it's a Satan hero worship thing with him...Why Iommi allowed this kind of imagery, I don't know....Ozzy and Geezer really let Tony I. have it after the release of this disc....The rewards of Hell??? Have mercy.........."
1,"A sad, sad compilation","Okay, I really wanted to like this compilation, so I had to give it some time before I could come to the following conclusion: These are [cruddy] CDs. I cannot justify listening to these songs, no matter how much I like them, because the recording quality is so insultingly bad. Boy, did they scrape the bottom of the barrel with this one. I did not pay good money to hear distortion, fuzzy vocals, muted sections, and, get this, A RADIO ANNOUNCER GIVING HER STATION'S CALL LETTERS DURING A BROADCAST! Love Little Feat? then don't listen to these CDs."
4,Well Made and Fits Vehicle,"When I received these floor liners, I was a little disappointed in them. They are thinner than I expected and the surface is slicker than I like. I also do not like the raised lip on the door side of each liner. It is higher than I would like forcing you to be careful to not hang your foot on the lip when entering and exiting the vehicle.However, they are well made, they fit perfectly and they stay in place. I would like a heavier floor mat like Husky's heavy rubber mat that I bought from Amazon."
1,over complicated piece of junk!!,HDMI??????? 7.1??????? I have just spent the better part of 3 hours working on this POS and I'm no better off now then when it was in the box. This is not true HDMI when you need additional cabling just to get volume. I thought I'd give Sony the benefit of another try. Not again!
4,Joining the List,"Man...what a disappointment! I'm joining the list of people who had to turn this thing up to 50+ to get decent sound (""max volume"" coming after 73). I started the initial set up doing a speaker check and after 15 mins of thinking I'd done something wrong in connections and looking everything over, I turned the volume up from 13 (which I thought would be sufficient), to 30 and lo and behold, I heard the test tone.I will commend the product rep at Sony for spending over an hour with me (albeit prime time cell phone minutes) and trying everything in the book he could think of. I'm sure he was scratching his head when, at the end of the conversation, he said ""maybe it's your speakers""! When I told him the Bose Accoustimass 5.1 system I have cost more than his amp, he said ""hmm..."" right before I thanked him for trying and hung up.I've sent this thing back (bless Amazon and their policy) and I'm going to try an Onkyo amp....we'll see."
4,Excellent Product,System provides excellent sound. Easy to set up and operate. Seemingly infinite options to satisfy all needs.
3,HDMI did not function for me,The HDMI is only a pass through. It did nothing for me. As a result I could not use the Receiver for what I purchased it for. However it has some very good sound Fields and has a good quality of sound for its price range. I returned it for an Onkyo 804 but paid three times as much for the Onkyo. The receiver from Sony actually sounds better on the FM than the Onkyo. The Onkyo is an HDMI up converting receiver and works very well at simplifying my system set up. The quality of sound is not to much different between the two receivers when playing CDs or listening to DVD movies but the Onkyo is better in both of those modes. The Sony is better with FM sound.
5,Westlake's Best,"One of Westlake's very best. A priceless pre-Columbian dancing Aztec is stolen and shipped to New York with a dozen copies. Naturally it gets mixed up with the copies and several groups try to recover it. A scene on a boat, when Mel puts his foot in the sand-washing bucket is priceless. The scenes with Pedro puking his gulpe all over the pilot, and many others are wonderful. And only a master would think of describing the mad scramble on I 80 from the vantage of a high-flying hawk.. A very rich cast and plenty of funny situations. The ending is a surprise. I am currently on my fourth reading and enjoying is a much as ever."
2,Not Up to Date,"This is a good book for American Hallmarks BUT, it is extremely out-of-date. Also, many entries do not have a picture of the mark, making identification difficult. There must be a better book out there somewhere!"
4,"Still profane, but rocking out better","The second album by the Fugs is a marked improvement over their first album. The playing is tighter and the executions are a bit more polished (God forbid!!) ""Dirty Old Man"", ""Kill For Peace"" and ""Doin' All Right"" are hilarious songs. Here is an example: ""I'm not ever gonna go to Vietnam. I prefer to stay right here and screw your mom."" The Fugs also prove that they can rock out with abandon such as ""Frenzy"" and ""Group Grope"". This CD gets no points for sound quality though. Be prepared for relatively low fidelity. The lyrical content contains the same sexual innuendos and profanity as the first album."
5,Near or Far or Very Middle East,"I bought this album in my youth based on ""Kill for Peace."" Ironically. Or sadly. Nothing has changed in 40+ years. The lyrics are just as topical now as they were during Vietnam. I discovered the Fugs retroactively from the Mothers of Invention and the Velvets. They were throwbacks to the Beats, whose influence I was too young for, and too radical for most post-Beatlemaniacs. They never had the pretty folk-rock harmonies or mainstream potential of the Byrds, Love, Jefferson Airplane. However, the first and second Fugs albums have stuck with me because they were singing about big issues, silly juvenilia schtick, and poetry. The music is minimal. The singers, well, can't. There's poetry. Mayhem. It's punk before anyone ever thought of the term. Get this and the first. Good stuff for those who like their garage rock cerebral. RIP Tuli."
3,A workplace guide written for management,"Interesting guide to many different personality types and how to handle them in the workplace. Not very practical for everyday use. This book seems to be written as a workplace management tool. Although, many people are combinations of more than one of these personality types, it will help you understand what truly does make them ""tick""."
1,Don't Bother,"This ""updated"" book is dated and boring. Examples range from the ridiculously crude, to those that fit into many categories. This book was ""recommended"" to me by Amazon. The lesson learned is that they have no basis for making recommendations except one of profiting. Do not waste your money on this book."
1,How People Tick: A guide to over 50 types of difficult people and how to handle them,"Perhaps the author should have started with a definition of difficult! Secondly, I don't believe I picked up any useful tips. Don't waste your time with this nonsense.How People Tick: A Guide to Over 50 Types of Difficult People and How to Handle Them"
4,Great addition to my Thanksgiving holiday!,"Coincedental, but I wound up reading this book during the Thanksgiving season! Entertaining....and endearing. Lucy was juggling husband, family (in-laws coming, first-time home for college student + college pals + the 3 children still at home), friends, her career, and the mystery. Lucy did it well! Good read!"
4,deeper love,it always happen when the record issues an greatest hits album they always leave out that one hit or to back in 1987 she recorded deeper love from the golden child its not on here but this set is very nicei think she looks better ib the 1980s then now i like that big hair she had
5,Comprehensive Crash Craddock!,"This collection truly has all the best of Crash Craddock! I just wish I had bought it a couple years ago when it was still available. I keep checking on it every time I'm on Amazon, hoping it is back in publication. I've got an old cassette with most of these songs on it, but long for this CD! Billy Crash Craddock music is truly a taste of 70's country that we all miss. These songs bring back lots of memories!"
1,Pain in the butt,"This worked great the first couple of times I used it, and then it refused to seal reliably. Sometimes I could tweak the gasket and get it to seal, but usually it just failed. Meanwhile the food is madly boiling away its flavor. I always followed the directions to a T, carefully hand-washing the gasket and never dishwashing the lid. A waste of money."
5,Who knew an Elephant could be this cute?,"This little doll looks exactly like the illustrations, is soft and cuddly (if you're a three year old!)"
5,Fun Game,"Exciting and intense game. Just wished there was more to it such as different kinds of weapons or something else unique from the previous games and sometimes the sound goes off but very rarelly. Other than that I'm happy about the purchase, its nice to find a game that delivers without much advertising unlike a lot of these games coming out lately that do the exact opposite."
1,Just plain ridiculous--went into the trash!,"I thought this would be a romance about a nanny who seemed to be like an angel, not a nanny who really WAS an angel! It started out with the angel showing up naked in the hero's yard, and went downhill from there. The angel, in the guise of a nanny, has sex with the hero(it was somehow ""approved"" by higher authority!) At the end, the angel/nanny disappears and the hero doesn't recognize her when she shows up again as a person, but she seems somehow familiar so you are to assume that they get back together again. Anyway, the plot was so silly that I couldn't even take it seriously. I don't expect my romance novels to be totally true to life, but when it comes to angels running around naked and having sex, it is too far-fetched for me to even get into the story. What a waste--glad I bought this one used so I didn't feel so bad about throwing it into the trash."
3,Smaller than what I expected,"I bought this pillow to replace a similar pillow. I was surprised that this pillow was less expensive than my previous pillow but when I received it, I finally understood why... The material used for this pillow does not keep the shape of your hand when you put it on and the pillow is smaller than a regular pillow. It is not uncomfortable but you can find better for 5 dollars more."
1,Roundabout,Readers with basic exposure to image processing programs may benefit by first looking at books in the Visual Quickstart series for Photoshop before considering this book. The Quickstart book I have is more concise and easier to reference questions towards. While this book's descriptions of some features is good there are problems with getting to the point which can be a hassle. I did not find the C-D of use so why do I need to pay for it? This book is almost 3 times as expensive and about 3 times heavier than the Quickstart manual. They both cover the same material so I think this is not the best deal or the best written. ...
5,This book does and has it all!,"This Photoshop Bible is THE only bible for Photoshop. Anybody wanting to learn Photoshop, or learn more about Photoshop should purchase this book. I have been a Photoshop user for many years. I have learned techniques from trial and error. This book taught me more techniques than I will ever know what to do with, but are worthy enough to know just in case. Money worth spending."
1,PANASONIC STINKS!,"So, you go out and plunk down nearly 600 bucks of your hard-earned cash for a Panasonic PB-GS65 DV camcorder. It is a digital video camcorder, after all. That's why you bought it. Well, guess what? It doesn't come with a DV cable to plug it into anything. That is so pathetically stupid I take it as an outright slap from a company that must think I'm just some sort pain in their shorts. It cost me completion of a project that I had to put together as soon as the camera arrived. So, Panasonic, I'll post a negative review of as many of your products I possibly can over the next few weeks and make you pay as much as possible for being about as stupid a company as I've ever had to deal with. Oh yeah, and you're camcorder is being returned. Go buy a cable and have a ball."
3,A Special Moment,"Imagine being able to witness Brian Wilson performing his ""Pet Sounds"" live in its entirety, note perfect beginning to end."
5,Great Deal,I was extremely impressed with the length and quality of this DVD. By far the best WWE dvd to date.
2,old wine in new wineskins,"Wanted a copy of Cyrus the Great. This has ""leadership"" headings like it were a Steven Covey book. Would prefer the original."
2,A quantum of Xenophone,"Having read Xenophon's Anabasis as a youth, I was excited when I saw another translation of one of his works on the bookshelf. But now that I have read a few pages, I am going to contact Xenophon in the underworld about getting himself a good attorney.While I am unsure of the status of copyright laws in ancient Athens, I am sure that Larry Hendricks has created a cause of action. Signed litigiously Jim Silverman"
5,Art Commemorating an Event,"I thought this book was very nicely done with regard to graphics and written elements. It really gives you an insight into how people deal with tragedies in their lives, and the process they take to rebuild them. Very inspirational, as well as informative."
3,TV level documentary,"This is a fine addition to your ""TheBand"" collection. While not anywhere near the quality as The Last Waltz, it serves to introduce us to the early career of these great and legendary musicians."
5,Excellent shark attack book,"Ambrose does an excellent job of bringing all of the elements of a shark attack to the reader. He is a very good writer. He paints pictures with words, which is what good writers do. The portrayal of incidents in Kauai are especially gripping. I had difficulty putting the book down. I bought this book ""out of the blue"" and didn't even read the customer reviews (which I usually always do). Don't miss this one."
4,Wait Until Reissue!,It will be out on Wounded Bird Records on the 17-don't buy expensive imports. A great album that is long overdue for reissue.
4,Shipping,Manufacturers carton used for shipping. Manufacturers carton should have been put in an outer carton to prevent breakage of product.
5,Really Good,"A simple and satisfying snack! Very crunchy and lots of flavor--even though they are plain. Substantial chips, eat a few and feel satisfied."
5,Awesome taste,"This is one of my favorite chips! It is so good. I just take it in mornings or with lunch to satisfy the chip cravings if I have. I am certainly not a big chip eater, but when i want to have this ranks in top.Has a good crunch feeling due to Pita. I like with no extra flavors and everything combined gives this a great feeling. < edited to reflect suggestion in comment. >"
5,Helpful direction for meditators & wannabe meditators,"Great title, huh? This is a very helpful book for the beginner like me, addressing the repetitive, boring issues that the ego thinks makes you too unique and special to meditate. When she's sounds like she being obscure or isn't answering the question, she's just speaking to a different part of the person than the rational mind, the taming of which is one of the purposes of meditating. If you want to meditate but are afraid of pain, worried about doing it right/wrong, don't have enough time/strength/discipline/quiet, find parts of your body falling asleep, etc., check out this quick read. I also like that she hand-letters her books, with delightful little line drawings added in every so often."
4,good mystery//great music,This Charlie Chan entry is 1st rate.The racial slurs might offend some people///remember it was made in the 30's//. The original operatic music was composed by Oscar Levant and it is quite good. Boris Karoff is an extra added attraction. The production is excellent and the supporting cast is in top form. This is an enjoyable 30's who done it..Sit back and enjoy this film
2,Angels Would Fall CD,"I was extremely disappointed that I paid the amount I did for a 3 song CD album of Melissa Etheridge. Nowhere on the ad did it say it was a 3 song CD - I don't even know why it was published. But, I'm a MLE fan, so I kept it.Kathy Mang-Haag"
3,Not needed if you heavily tab the reference manual,"Quick Reference only contains equations found within the main reference manual. If studying from the main book, this quick reference is of limited usefulness if you know where everything is in the big book (e.g. use lots of the sticky tabs)."
4,good game,"this game is good.similar to GOW, good graphics and moves.the only complain that i have is: i can't make some movements that you see on the move list. i don't know why.but is good, but far of GOW."
5,No words to describe what's in this blu-ray,"I cant really say nothing to explain the level of complexity, graphics, awsome acting and masterfull orchestra music and sound effects that lie in this little blueish disk. If you've loved the God of War saga as any sane person on this planet who owns a ps2 (or 3 now) then this is a must have. Although God of War and God of War II are 6/5 stars, Heavenly Sword is a 5/5 no doubt about it !! Must have ps3 exclusive for any ps3 owner. Get it now!!!"
2,Too many combo button mashing but amazing graphics. Epic.,This was actually the second PS3 game I ever played. Graphics and cut scenes of landscapes was amazing. You can see the detail and work that went into it.Had a hard time memorizing so many combos as distinctly prefer games without combos. Ended up using 2 or 3 combos for the game now.Why 2 stars? The combos got to the point I ended up putting the game aside for 2-3 weeks only to start again to find did not know how to play anymore without going to the combo chart to relearn them. Right now more so using the 2-3 moves and hoping the mashing gets me through.This was also the first use of the motion control of the hand controller which used in the other character - very fun after the learning curve. Fly with your arrow takes on a new meaning.The graphics saves the game but the play value would be a rental. The British accent on supposed Asian characters was a distraction.
4,Never Before Seen Graphics !!,"I'm sure this is the best looking game ever made to date .. Graphics are so realistic you start getting confused weather it's a game or interactive movie ..Chapter's difficulty is fairly good .. not too easy and not too tough. nice blend for casual games ..People say it's too short, but for casual gamer like me .. it's just fine .."
4,"It was a fun game, until...","Well, the game is short, and also pretty easy. However, it was extremely funny. At least until the last boss battle started! The latest boss fight difficulty was extremely high compared to the rest. I reached the final boss in around 6 hours, but it took me about 2-3 hours to beat it! I was about to break the controller! I think nobody tested out this final stage. Camera angles were pretty bad, also the boss design.I discovered an easy way to beat the game that I had not found anywhere else. I will not get into details, to avoid spoilers. If you need help, just write a comment."
1,Mistaken Identity,"As mentioned in the other reviews, the publishers of this volume simply (and I do mean simply) copied a videotape of medium to low resolution and authored a DVD with a single menu item - PLAY. The image quality is so bad in parts that it is difficult to discerne what's going on in the video, and the explanations about what the instructor is doing are sparse, if any are given at all.Perhaps when the original video was mastered there wasn't much out there in the way of Japanese sword instruction. If this is still the case, then there is a good market for some quality instruction and creative authoring."
2,Boring,This video is just boring. The picture is not to good but watchable. I hope this is the only video this guy ever makes. I do have to give it 2 stars just because it does show a lot of stuff. They maybe should explain more.
3,Installing it is a problem. Better backup your computer before installing it,"The product is ok, getting the proper installation done is a challenge. It messed up my laptop configuration during installtion itself. Every friend of mine have had issues during installation.There is hardly any support available from UBI Soft"
3,cute for me not for the hammy!,"this is so ultra adorable but it was a total waste for my hamster, luckily I had her cage set up extra huge so I could keep them in there and it didnt bother her and it looked great. I wouldnt reccomend this to anyone though. Hamsters dont seem to care one way or the other for it."
2,What the...?,"Well, if you are expecting the signature sound of THievery that we all love, you aren't going to find it here..no way. None of the cool percussions or downtempo beats. It's all jazz. 75% vocal jazz...it doesn't fit the mold of these artists. So if you are looking for sounds of the Thievery, you might want to skip this one and buy one of their previous albums."
1,"Crass, shallow, and anything but elegant","How about calling it ""The Call-Girl's guide to f*** etiquette?"" As a fabulous girl, I was appalled. Bought it, read it, returned it. Is that a faux-pas?? Apologies to social dilettantes Kim Izzo and Ceri Marsh."
3,VERY INTERESTING,"I was so glad this when this cd came out. I was finally able to listen to the ""mature"" David Cassidy albums released on the RCA label in the 70's. My humble opinion? Only ok. Sounds very dated some years later. Still, there are some good songs to be found. ""Common Theif"", ""Get It Up For Love"" is excellent, and ""Tomorrow"". Fans should check this out."
2,Not worth it,"While comprehensive in its coverage of investment banking activities, this book provides very little detail, less analysis and no insight. The actual relevant information this book provides would be summed up an introductory chapter of a better book. An example of a better book would be ""Global Banking"" by Ingo Walter and Roy Smith."
3,HMMM! Bowling HUH?,"Well i'll be, a bowling game huh? Not as bad as AMF but not as good as Cricuit Pro 1&2 or ten pin alley, this game offers a variety of bowlers, balls and locations to test your bowling skill. The fun of unlocking various characters and locations is great until 10 minutes later you realized that everything is basically done and you have nothing to look forward to. Well how about winning money in tournaments? Well 5 minutes into gameplay I found a mark in the gutter that allows you to shoot 300 for 6 games without resetting the oil averaging 300 for 87 games you get bored with winning tournaments. If you dont cheat, the game is more challenging. Not bad but not good either!"
5,Best bowling game EVER,I played lot of bowling games and this is the best one. It really gives you full control of the ball. Just make sure you set the accuracy all the way down! And increase the curve and power in the edit profile setting. You have to do this to make the ball hook. Otherwise it will only throw straight balls. Unless you read the read the instruction booklet you wouldn't know this. I suspect lot of people don't know this and wonder why the ball doesn't hook.
5,Food to fill the hunger of a man's soul,"Joseph Jastrab writes each paragraph like a poem. He beckons the reader into his world with a sense of love, courage and vulnerability. This book was the impetus for me to go on his vision quest many years ago. It has changed my life. It is easier for women to make deep connections than it is for men. As men we are hardwired biologically and societaly into a culture of competition and resulting loneliness.Joseph's book can give a glimmer of the world available to men when we open our hearts. I have given this book as a gift many times and each reader was rewarded by its wisdom."
3,An Interesting Yarn.,"I was born in the Corps. My old man was a jarhead. If what Freedman reports is true I dont believe my dad would recognize today's Corps from what it was during Korea. From what I know of the other services, Freedman may be telling the truth. But what he writes reminds me of the blarney bloviated by companies like...say...WAL-MART. I worked for WAL-MART, and what they practice aint what they preach. Theyre not evil but much of their PR is hype. And this book comes across as PR hype. The idea of the Corps being ""Care Bears"" blows my mind away. I mean, if theyre doing everything Freedman claims, can Hospice-work and wedding catering be far off? Freedman writes well. I love the Corps, so the topic is interesting, and the book is engrossing. But I dont believe a word of it."
4,Excellant!,Blackie and the boys did extremely well on this release. Its the best rock/metal release of 2002 hands down. Blackie Lawless can our write any artist on any given down. Damn good job WASP!
1,BOOK DEFECTIVE,This is not a review of the book as in the story but the physical book itself. In the middle of chapter 25 the next page was chapter 28 and almost every page there after was screwed up.I bought 2 copies and cannot contact Amazon to fix this because the window for returns has closed.This is a faulty product and it is thier mistake. This is not a defect that was readily noticeable and Amazon needs to make this good.
5,Australian Cast Brings Live Show to Life,"The Australian Cast really breathes life into the Rocky Horror Show! Listening to it makes you remember what it is like to be at the live show. This recording sounds gritty and real. The members of the Australian cast could take on the cast of any other live album with one hand tied behind their backs (especially the Magenta)! If you love live music and The Rocky Horror Show, the Australian Cast version of The Rocky Horror Show is the one for you!"
5,Great way to end the day!,This is literally the last thing I read every evening and more often then not I wake up in the morning with praises to The Lord in my mind!
4,Like it,I am enjoying this evening devotion book. I just wish there was more for each day. I really like the messages though and it is very inspirational.
3,Sweet Soul Queen of New Orleans - Irma Thomas,"Some nice songs, but the quality of the recordings leaves much to be desired. Scratchy sound - Doesn't seem to be digitally remastered."
5,Total Perfection!!!!,I recently got this CD and fell in love with the voice of Irma Thomas all over again! This Cd is pure delight..music in it's true form. I did notice a bit of a scatchy record sound in a couple of places but for me that just added to the joy of it all. I am thrilled this CD was not digitally remastered. Pure sweetness...buy it...you won't regret it.
3,Informative Historical Fiction,I bought this book because I had just returned from traveling in Turkey and wanted to understand the enormous historical and cultural shifts that occurred here from the perspective of a family. This book ws informative but was more oriented toward the insular family situation rather than presenting a wider historical perspective.I did enjoy the book and recommend it as more of a family saga than an historical novel.I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I knew how to do a half star.
4,Sweet!,"I admit this isn't what I'd get if I was buying new, but recently I got this at a yard sale for diiiirt cheap, and it works great. My previous camcorder was tape, so for me this DVD cam was an upgrade. It's fairly easy to use. I like that each time you record, regardless of length it creates a thumbnail on the screen for easy navigation. It can ALSO be used as a regular digital camera. There's a SD card slot, pop one in, set the dial to SD and start snapping pics.Comes with a rechargable battery pack and power cord, and a cord to TV for watching. I bought TDK cdr's and they work fine. Nice neck strap too."
2,The time has passed. Don't do this.,"Do not buy this - time has passed this by. It's cheap, because you can do so much more now than you could in 2006. You simply cannot manipulate the videos you take on this - no USB connection to upload to a computer, no software to make changes if you could. Get a miniDV or something more modern. The miniDVD has passed. May it rest in piece."
5,Highly Recommended Ethel,"If you want a well recorded and definitive CD of Ethel Merman, you should get this one. You would have to buy many individual CDs to get ""the best"", otherwise. Yes, she can!"
2,Proof you get what you pay for.,"Very disappointed. Car looks like an eight year old painted it. Would have given it 1 star but dislike the 'I hate it' tag. I won't be able to give this as part of gift for my brother. Will probably return the product. Do not recommend, except maybe as a gag gift."
1,"Missing the point, somewhere?","Er... so this was probably misfiled in the comedy section; all it is is a couple of discs worth of a woman talking, with an audience whooping and cheering whenever she mentions a particular section of society. There's some awfully uninspired material about Scotland, as though the mere fact of travelling to a foreign country was somehow incredible, and the rest is some strange form of observational comedy, omitting the comedy. Perhaps Cho is some kind of avant-garde performance artist, who wanted to see if she could be reliably unentertaining for the entire show, and still have the crowd laugh at her. Except for the 9-11 joke at the start, and if that is the high point, that really says very little.Other reviews suggest it might be amusing if you can see the audience reaction, which implies either you should buy the DVD instead of the CD, or alternatively that the audience does all the work, because it certainly doesn't seem from listening to this that Cho does."
4,"Funny, but she has better material","I have all three of Margaret Cho's comedy cd's and this one is really funny, but her other material has been much funnier. If you buy this cd thinking she does a lot of material about her family and her mom, she does not. Much of her material on this cd is very gay-oriented and VERY adult. People who are not really into the gay scene may not understand where she is going with all this."
2,Not that helpful,"While this book offers some theory and concept, there is not much hands-on practical information. I searched a variety of books to assist me, a mental health professional, to be more effective in court. I read this, then Ceci's book, then someone recommended Stern's book on Preparing and Presenting Expert Testimony. That was far and away the best."
5,2012 Toyota Tacoma,"This receiver is perfect. As others have mentioned it did come flopping around in a box, but it didn't poke through and the powder coat was in perfect shape. Installation was easy, but it does help to have a friend hold the hitch in place as you put the bolts back in. Also, you should get a torque wrench to both loosen the bolts and torque them back down to the proper torque setting. The receiver itself is tucked away perfectly with just the 2"" opening showing. I wouldn't spend three times as much for the dealer hitch, this is just as good if not better."
1,"Will ""Spirituality"" save the planet?","If you divide ""religion"" from ""spirituality,"" as this author does, then everything evil, oppressive and negative can be blamed on ""religion,"" while ""spirituality"" emerges pure, perfect and with cosmic messianic hopes attached to it. Many cliches from the 1970s and 1980s are found here, and American readers may wonder why the Irish author, who lives in London, needs to restate them unbothered by any of the later criticisms and discussion. The reviewer who commented on how ""dualistic"" this book really is, and how blind its author is to the style of argument he himself uses but castigates, was right on the money."
5,"A great, positive soundtrack!","Like so many others who have reviewed this CD, I was first exposed to Lost Horizon when I was a freshman in college, away from home and very homesick. My dorm counsellor let me borrow her vinyl album and tape it; this tape got me through this transitional year with a positive outlook. Unfortunately, the tape broke, I changed colleges, and could not find the album anywhere. I'm so glad to have finally found it...just listening to the musical exerpts brought back wonderful memories. I can't wait for the CD to arrive"
5,Lost Horizon 1973,"This is the true diamond of the film world! I have loved this film since the first time I saw it all those years ago. It has stayed with me throughout my life, I am 37. I still remember most of the songs and when I am having a not so great day I think of any of the songs from this magnificently uplifting film and life is wonderful again! It is such a feel good film and like one of the other reviewers said, it is just what we need in these frightening times of terrorism. If you haven't seen this film then I am truly sorry because you have missed out on something that would change your life forever! I cannot praise it enough, it is gold...PURE GOLD!!!! Bravo, Bravo!!!"
4,A Delight Almost Lost,"The songs from the much maligned musical of 1973 are a delight to hear and the lyrics a delight ponder. The production was panned for various reasons -- among them: the music being too upbeat or frivolous for such a serious subject, the principal cast having almost no Asians, a plethora of Western values inappropriately transplanted into the esoteric milieu of Shangri-La, and being just plain ""corny"". However, the lamented Westernized emphasis was not only traditional in Hollywood but understandable because the film was designed to appeal to Western audiences. Regretfully, some material deleted from the original released version due to poor audience acceptance has become lost over the years. Thankfully, the final released version has been preserved. Apart from the justification of some of the criticisms, perhaps the critics failed to appreciate what the 14th Dalai Lama has often stated: the purpose of life is to be happy."
3,"A key phrase... ""as if""","A bit of wisdom from this book that I'll carry with me... ""as if""... I apply it regularly. I did not give this book more stars solely based on the fact that I was put off by the violence of one passage."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,I was pleasantly surprised at how well this cake tin kept my cupcakes fresh and moist. I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in keeping their cakes edible with very little fuss.
3,Acura MDX License Plate Holder,"This item is sturdy & secure, but the black inserts on the lettering fell out after about 3 weeks. Maybe this is an improvement.CK"
2,little and dirty,"Cute SkippyJon, but really little. Came in opened package and was dirty on the white parts. I washed it with Clorox wipes and it came almost clean but overall it was a disappointing purchase"
3,Very cute but small,"It was a gift for a friend who loves these books. However for the price I paid I was expecting a bigger doll. It was only 6 inches tall. My friend used it as a Christmas ornament, which was cute, but not quite what I had intended. She still loved it."
5,I'm in love with Skippyjon!,"A friend recently gave me a gift bag that included Skippyjon Jones. As a children's librarian I was quite familiar with Skippyjon and Judy Schachner (The Grannyman is one of my all-time favorite books!). I have a Skippyjon t-shirt, but that pales in comparison to this doll. He is adorable! All Skippyjon fans need to add this to their collection!"
4,Very small stuffed animal,"My 5 year old loves Skippyjon. It is a cute stuffed animal, but I didn't read the size of it. Was a bit disappointed that it is such a small size."
2,Too small,Although the character is small and perhaps this doll is supposed to emulate that.... the product itself is still too small. It resembles a Happy Meal toy more than a $9 product.
4,If only...,"If only RCA would issue H&J's ""Live at the Country Club"" on cd. Then the world would find out just how great this duo was. The recording was produced by none other than a young Chet Atkins and their backing band was Boots Randolph and the Coral County Car Strippers. Many of the songs from this compilation are performed but their sly humor and natural comedic timing are showcased only on the live album. If this is all you can get ahold of then get a copy. For now I'll continue to cherish my vinyl lp for the rest of my days."
4,Great little pack,"I wore this to a paleontological dig and it was fantastic for keeping me hydrated without having to stop working to swig out of a bottle. The water also stayed surprisingly cool, even in the 90-degree weather. It made it much easier to carry the water I needed throughout the day and not once on the week-long trip did things start smelling ""mildewy"" like regular water bottles tend to.I've also worn this kayaking--its skinny profile fit right underneath the splash skirt and I didn't have to stop paddling to take a drink or worry about losing a water bottle.It does NOT have a lot of storage space--I was only able to fit an energy bar, 1oz bottle of sunblock, and a small digital camera into the pockets. If you push and shove you CAN get a trade paperback book in there, if you don't mind scuffed spines. The bungee did work great for my gloves and jacket.Bottom line: If you're not going to be toting a lot of stuff, go for the Dream. If you want to carry a lunch, go for the Magic."
5,One of the greatest albums!,"I purchased this CD because I liked a couple of Sonny's songs. I didn't recognize many of the titles, and when I played the album, I was amazed at how many ""big hits"" Sonny James was famous for. I can listen to this CD (album) every evening, and never get tired of it. It's truly one of the best album purchases I have ever made. Truly a GREAT pop-country album for any collection!"
4,It worked,I got this book to help my 4 year old class understand the world around them just a little better. 4 year olds are just realizing others have feelings and to care for their friends. This year's group just wasn't getting it. I read this book to them. Afterwards I asked what Peace felt like for them. I got some great answers. I offered the book to another teacher and she too felt the children understood the book and got a lot out of it. It isnt a book you read and just put back on the shelf. Lots of talking about each page and the class adding their thoughts. So if you want a book that helps a child to think get this one.
2,It's a manual rather than a book,"The photoshop bible is actually an alternative manual for adobephotoshop. (If you haven't bought photoshop and need a manual this isan expensive way to go.This is good to have as a reference book, but if you're looking for real-life examples of improving your photoshop techniques this is not the book for you.The book is clearly aimed at beginners and the author focuses too much on the basics rather than giving real life examples. It's also not a book you can read or follow from cover to cover - It's like reading a dictionary. In my opinion at least 150 pages of this book should have been filled with examples - instead I found very very few examples.So, if you already have a manual - keep it. If you need one, buy this one. If you need to learn photoshop better, buy a book with examples."
3,Good DVD,"I can't wait for the full season DVD's but until then I'll have to settle for this compliation. It has some good episodes from this series, six to be exact. But my two favorites from this show weren't on it {Shame}"
1,worst show of all time,This show perhaps even surpasses One Day at A Time as the worst show in the history of television
5,ALICE THE COMPLETE SERIES IS HERE,I haven't even bought this DVD because I was looking for the complete season and what do you know ..... I found it!!!!! It was Just released at the end of June this year. Search the web and you will find it. I found it on ebay and a sight called DVD-TV-ONLINE.COM. I am so excited because I LOVE ALICE. I too watched it as a child. I am 38yrs old now and I am still excited about it. I've searched for this for years and finally it's here. Now all we need is ONE DAY AT A TIME. We already have PIPPI LONGSTOCKING with INGER NILLSON.
3,A Good Book,"I've read this book some time ago and I thought that it's a good book about how people rely on their faith after what happened at Columbine.However, I'm very skepticial that there were any ""matyrs"" at Columbine, and that I don't think that any Christians were specificially targeted(including Rachel and Cassie)."
4,Has the Spirit and Cadence Down,"A very nice read from Mr. Moore. Well paced and well stocked with voices at once familiar and seemingly authentic. A good meditation on the rights of outsiders to interfere with the affairs of State, and on the split loyalties between serving man and God. This book is in a similar vein as Black Robe (also by Brian Moore) and Monsignor Quixote and The Power and The Glory (by Graham Greene)."
1,Nevermore is not worth reading!,"Nevermore is one of the worst mystery books I have ever read. It has a lot of potential, but did not keep my interest after reading four chapters. I not going to finish it because it is so boring. When I first picked the book up I thought that it was going to be one of the best thrillers I had read in a long time. I was very wrong"
1,anchovy paste spewed a mess in pantry,"I bought a 12 pack of this exact product about 6 months ago. It was not from this seller. They were kept in a cool pantry in a kitchen that is always temperature controlled. I used one right away. It was good. They all say Best By:Jan 27 2012. Today is Mar 2011. The remaining 11 have all swelled up, unrolled the end, and the contents has spewed out. I am throwing them all in the trash. I had previously purchased a 12 pack of Amore Anchovy paste and had them in my pantry for nearly two years as I used them all without any issue. I will stay away from Crown Prince. My packages say Imported From Morocco."
5,It's all about Jimmy!,"I will watch any movie that has Jimmy Cagney dancing in it. Forget the gangster flix, give me the dance numbers. I don't care about the plot as long as Jimmy dances! If you feel the same way, watch this film."
3,Fun but hard,This is a great game especially if you love tmnt. Its a neat concept but man it is a tough game. But overall its a pretty fun game.
5,Worth every penny,"So, I've got some pretty thick hair and need to use a good round brush that's large. This one? I love it! I am sold for life on these brushes. I like the curve of the bristles that DO allow the brush to get closer to your head. The durability of the bristles is also great since I use the hottest setting to straighten my hair out.If you need a good round brush, don't buy a $12 one at the drug store. Spend a few bucks more and get one of these brushes!"
3,ok brush,"This brush is larger than what I expected and too large for me. It does work well for blow drying is it is quite effective at pulling hair tight and allowing for style control while still being gentle enough not to pull your hair out. This brush has made my hair very very prone to static problems, but in its defense I have only used it in the New England winter and this may be less of a problem in humid environments. This brush is probably a decent choice if you aim to volumize your hair while you blow dry it. Since I have 22 inch thick hair I dont need extra volume and it leaves my hair looking a bit too big."
3,Give it a second listen,"Compare this to ""Fillmore East"" ""Eat a Peach"" and their best works and it is going to come up short- no question. But compare it to the work of most other bands and this still comes up smelling like a rose. Dickey gets off a good instrumental in ""From the Madness of the West"" and Gregg's 7 minute composition ""So Long"" is a really great number. There are some songs not up to the usual Allmans standard here but there's still some very good stuff here. 3.5 stars."
4,used and abused,"I teach video production at a San Diego high school, and bought six of these for the class. After seven months of the kids use and abuse, all but one camera are working perfectly. The kids are extremely rough on the cameras in spite of my best efforts, and I'm astonished that they continue to function so well. The one camera with problems has a broken screen, no doubt from abuse, but is still functional using the viewfinder. I'm confused about the complaints on battery life, with my kids leaving the cameras on for an hour without problems. A nice feature that may not matter to most people is the microphone input, which is not standard on most inexpensive cameras, but very useful in getting good audio during an interview situation. The picture is not the best, but very adequet for the projects the students do, which are shown on a 34 inch TV. Overall the camera is an amazing bargain, and built to last."
4,Nice Intro but incomplete,"First, the strengths: Andrew gives intelligent summaries and discussion of some major historical film theorists, with chapters on Munsterberg, Arnheim, Eisenstein, Balazs, Kracauer, Bazin, Mitry, Metz, and Ayfre, and Agel. He focuses on the debate between the formalists (who believe film art is defined by its formal properties including editing, framing, mise-en-scene, lighting, and etc.) and the realist tradition (who believe that film art is defined by its basis in photography, a physical impression of its subject). The highlight is undoubtedly Andrew's excellent discussion of the great French critic Andre Bazin, which is not surprising since Andrew's Ph.D thesis was on Bazin. The weaknesses: This was published in 1976, and so it completely ignores the vast body of criticism published since then, especially feminism, and the influence of Lacan and psychoanalytic theory. Still, this is not a bad starting point for students of film theory."
4,Good introduction,"Just as the book states, this is an introduction to film theories; and as such it fulfills its promise. The explanations and discussions are almost always clear, at times somewhat rarefied, but overall an authentic book."
3,Meh++,"I came to this book with high expectation based on the mention in ""Sorcerer and Sword"". Because of that, I ended up a bit underwhelmed.Good book. It moves fast, the ideas are fresh even though it is working the ""Arthur"" field. A few of the images will stick with me and I may reread it. Ultimately though, it was a good airplane read."
1,Rip OFF!,The picture makes it look like you get 4 or 5 treats....NOPE! You get only 1 dinky little treat for a whopping $9.16. Seriously????
1,RIP OFF!!!!!!!,I have been buying these Redbarn bones for a year now and usually get them for under $2 a bone -when I saw a picture of multiple bones for $9 and change I thought I was getting a good deal and then I received ONE bone!!! I'm really pissed right now and I'm going to report them to Amazon.
4,A Nice packaged collection,"A very attractively packaged CD. Nice color photo's illustrated in an informative booklet. All The tracks bar one can be found on Bear Family's 4 CD Box set ""Bonanza"" which contains all the albums Lorne Greene cut under his Ben Cartwright persona.This set includes ""Waco"" a single he cut in 1966 based on the western of the same name. This is the single version of ""Waco"" and not the movie cut featured in the film's opening title sequence.All the tracks have been digitally remastered to first class sound quality (Just like the Bear Family set).The album cover is almost identical to Lorne's ""Welcome To The Ponderosa"" album, but there the similarity ends as this is not the same album.This album released in 1997 has been long deleted so prepare to shop around as the price is very high for this rarity. You may have to sell a piece of your own Ponderosa to buy it!"
3,Read the graphic novels instead,"I am an avid Superman fan and received this book for Christmas. This is a prose adaptation of the Death of Superman, World Without a Superman, and Return of Superman arcs which appeared in the comics. Normally, when authors adapt comic books into prose, they expand upon what the characters are thinking, allowing the reader to peer into their innermost thoughts. Unfortunately, this adaptation falls far short, choosing instead to stay faithful to the superficial story.However, this book might be appropriate for a younger child who lacks the patience to read all three graphic novels. This book does an excellent job of condensing all three graphic novels into one story, but unfortunately that's all it does."
3,a shame about the cold,"The dvd is good, but I find it rather annoying that Jason has got a nasty cold. It screws up hisvoice and takes away his fire..."
3,Poor fit,"I bought the Husky Liners only because the Weathertech liners were not available for my truck, and I thought these would be close. These liners do not closely follow the contour of the floor, there's a weird bump on the driver's side, and they even leave a gap on the passenger side near the kick panel. The grey color didn't match the carpet to well, and if I had to do it again, I would order black.On the plus side, they are made in the USA, have a lifetime warranty, and I do believe they will serve their purpose.A friend bought the Weathertech liners for his truck, and I like them a LOT more than these. I would recommend the Weathertech liners."
4,An addicting pleaser in a proven form,"Although Might and Magic 7: For Blood & Honor is not very different then it's predecessor, Might and Magic 6, it is just as fun. I admit that this game doesn't do much for originality, but I don't think all new games need to be original. This game takes a winning formula and just uses it again! If you liked #6, #7 is more then worth it. If you didn't like, or were ambivilant toward #6, then For Blood & Honor is probably not your cup of tea either."
1,"A rehash of MM6, with a really bad 3D engine","More of MM6, with a ""new"" 3D engine that causes more problems than it is supposed to solve. The poor 3D implementation makes it virtually unplayable. MM6 was worth the money. You couldn't pay me to buy this game again."
3,All that and more,"After reading the other reviews, I have to say I agree with both ends of the spectrum, this is a mindless slash and hack focused on money and experience (kind of like life - only you can restart MM7). But at the same time, I find myself sitting there for hours killing the bad guys, and trying to get that next level or skill. Sort of like a sitcom of adventure gaming."
2,i thought!,for the price i thought i was get'n all 3cds but just one! wasnt happy with that! but should of read the descriptions. :( music is good tho!
2,software is too troublesome,"This is a good book in many ways, but I have to subtract a star for the unacceptable hoops you have to jump thru if you want the electronic version. And even if you do install it, there are serious limits as to how you may use the material you just paid for.Sybex is one of these outfits that feel their customers are crooks, and they never let you forget it.Too bad, because some of their material is good. It's really tough to justify this product as a new purchase. If you can find it used, maybe then."
5,A Great Find!,If you love poetry and prose then you can't go wrong with this book. It is moving and filled with inspiration. I have even given copies of this book as gifts. This is one book I will always have on my bookshelf.
4,Incredible Compilation of emotions!!,"I bought my first copy of this used because i had seen a few stanzas ofLorca's works and his name kept showing up in books and other works of people i loved or respected. I still love lorca but this book gave me so many other authors and poets to love and look for. i truly had no idea how passionate and incredible the spanish poets and authors were and are. i guess they should add another gener of works for ""spanish expressionism"".ps, i'm writing this right before i buy another copy, i just given the one i own away for the 3rd time to another good friend."
3,Moderately Pleased,"It has a nice appearance and is made out of wood. Our sink had two-hot water handles. It is not that durable. Still, I would rather have it than something made out of plastic and it fits our small house well."
4,"fun, compact, inexpensive, not plastic","After much looking around, and being unwilling to fork over $150 for a nice heavy wood kitchen, I got this on a whim for my almost-2 y.o. It's been in the house for only a few days, but she *adores* it. The quality is passable, it might not last for a second child, but the play value is great.PLUSES:- Wood, not plastic- No noises/voices, etc. other than ones the child makes up- Oven looks like the real thing (window, handle)- Unisex colors- Sink is big enough to actually put in play dishes and ""wash"" them- Compact and lightweight, yet sturdyMINUSES- Strange paint smell, which I hope will dissipate- Edges not sanded down in spots- Water knobs fit loosely and wiggle a bit (feel cheap)- Seems expensive for the size- Oven magnets too strong to open door without having to hold the entire toy -- I put felt stickers over the magnets to lessen the pullOverall, a neat launching pad for the imagination. (LEGO DUPLO is also great at that sort of thing.)"
3,"Fun, but not as great as it would seem","This kitchen is cute, but it's A LOT smaller than the photo and product descriptions let on. My daughter is a small two-year-old, and she has to kneel at it to play. It's certainly not large enough for more than one child to play at a time. After opening the oven door a couple of times, one of the wood pieces holding the magnet that keeps the door closed fell off. Hopefully a little wood glue will fix that problem--it's just disappointing that a brand-new toy already needs fixing. It's not the high-quality wood toy that I'd hoped it would be, but my daughter DOES enjoy playing with it. Hopefully it'll survive a year or two."
2,Poorly addresses real-world HCI applications,"I found very little useful information from this book and it seemed a little out of date. A large percentage of the book talks about mathematical and biological issues related to the development of eye-tracking which I have little interest in. If you are looking for a book that will introduce you to eye-tracking in the context of HCI (or specifically usability), you will be disappointed."
3,"Alright, but rough fabric","I bought these to go along with my Creative Fitness pull-up bar since I had read that doing captain's-chair-type exercises were one of the best ways to build your abs. While these are sturdy and work well, the material/fabric is a rough nylon that has given me burns on my upper arms, even when I'm very careful not to swing while doing my abs exercises. I've been putting soft, folded towels in each loop so that the material doesn't rub my skin as much, and so far that seems to help a lot.Bottom line: effective product, but could be made of better material. I'd give these 3 1/2 stars if I could."
3,Ab strap review,"My son was thrilled with this purchase. Hesitant at first to try putting his whole weight into the straps, he now enjoys the workout the straps provide with his door gym."
4,Good Product,Worth the buy. Best retractable pen I've used yet. I would recommend this item to anyone who needs pen that can write beautifully and is also cheap to buy.
4,Great,"I like this pen, the only reason I don't use it 100% of the time is because of the grip. its not a reason to not buy it though. its not that big of an issue"
5,The Search Is Over! Love These Pens,"I am so glad to find these pens on Amazon. I purchased two boxes. What makes them great - fine point, ball-point (not a fan of the roller balls and gel pens), ink dispenses smoothly and evenly when writing. And, as a rule, I like retractable pens - no caps to keep track of and no worries that the pen tip will come into contact and bleed ink on clothes or my purse lining(of course unless I forget to retract the pen!). All around great pen and great price."
2,Not what I wanted,"I bought this pen because I am so sick and tired of pens not working when I take notes for class. It will write completely fine, but then will just not write sometimes. I am left handed and I noticed that I have to pick pens more carefully because of the angle I write with. Also I write small so this may be a factor. I originally was going to buy the Zebra F-301 (which I have no problems with), but decided to give these pens a try."
2,Very cute lights but not electrically stable,"These lights are cute. But the electric cord is well soldered into the plug, comes loose and then shorts out the bulbs."
4,They're Scissors,"They are just kid scissors - no frills. The holder works great for my family, but probably wouldn't sustain a classroom. Worth the price."
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book regarding the subject or topic - in brief the multiple dimensions of ""prayer"" as understood and used in various cultures and times."
2,Horrible attempt at glam rock,"So I was talking to my cousin Larry and asked him what kind of music he liked. He said ""Katy Perry, Nickelback, Alice Cooper, Coolio..."" and I asked him who this Alice Cooper chick was. Larry told me that Alice was a cool female singer who did some glam rock stuff. I love glam rock like The Darkness and Jeffree Star so I bought this album because the cover art caught my eye because it was hawt. MAN, this album was stupid. It was just a total Jeffree Star rip-off. DON'T BUY THIS, you're going to be disappointed. This is NOT glam, this is simply a joke. But I'm giving it 2 stars because the cover art is really sexi!"
4,"""Goes To Hell"" the Coolest!","This is a worthy follow-up to ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" in which sick Alice finally is sent to the place where we all knew he would end up . .and escapes in the end!Alice shows his sense of humour on this release with ""I'm The Coolest"";""Give The Kid A Break"";""Guilty"" and ""Wish You Were Here"" .Great storyline;best ballads.I defy anyone to call this a ""disco""album.It is worth money alone to here the Coop sneer,""I'm guilty,and I don't care!""."
4,WARNING: MAY CAUSE PSYCHIC VISIONS,"This album has great ballads and a few decent ""hard rock"" songs like ""Guilty"" and ""Didn't We Meet"". But beware if you are spiritually sensitve like me. This is one of those albums that gives me prophecies, and past life views into lives of those already deceased, with visions of cemetaries,funeral homes,death,destruction,depression, loneliness, & the end of the world. Those who know what I am talking about often get the same feelings on certain albums by The Who, especially in ""See Me Feel Me"".GOOD ALBUMS, BAD KARMA!!!"
1,Ever Kink,I agree with the other review. We've been fighting this hose for 4 years and will replace it before next season. It's on a hose reel and even when pulled straight out it kinks up. How they can call it NeverKink is beyond me!
4,Good traveling dryer,"This hair dryer has nice power in low and high. It also collapses nicely. I will be using it internationally, so I hope it is just as powerful when the voltage is converted. Quality product."
4,Sharper Image Traavel Hair Dryer,"I am very pleased with the hair dryer. It worked fine in Europe, whee I returned from a recent trip."
1,Piece of you know what.....,"I bought this hairdryer because I read some of the positive reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I must have gotten a bad ""one"" because it was useless after one use. The 1st night I used it the actual base of the hairdryer got so hot that it nearly burned my hand. The 2nd night it blew the adapter out of the wall and blew the fuses in my hotel room. My sister bought a $13 hairdryer from Target before our trip to Ireland and we actually used that the entire trip without a problem once this one blew up. Buy a cheap Conair with a good converter and adapter in lieu of purching this one...."
1,This movie was awful,"This was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen (surpassed only by ""Battlefield Earth""). I have enjoyed David Lynch weirdness in the past (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, etc.) but this movie was just terrible. Imagine three hours of ambient music and random nonsensical scenes with no connection whatsoever, not even a semblance of a plot. Even the actors have no idea what the movie is about (just read one of the interviews on line). This was a self-indulgent P.O.S. Save your time and just rewatch Twin Peaks.Also, I really have no idea why people are ranting and raving about Laura Dern's performance."
1,What about subtitles II?,"Why companies do this? what happen with them? There are millions of people who are native spanish in USAand could understand better with subtitles. The cost to add subtitles is nothing, why do this? Just French subtitles? Why? This is discrimination, and I hate it because I can't wait anymore to show the new Lynch's film. And I have to wait more time, much more."
1,Avoid at all cost,"This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my life. We had a chance to see it with my wife during the premiere screening in Europe. The viewers at such events, who are usually fond of ambitious movies were leaving in such numbers that we were afraid that no one would survive till the end."
2,"Jesus,this movie is hard to watch!",3 times I've watched this one & I can honestly say it's the only David Lynch movie that gets WORSE each time. SO BORING. 2 stars only because Lynch is still my favorite director of all time!
1,Big disapointment from a great filmmaker,"If you can imagine David Lynch making an 8 hour home movie to test out a cheap digital camera, then you've pretty much got Inland Empire. Really really long and rambling, without any of the sureal beauty of his other movies (many of which are fantastic). Fan or not, give this one a pass."
2,I'm just not sure of the point,"I am a big David Lynch Fan. I have all his movies, and I watch them frequently. This one however, I just could not grasp. I understand the dreamlike states he puts us in, but this one goes so far past that that even the most tuned-in fan has a hard time making sense of anything. I know making sense is not his intent, but this one was like watching channel changing for three hours straight.This movie, shot in video, seems like a very experimental picture. Some effects work and others don't. David Lynch says that ""He'll never go back to film"" after using digital video for this movie. I hope that he'll reconsider in the future. The purity of film in his hands is magical.On a positive note, Laura Dern proves that she is an amazing actress."
3,High Shipping Charges,"Product fine, just what I needed. Shipping charges very high so marked down for that."
1,disappointed,The only recognizable track is #1 Theme. and #3 Recumbent Love.Nothing else is familiar from both the B&W episodes and color episodes.PerhapsSilva Screen Productions can produce what we are waiting for.
4,remastered = degraded,"This is a great album, but be careful which version you get.I highly recommend buying the original ""Bring on the Night"" CDs (which I give 5 stars) instead of the remastered version (which is an import). You'll not only save yourself some money, but you'll be getting a higher fidelity recording.An audiophile might be more critical of the new version than me, but I sometimes found it hard to tell the difference between the two in sound quality. But when I did detect differences, the remastered version compared unfavorably. One instrument that really decided it for me were the cymbals. They sounded much more natural on the original CDs, while the remasters sounded like the digitized version.Like most remasters, this one plays louder than the original. But if I want louder music, I'd prefer to use the volume knob than sacrifice the quality of the recording."
5,Awesome contemporary Christian Music!,My 2 teenagers love this band's hard-rock music style with lyrics that address many of today's teen issues. FireFlight has also become one of my favorite groups because of their clean sound and razor-edged harmonies. I highly recommend this music to anyone searching for a contemporary Christian rock sound with a solid message.
5,Good Timing,I got the book the day before my first homework assignment was due. The book was sent two days after I purchased it and arrived in timely fashion. The book was in very good condition!
5,Good brain food! Fun!,"This review is a combination of opinions: mine and those of my 8-year-old.These DVDs rock! We now know to bring a big plastic sheet with us in the desert, and how to get drinking water from condensation. (Although, we have yet to test it.)We have been inspired to combine cornstarch and water for a fun ""non-Newtonian fluid."" And, Alex is definitely learning - the other day, he started talking about ""non-Newtonian fluids"" even though he hasn't seen that episode for at least a month.Very interesting. For example, learning physics through juggling lessons (hopefully we'll put that one into practice soon!)This DVD set, while I have watched only a few episodes, appears to be without violence, so we let our 3-year-old watch as well. He is just as entertained as our 8-year-old.Also, five stars for no gratuitous use of junk food, unlike Bill Nye and so many other brainy shows. There is nothing in this series to irritate atheists nor libertarians."
3,A Bit of a Disapointment,"I first heard Dar's music while I was working in Maine this summer and fell in love with ""What I hear in these Sounds"". I would still recomend buying this CD for that song, and a few others. However, the mastery of Williams is her pure folk music. She ""hides"" behind drums and electric guitar in this CD. What makes Dar great is caputred on this CD, but not as well as on her others. Get them first."
4,Music Survey Course Text - heavy on analysis,"The Way of Music is one of your typical music history survey course text books. I've picked up a number of them over the years, tossing many, but Brandt's is useful for his analytical charts. He is rather heavy on musical analysis, which I enjoy."
3,cute but a lil small,"Beautiful shoe, well made. It almost fit but I was not able to get the zipper to close =( Beautiful otherwise. Returned it sadly."
4,Awesome!,I loved the look of this shoe and was so excited to find it! They look beautiful on your feet and I can't wait to show them off at my wedding! They will def. be a highlight that are shown off to as many friends as possible!
4,Cheap and effective,"I fixed my crooked stove, and crooked dresser and wardrobe and have plently left to level the foundation of my house."
4,"Beware the ""free shipping"" claim...","I love this product (10lbs whey isolate protein powder, unflavored) and I'd like to reorder it, however I noticed it says ""free shipping"" on the main page, but when I go to checkout it keeps adding $27 for shipping charges...I don't know if it's a glitch, but it sure doesn't feel good to be mislead like that.Just want to give a heads-up, since you can already get the product cheaper elsewhere online (LP Supplements or All Star Health.com). I'm writing this review in Sept of 2012 -- the listed price on amazon is $97 with ""free shipping"" of $27; I'm going to order it elsewhere for a total of $85-$90 (including legitimate, posted shipping costs)."
1,Hard on my stomach!,"Well, i am going to make a comparison review here. I had been using ON's natural whey product without the fake sweeteners for a couple of years and it is by far the best protein powder I have ever tried. But I was afraid I was going to burn out on it so thought I would give this one a try. That was a huge error. First I do like the idea of not a lot of crap I don't need, like artificial sweeteners and preservatives. But this stuff tore my stomach up. It foams really bad in the blender. It turns a 12oz shake into a 24oz shake. I can only handle a half scoop or my stomach is in knots. ON's whey doesn't do this and if I want I can take 2 or 3 scoops of that. I tried it with water, soy, milk, fruit juice, chocolate syrup, peanut butter, frozen fruit, banana, honey.... you name it. I just cant make it work. So now I am ordering some Optimum Nutrition Natural chocolate from now on and throwing this stuff out!"
3,Bummed out,"Man I'm so sad with this product. I was so happy to try it out, and after 3 servings I can't take it anymore. It gives me thee WORST GAS ever! It's just so sad and horrible. I can't even use it :( Besides that, it takes pretty much like nothing. I mixed it with lite almond milk, stevia, frozen blueberries and raspberries and it was yummy."
3,One Time Buy,It's probably as good a whey supplements as any but i won't buy it again because.1. it has a plain flavor that tastes like instant milk which i just don't care for.plus that makes it a negative placebo effect because the flavor relationship to cheap instant milk powder creates that subtle thought that maybe i'm being ripped off.2.i don't think it mixes nearly as well as Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey which is what i usually buy.3. i don't like the scoop that comes with it. it's too big to take out a full serving and transfer to the glass i use without usually spilling a little. so i do it a half scoop at a time.i just tried the Now to take a break from years of using Optimum Nutrition flavors. breaks over.i'll end on a positive for the Now Whey. no negative physical side effects. i have tried some brands that caused me lots of digestive distress. i had no problem with Now Whey.
4,It's good and almost taste-less,"This product is not completely taste-less, but is not bad, at least in my opinion. I love the fact that the ingredients are plain old, simple whey. For me it's perfect, but if you're really picky on tastes, then this may not be the best option...especially if you just mix with water. I will continue to purchase this brand because it does mix well and doesn't get clumpy and is priced very reasonably."
5,Clean,"One of the best proteins i have ever tried..Very clean and you can mix with anything, even grape juice...doesn't make your beverage of choice thicker..I lov,e this stuff"
1,"Sure it's protein, but this tastes terrible in everything","I don't understand how anyone cannot be disgusted with this product. It is not delicious, it is not good, it's not ok, it's not even bad, it's terrible. I've tried mixing it with several things, and they're all made more terrible by the taste. I recommend Syntha-6, that stuff is delicious. Trying this out because I generally like NOW products was a mistake, I don't think I'm going to be able to finish this powder, I'm going to have to pawn it off on someone as a gift or something. Not good."
2,Proteins or Calories?,"Amazingly I gained two sizes in 10 days and gained 8 pounds of weight, I was losing weight working very hard everything was going fine till someone advised me to have proteins in the morning; I found this and screwed up all my hard work from last six months. Don't know what to do... Who tests as what is printed on the box is true or not..."
3,so-so,"Part II is somewhat useful, while Part I is somewhat useless. The conjugation guides and examples, pp 84-97, are handy even though not in a tabular layout. The written exercises in Part II are productive time-killers on long flights and layovers, but not contextually relevant. Better to look at this book after you already have some conversational Tagalog experience."
1,Item not as pictured,Warning....do not order this product from this seller (Housewares). The item sent to you will not be the item that is pictured. You will be sent a roller set with 8 jumbo and 4 super jumbo rollers (the same product you can buy for 24.95 from the Amazon site and get free shipping)so you will end up paying about $5.00 more for the rollers plus shipping costs if you order from this seller....and then you will have to pay shipping again if you want to fool with returning the product sent to you even though it was the seller's error.
4,Nice one !,I bought this couple of weeks back and it is just great.Pretty good access speed is the highlight.I would rate it atleast 4 out of 5.
1,Really Amazon?!?!?,"I am shocked that this product is in the 5-7yr old toy section. Seriously?!?!? I have always let my child come on this site to check out toys and show me what she'd like for Christmas or her birthday, so that I can read reviews and decide, but if you are going to try to sell this type of product to my YOUNG child, I think we will start shopping other places for toys. Very disappointed that such a successful company would use this type of tactic to get people to buy products."
1,This was item #95 for toys for 5-7 year old kids??? Not appropriate! Bad Amazon!,"I could not believe this item was listed as the 95th item for toys for 5 to 7 year old children. I contacted Amazon's customer service line, and Queen told me she could not do anything until a review was written on this project. Seriously, I cannot believe a company like Amazon is promoting smoking to young children. And I could not believe that the customer service representatives did not care enough to look into this situation.Amazon, you should be ashamed of this. I have been an Amazon customer for several years, but now I am embarrassed to use this site. I have shared the link showing this toy as a recommended toy for 5 o 7 year old kids with my friends on facebook and I have sent this information to CNN and Fox News."
2,ehhh.,"Pros:Looks Realistic, feels realistic, and cheap. That's about it.Cons:When you blow only a small amount of 'smoke' is seen. And if you puff back to back 'smoke' won't come out. You'll have to wait a while to puff again to see a small amount of 'smoke'. Doesn't last long.Wish that more 'smoke' would come out in order to really fool your friends or to have fun!! But you really do get what you paid for."
4,worked like a charm!,"This pack of 2 fake cigarettes exceeded my expectations! I used them for a costume party and they looked incredibly realistic, with the smoke coming out of the end and the red shimmer to make them look like they glow. I used them for several hours (not continuously) and there is still more ""smoke"" to go! My dad borrowed one for a bit and his friends thought it was real... well worth the cheap price for a few laughs :)However - they are fragile, so be careful with them. I knocked some of the powder off the end and it didn't look quite so realistic anymore."
5,I love it,My friends thought that i started smoking ....i really got them fool....This product looks like a real cigarettes and smoke does come out.
1,Sucks,Its lame its just powder in paper you cant suck only blows its useless.. I don't recommend to anyone. waste of money
3,Eh...,I choose to give the rating of 3 stars because of the packaging. They two puffs came in what looks like wax paper ..they were just thrown in the envelope..
2,OK but....,"Most of the time, LineForm does what it promises to do, but it has serious flaws, such as crashing when first asked to print a file (but not on subsequent tries). The biggest drawback is that the app is no longer supported and, thus, in an upgrade limbo. Had I known that when I ordered it, I would have looked for another piece of software. As it turns out, there are very similar (almost identical) apps available at a much lower cost, such as Graphics Design Studio. That program will do everything LineForm does (without crashing, and at a price of $4.99 (at Apple's Apps Store) as opposed to what I paid for LineForm at Amazon: $72.99!."
5,Snorting Good Read,"Rarely do I laugh out loud as I read a book on a crowded NYC subway. In fact, I thought only David Sedaris could make that happen, until Elizabeth Warner came on the scene. ""Ditched"" is about two worlds colliding: the last gasp of Main-Line Old-School traditionalism meets the reality of the modern urban world. But it's the way it's written that really sucked me in: ""To my right two elfin girls in baby-doll tees and jeans so petite they appeared to be conducting a rape in progress...."" and ""... impossibly appealing men with that ruddy, Northeastern skin that wants to shout 'sun' and 'tropics' but really whispers 'gin.'"" See? Funny!"
3,Trying too hard,"This was an amusing, not hysterical read. Too many times I found myself thinking, ""I know this part is _supposed_ to be funny..."" without actually laughing. And the footnotes were more annoying than not and could easily have been incorporated into the text of this memoir-not-thesis. Another frustration was the Streisand chapter that was completely blacked out for comic effect (or something). For someone who makes his living writing humor, I was disappointed."
5,Katz Brings the Funny,"""Clinton and Me"" is the book for you if you're looking for something funnier and less mean than the collected works of Al Franken.If you love politics and humor, Mark Katz's book is for you. He takes you on the wise-ass world tour, from the principal's office to the Dukakis campaign office to the Oval Office all in one fell highly entertaining swoop.Part political memoir, part Sedaris, part ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,"" but, most importantly, all funny."
5,Best Box Set Yet!!!!!!!!,"Finally, it has come out. The Simpsons fourth season dvd box set is the greatest of them all so far. It contains in my opinion the best season of the simpsons overall, including one of my favorite sayings from God,"" Nine out of ten religions fail the first year."" Stepping away from the episodes themselves, this box set has the most extras including Sketches, multi- angle features and much more. I was scared to open it when I got because I was sure it was going to explode with extras because it is just that jampacked. If you only have enough money to get one of the box sets this is the one. The only thing bad I have to say bad about this box set is that the box itself seems to me to be a little bit busy. That's just me being picky though. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have so far."
5,The Simpsons - Complete Forth Season,Great service. Received in excellent condition and faster than expected. Very entertaining. Will provide family with many laughs for years to come! Would definitely order from them again!
3,When will I see you smile again?,This season is pretty good. Conan O'brien produces some of the episodes and shows everyone he has true gritt. If you're a real Prince and The Revolution fan this is the season for you!
5,The Simpsons do it again.,"Why should you get this dvd box set? The question your really looking for is why shouldn't you buy it?? If you are a simpsons fan then in no doubt you will have pre-ordered this magnificent dvd....The Simpsons Complete Fourth Season is when the Simpsons really started to look their ""finest"" Also the sound is extra sharp, and the writing even better. The third seasonis one of the best dvds ever created...then this is probably the one best dvd box set ever created, bar none. The only gripe I have about this is that Fox is currently releasing one season a year...in my opinion that is insane, by the time they get the 15th season on dvd, there will be something better then dvd, and people will not use it....Remember Fox, Technology comes a long way in a short time...Anyway if you are a Simpsons fan or not, this is a requirement to add to your dvd collection.... 5 stars"
4,Not all the songs are techno,"Sultana (Keman Solo)and Üsküdar (Trompet Solo)Are beatiful songs that can dance in a very dramatic way.I am happy with this CD, nice music"
4,A Puritan Warrior in strange African lands...,"This a collection of all Robert E. Howard's writings using the character Soloman Kane, a Puritan warrior who is driven by conflicting urges of vengeance and chivalry amidst supernatural foes. Most tales take place in Africa, where allied with a mysterious ju-ju man he has strange adventures, battling ancient races and ancient evils in his quest to deal out justice.These stories are very good on the whole. There area few poor tales by Howard's standards, and the one with a vampiric queen is a big let-down considering its potential. But there are a few classics - such as 'Wings in the Night', a superbly-drawn story with excellent characterisation and narrative action. The personage of Soloman Kane is very interesting and truly three-dimensional. Just a shame that Robert E. Howard didn't get to use him more often in his writings."
4,"30 years later, I like it even more.","I first read this book in high school, and I loved it. It has a lot of qualities that would appeal to a 16 year old girl, especially the introduction to a man's viewpoint of women. But as I reread it nearly thirty years later, I found the descriptive, eloquent writing so evocative I related to the book on a whole new level. There is an element of predictability, but it's totally enjoyable."
3,"A more apt title would have been "" Pour no More""","A better at least a more "" indicated"" title for a late Roark would have been "" Pour no more"""
5,good product,this is a nice quality card holder at a good price and is just what I was looking for. I am very happy with my purchase
5,Very Nice,"Seems to be very well made and very nice looking. Nice soft smooth leather. The shipping turned out perfect, ordered it Tuesday night and received it Thursday morning Fed X at my door. Since this was a gift that's about all I can say. But for a Woman that is looking for something rather thin and flat for credit cards to go in a purse along with a wallet this seems to be perfect.No dislikes, I'm going to order one for myself."
4,value for money,Buying from Amazon at such a low price definitley makes this swiss watch value for money
2,Over-priced...,Nice little book with some wonderful photos but in my opinion it's over-priced for what it is. Could do better for the price.
2,wrong,"wrong decals... wrong size... wrong design... not made to put on anything but a perfevtly flat surface. Would say they suck, but the small Harley shields where useful"
5,Wonderful ending to a fantastic series!,"I just finished this today on the subway, and I must say, it was a great read. While I might have a quibble here and there, on the whole, she delivered with her tale.Her world breathes in a way Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind can't come close to. She deftly handles a large cast of characters, giving each their turn on the stage. Of all the characters, perhaps Keffria and Serilla left me the least satisfied, but that is one of my quibbles.Hobb has rapidly ascended to the highest ranks of fantasy authors, which are few in my opinion. She, George Martin, Guy Gavriel Kay, Charles De Lint and Glen Cook (Black Company) are the best today. Jordan lost it long ago, and Goodkind is a simple hack who can't find his way around a story point.Read this book - you won't regret it."
4,Excellent,I loved this series. The only thing that could have made it better is if I would've read it in between the Farseer and Tawny Man series. I goofed and read the Tawny Man immediately after Farseer. I love Robin Hobb's work.
3,"Even if your rape, murder and lie you can still be a hero","** Major Spoilers **Well lets get straight to it: I read the whole series in a few days, hardly putting down the books and spending all my days to devour the pages. So yes the book is gripping as few others the wolrd building and the story are great.But i feel cheated at the end. I really considered stop reading when Kennits tale was finished. I get it, he was abused as boy and not capable of loving someone. But that didn't made me hate him less. In the whole series he was busy with deceiving, murder and in the last part rape. So how does it works out for him? He is recognized as pirate king, liked and respected by everyone and dies in the hand of his family live ship which loves and becomes one with him. And he has an heir. I would actually prefer this to Athelas ending beeing parted from her ship.Do i need a happy ending in fantasy books? Maybe, i'm not sure. But what i'm sure i hate is a happy ending for those characters i despise."
2,Divine Disappointment,"It could have been great, the concept was there, but the story was so heavy and the charachters so flat, you didn't feel anything for them and honestly, didn't care if they worked out their attraction to each other. It was soooo slow, and the sex scenes so contrived it was difficult to get through. I love an erotic story with plot, and have read and thoroughly enjoyed other Ashbliss titles but this fell flat. I say don't bother."
5,Excellent guide for home building,"This book has so much information in a very straight forward approach. Very easy to follow, step by step guide through the home building process. It felt like the author was sitting with me discussing my project."
5,all-encompassing must have book,"I found this book to be extremely comprehensive and easy to read. The author did a great job on organization and flow and I would recommend this book to anyone intersted in building their own home, or even just purchasing a new build."
3,Okay but not the best out there,The book covered all the basic topics but it was very simple. It did not offer me any real advice but simply an overview of the college experience. The book was ugly to read and too simple. If someone has absolutely no idea what to expect in college then this book is a good start but otherwise people should shop for something else. I don't think it worth too much of anyones time or money.
1,waste of time,"I guess this is a good all in one guide, but if you've been looking at various sources for college advice, i.e. online, there's probably nothing in here you don't know. Flip through it at the bookstore, then leave it there. Instead, read the cal newport study books. now there's some useful stuff."
2,Disappointing,"There are VERY few books on this topic to be found, so I was optimistic when I ordered it. Alas, it does not live up to its promise. I plan to keep the book because every chapter contains a few nuggets of useful information, but it is not worth the purchase price. The level of discourse is suitable for advanced high school students, and the prose style is pallid and lifeless. I found very little science in the book, despite its title. I was hoping for solid economic and demographic analyses, and found none. The social and cultural material is better, but not strong enough. Most of the authors are aware of the size of the epidemic, but in my opinion do not yet appreciate the depth of the catastrophe that is impending. No author addresses the likely effects that AIDS will have on African nations in the future (this may be the fault of the editor, not the authors). To summarize, they missed a golden opportunity."
1,"Cheap Metals, NOT Sterling Silver","I received this product as a gift and within days the ""silver"" coating wore off exposing cheap metals, which ended up infecting my ear. Originally these were intended to be used as a nose stud (as the description claims they can be used as) which is not true at all. Nose studs DO NOT have an earring back. Trying to wear this as a nose stud is painful and unsanitary. This product is NOT made of sterling silver. Avoid this product if cheap metals irritate your skin!"
1,Carol,"These controllers are junk. Would not recommend wasting your money on them.had them just a few weeks and the joy stick is stuck on both of them. Our grandson loved them, he's a big superman fan. I bought a Nintendo brand controller to replace them."
4,Enjoyable Kindle mystery novel set in Key West.,"Before going to Key West last week,I had asked at the Amazon Kindle forum for suggestions for books set in Key West. I received a number of recommendations, including Corcoran's series which is set right there. This was the best book in those suggestions.Alex Rutledge is a part-time crime photographer who, at the beginning of this novel is mugged and propositioned (for a job). All of this launches a mystery with several murders, and a story that goes back 20+ years.This was a VERY enjoyable novel(my first by him) with a story that moved along, and several very enjoyable characters who I look forward to following again (There are more books in this series). The mystery isn't that great, but rather an entertaining read well worth following.There are some formatting/typos in the Kindle edition. (""Mamie"" becomes ""Marnie"", ""Corner"" becomes ""comer"" are frequent examples.) Not enough to disrupt the story flow, but they should have been corrected."
3,"Like the show, hate this compilation","I wonder if the people who made this compilation set ever saw this show. I have watched a lot of Step by Step episodes before, and the six episodes they choose are definitely not my favorites. 6 episodes for for $12, ripoff if you ask me."
2,Step by Step,"The product is exactly what I thought it would be, funny and a blast from the past. I'm happy with it."
1,Cheaper elsewhere,I just bought this brand new at Target for $4.75. I can't believe these people are asking such ridiculous prices.
3,trip down memory lane,"this has a good mix of old and new episodes on it for people who are not looking for the full season, but still want to remember the good ol days when TGIF was on."
3,We want the whole enchilada,"The DVD's got some good shows in it... but it's too little for us, fans of the show. Let's get the whole series on DVD now!!!"
5,This is the most important text on fatherhood available.,"this is a wonderful text, a tour-de-force about the power and trouble of intimacy, love and vulnerability. these narratives, collected from black men, are poignant and moving - particularly the last essay. i recommend this profound text to those who are in the least interested in good writing and at best in wisdom, faith and an examined life."
1,"Damn, This Movie SUCKED","Damn this movie sucked. Why? Lack of talent. Lack of a script. Lack of substance. Lack of intellect. Lack of having a point. Lack of creativity. Lack of acting. Lack of trying. And ultimately, at the end of the movie, it left me with a lack of giving; lack of giving a rat's ass about how it was going to end. At least Jessica Alba could have shown her knockas. Minus 3 stars for this slop."
1,90 minutes you'll want back,"I'm always a bit wary of Amazon reviews because I've gotten some bad ones in the past. This one tops them all in the ""what were you thinking"" category.The fact that this movie has a 4 star rating all but makes it impossible to trust the masses. This movie is so painfully, painfully, awful. I feel sorry for anyone who subjected themselves, as I did, to this joke. If I can sway one person from going through the same torture I did maybe it will be worth taking the time to write this.This is the 1st review I've ever written, and I wouldn't normally take the time. In this case however, I have to make an exception and warn you about the danger of this thing, whatever you want to call it.Sure Jessica is gorgeous, and if you must rent this to look at her, just stare at the cover for awhile. DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE INSIDE THE CASE!!!!There... I've done my part. You have been thus warned. What you choose to do from here I cannot be held responsible for. Good luck."
2,Definitley not for everyone,"This film is definitley not for everyone. Personally, i didnt like it because i dont like hiphop. I found it boring and unrealistic. Though i suppose some people must like it if its been given an overall review of 3.6 stars."
1,This is not Hip-Hop,This movie was not about hip-hop. Don't believe the hype. Jessica was nice to look at but the dancing was weak. Lil Romeo can not and I reapeat can not dance. If he was to come to the streets with that wack little shoulder move he would get kicked off the block. But he's just a kid you might say... so what! Rent a copy of the freshest kids if you want to see what some kids called the Rocksteady Crew did when they we're just kids and you'll see what I mean when I say his moves were garbage.Secondly the script sucked and plot was ripped straight out of breakin' 2 electric bugaloo with a pinch of flashdance.P.S. You can't learn HipHop either its in you or it ain't
2,Positive but it could be better,"I have to admit. This movie's all about Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba). She's hot with a cool attitutde and she can dance. Watching the movie, I really liked the the plot. All the dance moves were tight, the themes were inspiring, and the soundtrack was BOOMING. This could have been a classic. But really now...if you're going to make a movie based on real life struggles within lower classed communities, the acting must be right. Apart, from Lil Romeo and the supporting cast who were great throughout the movie, Alba just didn't fit in. The sore thumb in the film was obviously Alba's terrible acting (that somehow got overshadowed by her looks, and radiant smile). ""Honey"" is ok, but it's NOTHING compared to ""Empire""."
2,IF THIS IS the best ADO.NET book then GOD HELP US,"I gave this book 2 stars because of the VERY misleading title.(I also took the book back to the store)The book does not even come close to being an ADO.NET book. It states Learn How To interact with databases using the Connection, Command, DataReader, and DataAdapter Components and how to manipulate data with the dataset component.This is a JOKE. Chapter 2 Interacting With Databases is nothing more than a list of the objects mentioned above and their properties and methods. NOT EVEN AN EXAMPLE on how to properly use them.The book should have been named more for the interaction of ADO.NET and XML, because that is what most of the focus appears to be on.But what the book does cover is very well written !"
1,Damaged,"I really like the look of this bread bin, but the manufacturer does not package it in a box. It only has a clear plastic bag around it. Even though Amazon uses it's own box for shipping, it arrived with dents and cracks. Amazon quickly replaced it with another one, which had dents, cracks, and the entire bottom was was badly scratched. I don't have time to keep sending these back hoping to get a replacement which isn't damaged, so I gave up after returning the second one."
5,Stupendous!,"I first saw this group on the Andrew Lloyd Weber Special and fell in love with them right away! I pledged enough to get the video, then went out to buy the CD. I have played it over and over --- it's great! Everyone I play this CD for falls in love with this group also. I hope they become more popular in the U.S., I want to hear more from them. Keep it up guys!"
4,It's sound good,"This album makes me love this irih band. Normally i am not very interested in other boyz band but this one is different at least they will write up their songs by them- selves the best song i think will be No Matter What and i especially love the voice of Stephen Gately his voice just like a boy ( rather than a man ) its make his voice distinctive from the others but the worst things i can challenge on this album is that i find the agent who issue this album is really really dishonest cos i buy this album before the No matter what and i love the way you love me pup up into the album just after i 've buy the one version without these two songs, the new versions come up with these two new songs that's make me nut......"
5,EXCELLENT!,"I AM A FAN OF BOYZONES MUSIC, THIS ALBUM IS THEIR BEST EVER AND I HOPE THEY RELEASE IT IN AMERICA. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO BREAK INTO THE AMERICAN CHART BEFORE AND WITH MUSIC LIKE THIS IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THEY HAVEN'T YET DONE IT. THEIR CONCERTS ARE BETTER THAN EVER THEIR AUDIENCES HAVE GROWN AND THEIR SONGS ARE REACHING TO THE LIKES OF THE BEE GEES. RONAN'S VOICE IS STRONG, STEPHEN'S ANGELIC AND WELL DONE TO MIKEY'S BRILLIANT SOLO, GOOD CONVERSATION. A DEFINITE THUMBS UP FOR BOYZONE! I WISH THEM LUCK IN BREAKING AMERICA IN 1999!! BRILLIANT!"
5,Great easy listening,"I found Boyzone by accident on a concert on cable and then bought the CD after enjoying just 1 of their songs (the one from Notting Hill). I loved the CD from beginning to end and listened to it continuously for the better part of several months (much to the annoyance of my 2 kids). Yes, I'm not a teenybopper, but a 35 year old who very much enjoyed this CD & highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good harmony and enjoyable song structure & lyrics, without screaming and profanity."
5,A great CD! Boyzone's matured side...,"It is definitely the one of the greatest CDs I've ever bought. It really really speaks to the heart. It's very mature and their lyrics are oh so true. If you need to soften up and add some truth to your heart, this is the CD. It speaks of love, in times of happiness and times of heart aches. I must say, it is simply grand!"
5,I Can't Believe I Loved This CD,"For my brother's 39th birthday, I bought him this CD since hewanted the song, ""No Matter What,"" after hearing the song onPBS as part of the ALW Birthday, and this CD was less expensive thanWhistle Down the Wind. So, I figured what the heck, I'll get one for myself while I am at it. What a shocking discovery! I liked all the songs on the CD. There wasn't a single clunker to me, but ""No Matter What"" and ""All That I Need"" ARE my favorites. Of course, my brother and his wife expect never to see the CD again-- they think their 12-year old daughter will abscond with it as soon as she hears it..."
3,Further clarification,"This album showcases professional-standard demos of songs by Nick Drake, John &/or Beverley Martin, Mike Heron and Ed Carter; they aren't ""Elton John tunes"" at all. The first seven tracks are sung by Reg Dwight/Elton John, the last four by Linda Peters (later Linda Thompson). It was produced by legend Joe Boyd, who used three of his Fairport/Fotheringay musicians: Pat Donaldson on bass, Gerry Conway on drums and Simon Nicol on guitar. Dwight/John plays piano throughout. It was recorded in July 1970, not 1968 as often claimed.The 1998 CD version of this album from Rarest Records (SCET1100014) is of pretty decent sound quality -- no pops and crackles that I can hear, though there is a little distortion in places.It's an interesting curio, though I would agree probably only for Elton John or Linda Thompson completists."
1,Acquired Taste,"John Paul Caponigro really is brilliant and his website is a wonderful resource, but he really is a difficult person to deal with and read. My Advanced Photoshop class used the first edition of his book, and I found it very difficult to read. His whole attitude is I am right and your all wrong, and Photoshop is such a large program that there are many ways to get things done. Yes, In Photoshop some ways might be faster and easier then others but it is the same way in real life, so do not feel obligated to follow his steps exactly.No, I have not read this edition of the book but I have read enough of his previous stuff to know his style of writing."
4,Good comment on the subject ...,"I purchased this book for more information on the subject of the antediluvian world before the flood and times shortly thereafter and I am not disappointed. I read several reviews stating that the book was difficult to read, but I disagree. What I think is that the subject matter for some may be difficult to follow because it is not something that is widely known or popular today. I will say that the particular way the author writes is unique and some may find his style a bit challenging, but otherwise his expertise and point of view are invaluable to anyone who wants or needs to enrich their understanding of the subject matter. One point, the author uses a lot of words to embellish his writing. I found it somewhat unnecessary, (hence the difficulty) but still got the essence of what he was saying. Overall, I'd have to recommend this book as a valuable source on the subject."
1,Did Not Work,"Purchased this item on Dec 2, 2009. Set it up for use on Dec 7. Printed blank pages. Reinstalled software, cleaned carttridges, no go. Very disappointed. This printer was able to print absolutely nothing. Will be sending back to Amazon as soon as I get home from school."
1,"Uggh, No More Epsons for Me","This printer worked great with OS X without any of the hassles my previous HP printers had with it, and in all other ways it was great.And then one day there was a paper jam.Just one paper jam.And just that paper jam caused the print heads to come out and under them was some kind of spring mechanism I couldn't figure out or fix and I just threw the damned thing away.If it's that fragile it's not worth spending even half the price on. Buy something else."
5,Very good printer,This is a very nice printer for the money you pay. Good photo printing. I am very happy with it.
1,Goes to hell after about 8 months,"I've had two of these printers. They both have the same problem, though the first one lasted longer than the one I have now before the print quality disintegrated. I've had this one just over a year, and for the last several months no matter how many head cleanings I do in a row before trying to print, it is impossible to get a clean page. I have been doing heavy printing today and cleaned before I started, again in the middle, and finally got decent black printing ... and then color printing went wonky and all the blue came out red. I've just cleaned it three times in a row and the test pattern still has not only gaps but up and down spits. The only reason I'm still hanging onto it is that I have a lot of ink left and don't want to waste that expensive purchase. Oh, and I have only ever used Epson cartridges in it - never an off-brand. Avoid this printer like the plague!"
1,Very disappointing,"I purchased an Epson Printer, the C86 model when I bought my computer, 3+ years ago. It worked fine for a short time, then I started to notice broken, faded and white lines through everything. I couldn't print a picture without lines all through it. I cleaned the heads regularly, purchased only the Epson brand ink and did everything else I was supposed to. I contacted Epson and they sent me a new printer, not even requiring that I send back the defective one, which really told me something about the product! The one they sent is the C88 model. It worked better, and for a longer time than the first one, but after several months it started doing the same thing as the C86 model. As has been stated by others, the ink is VERY expensive, and these printers use a whole lot of it. It was actually less than $10 more for me to purchase a new printer (HP, with scanner and copier) than it was to buy just the ink for the Epson.I am staying far, far away from Epson printers."
5,Great Job for a low cost printer,Excellen color reproduction. Very good with photos. Reasonably fast. Well worth the investment.
2,"I owned a C82, a C86, then I did not want the C88+","They do work really great, these Epsons. I know it because I owned two. For 1.5 years each. Read the reviews of the C82 and C86. The early reviews are all great, the ones that are added after 1.5 years all have one star. Something to think about. I got an HP deskjet now. Where the print heads are not part of the printer but part of the ink cartridge. A new printhead every time you get a new cartridge. Anyway. Enjoy your product as long as it lasts..."
2,Ink Hog,"I'vwe used epson printers from day one with no complaints until I purchased The C120, Yes it loves ink, and the cartridges are not that cheap for this printer, I have used remanufactured ink cartridges in all of my other Epson Printers with no problems but with this printer it's all problems unless you use the epson Cartridges. I Have notice that the print quality does very a lot, sometimes very good, sometimes not so good even when printing the same picture, So do yourself a favor and shop around before you purchase this printer and before purchasing any printer check on the cost of replacement cartridges"
1,Very disappointing,"I have always been a big Epson fan. However, I have been extremely disappointed with this printer. First of all, it burns through ink cartridges, which gets expensive. Secondly, I am constantly having to clean the nozzle heads to prevent gaps (which uses even more ink) so that the text on my documents is legible. It's so bad I have to clean them before almost every print job, and even then I rarely get a page to print out cleanly. Also, the printer has major problems with the paper feed - mostly when trying to print double-sided. After *every* page I have to push the paper feed button. Very annoying for large documents. Finally, when printing photos or anything that has a lot of ink coverage the colors are terrible. It's been so frustrating I am thinking of forking over for a laser printer. Avoid buying this printer!"
4,Epson Print Quality Versus Dependability,"We've been using Epson printers for over 15 years, having been very disappointed with HP and various other manufacturers. Even these inexpensive Epsons provide spectacular print quality. Photo printing results are no less than excellent. That's Epson's ""Pro"".The ""Cons"" are many: Expensive ink cartridges in relation to how much ink you get. (Kodak leads the market for best value, if not best print results.) The printer DOES require cleaning on a regular basis, which sucks up the expensive ink. During relative normal use, this printer is probably going to last as long as any of our previous six Epson printers -- about two-to-three years. Eventually, head cleaning and alignment no longer can resolve banding issues. I imagine that if your able to take the print heads out and clean them manually, that would probably extend the life of this printer...but that's beyond my capabilities.Excellent Print quality...for a limited life span."
3,"It's a good printer, but overengineered with little reliability",It prints good quality at rather slow speed. This is my 2nd printer as the useful life of printer head was done less than 2 years. It's overengineered for printer head and functions which hurt reliability.
1,Not Good,"This printer is good for one year only thus be ready to purchase another one exactly one year from the date of purchase. About one month before the the year of purchase gives a message that internal parts need maintenance to call manufacturer for service, the part needed to be replace $150.00 plus shipping and handling if you buy a new printer $90.00 free shipping. I have purchase three of this printers in the last three years due to the printing I do ""edible pictures"" and the supplier of the edible ink does not support any cartdriges other than cannon and epson. Lines are always showing in the printing and have to be cleaning the heads every other page. Buy it only if you must..!!Good luck."
1,Don't EVER by Epson printers - they ROB you on ink,This is the third Epson printer I bought (I bought 2 at one time).They CONSISTENTLY BURN through ink. They use a 'chip' that tells the printer the cartridge is out of ink when it is half full! There is nothing you can do to make it work after that!They are also programmed to reject generic ink.Their cartridges are ridiculously expensive!Check out the class action suit against Epson.DO NOT BUY - UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE MONEY ON THEIR PROPRIETARY INK CARTRIDGES
4,Please take the girl!,"When I bought this album I had no idea that it was Cledus' debut. I'd heard Just Another Day in Parodies at a friend's house and was hoping for something similar. I was a little disappointed but I still found the album to be well worth it. In fact the only song I didn't quite feel was Swingin'. I mean he went from country to cra---ahem, rap, with pretty much no warning. Possibly my absolute favorites on the album are Indian In-laws (if my girlfriend's parents are anything like the ones in the song she can forget about the wedding), Please Take the Girl (I never cared for the Tim McGraw original), and Motel Californy, which is just---well---hillarious! Shade Tree Mechanic is also a song I listen to quite regularly. In short, this is a great first album for Cledus."
2,mens sherpa lined hooded sweatshirt,My husband loved the thought of the sweatshirt and the quality seemed great. Except when he put it on the whole inside seam of the left sleeve was ripped half way around the arm hole??I will sew it myself since I know there will be a shipping fee but was very disappointed that a new sweatshirt would come out of a package this way. I will never order clothes on line for this reason again.
1,It Looks Cheap,"It was inexpensive and it looks cheap. Upon examination, it was not made cheaply. The silver is solid, the stones are bead set and it is bordered with milgrain(little sterling beads around the edge of the pendant). The problem--whoever designed this piece flattened the surface so much so that it looks almost concave. It makes the pendant appear really thin and flimsy, when it actually isn't, because the surface is so flat, it appears that someone took a beautiful Star of David and glued on some black glitter. It has no depth. The reverse side of this pendant is solid silver and it actually looks better. I don't like this piece of jewelry, but I won't go through the hassle of sending it back. I previously purchase some lovely marcasite earrings from another company, I would definitely not wear this pendant with my earrings. It is a disappointment, because I purchased this pendant to go along with my earrings. I also love the Star of David and this is a poor representation."
3,Overall a good tank,"OK, I thought this was kind of overpriced, but I checked it out for a few minutes and decided to buy. NAO actually drove it to my house within a week. I got the ""extra shiny"" option and the soap dispenser - I believe I chose wisely on both points.Main reason I got this tank was that my current fleet in a bit too bulky for civilian engagement. You can't quite sneak up on somebody in a decommissioned Russian Crater X4 without drawing a crowd.Initially I thought the Tecumseh 6 would be a bit of a Sally, but I provided the recommended premium 96 and it fired up like a stoked pig. Black smoke poured out and around and in the caib. It was quite exhilarating and noxious all the same. I recommend wearing some type of breathing apparatus.Whatever, I love this sick monkey. I stopped driving all of my war vehicles all together in favor of this one. Be sure and put a cover over this thing because it will freak your neighbors. This thing is money."
2,"Oh, you were joking. Boy do I feel dumb.","Plenty of positive reviews yet my cruiser didn't work out that well. Then after reading them I realize that most of those reviewing (all?) are making fun...You see, living out west we have Burning Man, and with all the maintenance my cats require I just didn't have the time to build a neat vehicle this year. I figured this would be a hit. Actually, it went over well, but it didn't cruise reliably (crusties in the wheels), and if you don't charge it enough the stereo kills the batteries. And man could it use air conditioning. Wanted to add it, and more deep cycle batteries. I called in to Tom and Ray but they weren't too helpful, or funny, really. It's also hard to get off the trailer. Then it can get wheel sink in the soda flats, and (yawn.) G'night, going to bed now."
2,It's not a tank.,"My survivalist group was interested in using this as a safe personnel transporter to cross a dry lake bed from our fortress to the nearest town. We thought it would make a nice cheap alternative to ex army APC's, and that once it was flanked by a couple of APC's an protected by the Tank it would be a safe route for members arriving in town to transfer to the fort.Wrong. On our first run across the lakebed we attracted a lot of notice from the locals and a small convoy of idiots started to hound the convoy. I guess they gave a good simulation of what we might expect from rioters in a genuine survival situation. Anyway, a gang of beer swilling red-necks in a pickup swerved into the Donk and took it out.We had to tow it into the enclosure and now the kids just play in it. What a waste."
3,hmm...,"i've been told i should wait for the hybrid version. it's supposed to come with a private who can get out and push, nearly doubling the mpg!"
1,This is not the tank you're looking for,"I bought the Donk for my husband and myself, and I'm greatly disappointed. First, it's almost impossible to get a droid in the Donk, unless they're a bi-pedal model.Second, the slats on the Donk offer poor visibility. It's almost impossible to accurately hit a target when you only have a 10 degree viewing angle, and almost no ability to manuver your weapon from side to side. So much for sniping womp rats.The sound system was great, easily rivals the sound system at the local cantina. And the carpeting inside is nice, but it's not that great when you're tracking in sand.It's great for sightseeing or a casual cruiser, but as a tank, it lacking. And there's no onboard computer system, no built in weapons or defense systems. It doesn't even have auto pilot. This really wasn't the tank I was looking for, I could get a better deal from the jawas on a used Hutt barge."
2,Not as comfortable as I thought it would be,* Cup holder broke the first day.* No mount for child seat.* Got a major ding (shopping cart?) at the supermarket.Next time I buy a tank I'll spend a little more and avoid the entry level models.
5,Good tank,"This a good tank for expressing your political opinions. when election year comes around, you can drive into all those politcal conventions for the parties you dont like, if they don't let u in then u can always drive thru the wall. then u can drive up next to the stage, dont shoot or anything but point the gun thingy at the candidate u dont like. they might call the marines but since u didnt actually do anything illegal (unless u drove thru the wall) u can call the ACLU and theyll sue the marines for infringing on ur right to drive tanks into political conventions! the only problem is that if u dont live in texas they might not allow u to drive this alot but that doesnt really matter becuz r they REALLY going to pull over some1 in a tank?"
2,A contented Graham Parker a great album does not make.,"GP playing alone with his acoustic guitar in an intimate setting is a tremendous thing to experience live - the concert CD's ""Live Alone In America"" and ""Live In Japan"" if you have not had the opportunity. For a stripped-down acousticy GP disc, buy Struck By Lighting which blows 12 Haunted Episodes out of the water. One or two adequate songs, but it's just not that interesting overall."
5,Very Entertaining but Insubstantial,"This is a fun read, especially if you like non-linear narratives and multiple points of view. The setting, the sometimes-vicious world of comic book collecting, is appealing.The early part of the book poses many questions: Who is Wimbledon Green? What was in the Wilbur R. Webb collection? Why was the first auction cancelled? Where did Green's vast wealth come from? Does Green Ghost #1 exist? etc, etc.All these mysteries are entertaining, but they aren't developed very far. Most are either forgotten, or end with rather everyday solutions.The book changes gears midway with a lengthy chase story. It's well done, but doesn't seem to fit with the multiple voices / flashback style around it.The character of Wimbledon Green changes -- early on he seems a cold-blooded collector, but by the final story, he's much more sympathetic. This is one of the strongest parts of the book, because of its emotional content."
2,This book lacks bite!,"I bought this book to add to my reptile library and to use a reference. Before my trip to the jungles of Costa Rica, I thought I'd read up on some of the more onery snakes that I might encounter, such as the bushmaster and fer-de-lance. Not only were there no pictures or information on the bushmaster, it wasn't even listed in the index! As for the fer-de-lance, there was a single picture but no information. I have since read the entire book, and have found it to be extremely lacking in useful species-specific information. The chapter titled ""A Few Interesting Species"" is very short (about 30 pages), not to mention it excludes some fairly important species! For the beginning enthusiast who just wants a general overview, this would be a good place to start, but don't let your education stop here! The book's only redeeming qualities for me were some nice glossy photos and the anecdotes written by herpetologists with snake bite or near miss experiences."
3,Waiting for Book # 4,"Found out about 1 year ago that there was a sequel to Sooner or Later but my friend couldn't find her copy. Found out by looking on Amazon there were 2 sequels. I tried all over to locate Now or Never without having to buy it at a crazy price. Actually bought both sequels. I ended up buying Now or Never for a crazy price because I just wanted to read it. With the Characters being older they did seem alot different to me and I tried to identify them with the Movie and 1st two books but it was a bit hard. Why did it have to take a dark turn of events? I like that it ended with them trying to work things out and it left room for a sequel. I would really like to see a 4th book to finalize the whole story and this time more happy things not so melodramatic. I signed the online petition for this, hope it helps. Love the whole story of Michael and Jess. Want them to have the happy ending they deserve."
1,Do not buy this,"This Audio CD is garbage. It contains just nine random 5 minute segments of the book recorded in audio. It does not contain the entire book in audio. To make it worse, it was delivered with no packaging or supporting materials, it simply came inside a blank CD case, and the image on the CD itself was obviously printed using a home printer."
3,"Of all the books, this one is the weakest","I found this one to be the weakest of all the books by Ries and Trout. As Creative Director of AUDIN Web Design, it just didn't capture my interest like their other books. Don't get me wrong, I think these authors are geniuses and I love their books. This one just didn't do it for me; I think it was the warfare motif. I'm not a pacifist, but it just didn't work for me: Warfare as Marketing. The funny thing is that I actually bought this book twice: once ten years ago in paper back and then again in hardback more recently. That goes to show you how forgettable I thought this book was. If you are on a real tight budget, buy a different book by these authors."
3,Too skinny and a lame design,"I should not have purchased these. The poly carbonate are much better, especially in cold weather. These are a real pain. The fork would work well for pickles or something like that and the knife is almost useless. Plus the way they assemble is not very sturdy and the case is good for maybe ten uses. I could give them a 2, I suppose, but they are decent strength and they do serve a purpose. I got them before I learned about the poly carbonate ones and that is the best way to go. Plastic plates from Wal-Mart and plastic everything. Keeps it warm in the cold and your hands from freezing. Plus they are lighter."
1,Not available,"It's listed as In Stock, but it is not available from Amazon or from Camping Gear. The company no longer makes this item."
2,Rabbit is no Reidel,"I saw an ad for Rabbit comparing it to Reidel. It is no Reidel.Heavier than I expected, and larger than I expected."
1,glasses too big!,"Do not order these glasses! I ordered them after reading about them in Wine Spectator, well what they did not say was how big these glasses are!!! HUGE!! I pulled them out of the box and laughed, there is no way they would fit in my cabinets. Great idea (no lead glasses) but they need to be a bit smaller. I returned them and had to pay shipping as Amazon says it is not their fault that I do not like the item, something to keep in mind."
5,An excellent book for first time and experienced bread baker,"My wife and daughter have baked six different breads (several times each) from this book and in every case the breads have been outstanding. They as bakers and I as a consumer are more than thrilled. We also agree that the book is profusely illustrated (wish more cook books were done as well), and instructions are easy to follow."
5,A REASONABLE AND DEPENDABLE HANDBOOK,"This reasonably edited pocket guide was designed for two groups of 'Mac' learners: those who have limited time to invest on a more detailed textbook and those who simply need a handy mini reference.Either way, this edition of ""Mac OS X Pocket Guide"" fulfills its obligations. The book is very straightforward. No unnecessary detail will be found in it. In fact, this book is so compact and concise that an average reader can finish reading its entire chapters in less than three hours with full comprehension. Fast readers will accomplish that much earlier.This is the book to invest on, if your need includes a quick and reliable memory refresher. In a very short time, it will familiarize its reader with all the important issues about the new Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar software.It is a reasonable and dependable handbook which every 'Mac' stalwart should benefit from."
5,Great Concert!,Great Concert!Domingo is in fabulous form with wonderful contributions from all the artists - particularly the young Roberto Alagna. Wonderful selections and very enjoyable.
4,A great repository for references on software development,"This manual is more than simply a collection of maxims and homilies about software development. Although the bulk of the text is devoted to telling us things that we probably already know, its worth as a database of references almost eclipses the value of its own text. An invaluable bibliography, especially for students in this area."
5,Wonderful product for frizzy hair,"I have used this product for over two years. It takes all the frizz out and leaves my hair very manageable. I usually buy it from my hair salon but found it on the web for $5 less. Great seller, had the product within three days. Awesome. I will buy through this seller from now on."
1,THESE PEOPLE CHEAT THE CUSTUMER,"The price is for a brake hose with proportioning valve. Yet when they ship there was no proportioning valve, but i was charged for it.Tehey sent a replacement, but with thr same result, no proportioning valve, again, only the rubber hose was shipped in the box."
5,This book delivers more than is bargained for ..,"It's absolutely stupendous that Chinese erotic literature has been translated into English and published on this side of the Pacific....Those of you that may be looking for Virtorian erotica need not apply with this masterpiece since it is a very complicated story of a very complicated society rich with history tradition and taboos that are not even close to Western cuture ....And thats the beauty of this book ....I am also an avid fan of both Chinese and Japanese movies and videos and anyone that has seen these works must understand that you had better pay attention to whats happening on the screen otherwise you miss all the fun of it. This book is the same, appart from highly erotic scenes it is a wonderfull story with INCREDIBLE character development ......A must have book for the TRUE conossieur of erotic lit ...."
1,Horrible,"This is a horrible book to start out with. If you're new to the concepts in the book you will not learn much. If you're already knowledgeable in the topics covered it might be a decent reference, but to learn anything from...? Useless."
3,Circuits Book,I feel the text is a bit scattered. The message is sometimes drawn out and not as clear as it could be.
1,When University profs try to write engineering books...,"I've worked as an engineer in the real world for over 4 years and have a small library of science and engineering texts, including about half a dozen EE texts, all of which are superb. I've never seen anyone devote two full chapters to resistor networks, nearly 150 pages!! In the real world engineers DESIGN circuits, not spend all day reverse engineering resistive networks, pretending they don't know the difference between a battery and a resistor! We drew circuit loops in jr high, I think we can move on to linear designs in college. Like I said, engineers write good engineering texts, not university professors."
4,Electrical Engineering (4th ed) by Hambley,"This book is incredibly boring if you don't like electrical stuff like me, but it does have a great overview of topics and electrical applications that all other types of engineers can relate to. The chapters are laid out logically and they have easy beginner questions after every topic to ensure that you understand the material. This book is a perfect intro/refresher of the electric jazz we all need to know and even highlights the main equations, yay! All in all, well worth the money."
2,Not what I expected from Taylor Made,These boots went on tight like putting nylons on an Elephant and don't cover the entire top or bottom of the fender. After a couple of months they start riding up on the fender like undersized undies. Other fenders we have on board were fitted with canvas from our local marine upholstery shop more than more than 10 years. This is a better option.
1,AVOID THIS TOY IT IS TOXIC,"I have an English Bulldog puppy. In one evening the dog chewed bits and pieces off the tire portion of this toy. This led to an entire evening of vomiting, not once , not twice but over 10 times. It was awful, my poor puppy was in serious distress. This product should be taking off the market. It is most definitely toxic if ingested."
5,Joe Grushecky Rocks,"It's easy to make references to Bruce Springsteen. In fact, Joe is to Pittsburgh as Bruce is to Asbury Park (and Michael Stanley is to Cleveland, for that matter).If you don't have any Joe Grushecky, this is a good choice to be your first. It's the first one I ever bought, having heard him live at a Pirate game shortly after it was released.I now have every CD he has ever released, and all the LP's that haven't been reissued on CD - he's that good.He doesn't have the world's best singing voice (but neither do Bruce, Tom Petty, Bob Seger, or John Hiatt). But, if you like ""Heartland"" Rock at all - listen to this CD all the way through just once, and you'll be hooked."
3,These Batteries are not 1100mAh,The batteries I received were 730mAh not 1100mAh like the picture suggests... The larger capacity was the main reason I went with this deal. It still seems like an ok deal but it is misleading.
3,Batteries,"Glad to have a battery replacement for my camera. It will certainly come in handy, especially when we are out taking picture."
4,Hard SciFi at its original best!,"This newly released omnibus contains two full-length novels that have become so ubiquitous as to be part of our psyche.The City and The Stars made such an impression on me that I can remember exactly where I was when I read it for the very first time - seventh grade in Bright, California at one of the meanest junior highs I ever did attend. It was an escape, it was fantastical without being fantasy. It was hard science fiction, set in the future. At that age, I couldn't comprehend how far in the future but I knew it was a place I would have liked to see, doing things that Alvin did. Living that Grand Adventure with him!I would encourage anyone who hasn't read an early Arthur C. Clarke or knows of any young science fiction fans to buy this omnibus & introduce them to the universe of Arthur C. Clarke. He did write more than 2001: A Space Odyssey - you know!"
3,Useful to a marketing student,"I believe this book is worth reading for a marketing student. This book provides us with clear concept and many useful examples. It helps me to understand the theories much more easier. Actually, it is much easier to explain advertising by showing us different ads. For example, when talking about sign and symbol in advertising, it is great to show us that how sign and symbol used in different ads. Besides real life examples, this book can also make use of many flow charts or diagram to help exam the theories and the concept in IMC and advertising. These flow charts help me to under and remember the logic very easily. I have to say I learn a lot from this book."
3,An ok read,"This book was decent but predictable. It did not keep my attention very well, and in the end I found myself just reading it to get through it."
4,Entertaining and funny,"It takes lots for a book to make me laugh out loud, but this one did. Entertaining cast of characters, each hysterical in their own way. Kip the nephew has been raised in absentia watching movies for education and has a quote from a movie for every situation. Granny is, well, granny. Lassiter has a comeback for every comment and his wise mouth gets him in tons of trouble. This mystery was full of twists and turns and had lots of action. Highly recommended for all ages"
2,Forgettable Zep book,"Some scattered quotes and stories that are interesting, a few pics, but mostly a run of the mill bio and slight ego trip by the authors. As a real Zep-head, I wouldn't recommend this."
5,The Saga continues,"Mr. Harris wrote a very enjoyable book. It is written in such a way that you feel like you are there. The book is a combination of fact and fiction, in an attempt to connect Sir William Phip's to the unsolved question ""What is buried under Oak Island, Nova Scotia"". It will be interesting, once the Oak Island mystery is solved, to see just how close he was. Anyone interesting in the Oak Island mystery will enjoy this rendering."
2,Opera/Arias,"I like only two songs because they were from the Baroque, the others were just a waste, it started promising but it ends in disillusion."
3,Can't the plastic be a little stronger?,"I have frequently purchased this laundry detergent, but I have found that in three of the last four purchases, the plastic container has sprung a leak while perched on top of my washer/dryer with the unfortunate result of detergent dripping down below the dryer, and losing a significant amount of the detergent. Any one else having this problem? I like the detergent, but honestly, can't the plastic be a little stronger??"
2,extremely over-rated,This is the second of Elvis Cole novels(the other being The Monkeys Raincoat )that I have read. I get through a lot of private detective novels and neither of these 2 books would make my top 100. Stick to Dennis Lehane or Laurence Block.
5,A review of the audiobook,"While not as action-packed as ""The Last Detective"" (which follows ""Indigo Slam"" in the series, but I've not read a single one of them in order so why start now?), this is a strong book. Lots of smart comments, action and twists and turns, although the very last twist was so obvious that only the clinically brain dead couldn't see it coming. But, that didn't lessen the overall value of the book for me.The audiobook is read by David Stuart who captures the voice of Elvis Cole perfectly. The entire book lasts about 7 hours."
5,Awesome,My boys LOVE this book! It helps keeps the fear in the 'monster under the bed' down and more personable. :) I wish there were more books to this series. I love the circle time where the lil monsters were happy to be crushing down the buildings and the children stare in horror. HAHA
4,Worth the read,"It is a quick read, quick reference book...the natural way.Have the first edition and use it all the time, friends and family always ask me to look up ""remedies"" in there.Most work really well and the items are usually right in your pantry."
3,Common Sense,This book is filled with common sense tips and things that your mother told you. This book is more for a college student or someone moving on his/her own for the first time.
3,"worth a read, but disappointing","this is a good collection, consisting of many of howard's stories (some don't belong here). howard is always great at combat descriptions and describing man's instinct. the stories here are mostly inspired by things Howard has read. howard can't manage to create the stories as well as usually, also being very uninventive and unoriginal at times. some of the stories were only vaguely interesting. beyond the borders was a better collection"
2,Just not a good item,"I just don't like this item. Got it as a wedding gift and have hardly used it because it sucks, plain and simple. Don't buy. There are others out there that are better. NOT KitchenAid quality here!!!"
4,Brooklyns Best Lyrically,"Eardrum is vintage Kweli. He's at his sharpest lyrically. But this album has what ""The Beautiful Struggle"" was missing at times . . .HOT TRACKS! Kweli is putting CONTENT back in lyricism. Excellent!"
4,Kweli Is BACK!!,Kweli is BACKKK!!! And hallelujah to hip-hop..This one is vintage Kweli..I am so happy he got back to the business of hip-hop and left the Okayplayerhaters and other naysayers out of this one! He seems so much more at peace and back to the matter of hand...delivering the message..that is what he does best and the production is on point as well. If you happen to read this Kwe...Do it GREENE!!!! This one satisfies better than a Snickers! Peace to REAL HIP-HOP!!!!
4,Solid effort from Kweli even though he doesn't get the credit he deserves.,"This was a great album. A lot of people slept on this album but this is by far his strongest effort since ""Reflection Eternal"". Kweli has been plagued with mediocre production on his previous albums although his is definitely one of the greatest lyricists of today. This album has it all. Very well rounded. Dope beats, dope lyrics. What more can you ask for?La, La, Laaaa, La, La, La, La, La, La, Laaaaaaa."
4,Between history and legend,"In the XIX century many western painters tried to describe the ""lost world"" of harems and sultanian courts. But those paintings were only imagination, because generally the westerns were not allouded to enter in those places. Instead, these ""Memoirs"" are a genuine source for having an idea of an islamic court of the XIX century. Furthermore the unicity of this book is due to the fact that it is written by a woman, the daughter of the Sultan Said bin Sultan of Oman, who escaped away from Zanzibar with a german trader and married him. The diary of Salme Reute was published many times and in different places. The edition by E. Van Donzel is more accurate and annotated than others. In it we find old photographs and other written materials on Zanzibar and Salme collected by the editor in different european archives."
4,Really neat!,This is a really great book for explaining the basics of the abacus (soroban). It comes with an actual abacus so you can start practicing using it. This is a must if you a person who really loves Math... Plus it is really fun to use!
1,The Abacus: The World's First Computer System + Abacus,The text is poorly written and too much text is spent on explaining ancient counting devices and very little text explaining the abacus. The amount of time spent explaining the use of the abacus itself could be considered an 'epilogue' in back of the book and is completely in error with very poor examples for its operation. It is a shame that this book is still on the market. I do NOT recommend this paperback in spite of the free -- somewhat small -- abacus.
2,Great for Insomniacs,"There are some books about the women of the old west that are far more interesting. The one overwhelming impression I had from this book is how uncaring her family was and how she herself really was a very selfish woman, even wanting to go to a dance the night her child was deathly ill. I would recommend other books such as Doc Susie: The True Story of a Country Physician in the Colorado Rockies and also Tomboy Bride. Both of these books are about intellegent, caring individuals in the same parts of the country and in the same time."
4,The DVD was made just for Dumbbells use.,"I was pleased to find out,that this dvd was make for dumbbells use. Some of the other excercise video's had other excercise's in it,it was a very good,they explained about stretching before and after you do your work out,and it works better if you work out while you are watching the video. I am Glad I pick this DVDThankJim"
2,Sadness overwhelms,"Well, but you can never go back, can you...I watch a lot of tv series on dvd and I think DLM is probably my all time favorite. I so wish it was not cancelled. I wanted this single ""movie"" to be great, but it just isn't. Die hard (no pun intended) fans will have to see it, but it is painful to watch in many places. I would not do the show without Rube and the real Daisy. Sarah Wynter utterly fails to grasp the part of Daisy. Poor writing for Roxie and Mason, not enogh for Joy, and just ok for Reggie. Delores was great!! Georgia shines in a few parts and just phones it in for other parts. I have watched it several times for the good stuff, but it saddens me to have to sit through the large amount of crappy stuff. You really never can go back."
3,Dead Like Me: Life After Death,"The absence of Rube and Laura Harris as Daisy is one of the bad things about this film. The part that really was like the tv series were the scenes between George and her sister, Reggie. In my opinion that was the strongest part of the film. It is definitely worth seeing for fans of the tv series. It is unfortunate the tv series was canceled because I think it is one of the best tv series I have ever seen."
1,Falls way short!!,This is a disappointment from the actual show. We looked forward to watching it after not missing one episode of show before it's sudden cancelation. It falls flat and short from the series.
1,Dead on Arrival,"What a shame. I really wanted to like this movie. I loved the series, and even though Mandy Patinkin wasn't in the cast of the movie, I am a huge fan of Lost and was looking forward to seeing Henry Ian Cusick take on the role of Mandy's replacement.The movie is terrible and doesn't do justice to the series. The actress who replaced Laura Harris as Daisy was horribly miscast. They should have just left Daisy out, as they did with Rube, and added another character.Too bad this was such a mess, but at least we had a few moments of Delores Herbig and her big brown eyes to remind us of why the series was so great."
4,A decent follow up to the show,"I really enjoyed this movie! I wasn't sure exactly what to expect from it because I obsessively loved the series when it was on Showtime, and have rewatched the episodes on dvd a few times over the years. The movie was good, but you have to keep your expectations low and have an open mind for sure. Yes, Rube is gone and Daisy has been recast, but after 5 years, we need to expect some changes. Nothing is perfect in life, but just getting to have George, Mason, Roxy and Dolores back was enough for me! Give it a shot, but if you are on the fence then don't rush out and buy it until you've watched it. I hope they bring the show back on the air, as rumor has it that is a possibility!"
2,Dead Like Me: Life After Death,There was way too much cussing in this movie. It made it very hard to watch. My husband works at a fire station were there is a lot of cussing and even he was turned off.
1,Disapointing beyond words,"This was such a huge disapointment. Watch the series, avoid this movie. The actress ""playing"" Daisy should be ashamed and embarrassed. Ellen, Callum, and Jasmine were decent, but the writing, etc did not give their characters their typical sparkle."
1,Does the show absolutely no justice,"This movie did the original series no justice. It was almost depressing at how badly the movie butchered the original characters as well as the dark humor and depth of the show. The new Daisy was portrayed in almost a laughably bad way and I felt that the plot was stretched thin at best. It almost felt like a Lifetime movie of the week, cue: overly dramatic music and heavy handed direction."
1,"This movie is a constipator, Peanut","Bad, bad, BAD!!! As other reviewers have written, I am a HUGE fan of the show, I have watched the series repeatedly on DVD, bought the sets for friends, purchased memorabilia, can quote lines, etc. I have been tracking the progress of the movie on imdb and was so excited to see that the movie was actually coming out. I received it in the mail today and couldn't wait to get home to watch it.I should have watched Two and a Half Men reruns.This is a terrible movie! No Rube, a poor Daisy replacement (should have just killed her off if this was the best that was available), Treo's instead of Post-its, Mason and Roxy called it in, Delores was a delight with the oldest living cat, Murray, no Der Waffle Haus, and many other things that just should NOT have occurred. I would rather have fond memories of the series than the stink that this movie has left.Rube Sofer: ""You're a constipator, Peanut. You disturb my sh** and that's annoying."""
2,the ending should have been the beginning.,"The last twenty minutes of this film should have been the first twenty minutes and then gone on from there. I didn't understand why they had to destroy everything from the series and replace it with 'nothing'. George, Roxie and Mason were there and they were the most interesting of the characters. Why did they feel the need to have the Daisey character with a different actress. She could have been explained away with a few word and knowing looks (they all expect to move on unexpectedly) and some new and interesting reapers could have been added. The scenes with george and her sister and then the moment when george was chosen as the head reaper were the only parts that kept the same feeling as the series. It is sad that they felt the need to take a superior idea and story line and turn it into as mediocre TV sitcom to be shown in movie theaters."
1,WHAT A SHAME!!,First off the new Daisy STINKS!!!! Worst acting EVER!!!!I just recently saw this show on amazon instant video and fell in love with it!! I was sad that there were only 2 seasons!! I got to watch both seasons for free and had to pay 9.99 to rent this online. Well what a waste of money it was!!!
4,"Had some issues, but overall enjoyed it.","I just watched the movie last night, and overall I thought it was ok. I am a huge fan of the show, and have been since it was originally broadcast. But, I did have some of the same complaints as everyone else that rated it as 3 stars or less...however, take it for what it is.I went into the experience with zero expectations. You cannot recreate the original b/c you are missing key components (Rube/""Original"" Daisy). Many reviewers are crying about them being gone...well the actors had other work, and have moved on. There were some plot inconsitancies from the original series which was disappointing, but as a standalone it was not bad.I disagree with the people that recommend ""staying away"", and not watching this movie. I would recommend picking up a copy and make your own decision."
2,What a sad ending for a good series,"Often a movie is a good place to find closure for a series canceled by the networks. Think of ""Serenity"" for the end of ""Firefly"" as a case in point.Then there are movies like this. A previous reviewer summed it up just right ""... is this it?""The unkind me would say this movie is a cynical money grab by a group of people wanting to exploit the fan base of the series they lost.The kinder, gentler me would simply say that he misses the original Daisy Adair and that he knows why Mandy Patinkin is not in it.And the plot is simply pathetic."
2,"This movie is ""Dead Like Them""","This was just bad all over -- Writing, Directing, and lifeless Acting. It was nice to see an ""all growed up"" Reggie, but that was about it. (If curious, then Google her and save yourself the cost of this DVD). This was strictly a Reunion DVD. The spark that we loved so much of in the TV series is officially dead and gone. Sadly."
1,Horrible and a waste of time!,"I loved the TV series. I thought the writing on the TV series to be smart and the ensemble of actors talented and tight. What happened five years later that they decided to make something so bad out of something that was so good?The replacement actor for Daisy was awful.Not having Mandy Patinkin in the movie at all really was stupid as his character Rube and the portrayal of that character was the heart and soul of the series.I like the other three reapers, but the script was poorly written. They tried to save this dead in the water script, but all they could do is take the soul and hope for the best.Don't waste your time watching it. Watch reruns of the TV series instead."
1,Way to ruin an amazing show with an amazingly bad movie!,"I literally cringed while watching this. I am a huge fan of the show, so I was so excited for the movie, and I tried so hard not to hate it... but it truly was terrible. On so many levels. I kind of wish I hadn't seen it so it won't taint my memories of the show. If you haven't seen the movie yet-- don't bother. I will recommend the TV show to anyone, but steer clear of this movie. :("
1,Dead On Arrival,"I have not seen the TV series, but I hope that it isn't the dismal, shoddy and incoherent-babble-production that the DVD movie was. I was on the fence when deciding to purchase this movie and let myself be convinced by the trailers I saw on another DVD and the MGM studio name. Well, shame on me for not taking the time to actually read the reviews. And shame on MGM for producing such third-rate drivel.I will not comment on the actors, actress and technical staff who made the movie. That the movie was a flop was, to give them the benefit of the doubt, probably because of the junk they were given to work with. The real losers should be the writers and those responsible for such a weak, incoherent and moronic plot & storyline along with the director who, combined, couldn't have turned out a poorer quality film if they had actually tried.Give this pathetic film a miss."
4,Dead Like Me sequel,"A good continuation of the TV series ""Dead Like Me"", although I missed the character Rube. I hope more are made."
4,Dead Like Me - Life After Death,"This direct to home video is almost as good as the original series, which means it was much funnier than 90% of the ""flavor of the week"" comedies that Hollywood seems to release by the truckload these days. It left me wanting more."
5,Superb!,"Bowman's book is an extraordinary example of scholarship by any standard. His elegant and fine-grained examination of `music' offers serious readers a range of perspectives (e.g., Music as. . . Imitation, Idea, Form, Symbol, Experience and so forth) which is unmatched in the philosophical literature for its clarity, depth, insight and comprehensiveness. It opens the widest possible window on music with the added benefit that a great deal of erroneous `old think' is totally blown away. I place Bowman's book at the top of my `must read' list for all graduate students."
2,Good but Pedantic,"Bowman's book is important for the careful detail it provides on past philosophical theories of music. But his book has three major weaknesses. Bowman's exhaustive detail is second only to his heavy, exhausting, pedantic style. (There is no life in Bowman's writing; no joy; no expression. How ironic in a book about music!). Next, his book omits to discuss most contemporary philosophers of music. Why? This is a curious and disappointing omission which makes his book far less valuable than it could have been. Good for him (and bad for us, I think) because Bowman's omissions allow him to sidestep all the difficult (but interesting and valuable) challenges that come from thinking critically about philosophical discourse in the present day."
1,Great if you like mercury,"I took this brand of fish oil for 2 weeks and ended up with a metallic taste in my mouth, dizziness and a strange toxic feeling. I googled my symptoms and came up with mercury poisoning. It went away after not taking this product for 3 days. Apparently you have to buy ultra refined fish oil in order to avoid mercury buildup in your body. This is clearly not ultra refined fish oil. I hope this helps someone..."
1,"Sadly, I now don't like Gene Wilder","Before I read this book I had enjoyed Gene Wilder as a performer, and I thought, as a person. I now feel that he has shown himself to be self-centered and uncaring. He is not a person I would ever want to meet and I cannot watch any film that he is in. This read left me sad, but not like a sad story. It left me sad because it was real and he showed himself to be unfeeling and uncaring about anyone other than himself. I feel that he harmed the people with whom he had relationships. The saddest thing is that I don't think he ever saw himself as a cold person. He just continues on with his life, treating people as if they were nothing more than stage props. Rather than re-sell this book, I threw it in the trash. I recommend spending your money on a better read. One that I enjoyed was ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"" by Mark Haddon."
3,Many references to People & Places,"Gene Wilder's ""slightly autobiographical' book gives a little insight into his life as a boy ,his close friendship with his pyschiatist Margie, the ""Demons"" which burdened him as a young man via thoughts and his wife Gilda, his sister Corrine and his own bouts successful or otherwise with Cancer...In his case his joy on ""I've won"" when the treatments were decreased from a sceduled nine to only six, turned to gratitude when he let one of the physcians who'd treated Gilda before she ""passed away"", inform him of the need for more treatment...His book hints that his major stresses are due to his concerns of why he thinks the way he thinks whenever the thoughts that lead to certain behaviour don't make sense...In its own ""not-heavy"" reading way the book is quite thought- provoking."
3,"It's ""just o.k."" applies here...","I am unclear as to why this book is rated so highly. It is not a book I would recommend, but it is not bad. ""Just o.k."" applies here. The detractors would be the therapy transcripts and the Gilda Radner section. I wish these ""tortured artists"" would spare therapists for real trauma and tragedy or at least spare us transcripts that don't deal with healing true trauma or tragedy. A few sentences about how he and Gilda met and parted would have satisfied readers and kept him from having to try so hard. It was the only part of the book where I felt him being dishonest. Still, the book accomplishes what it should. It offers great insight into Gene Wilder, his career, his connections and how his films got made. It is written in a lighthearded, very personal, style which makes it an easy and fast read. If you are already a fan of Gene Wilder, it is likely you will enjoy this. If not, this is an interesting read to pass the time but will leave no stellar impression."
1,Not as it appears,"I purchased this product on March 17th. I didn't receive it until the end of the first week of April. When it arrived the balls were either blue or orange. NOT the ""traditional billiard ball colors"" as the description reads. I waited 3 weeks and paid a lot for these (as a gift for my husband) that now has to be returned.However, the product IS solid. Good balls and good paint/art job. If you want all blue/orange balls then this is the set for you."
5,Superb Read,"This was a superb read. I came across the book unexpectedly and couldn't put it down. I found myself very surprised that I hadn't heard of it when it was published, and have to think that it must have been poorly marketed by the publisher, because it certainly hits all the buttons. Great job, Mr. McCormack - I look forward to seeking out more of your work."
1,Not worth the postage,"What a joke. I have never seen a book this badly written, with such outdated information. It is obvious the the author believes all marital problems are the fault of the husband / man. Their contention that men can't be victims of domestic violence is obtuse. The idea that if the woman withholds sex, cooking or the children, or talking bad to the children about her husband it is usually the fault of the man is unfounded and prejudicial against men. Don't waste your money on this book unless you have an outhouse (the one place the pages from this book may be useful.)"
5,Expand your horizon of gender possibilities!,"Once again, transgender writers prove to be at the cutting-edge of radical queer theory. In this thought-provoking anthology of essays and poetry, these young, diverse FTM transgender activists destabilize the gender binary and challenge us all to question what it means to be male, female, third gender, no gender, or something else entirely! While all the writings in this book are wonderful, I especially enjoyed the brilliant essays by Dean Spade and Matt Kailey! As gender regulation plays a crucial role in maintaining this oppressive system of capitalism, patriarchy and white supremacy, the implications of this book are far-reaching and revolutionary."
4,There's a lot more in Dry Water than meets the eye,"Larry Ngitis has just broken up with his girlfriend and has fled to the town of Dry Water in Seco County because of its reputation as a writer's haven, because Larry is also a writer of Science Fiction novels.Larry has had a life long precognition ability but he's about to find out in Dry Water that it is the least of his true gifts. Dry Water is the home of two of the planets most dangerous practitioners of the psychic arts, and both are convinced for differing reasons, that Larry will destroy the world if they don't destroy him - and Larry's only hope is to find the water that can't be drunk before they do.I enjoyed this novel. Larry is a likeable character, and his rivals in magic are both crazy and dangerous. This is not a thick novel, with really deep characterisations, but it has a good flow and and interesting story line with the concept of a place like Dry Water quite appealing in its way."
3,not as excited as I thought,"Only the one song I bought the cd for (""Small"") and the title track are really worth playing over and over. The five variations on two of the songs get tiresome. I haven't bought a whole cd in years, and now I remember why."
4,Better than Fear,"I really adore this group. I was introduced to them by a friend in NYC that DJ's and has worked with them. I first heard their debut back in '96 and was instantly hooked. I got the rare fortune of meeting them on their tour in '99. Although I don't care for the album it was promoting (Fear of Fours) it was an incredible show and they are so nice and genuine. I love this album though, it has depth and quality. I do regret buying it on new & on import .. instead of waiting for this package to come out. I don't know if I should buy it again for the second disc? I am aching to hear the mixes and see the ""Sweet"" video, but I just don't know. Anyhow, I would strongly recommend this to any Trip-Hop, Drum & Base, or just fan of good music. So original, so beautiful."
3,"okay, where's the funky beats?","Maybe I was hoping too much for an albumn to rival the first Lamb album. This album is okay and her voice is great, even better then the other albums, but it focuses way too much on her voice and seems to pretty much forget about all the cool beats and interchange between singer and dj that the first Lamb had. Gabriel does not come close to Gorecki, mainly because it never really has the drum and bass part that kicks in towards the midle of Gorecki and makes that song so awesome."
2,Yeah but...SHE CAN'T SING!,"Look, I'm the first one in line to jump around extolling the virtues of not-so-well-known artists and bands, because there is so much great music to be found, but this is one that suffers from something that should have been nipped in the bud way back in the recording phase.The singer is OUT OF TUNE people!The music production and inventiveness here is quite good, but that's it.Someone like Madonna might barely squeak by with her little voice, but this is worse; even the vocal HARMONIES are out of tune! What does that tell you?Lose the singer, because no amount of electrnic wizardry can cover up this laughably weak voice."
3,"Good, but not stellar.","I'd been waiting for this for some time. Few albums have touched me the way that Lamb's first album did. I think I like Lamb best in their first album - a little unfocused, a little raw, a little wild but full of energy. Something seems to be muted in their latest relase. I only hope that they again will find the restless energy and beauty found on earlier works.However, as most have mentioned, Gabriel is an intense, moving song, and anybody that loves or appreciates Lamb should get this album for this song."
4,SWEET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What Sound is the latest addition to my (i have to admit it) Brief personal catalog of electronic music, im more into less artificial genres, but this cd is one of that rare releases that make you think, ""mmmmmmhhhhh!!! this is good stuff"" , ""sweet"" entered to mi ears and my brain assimilated along with a funny and simple videoclip so easily and nice that i purchased this album the next day and i was not dissapointed, ""Gabriel"" was another bonus surprise, arrangemets, rithms, production, everything is so elegant, exciting and melancholic that ""what sound"" is an album that worths to include in every contemporary music collectionHM"
3,TR The Last Revelation,"I purchased this video to complete my TR collection. The game was cutting-edge when it came out years ago and was, in my humble opinion, one of the best video games on the market! Now this version is dwarfed in game-play, graphics and physics engines. Still a great game and a must-have as part of the total TR collection!This game was purchased at Amazon and was delivered quickly and in excellent condition."
3,Tired,"The same old boring jump-push-pull-find game. Great fun, but the action isn't that exciting. There are too many trap possibilities, where starting over is the only option. The jeep and motorcycle sections are cool, and the shooting is great fun, as well as the cinematic sequences. But all in all it's mostly hours of running and jumping and climbing in very similar looking tombs."
5,A return to its roots...,I like the way this game looks and plays. As a fan of the series I am glad to see TR: Last Revelation more like the first game rather than the Third game which was frustratingly difficult at times. New comers to the series should enjoy this game as well for it has plenty of challenge and adventure to offer.
3,Great graphics but...,"Unlike the other reviewers I had never played the previous Tomb Raider games. I bought this one because it looked cool. Yes, the graphics are excellent and so is the music, but who can control this game? The movements are jerky and highly inaccurate. This requires countless replaying of certain parts, since jumps are not exactly perfect or she is not standing at the exact spot to trigger levers, etc. Even though I like the ""look"" of the game, it is very tiring to play it for longer periods of time, since the controller problems really get on my nerves. The camera angle is not that great either and wastes time trying to figure out which way she is facing now. Yes, the game is beautifully animated and the story line is kind of cool (since I love Egyptian stuff), but so far this has been more a pest than a fun game I can't get enough off."
2,Too much Tomb Raiding,"I'm a huge fan of the TR series, and I like the movies as well. TR1 and TR2 were the best in terms of story, pacing and action. The CG sequences were cooler too. I hate to say it, but I'm disappointed in this game. TOO SLOW! The levels go on forever, and there's nothing to keep your interest. Ocassionally you will have a ninja jump out at you, or some scorpians, but that's not enough to keep you interested.The other problems is the levels require too much backtracking and are too complicated. I got stuck numerously and ending up getting a code off the internet to skip levels. The beginning of the game shows promise with young Lara, and there is a very cool level where Lara has to manuver a jeep in the desert and over cliffs and whatnot.I don't know what I can recommend instead of this one, but I would say rent it or get it for cheap like $5 or less used or new. She tomb raids for too long with little payoff."
1,Waste of time... not to mention paper and ink,"I wish I could blame a friend's recommendation for reading this awful book. But no, I read some reviews on here that promised some great literature. Well I'm not sure if they were the author's friends or what but this is definitely a disappointment!"
2,Hunninbird Portable battery,"Very disappointed. The product did NOT come with a cable to connect it to my PirahnaMax 230. Nowhere, with either product did it tell you the cable was required or even how to order it as an accessory. When I called, I was told the cable works with everyone of their products but a handful. Whay not just include it with the battery????????????????????"
5,Right choice,"So far so good, I haven't had the chance to use it, but from the looks and the charger being included, don't see why not. I will be using it for a 385ci COLOR that I also purchased here in november for an EXCELLENT price. Since amazon has been the best as far as price, I've been able to get a ram mount, screen and dust cover for my finder, transducer bracket, etc All of those products for under $400. tks amazon"
5,Humminfird Portable Battery,I purchased this battery for use with a Lowrance Mark 4 Fish Finder / GPS. The battery works great for this low power application providing enough power to use the Lowrance for several trips before requiring a recharge. I'm very pleased with the performance and would not hesitate to recommend this battery for this or similar applications.
5,seems to work,I adopted a dog with severe hip problems. The vet recommended supplements. I am on my second bottle and see a decided improvement in mobility.
2,Quality went down--way down.,"We have the same exact cushion- purchased a couple of years ago with the same Saddleman logo, that had much better and thicker cushioning. The material on these newer editions (at least both of the ones I ordered) were coming unglued from the inner cushion. Very flimsy in general, which is too bad, because we loved the old Elegant/Saddleman product. We have searched high and low on the internet and all the auto parts stores for a quality bubble cushion, but we are convinced that they no longer exist."
5,I highly recommend this work,The concepts in this book have strenghtened the loving care we provide at our hospice. Our patients and families love the angels of hospice who provide true sacred encounters. I would recommend this work to ANY healthcare organization committed to providing the best care imaginable.
1,Very Slight,"Is Donna Leon getting tired? This reads like a book dutifully churned out because another 'Brunetti' was due. It never gets beneath the surface. There are plenty of excellent elements -- the central idea, tracing through 'blood diamonds' & what happens to them -- is really good. But it is never used properly. We get a lot of Venetian atmosphere, true -- but not much else. Even if it meant leaving Venice for a bit, surely the central point could've been followed through.And why do Paola & Brunetti react to the Italian situation as an American left-winger would? They are supposed to be Italians. Would they really worship & revere the State as American left-wingers do?Disappointing. Please just work out a proper plot, Ms Leon, next time."
2,Disappointing Brunetti mystery. Kindle edition fine.,"I was disappointed in this book, as, SPOILER WARNING, the detective never gets to solve the mystery as the case is taken away from him. The Venetian setting is always a delight. The Kindle edition is excellent, with no problems."
2,"ehhh, not so user friendly","I hate to say that this timer is difficult to use, maybe just not user friendly is a better term. You have to rotate the large outer ring to activate the timer. First, the hours blink, wait,,,,wait,,,, then the minutes,wait,,,,wait,,,then seconds. When I'm cooking, I usually have a few things going, and this just seems to waste my time."
1,"GREAT product, LOUSY company","I have used this medication and it has helped my dog with his GI issues enormously, but I will NEVER buy from Discount Pet Supplies again. They ignored repeated e-mails, did not make a requested change in my order even after I spoke to a representative who said they would, and basically did NO customer service whatsoever from the instant they had their money onwards... I am left wondering if the product FROM THEM is even the real medication, since their business practices are so poor. The GASTRI_CALM is WONDERFUL; the Discount Pet Supplies company is HORRIBLE!!! Buy the meds, but buy from a better company!!"
1,Terrible product!! Do not buy!!,"I bought this toy with the rope in the middle from a local store. Within five minutes my 70lbs Airedale had torn both ends off with chunks of rubber everywhere. He swallowed some of the rubber before I could take it away from him, but it was too late. He was sick for the next 18 hours vomiting and he was very lethargic. I will NEVER buy another TireBiter product ever again. Their packaging is very misleading making the buyer think it's for a tough chewer. Stay away from TireBiter."
1,Lasted less than one minute with my dog,"This looks like it ought to be as tough as a kong or other ""extreme"" chew toy, but it took my 50 lb dog less than a minute to chew a big chunk off the end."
1,inadequately sticky,"The pad doesn't seem to be sticky enough to hold itself to a dashboard, let alone hold anything in place. I tried rinsing it as recommended and this did not seem to help.Friends have told me that they've used similar items with great success, so I think the concept is fine, but this one wasn't sticky enough for me to use."
5,"Used for other purpose, worked great","First, I must say I did not use this to hold a phone on a dashboard or anything like that. I have a sunroom with slippery glossy tile on the floor and my couch sits on rubber furniture pads but still contantly slips and moves. I cut these pads to put under the rubber furniture pads between them and the floow and no more slipping. They work great because of their tackiness and I am very happy I bought them."
1,Not happy,"I put this product on my dashboard, and immediately all four edges curled up. I purchased two and returned them."
2,edges,"The stickiness is good, but it seems to be so thin that the edges don't lay flat. It's kind of annoying how only the center of the pad stays on the dashboard, while the edge all the way around is sticking up in the air."
1,never did get it.,"sounds like a wonderfull book but here almost 1 year later i still havent gotten the book, a response from amazon, or a response from the shipper."
2,"GREAT record but yes, LOUSY cd","Contrary to one of the many glowing reviews of this cd, this cd WAS INDEED remastered incorrectly. Yes, Chet's technique intentionally created the interesting effects you hear and read about in other fans reviews here, but don't let their lousy ears fool you into buying this. I have the lp and the cd and I always go back to the lp because the cd was mastered so poorly. Whoever was responsible at Razor and Tie for the crummy sound should be ashamed of himself. He took a wonderful Christmas classic and butchered it. What a pity, since Chet's recordings were always so top notch! A blue Christmas, indeed..."
4,Made in China,Very solid and sharp. Looks like it will hold up a a lot better than my OXO.The reason that I give it 4 stars is because I thought that it was made in Germany and not in China.I thought that the high price tag was due to the fact that it was NOT made in China.
1,"UPS - Says ""Could not find my address""","Order the level in the first week of June. Amazon notify me on July 16 that its been return by ""UPS"" said they couldn't find my address"" after 7 years of UPS delivering Amazons orders to the same address. They can't find my house. Maybe I'll get Michael Moore and Art Rooney on their Backs. Now I know why ""UPS"" uniforms are brown."
2,Cooking With Grace,"I have more than 600 cookbooks (it's like a disease!). The majority of them are Italian. I read them from cover-to-cover, not only for recipes but for the ethnic flavor of Italy, and of Italian-Americans who carry on our traditions. Rating a new Italian cookbook against my library is a daunting test for the book and its author. Unfortunaly, while there are some good recipes in this book, it is over-simplified and does not compare with what I consider to be the top books of this genre recently published, i.e. Biba Caggiano's Taste of Italy or Fred Plotkin's La Terra Fortuna. Ms. Pilato cooks with grace, but she needs to add a pinch more meat in her pages."
2,How many lies in the title?,"Jackie Chan's Invinvible Crime Force....One, Jackie Chan has a small and uncreditted bit in the film.Two, the ""crime Force"" isn't -- they're escaped POW's in a WWII story out to destroy a weapons plant...It's really Brigitte Lin and Sally Yeh's picture, and it's horribly dubbed, the transfer isn't any good, and the ""score"" is ripped from half a dozen other pictures -- I liked the wordless choir lift from Once Upon a Time In The West, myself....Bad enough that it's kind of entertaining.Originally titled ""GOlden Queen's Amazons""Invincible Fighter is a video compilation of great moments from some of his early films.. fine, except that it's plainly been mastered badly from a VHS original, the image is panned and scanned and the burned in subtitles run off the edges fo the frame. This package would be overpriced at a dollar."
2,You get what you pay for :(,"This item is listed as a mouthwash container.It is so small, you have to refill it 3 X a week."
3,I hate this new conceited Abby!,"Abby suddenly cares only about herself and Simon. She isn't paying any attention to Hannah, Casey, Mason, or Bethany, and when Natalie suddenly starts acting nasty she doesn't even bother to find out why, or to help her friend. Also, she is way too crazy over Simon. I am 12 and nobody likes me and I don't like anybody. I love the old Abby Hayes, but now she's just weird. If I had a friend like her, I would be very upset about how mean she's acting. Have you noticed Simon backwards in ""Nomis""? Like No Miss??? In other words, I DO NOT feel like I was missing out in the other books. I think Anne Mazer should just cool it with the crushes and make Abby more like her old self that everyone loves."
4,Book,it was a good book wasn't very long though it is a good fairy tail for young readers I like it!
5,no issues...,Book was receive in expected condition as agreed upon. It made a good gift. All is good. :-)
3,Good but not Superlative,"Montague's book is great as a definitive compilation of the wars of the classical Greco-Roman world. I, however, found it lacking because the author did not go into depth in any particular battle. Battlefield schimatics, which would bring an entirely more comprehensive depth to the text, are rare, and the military tactics of some of the world's greatest generals find themselves subordinate to the breadth of the subject itself."
4,Irresistible,Another one of Mary Balogh books that once you start reading you can't put the book down. Page after Page holds your interest. A great read.
4,A heart-warming story,"I have always been a fan of Ms. Balogh, and have enjoyed all the books in this trilogy. The story of Sophie and Nat is a great story of friends, lovers and intrigue. Unlike most stories today, where the main characters seem to meet and have sex immediately thereafter, this story allows the characters to grow. Longtime friends who refind each other. The secondary story of the book is amusing too. Anyone who has a close group of college buddies or friends will find the relationships in this book very realistic."
4,solid as old iron,"Look,when I first heard this band,I would have swore they were a southern rock troupe,but hell,they're from Syracuse.And when you listen to them you can smell stale beer,cig smoke and the exaust from a shovelhead.If you like Hellyeah,Down and even Clutch,eventhough clutch isnt as hard,grab yerself a 12pack of this and pop a top."
3,"Looks great, parts difficut & didn't come together","Seperate material parts were of good quality, but unplease with how the parts did not fit together & what had to be done to make them fit.Did not like that several of the parts that were suppose to easily screw together & did not. Took lots of time & strength to get the pieces to fit properly and ended up bending part of the fixture to make it work - which made it look defective then."
5,A good find,The jersey was just as it was described and exactly what my husband wanted. I would make a purchase from this vendor again.
1,Wait for a better format,"Although the subject of this novel is great, and the writing is strong, the poor formatting is disappointing. I couldn't get past the lack of paragraphs. The scene changes were lost because of a lack of clear chapter and paragraph delineation and it was difficult to read. This would probably be a good book if I could get through it. I'd suggest waiting to purchase it until it comes out in a better format. There's really no excuse in this digital age for sloppy books like this."
2,Blackwater 60 Minutes Sepcial,"This video is to short and lacks any real detail about the inner workings of Blackwater. The video is only 7 minutes long, and is just a review of standard news reports. More information can be found on YouTube. Do not waste your money on this 7 minute video."
4,inexpensive -works well,"the package came with everything that was needed, unless you need to update drivers for new computers. It worked fine compared to the more expensive options!if you have kids, expect to go through batteries fairly quick or if you use the computer all day."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I am very sorry I did not read the reviews here before I wasted my time and $ on this piece of junk. I am still using my old keyboard as I am going to trash this today and order the Microsoft one. In the words of my late Grandmother ""cheap is dear"""
3,Not what I expected,"I received this as a gift. I was born and raised in Eastern North Carolina and then moved to the mountains. The cookbook seemed a little Eastern and Piedmont heavy. Not that that is bad, however, I was hoping for some good recipes from food so commonly found in the western part of the state, especially sauce for barbecue. I am totally in love with Western N.C. barbecue (Eastern is vinegar based, Western is tomato based) Also lacking in cornbread and biscuit recipes. I will say that the recipes that I have made out of it are excellent, therefore I gave it a 3 star rating."
5,Celtic Dragons,"This item was received in the timeframe promised, and is of beautiful workmanship. It is a solid silver piece, giving it some weight, which helps it lay nicely on the chain. Very unique design. The dragons are not obvious, so it's a conversation piece once you point them out."
5,Simply Good,"To put it succinctly: this is a solid, well-written, nicely plotted mystery set in seventh century Ireland, where women had greater rights than they probably have today. Historically accurate (within reason for a mystery novel), this is about as good as the genre gets."
1,Waste of Money,"Recieved the product in a remarkble time, but when I tried to load the software onto my PDA the software would never read onto the PDA. Tired to load on three different PDA's had the same problem for each. SO nice shipping time but busted scanner. (waste of money)"
2,Couldn't relate to the pathetic main character,"Perhaps I have difficulty relating to the struggling actor/model/waiter/writer that typifies the main character of this book. Despite the comic backdrop against which this story was written, I found the main character thoroughly unlikable, and thus I dreaded picking up the book every time I set it down."
3,Almost Too Normal,"An avarage performance that doesn't vibrate in my heart much.This is almost too normal to me.The expression of climax is formulative rather than creative and passionate thus sounds more like an exaggration.Some may like this kind of showing off but I prefer more honest and direct kind of performance.To compare with anoter normal performance, one by Marie-Claire Alain (Erato)(three P&Fs;, Sonata 1, 3 and 6) is slightly better to me (She is smooth and nice as usual)The other one I have is six sonatas by Jacques Amade which is not easy listening but much more interesting.One thing about this recording is that maybe because the organ is huge, echoes bounce around everywhere and it is hard to capture clear cut sound. It must be nice to be in the cathedral to enjoy the romaticism of Mendelssohn played on huge organ, but I don't get that feeling in this recording."
1,Hate it!!!,"Her live CD is fantastic, but this album sucks. She is trying out her western country music influences here, and it's not good. She has a great voice and as long as she sticks to European style she will fare well. Otherwise: farewell to any more blind album purchases via the internet."
1,A convoluted piece of crap!,"35 min into this film I was waiting for something to happen,,,at the end,,,I was still waiting for something to happen.The jumping between flashbacks and downtown Tokyo was the most irritating thing I've seen in recent memory.No plot,,,no dialogue,,,nothing!And worse,,,a butchered depiction of PTSD.Most sufferers kill themselves not others.Total crap!"
2,Sand Scorpion,"I when i got this Gi Joe I was very dissapoited.Both His legs bend to the left, His pants are very thin and his hands dont move very well. Also his boots come off way to easy.I dont recommend this Gi Joe.The Only cool thing about this Gi Joe is his armor and tail."
5,Very simple and engrossing!! Excellent!,"An excellent bit of writing!! Very descriptive of life in Sri Lanka! It takes you to the scene of the stories! It is very thought provoking, and grabbed my attention from the time I started reading it. I couldn't put it down till I was done. The stories are full very detailed, and yet very simple and comprehensible.It is as good as The Reef. I would recommend it for anyone."
5,best Tape measure ever!,"best Tape measure in the world, it is my favorite, small enough to go most everywhere with you, and has a the best belt clip that wont fall off easily, that releases easily and put right back on without having to struggle with it, like holstering a gun, you don't have to look, it slides in and a reassuring click says it is safely looked in place, it is not very wide, but if it were it would get hung up on more things, it looked like they were doing away with this model, so I bought 3 more of them!"
4,A new twist,"This book gives things a real twist~ For me I just started Replica and I've been eating the books up! This is deffintly, a new twist and the ending was good~ I'll defintly be reading more about Amy and all of her friends soon!"
4,Lucky I got this book....it's good!,"This is a good book. I will tell you a little about it so you can decide if you want it or not. Amy meets a reject clone, Allie. Allie thinks they are biological sisters or something, but Amy knows what really happened. Allie is jealous of Amy and vice versa. I didn't like the ending or some of the story, but this book is a must buy!"
3,Very good compliation*,"*the only problem I have is the track before, ""I Like It"" continues into, ""I Like It"" and it creates an audible pause in the opening chords."
3,Ok,I bought one just like this before from micheals for some reason that one works better . Good buy tho
2,The Tarot Workbook,"There is interesting information here for beginners. I was looking for the symbolism of pairs, the numbers and suits, for example. There are sections revealing info that is not usually in beginner books but it is all concise and simplified. I keep it as a reference for these things and re read it. Thoughtful overviews, beautiful layouts so you easily get a sense of the meanings of important things with Information easy to find. I downgrade this book because the meanings contained for the cards do not have meanings significant to my queries. I try to use them but usually turn to another source to get the gist of the reading."
3,"A little good, a little bad","First, the bad: my copy of this DVD had some technical problems; the audio was fuzzy, although understandable with some concentration on my part; there was considerable pixellation (picture breakup) in the segment on casting the young girl in a leotard, to the point of being unwatchable; the segment on casting from a silicone torso mentioned in the description was not on the DVD; there was nothing about actually making a casting from the molds created - the DVD would be better titled as Molding the Female Torso. Now, the good: the technique demonstrated for molding from a nude model was clearly presented; I was able to make my first fully successfull mold by following the instructions. The segment on creating a patinaed surface was also worthwhile. I probably should have returned this DVD in hope of getting a better quality replacement. Overall, I would recommend this DVD for its educational content, but be aware of the aforementioned problems."
2,$60 Could Have Been Better Spent,"I bought both ""How to Create an Artistic Face Casting"" and ""Casting the Female Torso"" DVD's, and I have buyer's regret. I won't call them a rip-off, but they are overpriced. Each DVD could be condensed to about 4 minutes of information. The rest is fluff.The DVD's do not go beyond basics. How to do a full body cast, for instance, is not hinted at. Or how to cast a round body part, such as an arm.If both DVD's were combined into one and sold for $15, they would be a good deal.As it is, unless you're trying to spend money, you might do better with another video or a library book.I do wonder if the $30-dollar price tag isn't a result of small-press distribution costs and the makers of these videos aren't earnest in their desire to share what they know, but currently the videos are not informational enough to justify the cost.I've now spent $60 on both these videos to learn body casting and I'm really not much further along than I was before the videos."
4,Book on Bridge stratagies,I bought this book for my mother-in-law. She has found it to be very helpful in her playing with all her friends on Bridge night.
3,need more dead like me.,Please mark this DVD set as X. I am very happy with The Complete Collection Dead Like Me:BUT the F word was used over and over and over again made me go brain dead..
3,An amusing concept of Death,"The complete DVD collection of ""Dead Like Me"" is well worth the money and time spent viewing. The series of two seasons is just right and offers a quirky insight on the after-life. The movie of five years later is not as well done and serves only as a filler. I know Ellen Muth personally and can attest that she was well casted and played to her own personality and quirky charm. Dr. Jim H."
3,"Thought-provoking book, cheap ending","The subject matter of this book was interesting, timely, thought-provoking. Much of the book was unrealistic, of course, but still rather engaging. The ""twist"" at the end was soooo cheap, so Hollywood, it pretty much ruined the book for me.Sort of a spoiler coming up. There was a real case over the last couple of years at Mt. Sinai in NY where a healthy brother donated his kidney to his brother. The healthy brother died as a result of the operation to donate his kidney, and his brother lived. If the author really felt the need to have the well sister die and the sick sister live, this would have been a far more realistic, and less manipulative, way of doing it."
5,A Hauntingly Reaslitic Novel- must read!,"When i first began reading My Sister's Keeper, i was not sure i liked the story jumping around from every character's point of view, but that uncertainty quickly disappeared. This is an amazing book because it seems so real, more like non-fiction. I'm very busy and do not really read for pleasure much, but i couldn't put it down and finished it very quickly, you should do the same!"
5,my sisters keeper,"I very much enjoyed this book. It was thought provoking and gripping. I was captivated by the charecters. I was also surprised that I was sucked in right away and couldn't seem to put it down. When I wasnt able to read the book, I would constanly go over in my mind what was happening with the charecters and question my self as to what I would do in that situtation. I recommend reading this book very highly."
4,Great book...,"I loved the book. The writing was excellent and boy, does it evoke a kaleidoscope of emotions! I was soo torn throughout the book (yet silently cheering Anna on)...only to be devastated at the end. If I was the type to cry at books, I would have cried reading this one. Really touching. 2 thumbs up."
4,"Well Written, Good Story","This book is a terrific read. Great story, well written, and interesting. The primary plot of the book is obviously the most interesting and thought provoking. SOme of the sub-plots were a little cheesy and unnecessary. However, the sub-plots take up very little of the book. Definitely read this book."
1,"Flat characters, heavy melodrama","I put this book down after I was introduced to my SEVENTH first person character in 70 pages. Not to mention at least 3 or 4 chronology jumps.Its as if Piccoult doesn't trust her writing to stand on its own. And rightfully so... If the writing supported the book, I might tolerate it. But her writing is horrible: stilted, and filled with corny metaphors, textbook emotion, its just...insufferable , at least to me.Don't get pulled in by the subject matter.Its a great concept but the execution is abysmal.Lifetime movie indeed."
5,"Excellent read, I couldn't put it down",I first read Vanishing Act by the same author which I thought was excellent. I then ordered this book and I was mesmerized from the first page. I love how the author gives everyone's perspectives. I was a bit surprised at the ending but still foudn the book to be very very very good. I just went and bought 2 more books by this author.
3,Thoughtful read...,"I enjoyed reading ""My Sister's Keeper"". It's the first Jodi Picoult book I read and it's made me interested in reading her other works. The book was simply written and it's interesting to obtain the story from multiple perspectives or voices. Many issues were explored and questioned and probed incisively, though I agree with some other reviewers that the ending is truly capricious and erratic. Overall, it's still a good read and the questions it asks are worthy of deeper thought and consideration."
4,My Sister's Keeper,"I had a minor problem with the product, but it was resolved quickly. The service was excellent."
3,Cop-out Ending,"This book told a fascinating story. As a parent of small children, it was easy to put myself in the shoes of these parents. What would you do if your toddler had a deadly disease? Wouldn't you do anthing in your power to save her? What if your choice was hurting your other child? Although the mother in this story was more a villain than necessary, I could understand her panic when confronted with the possible death of her daughter. I liked the different points of view and found Anna's situation heartbreaking and compelling. I was ready to give the book five stars.... right until the ending. The ending was a terrible cop-out; I couldn't believe it even as I was reading it. I'm certain the author thought this ending was the neatest way to tie up any loose endings, but ANYTHING else, regardless of how messy or hurtful, would have been better."
3,"Involving Story, Cop-Out Ending","This book was well written with a very intriguing premise; should 13 year old Anna, who was conceived as a cord blood donor for her older, leukemia stricken sister, have the right to make her own decisions about continuing to assist her sister medically?This book held my interest up to the conclusion, which was a complete disappointment and a bit of a cop-out. **WARNING** Stop reading here if you haven't read the book or don't want to read a mild spoiler.Something extremely improbable happens at the end of the story, which renders the entire question of Anna's medical rights moot. Note to the author - anyone with the medical condition of one of the characters involved in the incident after Anna's last court appearance would not be allowed to have a driver's license. I felt incredibly cheated by this ending, although it certainly allowed the writer to tie everything up neatly."
1,Never read her books again,I do not like the ending of any of her books. This one especially. I will not read another one of her books. The endings are not something that happens in reality. I like a book that is real. That is why they changed the movie to make it more realistic. No one likes to read a book and then be disappointed in it when you close the book.....
2,The biggest downer I have every read!,"This author takes an interesting subject,appears to create believablecharacters, then ruins the whole effort with an obvious attempt to createtabloid type,lurid sensationalism. What a cop-out. What a waste of timeto explore and cheapen a serious issue."
2,Such promise! Such a BAD ending,"This is the second book by Picoult that I have read--both because my book discussion group made the choice. Both books grabbed me at the beginning and I liked it and then the ENDING. I know she is popular with many (including my book group) but I am like so many others that think the author takes the reader so far with exiting and grabbing stories and then! OPPS! We need an ending. I know that life isn't fair, but this ending! I loved the lawyer and his dog. I would ask the author to write about him but I wouldn't like the ending! The concept of concieving a child to help another child is current and worth while reading about. So read the book ---but skip the ending."
4,Good Book,"This was my first book of Jodi Picoult's long history of novels. I read it in one day because I was inthralled. The writing is not fantastic, in fact, it is somewhat mediocre, but I was not reading because of her style. I was reading because I was fascinated with her characters. I related to her dysfunctional family and felt as if I were one of the struggling family members. This is a captivating read because Ms. Picoult is able to weave the reader into the story so that she experiences the pain along with the joy of the family members."
5,Excellent.,"This is is a book you will not want to finish with your children near. Find a closet, get comfortable, and finish it alone. Aside from the story itself, the writing was brilliant, a very, very, good read."
4,Compelling,"A cousin of mine --and a survivor-- who has experienced cancer in her own family several times over (herself, her husband, her daughter) once said to me, ""Cancer consumes the whole family's life--not just the patient's."" My Sister's Keeper, aside from raising important ethical questions, certainly shows just that. Throughout, I found my judgmental attitude toward various family members turning sympathetic and then back again. This is a compelling story that raises lots of questions but no comforting assurance of correct answers."
2,Good book ruined with a bad ending,"I am glad to hear that the movie has the opposite ending as the book. Admittedly, the book is captivating and brings up some issues worth thinking about. However, when I got to the end of the book I felt as if the author just gave up and took the easy way out. I even woke up in the middle of the night after reading the book, furious at the ending. Of course, in life there are tragic and unexpected events, but I really felt that the ending was a stretch - very unrealistic. It was kind of like watching a bad soap opera. The author spent a lot of time describing the feelings of each character leading up to this ending but then wrote an abrupt and catastrophic ending without really allowing time to explore the consequences of it. So thumbs up for the great writing style and ability to keep the reader interested and thinking. But overall I was totally in shock and disappointed in the end result of the book."
3,"Interesting topic, decent writing","Though I wouldn't call the writing spectacular, the subject matter of this story is enough to make up for it. Filled with tension, sadness, and many difficult decisions, it was a very interesting read and good for discussion. The ending was a little too convenient with a predictable movie-like twist, but beyond that, I was not disappointed. I don't know if I would be compelled to pick up another of Piccoult's works, but may give her another try in the future."
3,Profoundly Depressing,"This novel deals with a family's experience that is undoubtedly quite rare. The characters are presented in a way that you hear each person's viewpoint, though it is not always understandable. The subject matter is depressing, the characters are depressing, and the resolution is worse. I did not like this book, but give it three stars because it is well executed."
5,Excellent Book,This book was my selection in my book club last month. It came under high recommendation from my aunt. This book was an excellent book along with being a quick read.
4,"Powerful, heartwrenching","If you are a member of a family, this book will make you think and probably make you cry.There is no getting around the fact that Anna was picked before birth because she was a genetic match for her cancer-stricken sister. After years of donating renewable resources to her older sister, she is told -- at the tender age of 13 -- that she will be donating a kidney.From here on out the Picoult gets into how Anna must feel, and how she's coping. We hear from both parents, who oddly have very differing views on what her sister's illness is doing to Anna and the family. We see the love --- and resentment --- that Anna has for her sister.This is a very thought-provoking book. Would you side with Anna in the medical emancipation lawsuit? Are you sure about that?A great book. I couldn't put it down, but I sometimes found it difficult to read through the tears."
4,Well Written and Thoughtful,"Jodi Picoult gives us plenty to think about in this novel. She tugs at a parent's heart in ways that most of us never consider. You find yourself rooting for everyone - there are really no bad guys, just people trying to live their lives under very difficult circumstances. Even though the characters are at odds with each other, Jodi Picoult makes it easy to relate to their plight. I recommend reading the book before you watch the movie."
1,My Sisters Keeper,"This is my first of her books, also my last. Way too much sorrow just added for the fun of it. The ending was terrible."
3,Good enough to keep a book club talking for a couple hours,Quite a page turner but I could have done without the individualized print for each character's voice (were her words not vivid enough to convey each character's voice so that someone had to come up with the clever idea to differentiate between characters with different fonts?). It's a good enough book for a discussion group - very thought provoking - but ultimately one that gets passed on to the used book store.
3,i wanted to kill her after i read this novel.,"Okay. so this girl has lukeimia. and the parents have doctors engineer a perfect match their daughter, so they can use this new kid for spare parts. Well the spare parts kid turns 13 and decides to sue her parents for medical independency, so that SHE can decide whether or not she wants to give her sister her own kidney.its a really difficult topic. it also includes a love story between the lawyers which is hot. i really HATED the mother though.but, and i won't give it away. but the ""ENDING"" was an escape. she couldn't SOLVE the problem or show which horrible solution would happen. she jumped ship!!! this conclusion doesn't answer the problem it runs from it. shame, shame on you!!! what a coward!!! you should have chosen a side instead of flaking out!!!"
5,My Sister's Keeper is a definite keeper!,"This book and Keeping Faith are my two favorites by this remarkable author. Keep those stories coming about families, their problems, and their resolutions. This one had a gripping story with a fantastic twist. It was also the book that got me to buy most all of Ms. Picoult's works."
2,Great story - busted at the end!,"I was hooked on the story from the beginning. It was a great premise and Jodi fleshed out the characters very well. There were great emotional insights, lots of tension - - just what one would expect from family going through something like this. It was a very thought provoking story.....until the end. BAM! All the emotional ties and tension busted in one chapter. A five star rating plummeted quickly. Instead of leaving the reader with a moral issue to think about, Jodi wrapped up everything in such a contrived and maudlin manner. Why write such an edgy, morally difficult story if you were going to cave in with such a ""soap opera"" style ending? I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this book because the emotional buildup and investment is not the worth the ending the author gave us."
4,Very Enjoyable!,"I want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book.It is well written, insightful and filled with emotion.The characters are well rounded and realistic.I simply could not put it down. I am a new reader to this author,but already have another of her books on my stack, and several otherson my wishlist.A good read needs a good ending. Too many good books fall apart at the end, and simply do not measure up. This book does."
3,Thought provoking,Thought-provoking and dramatic. Ending was too far-fetched and unfortunate for such a strong book with insightful narratives from each character's perspective. Definitely worth a read and for me was a great introduction to Jodi Picoult's style - I am now a fan and am trawling my way through her work.
5,Prefer Book over Book,"I love Jodi Picoult's books. I have yet to come across one that I did not enjoy reading. Jodi chooses to write about common controversial issues that many people are faced with, or at least see the arguments in the public. Each book grabs the reader in a different way and I would recommend any of her books to anyone! I recommended this book to one of my friends, and she said that it hit a little too close to home for her. Complete tear jerker!SPOLIER:If you have someone close to you that is going through the horrible battle of cancer, or if you have lost a loved one from cancer and are VERY sensitive to the subject, I would NOT recommend this book or movie."
4,One of Picoult's best,"Like many of her books, My Sister's Keeper is a completing engrossing page turner. I literally could not put it down. The book is written alternately from the perspectives of the main characters, which allows Picoult to provide each character's point of view and the reason behind their decisions. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it (as well any of the Jodi Picoult books!)"
4,family drama about teenage girls,"Jodi Picoult - My Sisters KeeperFirst novel I've read by this author. More or less played the way you'd expect, although the ending was different than I anticipated. Still it was good. I cant really say if the point of view is accurate, never having been a teenage girl myself."
3,"Entertaining, but lacking depth","The pretense of Picoult's novel is instantly intriguing; a 13 year old, Anna, who exists solely to keep her leukemic sister Kate alive by means of transplants of blood, bone marrow, and whatever else might be needed, since Anna has been genetically engineered to be a match to her sister. However, the novel is disappointing. Picoult tries to draw depth and insight from her mundane characters, constantly taking side trips from the plot to small events in the past that would be otherwise irrelevant, had not it been for the far-fetched connection drawn at the end of each of these passages. The novel's conclusion, however, is exceptionally brilliant, and will leave readers stunned. I only wish I could have sidestepped the many reminiscences of the girls' melodramatic mother and the maddeningly feeble romance between two lawyers to get to it."
5,Amazing Book!,"Although I am only 13 years old, I enjoyed My Sister's Keeper so much! Since the main character Anna is 13, I felt really comfortable reading this book and could really imagine what it would be like to be in her situation. My mom loves all of Jodi Picoult's books and she recommended that I read My Sister's Keeper. At first I was a little wary about reading such a long book that is meant for adults, but I ended up loving it! I read the book in less than a day and I understood every single word of it. I think that all kids would be able to understand this book and they would most likely enjoy it as much as I did! I hope this review helped you understand what it was like for a young girl to read this book."
4,Enjoyed this novel and many levels,"I read this novel as part of my research on PGD (preimplantation genetic diagnosis). But surprisingly became really involved in the story and its characters. I enjoyed Picoult's device of using the different characters to narrate the story and the conflicting points of view. For the bioethics student I felt this novel helps to understand the ethical and moral positions in a more concrete way. It is easy for ethicists to talk in abstract terms, but a novel such as this with rich and candid emotion helps to illustrate how real ethical dilemmas can be. I genuinely enjoyed this book and recommend it for the casual reader and the ethicist alike."
5,One of her best!,"If you have never read a Picoult novel this is a good one to start with. Her story of a family dealing with the illness of one child is moving, and a testament to holding on the what you have right in front of you. If you are just looking for a good book to read or a fabulous new author to start this is the book and this is the author. But be warned... reading a Picoult book is addictive and I have given this book to my mom and both my sisters."
2,Twenty Four Hankie Book,"I rented this book on CD from my local library so I could listen to it in the car. BIG mistake. It's really hard to see where you're going when you're sobbing. I can't tell you how many times I gasped at the twists and turns. Overall, it was a good book, but the ending was horrible. I'm more of the happy ending type of gal."
5,My Sister's Keeper the best Book I've read in a long time!!!,This is the best book I have read in a long time... yes we all wish for happy endings but that doesn't always happens and this book deserves 10 stars not 5! The only warning would be to makes ure you have a box of kleenex and make sure you are on vacation because you will not be able to put it down! Thumbs up to Jodi!
4,Makes you aware,Makes you aware of some of the medical miracles happening in this country.I passed this on to my daughter as she is a special teacher.
5,Page turner,Fabulous story that not only was entertaining but thought provoking as well. Deftly told with not alot of vulgarity nor sexual content. something a teen could read comfortably. Brings to the forefront todays medical issues vs moral correctness. Highly recommended.
5,Better than expected!,"I recently read ""Nineteen Minutes,"" and really enjoyed the book...and the unexpected ending. Considering how much I liked it I decided to try this one. I have to say I thought long and hard about the title, and the meaning of the book while reading. I was sure I would be able to sum up the ending. Finally, about 100 pages left in the book I ""had it."" I knew where the book was going and I think I was more excited I figured it out before the ending was revealed. Then...wham...a totally unexpected ""thing"" happens and it was nothing I could have ever prepared for in an ending. I hope all Picoult's books are this amazing, because I think she's found a new fan! Her books are so envolved and require the reader to step back and look at the whole picture...sometimes...it's pretty tough!"
3,engrossing but then disappointing,"I started this book yesterday morning and just finished it this evening. When I wasn't reading the book, I was constantly wondering about the characters and what would happen next. I don't know that the writing style was incredible, but the style varied from character to character; I found myself sympathizing with Jesse and Brian, and disliking Sara. And the plot certainly held my interest. But then the ending. :-/ Oh, the ending... I mean, yeah, the book is fiction so it's not true, but the ending was just this weird little package that seemed to tie up all the loose ends in a totally unsatisfying way."
5,best book ive read,"Being in 8th grade, i was 'forced' to read this book for my class. I wasnt expecting a lot from this book. But once i read it I couldnt put it down. The story rocked me to the core, its emotionally gripping as you go through a mind of a 13 year old trying to make the most difficult decison of her life. Whether or not to donate a kidney to her sister. The very topic stir dicusions between me and my friends. The ending made me cry as your heart breaks for the family. I reccomend this book to everyone. You will not regret it"
3,"Decent, but not her best.","This was certainly worth reading; however, I don't think it was her best. It had gotten a lot of attention so I read it because I liked her other books so much. It is a very complex issue and even through the end I wasn't sure what I thought was best and I think that is a feat of Picoult's to be able to write a novel without swaying the reader too much one way or another. However, I just thought that it was a little slow and it didn't keep my interest as much as the others. I certainly wanted to read it all the way through, but I even while I was reading it I was thinking ahead to other books."
3,Why was i Born?,"The controversial story that was brought about in ""My Sister's Keeper"" made it a wonder to read. The chapters and views of each person in the story made reading the book go by smoothly. This was a touching book and very deep full of drama and pain. The family within the story tries to keep itself together through tough times. The book gets progesivley better as you read it. It was a well written book with a unique story line, but a little too depressing in my opinion."
5,Super book,This was a wonderful book. I devouered it in two days. I really enjoy Ms. Picoult's writing and this was no exception.This book will keep you in suspense until the the breathe-catching end.
2,Foul Language Warning,"I absolutley loved the storyline of this book. It really made you think about what you would do in this situation. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish the book due to the intensity of the foul language. I tried several times to just get through hoping that would be the last of it, but it just continues so much that I finally had to put the book away. It saddens me that this kind of language has to be present in books. I wish there were warning labels like there are on music that contains explicit language."
1,I really am disappointed in this book,"SPOILER.I have decided that Jodi hates mothers, especially those who parent in difficult situations. She demonizes them, and makes them to be pretty much evil. The other characters are little martyrs to their mothers demands and become self destructive. This is not in just this book but in several of her books. They follow a theme 1.sick kid 2.awful mother 3.passive all along but suddenly stands up for himself father 4.siblings of sick kid who want to self destruct/hurt themselves. 5.lawsuit 6.win lawsuit 7.kill a main character. I just seriously roll my eyes in disgust at her deciding that she really dislikes people who fight for their rights, and especially dislikes women."
5,the best book I've read in a long time,Finally a good book. An interesting topic. You feel you know and understand the characters. Surprising ending. I loved it even though I cried and cried at the end.
2,life,"To me this book was boring the way it was written and a little bit confusing, until it got closer to the end. I actually began enjoying it about half way through the book. What I really enjoyed was the ending. It definetely had an ending in the book that you would not expect. Looking forward to seeing the movie. I would give it 3 stars instead of my orginal 2."
2,"Good, not great until the end. Then it crashed",I initially enjoyed the book but the end fell so flat that I really cannot recommend it. What a disappointment. The book raises interesting ethical issues.
5,Quietly challenges your own ideas & values,"I enjoyed how the book challenged my ideas about life and treatments for serious illness without ever feeling pressured into one conclusion. Unlike some other reviewers, I loved that Picoult added some twists that were truly unexpected because -- that's life (and death). I am grateful for this book."
3,Missing Pages,"The book was great. However, I bought used and there were a couple pages missing right in the middle of it."
2,Could not Finish,"I read half of the book and could not finish it, it was just to sad and depressing. This was about 4 months ago, still have not picked it back up."
3,Too Sad to finish,"I really enjoyed the book, but it was too sad to finish. I tried 3 times but couldn't. I do enjoy how the books switches each chapter to a different perspective of each character. I may try one more time to finish it, but the last chapter i read had me crying my eyes out."
1,This book is not worth the paper it is written on,"When I go to a book that gives details about an Operating System, I expect more than I can find in the built in help. This book contained too many errors, was incomplete in areas that most people would be looking for, and is in my opinion a waste of not only money, but time. I deserve a refund for this. Stick to Mark Minasi for titles like this, you will rarely be disappointed."
3,Faithfully But Dissapointed!!,"A simple CD-single which contained the original version, an instrumental version plus the remix / mix version of the original format. The song itself contained a mediocre/average lyrics though interestly it has a little twist on a very sober instrumental you would enjoy or as I did, dislike all alone on the Instrumental version.The Tony Moran Edit is way too weak and I'm not surprisedat all the song is as weak that I can dance too. The depressing lyrics isn't very joyful at all. The video has nice look and it'd be enjoyable but I got tired of it on the overplay for channels such as MTV or BET. Now the single is nice, I got it cuz I had the S.O.S. one and really enjoyed. This one is far beyond and still demostrate that Rihanna has a lot to evolved as an artist or as a truly performer."
1,this is disgusting,"This is disgusting nonsense and I am beyond angry that amazon would allow something as psychotic and evil as this garbage on their website, you should be ashamed of yourself amazon."
1,Literary?,"""Maxine is alone eating eggs. She has her favorite tape on low, the voice of Waylon Jennings just humming. She swings one cowboy boot in hard happy circles. 'Mmmmmmmmm,' she hums along."" This a ""manipulation of the English language"" that should guarantee Carolyn Chute a position in the forefront of literary achievement? I think not. Her affected unpretentiousness in presenting her downbeat characters in economically wrecked western Maine is excruciatingly boring reading. The self-consciously folksy style brings the Letourneaus and the Babbidge's off as a crew of loutish oafs who, like the characters in ""Tobacco Road,"" sit around in their shacks, crowded with wives, husbands, ex-wives, step-children, half-sisters and -brothers, cousins, uncles, doing almost nothing except occasionally shooting each other's guard dogs and lamenting the depreciation of land value. It's labor trying to plough through a narrative in which nothing happens and most details seem random and aimless."
4,Pretty Cool!,"Now,I know everyone loves to say they hate Britney Spears, but i think everyone, at least once, had a time where the liked one of her songs. Boys is a okay single. i recommend just downloading it, instead of buying it though. the remix is better then the original, but the orignal is pretty good too, if you listen to it for awhile."
5,Boys will be boys when it comes to Britney!,"The CO-ED Remix of Boys is one of Britney's best songs to date. A super-slick bassline supplied with a perky, groovy overtone is the focus of this smash-hit. It only peaked at No.7 in the UK, probably because of little radio airplay and/or promotion. The lyrics are bound to cause controversy among many people as Britney toys with sexuality and provocative moves. The remix by one of the members of super-cool The Neptunes who produced the track along with I'm A Slave 4 U, is also very catchy and cool, ""I'm from N.E.R.D. - aren't you Britney?"" he coos while Britney giggles in the background.Britney also appears in Austin Powers III: Goldmember performing this song while Mike Myers decided to appear in the video for Boys. The video takes place in a castle with lots of greenery and zebras! Britney's saucy black outfit is stunning as is Britney. This remix is much better than the album version and is more up-beat."
1,How can a book be less useful than its predecessor??,"I've owned the previous version of this book for years. I was hopeful. The TOC you can read online indicated that the book had grown with the industry. This edition includes more space dedicated to user scenarios, collaboration, topic-based authoring, content management, and localization. And yet the book has less to say than the previous edition. Gone are almost all of the concrete examples and practical advice. The ""best practices"" that are sprinkled throughout the book are rarely more than platitudes or admonishments that you should do something, but the tools to do it are missing. I suspect that the book is really more interested in advocating for Hackos's consulting business than in providing value for your money. Buy the 1994 edition. You'll get more out of it."
2,Mediocre Quality On This DVD,"Don't let the fancy package fool you. I should have known better - the price was so low I thought I'd found a bargain. Unfortunately the prints of both these Hope movies on this particular DVD are mediocre at best. The biggest disappointment was with ""Brunette"" - using a public domain release from CNF (I think I recall that correctly), it doesn't even have the original Paramount logo at the beginning. The print is fuzzy, the sound fair. ""Bali"" fares a little better, but you could do better elsewhere. Pay the right price, get the better quality. I have yet to see a pristine copy of ""My Favorite Brunette"" - if anyone knows of one, let me know! Once again, buyer beware!"
2,Too small for my car seat,The picture of this product is deceiving. The actual cover is too narrow and too short to cover my car seat adequately. The beads are not as polished as those of the cover I had several years ago. And I just saw Walmart is selling a very similar seat cover for under $9. It was returned.
1,To many errors!!!,Too much topics are not covered.I was disappointed by this book. Too much subject are tackled but not deeply. It is just an overview that takes 21 days.
1,Bad book.,"The writer keeps declaring variables as one name and using different variables names further down in the examples. I found improper use of curly braces, and upon showing this to the publisher by email, he offered to refund me whatever I paid. He didn't respond when I took him up on it. Big surprise."
2,A lesson in Frustration,"This was the first Java book I bought. Once I realized that the book was incredibly buggy and that it wasn't me screwing something up, I was able to learn a small bit about Java (just because I had to go digging in another manual to find out why my applets didn't work after following the examples). In a nut shell, this book taught me how bad Visual J++ is. I was determine to stick with Microsoft products but I just couldn't stands no more."
5,Excellent !,"2 words to describe this album - Excellent ! ... An amazing album from start to finish ... No album filler or average tracks here, something you rarely find these days... Heard of them through mp3.com and was delighted when I finally got my hands on a copy of Lifesize. Expect to hear a lot more from these guys in the future."
2,Big disappointment,"I have been buying Market Spice tea for years, and still believe it is the best tasting tea. But I was hugely disappointed with my last order. The tea was dried out and weak. It used to be that you could make two strong cups of tea with one tea bag. In the newest batch, one tea bag would only make a single weak cup of tea. If I wanted to get the full Market Spice flavor I have come to love in the past, I had to steep the tea for about 5 minutes in a smallish cup."
3,"Good Courtroom Drama, Not a Noir","I bought this disc hoping that the film would be a true Film- Noir. It is not. It is an acceptable courtroom drama of the early fifties but it has few Noir elements to make it appeal to a modern viewer. It seems rather simplistic for an Elia Kazan film. Those looking for a Kazan Noir should check out ""Panic in the Streets"" with its beautiful photography and Jack Palance's raw energy, or ""On the Waterfront"" with Brando and Steiger and Cobb showing what acting is all about.A better Dana Andrews film for Noir fans would be Otto Preminger's ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" in which Dana Andrews plays a violent cop who goes a bit too far and kills a suspect. His efforts to conceal his crime make for a film with much dark appeal. While the film is rather brightly lit for a Noir, the mood is quite dark."
5,Just joyful and fun!,"A fantastic book for the self-bossers, for anyone who is a freelancer, entrepreneurial, home based.Barbara's creative and inspiring ideas will fire you up and you won't stop.Read carefully, make notes of every single tip, suggestion or comment you find. You never know, you will give birth to your new small venture! Learn how to survive on spaghetti days, market on a shoestring and make your dreams reality.You can apply these principles to larger businesses, this is fun too.By Thei Zervaki..."
5,An easy read with practical solutions and excersices.,This book is written in such a way that it applies to everyone looking for this solution. And it gives very easy excersices to help you think and figure out 'your' living.
2,Yadda! Yadda! Yadda!,"Same old, Same old. Nothing new here. Every bit of information in this book can be found in every other book of the same topic."
3,For those who condem Contempt Prior to Investigation,"I have not read the book and saw some of the negative remarks. Anyone that finds something that helps them to achieve their dreams stated a way that makes since to others has to be good even if I do not like it. There are 2 types of people today 1 Those that are ""Tiptoeing through life hoping to make it safely to death"" or ""Sold their soul to the corporate world"" number 2. ""Those of us that are willing to take the risk to try anything"" even if there are quotes from others. I am one of those that dances in the moonlight with the stars or lets the wind in my sails guide be to new ports of thought or inspiration. Again those that want to condem ""Get a Life"" those that find something positive take that step off the cliff and soar with the Eagles and have a nice flight."
4,UN-EXPLORED TERRITORY,Phew.. I doubt if I will ever find all the functions on this fine instrument.. it seems to take and play everything I can throw at it... and very nicely... nice style and design.. slim... kinda matches the dvr cable box.. only point of confusion.. the rear panel is sooooo thin there is not room for labeling the connectors.. and the COAX dig audio out ... well you figgure it out.. less than intuitive.. I would give this 5 stars but have not explored all the functions YET>..In my dream world I would like to see... all DVD players this thin and the same size as all the DVD & Cable boxes so they would stack nicely.. and spacer feet for the top and bottom to allow for air flow...
4,Dance like Shakira,"I did this video, and throughout it I thought, man I can learn to dance like Shakira! Unfortunately, I have 2 left feet, and I did ok on parts of it until they incorporated the hand movements, and then I was lost. It was a lot of fun though, and I feel compelled to keep doing it just to learn the dance! The only thing I would want is a little more instruction on what to do with your feet on certain moves, and the camera angles at times makes it hard to see what they are doing. Very fun workout though, and I can see myself doing it a lot!"
5,Alternative to sit-ups,I can't stand sit-ups. They are boring and make my back hurt from rolling on the floor. This video is wonderful for people like me. I get all the benefits from sit-ups while having fun! It also is a wonderful workout for the thighs and butt. I also always wanted to learn Tahitian dancing so this video was a perfect find. I love it so much I'm willing to invest in some of the other Island Girl videos.
2,Not great,"Didn't love this workout. The instructor is somewhat annoying. We tried this the first time in a group - we had a good time laughing, but as far as a workout goes, not so great.To be fair, we were probably not doing the techniques 100%correctly, and it probably takes a bit of practise to get the techniques right and obtain the full benefit of the workout.I give it points for being different, and I will probably try it again on my own sometime."
3,Off Beat Cardio,"The dance moves are easy to follow, the percussion background is fun, but there are parts of the workout that are completely off beat, i.e. the movements don't match the drum beats and skip a beat, and this happens at least twice and bugs the hell out of me.Cool down segment is nice, and all in all I like the DVD but would use it more often it weren't for the annoying off-beat parts!"
5,Absolutely the best,"I bought this book when a friend of mine (no mean cook himself) advised me to try it. Every recipe that I have tried works beautifully. This is one book anyone looking to make Indian food MUST have. Our gastronomical experience took a whole new direction with this work of art.I like the format where each process is explained in a lucid manner. Nothing is difficult when you have this in the kitchen.To gather recipies from all over India is extremely difficult by itself, to do it in one book is a hard one to beat.I have loved every moment of owning this book."
5,Beyond Category,"SonicWaveLove asserts itself as very textured album: probing lyrics, brass back-beats, and gothic bass-lines. ""Satisfied"" provides alot of energy for first track, whereas ""Big Top"" catches us off-guard with tender lyrics and understated percussion.The Cutter's main strength, in my opinion, is their strong sense of structure. The package is tight, guys! Wilhoit has equal mastery of the apprehensive high-hat and the agressive bad-boy drumming. Maki's keyboard and eclectic sampling enhances the harmony without calling attention to itself. Calder and Berry work well as a front line, and add much pathos to a very technical showcase.These guys are hard to peg, but to be ""beyond category"" was Duke Ellington's highest compliment to musicians. I agree. The tracks are very fresh, and worth the second listen."
2,Disappointing,"I have been a HUGE howard fan for years and anxiously awaited the release of this novel. While the premise is compelling, the story just seems to amble along with predictability. There is little or no chemistry/romance between the two lead characters and the relationship never seems to gel. In fact, I never seemed to connect with James Diaz, the male lead.I was also very dissappointed with the ending - instead of building up to an explosive climax it just puttered out, giving the reader no satisfaction.Next to her other books, this one pales in comparison. I would recommend buying other classics such as Dream Man and Kill and Tell."
5,This one is my favorite!,"I love this book! I have already read it over 4 times now, and I still come back again and again to re-read it. I love Milla, and how strong she is after her son is stolen, her dedication to finding him. And I think Diaz complments her character so well. This is a gripping book that is impossible to put down once you've started it, and I mean that even when I've already read it once or twice. I STILL can't put it down! Linda Howard grabs your heartsrings at the very beginning and pulls them along throughout the whole book, and at the end you're bawling. Trust me, I've cried buckets over this book. Here's my advice, go buy this book and keep it close to you...you'll want to read it again. ENJOY!!"
2,It's not unabridged,"I read the book and then I got the unabridged audiobook.The last chapter is not there. The book is great, but itneeds the last chapter. I would not buy this audiobookagain."
3,Good Product but doesn't fit,"As you would expect the K&N filter is a very high quality filter with a limited 1,000,000 mile warranty. The filter is the right length and fits my Buell but it is the wrong fitting for the stock intake. The item is the correct filter for the Buell Blast but the folks at K&N need to make a smaller fitting for the filter to stay put. If you buy one expect it to float around over the fitting on your stock intake and make sure your cover is on tight to hold it in place."
5,LIVING IN THE PRESENCE!,"I have several other books about Celtic Christianity including prayers from these deeply spiritual believers! However I cannot tuck any of those other books into my pocket or pocketbook to carry around with me and pull it out at will to ""douse"" my spirit with renewed awareness of God's presence any where I might be. Although any believer knows that God is everywhere, that knowledge is stirred in a new way in our consciousness when we read Celtic Prayers! Through its invocations, prayers, blessings, etc., this book is not only a ready resource, it also provides that comforting awareness of God's presence which just might set your spirit dancing! It communicates the joy of knowing God that is always present in ever gentle, loving, kind, and protective ways! This book is a treasure to keep close by. It is a boost to one's faith as it's lived day by day . . . even moment by moment!"
3,Safer way to lance chestnuts,"This device provides a much safer way to lance the skin of chestnuts before roasting. It could use more leverage, however, the short handles require more effort than my wife can exert and therefore I get the job of breaking the skin."
5,The Runaway Pumpkin Rolls Over With Delight,"I get a kick out of this tasty Halloween treat. The three Baxter children happen upon a huge pumpkin and the boy Baxters promptly try to remove the pumpkin from its perch.The pumpkin rolls down a hill and right through town.Round and 'round across the groundMakin a thumpin' bumpin' soundCame that thumpety bumpety thumpin' bumpin'Round and Rolly Runaway PumpkinThe pumpkin knocks over Momma Baxter and Grandpa Baxter. It is just about to mow down Poppa Baxter when Dad comes up with an idea to make a pumpkin bed and cleverly catches the pumpkin.Throughout the story, each Baxter family member has designs on things they would like to do or make with a pumpkin (pumpkin pie, pumpkin bread, pumpkin soup). In the end, Grandma Baxter makes all of the family members favorite pumpkin recipe and the centerpiece contains the rest of the huge pumpkin, nicely carved into a jack-o-lantern."
5,I second that....,"These were my first Concerti Grossi on CD. I have, at last count, about 5 different versions. I really thought the Harmonia Mundi set with Ensemble 415 would supplant this one, but it is not recorded well, and sounds very muddy. I love the new version of Op. 6 selections with THE NEW DUTCH ACADEMY - they are glorious, but NOT a complete recording of Op. 6.This version has become my ""go to"" standard: so beautifully performed and recorded. I love the large sound of this version and the NEW DUTCH group - as these concerti were performed with very large (for the day) forces on grand occaisions. One wishes a group known as ""L'aura Soave"" from Italy who are on YouTube would record these. I highly recommend these, and heartily second the previous reviewer's accolades."
3,Vocabulary for Achievement 4th Course,"This Vocab book is usefull and some of its exercises do help the student to memmorize the information. But, some of the examples and Reading Comprehension articles are out dated, seeing as the book hasn't been updated in 13 years. Also, the grouping of asignments to make them better fit do make it more difficult to take tests as the words highly similar. But overall its not really that bad. I've found myself using and reading alot of the words I've learned from this Vocabulary book."
2,"The Original ""One Hand On/Off"" CMG Infinity Ultra is more practical.","The Original ""One Hand On/Off"" Infinity Ultra by CMG is more practical. You turn it on and off with a simple twist of the front bezel, which requires only the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Great for carrying in the pocket and pulling it out and turning it on in one movement. It is a unique product and was provided to our military. The original CMG model was modified by Gerber after buying out CMG, to open with the rear twist, which is like many other brands on the market. Nothing like the Original CMG Ultra. It cannot be turned on easily with one hand. In an emergency, and frankly anytime, I much prefer having a model that can be activated with one hand."
5,"Awesome concept, profound literary achievement","For non sci-fi readers, to put science fiction in the literary category may be a stretch and yet with this book, Mary Staton takes the reader to such profound depths of insight and appreciation for the possibilities of the language that the reader sits there stunned by the words on the page. In almost 40 years of reading this genre I have yet to see its equal. You have to think about the possibility of raising evolution another notch via ""liquid information"" and you have to ponder the great love each mentor has for his/her protege to begin to appreciate Staton's ideas. This is one definitely not to miss."
5,Geography Bee Preparation,"My son enjoyed answering the 1001 questions in The Geography Bee Complete Preparation Handbook. The author explained how the Geography Bee works, and he included study tips and reference information. The questions were grouped into different categories with different levels of difficulty to make it easier to study. Even though this book was published several years ago, it is still relevant, easy to use, and helpful. Highly recommended for studying for The Geography Bee or for students who enjoy geography facts and learning about the world."
2,AHA One-Dish Meals,"The recipes in the American Heart Association One-Dish Meals may be good for your heart, but they generally are not so good to your tongue. Too many use the same root vegetables, i.e., carrots, potatoes, and onions. The result is that many of the dishes taste very similar. Another drawback is that the reason to cook one dish meals is to minimize clean up, which the directions do not lend themselves to."
5,Informative book full of FACTS,"This book basically dispells all the talk of weakness, in reference to Ameica, that we hear these days. The beginning is a little slow, but once you get into the topic chapters it becomes more interesting.The authors point out that terrorism is a tactic. President Bush just started mentioning this in the last few months. However, the book has been out for a while.The book is very good for international relations and political science folks. It is a very good book to pull facts out for your papers, research, and general education on the subject."
1,State Standard is a mess!,I ordered this product with the intention of checking my 7th graders progress this year and seeing what he needed to review for the summer. This product is a MESS! The answers are wrong on many of the questions confirmed by my sons tutor and the company itself. The company has offered us a full refund on the product. It is obvious there are problems that need to be fixed and the company acknowledges this! Don't waste your money!
5,Techniques guaranteed to produce flawless lighting effects,"Bill Hurter's The Best Of Photographic Lighting: Techniques And Images For Digital Photographers is a winner: it provides pros with techniques guaranteed to produce flawless lighting effects, helping photographers understanding the science of light, how it affects photography results, and how to make the most of both studio and location shots. The photos are truly stunning - and the explanations on options and how they were sifted to gain superior results is educational and very specific."
5,Let's HOLLA HOLLA for Ja Rule,"Even for a single CD, this is still excellent. The instrumental of ""Holla Holla"" was excellent as well as the street version. I liked ""It's Murda"" street version but I didn't like the instrumental that good. If you want to just pick a CD up, make sure it's Ja Rule's single CD ""Holla Holla."" Peace."
4,Very Totally Kool!,"Yo Dudes! You know what : Ja Rule does rule - it is so totally good song. I only give four star because I can rap better than Mr.Rule (five smokin' star when I finish most illest tape). Life for us is most whack and hard here during democratization and it so totally difficult to check out da kool rap music from america - only in da black market I get Ja Rule and other blazing rap MCs like Vanilla Ice, Ice-T and Marky Mark. Piece out to Ja and homies in America who I am sure anxiously await my hip-fly talent in rap music (MC Mikey - ""Da Red Hood""). See you on dance floor dudes!"
3,Venni Vetti Vecci,"Anybody want to buy a copy of Venni Vetti Vecci? mail superduo@hotmail.com just put the e-mail's topic as ""Ja Rule"""
4,Unexpectedly good and little heard repertoire,Most of these pieces are not familiar but all of them show originality and well repay listening. The performances are outstanding and the sound quality is high. Definitely a disk to seek out if you have an interest in high quality repertoire that somehow has not found its way into regular performance.
2,Jennifer Love Hewitt is Beautiful--thats all!,"For fans of Jennifer, this is a ok movie but it lacks depth in its characters. This is a TV Movie from Lifetime and it is cut so much it seems that it is not really much effort to talk about prositution. This movie would need to be redone the right way and given a R rating to really tell the story. Watched it once and now I have forgotten about it. Jennifer is a beauty though."
1,Client list,I got wrong DVD I was looking for tv series I got was movie don't know y I need a tv series
5,Real,Finally. A Movie/TV show that is not afraid to be stripped away and leave people feeling naked. This is a perfect show because it shows how a mother goes all the way to save her family. A must see for everyone!
4,Perfect for the kids,"This book is great. It is small enough for my older children to hold and look through, yet it still holds a lot of very memorable information."
5,awesome album,"This is an extremely enjoyable album. I found the band on Pandora from a playlist that started with TV on the Radio, but they are poppier and more electronic. There are also some influences from Modest Mouse and Beta Band. If you like those groups, this is group is fun and more accessible--I loved it on the first listen."
5,GOD IS GREAT EVER CHRISTIAN SHOULD READ,A GREAT CHRISTIAN PROUD TO LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE HE WAS RAISED RT 4 LIBERTY MISSISSIPPI UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
5,Jerry Clower,"Very good book, especially if you are somewhat familiar with Jerry Clower's jokes and style of southern upbringing and stories. The begining will be somewhat slow for those not familar with the man, but the middle of the bookhas very good insights into an authentic Christian way of life. A lot of common sense of how a Christian should be living and thinking about some things. Jerry Clower was a country comedian similar to Jeff Foxworthy and won most comedy awards before Ray Stevens came onto the scene."
4,fight movie,"this movie was around 6-8 yrs ago and i watched it a few times then in went off the shelves at the video shops about 4yrs ago until i came across it at amazon and brought it stragiht away and am very very pleaseed that i did because its 1 of my fav movies,this is a great company to deal with and i will be buying more in the future"
5,"great purchase, good deal, very pleased",This was a outstanding purchase. Movie was great and in perfect condition. Would definately do business again. 5 stars grade a+ across the boards. Thank You!
1,Soundkase iPod clip,"Don't waste your $$. The iPod slips right out of this case. The lip it sits on is not even level, but slanted, and unless you have your iPod packed in a fat cover, you'll lose it."
2,I wouldn't buy this again,"Twenty-five years ago, I got a set of Revere Ware pots that I still use but that are getting a little ""long in the tooth."" A few years ago I looked for some replacements but couldn't find Revere anywhere. So I was excited to recently see this set on Amazon, and I bought it. However, whereas the old Revere was made of high grade (18/8 or 18/10) stainless steel, this set is not. Given that, I don't think it's worth the price. For a comparable price, you can get ""classic"" Farberware pots, which are still made of 18/10. It's sad, though, because I much prefer the flat lid knobs on Revere, which prevent the lid from rolling around when you put it on the counter during cooking. Perhaps Farberware could buy the rights to the Revere design..."
4,A most excellant book,This book is full of musical plays and the scripts are worded well for possible performance. The only problem is that the sheet music is missing and from experience it is a headache to find but other than that it is a good book that stimulates the imagination.
5,Unbelieveable,"Lou Gehrig died in 1942. So little change, so much misery. This film puts the problem in focus yet how valuable human life can be, even with such a horrible, debilatating disease can be. I hope it helps to shame drug companies to finally mobilize on this disease and for the public to demand it. Obviously, the public opening their wallets will help too."
2,nice but not much helpful content,"There were some good points in this book, but much I found vague and unhelpful."
5,A book all fathers should read,"Because I am a stay-at-home father, the title, Fatherstyle Advantage, caught my eye. When I discovered one of the authors, Kevin O'Shea, was also a stay-at-home dad, I decided to read the book.Having a dad who didn't have a clue about how to raise children, I have always felt the role of the father is critical. And that is not to take anything away from moms. I found the book full of good suggestions. It's made me think critically about my fathering skills, and I think improve them.Men, fortunately, are spending more time with their children. The authors' advice makes that time more meaningful and enjoyable.Thank you James Windell and Kevin O'Shea for taking the time to share your ideas with others."
5,Kickin',This is a great case that you must have! You have nothing if you don't have this case. Get it now!!!
2,"Flimsy, unstable stool.","I was excited to get this stool, I love the retro style. I needed something strong and sturdy that I could use in the kitchen to reach high shelves and sit on while chopping veggies. I'm returning this one, it doesn't seem stable. If anyone large were to sit on it, I feel it wouldn't support them. Also, the assembly was really easy, but certain parts just didn't stay connected. I'm going to research to find a better one."
4,Difficult assembly,"The chair itself is great, but assembling it is extremely difficult without a workbench, an item not found in many city apartments. The instructions are OK but need to be read very, very carefully. You're going to need Phillips-head screw drivers of varying lengths, wrist strength, and a fair amount of time. I would have preferred and been willing to pay for the option of the stool being shipped fully assembled."
2,short and not the best,"This CHAIR is fine if you would like a small step stool with a chair. I though that it would have been stool height, as it appears taller in the photo and the word stool misled me. The quality is OK, but not the best. If you are looking for an inexpensive chair with a step to reach top shelves, then this is probably fine."
1,"Dangerous, Flimsy, Manufactured poorly","The marketing of this chair is nice, that's it, don't be fooled. When it arrives prepare for considerable ""assembly required"". Several pieces had to be modified by bending the openings wider to allow the screws to go through. The chair is much smaller than the picture portrays and the legs are uneven. I would not let any children or elderly use this product. It is poorly manufactured, flimsy, and dangerous. Hard to return after you spent an hour putting it together. It now becomes ""garage furniture""."
1,Cosco Quality Questionable,"Bought this as a gift for my mother..unfortunately, never was able to give it to her. When my husband attempted to assemble it, he found the hole on one leg was stripped out. He callead customer service (on hold for 30 mins) and described the problem. They promised to replace the defective leg....but,never did. A month after waiting for the part, he sent an email to their customer service address with detailed info regarding the defective part...after 3 weeks still no word or replacement. Amazon is sending return label...will be glad to have the parts and box out of my living room!!Cosco you can do better than this!"
4,alot of work,"The chair is very well made but the step could have been a little more wider. The instructions are very well written with illustrations. But, there was alot of screws and bolts that had to be used in assembly and were sometimes hard to reach with a screwdriver."
2,omg,it was very hard to put together so well i gess if you dont like beybladeing you can git as a thaing that you put on you dresser
1,BUYER BEWARE,"It's been a month since this item was first ""shipped"" I still have not recieved the products. I've inquired about it twice and was told it was in the mail. I understand that shipping may take some time from the UK to the states....but maybe you shouldn't be selling items to people that live in the US?Yes, at this point I'm upset, these were to be Christmas peasants. I thought that by ordering on Dec. 1st I would be safe. I was wrong, buyer beware."
2,Needs 13 months!,I can't even put her 1st birthday on the calendar because it only has 12 pages of months to record on.
2,Not enough stickers. Ran out of months.,"I wasn't really happy with this product. I had a better one for my first baby, wish I could have found that instead of this one.First Problem: This one only had 12 months. (the one for my son had 13 months). So unless your child is born on the first of the month, this is a problem. I started on July 15th and it ended in June. So we missed the last 15 days of her first year.Second Problem: There weren't very many stickers. The one I got for my first baby had everything you could think of. This one had only the basics. I feel bad becuase we can look back and see more of what he did.I would not recommend this product unless you're looking for something REALLY basic."
2,Pull tab broke on third use,"My daughter really likes this timer, but the metal pull tab on the end of the tape broke off the third time we used it. It's so inexpensive I'm going to just find a way to fasten it back on rather than bothering to return it, but if anything else breaks it will go straight in the trash and I'll find another company to buy a different timer from. I wouldn't buy this one again."
1,"Bad Luck, maybe...","Recommend you ""do not buy"" this item. We've used turbo-cookers for many years with very good results. This model worked for about 10 minutes before the convection fan / heater stopped working. Thinking the fan/heat may cycle on and off we waited for 30 minutes before unplugging the unit. Let it rest overnight to no avail. Once burned is enough for us. Glad we bought it via Amazon...otherwise this could have been a headache."
1,Get the Nuwave oven instead.,"Saw Mr.T's infomercial for Nuwave tabletop oven & it looked good. I comparison shopped and found this similar Sunpentown cost less. So I bought the Sunpentown and it sucks, not cooking food through even after extended cooking time. The Nuwave has 3 heating methods: conduction, convection, & infrared (radiant). Sunpentown only has two, conduction & convection, without the infrared radiant heat which makes tabletop ovens superb. I tossed my Sunpentown and bought a Nuwave, which works excellent! Nuwave makes the very best burgers, steaks, veggies etc. because the infrared heat browns the food like a bbq grill. Also it's quick, easy to clean, doesn't use too much power, and doesn't heat up your kitchen like a range oven. Doesn't smoke up your house like a George Foreman grill either. I should've taken Mr.T's advice from the start."
4,Good book but uses the three finger fret style,"I purchased this book along with several others (Dummies, Idiots, etc) and found this one to offer a quick intro for playing the bass. This is the somewhat infamous three finger book that instructs you to use only three fingers when fretting instead of the more standard four finger style. Still an excellent book."
3,Higher expectations,I'm sorrry to say that I am somewhat disappointed in this book. I have depended on other Hal Leonard books through the years but this one falls short for me. Too much ink is spent on teaching rudiments and basics and not enough on practical playing. I have since moved on to another that suits me better.
5,Pure Fun!,I loved Barry Williams book and this movie was just as great. All of the actors involved really nailed each personality. For anyone who is a die hard Brady fan this is a gift.
5,the brady's,i really enjoyed this dvd thanhkyou very much it5 was really great to see this thanks again i will buy mor dvd from you in the future
3,NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS.,"I purchased The Bride & Groom First and Forever Cookbook and loved it so I decided to try this one. The Bride and Groom's First Cookbook DOESN'T have pictures! The Bride and Groom First and Forever DOES. Because of the pictures in the latter, I felt compelled to try some of the dishes. They were great and have become part of my regular menus. This book, the Bride and Groom First Cookbook, may have several good recipes but it's more apt to end up dusty on the bookcase. I wasn't really pleased with a few of the recipes I read. Actually, they may be a bit to fancy for my taste and really didn't appeal to me. Others may really like them though. I'm just a basic food type of person. I like basic recipes with a little common flare."
5,The Caesar Milan Way,"I purchased this backpack(largebackpack)for our 110 lb. Rottie after reading Caesar's Way, by Caesar Milan. He states that a dog backpack is very useful in giving the dog meaningful work during walks and for instilling a sense of calm. This has worked like a charm for our dog. She is significantly calmer on walks and this makes our outing more pleasant for the whole family. The mountainsmith dogpack is very sturdy and easy to use. It's both worth the money and the extra minute it takes to put on before we start our walk."
4,Medium Size Dog Pack,"So far I like this pack for my 64 pound german sherherd mix. The only thing that is a little misleading is the sizing. This is supposed to be for 40 to 80 pound dogs, I also went to the Mountainsmith website and measured her per their instructions. I have both underneath straps tightened as tight as they will go and the fit is stable like that, so I don't know how this would work on a dog that weights any less than 60 pounds. I think the breast strap is just a little too low on my dog's shoulders but it still works okay. The pack seems to be made well, but we only use it to walk around town so I never put too much in it."
2,Not a good design,"This product is built well and might last a while, but it was not a good fit for my 62 pound labrador mix. I found him bleeding under his underarms every time he wore his backpack. I even when to a pet store to see if they could adjust it for me. They did, but it still didn't work."
2,"Title should be: ""the role of noise in Shannon-Weaver -model","Being a big fan of information, I was very interested in the book. But the contents were a huge disappointment. The writer spends too much time about telling stories of personal relations to the people behind the models, and the role of ""information"" in various parts of the book is lost quite completely.There are, however very interesting and informative (sic) parts of the book. Noise in the Shannon-Weaver -model is described in a way that really tells more about the concept, both in the respect if information theory and everyday life. The effects of noise are brought up in several parts of the book, in various fashions.The book is well-written, and easy to read. But title is misleading, and the contents are quite thin for somebody interested in the subject."
1,A SICK AND IDIOTIC WAY OF LOSING WEIGHT DONT TRY IT,"EVERYONE HERE DON'T THINK OF BUYING THAT CRAP IT'S JUST A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME ,PEOPLE WHO GO ON THIS DIET SUFFER FOR LIFE TIME ,I TRIED IT AND I WAS SUFFERING FROM A DISORDER WITH MY EATING HABITS AND I HAVE VISITED LOTS OF DOCTORS TO CURE MY ILLNESS I BECAME SELF OBSESSED AND AND NEVER KNEW ITS RIGHT FOR ME TO EAT OR NOT ....PLEASE DONT TRY THIS BOOK AT ALL RISKS ITS NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE OF ANY AGE ,JUST BE ON A STABLE DIET AND WELL BALANCED MEALS AND U WILL LOSE WEIGHT ,OR TRY SOMETHING LIKE LOW-FAT DIET OR A PROTEIN DIET EVEN WOULD DO."
3,Good Read..If you have time.,"For those of you who want a quick book fix...this is NOT the book for you. Tropic has a lot of characters, details and information packed into it. For recreational readers this is pretty heavy reading and the Glossary will most likely have to be used. The main character is developed well, but it does take several chapters to get a feel for her and the situations she finds herself in. The writer goes back and forth from past events - via main characters journal - to present events, and it is not always easy to follow or keep you interested. The ending is open and left no closure for the main character. If you have the time this book can be interesting, if you want a light easy read...this is not the book for you."
4,Based on a true story?,"Some reviewers here have called this book ""too far-fetched."" I beg to differ. I enjoyed this book a lot, in part because I believe it to be based on the real-life adventures of anthropologist and spiritual teacher Joan Halifax.The protagonist ""Jane"" experiences such echoes of Joan's real life as her brief marriage to Stanislaw Grof & their shattering personal experiments with the hallucinogenic drug ketamine, and her extensive travels to study paths of wisdom and power, especially cross-cultural shamanism. And Gruber's descriptions of encounters with the spirit realms ring true for me.How fictional is Tropic of Night? Only the author, the spirits, JH (now Roshi) and her close friends likely know. But if you read it with that in mind, its fascination grows like a plant in the Amazon."
5,Excellent Battery Charger,"This product is light weight, portable and so easy to use. Works very well. I would recommend this product to anyone!"
5,Great book if you are having twins,"This is a great book if you are having twins. I read it cover to cover & then certain sections a second time. I really love the ""Roundtable Talk"" where parents of twins discuss a topic. There's nothing like hearing helpful hints & advice from people who have actually have twins. I also found the resource guide in the back of the book very helpful."
3,XM2Go,"I bought the xm2go for mobile use when walking or bike riding. I wanted to have access to live XM while exercising. Unfortunately under such circumstances it gets the worst reception. I like most features about the Inno except it just does not have consistent and reliable reception. If you can be satisfied with just using the Inno when stationary, under good reception circumstances, you will be happy. If you want to use it in transit you may be disappointed. Due to it's poor reception while on the go, I do not believe it is worth it's full retail value."
2,Very oily and overly sweet,"I bought these cookies thinking that the texture would be a nice change to traditional cookies. However, upon baking them according to the directions, they were very oily and crumbly. They also are almost too sweet to eat an entire cookie. I wouldn't buy them again."
2,Not Fascinated,"I really wanted to like this book. The synopsis sounded delightful, and a lot of the writing, per se, was very good. But ... our heroine was soooo annoying, I really had a hard time with the rest of it. And as far as the romance/sensuality ... a lot of teasing, but not much else.Fascination"
2,Fascination,"Didn't really care for this book. I did not like Grace at all, she was without honor. She comes to marry one man for his money and lets another man(not knowing he is the man she is to marry)seduce her after only the second time they had met and so forth. And Arran was no better,knowing Grace was marrying him for his money and was cheating on him (with what Grace thought was another man)(that's what his last wife did to him right;the reason he didn't want to marry again)felt he was falling in love with Grace on the third day. I'm sorry... but what crap! If you like petting and panting after just a few pages, this is the book for you, but if you are like me and like a strong female/male relationship where they actually take some time to know and have respect for each other first, you may want to give this book a pass."
1,"Great shows, horrible transfer!","The actual shows themselves are wonderful! These are the Christmas classics that I grew up with and it's great to watch them anytime you want without the commercials and annoying channel logos. However, the transfer to DVD is absolutely horrible. There is so much film grain and dirt it is at times distracting. You would think that they take these wonderful classics and remaster the video, but no such luck. Still worth the purchase, but I wish they would have done a nicer transfer."
1,awesome,"all of them are great EXCEPT for rudolph.its a horror movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!its scared me so much that i almost fainted.i mean,whats scarer than these HUGE mountains and then some HUGE monster comes out from behind them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and then when rudolph leaves the house and then the monster roars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i mean its scaryer than the twilight zone coming to life!!!!!!!!never NEVER watch at night.i mean it!!!"
1,santa claus is comin to town 3-DVD GIFT COLLEC TION,i ORDERED THISW ITEM AND I ONLY JUST RECEIVED EMTY CASES WITH NO DVD'S IN THEM. I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS WAS DONE INTENTIONALLY OR NOT BUT I SEND BACK THE EMTY CASES AND GOT MY MONEY BACK.
4,good over all,"Everything is pretty good with this. I wish the CD were the original voices, and my copy of frosty had a scratch on it out of the package so it is jumpy at the beginning. But other than that I love getting all of these in one shot."
5,The nastalgia is nice...,"It's nice at Christmas time to be able to pull this out and remember what Christmas was like as a kid. I've got several of the other stop-action movies as well, a worthwhile purchase!"
5,Cute and makes you think,This book is fun to read because it is soooo cute on the inside. There are stories that make you stop and think about shopping. I admit to shopping til I drop. I want to make some changings and the way Amanda Ford explains things in a simple fun way really made me think about what I'm doing.
4,An excellent introduction to the Camino of Santiago,"An inspiring travelogue of the ups and downs of the life of a modern pilgrim. Great reflections on spirituality, religion, modernisation, architecture, and travel in the modern age. Lots of practical tips can be gleaned from his experience of the walk. It was one of the first books I read about the pilgrimage before setting out myself this past fall. Hoinacki taught me that this pilgrimage, although not original, is certainly experienced uniquely by each person who decides one day to just put on a pack and start walking, like he did. He decided that chocolate would be too much of an indulgence for the pilgrim. So he never ate chocolate while he was walking. I did. And lots of it!!P.S. I got my copy at Wide World Books and Maps in Seattle."
4,A great book for the traveller and pilgrim,"This is a great book and is a very useful guide to the pilgrimage. It is hard to find, and Amazon is doing a great service in trying to provide it for pilgrims. However extracts from the book with very useful information can be found at the Telegraph Online London web site in the TRAVEL section. Look search under Yahoo for Telegraph Online and then Browse the many pages and articles on the pilgrimage found under the travel section. The book is fully reviewed in the newspaper's travel pages, the site has many useful useful facts about the pilgrimage including a FAQ"
4,A real page-turner,"Writers hate being compared to other writers, but Shannon and his protagonist, Mick Callahan, made me think of John D. MacDonald and Travis McGee. Callahan is worldly and competent, but he's driven by his own inner demons to get himself about six feet over his head in deep and turbulent waters.Shannon sucks you into the world of Dry Wells, Nevada, and if you're like me, you'll become very impatient with anything that comes between you and your reading.I'm looking forward to many more exciting mysteries from Shannon! I'm withholding a star from MEMORIAL DAY only because I'm confident that Shannon will get even better as time goes by."
5,"Breezy, sorta like Radiohead or My Bloody Valentine","I first heard this band off a Urlich Schnauss album where he had re-mixed one of their songs. They're great. It's traditional layered guitars without too much synth pop. If you like the so-called ""new"" stripped down, ""retro"" 70s stuff, you probably won't like Long-View. If you like Jarvis Cocker, Coldplay or Radiohead, I think you will."
5,Beautiful,This is such a beautiful album. The guitar riffs just draw you in and the melodies just soar. The bands passion comes through in the driving repetitions of the choruses.The lead singer's voice blends in as another instrument in the well balanced sound of this group that is just so beautiful to listen to. I can listen to this album endlessly and often don't even notice when its gone onto repeat!
4,Microwave/Convection Cookbook,This is not a bad book. I wish more of it was devoted to convection cooking. There are only about 30 pages covering convection.The seller was great. Due to some foul up the original order was never received. I emailed the seller who immediately sent out another copy & provided a tracking number. The seller gets 5 stars for customer service.
4,JeanPaul,"Excellent cologne... Still wish they lept the same potency as before, but none of them do so. The spray nosel is giving me trouble may have to exchange if I can't get to work right."
2,Not a durable product,We purchased this unit to heat water for tea on our wood stove. Glass knob self-distructed after the second pot of tea. Glad we are tea drinkers not coffee drinkers or we'd be sunk. The pot rocks back and forth while heating on the wood stove making quite a racket in our quiet little farm house. None of our other tea pots new or old have done this? About ready to retire this 3 month old pot to become the chicken feed scoop.
1,Don't Bother,Orderd this pot & it lasted 32 days before the glass dome cracked & broke from heat. Dealing with Coleman has been quite difficult. Going back to my trusty old Farberware stainless stovetop perc. Thats if I can find one.
1,Received 3 in bad condition,"We really liked the idea that this was stainless steel. First one we received was dented in the spout. Second one, was dented in two places on the bottom. Amazon returns was great and they were reluctant to send us another one but we decided to try for a third one cause we used a credit and would lose out on the credit if an order not placed. So third one came in, no dents however the finish is really questionable and very rough on the top of the pot. We will keep this one but we recommend for the price of this pot and the quality that you get - PASS, PASS, PASS on this product.Update on this: What a terrible product. In order to get it to percolate correctly, you have to make at least a minimum of 10 cups. So no small pot of coffee just a huge pot of coffee. We gave up on this. It just sits in the back of the cupboard."
1,"Disappointed, Not much baby","I was really excited about this workout DVD because I had a baby and I have loved every other Ellen Barrett pilates DVD. I was really disappointed. It's basically telling you where to put your baby while you do some light exercises. You put your baby in the stroller and hold onto it for balance. You put your baby in the baby carrier and you move your arms around. You sit your baby on the mat while you do crunches. I didn't even do the workout--I just previewed the DVD so that I would know what equipment I'd need. I was hoping that I'd use the baby as a weight, so to speak, and that the baby would be incorporate into the vast majority of the exercises. I'll be reselling my copy."
4,Good product,"See I am not too much into changing saddles so not experimented with many.I have this saddle for over 15 months and can tell you that it is good for upright position riding. most people would like a foam or gel saddle because of obvious flexibility .But somehow leather saddle takes the ump cure and make sit bones strong.Spring helps only when you are mountain biking or really up straight, might not so much ion road bike.For road bikes I think B-17 model looks cool :)"
4,My repeat purchase,"This is my replacement watch for the SEIKO that started losing time. I have owned that one for several years. I wanted one that had the same appearance and weight. I was disappointed when the watch arrived that this one is a lot heavier than a similar model that I replaced. Otherwise, these watches are pretty basic in funcationality and look attractive for the price."
4,good collection of essays,"Mason's collection of essays is a wide-ranging and overall pretty good collection of essays. The title essay is sort of a 'literary memoir', and while I expected it to be one of the better essays, it really isn't. But there are some excellent essays on Auden, Tennyson, Frost, Heaney, Louis Simpson, J.V. Cunningham, Anne Xexton, and Irish poetry. And then there are the essays meant to further the cause of the New Formalist movement. They almost sound like propoganda, but they are well written, enjoyable essays that make sense. And my favorite essay is ""Other Lives: On Shorter Narrative Poems."" Mason is a phenomenal narrative poet, and anyone with an interest in narrative poetry should read this essay."
4,Large Shallow Socket,"This was just what I needed for the job I had to do, and it worked just fine. Well priced also."
4,Extra hand makes work a little easier,"So far this little vise has been just what the Dr ordered. It holds the dremel tool securely to my work surface, keeping my hands free to hold the project. It will also hold the project well when the item is too small to hold in my hands. Great item - watch for sales or bonus buys to make this an even better deal."
3,Not reccomended,"These harmonicas play okay; however, if you try to bend them much, they will become out of tune quickly. They are cheaply made. They don't play very loudly. You get what you pay for."
5,Outstanding Book!,"I taught several statistics courses using Statistics: A Gentle Introduction (1st ed.). I just received the 2nd edition. I have shelves of stats books and these are by far the most down to earth, easy to understand stats books I've found and are ideal for teaching. The 2nd edition builds upon the first edition and offers practice problems and sample test questions at the end of each chapter. The 2nd edition includes SPSS output and a description of the output for regression & correlation (but not for ANOVA, t-tests, chi-square). The 2nd edition includes a nice description of confidence intervals. I highly recommend this book!"
5,One of Marilyn Kayes best book in the Replica series,"Amy goes to Paris with her mom and Monica for a whole week. She runs in to a lot of suprises while she is there. At first she thinks that she sees Andy who she met at Wilderness Camp a while ago and who is also a clone, but he runs away at the sight of her face. Finally she sees him at school when she goes to see Annie a clone from the Project Cresent as well. Annie invites Amy and Andy to go to the Catacombs with her but Andy won't go. While at the Catacombs, Amy hears people talking about killing others that arn't perfect. She sees Andy with them and thinks that he is one of them. Later, Amy comes across a situation and she doesn't know how to handle it. Read In Search of Andy to find out all the other mysterious things that go on. If you like the other books in the replica series you are bound to like this one."
3,I EXPECTED IT TO BE A LOT BETTER,"I didn't particularly care for this book. I mean, the whole deal with the neo-Nazis got pretty boring after a while. I knew what side both Annie and Andy were on from the beginning. It was predictable, and it didn't catch my attention that well. I liked the beginning, and the end, but other than that, this book was not that good. I really thought Kaye would do something better."
4,Narrow and Long,"Hefty material, too thick to see clearly through, but you can see through them.The bags are an odd shape being long and narrow."
1,"waste of paper, I returned the book,booring who cares?","this book is no good, waste of time, booring, who cares, never should have been written.zero star"
2,Used Book,"I paid for a new version of this book FROM AMAZON and amazon sent me a worn, used, marked book.BUYERS BEWARE!!!"
3,Used,"When I opened the inner package it was obvious that the monocular had been used and returned. Also I noted the product was made in Russia. Both of these facts should be listed in the ad and the item sold as used versus new. I returned the product and my refund was handled rapidly, as always."
3,The Twins at Ballet,"This is one of the earlier Sweet Valley Twins books, before all the characters have been fully introduced. This is not one of the best Sweet Valley Twins books, namely because of the sisters' interaction with one another. Jessica and Elizabeth are taking ballet classes together, and the big performance is coming up. Elizabeth has a huge part, while Jessica got a small part. Jessica whines and complains like a little child because she didn't make the lead. Finally, after trying to manipulate her sister, and take the easy way out, Elizabeth naively lets her sister play her part. As much as I like the Sweet Valley Twins books, this is not the best one and the sisters' interaction is unrealistic.PS--To all you people who wrote a review about a girl named Nancy, you are thinking of a different book that has the same name. I know the one you mean, and this isn't it. This is in the Sweet Valley Twins series."
2,One of the most boring,"This book is sort of boring, but it's still good. In this book, Jessica and Elizabeth are taking ballet lessons. They both want the part of Swanilda, but only one of them can have the part! When Elizabeth gets the part, Jessica is very angry. Will Elizabeth have to give up her part because of Jessica? Read this book to find out!"
4,A Must Read!,"This book really puts Jessica and Elizabeth's relationship to the test. The twins are taking ballet class. Madame Andre, the instructor, always praises Elizabeth, even though Jessica is 10 times better! It really isn't fair. Madame Andre gives Elizabeth the best role in the recital and Jessica gets the smallest part. ELizabeth finally figures out that Jessica is better, and she comes up with a plan so that Jessica can take the role as beatiful Swanilda.If you are a Sweet Valley fan, this book is a must-read!"
2,Looks like a plastic egg machine ring,"I am reconsidering purchasing anything from Silver Insanity. Some of their silver is quality, some is not, but you won't know until you get it. This entire ring is very thin and the filigree is crooked and I can bend the ring with little effort. However, it was inexpensive and I guess I just got what I paid for."
2,All's well that ends well?,"As with all Curious George stories, I disagree with the generalmoral that this book carries. And that seems to be that all's wellthat ends well, or the end justifies the means. I disagree with this philosophy, and especially think it a bad philosophy to teach young children, who, due to their inexperience and lack of reference, need stricter boundaries than do adults or even adolescents. I give This book 2 stars, instead of just one, due to sentimental reasons, I suppose. Curious George was one of the first set of books I remember that had a little more vivid color than the standard red and black library books of my early youth. END"
5,More Informative than Esthetics Books,"This book is a must-read for anyone suffering from breakouts or who desires to enter the esthetics or dermatology fields. Dr. Fulton has a successful history of treating patients with acne and has done extensive research on the causes and treatment of acne. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about skincare or treating breakouts. I wish I had read this book when I was twelve or thirteen. The wealth of information contained in this book is enough to make someone seem like an expert. Upon reading, one may learn all the myths and truths about acne, and by understanding its cause, may treat it more effectively. As far as I'm concerned, this should be the manual for acne treatment."
3,Average,"I bought this book based on the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. The mystery was good and it was because of this that I continued to read to the end. However, the dialog was exceptionally poor. It was unoriginal and repetitive. In fact, it was so bad that it made Ray appear as if he were developmentally disabled although you know he's not. If you can get past the dialog, it's a good read."
2,Dialogue from hell!,I can't say much for the plot because I was too busy with the eye twitch I got from the stunted dialogue. Getting any information from any of the characters was like pulling teeth. The one sentence answers made me think of reading a Hemingway book. Plus the characters must be morons:Generic Example:Where did you get the car?Car?The one you were driving to the store.Store?Harris Teeters. I saw you coming out with a bag of groceries.Groceries?For the love of all that is holy stop answering a question with another question!!! I almost threw the book across the room!
2,Too convenient,"I've never read Abrahams before, but I thought this novel was kind of lame. So many convenient plot twists that came along just as mechanisms to advance the story did not seem natural (think about Jerry calling Roy out of the blue to make sure that he has not given up the case. HUH?) and so much was useless to the plot and the ending at the farm ... pu-leaze.I've heard good things about Abrahams, so maybe I would try another, but I thought this novel was a real waste of time"
5,almost too great for words,"Im not from DC, so the only way I found out about this band was on the net. I went to the site and listened to some of their stuff and it was great. The album as a whole just fits well. Their sound is something new and different from all the nu garage punk that is popular of late. The title track just blows me away...worth the money and more"
4,Great Transaction,"The textbook I received was exactly as I had ordered it. The best part about this business transaction was the delivery. I received my textbook two business days later, which was great!"
2,Picture rarely matches real item+bad wear,"Watch is good, but when I want blue, I want blue ! Face absolutely reads almost black, way past navy or blue-gray, not like picture at all .... AND after one week of normeal, the bezel surface just rubbed off"
2,inaccurate,"I've owned this watch for about three years now. Since the day I got it has run 5-7 minutes fast a week. I contacted Seiko and they informed me that this was within ""normal"" specs for this model. I Purchased a Wenger Battalion diver and so far its been amazingly accurate, while the Seiko sits in my dresser collecting dust."
4,I Wish I Discovered this Book Years Ago,"My son was diagnosed bipolar with schizo-effective disorder. He has been in and out of hospitals since he was seven. No one was ever able to give me a clear understanding of what was going on with my son or how to deal with him. We pretty much lived our lives waiting for the inevitable blow-ups and cleaning up the messes afterward.Dr. Ross in this book explains how an explosive child isn't being manipulative or malicious when he explodes. He explains how this sort of child just has difficulty in dealing with frustration, and we need to adjust our attitudes to his needs accordingly, just as you would with a child who has a physical difficulty.This view has changed the way I look at my son, and it gives me some hope that if I implement these procedures in dealing with him that with time and work, we'll have a son who handles frustration a great deal better than he does now.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an easily frustrated child."
5,The Explosive Child,"The Explosive Child: A New Approach for Understanding and Parenting Easily Frustrated, Chronically Inflexible ChildrenThis book is an excellent resource for parents. I would even recommend it to all professionals, especially teachers who may deal with these children in the class room. It gave me hope and it let me know that I am not alone."
5,A most useful resource,"I just finished reading this book, one I borrowed from the library. It was so helpful I had to own one. I recommend it highly for parents, teachers, and counselors that deal with regularly with angry children."
5,"Great Book, Big Help!","I loved this book. I have to say I was skeptical at first, as I felt the author was talking down to the reader, however, I was being over sensitive. As the mother of an adhd child, often a person gets over sensitive to percieved criticism when none is really there. Anyway, this book opened a whole new view for me on my child's behavior and the basic reasons behind it. At last I saw why conventional behavior modification (token economies, loss of privileges, etc) didn't work and I saw what would work. I found this book the most helpful thing I've tried in years. I would highly recomend this book to anyone dealing with an explosive child.Higest Marks."
2,Ross Greene repeats himself,"I found that the concepts in this book, while useful, were repeated over and over and over and over. I was turned off by this as were the clients i asked to read it."
4,Very Informative,"This book was very helpful in explaining why 1 out of 3 of my children was so much more difficult to deal with. These are principles we should apply with all our children. It's a better way to deal with others,children and adults, respectfully."
5,This is the only book that helped,"This is the only practical book that i have read on this problem. the solutions are doable and easy.Wish i had 10 copies to hand out to every teacher i have known that have just thought my child was difficult or ""spoilt""."
1,Save your money and time,This book is full of generalities and un-founded beliefs. Save your money and purchase one of the books by Riley on the same subject.
4,Made me feel like I'm not alone!,"This book had some good tips on how to deal with my son, who had been having some explosive tantrums. The best part about the book was that it made me feel like I wasn't the only person on earth with a child who was so easily frustrated."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK,"I would NOT recommend this book AT ALL to ANYONE. They say that a hedgehog needs to be handle WITH gloves which is not okay to do at all. The gloves can mask your scent and cause the hedgehog stress. Also, they say you should keep your hedgehog in about 60-65 degrees which again is NOT true. A hedgehog needs to be in a WARM environment of about 72-80 degrees farenheit. Also, recommending nuts for food.. which is another ""no no"" because the nuts can get stuck on the roof of their mouths which makes for a vet emergency. I really could go on and on...This book was horrible. Horrible information that could kill your hedgehog. Seriously."
1,Undependable,"About one month into owning this product it would shut off or simply stop responding at random. Now after only 4 months it doesn't work at all. I managed to save all my personal photos, but everything else went. Of all computer products, a hard drive should be the most dependable as sometimes it's contents are irreplacable. For that I'm going to have to ignore everything about this except for the fact that it broke after only 4 months of use (4 months without being on for than a couple hours at a time and no dropping/ill treatment)."
2,consider yourself warned,"I was looking for an inexpensive way to store and backup my pictures and music. While this hard drive may be inexpensive I have definitely been dissapointed. The biggest issue I have is with the power cord. While the power cord is securely inserted in the drive it will at the slightest movement loose power. You then have to ""jiggle"" and manipulate the cord to restore power. Of course anything you were using or backing up is lost or ruined. I have replaced this product with a very reliable western digital and use this as a backup for my backup. Just spend the extra money and avoid this less expensive option."
5,Very quiet,"This drive is remarkably quiet. And it's reliable, quick, and everything you need in an external USB drive."
4,EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE FOR A GREAT PRICE!,I have owned this product close to six months now and the storage capacity meets my needs just fine. Easy to install and operate. I recommend it for use as an addition to any computer and for temporary files.
1,"IF IT IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THEN IT ISN""T!!!!",The product worked for three months then suddenly gave me a message saying that the disk needed to be formatted. I am a college student and lost a lot of valuable data! DO NOT BUY CALVARY unless you are willing to risk losing data!!! I think I may have been the first student to say Calvary ate my homework!!!STRIKE CALVARY!!!!!!!!!
4,Gets the Job Done,It is simple to use even without an instruction manual. But who needs more paper to store?
1,Not great,I used this for less than a year before it started giving me trouble. It would make a clicking sound and sometimes it wouldn't show up on the computer. It also started showing a red light which means that something is wrong. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,Works fine but copying is slow,"Hi,This product is OK. I think now a days you can get better ones for less. Comparitively OK product and I suggest go for better option. (Value for Money kinda...)"
4,Very engaging,"This was my favorite of the four in the series. Great character development, astute understanding of incidents that led to independence."
2,Really wanted to like it.,"I was really excited to receive this as I have always wanted one. It came in a box that did not say ""Yukon"", only had NVMT on the box and the unit! The ""owners"" manual also only said NVMT. I know this is the model but it seems a little weird that the only place I found Yukon mentioned was an obscure area in small print in the warranty section! The image is very bright, almost too bright! But I could not get the image to focus beyond 15 ft! The instructions did not mention an eye piece focus or diopter, only the front lens focus. Even when focused, it was very blurry. I returned the item and ordered a Bushnell Equinox. I know it has a eyepiece diopter, and can focus super sharp! Very happy with the Bushnell!"
1,Very disappointed,"This unit failed after just 2 months, plus when it was installed it would read 0 under 3 feet. Would not recommend."
5,Excellent scientific resource - but not for casual horse owner,"As a student of animal behavior and animal welfare, focusing on equine welfare, this book was a MUST for my bookshelf, as it will be for anyone studying animal behavior. While McDonnell gives a lot of great information in the foreward for the lay reader, I believe the ethogram itself would be a bit of a disappointment to the casual horse owner who might be looking for a description of what each behavior MEANS, which is not what an ethogram is, of course, though this book does sometimes include such commentary.For horse owners who are already well versed in equid behavior, or those casually studying behavior and looking for a more in-depth description to assist them in reading the scientific literature, you need this book.But if you just want to know why horses do what they do, or are interested in better horsekeeping, then read ""Equine Welfare"" by Marthe Kiley-Worthington."
5,Great perfume,I have always loved this perfume and I always use it for any occasion. I am in my mid twenties and consistently get compliments on this perfume. Great purchase!
5,Great book,"Great book! I read first, then the wife. If you are already married the chapters about what to do on your wedding night are a funny read. Nothing goes as planned! Overall, great book that will get you talking about sex."
2,Noble purpose but lacking in depth and sensitivity,"While I appreciate Leman's purpose in writing ""Sheet Music"" was to create better sex and unity in marriage, his execution of that promise fell way short for me. First of all, he seems to share no real sympathy with the female perspective on this issue and comes across more as a sex driven pervert than a mature psychologist interested in nurturing the wounded psyche to consider thoughts of sex and the act of sex as pleasurable and important. He could have saved himself and the many victims unfortunate enough to read his book the time and energy and just printed a bumper sticker, ""If you don't have sex with your husband...and LIKE it; he'll have sex with someone else."""
2,Be cautious about some of his advice...,"This book is well-written, clever and entertaining with some great suggestions. I particularly value his emphasis on communication between a couple regarding sex. I can't ultimately recommend this book to others or give it as a shower gift because I think his advice about ""self stimulation"" is dangerous. Leman advices men to ""self stimulate"" in order to learn ejaculatory control. He advices women to ""self stimulate"" in order to understand her own body and what pleasures her. The danger here, and it's a very real one, is that it can lead to a habit of masturbation, which is destructive and divisive in a marriage and one's own spiritual life. Don't even go there. These things can be learned without ""self stimulation""!"
4,"great book, but...","Ok, so as the other reviews have said this is a great book to read. That is why I gave it 4 stars. However, a few things said in the book upset me. Could just be me, but honestly putting people down for sex before marriage and calling it immoral made my blood boil. Some people are not devout Christians and this can be really insulting. But everyone is entitled to their own opinion...That being the only issue, it was a great read. He really did his homework and hit the nail on the head about all issues. My fiance and I are reading this together. If you cannot talk about sex before marriage, then how do you expect to talk about it after you get married."
2,Sheet Music- Falls flat,"Great book if you are a husband who is having issues with his wife.For myself I kept saying.. humm tried that, and he was too tired, tried that and he picked a fight, tried that and.. you get the point.So this book is Extremely frustrating if you the reader is in a Sex-Starved Marriage--becasue he has issues- which he won't discuss.In a recent article in the WSJ it was stated Women aren't the only ones refusing sex, either. In a study of 75 married people in sexually inactive marriages, Dr. Donnelly found that in 60% of the cases, it was the man who had stopped the sex. This intelligent and personable author needs to do some homework and move his perspective into the 21st century and give us another chapter."
3,Not what I thought.,"I like the book but it isn't what I thought it would be. I am not sure what I expected though, so I can't complain."
5,Awesome book - every couple should read,This book is great. The author does not dodge any bullets and tells it as it is. My prayer is that every married couple out there reads and then gets to experience the level of intimacy this book describes.
5,Very helpful,"I was leery, but this book was recommended to us by our marriage counselor so we went for it. He's very straightforward. Most of the stuff he says has been right on for us and has really changed the way I think about our sex life. I find myself recommending it to all of my friends now."
4,it is nice,"it is a little bit heavy but when you use it you will find it very good ,the quality very good and arrive on time"
4,The tongue is glued to the sneaker. Not sewn. GLUED.,"I've worn these once or twice a week for less than 10 months, and the tongue came off in my hand the other day as I was positioning it after tying the laces. It was immediately apparent that the piece had been glued in place during assembly with what I can only assume is a sub-par hot glue gun. Sketchers clearly doesn't care about quality, or else they might actually sew the parts of the sneaker together, like a real company would do."
5,Easy and convenient,"I was leary about getting this since some reviews here said it was difficult to get the battery in the holder. Not true - it's quite easy, charges quickly and is small enough to fit into my bag. Plus it's cheap!"
1,laughable stinker,"this doesn't even have camp value. I played it once and tried to palm it off on my parents, who were horrified. there are 9 mixes, not the 18 listed, because the track is actually entitled Release Me/Gotta Get Release."
2,Fun for about 5 minutes,"I didnt no it at the time, but this game was supposed to be played with the ROB robot thingy.it was fun crushing the guy with pipes though"
4,Fabulous,This special shows Elvis at his very best - from the great 'jammin' sessions to the on-stage performances featuring all the great sounds he was so noted for. Fun to watch a master in action as well as the styles of the day.
4,Pleasantly suprised,I saw this product at a retail store and wanted it but the cost was too high......looked it up here and now own it for less than a third the cost.Seller disclosed that there was water spots on the paperwork included......I figured so what......result you have to really strain to see anything wrong with it
4,Graceland/BMG...What Happened?,"Every Elvis fan has been waiting for this Deluxe Edition of the 68 Comeback Special.The liner notes say it is the original television special as it was first aired on NBC on December 3, 1968. However, the ""It Hurts Me"" segment is missing. It's listed in the contents of the brochure, it's even on the scene selections on the disc itself, so what happened? Will Graceland recall this incomplete version? I hope so, because this ruins the whole package."
3,Where's the ' surround sound '?,"I originally purchased this item in May 2004.I gave the disc oly 3 stars because of its Monophonic soundtrack!It had been advertised as 5.1, NOT 1.0 !!Video was OK but not spectacular.Caveat Emptor !!!Eddiegolden@shaw.ca"
2,Skip this one...,"This DVD is not worth getting. I'm a huge Elvis fan, but this was not what I was looking for. It's not the full ""68 Comeback special. I watched it with my dad, and he saw the original and this isn't it. It's 3 DVD's total. The first DVD, is pretty good. It shows a lot of the special but not all of it. It also left out a lot of Elvis with his band on the stage with him, in his hot leather outfit. That's the best part of the show and they left most of it out. The second and third DVD in this collection, shows take after take of Elvis doing the same thing over and over. Elvis up close, Elvis from this angle, Elvis's hand up close strumming the guitar. Yeah, that's ok but that's not what I thought I was purchasing. I wanted the actual comeback special and you can totally skip the second and third DVD's because their not that good. Save your money, because this totally misrepresented what it actually is."
2,BUMMER,THE SOUND TRACK IS SIMPLY HORRIBLE. I CAN'T BELIEVE A NEW VHS TAPE WOULD SOUND LIKE THAT. I TRIED IT INTO OTHERS VHS PLAYERS WITH SAME RESULTS.
4,"GREAT SET, BUT STILL IT'S NOT ALL THERE!","I am pleased that this set has been released. Being an Elvis fan since 1977 (I was in kindergarten that year), I have seen this show numerous times on VHS. However, I am somewhat disappointed that a few parts were cut out from disc one.1. He starts to sing ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" for a few seconds then they edit that out and go right to Elvis introducing the Gospel Medley.2. Where's ""That's All Right""?3. During the Guitar Man production number near the end, ""It Hurts Me"" was cut out. Why???????Is there anything that can be done about this. I felt that the original show on disc one was badly edited and this should have never happened. I do like the fact that the entire sit-down and stand-up shows were included as well as the outakes. I would like to say ""this is the most definitive look at the king's comeback"", but I can't, hence the 4 stars only."
1,not worth the price,vendor service was great as always. this album was grossly over-priced and a visual and auditory disappointment.
1,Repeat & Rerun - Boring!,"This was a total waste of money. The ""Aloha"" set was great, but this one was a major disappointment. One entire DVD was nothing but re-takes and out-takes, the same thing over and over. It could have all been scaled down on one DVD and been much more interesting. We are big Elvis fans, just went to Graceland on our anniversary. Elvis was a great entertainer and this is an insult to his fans for paying so much money to be bored! Elvis was never boring!!! This was marketed to get you to buy it, DON'T! Save your money!"
1,this is a joke!!,"This is NOT a video. Just some crapy music with some even crappier pictures. I can't beleive that Amazon even pretends that this is a video. It is obviously just to get your money, because their offerings pitiful. If I could give it NO stars at all I would have. I want my money back!"
5,"I haven't read byock's version, but poul anderson's is good","Poul Anderson's version, long out of print but here at Amazon, is good."
4,"""The Saga of King Hrolf Kraki""","Like a lot of Norse literature it takes half the book to get to the central characters, which is fine if you are expecting it, but can be hard for a reader unfamiler with the genre. The later addition of Christian ideas to ""The Saga of King Hrolf Kraki"" didn't always work with the orginal ideas of the text (Odin is a ""evil spirit"" but they want to go to Valhalla? Not to mention the bashing the reader over the head with Christianity on the last page), making for a kind of muddled work in places. I would have liked the work more without this later addition. What appears to be the older parts are very interesting and reveal ideas of Norse peganism."
4,"holds one's attention, exciting","I am a professional phychic and I enjoy items, books and video's dealing with the paranormal and I like informative products that can enhance the way I deal with this subject and how much I can learn from it. This product is very put together."
5,hospital tape,im an lpn and this is the kind i love to use if i have a choice. when it comes to having to tape something to ones skin this kind is gentle yet stays on. i find a lot of paper tape useless and depend on this. if you need tape for such a reason go with this one.
1,So repetitive.,"Generally I love Eddings but this was not a good read. I feel like every other page was mentioning that bison are harder to kill than deer. It was like a horrible game of telephone where every single character in the book had to say the same exact thing to every other character.Once they finished discussing bison I then had to hear every single character mention that Rabbit makes arrows. Over, and over, and over..."
1,Wont even read it...,"Maybe David Eddings should read his own books, for example ""The Rivan Codex,"" where he blatantly tells people they should not write fantasy adventure books if they are not serious about it. I thoroughly enjoyed all of his books up until ""The Redemption of Athalus,"" I've read and re-read his better books but I am done with this series. I could barely stomache the first two, and now I must give accelades to all of you dear people who had the furtitude to trudge through the 3rd book and then given me the insight to know that I do not want to read it. My only solace is that Eddings may actually read these comments and know that we as fans expect more from him then carbon copied characters, and endless drivel. Read ""The Rivan Codex,"" David Eddings since you wrote it and then re-read this series and honestly ask yourself if you consider this good literature."
2,Disappointed,"These sounded so good, but they're just not very exciting. Bland and kind of doughy in a shortening sort of way, not crispy or flaky like one might expect from the description of ""butter"" and ""puff pastry"". Perhaps refreshed in the oven, as the package suggests, would improve things."
5,Full of ideas I wish I had though of ...,"This book combines the best elements of sci-fi, fantasy, and historical fiction into one. It's set in the far future where most of human civilization wants for nothing, but sent on a distant planet where the local human population lives a hard, feudal, primitive life.The over-arching theme is whether an artificial intelligence can obtain a true identity apart from its creators. A fascinating question that probably doesn't have a ""right"" answer ... and the book leaves room for the reader to reach his or her own conclusions.The beginning can be a little difficult; at first I questioned whether this was the book for me. But I'm very glad I stuck with it!"
3,good for beginners,"A good book for beginners. A word of caution is necessary though, there are many mistakes in the end of the chapter self tests."
2,Not a Good Wood Inlay Technique,"This book has some nice patterns and pictures and for that, I give it 2 stars. But for technique on even the basics of how to inlay, I would have given it a 0."
3,Luther Allison is great,"Dont regret buying, but gave it only 3 stars because I really only like 3 songs. Not the best of the best for slide guitar. But can L. Allison play or what? Am going to check out more of his stuff."
2,Don't buy unless you want an illusion of security,"You may like the look of this mailbox. It is certainly capacious. But don't buy it for security. I was just looking at this product at a store today, and I was easily able to reach through the slot and retrieve the assembly instructions at the bottom of the box. If I can do that, so can a thief who wants my Netflix mail or a bank statement or anything else. To be fair, every ""secure"" mailbox except one that I looked at I could simply reach into and fetch things. This is placebo security."
2,Expensive for the poor quality,"This mailbox will not stop anyone that is wanting to quickly get into it. When the keys to my mailbox were misplaced, I decided to try getting into the mailbox. I was shocked at how easily it could be opened without using any tools. If you give it a good tug, the door will open. Closing it without removing the lock would likely be a challenge though. What I hope is that it will at least cause a drive by snatcher to just move along. In case anyone has lost their keys, you can order a new lock mechanism with keys from the manufacturer via the The Solar Group."
3,Won't Fit Packages,Your mail man probably won't like it because you can't fit very wide packages in it.
4,stop mail theft,"I had a credit card payment stolen from my mailbox which, thank heavens, I noticed in time and cancelled credit card and called bank and the person was arrested-this will ensure future safety! And it looks nice."
1,poor quality,"The sound and picture quality of these films is very poor. The background noise is so loud and distracting, it is sometimes hard to hear the dialogue. Blood on the Sun is particulary bad. I would recommend that you seek out better versions of these films. I would not recommend you buy from this company, you might regret it. This is simply not a good product. Please take my advice, and look elsewhere for purchasing copies of these films."
4,thick,"No frills, but it's thick and spongy with a smooth top like I wanted. It's large enough that I can hang it half an inch over the desk and it works as a wrist pad. (I have an elevated desk.)"
1,What a let-down! I got my money back.,"This is nothing more than soft-core porno-and lousy porno to boot. These people know little about massage, less about soft core porno. A waste of money."
2,"Pretty cheesy for a supposed ""couples massage"" video",I was looking for something to surprize my husband with & this was not it. We both were cracking up laughing through the whole thing!
5,A Delight!,"And here I thought this was going to be just another book about a group of retired folks-wrong! The characters are full bodied and fun, and the plot is a grand one. Terrific new series!"
5,Good Framing Nailer,"I have had no complaints with this nailer. Have used for 2 months now framing in a fixer-uper house. Drives nails well, is a little big and awkward, but it is a framing nailer. No jams."
5,Unparalleled recording,"I've been listening to this CD for about ten years, and it is amazing and inspiring. Abbess Hildegard's music is the definition of ethereal--a pulseless forge of beauty. Kirkby and the Gothic Voices are great interpreters of Hildegard's ""Symphonia."" My favorite track is ""O Ierusalem"" which has almost a 12th century hook (Kirkby sings it at a driving tempo, and her phrasing brings out the rhythmic loops and subtly changing landscape of this awesome piece)."
3,Goody,"This performance is crisp & clean, but lacks the lower registers. For that turn to St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, as I've done."
2,This book slights real human differences.,"I read ""Poisoned Apple"" carefully because education is my full time study. This largely anecdotal book is a description of modern reform ideas in the setting of reform efforts by Betty Wallace in North Carolina. Reformers and reform ideas are overly praised in my judgment while the very real problems of reform are too often blamed on short sighted opponents. True believers in recent versions of education reform will find here confirmation of their views. More dispassionate readers will want to read more widely"
5,Loved it !,"I am an older reader and bought this book, not knowing it was a book for children and young adults. However, I read it with great enjoyment-- easy to read, entertaining, even for someone in my age bracket. I've since bought other books in the ""My Story"" series, and all the ones I've read have been very good. Even older people sometimes can enjoy reading simpler, more straight-forward children's books, and I certainly enjoyed this one."
2,laser broke,"laser broke, got repair kit, did not work. I would not buy another hitachi product. the quality is just not up to standard"
4,Fun video of nude male dancers,"Gotta admit, I really enjoyed this dvd and found it rather fun. OK, so these guys aren't exactly Chippendales...but then again, I don't think Chippendale dancers strip down to nothing (at least they didn't back in the day). These guys are pretty average looking with nice bods, just dancing around in their birthday suits, superimposed over a rather cool ""neon"" background to some nice soothing music. A fun title to put on when friends are over (but don't want anything to get too focused on video-wise), or when you're just hanging out around the house doing household chores. (The dvd is worth purchasing for exceptional hottie Dylan Jordan alone.)"
1,You will get burned two ways!,My husband got burned severely after putting the microwave proof mug in the microwave. Was treated by a doctor several times and missed several days of work. He was scarred and still sensitive. The company made us jump though hoops with documentation of the burns and expenses incurred. In the end they said they would not reimburse us and it was not their responsibility.Burned by the mug and burned by the company.Beware of this company.
1,The reason for one star is that a newer (much faster) version - 8800GT is available for the same price!,"I purchased this card about a month ago. Last week, eVGA announced a newer version, the 8800GT with 512 MB of memory for the same price but the newer version is MUCH FASTER and has more memory. I'm sure the old 320MB GTS version is OK however, if you read the reviews, it is called ""anemic"" by comparison (to the newer GT/512). I've already returned the first one for credit so, I hope this saves some of you some time and frustration with getting an obsolete card...RJ"
3,Why didn't I get the GTX?,This card should perform better at $300. World in Conflict beta only plays well at medium settings with the newest drivers. Any higher settings make the computer crash. Will Crysis even be playable? I have an E6600 with 2 gigs of cas4 RAM running Vista 32bit. Don't even bother with this card if you want the real dx10 gaming experience. Wish someone had told me this.
3,Wobbly but safe,"It seems safe' my hamster enjoys it. Its bigger than i thought it would be... Which isnt really a bad thing, and if it was that'd be my own fault. Whats wrong with it is that its very wobbly and that causes it to make a lot of noise. If i spin it with just my own hand, as opposed to my hammy running in it, it barely makes a sound. I'll try to find a solution to this. By the way i have a 10 gallon tank, it might affect the problem."
2,Noisy Wheel!,"This is described as a ""quiet"" wheel, but it is by far the loudest wheel we've ever had. On the plus side, if you can stand the noise, the size is perfect for a Syrian - most hamster wheels are too small."
4,works fine,the only thing i whish i could do is take off the holder and hook it to the cage. but its good other than that
2,"Terrible, Horrible Product","I bought the large wheel for my hedgehog who won't even touch it. I thought it was because she's lazy, but I ""ran"" my fingers on the wheel to determine the ease in spinning. It was sticking, hard to move and did not spin fluidly at all. I can see why my hedgehog won't go on it. The only plus is that it is solid so her feet would not theoretically get stuck and it fits perfectly in the cage. None of that matters if the wheel doesn't move."
3,Not what inteded for,It would be great if it actually fit for a hedgehog like it said. Definitely not big enough. Other than that it would be okay.
4,Good Product,"This is the 3rd door I've purchased from PetSafe, and I really have no problem with these doors. Sometimes, no matter how well you install these doors, the flap doesn't close all the way and seal properly, which can be a problem in the winter. Here's how to remedy the problem. Go to Harbor Freight and buy a pack of 2 small ceramic block magnets item #97504 for a buck. Glue these magnets with super glue or Gorilla glue, one on each side of the lower outdoor side of the door flap so that when your pet comes back inside, the flap lands against the magnets and seals perfectly. If you play around with this idea you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. Note that you'll have an air gap in the flap the width of the magnets when the dog is outdoors . . but when he comes back in, the flap will land against the magnets and make a perfect seal every time. If your dog spends 90% of his time indoors like mine do, this is a great cheap fix that could save you some bucks on your energy bill."
5,Good cartridge,"Not sure how much I can say about a print cartridge. Either it works, or it doesn't. This works. Installation is fast and easy, so no complaints. Lasts about as long as they claim it should. Obviously it would be a lot nicer if it were half the price, but that's how the manufacturers sell their printers at ridiculously low prices -- they make it up on the cartridges."
2,Naturally Speaking 8,"I have a slight German accent and therefore encountered problems. If you have a foreign accent you might not be happy with this program.I ordered the improved version ""10"" this year. Unfortunately I had to return it as it will not work on a 64 bit PC. The company informed me that this might be fixed in the next version which should be offered in 2009."
3,Drawing book review,This book has tons of tiny figures of everyday items that can be learned how to draw for art journaling.
3,eh... disappointed :(,"I was disappointed that the inside drawings looked just like the cover drawings... duh, I suppose, but I was expecting more. I gave it to the 9-year-old 'patient' anyway, but wasn't excited about doing so."
1,Not at all creative,"Folks, art is supposed to be fun and creative. The drawings in the book are boring and unimaginative. Really just a bunch of mundane 1980's clipart."
5,It made my life better,"All these pictures, I can't decide which ones to do. They are all so easy to draw. And I like it that way. This book made me into a great artist. Keith (age 6 1/2)"
5,An Old Favorite,"I have fond memories of using this book when I was little. You really can create a little world and it's perfect for silly doodles. It is always nice to go back to the basic stick figures. An excellent beginner book - I think every child should have one of ed emberly's books when they're young. You can really learn a lot about shapes like cars and buildings, it's fantastic and really sets up a great foundation. Young children will develop an awareness of the world around them, at least that's what I found when I think back on this book. Simple, easy, and an abundance of room for creativity. The how to's are so short you spend more time using your imagination than trying to copy the pictures. I have little recollection of the coloring books and other things I used when I was little but this book I remember very vividly, it was so helpful and fun that I kept taking it off the shelf long after I needed to."
5,Its' About Time!!!,"Wow! this is the book I've been looking for! I've had Arts & Letters for about a year now and have never been able to find a book on it. This book explains all about the program and about all of the menus and tools too. I like the examples and the files on the cd, and I can tell that Ms. Ballew has been using the program for a long time. Thank You!!!"
5,It had beautiful pictures and was nicely written.,It makes you want to paint even though you could be doing an other hobby.It has wonderful illustrations that were done by kids too.
2,ok,"I really didn't like this movie; I only got it for this personal reason of mine and it's quiet sick and disturbing and personal. Anyway, it's ok, and I'm a computer science major, so I found the plot about computer chips becoming alive interesting, but the story as a whole wasn't well put together. It's cheesy and somewhat laughable. I got it for a used cheap price, so I'm not complaining."
5,"Terribly Sad,,,,","I cried when I read this book, I'm sad for Jeffrey and it would have made WAY MORE sense to have him studied in a hospital to find out if this could be prevented in the future. I did not cry for Jeff, I cried for his Father,,,,,I'm the parent of a son who was troubled in his youth and I could just feel his sadness and grief over his son and I wept for him and his wife and his mother and all of Jeff's victims."
4,"A good book, but it really could have been better","I liked this book; it was pretty good. But I know from reading replica books numbers 1-12, the Marilyn Kaye could have done a better job. The book keeps changing the bad guys, and leaves several questions unanswered. Amy isnt nearly as adventurous as she typically. It's almost all about how much Ms. Heartshorn hates her. This was a good book, but I know it could have been better...."
3,thought provoking,"This was my first ted dekker book, and it was good.It had a lot of suspense, but it was a little predictable.The ending could have been a little more descriptive, but a great book. I plan to read the circle trilogy and th e HOUSE next"
5,BEST DEKKER BOOK BY FAR!,"Not only did I read this book I also purchased the audio book. This is--in my opinion--the single greatest Christian Fiction novel I have ever read! Dekker takes a sensitive subject--such as WWII--and not only humanizes the villain but he also carries the pain that was suffered by the captives of the camps and their families. Offhand I do not recall who read the book on the audio cd but there could not be a better voice to portray the voices of Dekker's characters. I read through some of the ""1 star"" reviews and I could not disagree more! Although spiritual warfare is a theme in this book I do not find it to be exclusively about spiritual warfare. There are a few scenes in the book that are a little graphic but most defiantly not over the top! The subject matter in this book is not only realistic it is captivating! DEKKER'S BEST BY FAR!"
3,entertaining,"i have to agree, while an entertaining read, not up there as one of dekkers best books. i was never quite able to get inside the head of the main character and his reasons why he was behaving in his obsessive manner and to be honest with you, i didn't find this story as captivating as it could have been. perhaps because the reader is held at arms length somehow as the story jumps from past to present day and back againit begins well, the suspense is very subtle and sinister but i think too much of the story ends up being focused on trying to break into a basement and perhaps thats what made me lose interest, it was not a believable obsession. you never quite know what is going to happen next"
4,Obsessed,"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down, so I read it from 6:00 pm to 1:00 am, until I was finished. I was obsessed with Obsessed. It wasn't my favorite book though because, compared to Dekker's other books, it seemed too weird that a regular guy would obsess over something he doesn't understand. But I guess this is a metaphor to our obsession of God even while we don't understand."
3,It was okay...,"Obsessed left me feeling flat.Dekker's normally taut storytelling somehow got lost in this story with unremarkable characters and unremarkable plot. Normally, when I finish a Dekker book, I love to talk about the book, about the characters and the plot. With Obsessed, I couldn't think of anything to say. When I went to my favorite online book discussion and tried to start a thread about the book, no one else could think of anything to say, either and the thread died after three posts.Normally, I enjoy Dekker's books very much. The Circle triology is one of the better fantasy series of this century. I enjoyed the twists of Three, the suspense of Blink, and even the starkness of Saint. But Obsessed seemed to lack what these other books possess, a plot. At the end, I didn't care about any of the characters or their situations.Don't worry, though, there are plenty of great Dekker books to make up for this one flat one."
4,My first experience with a Ted Dekker book was positive.,"Obsessed is a spiritual thriller about stolen treasures, stolen lives, and personal obsessions. Among its characters are Holocaust survivors and unrepentant Nazi war criminals. Set alternately in a Nazi concentration camp (Turon, Poland during 1944-45) and 1973 Los Angeles, this is the story of a man seeking answers to the mystery of a Jewish mother that he never knew and of two mothers who made supreme sacrifices.I enjoyed every minute of it, although some of the main character's decisions and plans seemed too distorted by his obsessions. Overall, Obsessed is a very good read!"
1,Not that great,"At 32 minutes long and too much introduction, I found this DVD overpriced. Though the underwater photography is fine, it's also short on the good footage and there is way too much chatter. I was looking for a high-quality production that would engage my three-year old who is fascinated by the ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" BBC production. He liked the jumping dolphins but otherwise this DVD is WAY THIN. I don't recommend it."
5,Nice special features,"I'd recommended this DVD for children ages 7 and up. It's packed with special features and a respectful message. My child's favorite was ""Relax with Fish and other Animals"" -- a 10 minute music video."
5,Excellent pictures and details,Ad Konnings is an expert in African cichlids and this book shows it lucidly. His detailed explanation and pictures make this book a must have for any old world cichlid keeper.
4,"Close to Nerf Turbo, but not quite.","I bought this item in place of the classic Nerf Turbo (which does not exist anymore apparently). It is a close reproduction but not exactly the same. The colors are totally different than the Nerf and what is shown on the site also. The one I received was green, not red and black. Good item though, and should be a lot of fun."
4,very nice,"I've had it for two months now and already cooked in it a few times and it cooks wonderfully, not any worse than my old Romertopf clay cooker, which finally cracked after 15 years of faithful service. The reason I am rating it at 4 stars instead of 5 is that it has a slightly looser fit between the top and bottom. Also it has the shorter ""lip"" on the bottom half which is important when you take it in and out of the oven. I am a bit nervous about losing hold on it every time I am taking it out."
1,"Cooker cracked in two in the oven, halfway through cooking!","Was horrified to discover the pot split in half 2 hours into the 3.5 hours needed for cooking my New Year's eve cassoulet. This was a total disaster, dumping liquid into the bottom of the stove (where the gas burners are), which dripped through into holes in the back of the kitchen island. It took me hours to clean this up.....not to mention the ruining of a New Year's eve feast. Don't risk cooking in one of these if you value your oven! I have a photo of it broken in half in the oven, but am unable to attach a photo to this review."
5,"Lovely to look at, great to use....","This decanter is not only lovely to look at with its classic lines, it's great to use."
3,"looks nice, but hard to use","This certainly looks nice, and it's fun, but pouring the last glass or two is difficult. The decanter has to be almost completely inverted to empty it. This is not too difficult, but because of the angle, the wine comes out very quickly and can easily spill."
2,Was not compatible with my wireless plan.,"This is a very interesting phone, very usefull tools, etc... However, my wireless plan (T-mobile) has features that were not compatible with this phone."
3,Lots to consider...,"Lotsa things to think about...Buy it from Ace Photo Digital, there's no battery. In fairness, while the ad doesn't promise a battery, the fact that it is a specialty battery, it seems annoying that a battery is not included. So be warned; order a battery with this item.It appears not to turn off, but it actually does. A residual charge on the light-amplifier seems to keep it operating even when turned off. Eventually, the charge will bleed off, the unit will shut off. I discovered this when it continued to 'operate' with the battery removed. No drain on the battery... I think.Focus is hard to do... as described by other reviewers, but with effort and patience, you can do a resonable job. It seems to work better for me if I take my glasses off.So much for the cons...The light enhancement is impressive and works great considering the price. The IR improves performance significantly. Overall, it was more than I expected. I'd recommend it to others."
4,A welcome return to greatness,"A great album to rock out to, this is their best work since Earth Vs. If you like The Darkness and their balls to the wall brand of rock 'n' roll, you'll love this (and Justin Hawkins makes a brief guest appearance...see if you can spot it). Trust me, you won't regret buying this album."
5,BUY THIS CD,"Kenny Roby's new CD is darn near perfect. It doesn't sound like anything he ever done before, yet it sounds like a Kenny Roby record. That is a good thing.You can hear the hope in ""New Day"". My favorite tune on the CD is ""Evidently You""."
4,A really good read.,"Ms. Grabien has a wonderful way of mixing history and music into a tense ghost story. I do wonder a bit, how many times she can make this formula work. But, there's a interesting cast of characters and well-done descriptions that add to the suspense. My only small complaint was the use of French without translation. But, for paranormal fans, it's a good read."
2,Ugly,"This was infact the worse comic drowing I ever seen , I'll remember the name Cristopher Moeller for never to buy a comic by his name again, though I did give the comic 2 stars its only as response for the plot, which would've become 4 stars if not for him . which is all about how WONDER WOMAN get a prophecy that the JLA will be massacred if they went to face a dragon , and for that she betrayed the JLA got them out of earth for her to face the Dragon as a the ""league in one"" knowing that death a wait her."
3,good not great,"i was hoping for a nerf equivalent from my youth that Nerf doesn't seem to sell anymore. I loved the bright color (mine came bright orange) and the fact that it is a sponger football perfect for my son. What I think it lacks is the perfect ""weightiness"" that always seemed to let me throw perfect spirals as a kid. This feels like a big piece of foam and nearly all throws end up as end of end woblers without the distance and beauty that were possible with a more solid feeling nerf ball.Hope that helps."
3,Useful Reference,"I like this book because, frankly, I can't remember all the nutritional and storage information on all fruits and vegetables. Which are the highest in fiber? Which are the highest in folate? This full-color, spiral-bound book answers those questions. It lists fruits and vegetables alphabetically, giving nutritional information for each. There are also small sections on ""best"" vegetables for various needs, and on ethnic vegetables. This is a good book for learning about the various fruits and vegetables. You will have to go to a cookbook to get recipes for these foods."
4,Brit boys rock,These Brit boys blew me away. The sexual undertones were just enough to keep you on edge and wanting more. The plot itself challenges anyone stuck in their way of doing things to see EVERYTHING from a different perspective.
4,A very nice story indeed,"Well I liked it very much,it is witty and of course there are all the tricks in the book;but the acting is ok.I can recommend it!"
5,Noddy Goes To Toyland,Enid Blyton captures a child's heart and starts them on the wonderful adventure of reading with her Noddy Series. These were some of the first books I learned to read when I lived in Scotland and have treasured them since. I have read them to my children and grandchildren and still get delight from reading them again to myself! Everyone should experience Noddy!
2,good product,"when u print the paper u found ink dots on paper, those dots are too large and wet if u touch that, ink comes to your hand. After the use for few days it print the paper very fine. Good product with less price and it is compatible."
1,Don't waste your $,"I had a coleman tablecloth for several years. So when it was time to replace it, I didn't think twice. This new tablecloth is horrible. It's very thin and not durable. I am quite disappointed."
4,High Quality Release for a Deserving Film,"The first time I saw the infamous Cannibal Holocaust I was under-impressed. After all, I had heard so much about it and it didn't quite live up to everything that had been said about it. Then again, I had seen the Substance dvd version, which left much to be desired as far as visual quality.Upon reading about the film again in Jay Slater's ""Eaten Alive"" book, I decided to give the film another shot. I watched the Substance dvd again and realized that this truly was an impressive film. It really is hard to watch, it really is brutal, it really is unflinching and disturbing. I almost felt bad for sitting through it.I was thrilled to receive the Grindhouse 2-disc edition in the mail. The packaging is unbelievable, although the first disc was loose in my package also (although it plays fine). The film itself looks amazing and the entire second disc of extras is worth the price alone.Buy this now before you're paying $75 on ebay for it."
1,"Weak, boring and pathetic","If you want ot be disgusted, shocked and offended then watch this film. Ifyour a hardcore horror fan, skip it. Animal cruelty and sexual violence isnt scary its a weak attempt at shock value. The very end of this movie was cool because the antagonistic film crew making the so-called ""documentary"" get theirs. The FX are suspect althought the end did get a bit intesne. The music was wierd and unimpressive. The scariest part of this movie was the ""70s Bush"" *GAG* Dont waste your money, its over hyped. If you must see it try to spend the least amount of money possible. Its laughable that this film was banned in several countries."
2,Pseudo Documentary,"and boring as H311!For the most part, its just a boring flick about guys doing a documentary. With like 2 scenes of cannibalism and 3 scenes of rape.Its as boring as a documentary would be without being educational.It isnt gory, it isnt educational..it's just flat out boring!If you watch this flick, you will wish you could get back the time that you wasted watching thisDid I mention it was boring?I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the lovely scenery."
2,"too much hype, not enough action","lets start off by saying this, I am a huge horror fan, this movie was dissapointing. I mean are you kidding me this film doesnt go that far. its so fake I cant belive people back in the day watched this and thought it was real. way too much hype for this movie. Maybe I had too high of expectations but seriously this movie isnt that good long and boring. Dont get me wrong there are a few scenes that are crazy but nothing too drastic."
1,Snuff Film,"If you want to throw up, why don't you just stick your fingers down your throat? It's a lot cheaper than shelling out good money for this insipid movie that mimicks an arty film what with its movie-within-a-movie structure and its exploitative premise, quod erat demonstradum, that civilized man is more barbaric than the cannibals.""Cannibal Holocaust"" is little more than a snuff film with animals, in lieu of humans, as the actors and murder victims. The stomach-turning filming of the actual killing and mutilating of animals is not art.The killings aren't even artfully photographed or edited. As one of the characters at the end of this movie says in disgust after viewing the film of animal and human slaughters, ""Burn it."" Good advice.--Bryan Cassiday, author of ""Fete of Death"""
1,I wish I could give it less than one,"This move is pathetic. It's dull, boring, and poorly shot. The director's attempt to cover up the lack of plot and the terrible story-telling, with extreme gore and violence, fails horribly. It's not scary, and It's not entertaining. The animal killings are horrific, unnecessary, and are supposedly true (I don't see how they could be fake). They serve no purpose to the story. I SERIOUSLY regret paying money for this. There is absolutely nothing of value in this film."
4,Babes in the Woods,"This was the original inspiration for the cult favorite The Blair Witch Project. It's far better. It deals with a theme that comes up in other movies, such as Southern Comfort. A student film crew ventures deep into the upper Amazon rain forest in search of a mysterious tribe of alleged cannibals. They're never heard from again. A professor goes in search of them, and discovers the tribe. The natives still have all the film that the students had shot, right up until their deaths. He brings it back to New York.It tells their story, and it's not a pretty one. As it goes on, one can see the chain of events that led to their unpleasant fate. This movie is not just another gorefest. Its lessons are timeless."
1,Bamboozled by hype,"I was very disappointed in this film: the acting is distractingly amateurish, and there is no plausibility to the behaviors of the characters (viz., film crew). I did not feel invested in the characters or story. The musical score is a higgledy-piggledy mess and does not make the contribution that a well-fitting score should. I am also sorely disappointed in myself for succumbing to the marketing hype for this film. Never again."
1,"Actually a ""0"" Rating","The film is lifeless (the first hour crawls) and not very scary. You want the main characters to die because they are one-dimensional, cruel and downright annoying. The natives had every right to be restless - and bloodthirsty. The Special Features are at least, more entertaining & historically insightful.Yes, I was curious after reading some estatic reviews. Watch at your risk and don't blame me if you feel you wasted your money: I put my DVD copy up for sale on Amazon.Happy viewing! ;)"
1,Cannibal Holocaust,Worst online buying experience of my LIFE. It arrived extremely late and would not play. Whe I asked for another copy or what the return policy is I received no responce. Buyer BEWARE
1,worthless,"Somehow a lot of people find this movie worthwhile, and even consider it a ""classic"". Trust me, it is not. The basic plot of the movie isn't terrible, but the execution is. The acting is awful and the movie relies on extreme gratuitous violence that exists solely for the shock value. It is not scary, and it does not have any redeeming qualities. It is not a condemnation of modern society, in fact the actors and director commit the same atrocities that they are supposedly ""condemning"". The animal killing scenes are real and disgusting(couldn't even watch), and it is truly horrible that those creatures lost their life for this movie. Deodato is obviously a disturbed egomaniac, and I honestly wouldn't mind if he gets violently murdered. I know people will keep watching this out of morbid curiousity like I did, but download it and don't waste your money, especially by giving it to truly sick people."
1,short changed,I just received my magnets. There are not 20 magnets but 10. The box says 20 but there are 10. I feel that i have been cheated by this company.
3,number 14-- ugh!,I loooooove replica books and I can't put them down! but this one-- this one put me to sleep! this is my least favorite of the replica books but if you want to read the whole series (which i suggest) you have to read this book and get it over with. You will love number 15 though.
5,Excellent Value for Money,"This book covers everything from the history of the flute/whistle, the tonal scales, basic ornamentation for irish music thru' to pieces to play, not to mention CDs. An excellent text book at a great price."
4,It's one of the best,"I would venture to say that this CD is one of Dr. Frank and Company's better recordings. It's clear that he continues in his ""This is a song about a girl"" genre and comes up with some very good tracks. And if you think that punk rock is too hard, Dr. Frank comes through with two acoustic tracks that are definately more than exceptional. I would recommend this CD to anyone, especially good, honest, MTX fans out there."
3,Good Enough,I bought this so that I could complete my collection of owning all of The Acacia Strain albums. I'm not much of a fan this album as I am the rest but I just wanted to have it. The overall condition was alright however the case has a fairly large crack across the top. Other than that it works and looks great with the rest of the discography.
2,Too expensive,They sell this rice too expensive on Amazon!! You can get it for a lot of cheaper from Chinese Supermarket.
5,RICHARD BURTON: A LIFE,"This book is well written, informative and thoroughly enjoyable. Not surprising as I have never been disappointed by anything I've purchased from Amazon.com. Pricing is reasonable and delivery is always fast."
3,30 + years later,I read this book while taking a business management class over 30 years ago. We all had to do a book report. I had a couple of beers before class and told the managers to be that I would give them a quick synopsis of the book and then answer questions as I belived Schrank would. Boy did I get them PO'd. I don't think many of them had ever looked at work from the workers point of view. They really didn't like the anodote about the first management decision being made by the guy who couldn't make clay pots. You'll have to read the book. Anyway I got an A+. I have been a worker's manager ever since and have always had motivated people who kept me out of trouble. One of the top 10 books in impact on my life for sure.
5,Very nice,"I bought these in the refurb isle and they look just as good as the new (i would think). Very modern design, light but yet heavy enough for everyday use. The spoons are a little odd shaped, but i like 'em."
1,knockoff?,"I had ordered the WMF flatware set,because the brand is usually top of the line.Well tough luck.Flatware was very light,no markings exceptMade in Korea.Only the box was marked WMF.To us,this appeared to be a cheap knockoff.We did not like the set whatsoever,and it was returnedto Amazon.FG"
4,A Very Likeable Book********,"Much better than her Vinegar Hill, Ansay shimmers in this. The characters are silly, flawed, and plain real. Having not read many stories about weddings, I have little to compare it to. It was a nice escape, pleasant to follow, & overall a delightful change from some dramas I've been delving into.I definitely will read more of her."
3,Hard to get past the awful title...,"The weakest of Ansay's novels, Midnight Champagne seems to be a jumble of loosely tied vignettes that never becomes more than the sum of its helter-skelter parts. Ansay's descriptions and acute knack for summing up a character with a telling detail are here, but there's no plot, and nothing that sticks with the reader when the book's closed."
5,This is what a book should be!,"Midnight Champagne is my favorite of all of Ansay's published work. The structure of the book is ingenius; the various pathos, observations, grudges and relationships between guests at a wedding involve the reader in each and every character. At least this reader cared about each and every character, and I appreciated the neat resolution of each character's particular conflict/story arc. Many of the observations in this book are laugh-out-loud hilarious (echos of Anne Tyler), and others are bittersweet (also echos of Anne Tyler). This book makes me hope that Ansay is enjoying a respite from her illness and that she will release another book soon. There is also the element of the mystical (echos of Alice Hoffman) which serves to pull the separate arcs of this novel into one fnal bittersweet family view."
2,Misleading advertising-Not as described,"This is supposed to be a Craftsman 3/8"" & 1/4"" drive 6 point socket set-this is the description copied & pasted------- Includes: 1/4"" Inch Drive Sockets (8) Six-point standard sockets: 7/32"", 1/4"", 9/32"", 5/16"", 11/32"", 3/8"", 7/16"", 1/2"" (7) Six-point metric sockets: 4mm, 5mm, 6mm, 7mm, 8mm, 9mm, 10mm 3/8"" Drive Sockets (7) Six-point standard sockets: 3/8"", 7/16"", 1/2"", 5/8"", 11/16"", 3/4"", 9/16"" (6) Six-point metric sockets: 10mm, 11mm, 12mm, 13mm, 14mm, 15mm (1) Spark plug socket: 5/8"" 3/8"" Drive Tools (1) QR teardrop ratchet.

These will be returned for a refund.The description is misleading and false."
3,Disappointed,"The product came with individual sockets, etc dumped in loose plastic bags. I was disappointed to find there was no container for the individual sockets. This makes it very inconvenient to use. It needs a tool box sized for the individual pieces!"
4,Wonderful,"My friend suggested this devotional. My husband was hesitate at first, but after a couple of nights he told me he really enjoyed reading it each night together. It is such a great way to reconnect with your spouse and Christ."
3,A devotional for couples with children,"My husband and I were given several copies of this book for wedding gifts. While I am sure those who chose to give it to us had the best of intentions, this book is mainly aimed at couples who already have children, not newly married couples.We have faithfullly read it each night together and, although some of the weekly topics and questions don't apply to us at this time in our lives, we have found it to be a fairly good book. Some of the questions have led to further discussion, which is always good.I would say this is a good devotional, but not a great one, it is fairly standard in the way of devotionals. It may be great for older couples with children, but I would not reccommend it for newly married couples."
2,Stereotypical,"I was disappointed by the book's traditional gender roles and stereotypical depictions of marriage. I was hoping for a more modern perspective that would more deeply challenge my relationship, but found the book bland and frustrating."
4,Great book until Lenny.....,"I really enjoyed reading the Long Firm..the characters of Harry and the others are brilliantly written. My only two complaints are the preachy criminal-sociology analysis that takes up a good bit of the Lenny segment and Harry the Hat's demise is a little close to the events of the Goodfellas. When Arnott gets back to the story line, the book takes off again. A good read."
5,"Fairly easy to fit, looks huge on my 2yo!","This was the second helmet we tried after we discovered that theGiro Me2 Infant Bike Helmetwas too small (according to the Giro specs, it should have fit, but the shape of the helmet did not match the shape of my son's head so it just didn't work). But this one fit my 2yo (in the 99th percentile so he's BIG!) perfectly. And it was fairly easy to adjust--the worst part being the sections around the ears (which as another reviewer stated, you just can't seem to get them to lay perfectly flat). But it didn't seem to bother my son at all, so YMMV on that one. We haven't actually gotten to officially try it out yet since my son isn't taking to his bike as quickly as we hoped...but hopefully I'll never have to write an update on how great the helmet was after a crash!"
3,"Bad Title, OK book","This book DOES NOT teach you how to solve IQ puzzles. In the beginning, it simply gives you a general overview of the types of questions found on common IQ tests. The rest of the book, the vast amjority of it, is simply IQ exercises with answers, again not answers that show you how to solve anything."
4,This Book Has Helped Me,"I'm only about halfway through this book, but even the title alone has given me a lot of help and inspiration to change my ways. I mean, that's exactly what I've been doing...digging my grave with my knife and fork.There are some great tips and reading this book just makes one realize how much one has to change and eat right to live right. I would recommend this book."
5,Satisfying,"Tepper succeeds again with this outstanding novel. The two storylines initially seem disconnected, but they merge in an ingenious way due to Tepper's sometimes deceptive descriptions.Dora the detective is a sympathetic character. Her easy acceptance of all the weirdness going around her is refreshing, and we feel we can trust her to pull all the puzzling threads together."
5,amazing,Such a great moisturizer..i have a dry skin and nothing was working for me in winter until i found this lotion in my make i bought it long time ago from store but didnt use it... ...it did magic.my skin looks younger and soft all dry spots were gone....must have for me and prize is reasonale ..
4,Hogue quality,"This is your standard quality Hogue grip that they've been making forever. It fits your hand perfectly and is easy to install. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would like to see some stipling on the rear of this grip like the stock grip has. It would assist in the grip not twisting in your hand during magazine changes and manipulating the safety. Overall, it is great quality and a must-have."
5,Love this grip still after 5 years!!,"Well I have had this grip on my AR for the past 5 years now and it is still holding strong. With all the options out there these days for grips, I still haven't strayed from this Rubber grip. 5 years is a long time for almost anything and it still feels and seriously looks almost like it did out of the package! Its crazy! BUT im a firm believer in it and it has never failed yet! Great job Hogue!"
5,AR15 rubber grip,Everyone should know about HOGUE'S products and this grip is no exception.It feels like the grip is griping you not you griping it.FEELS PERFECT
5,jcom,Hogue makes a good product. Everythig fit right up and very easy to change. Recommended to anyone needing a replacement grip or just wants a better grip on their Ar.
5,Buy This Grip,"This grip is the best accessory I have purchased. The size of the grip is spot on. I have fairly large hands and it fits perfectly. The finger grooves provide additional grip to the textured exterior. I didn't realize how poorly the stock grip fit until I installed the Hogue. The install is easy, one allen screw, just be sure not to lose the selector spring. The Hogue has a selector spring hole, same as the stock grip. I'm not much on gadgets but for a pure improvement in the handling of your rifle, this grip fits the bill and it's inexpensive."
2,"If you follow the instructions correctly, you miss!","The packet says ""Contains Two Servings"". The instructions call for 6 oz hot water to 3 ""heaping"" tablespoons of the cocoa powder. Both packets I opened contained less than 5 rounded tablespoons, which definitely doesn't equal ""Two Servings"". 3 heaping teaspoons makes an adequate cuppa, but only adequate. Add 1 tsp to get a good flavor. And by the way, the instructions say ""Watch it magically trun purple"" It turns an unhealthy shade of pale blue grey. Really pretty lame stuff, & the seller hasn't bothered to respond, which makes them lamer than this crap. BTW, I just hoticed that my review of this seller has ""been removed"". I didn't remove it. They are truly lame."
4,"A ""must-read"" for anybody who thinks they like Tom Clancy","Two of Clancy's forgotten books, they also aren't the best or the worst of his lot. Red Storm Rising is an earlier novel of Clancy's that attempts to take on just a little too much in not enough pages, but is an entertaining and somewhat believable read anyway. The Cardinal of the Kremlin is also highly recommended to help fill out the Jack Ryan character that so many of us love... the story is well-crafted and does not read as techinically as some of his other work, making it an excellent choice for people just starting to read Clancy."
2,I can barely stand it!,"In general, I find the book mostly readable. The topic is interesting and the presentation is enjoyable - when the author sticks to the facts. But having read roughly 3/4 of it so far, I find myself contantly fighting the urge to just dump it in the trash in response to the sniveling diatribes that crop up every other page. According to the author, we humans should spend our lives feeling totally guilty simply because we exist and have spent that existence screwing up the planet in political power struggles, profit mongering, and general poor behavior. It's a wonder we even bother to take time out from our well-deserved self-flagellations to attempt to educate ourselves with a book about the world around us. Even when expounding on world efforts to bring CFC emmisions under control, the author whines, ""We are just left to wonder if it is too little, too late"".I cringe at what might await in his book about the Bible! I think I'll pass."
2,Interesting but too many errors,At least one of his dates are off by 401 years. The suicide at Masada took place in 70 A.D. not 471. Clearly this is one thing that you don't need to know because it didn't happen 30 years short of a time period we call medieval Europe. Does this guy even know what was really happening in Jerusalem in 471?
5,Great Resource,A wonderful DVD. The segments are very thoughful. It helped open up discussions in my Sunday school class about important issues so many people face. I highly recommend it.
5,Great product!,This item seems to be the most beneficial muscle pain reliever we have found.Would certainly recommend it for anyone suffering muscle pain.
3,Helpful as an introducion to Swedish emigration.,The chapters of this book set out the points of major importance about Swedish emigration to America. This is good as a place to start reading about Scandinavian emigration studies and its solid selected bibliography is helpful for guidance to more academic works.
2,The layout of this book is horrible.,"I own all of Lou Reed's CD's and was thrilled to receive this book as a gift because I was genuinely looking forward to reading the lyrics in book form of my favorite song. The conceit that the designers of this book took is unforgiveable, however. Pages printed upsidedown or backwards aren't clever. They just show a lack of caring towards the reader. I got frustrated with this book and probably will put it on the shelf where it will collect dust."
4,Enjoying.,Choral group I sing with will be performing one of the numbers. Bought album to assist with learning the music.
5,Superb & intriguing in every way,"This has become one of my favorite CDs of any style.The subtle, carefully recorded pieces by Britten on this recording are all first rate and are also fascinating. For example, one piece uses poems about simple everyday animals like cats & mice to open up ones mind about the nature of God's character & creation. Very contemporary in arrangement, with a great deal of drama, but at other times with sincere, deeply felt worship. I would recommend this to anyone- listen with open ears to these 20th century gems, and absolutely perfect voices."
5,The Funniest Human on the planet,"If you are not laughing at this man, you are seriously disturbed or...you are conservative and/or hardcore Christian. He is vulgar, crass and still, a charming, hilarious man. Caught his first special on Showtime one night, nearly p**d my pants laughing...and I DO NOT laugh out loud. Next to Katt Williams, he is the funniest. Though they do tend to run a bit long, his stories are funny as all get out. His comedic timing is flawless. If you have a no holds barred attitude, u will not regret this purchase."
5,Eye watering fun,"Fantastic. Raw, rude, and right on the money. Purchased never having heard of him, just on the recommendation of a friend of mine, and didn't regret it. Sharply intelligent and scathingly sarcastic. Rates up there for me with early Gallagher."
1,Don't waste your time,Don't waste your time. He's not clever or funny. I'm shocked that so many people gave him a good review.
5,Great job Kellie!,"Kellie did a wonderful job on this CD.Each song on it, is wonderful! I can't say enough good things about it.Awesome job on the songs!I'd recommend it to any person who loves Country music. It's great country music, done by a wonderfully talented person who's been through alot in her life."
2,Not worth it,"Now I know why Kellie did not win American Idol. She is a clone of Carrie Underwood, but without the vocal chops and personality. Watching the show, she had a good voice, but not great. On this album, her weaknesses are displayed for all to see. The lyrics are pretty bad throughout the record. Some try to make fun of her act (you know, the dumb country girl. I mean come on, you did not buy that act did you?). Some are so cliche that you shake your head.The production value is high as expected. They clean up her voice well. But she just is not that great of a singer. And this is just an average record. I would expect to see one more album maybe from her, then it is off to the ""what ever happend to"" file."
