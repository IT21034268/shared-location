4,"good read, practical tips","This book was used by our small group for a group study. The book has some good, thought provoking items. In addition, it has some useful tools to work on jealousy, forgiveness, guilt, and anger. This is not a deep theological read, but I found this useful. The book makes some good, biblically based points on HOW to change our views and fix some of the ""stuff"" that corrupts our Christian life. I found the points that Andy Stanley makes about jealously quite hard and challenging but true. It adds some tools to your faith to help you be more Christ like. You will find the DVD is a good resource. Thumbs up."
2,There are better books out there,"For some reason, I can't seem to enjoy reading this as I have with other books of the time. I'm reading this with Eusebius and they pair well to get a better feeling of the time. This seems like history on the light side. However, the price isn't bad, the font is a good size, the page color is nice and readable. The page thickness allows for re-reading without concern for the pages tearing."
4,Como subir en un tren,"Esta buena banda alemana ha sabido sacar jugo del exotismo de sus instrumentos, pues no sólo el sonido de vibráfonos, bajo y percusión manda, sino las extrañas melodías del violín que parecieran sacadas de un espacio y tiempo de lo más ignoto. A veces parece que Embryo busca rememorar el ambiente del Medio Oriente, visto desde una ventana de tren a alta velocidad, lo cual no quiere decir que sus impresiones sean superficiales (como por ejemplo en el caso de Dreaming Girls). Un tema para atraparnos a todos, por su concepción, espíritu nocturno, fresco y veloz: Radio Marrakesh, que comienza de día y con una alta torre donde se recitan oraciones al desierto y luego la modernidad que llega en vagones a alta velocidad: teclados, bajo, percusión de gran precisión. Un punto a favor para tu colección."
2,Vanessa's only entry to her Hall of Shame,"Listening to this song and comparing to Vanessa's more superb songs, this one gets lost in the glow of the others.The lyrics are somehow dorky and the arrangement of the Single Version is too formulaic that one would suspect that this song was only concocted to add a more pop-oriented song to her debut.The original album version is more listenable though, with its more stripped-down, almost acoustic arrangement."
2,Meh,"JMajik deserves respect as a producer, and his mixing skills on this album are passable. However what really struck me as a negative on this album is the ""randomness"" of the track selection, none of the mixes are very interesting, and it is clear not much consideration was given to the tunes flowing well into one another. Things are beat matched for a thirty seconds or so, then the next track is dropped in. The mixes are boring. And beside the standout hits like Kerbkrawler, The Nine, and Solarize most of the tunes are bland. Skip this one."
3,Comfortable but large,Comfortable shoes but they felt a size larger. The color was black yet the strap lining was a light tan color -- I had to take extra time when closing the velcro (folding over the strap) to cover the lighter color.
5,"So useful, I wish I had another","I don't use this for butter - I use it for other things I want to warm up like water, pasta sauces, garlic, broth, anything. For making small meals - for my husband and I - it is just perfect, I don't have to use big pots for small jobs.The quality of the pot is unbeatable - it is very thick metal, especially in the handle, but it is small and surprisingly light in weight, easy to carry around the kitchen.It will tend to tip backward if you have nothing in it or if you have just garlic or something tiny in it, but with at least some liquid in it, it does just fine.One bonus, the inside is very slippery, which makes for easy and quick heating of liquids - nothing really sticks to the inside, which is great.No shipping problems, comes in a nice box.Very impressed, considering buying another."
4,I spell fun H-A-R-D-Y B-O-Y-S,"I am giving this review four stars because my only caveat is that you never get to hear a full Shaun Cassidy song. You hear enough to tease you into buying whatever album of his was hot in the seventies, but not the whole thing. This show is as much fun as Scooby Doo (and that's a compliment). Both Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy displayed a laid back, easy pairing that transcended the not-so-challenging scripts. They are just fun to watch, and when you get to hear some of that great bubble gum pop Shaun sang so well, you have a show that shines as bright as that lava lamp collecting dust in your attic. Do I like this show? I da doo run run."
1,All this sucked up & zapped was my money.,"I bought this to replace one I had bought years ago. The first one worked great, but after 4 years lost its suction. This new one worked great.... for a month. Then it lost its suction. I can't believe the difference in the two. I will not buy another one. But what I have found that works quite well is a swiffer mop without the swiffer cloth. It's hard enough to squash those nasty spiders, but soft enough not to damage the paint. It's long enough so I don't have to get close and risk a spider falling on me and the head can be angled any way I want. So if you need to kill spiders at a distance, save yourself some aggravation and a lot of cash and go for a swiffer."
4,Stink Bugs watch out !,"I bought this sort of as a joke for my hubby and daughter for Christmas. Turns out it is an excellent product for sucking up those notorious Stink Bugs. No stretching or straining to get them off of the ceiling, the door screen or lamp shades. We have recommended this to all of our friends!"
1,Disapointment,This vacuum only works on stink bugs or for that matter any bugs that are already dead. It has no suction. Do not waste your money on this one.
1,Do Not Buy This Device -- It Does Not Work,The suction in this device does not work. Too weak. Find another product.
2,I'm just disappointed,"I bought this Bug Vac because my friend told me she uses one. What a bust. I was a little skeptical because of some of the more negative reviews, but I figured it might be worth it to have something help me catch the roaches (I live in Texas). The vac works but ONLY on hard, flat, smooth surfaces and ONLY with smaller bugs. It will not suck up the giant tree roaches we sometimes get. So, mine sits in its charger most of the time."
4,"Not perfect, but it does work","My only criticism of this product is that it could use a bit more suction power. There are times when it just won't suck up an active bug. But overall, I am very pleased. We live in a horse area, and there are LOTS of flies, sometimes dozens that get inside the house. Swatting them was a major chore. Using the Bug Vacuum, I can pretty much suck up the flies in a few minutes. It worked on spiders as well. Then, it sucks them to the bottom and electrocutes them. Cleaning isn't bad..just pull off the tube and use a little brush to sweep the remnants into the trash. The recharging holder enables me to keep the ""weapon"" handy and charged for immediate use. I would recommend this product."
2,Underpowered,"The product seemed to be well made, but it was not powerful enought to pick up a stink bug. When one bug was placed inside the intake, the bug was not drawn down to the electric grid. I returned the product since the whole reason for the purchase was to collect these unpleasant pests inside my house."
1,Useless,"I hate stink bugs. So I bought this vacuum. I had been charging it for a week and was so excited to use it, as the first stink bug victim appeared in my kitchen. I put the vacuum DIRECTLY over the bug. Nothing. The bug just sat there. I think I heard it laughing.Don't waste your money."
4,Great Bug Killer,"I always had to drag out the vacuum to get spiders off the ceiling. Now I just grab this bug sucker - it is quicker and quieter.The only problems are the vacuum isn't as hi-powered as a real vacuum and the end doesn't mush right into a corner to get at a bug. However, I am really pleased I bought this."
1,Failure to Suck,"After charging fully the unit made noise but completely failed to produce enough suction to perform it's intended finction of sucking bug into the tube. On flat walls it would have a slight chance of getting the bug, any other surface shape it would not work. Most bugs just moved away from the slight airflow. The design has potential but needs a massively bigger air flow. You almost have to get the bugs to crawl in, and catching them in flight, no chance. Very dissapointing, total failure. I would not buy this."
1,Worthless,"Honestly, this product was garbage right out of the box. It barely had enough suction to suck up small spiders and rarely killed them. I purchased it for my wife because she hates bugs and was always putting cups over them until I got home to handle them. She used it a handful of times but wasn't impressed and has gone back to using cups. It has sat in my attic for 2.5 years now and I will probably burn it the next time we go camping. I should have known when I stumbled across it in a SkyMall magazine."
4,Bug Vacuum is a winner!,"This is the perfect gift for my teenage stepdaughter as she heads off to college! Always one to freak out when she sees a spider or other bugs, I will continue to be her hero by proxy when she needs to bring out the vacuum. Reasonably priced, quick delivery, and easy to use."
4,Does the job!,This does what it says; only complaint is they should make the tube clear so you can make sure you actually got the bug! I bought this for my grown son who hates spiders and it really does do the trick!
1,"Bpa, endocrine disruptor?","Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year."
4,Surprisingly Melancholy,"I heard ""Vanilla Float"" while listening to Sirius satellite radio, and immediately bought this whole CD. On listening through the rest of the music, I am surprised at how melancholy it is. I think of soaring as a happy thing, but this CD emphasizes (at least, to me) the solitude and peace of solitary flight. It is a much more minor-key CD than I expected. I enjoy it, and it is relaxing, but it isn't exactly the bubbly, happy flying music I expected Soaring to be about."
4,Seiko Watch,Keeps good time. Very comfortable. Looks nice. The watch gained about 30 seconds daily out of the box. It took about a month to get it fixed - a bit of a disappointment. It works fine now.
2,"""Edited"" means Truncated","This version should be called ""Creature (incomplete truncated version)"" because Creature (Edited Version) ends somewhat abruptly in the middle of the movie. If your want to see the whole move there is a DVD version for sale from Amazon for $49.96 (as of 1/21/13)! I'd hate to think this is an intentional bait-and-switch marketing program. As for the movie itself, based on seeing the first half I think it is good for a made-for-TV movie, with an interesting plot, reasonable character development, appealing location shots, and mediocre special effects. I was engaged enough to be disappointed with the unexpected cut-off with no plot/story resolution, and I hope to see the rest of the movie eventually."
1,Issue with the Unbox version of this movie - it isn't what it's suppose to be!,"I purchased ""Creature"" thinking this was ""Peter Benchley's The Creature"" mini series from 1998 (as the picture shows and what the description above indicates.. This is NOT THE 1985 Klaus Kinski MOVIE ""CREATURE"" set in outer space!Not only that but the downloaded video from Amazon Unboz is the first 1 hour and 30 minutes of the actual 1998 mini series ""Peter Benchley's The Creature"" and it's missing the other 2.5 hours! This movie mini series was originally 4 x 60 minute episodes and this in NOT what you're getting when you download!Somehow no one has caught this up until now (March 1, 2011) or Amazon hasn't fixed it yet.. Sorry to be the bringer the bad news here (for those of you expecting to see the whole mini series or the Klaus Kinski Sci-Fi Space movie..[...]"
3,"It's ok, just ok.",When buying this CD I thought it had all the singers singing their hits. This is one singer (Jairo Vallera) & the quality of the cd is kind of grainy. Not a must have for 'Niche fans.
5,"Very clever questions that leave you saying ""What?""","My friends and I stumbled across this one in the bookstore and bought it on the spot. Hilarious, strange, and sureal stupid questions that leave you rolling on the floor."
2,History is very judeo-christian centered.,"Author couldn't seem to find much to talk about, only 30 pages prior to his discussion of biblical times. He manages to sidestep a lot of charged topics though, simply by leaving them out.The style of writting is both readable and enjoyable and the book itself is engaging. Unfortunatly it leaves out 90% of us humans who are not from that particular tradition in the ""west.""If you want a book that will reinforce the western centracism by all means read it."
1,"Not for adults, but not for kids.","One reviewer described this book as being like a 9th grade history book. He was being kind. It's more like a 3rd grade history book. Actual quote: ""Until five hundred years ago human beings weren't spread throughout the world, like jam on bread. Not at all. We lived in scattered clusters, like the hives of bees a farmer sets along the border of a field."" Seriously, this is how the entire book is written. There is a difference between writing for the general audience and dumbing down: Mr Davis doesn't seem to understand that difference. If you are looking for a serious, intelligent book about the history of human kind, look elsewhere."
5,"Beautiful, majestic, exotic, firey, ferocious gypsy mayhem.",Wow! These two stringed wizards go to town. Blazing acoustic guitars as well as all kinds of wild stringed instruments. I've played this CD for a number of my friends & they were completely mesmerized. Fresh & exciting. Reminds me of the Gypsy maestro Django Reinhardt. I highly highly highly reccommend it.
5,GREAT BAG...BUT WHATS UP WITH AMAZON'S PRICE?,"I PURCHASED THIS BAG FROM B&H PHOTO FOR $99. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY AMAZON IS ASKING $175.00, BUT MY ADVICE IS...SHOP AROUND!!"
3,"Great book, but mostly GUI only","This is a great book if you have one server.Pros:Clear language to explain what to do: click here...Cons:Not covering the scripts for repetitive tasks(like add new user,...).If you don't mind the extra weight and money, please take a lookat Mark Minasi's Mastering Windows 2000 Server (4th Edition)."
2,Not a great book,I read this book for a college course and I didn't find anything extremely enlightening about it. His arguments were obvious and others were confusing. There seemed to be a lot of filler material between claims; I guess I don't see the value of the book - it offered no insights into the root of nationalism.
4,Chasing rainbows,"I got this book because the author gave away another one of her books for free and I fell in love with her writing and her books are all reasonably priced and pretty long, something you don't usually find in kindle books anymore. New and interesting take on the western romance. Highly recommended"
3,Different tastes,"Guess people have different. They taste like Slim Jims with all the flavor and texture boiled out of them. Bologna sticks shaped like Slim Jims. Anyone want a box of 49?update: After some time I tried another. Not inedible. The more I ate, the better they tasted. I think I still prefer Slim Jims. A little more work to eat; spicier, with a little snap to the skin. But I'm raising my rating to 3 stars from 1.I couldn't find any nutrition information which I thought was required for food products made in the US. I don't really want to know what the put in these things anyway"
1,Received expired product,"I ordered this on April 29, 2011, and received it on May 2, 2011. The product expired in March. I am only giving this one star because that is the lowest rating that I can give. If it weren't for the one star minimum, I would give it 0 stars."
2,Expiration date is horrible,"So these sticks taste ok, I mean, it's jerky, how do you mess that up? My issue is with the expiration date, which was a little less than one month from when I got my box. How am I supposed to eat 50 of these things in 25 some-odd days? That's just cheap trying to offload these so close to the expiration date. Never buying these again."
4,Sooo GOOOOOOD,I bought these because I like meat snacks and Slim Jims are just way to greasy. I can't wait to purchase the next box.
5,A great set,"The Grand Titan, in my opinion, is the best among the 4 main Exo-Force mechs. It is pretty durable, aside from the two pieces above the arms, which come loose quite easily. This, however, is not a problem, because each is held on tight by a missile. The gattling gun rotates, and the light cord adds to the effect, with light coming through the gun. The pincer claws open and close, and they rotate, as well. My only gripe is that the armsdo not pose well at the top joint. You can put it in a multitude of positions, and it overall just flatout looks cool. I give it a 5/5."
4,The rascal is king!,"An excellent little book and quick read. The book is broken into two parts. The first part, Hero-Sagas, is, except for the first story, an abridgement of the Nibelungenlied. It tells the story of Siegfried and Kriemhild and their terrible ending. The second part, Folk-Tales, is filled with short stories where the main message seems to be that the cunning and quick witted will always win, especially against the proud. Not exactly the best morality message, but it is fun to see wits in action."
4,An film about a snippet of life.,"This film seems ordinary when watching it though interesting, but by the time the story comes to a close you realize you've enjoyed to whole film and that it's a beautiful story.I think this is a story that reaches out to all who watch it and that we can all relate to it on one level or another.It is an honest and lovely film, well recommended."
5,My life as a Dog,Great classic Film from Sweden Great plot and feel good movie I highly recommend this film Won't be disappointed with seeing this film
5,present,given to son and his family as a gift to commemorate their visit to the Macey thanksgiving day parade last year. special to them
3,light fantastic,"Good album, easy to listen to and typical 70,s music, worth a listen, not as good as their first album, titled La Leyla which has a cult classic in the song Garden."
5,Her melodies and words lift your spirit to fly.,"Having a wide collection of ""New Age"" music Lorellei is one of my favorite female vocalists. This album brings out the romantic spirit and puts you in a soothing dream world of love. I fly an ultralight and her music gives me the same feelings I get when I glide just beneath the clouds. I have been unable to get anymore information on this artist and am looking forward to her next album."
3,HHHHmmmmm...,"THIS WAS A DECENT MIX COMPILATION. THE MIXING OF HARD AND TRIBAL HOUSE TRACKS WAS SEAMLESS AT TIMES. BUT NOT ALWAYS. MUSIC SELECTION WAS GOOD. HE USES A LOT OF THOSE AMAZING SONGS YOU WERE TOO BLASTED TO REMEMBER, AT THE RECORD STORE, THE NEXT DAY. TO VICTOR: PLEASE LEAVE MADONNA OUT OF THE NEXT ONE; UNLESS ITS A RECENT TRACK.OVERALL, IT WAS OK. MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST!"
4,"Package says good for fish, poultry, veggies??? No mention of steak?","The pan arrived and looks great. Nice size for cleaning in the sink and no sharp edges.However, my immediate plan was to broil a steak. A great size for one, but would also work for two.The Amazon description says it is for ""meat."" However, the package specifically mentions ONLY fish and poultry.Is there some reason this should not be used for steak? (Obviously, I am not at home in the kitchen! Either the package wording or description wording should change to avoid confusing the kitchen-phobic among us... :-)I see no way to ask the seller directly, so I am including question in my review! I'm giving the pan a high rating on the assumption that it will work well..."
3,Hard to clean.,"I used the pan part of the pan to roast chicken in and it was SO hard to clean that I never used the pan again. I spent 45 minutes cooking the chicken and another 45 cleaning the pan. Having said that, it still serves the purpose that I bought it for. I needed a broiler pan and I wanted a stainless steel one rather than a non-stick pan. It works as expected, it's just hard to clean."
5,Works great for my purpose.,"I have a counter top oven (Breville Smart Oven, which I LOVE!) and this little broiler pan works nicely in it for just the two of us. Easy to clean. Steel is medium gauge - not super heavy, but not flimsy either. I found it to be just what I was looking for at a resonable price."
2,Not quite as nice as I had hoped for.,"I had been using a very simple, effective broiling pan with a chromed grill similar to one used on an outdoor BBQ for over 12 years. It was finally shot and beyond cleaning. I spent weeks looking for a small replacement at all the stores within 35 miles, and found nothing. This looked decent and via the user comments I opted to buy this pan.I've been using it for a few months now, and not overly thrilled with the top section, which I find to have much more metal than necessary to hold the meat, making cleanup a problem. It is too large to soak in our sink. I line the pan with aluminum foil, so the pan is no issue to keep clean.I will continue to look for another small broiling pan, but why re-invent the wheel here? There used to be fantastic small broiling pans already in existence that worked better, had easier cleanup with just a BBQ brush, available just about anywhere.I would not buy this one again unless it were my only option."
1,Razor Sharp Edges,"Some past reviews of the Broiler Pan state that the Broiler Pan had sharp edges and other reviews state that their Broiler Pan did not. All I can tell you is the Broiler Pan I received had very sharp edges, no question about it. I sent it back."
2,Disappointed mystery fan...,"Although this book does pay homage to the great Christie classic, Ten Litttle Indians (or And Then There Were None), it had none of the gripping and believable suspense that made Christie's so remarkable. The premise was promising and intriguing; however, the story ultimately felt contrived throughout. The conclusion, in particular, fell flat for me, as there was a distinct lack of suspense and the feeling that everything had to be tied up in a neat little bow with everyone (but one) living happily ever after. As much as I love a good (and even mediocre) mystery, this will probably be the first and last Bannister book that I will read."
1,DONT BUY THIS CHEAP PIECE OF JUNK,"Complete junk. It is super cheap. The plastic is so thin that with a few snowfalls, it split apart and is now useless. Don't buy the cheap one, it will cost you in the end. Also, the other reviews only say they just got it. Mine did not last a few months. In short, don't buy."
1,"Very cheap, too short","I got this grill cover from a local store known for selling cheap stuff, so I wasn't expecting greatness, just enough to cover it for the winter. When I installed it, it didn't cover the full height of the grill, leaving a good 12-18"" exposed on the bottom. Worse, still, less than a month after installation, one side of the cover has worn through where the handle of the grill is! Spend the extra money on a good grill."
3,WW11 World War Marine,Mostly now forgotten but hey we live today because this happened.I like to review the opposition first but good scenes and explanations is this movie but strictly historical if you are into this.Video pretty good and sound as well but it ain't no STAR WARS sound track so be easy.Enjoy I did
4,excellent player,I bought this player last summer before going away for 6 weeks where I had no computer access. Not only did it work wonderfully the entire 6 weeks but the space allowed me to load enough music so I never got too bored with any one album. When I first bought the player I did have a problem that the hard drive crashed but they were very helpful in replacing my product. The only other problem I have found is that the lock button became loosened after a year of use. The battery life is also perfect it lasts about 10 hours and takes about 2 hours to fully charge. Overall I love my rio.
3,Get a free iPod Video instead!,"Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod Video 60GB for Free! I got mine from this web site: http://getbestfreestuff.com/ipod-video"
4,Mixing bowls,The bowls are great. Not too heavy and I love the pad on the bottom. I do wish they were dishwasher safe.
4,Live Recording (applause occurs at the end of each complete work),"Ideally the applause would occupy separate tracks (so that one wouldn't have to edit it out), but at least there were no audience members participating (e.g. coughing) during the performances.The quintet of Francaix is among the better recordings available.__________________"
1,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this garden border for my brand new back yard thinking it would add a European/Parisian element (I went with the white border). Unfortunately, after setting them up my garden looked hokey and cheap...far from the goal.Installing these things was a real pain. They're 100% plastic and if your land isn't perfectly flat, installation is a total pain in the a$$ (my yard does not consist of rolling hills, but small natural lumps in the soil). They bend, they break and connecting them together is an annoying exercise.If I had to do it all over again, I'd spend the money on something metal or made of aluminum, etc. The quality here was really disappointing...b/c I wouldn't gripe about install if it looked good in the end. You get what you pay for folks."
5,looks nice but a bit cheap,"This little black fance was just what I was looking for. I had to buy two to fit around the patio, but the fit was perfect. They do the job but they are a little flimsy. Great for $10 or however much it was. If you are planing to leave it up for long term use you may want to invest in something that is iron or metal. I just needed it until we fixed the wood fence that goes out front. Easy to take down, but kind of a pain to put up. It never really stayed in place that well but I had it leaning on the curb of my porch so it looked ok. All in all this is just as it was described-"
4,Adorable,My husband and I saw it on a cruise and bought for 2 granddaughters for Christmas (11 and 8) who are serious animal lovers. I think they will love it too.
4,fun,"Despite the obvious tuning problems that most people had with this product, I found it really fun and easy to use. The small size allows maximum portability, and the range of keys allows quite a wide variety of songs to be played on it. I've never played a kalimba before ordering this one, so I was relieved to find that it was relatively easy to play (after tuning it and growing my thumbnails out slightly longer). I found the sound to be very aesthetically pleasing, except for the highest notes (shortest tines) which had a sort of ""thin,"" sound, but it didn't really bother me much. With a screwdriver, a piano, and a bit of effort, I was able to tune the kalimba to my liking. Also, after a bit of use, the tines can be tuned with some sideways wiggling and pushing/pulling. I think ordering this instrument was a great decision; my family and I are currently enjoying very much. It's really easy to make music with it and it can be taken anywhere."
4,"nice toy, late arrival","It is a nice toy, makes really nice music. I will not order from this vendor again. I was very disappointed in the delivery time, on this. It was bought for Christmas, and arrived two days late. The express mail I requested didn't happen. I was not charged for it, but it was indicated when I ordered it that I would receive in in two to three working days."
2,Nice LOOKing!... Weak sounding.,"I received this kalimba last night. At first open I was actually very excited how nice it LOOKED. I would have been proud to have this one in my collection. The item was described as new, however there were a few blemishes (which I would not have minded cuz it was under $50 bucks). I tuned it into it's proper range (B as bottom note). Tuning it isn't as bothersome as other people have commented. However, I immediately realized that the first two tines did not play right (the sound was muted and made ""thunk"" sounds. If you do decide to buy this kalimba - be careful cuz the dealer doesn't refund any of the shipping. I hope you don't get one with muted notes like I got. Also, the sound is not as strong as similar kalimbas - but just sounds okay. By the way, I don't have anything to gain or lose by commenting here. I was really hoping it would work out. (Returned it during my lunch break.) Thank you."
1,Let Down,"I normally read the reviews on things before i buy them and when i see someone rate something really low i think that they are just being debbie downers, but honestly, DO NOT BUY THIS it is a waste of 50 dollars. Spend the extra 50 and get a good one if you are really interested but this one came out of tune and its just... wrong. It was a total drag and of course i threw away the packaging like a donk so now i can not return it..."
3,Good but watch the errors,As the other reviewers state this is a good book for beginners to learn about the issues and parts of robotic devices. My concern is with the many many errors in the circuits presented in the book. This may lead beginners to frustration and despair.Especially regrettable is that many of these errors were present in the previous version. There really is no excuse for Mr. McComb not to have fixed these as this book is famous all over the Net for this very thing. I urge Mr. McComb to fix the circuit diagrams for the next printing of which I'm sure there will be many and to post an errata page on the Web somewhere.
3,Palm Treo 755 Leather Case,"This is a handsome looking case that fits the latest Treo (755) really well. The leather is soft to the touch and the case looks fantastic.However, the leather can be easily scoffed up so be careful. Also, the clip in the back of the case is rather stiff and unless you are wearing a belt, it's cumbersome and tiresome to attach it to your pants.I would definitely buy it if I had to do it over because I paid a fair price for it and the case does protect the phone well. I think the aspect of the case that is really annoying to me is to try to clip it onto my pants when I'm not wearing a belt. It's a struggle. If you like wearing belts all the time, the case should be perfect."
4,Welcome help to meditation,"This is a pleasant simple warm book, helpful for someone who wishes to meditate and is looking for a visual and emotional launch pad to put him/her self on the road."
5,Love This Book,"The author inspires me.He also happens to have been my brother. He was a talented artist and teacher. You can see by the dedication of the book, that he was humble and spiritual."
4,"Well, I like it!","It isn't the BEST THING that's come out featurning SRV, but come on! It isn't a bad assortment of performances at all and I actually enjoyed it (listened for the first time today). I love when new stuff comes out and this one has things that I'd either not heard before, hadn't heard in a long time or hadn't heard in this version. I'm a crazy SRV fan for sure...but not that crazy!"
2,Almost great,"Don't misunderstand me, I love Boston Legal. I think it is witty, charming, and on target in terms of the issues they tackle. But I'll never get to watch this final season. You see, unlike the previous seasons which were close-captioned, this one is not. Because of the deafness in my family, I'm unable to enjoy this one.To all of the studios producing family DVDs: please make captions a priority!"
4,A Sad Ending to one of TV's greatest Legal Teams,"I was distraught when Boston Legal came to an end. Because I quit watching TV back in November 2006, I didn't know that there was a last installment of Boston Legal. So I was excited to purchase this and see how the show ended.Well, it's fun, I'll give it that. And Alan and Denny get to stay together, which is a good thing considering what happens to the firm Crane, Poole and Schmit. But be aware that it's not a full season. Apparently ABC pulled the plug on this show before it can make a whole season, but it's well worth it for any BL fans (serious ones, of course)."
5,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!","A must-have for all Boston Legal fans. Season five continues the madness at Crane, Poole, and Shmidt, while wrapping-up the Boston Legal franchise with fun surprise endings that go even more over-the-top than usual (if you can believe that). More provocative cases, more grand humor, more satisfying plot twists, and more delightfully shameless breaking-down of the ""fourth wall"" between cast and audience. Best show I've seen in a great many years. Great writing, perfect acting, creative directing and photography - it's all in there. The only bad thing about finishing season five is that now we're in BL withdrawal. Come on Mr. Kelley - bring on the next classic! ;-)"
5,Denny Crain - Need I say more?,"The adventures of Denny Crain and Alan Shore, along with a changing support cast including James Spader and Candice Bergan make for interesting viewing while employing the David E. Kelly skewering of modern life."
4,Band of Brothers,This is a story that tells more than just the happenings of war. It is about the individual relationships of men assigned to a particular company. You willl watch certain individuals grow both as soldiers and as human beigns. You will be let down by them when they faulter and you will share in their pride when they are victorious. It's a great read!
4,Ambrose is great,"I rarely read history, the closest I get is reading war novels like ""The Bridges of Toko-ri or ""The Triumph and the Glory"", but Stephen Ambrose is such a gifted writer that I make an exception for him. ""Band of Brothers"" is a fine account of a unit of the famed 101st, I really enjoyed it."
4,An Interesting Look at this Elite Group,"The book is very interesting in that it takes an elite military group at looks at it from its initial formation all the way through the end of the war. Easy Company trains, drops into Normandy, and fights all the way across Europe and we get to follow. This book uses many first hand accounts of the men of Easy Company and gives the reader a sense of intimacy with those that faught ...Germany."
5,brilliant and just plain remarkble,this incredible story shows the hell these elite heroes went through and how they relied on each other to survive. Icould not stop reading! CURAHEE!
5,As good as the Miniseries,"What I liked about the book is that it focused on more soldiers. Also, the book told the ""true story"". The Book's stories were moved around for dramatic effect in the miniseries. Back to the book, it was written well and I enjoyed reading it very much."
5,Band Of Brothers - The Book,"Excellent! Ambrose has written an 'easy read' which eliminates the military 'strategy/tech-talk', and brings the hardships of WW2 down to his 'Citizen Soldier' level best; On almost every page, one can feel that very special bond becoming stronger among this special 'band of brothers'...start to finish.Seems even more meaningful and real if read within the context of the 'war stories' many of us have heard from relatives and/or friends who served anywhere in the ETO (As did my own father).Read the book, buy or rent the VHS/DVD HBO series, then read the book again. Well worth it.Steve"
5,Well written; a good read,I've enjoyed other books by Stephen Ambrose and this one didn't disappoint. I read it on a pair of trans-Atlantic flights and it kept me entertained the whole way. I just recorded the HBO show based on the book and am working my way through that also. Highly recommended.
4,Informative and Moving,"I really love how Ambrose took the stories of these men in the 101st and brought them to life. This was just a small sampling of the greatness of our veterans and men of WWII.I think he really personalized the war, but introducing the world to these heroes. They all deserved the recognition for their sacrifices. I think that it was well written, informative and I appreciate the fact that it went beyond the basic X's and O's of war.He humanized it and brought in several little side stories to bring these people to life. It made it more than just some dry history book.I am not the pickiest of readers, I just like a well informed, well written story. He shied away from the dramatics but kept me on the edge of my seat as I turned from page to page.I think this is an absolute must read for all WWII buffs."
4,A Touching Book,"Anyone who enjoyed the Band of Brothers mini-series on HBO, must read this book in addition. Although not as entertaining as the Hollywood version, the depth of each person, in addition to the heart of their struggle makes up for it all."
4,"Quick, interesting read","This book is one of those that once you get into it, you just fly through it. It is a very interesting story that just flows from chapter to chapter. I am sure this could have been much longer, but it really hits highlights, except for Bastogne which it went into some detail about. A couple reviews criticize this book for glorifying Easy company, but how can you say that--the book is about them and they were a great company. The book is not the whole US army. If it were...well that is another story."
3,Nice But Small....,It's a pretty ring. Has good color and a nice design. However the Diamonds are a lot smaller in person then the picture shows. In the future I might think of going just a bit higher in price for a bigger and nicer stone.
3,Find it at the library,"Book is an ok resource for quick study. The most helpful chapter is on high ticket rarities with a listing of some high demand books that while in high demand... are still circulating quite frequently. It's a good one to check out of the library, but don't rush out to buy this one .. in my humble opinion."
2,not up to burkes standard,"not a patch on the previous burke novels the ending was terrible I have4 read most of his novels and I am a great fan, but this was not good."
1,Repeated failures,"We have now had 4 separate Watts Intelliflow A2C units since our washer was installed in our second floor laundry room in February of 2008. This is a terribly unreliable product. Unfortunately, I have not found a reasonable alternative. The latest one failed after only nine months and I'm going to try and obtain a replacement under their warranty policy."
1,"Nice idea, flawed product","This sounds like the ideal solution to washing machine hoses which might burst at any time. It detects the electrical current of the washing machine and opens water valves only while the machine is active.The problem is that the product is so cheaply made that its almost impossible to install correctly. The threaded attachments for the water supply are cheap soft PLASTIC. As soon as you start to thread on the BRASS nuts that hold the water connections tight, you will cross-thread the nuts. The maker knows of the problem since they have a warning ""Don't cross-thread"" in their instructions. A better solution would be to build a product with a METAL valve body which might actually survive installation.Nice idea, but unless you are the most gifted installer STAY AWAY."
1,Apparently a piece of crap...wish I had read these reviews before,Ours was installed by a plumber about 15-18 months ago. The whole time we've had it I had to unplug the unit and plug it back in to get it working. Otherwise it thought there was a water leak and wouldn't start the laundry. Then after I came back from a week's vacation on my 4th load of laundry it started the water into the drum. When I went to add another item to the wash I realized it had stopped filling. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and the lights simply faded out. Our plumber asked if we had had a power outage...we had...over a week previous and I had done 3 loads already. Apparently this thing was a huge waste of money and I only wish I had seen these reviews before our plumber installed it. I'll be sure to tell him about these reviews.
1,"Worked great, for 5 years, replacement died on first use","We've had one of these hooked up for 5 years and it worked without a hitch. It suddenly stopped working and no amount of rinsing, disassembly, prodding, could get it to work again. Because it uses custom connections, and it had worked okay for quite a long while, decided to purchase an exact replacement from Plumbing Planet. This unit popped and sent sparks flying the first time I used it. Plumbing planet is being great about it, no-hassle return and refund, guess we're going back to a lever shutoff and good quality hoses :(Given my recent experience, and looking at recent reviews Watts, you definitely have a quality problem!"
4,The valve is working as advertised; retrofit installation easy,"It cost me $200 for a plumber to do a professional installation job. The existing water supply valves now serve as isolation valves. A special fitting was used to transition to copper pipes, 8 inches long, to this automatic shutoff valve. Screw the existing washer supply lines to the valve; drop the sensor into the washer's plastic pan, plug the washer into the valve and plug the valve into the wall. That's it. Now, when the washer is off, the valve shuts the water off. If the washer leaks while it is running, the sensor will shut the water off. The total cost of this installation is less than the deductible on my homeowners insurance policy."
2,Leaks!,"My daughter was disappointed by the product. She thought the concept was great, but once the dressing was added and the salad consumed, the left-over dressing somehow leaked. Sorry!"
5,Diverse and Hard!,"A great blend of late 80's/early 90's EBM (a la Front 242, Bigod 20, etc) with modern electro and Detroit techno. Totally suitable for the dancefloor on either an electro or industrial club night. Highly Reccomened."
1,Not Even Good Plane Reading,"I bought ""Sister Wolf"" on the strength of the cover, blurb, and awards it received. I needed something to read on a six hour flight to Dublin.The book was not engaging. I couldn't feel close to the characters, nor did I find their actions to be motivated by...anything.This is a dreadful book, and I had to force myself to finish it.Then, I did what I rarely do: I threw it into the trash."
1,What Shocks?,"I found ""Shock Treatment"" to be such a waste of time, that I threw out the disk the moment it was over.Shock Treatment is supposed to be the sequel The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It takes place entirely within a recording studio in Denton. While Brad and Janet are played by new actors, most of the other principle characters are played by the cast of Rocky Horror.It was nice to see old friends again, but they were put to no good use. The songs were horrible, the story incomprehensible. The movie was not shocking, or funny, or sexy, or interesting - or well done.Save yourself the trouble."
4,My Bloody Valentine...,"...10 years later. Not quite as good as MBV, but Valentine's one of my favorite bands ever, so it's not fair. However, if you liked the shoegazers of the UK circa early 90s, you should enjoy this. Poppy melodies, shimmering distortion, boy-girl vocals, plus Stereolab-like keyboards make this dreamfest stick in your head. The way I see it, since Kevin hasn't come out with an album since Loveless (and he's not going to), this will keep fans of MBV satisfied for a while. Oh yeah, they're Estonian, but they sing in English (not that you can discern the vocals, but they're printed on the sleeve)."
2,Unimpressive performance,"I just bought this and I'm unimpressed. The keys don't register unless you hit them dead-on. I thought this would give me an option when travelling of having a full-size keyboard so my hands wouldn't be so cramped. Trying to make all the keystrokes register is a real workout on the fingers and quickly tiring. Just like a non-electric manual typewriter. The cord/circuit box being on the right also interferes with right hand mouse usage. The instructions say not to fold it real tight so I don't know that it will be that much of a space saver in luggage. I can see where it would be good in a wet location, a kitchen or a dusty environment. The istructions say it is not compatable with oils or solvents so I guess it wouldn't be good in an automotive shop."
1,do not buy it!,"I ordered this grinder because it was not big and it looks nice ,for my mother.One grinding plate was missing.I washed all parts well,but during usage the meat was coming out dark color!..The grinding plate is very low quality and it was coloring the meat!...I washed it again and again, but same result: meat was coming out dark and I had to throw it away.I am hoping to get a full refund.Don't buy it."
3,The River Between,"A so-so book...pretty predictable....Since I've been enfrossed in Vince Flynn's books, this book was a break from his stories...I found it kind of boring. Maybe another time, i would try another by this author."
3,there must be something more informative than this,"I am not sure just what rubbed me wrong about this video. I got stuck on the instructors speech pattern, the camera angle missed important visual information many times, and I felt like the treatments were not first class. Many times I have seen Massage Nerd video's on you tube and thought they were interesting, but with this video I couldn't stop feeling annoyed? I hope they pull this one and refine it before they continue to offer to the public."
4,Whole Wheat Bread is better for you anyway...,"I saw these guys earlier this year in Jacksonville (where they're from) when they where touring with Tsunami Bomb (whom I've seen numerous times) and ...some other band -I think Lawrence Arms-, and they owned. They cram so much influence in their shows/music its fantabulously orgasmic. How many bands can get CRUNK, own the crowd with a riff-tastic punk song, have freestyle rap battles between songs, and beat out Tsunami Bomb (sorry, Agent M) for best band of the night? ...not many. These guys are some of the freshest dudes out there.I love black guys."
2,Stick to classical music,"I was so enthralled to ""discover"" Russell a few years ago - finally a tenor that is worthwhile listening to! This collection does not do Russell justice, it is mediocre at best. Russell, please stick to the music that made you famous - classical and opera!!"
4,"Russell, You've Done It Again!","Well, I have just read the 15 reviews on this CD. I too love Russell's booming tenor voice; however, I also love the softer voice he uses on many of these songs. My favorites are ""You Don't Know Me"" and ""To All The Girls I've Loved Before"". I have always loved this song, but when I heard the duet I just couldn't stop listening to it. In fact, I'm listening now. I just moves me, as does ""You Don't Know Me"". I got goosebumps when I first heard it. The only thing I wasn't too fond of is that some of the songs are sung very slowly. I do feel he chose wonderful songs for this CD. He is such a talent and I pray that he has some good luck with his health come 2008. He deserves it."
1,Beware of the strap!,"We purchased this a while back for our toddler daughter. She loves this toy and it keeps her occupied. Tonight though we heard her let out a shriek and were shocked when the strap was wrapped around her neck with all of the instruments in the drum. It had twisted a couple of times making it impossible for her to get it off of her head. She now has red friction marks on her neck from the strap, and the drum is now strapless. The design of the strap is such that it is split into two straps, connecting with Velcro in the middle. At fist glance my thought was that this was a safety feature and that the strap would release should the strap be used around the neck. The Velcro is strong enough that I had to strain to get the straps apart. So much for safety! We purchased this at Target for $20"
4,Good portable and powerful.,"Used this on last camping trip, and worked out just fine. Only drawback is not as effective for cooking meals for larger group of people. 4 to 6 people works great. Larger group will need something more powerful ( probably the portable stove which goes with the big propane fuel tank). This is definitely quite powerful for it size. It just take more time to cook meals for larger group. Might also want to order butane refills online since hard to find in stores. One refill canister would probably last about 50 to 60 minutes on high setting."
1,"It functions, Barely",I suppose I was spoiled by buying a commercial Japanese made version of this stove previously. It came and I tried it. The burner would not light from the piezoelectric ignighter. I had to light it manually and it seemed to burn lower than I expected. I returned it because it would not light correctly.The top black portion of the stove cover and pot support are enameled steel. It stores upside-down in the cheap flimsy storage case. I do not expect the case to last long. The stove seems to be good for occasional use. The fuel canisters can be difficult to find locally. They are available on Amazon and tend to be shipped motor-freight if you order a case.I love the extra gas burner that works much better than my electric stove top. If you want high quality then this is not it.
4,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"This is quite possibly as good as it's ever ganna get for this band. The lyrics are meaningful and intelligent, the music is well composed, and the album is well engineered and produced. Godhead have a typical neo-industrial/radio-gothic style that is hardley anything original....Nevertheless, it's the sincerity of this record that makes it special to fans. It's well worth checking out."
2,Could have been MUCH better........,"I was very dissapointed in godheads most recent release. Basically a once good band sold out to Marilyn Manson on his fancy new posthuman record label. On this CD their music sounds way too much like Manson himself. They totally lost all their origional quality. If you are at all interested in godhead, pick up their 1998 release Powertool Stigmata...this cd is far better...if you can actually find it...I believe that it has been long out of print on Sol 3 records."
1,Barker,"I have read quite a few books on this subject, and this one has to be the bigest dog. Rarely do you read something and feel like the author just put their hand in your wallet and ran away with your money.The information is so lightly touched upon, you feel dumber for having read it. I know that sounds harsh, but thats how it left me."
1,this phone didnt work very well,"i had nothing but problems with this phone. first off it was really static sounding. sedcond, it would change channels automaticly every few seconds and half the time it would get worse reception and the other half it would produce a loud buzzing noise that wouldnt go away till you manually changed the channel 3 or 4 times. if you live in a house or apt with walls that are thicker than paper, this phone probably wont work for you either. but the good thing, i took it back to the store )circut city) and they took the piece of junk off my hands once and for all."
1,horrible battery life,"I bought this phone, and followed the directions on charging it, but it still dies after 5-6 hours of being off the base, and if I talk on it for more than 20 minutes the battery dies. I am writing this in the middle of my search for a replacement battery, and if that costs too much i'll be getting a new phone."
5,Search is over the EJB book is here!,"If you want to master EJB, then the Mastering Enterprise JavaBeans is the right book for you! It covers everything from basics of the EJB to the more advanced topics like transactions, performance and clustering. You will also learn how to choose the most suitable EJB server for your project.Thanks to Ed Roman, et al for the most comprehensive book about EJB technology. I would strongly recommend this book to the community.P.S. Don't forget to download the source code from TheServerSide.com and enjoy testing what you have learnt!"
5,Hardcore Enterprise Java Beans...,"I browsed through various books on EJB's, and as expected, they all contain the same concepts and diagrams, as they are all based on the same J2EE specs; while some of them delved into the intricacies of a certain Application Servers(BEA's or IBM's), and other were Application Server independant, this book STANDS OUT between all of them.This is a ""HARDCORE"" book on EJB's, it goes into the deepest details regarding EJB design like Clustering and Transaction issues while avoiding the pitfall of detailing a certain Application Server.It also has great introductory tutorials on other EJB issues like JNDI and CORBA-IIOP, where other books seem to fall short.The other subject I found especially helpful was the best practices section, this shows that the authors have ""on-hands"" knowledge of builing EJB Systems, and gives you some incite on difficult to grasp concepts.All in all, this book is centered on ""the issues"", not the hype or Application Server."
4,One of the best in the market,"This book will set your foot in firm EJB ground, well written well done, although if you are new to EJB you may have little difficulty to digest the concepts at once, reread it to get the best out of it, I wish it comes with CD containing the codes"
3,This is a OK book,"I was looking for an EJB 2.0 book. I was planning to buy either this one or Enterprise JavaBeans, 3rd Edition. So, I went to bookstore and read this one. (Explanation is ok, but it didn't cover the very simple and basic things, e.g. for CMP 2.0 about primary key stuff...this book has just assumed you've known what is cmp primary key before you read this book... If I don't remember it wrong, it didn't even mention about the primary key has to be either Object or String... So, I guess if you are familiar with EJB 1.1, (like myself) you are gonna get confused... or may be just me.But I did find the appendix was useful. So, I rate it ""OK"" with three stars... I guess I'm just a tough rate-er, I've never rated a book with 5 stars. I'm going to buy the O'Reilly one, cuz I didn't find it in bookstore. I hope it will be a good book...)"
1,Misleading Picture!,Bought this item based on the picture thinking I'd get a Spray and a cream! It's just the spray. I'll have to pay more attention next time.
1,dumb,this is a whack movie not in agood way this isnt a movie its someone home video someone was bored this is a very low budget film why do they make these boring clown movies clowns are creepy it seem although it would be easy to make it into a grea horror but i havent seen a good clown horror yet if anyone know of a good clown horror please post it
2,Look Elsewhere,"This book is filled with fatuous anecdotes and virtually useless information. It is written by an agent about agents. There are few useful examples. A basketful of useless, hackneyed slogans and overworked stories, this book is a sad testimony to why readers have such a limited choice of well written creative books today."
1,Do not suggest,Billy Blanks: Ab Bootcamp is a mediocre Ab workout video at best. Many of the workouts I do not feel the crunch or burn at all. These workouts are for absolute beginners. And I would not even suggest the video to them. There are plenty of other great ab workout video's to spend your money on. Please do not waste your money on this. I am already trying to sell it.
5,A gem of a book!,"For centuries, Eastern and Western spiritual adepts have used a secret tool to promote positive, healing energy called the violet flame. Saint Germain is one of its foremost proponents. I'd recommend this book for anyone wanting to know more about this master and his tools for spiritual accceleration. Very interesting!"
3,Substance Disk 3 - Slightly incomplete,"Do you hate ""Best of"" albums that include ""new hit singles"" as much as I do? This album would be much better if it had dropped ""Let's Go (Nothing for Me)"" and replaced it with ""Confusion,"" ""The Perfect Kiss,"" or even ""Spooky."" Otherwise this is a good compilation."
1,huh?,"This is missing so many hits that I can only wonder what is the point of releasing? Your better off kicking with some mp3's until this label put's out a ""real"" best of."
1,Disappointment,"I picked this up, listened to it, and promptly sold it back to the local record shop. I've been a New Order fan since 1980, and have seen them too many times to mention here, but this is a very dyslexic and weak compilation. While it's true that Dreams Never End always makes me smile, most of this cd doesn't! The remixes focus on alot of forgettable items that should not be on ""The Best of"" cd for these folks. Save time and effort and take yourself over to the next rack and pick up Substance to get a fuller, more colourful array of their portfolio. They should have included more material from the first 4 albums on this cd rather than focusing on clearly boring material that came out later."
3,"This Collection is Lacking Some ""Substance.""","The legendary dance-pop act New Order released a dynamite greatest hits compilation, the double disc ""Substance,"" back in 1987. True diehard fans will no doubt prefer that set to this fluffy, single-disc retrospective. Some worthy inclusions surface (""World in Motion,"" ""1963,"" ""Round and Round,""). But why do we have to endure a useless 1988 remix of ""Blue Monday""? And what's ""True Faith"" and ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" doing on this set when they already appeared on ""Substance""? Those gripes aside, this is an okay collection for the bargain-conscious consumer, but serious first-time listeners should make the investment and get ""Substance"" instead."
5,oooh comfort!,"I have a problem with the latex on elasticized legs of underwear and the women's boy shorts are okay but curl up. So when I found these, I was in heavenly comfort! Love them, wear then under pants and they don't curl. Very soft and made in the USA! Gotta love them."
5,My search has ended!,In my search to find something I could wear under skirts that would help prevent chaffing yet be cool and comfortable tried the following:Ilusion Cotton PettipantsJockey Women's Skimmies SlipshortWickers Performance Underwear.Out of the above three - the Wickers Performance Underwear was hands down the winner:Pros:Made in the USA92% Polyester 8%LycraCool - BreathableLength - Mid ThighFits Well (true to size)Launders well (no shrinkage or pilling)Comfortable Elastic WaistBand (does not bind)Cons:None so farShipping was fast as well - ordered on Dec 6th and Received on Dec 10th.
3,Incomplete models listed - more info requested!,"It would be nice if someone that has bought this book would make a complete list of the brands and models covered, here in the reviews.Because the details section of the listing appears to be of limited length and cuts off at Homelite.I can hardly believe there's nothing on Husqvarna, John Deere, Jonsered, McCulloch, Pioneer, Poulan, Remington, Sachs, or Stihl (and I'm sure there are more beyond 'Ho...' that I don't remember) in this manual.Thanks!"
4,Very helpful,Detailed drawings and step by step instructions make this manual a good reference book in my library.
2,Clymer Chain Saw Service Manual,"This manual is highly inadequate, with very little useful detail. Other Clymer's manuals I have used have always been very detailed and useful. This one is not worth buying or owning. Don't waste your hard earned money on this product."
3,chain saw service manual,"Am looking at buying this manual have a few older chainsaws,eg alpina a40,stihl 023,maybe stihl 017, looking at the reports,look positive,but does it cover these models,regards David"
1,Adding to the garbage heap of the original,If the game the expansion is based on is garbage (and TA: Kingdoms is) why should I have to buy an expansion to make it a good game? And what guarantee would I have that it would become a good game? A friend of mine got this against my advice (I let him have the original).1. The game is still overly slow and clunky even on a PIII 500mhz machine. 2. The AI cheats to make units far faster than you can. 3. The unit AI stinks. They will not counter attack despite the fact that the unit RIGHT NEXT TO THEM is getting attacked. Their pathing is equally bad. 4. Unit variety is unimaginative. 5. Story lines are boring.Making an expansion to make garbage better still leaves you with garbage.Cavedog has thrown real-time strategy back 3 years.
2,Once they said God himself couldn't sink her,"A group of Americans are interested in raising the ill-fated Ocean liner Titanic. One of the team members finds out the Russians also have plans to raise the ship from its watery grave. Seems that a rare mineral on board could be used to power a sound beam that will knock any missile out of the air when entering us airspace, causing a race to raise the ship. The script and acting are pretty flat. Since this was made in 1980, you have to keep that in mind when watching. When they finally get to raising the ship, the effects are quite good and worth watching just for that. I would give this film 2 1/2 stars. Upon release, the film was poorly received by critics and proved to be a box office bomb"
2,Uhh - stick to his old stuff,"Gazebo isn't my most favourite Italo disco star but he could deliver some good tunes in the 80s. And what is this new release? Of course, we gotta remix. Modern Talking put rap in their new versions of the old songs, so did Fancy, C.C. Catch, Bad Boys Blue. Gazebo followed the bad examples and, on top of all, made it so slow... I mean ""I like Chopin,"" that beautiful classic which opens this album but is not so beautiful anymore. And the rest of the disc is just disapointing, whether it's remixes or new creations, just does nothing for me. I'm sorry if I offended some fans but come on..."
5,"An awesome, must read book for everyone.","A thoroughly comprehensive book on what happens when God's people pray. Pastor Cymbala relates personal testamonies and stories from his congreagation on the incredible power of our Lord and Savior. A must read for any Christian with enough Gospel in it to save the lost. Very easy to read, and quite moving."
5,"How to ""do"" church. This is what it's all about.","My pastor showed us a clip at church one Sunday of Jim taking a beating during an alter call. The man kept on preaching. I found this book first and my going to church has changed from It's about me to it's all about God.If you want to know what the church is all about, then read this story. It melted my heart and renewed my Spirit within me. As a Christian I am the church and I love Jesus and this is the way to ""do"" it."
4,"Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire","I have read the book twice and it has been great both times. Shows us the importance of prayer over most organized church service. Although, we need both."
4,Worship by Prayer,"As Cymbala points out early in his, the Scriptures never are called a House of Sermons - but God and Christ Himself said that ""My house shall be a house of prayer."" The late 20th Century and early 21st century church have turned it all on it's head. The church needs to return to its Acts 2 roots and get serious about both corporate and individual prayer."
4,Even better graphics! But new additions to learning...eh..,"I loved the new great even more realistic graphics! But I did hate the quizzes that you have to do in the temple of the museum. I liked how you travelled and you did learn quite a bit about the Mayan culture because of the quizzes, but it was frustrating having to go back and forth around the museum to find answers. Pretty freaky too! As usual of course. It was a good story and plot and the game was of course fun like always! They also give a laptop for you to use so you can keep track of notes easier and you don't have to waste a bunch of paper! But I hate how you have to scroll ALL the way down just to look at the lastest notes you have! Despite all the bad parts, which is very little, it was still a good game and very enjoyable! :)"
3,Not very challenging,"This was the first Nancy Drew game that I tried. Compared to most of the other games in this genre this is not a very difficult game. It is probably aimed at children around the age of 10-12. The story is very nice and you do end up learning a lot about Maya culture, putting this game in the edutainment category. The graphics are way below par and the interaction is mostly Myst like. There is not much depth added to the game to make you feel for the character you are playing.Overall it is a good game if you are taking a break from the tougher adventure games, and do not really mind the graphics and clumsy interfaces."
2,Scarlet Hand is less fun than Castle Malloy,"Since I bought Scarlet Hand I will try to solve the puzzles, but The Haunting of Castle Malloy is more fun to play, in my opinion."
4,The hardest but not the best of the games,"This has to be the hardest of the Drew games,but its not the best.The storyline is so so.The characters are not as developed as other games in the series.The game was ok in my opinion.Its not as boring as The Final Scene or Secrets Can Kill.A improvement on Herinteractives part.Cant wait for Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake."
4,A Little more information than we needed......,"This was a pretty good game although the mayan info was very wordy and way more detail oriented for ""age 10"" which they set as the age limits for this game. It involved alot of note taking and a bit too much detail work. I'd say more like 14 and up. I applaud Her Interactive though for bringing out this whole series. Mostly, they are great fun and continue to get better and better."
2,Not the best Nancy Drew....,"I am generally a big fan of the Nancy Drew games - I love adventure games and found that Nancy Drew games are not just for kids. However, I really was not thrilled with this one - the tasks and puzzles seem to be WAY too drawn out. After a while it seemed like such a chore to get thru a task. Even consulting a walkthrough, I got bored real quick - and got to a point where I just could not sit thru it anymore. The only other game I've stopped playing in the middle of it was ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"".I thought Message in the Haunted Mansion was far more fun."
3,Okay,"Scarlet Hand wasn't one of my favorite ND games, great graphics but tedious in the gameplay. There are lots of long, boring tasks of organization and retrival that just keep coming. Unless this is what you are looking for, I would suggest a different ND game. On the plus side, it did have a good ending."
1,Lack of Substance,"I learned almost nothing from this book except for Kelly's Criterion, which you can get a better explaination on wikipedia for free (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion). This book is a lump sum of everything: half cooked biographies of Bell Lab scientists, fragments of mafia histories and a little bit of gambling theory. It's been a waste of my time though there are patches of entertaining moments."
3,interesting but rambling read,the author ties together a number of disparate stories but the key takeaway from a practical perspective was: manage risk and do your homework.
4,A Nice Little Read,Easy and interesting. Gets a little bogged down in detail about half way through but worth the effort. Especially liked the straightforward writing style.
3,fatan mas datos tecnicos,"el producto al parecer es bueno,pero faltan datos tecnicos, como para poder interezarse en el producto. el precio es conveniente"
5,The Legend Continues!,"Another fantastic entry into the series of 26 films. This is easily one of the best film series ever made. And this film is another 5 star in the series. The combination of comedy blended with just enough dazzling swordplay really puts this film over.A great film and if you are lucky enough to own a copy count your blessings. It took the grace of God for me to find a copy out there for less than $95! I cannot understand why out of a 26 film series with all other titles available numbers 9 and 11 are the only ones unavailable.These are great movies. The Zatoichi series is a classic and they should be avaialble for the public without having to pay ridiculous marked up prices.Please someone, somewhere listen to the fans!"
2,It's not worth the price,"I ordered two of them. I tried one first and returned the other. It's not worth the price of $1000. I installed Toto G500 washlet integrated with the toilet bowl. The total cost was $1700. It has all the functions which Kohler bidet has plus auto close/open lid, auto flush functions. The dry air function on Kohler is pathetic where as Toto's far exceeds the expectations. Kohler does not make this bidet seat itself but a third party makes it from them and Kohler just put their name on it."
3,John Wayne Book,"This was good reading for a true John Wayne fan. I have read maybe 4 books on him, and this was worth the purchase. I found many new things about Duke, wished for more though. Easy to read."
4,A heartwarming read about a great man,"This is a wonderful book. I grew up watching a lot of his films and I remember the day he died, stunned by the news. From this book I learned about his politics, although for me that was not as interesting as the anecdotes during filming, or his personal life with his trusted friends. I must say, though, that as I chronologically followed his life I became sadder as I knew how it ended. The last chapter is a harrowing read because this Big man wastes away and he knows it, he fears it. I closed the book feeling depressed and very aware of my own mortality."
5,Get it,"You've undoubtedly heard that CD's are ""dead"" and before this disappears forever, get it. I have to admit, if it hadn't been for ""Steel Magnolias"" I would have never known Delerue, but after purchasing this CD I was stunned by the number of familiar movies he had scored and the quality of the music."
4,a nicely done book,"Renaissance Lives: Portraits of an Age by Theodore K Rabb. This nicely done book, based on the PBS Series, is an excellent reference for the understanding the important people during the renaissance. It gives the reader a clear picture of the famous folk (and some not so famous) that an educated person living during the sixteenth century would be familiar with. Renaissance Lives: Portraits of an Age gives a synopsis of the lives of 15 men and women from Galileo Galilee to a merchant named Gluckel of Hameln. Covering England and Western Europe, the living history aficionado is provided with yet another great aid for the performance of their art."
2,The original of Reds,"I have to say that John Reed's Ten Days That Shook The World works more as a period piece today than as history. Still, you might look at the guy as an early example of what Hunter Thompson called, ""Gonzo Journalism."" Reed was reporting history as he saw it happen. There is always something to be said for that."
4,Excellent but lacking,The program works great just like always. I like the ability to create an image on the same hard drive you are imaging. But it would not do an image of a Windows 2000 Server which what I really wanted.
2,great-- *IF* it works for you,"The problem with Norton Ghost is that it seems to have problems with some computers and settings, and if it does, it is impossible to get it to work, or to get any meaningful help from the folks at Norton.My wife and I own different Toshiba laptops. For hers, Ghost works perfectly. For mine, installing Ghost causes my computer to blue-screen every time you turn it off, and it never successfully made a backup.As a PC technical support guy, that's what I see in the world. When it works, it's golden. When it doesn't, no power on earth will budge it.Buy it, and if it doesn't immediately work for you, uninstall it and move on to some other product."
1,Advertised features don't work or only very limited!,"This software is very dissapointing.The advertised USB support does NOT work with nearly allexternal USB drives. (E.g. Maxtor onetouch drives).You cannot get tech support except for lots of money per incedent (about as expensive as the product itself).The 'knowledge base' for this product has virtually nothingto say of any value, either.This is a case where the advertising is rather fraudulent.Don't advertise USB support if it hardly works for anything.The whole point of the software should be that you can backup an image to an external drive via USB."
1,Terrible!,"It hung my XP machine shortly after installation. Luckily, I was able to un-install it and get my machine back without too much heartache. I then ordered and am now using Acronis' True Image, which works great."
4,Images Hard Drives,"[...]If you want a tool that allows you to image your hard drive and/or to make backups of critical data, Norton Ghost 9.0 is the product for you.I've been using it for three weeks, during that time making a full disk image and daily incremental backups to that image without a hitch."
1,Ghost 9.0 is really a Ghost,"I have never had a product perform as badly as this one has - it simply is a very slow process, it doesn't deliver an image that is complete or actually makes a boot image as promised. I want to return it."
1,should be buried with yeterday's garbage...,"it's hard to say which fox film is the worst. there are more laughs in the l and h silent habeus corpus than in all the fox films combined! it's so easy to see why stan loathed them.amazon now has a box of ten l and h sound films at a fantastic price. if you like the boys, this is the path to take."
1,A kids book,This book is a waste of money. Just goes to show what some internet marketing and advertising can do. It is very simple and most of the information on each fish species can be gleaned from a simple field guide. The uses of each species and catch rates are nothing novel. As for the illustrations this is what they are - hand drawn and not very good. Money would be more worthwhile spent on a good fish field guide.
3,On the SAAB 9-3 this filter noticeably lets turbo noise through -,Did feel a performance increase - supprisingly noisier than the dense paper element - also - beware about oiling up these filter too much - they can foul the mass airflow sensor with the filter oil ..!!
2,Not as strong as Volume 1,"It seems like Warners used up the best cartoons for Volume 1. I would really love to see the old Tom & Jerry Show from Saturday mornings. It had the best theme song and was a lot of fun. Since I grew up with that cartoon, it took me years to warm up to the classic ones where they chased each other. Of course all the Looney Tunes are incredible, but I have most of them on DVD already. Shazan is ok I guess. I loved Banana Splits as a kid, though find it hard to watch on Boomerang now. I can't say there is any other selling point here for me other than the Tom & Jerry Show."
4,"Playstation one graphics, get Beserk instead","I wanted a game like Sowrd of the Beserk for my dreamcast. So I made the mistake of buying NC part 2. It is such a horrible game. The poor graphics made me feel as if I were playing a playstion, and the hero of the game looks like a zombie himself.The sound is alos horrible. There is little to no music. The only things that you hear are raindrops, or a leaking pipe.And unlike most other scary games, this one has no gorey movies."
5,Travel this road,"Apart from buying a more comprehensive collection, such as The Sun Years, a three-disc set released by Charly Records, this is a fine way to survey Cash's Sun recordings. What I would ask from this collection are a few more tracks--alternate versions of Folsom Prison Blues (though available on other releases) and I Walk the Line. However, the tracks on this collection shine a little more brightly by the absence of the more popular tracks, which makes it a very good collection that you should put in your CD collection."
4,Scrappy early album by this lively rockabilly-boogie band,"A scrappy, silly, sometimes sinister set of rock-and-billy hybrids from this esteemed Canadian crew. The production, particularly the vocal mix, is sometimes rickety, but the music is vibrant and alive. The use of the violin in a rockabilly/hillbilly boogie context is interesting and unusual; might not make the snobbier, purist elements of the rockabilly scene happy, but it's kinda cool from an alt-country perspective."
3,Frankly Boring!,"A tiring read but, yes, I agree, with flashes of brutal frankness. This is one good example why a plain narrative doesn't always work as a work of art. Pekar as a street-fighter gets repetitive, so does his Jazz explorations. I must add autobiographies always bore me to death. Frankly not worth my investment! I haven't read any of Pekar's American Splendor yet. If I do, I won't be buying them until a few ""borrowed"" ones hook me by my throat."
4,Compelling,"I read through this comic book/novel in two or three sittings. I found it hard to put down. It's essentially an autobiography with drawings--wonderful drawings. The overall tone is serious, almost bleak, but in that good, existential kind of way. If you like the Harvey Pekar p.o.v., which I do, this book will satisfy."
5,"This was a great movie, I hope the Disney remake is as good","I saw this movie for the first time when i was about 6, im only 20 so for an old movie it did very well in my eyes."
5,"Mighty Joe Young (1949)-First saw it when 5, never forgot it!","I first saw Mighty Joe Young (1949) when I was five years old with my mom at the old LUXOR theater in the Bronx. At five it left me with an impression I was never able to forget. I would have rated it a five ""wow"" film (not being familiar with the star system of rating). When I recently watched this old film again its story and special effects still impressed me and I rate it four star film. Nicely done!"
3,capsules too large for cats,"No cat can swallow these capsules. Since my cat eats canned food, I am able to open capsule and mix into food. If he only ate dry food, I don't know how I would feed this to him."
4,Coenzyme Q10 for Cats and Dogs,"The seller was good in that what was promised was delivered, shipping was fine also. The only problem is that the capsules are a bit too large for my kitties to have to swallow, and it stated that this was for cats and dogs."
2,Thought I was getting new packaged mousetraps,"These mousetraps are not packaged ""new"". They are just the mousetraps placed in a box. it is not clear if they are recycled, cleaned, etc. as I thought I was getting new mousetraps packaged as individual traps or possibly 2 or 4 per pack."
2,Very flimsy slipper,"I was very disappointed in this slipper. It is very flimsy and thin. The sizing was not very accurate either. I wear an 8 med in womens and the medium was too small. They are comfy, but more like thin socks than a slipper or house shoe."
4,Not a bad product for the money if it works and doesnt break,"The point at which the tool contacts the drive shaft should have a spindle design. This way the metal on metal contact for rotation is limited. The pointed tip offers a lot of metal to metal friction which will break the tool if torque pressure exceeds 150 psi. I can compensate for this by putting a washer between the spindle and the drive shaft but the tool may slip off under high stress.I give it 4 stars because its a hard to find tool. If it holds up under use, then it's worth it."
4,Help!!!!!!!,"I loved "" The Brothers"" sondtrack. It had just about every song I expected and wanted to hear. Unfortunately the CD did not have one song listed which was the main reason I ran out to purchase the CD! I'm getting married in May and when I heard the song "" I Do"" by Mark Middleton, I was convinced that, that would be the perfect song for my wedding. It's funny how it's listed on the credits but not on the soundtrack! I've been searching all over the internet and I cannot find it! Can somebody help me please!!!!!! If you don't know what I'm talking about, the song plays near the end of the movie when the parents re-marry. Your response to this matter would be greatly aprreciated!"
4,HELP PLEASE!!!,"I absolutely love the album, except one thing where is the the song from Mark Middleton ""I Do"" I can not believe they left this beautiful song off the soundtrack what were they thinking..."
3,Made to Stick,"This ""book"" was not complete. Although the first parts capture you, the remaining ""pages"" need more to hook you into buying the rest of the book."
1,Made to make money,"This is a rehash of a couple of simple and well known ideas.If you can think up an idea that will shock ( a memory techneque) and you have a deep understanding of the culture and market your selling into then you have the guts of this book.You hook the ideas in the market to the shock perception and people remember and become curious.First have a deep understanding the culture and market , the hard part .In my unhumble opinion Made to stick is another example of book cobbled together to make money.With the clever marketing technique they espouse-""Made to stick"" and a review that must have been from a friend .Fortunately the library paid for this privileged information."
4,"A ""How To"" create effective business communications","Overall, this was a good book; it provides the reader with important insight as to how important it is to create a message that is understood and remembered. It also gives you a step-by-step process on how to create these memorable messages. Make the message 1) simple 2) unexpected 3) concrete 4) credible 5) emotional and 6) a good story. This is one of the more important books on how to get your business message communicated, and it tells you how to do it.The only reason that I didn't give this book a 5 star, is that the middle of the book was a real yawner - the book could have been just as effective (or more effective) at 200 pages."
4,What seperates great from good.,"Have you ever wondered why some ideas seem to stick and others don't ? This book explores exactly why some ideas seem to have this ""stick"" quality more than others. It was a surprising topic, but as I read, I realized just how critical this quality is to the success of any plan, campaign, or marketing strategy. Entrepreneurs everywhere will find great wisdom in this book. It contains many applicable ideas, and is a very enjoyable read."
5,great lessons in getting your point across,"Practical and specific information which I hope to use to my advantage in communication with my physician colleagues. Engagingly written. I was both entertained and enlightened. If you enjoyed ""The Tipping Point"" by Malcolm Gladwell, this book is a great follow-up."
4,"good, but not great","It was a good enough book, but the best parts are in the introduction and the first chapter. The other parts had some nice stuff, but I found myself either skimming or skipping whole pages! I would recommend the free introduction (available right here on amazon) to see how you like it, bu t be warned: the introduction is the best part!"
4,Lots of Useful Information,"Normal people, with normal jobs, with great ideas that STICK. This is the premise of this well-written book about how and why some ideas work, and others fail. As someone who works with non-profits, I enjoyed this book alot, especially in light of its simplicity in presentation and ideas to assist in GETTING to a ""sticky"" idea - one that will work for whatever your aim may be. Lots of good tips, with great examples. Probably a bit on the dry side if you're not interested in marketing, but I enjoyed it very much. Lots of useful information that I will take with me."
4,Veteran reviews Made to Stick by Heath.,"Insightful take on timely marketing influences you may not have considered, or maybe not as focused as this book does. Good read for marketers who need to compete and marketers who seek the 'edge' needed to win in an ever more demanding market."
3,"Good stuff, but an extended article could cover the idea","I enjoyed the book, but felt like the authors' core ideas had been covered or predictable by the time I got to page 120 or so. No doubt, there are compelling things in here. However, I felt that the Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible Emotional Stories theme is something that could have been handled well in the context of a 25- to 30-page article.For my money, a better option is Cliff Atkinson'sBeyond Bullet Points: Using Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 to Create Presentations That Inform, Motivate, and Inspire. Yes, I know what you're thinking...a book about PowerPoint is your preferred option? No. It's a book about storytelling."
2,"Caveat Emptor - Not complete book, only part","This ""book"" is not a book at all but only part of a book. ""Made to Stick (Introduction and Index): Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die (Kindle Edition)"" is what it says, only the Introduction and index and serves merely as a tool to get you to buy the book in serial chapter format at about 2.39 each. {$2.37 * 7(free intro, 6 chapters and an epilogue)=$16.73}So you see, if you want to buy the book, it would be cheaper to just buy the whole thing (Kindle version)for 9.99 from here."
5,Great ideas deserve well crafted messages,"Communicating a great idea poorly is like having the best BBQ pork ribs at the Vegan jamboree. If people don't understand or remember my idea then I've squandered its greatness (and how often will I have a great one anyway). This book teaches how to get those Vegans to tell their friends ""I bet those are damn good ribs."" We spent a long time learning how to analyze and create ideas. Spend some time learning how to share those with others."
4,An Informative Guide and Reference,"Keeping it simple really keeps people tuned-in. Authors and brothers, Dan and Chip Heath break down the common factors that keep some ideas around for years and leave others out on the street. Primarily a book on effective communication, Made to Stick, is a valuable, easy and fun read drawing on examples and years of research by the authors.SUCCES - Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotion and Stories are the common factors which make certain ideas stand out. Urban legends, for example, are simple, full of detail and unexpected events. Made to Stick investigates case studies from business, teaching, advertising and sports throughout the book while discussing concepts such as Gap Theory, to demonstrate how certain ideas inspire attention and interest."
5,Brilliant. Five Stars,"Try this - Read the introduction and the first chapter and tell a friend what the book is about. If you're anything like me, you'll realize that you've miraculously absorbed virtually every ""sticky"" example given along with the reasoning and methodology, without even thinking about it. The book practices its own preaching, making it not only everything you'd hope for in a book of this nature, but living proof that it works. Its very form supports its message, all the way down to the fluorescent orange, textured cover. Absolutely LOVED it."
5,Fantastic...Life changing knowledge,"The book is very well written and backs up the stories they tell with examples and research. It even has learn-by-doing ""clinics"" that help you develop your skills.I highly recommend it to everyone trying to communicate any message with other people either in person, writing, or using the Web.One of the top 5 books I've ever read."
2,Kindle version NOT the current version,"An important note for potential Kindle version purchasers: as of mid-July 2009 the Kindle version of ""Made to Stick"" is not the 'current' 2008 version of the book but the original 2007 version. Thus a new chapter in the back of the book is missing from the Kindle version. Now...let me be perfectly clear...I am loving this book so far and can confidently tell you the CONTENTS merit at least 4.5 stars. The first bona fide chapter alone is worth the price of admission. My paltry granting of stars is strictly based on my comments about the KINDLE VERSION. My advice: Buy the book in hardcover form. Yes, I bought, returned, and then repurchased the Kindle version. But this is strictly so I can validate for my wife that I'm using the $300 ""investment"" I just made in the Kindle itself. And I'll go back to the hardcopy version to read the added verbiage. Save yourself the trouble and buy the hardcopy version."
5,Max Goes to the Moon,Wonderful!! One can read these books over and over and learn something new each time. They are loaded with science and are informative to all levels of budding scientists! I highly recommend them!
4,Good book for beginners,If you are just beginning to making banners this book has good information on how to get started.
5,Perfect For Air Travel!,"I recently took a trip to North Carolina to visit family and was needing a carrier for my dog. I looked at all the pet stores and all over Amazon to find a good bag that would fit the requirements for air travel. This bag was perfect. I flew on American and the plane was and S-80 and the bag fit perfectly under the seat in front of me. My 11 lbs. Chiweenie had plent of room to stand up, turn around, and lay down (which was one of the requirements of the airlines). I was worried about the quality of the mess sides. I had read in previous reviews that some dogs tore through the sides. My dog was scratching a lot when you first put him in the bag, but it withstood the whole trip. I look forward to using this bag again if I make any travel arrangements with my dog. I highly recommend this bag for those traveling with small dogs under 16 lbs."
4,Great book for any student of leadership,This book was recommended to be. It looks like is has very good information. Can't wait to read it over the Christmas break.
1,How to Hire People Book,"This book is great with ideas, checklists, and disciplines on how to take time and care in the hiring process. If anything the book tell you to slow down when hiring and and be constructive.But having a bunch of A players with a B/C Executive Management at the top, will get you no where. I think the writer trys to project, or accredit, all or too much of the accomplishments of the companies in his book to his hiring approach. Also the writer seems to spent a lot of time, pumping topgrading. After a while I got sick of hearing the word Topgrading over and over throughout the book. All that is here are some very sound hiring practices, nothing unique or earth shattering.Hiring A players without the proper culture first, is a waste of time. A players are high achievers, and Management has to set the culture first."
1,Big letdown,"This is little more than a promotional flyer which you can download free from their website. It's a ripoff, don't bother. The ideas may be good but you can't evaluate it from the blurbs in this advertisement posing as a book."
2,"OK, but not the best","This book is OK, but certainly not up to the level that it is being hyped by friends of the author. There are other much better books out on recruiting and retention."
2,The author is not an A Player,"This book contains a staggering number of grammatical errors. Too bad Mr. Smart doesn't follow his own advice and put himself in the top ten percent league of writers.If you're into ""topgrading"", be sure and do some research into what companies are doing it and what their affiliations are with the author."
1,Tired of the Come On,"As a single ""Soul Kiss"" has a great jazzy, breezy feel to it. The rest of this album is full of cheap and sleazy stuff. If you want to hear Olivia do what she's best at, pick up ""Back With A Heart"" instead."
4,Soul Kiss=SEXY!,"I'm not that big of an ONJ fan. But I will admit that she has a beautiful and sensual voice. But the songs I do love by her I really do love a lot. Such as Physical, Twist of Fate and Xanadu. But far and away my favorte song by her is Soul Kiss. It is a VERY SEXY song!!!! and says far more than any trically love ballad. I listen to it all the time and that is why I am giving this album four stars. I agree with the previous reviewer the mix is also fantastic. My second favorite song by her is ""I Need Love"". Another very hot and sexy song!"
4,"Tantalizing and enticing, a G rated akira on the moon","Well maybe not quite akira but it does have Otomo, some future cycles, teen rebellion, social unrest a secret kept from the population etc...The music is catchy the animation is good and the story is an all ages affair. I give it 3 views."
1,terrible stench,"I was so happy when I got the parcel, but when I opened it and sniffed This, I thought it was some kind of joke. I could not believe it's the smell of perfume! what woman would use it ????? even my grandma said that stinky perfume, and that the water from her toilet smells better!I have wasted my money....."
1,Not my Chopard Casmir,"I had recently run out of my long time favorite Casmir and ordered it at Amazon. The perfume had turned. It has a strong acrid smell not even remotely associated with Casmir. Then, I found out that Amazon does not honor returns on liquids. Never thought I would have this problem, but I do. And I will accept responsibility. Must have been stored somewhere where the heat got to it. Beware before ordering."
5,"cjafrom Guatemala, I read it seven years ago","I really enjoy the book, it tooks me a more or less five days to read it. I love Jim Morrison, his music, his way to focus life. when I watched the movie, it wasn't the same, cause they give it another focus. The book really show us and tell us every little detail of his thoughts, moves. Well in fact whe you are reading the book you are really there, in the scene that's he was living. I had the book in spanish version, but the I lend it to somebody who never give it to me back, and now I need to find the book, if you can help me, I rather to get it in Spanish version."
5,no one here gets out alive,"it was written well, and told me all about Jim Morrison. It was also well detailed."
5,It made me a true DOORS fanatic.,"The book was mainly about the life and death of Jim, but it also focused on the aspect that Jim did not want all the credit. He valued his fellow bandmates as much as they valued him. This is the only bio of Jim and the Doors that I have read so i can not compare it to any other bio's fairly. It is a very good book, co-written by someone very close to Jim and an obvious Doors historian, Danny Sugerman. The book provides us a view of Morrison from the people who surrounded him and loved him."
2,An entertaining Waste of time,"I first read this book when I was fourteen. At that time I was the intended audience. While it is full of facts, it completely lacks any insight. All attempts at understanding the inspiration behind Jim Morrison's behavior were totally sophmoric. This is definitely a book that was written to sell copies by glorifying his excess. Like the movie, it is thoughtless and shows no understanding of its' subject. It damages the memory of a very human figure. The writing is callow and the man it portrays is an immature person's(read the writers) fantasy of what it would be like to be a sybaratic rock star. If you are really interested in some insight into the man, read his writings. If you want to get a personal sense of this creative force, whose life was really a tragedy, read Patricia Kennealy's Strange Days: My life with and without Jim Morrison. You'll get a lot more humanity for your buck. Paying for this book is like buying a Jim Morrison slurpee cup."
3,Convenient but not durable...,"Softens in the microwave, then I have to double up. I thought they wouldbe as strong as the Stalkmarket bowls. No worries...498 to go!"
5,Effective for Mange,This is another product that was recommended by my vet but is cheaper here on Amazon. It cleared up a spot of mites on my pit bull quickly when used as directed and is localized rather than a systemic treatment like a dip. The down side is it is a bit messy and could rub off onto furniture so be aware of this before you use it if you have light colored sofas (the product is yellowish).
4,M*A*S*H begins to hit full stride....,"Season two is definitely a step up from season one. The actors seem to feel a little more relaxed with each other, and it shows through the ""pace"" of the dialogue. Well worth the money spent for this season......"
5,One of the best TV shows ever,MASH was wit and wisdom. The TV series took the ideas of the original movie and improved it; surviving all of its character changes without suffering. This show actually improved with time. This DVD collection is also one of the best organized I have seen. The menu is fun and easy to use and the option of watching the episodes without a laugh track is a sensational idea. Watching the show in French for those of us who study the language is not too bad either. There may not be much in the way of special features but in this case I prefer to have more episodes per DVD than to have extra features. If you are a MASH fan you won't be sorry you bought 'em.
1,messup dvd,The first two dvds are fine however the third dvd doesnot play right. First part of the program has many squares and skips. The rest of the episodes play alright.
3,Slow Coming but a great show to watch,"I love MASH, and season two is hilarious. However it did take a long to to get the DVD."
4,Great show,This show brings back memories watching with my sister and is a present for her. She will be very happy to receive it.
1,Not for adults!,"I believed the hype about this product, and thought that it might have features that would be appropriate for adults. I was wrong. It is a child's toy and the modules I got for it . . BRAIN AGE, Casino Games . . are geared for children. I found this Nintendo to be worthless."
5,Loved,We all enjoy using this gaming device. Also have dropped it a few times and still in great shape.
5,Of coarse cool,We bought two of these for our sons. Very easy to use. They love chatting back and forth on them. Expensive toy but pretty cool.
1,Don't ever buy used online!,Yeah it worked.. after about a week the bottem screen flickered and stoped working... never never never again will I buy used online!
1,never buy used,I got this system sent to me twice and both times it stopped working in a day. NEVER buy used.
4,This is an entertaining product,My son really likes the improved graphics with this game. I like that his gameboy games will work with this product as well.
5,NINTENDO DS LITE,"MY GRANDSON WANTS IT FOR HIS BIRTHDAY, I BOUGHT IT LIKE A GIFT AND WITH IT I MADE HIM HAPPY ."
1,Broken,"The DS they sent me was broken, and unplayable. The down button does not work, and the touchscreen is half dead. Cannot calibrate it, cannot play anything on it."
1,"Fooled by ""good condition""",Very disappointed. Was listed in very good condition. Received it with a faulty screen and after 2hrs of playing it completely died. Waste of money!
4,Enjoyed what I learned - not sure about the writing style,"This book is very informative and helpful and maybe there was no other way to write it than the way she did, but it was a little strange how each chapter starts like we're entering someone's home and being introduced to a new homeschooling mom. All the weird chit-chat, about coffee, the mess around the house, stuff like that was just a little off putting. But after a paragraph or two of being ""introduced"" to these women, it was really interesting learning about all the different styles of homeschooling. Also the appendix at the end is something I know I'll turn to again and again for future use.So if you can get past the weirdness of the writing style, I think you'll find this book a great one to own, especially if you're unsure what style of homeschooling may be your own."
5,"Makes you ask ""Why wouldn't you think about homeschooling""","I received this book in the mail today, and finished this book this evening, my daughter is only 1 years old; but I have my heart set on homeschooling, this just reinforces my desires. I love reading the different stories, styles and ways that I could make my homeschooling a success."
5,It's..............unreal!!,"I love this game! I love it to the point I once actually stopped playing it because I was depressed about the poor Nalis getting slaughtered...This game is a classic that most new first person shooters will be compared to now and in the future. The only problem I really have is that there isn't much variation in enemies, it's brutes, then Skaarj, then Terrans, then Titans, rinse and repeat. Oops! I forgot the serpent people. That's five compared to over 15 in Turok 2.That and the fact that all the weapons have an aged, worn down look to them, for example, the Flak Cannon looks all rusted, whereas in UT it's all polished and shiny. Of course, I suppose it makes sense considering it sat there for god knows how long (hypothetically of course).No matter what though, I still love the game, even after a couple years of intense play. And until Unreal 2, I'll have to settle for this even if I didn't like it."
3,A polite and easy going erotica novel,"Re-published, in 1986 by Caroll & Graf, one of the oldest and foremost printers of ewrotica, this book hit a second print n 1989 but as far as I can tell none after that .....The book deals with two main characters, Anthony Gray, an almost 50'ish English male, and Cassie, a 27 year old American girl living in Europe. Anthony,as can be expected is independently wealthy and a seller of fine art allowing him entrance to society and it's womenfolk. Cassie on the other hand is not wealthy and lives with a couple, Helen and Lucien Delavignes. Helen is a devout follower of the sapphic arts while Cassie our heroine gets her pleasures wherever she can find them ....I didn't give the book five stars since I believe that the players are pretty well all of the same age and social group, and, all appear to be so so so polite and gentle. I would have exected a lot more earthyness in my Victorian erotic arts ...."
4,Good insights into and from one of Alexander's students,"This is not really a book as much as a compendium of various jottings and writings from Mr. MacDonald. But he does provide very useful distinctions and reminders. Too bad much of the Alexander world is forgetting this stuff.This book is principally for teachers or teachers in training. If you've not had a lesson or fewer than 15 lessons, this book won't be as useful. But I think his description of Directions and Primary Control are useful even to the new student."
5,Excellent!,"The DVD is short but great. Yo -Yo Ma is a master on the cello. He shows that he can play any type of music, not only clasical."
3,The book does not fulfill its title....,"While I found the intial chapters to be confirming of my own independent thoughts and research, the last chapter was highly disappointing. The one issue that no one touches, without using quotations from the Bible, is the question of there being scientific proof of the existence of a soul. Strobel did no better. Outside of questionable tales from near-death experiences, he cites no scientific proof. And simply because someone states that the Bible is 'the word of God' doesn't make it so anymore than stating that the earth is only 7K years old makes this a reality. Readers should be 'thinkers' and 'pilgrims' and not just 'followers'..............."
1,Lawyers are NOT trained as Scientists,"I find it curious that Lee Strobel, who is a lawyer by training, asserts that he can adequately report on scientific evidence of God. Rather, this level of analysis requires graduate degrees in physical and biological sciences to fully understand the scientific method and how to interpret scientific literature.For a real book about science and the existence of God written by a Ph.D. scientist, see Victor Stenger's ""Has Science Found God?"""
1,Untruthful ( ),"all this book has done is denounce women and witches. the writer should review how her ""subjects"" really are before she strikes them down! VERY DISTATSEFUL"
2,Pitiful,"I bought this CD of Amazon thinkin that it was gonna rule but was I wrong,this is some of the worst Cd's I've ever heard.I recommend everybody NOT to buy this CD!"
4,"""You win or lose by the way you choose""","That was the emphasis on a children's program years ago and it would fit the story line of Leading Lady very well. There are two ""leading ladies"" in this book. One, in front of the crowds, the other, behind the scenes. They both have choices to make and we get to see the results without having to experience the ramifications. I appreciate the way the moral lessons are woven into the story line without being overtly obvious. Again, Lawana Blackwell kept my attention throughout the whole book with the way she inserted the historical facts as the backdrop for the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sitting back and watching people, which is what I feel like I am doing while reading her books."
4,EXCELLENT LOW BUDGET MOVIE,"This movie was very enjoyable from the very outset. It features some nice action, drama, betrayal and vengeance all blended together that results in an enjoyable viewing."
2,Ten City where are U,"Byron needs the rest of Ten City like Mike needed scottie, This album is beyond wack. Teb city is still my fav alltime band though, byron wake up and reunite kid."
1,Garbage,Im a huge newcleus fan and I have no use for this CD except as a coster. I feel ripped off. First off they try to make this cd sound like your at a concert by inserting cheering croud sounds over the beginning of most of the songs. Secondly they cut off Computer Age right before the synth break kicks in... WTF Best part of the song GONE song ends half way through. I felt like throwing this cd out my car window :(
2,"Libbey 62-oz Vibe Storage Jars, Set of 4","I was disappointed with these glass storage jars. The glass was too thin and the jars were overall too fragile for frequent storage use. I had planned on storing flour, sugar, etc. in them but felt I might accidently hit the jar with a scooping spoon and crack, chip, or shatter the glass. I, therefore, decided against keeping them."
3,Great look - poor seal!,"Standard shipping from Amazon was very fast (ordered in morning and received next afternoon!!) The jars look great and are the perfect size for small pastas, candies, etc. Unfortunately, the seal on them is very loose. There is no way I would store sugar, flour, or baked goods in these, which is why I bought them. Will keep them though to use more as a decoration in my new kitchen!"
3,Enter with caution,"Just what we needed: More spells and powers for wizards, who've had to struggle by with what they got in the Player's Handbook, Complete Wizard's Handbook, Tome of Magic and PO: Spells & Magic rules, the poor things. Here, in addition to a strangely lightly detailed College of Wizardry -- which makes an awful lot of changes to the game world for a ""generic"" supplement -- are too-powerful spells and proficiencies as powerful as low-level spells. This was a great idea, but DM's are better off finding a copy of either the Glantri boxed set or old D&D Gazetteer and lifting the ideas there. Some day, some one will create a great school of magic supplement. This isn't it. (Of course, since Wizards of the Coast will be doing a Harry Potter roleplaying game soon, maybe the wait won't be too terribly long at that ...)"
2,Dissapointed,I had flipped through this magazine and liked the trendy fashion. But as every issue came I found it to be heavily Anglo and white centric. The year I had subscribed the models were all white and blond most of the time. The London issue was only from a white perspective and didn't even go into the diversity in fashions from all types of people and ethnic neighborhoods that make London so awesome. Then there was the latest issue I received that had a whole article and spread on Nikey that was basically a huge advertisement ( about 6 pages of it). Not for me. Bust is funner.
4,The garlic is UNSCENTED.,"I was reading others reviews, FYI the garlic extract is unscented. Zoom in on the product and read package. But I like it for the vintage scent! It was a flash back to when I was a kid, it reminds me of all my Strawberry shortcake, and My Little Ponys. With a touch of baby powder, and plastic. Its a good smell if you remember that smell from all your plastic girly toys from the 80's. But I got this to go with my Mega Tek to stop shedding instead of the over priced garlic stuff."
3,"Some very good parts, but generally mediocre","This movie is a low-budget piece featuring, most noticeably, Cassanova Wong. His kicking prowess is truly impressive and memorable. But the plot is easily forgettable. The fight scenes throughout the film are a cut above mediocre. The final battle is engaging, but still not enough for a must-see."
3,"many cool moves, otherwise mediocre","Cassanova Wong stars in this small simple tale with forgettable plot. Fight scenes abound featuring impressive kicking by Cassanova, one the most impressive displays of kicking prowess you will see in a kung-fu film. Otherwise, film is relatively mediocre. The relevance of the ""Method Man"" is not clearly explained, and if you look closely the opening title seems to be some 90s add-on computer fonted graphic, suggesting the original title was something quite different and probably mundane."
2,$45 for a PAPERBACK - you've got to be kidding!!!!!,"So this book sounds somewhat interesting, but for $45 - I think it is a money-making scam run by this guy. Instead of buying his book, just stop to reflect upon your life, your problems, your strength and weaknesses, and save yourself the cash!!! I bet you can figure out your own life path with some introspective work, without shelling out $45."
3,solid context but cheap binding,"Despite treating this book with care, the binding began seperating from sections of the book after a few months, and now, after only five months or so, whole sections of the book are falling out. I basically agree with the concensus as far as the content goes, but what is the good of it if the book is falling apart, and so soon after I bought it. I expect a book to stay in one piece for years, not a few months. Another case of a business which cuts corners to make more money at the expense of their integrity."
4,Good novel for first-time writer,"This book starts slowly with extraneous material that does not appear to advance the plot. Don't be deceived - stick with it because it has a ""roaring finish!"""
2,Skip it,"A collection of very rough demos never meant for public release. SD get no royalties from it, and have disowned this stuff. Would you want your worst work publicly displayed?"
3,decent quick read..could have been better,"Interesting story line, but at times it was a bit verbose.I tried to stay focused, but the author did not draw her audience in with enough depth with these charecters. the ending could have been alot better. Sorry, but I started getting bored near the last few chapters and just wanted it to end so that I could move on to another book."
5,Terrific purchase,I love this chair. We own a sailboat and it is perfect for our daughter to sit in while we sail. She is safe and secure and clipped on to the companion way entrance with the wind in her hair. It's not just for eating. We use it for eating also at the dinnete table down below as well as the breakfast bar at the house. Highly recommend it!
5,Fabulous chair for everyday or travel,"I originally purchased this chair to bring along to restaurants or vacations but it was so sturdy, so small, and so convenient, I ended up ditching our high chair and using it every day at home. Our daughter liked being at the table with us and it was much easier to clean than a high chair.Now that she is older and no longer needs a high chair or booster chair we still use it frequently when friends with younger children come over to visit. I often buy this chair as a baby gift and everyone loves it. I also highly recommend this for grandparents or relatives who want to keep something on hand for younger guests. This takes up the space of a folded t-shirt in your closet!"
3,"Not one of his best albums, but good","I have almost all of Chris Spheeris albums & I do not LOVE them all.This one is not one of his best, although he has some tracks (the first 3)that are real good, the rest of the CD is slow & not my kind of music.I really bought it for the different 'face' of the album, without realizingI already had this CD with him pictured sitting down on the bed??If you have a different opinion then me...go for it! It is, still, a good album."
5,Coleman Battery Powered Lantern (Family Size),The lantern puts out a good light. I purchased it for power outages which we have quite often. So far I haven't had to use it but feel it will be much better than using candles and will put out more light.
4,Good Emergency Lighting,I purchased this family size lantern and also a smaller one for emergency purposes. They are not super sturdy but good enough since I won't be using them on a regular basis; only as emergency lighting if/when we lose power or should a disaster happen. Both lanterns with plenty of unopened batteries are in my emergency container with my other emergency items. Worth the peace of mind.
5,Bright light and long battery life,"We liked this lantern so much, we purchased one for our son and another for ourselves. The replacement bulbs need to be ordered. AT least I could not find them in a store. But the light is very bright and the battery last long. Great to keep around for hurricane season when the power goes out."
4,Different Color Temperature Bulb Needed,"I was trying to find something to use in multiple situations, including power outages. This lantern appeared to be good at first until looking at it when it is turned on. The light provided is far too powerful.13w 4pin utube, 6500 kelvin, 3.5"" tubing. This is the lighting equivalent to daylight, maybe something ok for camping but not what I want for indoors. I went out and bought a replacement 2700k utube light bulb to make it more like a lamp. The lantern is still not something I would look directly at but now it does not hurt if it gets me in the corner of the eye or a quick glance."
1,Aspartame!!!!,I am so disappointed that the company switched last July from using sucralose (splenda) as the sweetener to aspartame! Yuck!!! I loved this tea and drank it all day. NO MORE!!! I have no idea why a company would switch like that and I hope they change it back!
2,Doesn't have Splenda after all,"I had written a previous review in 2008, stating how great I thought these were. I have changed my mind. Even though it states under Important Information that it has splenda under the ingredients, Lipton quietly changed these to ASPARTAME at least two years ago. You will realize it after it arrives, as it does say aspartame on the box. It is fairly hard to find green tea stix with splenda, but I discovered AriZona Pomegranate Green Tea Iced Tea Stix Sugar Free (Splenda), and that is what I drink now."
2,Olympus DM-20,"Very satisfied with my Olympus Digital Camera equipment. And I have purchased several ( all Olympus ) over the years. My use is primarilyprofessional. Therefore didn't mind paying over $200. for a digital voice recorder. However, this DM-20 disappointed me on all levels. Enough said."
3,Not their best but worf a listen,"Good Prog Psych but not close to their best.What, this isn't Kurt Cobain? You mean somebody over thirty years ago thought of calling their band Nirvana. Impossible, Kurt Cobain invented the entire concept. Come on dum dums. Have you ever heard of allmusic guide or reading the descriptions or branching out a bit? Try not to be such a bunch of retards."
3,Um...Its Ok,"The songs on this CD wont knock you out on to the dance floor but they are silly fun. The beats and lyrics are all generic and nothing new to this genre. They are a mix of R&B and electronic beats with a very bubblegum delivery. As a singer she is nothing great, but she tries. The best song on the CD is Lose My Breath."
3,cd-weak,"i could not have been more pleased with this product,until just after 2 years the c.d. would not eject"
3,Takes me back to Crete,"I've heard this CD during our holiday in Rethymno, Crete (Greece, Europe for those who wonder where that is ;-)The waiter wrote down the name of the artist and said it would be difficult to get the CD. Indeed,it could not be obtained at the local record shops. At home I found that it could be supplied via Amazon.Whenever I play the CD it reminds me of Greece, at the same time giving me the possibility to relax and let day-to-day business be out of scope for a while. There are a lot of musicians that produce new age music, I think Chris is one of the better ones."
1,Is Dog a hero?,"This Dvd attempts to make Dog Chapman out to be a hero fighting crime but too bad he bails all these criminals out of jail before he ""captures"" them. Hey, Dog you know these street punks are career criminals so stop bailing them out and allowing them to harm society on your dime."
4,Not your usual video collection!,"Very enjoyable collection of bits and pieces of Laurie Anderson's work.A few music videos in the traditional sense, but mostly short surreal comic piecesdisplaying her wit and sense of irony, combined with a nimble use of (often distorted)imagery. Not surprising given how much she uses films and projections in her stageshows.Not the very best of her work, but I'll take her at 85% over just about anyone around. Andif you don't know this unique, creative, funny and very influential performance artistthis is a good place to start. Although why it's not out on DVD is beyond me..."
5,Couldn't be more pleased,"I did a lot of research before buying this product but decided on it because of its 5.8GHZ cordless telephone/fax capability. Once I had the machine, it intimidated me because of all the features it offered but I quickly found out that it is extremely user friendly. It offers easy to use menus and even contains help information which can easily be printed out from the fax. Receiption on the telephone is crystal clear, even when used near a PC. Faxes received are also very clear. The only negative aspect of this system is the fact that it only comes with one extender phone and additional phones are a little pricey. That said, I am very happy with my choice and would buy this system again in a heartbeat."
4,Mmmm...okay!,"Great debut, all the songs in the album were good.The only thing I didn't like is that the CD wasdefinitely too short and they should've added moretracks or at least made most of their songs at least4 min long, but overall the album was a good startfor this band. Best tracks are Attention, Seasons,Slowdown and *Classifieds*."
3,o.k,this is realy a cd that was alright it had its good and bad points but it is there first one so i guess i can cut them some slack for that. seasons is a good song the best emo you could hear. and its about time someone decidid to try some slow popy emo nice effort for that.go msu all the way!!!!
3,am i missing something?,"don't answer that, smartass.but seriously, am i the the only one who thinks that ""almost here"" fails to live up to all it's hype? I gave this record about three listens before finally being so fed up with waiting for it to grow on me. Alot of people compare them (the academy is...) to fall out boy. Alot of people get pissed off by that compairison too. Well, you're both right. In some ways, TAI IS like FOB. But in terms of aggression, emotion and instrumentals, TAI falls way, WAY short. FOB is famous now. So yeah, the ""thing"" to do is find a new ""indie"" band to love. But what happens when TAI gets picked up by, oh say, Island records? They'll become famous (they already are, sorta), and you'll hate them. You scene kids make me sick.Why not instead of judging bands based on their status or label, we base judgment on overall quality. Both bands are talented, no doubt, but there's a reason why FOB is mega famous and TAI isn't."
5,great!,"This CD is the greatest. I knew it was when I saw it. I knew it so I jsut HAD to have it. SO I begged my mom to buy it for me, seeing as I was broke. I opened it right before we got to the car and Attention came on and I was deeply enticed by William Beckett's gorgeous voice. I got Almost Here stuck in my head for weeeks. I bought the CD when it came out and I STILL have Almost Here stuck in my head. If you don't want to read all of this here's the condensed versionTHIS CD IS AWESOMMEEE!!!!!SoYeahLIkeBUYIT!!!!!!!"
4,Tobacco Colletibles book,I bought one of these for a friend in a foreign country and he passed it on to a friend and then I was asked to get four more. I expect to get more requests for it.
1,Trite,"The book is trite, boring and difficult to read. Poorly worded exercise questions make the book unbearable. The ideas are difficult to understand. Perhaps, a good editor could have saved the book. Or, any editor for that matter."
2,"Nothing New, Just Some Tricks","All the 14 tools in this book are not new to me. The book, however, provides some insights on how to apply them to problem solving. In addition, the author devotes too much space on probability and weighting assignment to decision making (6 tools:Decision/Event Tree, Weighted Ranking,Probability Tree, Utility Tree, Utitlity Matrix, Advanced Utility Analysis). You don't miss much if you don't read it."
3,"Same old, same old","Good book but essentially more of the same old, same old. Probably useful for entry level employees, which I think is it's primary value."
5,"""Witching Metaaal""",I would expect nothing less from the one of the best thrash metal bands on the planet. Anyone who is a fan of thrash metal should have this album in their collection.
2,Price matches design quality...,"I found assembly to be fast and easy. The unit is not exactly what you would call sturdy, and it is certainly not ""furniture"". It looks exactly like the photo...no surprises. The ""grass smell"" that another reviewer found unpleasant and objectionable, for me, is actually one its nicer qualities! I would call it an ""aroma"". I purchased this item to use in a country kitchen as an upgrade from open bags to hold clean trash, and glass, plastic, metal and paper recycling on their way to the basement. I'm planning to put the currently used bags inside the compartments for easy removal when full. Having noted the ""central sag"" issue of another reviewer, I will either attach some support below, or put heavier items in one of the end bins. I will probably be functional, and is not particularly unattractive. Sorry... Can't figure out how to insert product link..."
5,Hug Morton's North Carolina,"I gave this book to my Brother and Sister in law for Christmas. They are with the State Department therefore they are stationed in countries all over the world. In each country they have lived in they have a book to remember their time there. They originally hail from North Carolina, so when I saw this book I knew it was the perfect gift. I was correct! They love seeing all the places they remember, and sharing those memories with their daughter who has never been ""home"" to North Carolina. The photos are wonderful. The book is not an oversized coffee table book, but one you can store in a book shelf or on that coffee table. They can't stop thanking us for the book and the memories that it has brought to them."
4,The cd is awesome!,"I met the Bigg Grille family this weekend at the concert with Zero, they have very good music also. I must say they are very nice,down to earth and professional individuals. They gave me a demo cd when I listened to it I knew I had to have the whole Raw and Rugged. When I went to hastings to buy the cd I noticed they had 2 different cds I had to buy both and I must say I'm very pleased too! Whats even better than that I am a huge SPM fan keep representin' for east texas...""Do yo thang"" then Bigg Grille.....peace!! thanks for letting me know about amazon.com too. Im a true fan now!..."
4,[Good Album],RAW & RUGGED IS A VERY GOOD INDIE CD. BY THE LOOK OF THE GRAPHICS AND THE SOUND OF THE PRODUCTION I THOUGHT THEY WERE MAJOR LABEL AFFILLIATED. ...I LOVE THIS CD. THEY TRULY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO INTRODUCE REAL RAP FOR THE DIRTY DIRTY....4 EVER TO STREET MUSIC
1,Dislike.,"This was a waste of time. It was an interesting idea at first - A Phantom of the Opera story with a Da Vinci Code twist... But I soon realized that it wasn't worth it.The acting in particular was atrocious... I wanted to throw tomatoes at them, it was so bad.I love the Phantom of the Opera (Leroux's book and ALW's musical), but don't waste your money on this; it was painful to watch."
3,"good, but not worth 10 bucks","As a Fan of all things Phantom of the Opera, I've wanted to see this movie since I saw it on Netflix almost a year ago. Unfortunately, it was only available on DVD, so I was not able to watch it, since my family only gets he streaming service. Naturally, when I saw it on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy it.It met my original expectations almost spot-on. The acting and sound quality wasn't the best, but the story line was decent, if not original. However, when I spent the ten bucks on it, I was expecting a movie longer than 45 minutes, and the price made my expectations for the acting and the locations go a little higher. It was there that I was let down. If you want to see this movie, I'd recommend renting it - ten bucks is double what should be asked for a short film of this quality."
2,The people giving this 5 stars are liars,"Pretty Hate Machine era remixes aren't good. This has basically the same junk that you're going to find on the 10 song Head Like A Hole remix album. This is really unnecessary even if you are a collector. I've been a NIN-fanatic for about 3-4 years and at one point in time I had everything they released because I felt the need to complete the whole set of Halo's. I was a NIN-sheep, what can I say. Don't make the same mistakes I did. Don't buy this."
3,The US version is a better value,"The only thing the UK version of Head Like a Hole has going for it is the Opal mix. It's the only remix during the PHM-era that strays much from the original, and it's very good. As cool as it is, it's not worth buying this single for it, unless you absolutely have to have everything Trent releases. The US version has 4 remixes of Head Like a Hole(including the other 2 on this version of the single), an instrumental version, 2 remixes of Terrible Lie, and 3 remixes of Down In It(one of which is also found on the Down In It single). The Opal Mix is the best remix of Head Like a Hole, but there's nothing else to make this version worthwhile. It even costs more than the US version does. If you must have both versions of Head Like a Hole, get the other one first."
3,This is a costume...I need a real pimp suit for my kid,"Can anyone out there help me with locating a real pimp suit? This is clearly just a costume. The title of the product, ""Kid's Pimp Suit Costume"" gives this away. I need a real pimp suit for my kid. He's very handsome and charismatic. I believe he will grow up to be an outstanding pimp, if he isn't able to be a good one already. However, the only thing holding him back right now is that he doesn't have a suit. Somehow, pimping in his Iron Man pajamas isn't doing the trick (no pun intended)."
3,Lower quality than expected,"I bought this product because it was the only note-card stationary I would get overnight with prime.I was dismayed to find the paper was much thinner than expected and that it came in perforated sheets. The perforations and thickness of the paper make a less than impressive stationary.Pros: Good for do-it-yourself cards. Ideal for printing out multiple cards at once. Includes envelopsCons: A bit 'cheap' for important Thanks Yous, Invitations. The heavyweight in the description is false advertising. It's medium-weight at best."
5,Craft ideas,This is a great product for making your own greeting cards. The paper is very rich looking.
3,Ice bucket,"It has a nice stainless finish on the outside, white plastic inside. Ice keeps for long time (I keep it in the fridge) but I was disapointed at the size. Maybe I should have done more research on actual sizes, but I can only fill two full cups of ice out of the bucket. I'd get a bigger one if I were you."
5,Casanova's Fin de siecle,"Neil Hannon and co have done it again,consistently producing fun, quirky songs, here they are with a best of album. A Secret History proves to be a great introduction for casual or new fans, however if you are a long term and hard core fan then you will have most of this material already. Its worth noting that there are some new tracks, a revised version of the Pop singers fear of the pollen count, good but nowhere as good as the original version, and Gin Soaked boy- a classic, catchy fun song.The running order of the CD is bizarre, the first song is National Express, DCs biggest hit, then the songs are mied up instead of running in a chronological order which allows the fan to hear how they have developed. Overall a great album by an even greater band, and guaranteed to cheer you up at any time!"
5,"Great, inspiring book","I love the way Pastor Cymbala writes...no frills, to the point, convicting, encouraging. So far, I have read both ""Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire"" and ""Fresh Faith"" and come away from both of them filled with both renewed love for my Saviour and sadness over the coldness of some of the churches I have been in. What a difference it would make if more Christians would read these books (along with the Bible of course) and take the message to heart. It would result in a deeper, more loving relationship with Jesus Christ and a enduring compassion for the lost. I recommend both of these books highly. ""Fresh Power"", which I am about half finished reading, is also a powerful testimony of the workings of the Holy Spirit."
3,Not as good,"Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire was the work of a lifetime. Fresh faith isn't. It's okay, but not as good as the first book, or the ones that followed."
4,Good Product,"Battery life is good.Chuck iz good, not excellent. Strong 18 volt.....and an outstanding price.....if you don't need the commercial use ""brand"" buy this drill....there is no reason to buy lesser voltage when you can get 18 volts at this price."
5,&#128156;LOVE DANZE&#128156;,"We are remodeling our bathroom, and have all Danze in there. It's very nice, well made, makes the bathroom look very nice. I would recommend any Danze to anyone! Plus here on Amazon you can't beat the price! We bought our jacuzzi tub faucet here, due to it was over half the price Danze actual site wanted! Thanks to Amazon we were able to afford all of our Danze faucets, towel bars, towel rings, robe hooks and toilet paper holders! Amazon is great! And so is Danze brand! Thanks! &#128570;"
1,weak and boring,"This CD might be ""killer"" to someone that has been listening to black metal for about 2 weeks. Dark Funeral continue to play that type of black metal that was fresh about 5 years ago...boring today. They do nothing more than rehash riffs fromMayhem's ""De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas"" album. Dark Funeral should take note that Mayhem aren't resting on past laurels and have moved beyond that album and created original music while maintaining their identity. I don't even know why I bothered buying this. None of their other CD's have had more than one spin in my player. The corpsepaint, new drummer and Tagtgren production can't hide bad songwriting and one dimensional vocals. I also like how the vocalist considers himself an emperor. Maybe for the next album he can change his title from emperor to majesty."
2,playtex cottony gel comfort strap bra,"The straps are nice but the bra is stiff and the material rough.It does not support well,also I didn't find it true to size I'm a 38dd and had to send it back for a 40dd but its not comfortable and sticks in my breast bone.I think it would have been better to try it on at a store,only I couldn't find one."
1,"Okay, if you like a ""bullet"" bra","I ordered several of these bras because I've worn them before and have been happy with them. However, the bras that were delivered to me were the old style ""bullet"" bra that doesn't look natural on anyone. They weren't the wrong bra style . . . the fabric was just cut really weird. Also, the color of the bras were not the nice color you see in the picture, they were an ugly beige! I don't know what happened, but I will not be purchasing anymore of these."
3,Not Bad,"This bra fits true to form; a very good fit. I was dissapointed in the gel straps, even though I did not have the straps vrey tight! I was expecting soft gel comfort, but the straps actually cut into my skin leaving a red mark; the lace or material is very stiff. It did help some after being washed."
1,HDMI did not work and one of the digital inputs,One HDMI input gave me video but no sound. The other gave me nothing.That was on the TV. It was able to pick up sound on the receiver. The reason I bought it was for the Dual HDMI ports as a switcher and for the HDMI for my Toshiba HD D1. The optical input over the DBS component input kept shutting of the receiver every 10 minutes. The other optical and coaxial worked fine. This is the most quirky reciever I have ever used. I have had 2 Sony receivers and a Pioneer and they all worked flawlessly. I am using the 5.1 inputs for my D1. If I had known this I could of bought another Pioneer.
1,C-R-A-P! C-R-A-P! C-R-A-P!,"I listened to this for 48 hours with my little sister, and not one song that could even be called a song. GEEZ! THEY'RE LIKE 16 AND THINK CAN STILL GET AWAY WITH BEING CUTE! It worked some few years ago, but not no more! Money whaste even for a Kid's CD! ..."
3,Not Enough Might and Not Good Enough Magic for Me,"I bought this game thinking it was going to be cool. Probably if i bought it when it first came out it would be cool, But the graphics are old school 2D. With games out like Final Fantasy 7-9, Comand & Conquer, Fallout 1-Tactics, and other 3D games, this game just didn't strike to me. Probably in its time it was an out-brake RPG but now its just not at all strikingly impressive to me."
4,It works,The stabilizer kit was easy to install and reduced the wobble issue I had on my 2003 Ford F250 Superduty
2,You get what you pay for.,"I want to state that I really like Hella products. However, I am VERY disappointed with these lamps.I realize these are compacts, however the reflector fails to put the light where it needs to be. It more or less scatters the light all over the place almost like a flood.I think I'm going to try a set of Hella projector style next time if size is an issue for me."
5,Review of Supersets,"This is a very well constructed weight workout. You start off with a warm up and use a barbell, stability ball and a step. I found this workout targets different muscle groups in a series that rotates to different body parts. This is great if you love to use the stability ball while lifting. The cueing is awesome and so is the music. Cathe pushes you for the whole 53 minute set. You know you worked out with weights when you have finished. I found that with this series you work each muscle group from a different angle which means you get an overall great workout. Cathe's cueing is excellent as in any of her workouts."
5,Fantastic intermediate workouts from Cathe,"Having recently recovered from an auto accident and been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, I'm in a weird place where the workouts that I used to do (classic Firm and Cathe Friedrich) now fatigue me. Yet less intense workouts bore me. These workouts from Cathe Friedrich provide that perfect mid-level workout that 1) makes me feel good - and challenged and 2) I can do without becoming fatigued. I adore the use of the stability ball (my low back has never felt better), music and pacing of these. I won't break down the workouts, since that has already been done in other reviews. Suffice to say that these two workouts are ideal if you are new to working out with weights or if you're typically intimidated by Cathe Friedrich's workouts but want to ramp things up."
5,Cancer and Vitamin C,Arrive on time but have not gotten in to it yet Believe in Vit. C and have had great success with the vitamin that all of nature makes in abondounce for its living creatures-- except Man- the Ginny Pig and some Monkeys. Lew
1,The Esgue Method of Health through Motion,"I suffer from very severe sciatica and when I was told about this book I guess I misunderstood. I thought there would just be a section on this particular problem-with exercises-etc. Instead I was told I had to stand in front of a mirror(and what 65 year old woman wants to do that)??? I then had to decide if my hips are in line-shoulders-etc. I blame myself mostly because I should have read more reviews on how this book works. It is a ""method"" as the book states. I guess it works for some people but I couldn't get past the first chapter. Again-this is just my opinion and I don't wish to stop anyone from buying it if it fits their problems. It's a very popular item so I suppose it's me."
4,Saved Me From Surgury,"Excellent book..... Best kept secret. I had heard of Pete and heard 1st hand from some folks who were ""healed"" / recovered by following his regimen. I then was going to have to have shoulder surgery because of extensive pain caused by extensive computer work and bad posture. I decided to buy the book and check it out. No Surgery. Better posture. Better body. It allowed me to focus doing the right thing for my body. Much easier than traditional PT, yoga or weigh lifting. In fact, I found out that my former gym routine wasn't optimal until I got my body mechanics right by using Pete's book. Thanks Pete. I'll probably never meet you, but I am grateful for your work."
1,Junk but cute,The rod is the perfect size and is really cute but after buying our third one (they all broke within one week) I give up the kid is going to have to use a stick and line. This is a true piece of junk.
1,Junk. Impossible to rethread once it gets tangled.,I took my son out for his first day of fishing. This rod lasted about 10 minutes before it got tangled inside the spin-cast reel. I opened the reel to cut out the tangle and have spent about one hour trying to get it to work again. No luck. Avoid tears and frustration and get a real system.
4,no title,"This is a long poem, some 45 pages, and the first thing I ever read by Milton. And it was actually pretty good! No wonder Milton is considered great. I felt as if I were reading one of the great Greek tragedies upon which this was surely modeled. It recreates in blank verse the story of Samson and Delilah and how Samson brought down the pillars of the public arena and destroyed all the Philistines. I had not thought of that Biblical story in a long time. Milton makes it seem very real, makes the people seem alive. Even Delilah comes across as a sympathic character who had rational reasons for betraying Samson. What the real story was about his strength being in his hair I've love to know. I'm sure these were real people and there is some basis in fact. I enjoyed it."
5,Awesome!,"We have these lights lining our drive and sidewalk. The electric lights provide such a better look, and actual lighting, when compared to solar. We love them! They were hard to find."
3,Palm User,"The StreetFinder software tends to have a problem when you have a large SD card attached (512MB - Even without map on it!) When you select the changing map option, the StreetFinder goes into la, la land (I only waited 5 min & soft reset). But if you pop out the SD card it will function normal again.I'll try a 128MB card with 60x write speed. Probably not going to make much difference. Anyone knows a work around on this?"
1,what is the cdrom light?/,i purchased this album with full intent to harmonize while driving. My cd player in my new 04 passat is letting me know that it is only cdrom readable....can anyone help?
4,Sony Vaio and Vista,"I purchased this laptop not too long ago, and so far, it's proven to be very nice. The 3 USB ports will be sufficient for my mouse, keyboard, and external hard drive, and the computer itself is fast and reliable.As far as Vista vs XP goes: I haven't had any compatibility issues yet, though I'm certain they'll come up at some point.All told, though, the widescreen display, 2gb standard RAM, and impressive hard drive all combine to make what is, to me, a very powerful and effective system, the only downside of which is its size, which is also a plus (screen size)."
5,The most important CW book published in 1998/99,"This is the first book-length study of McClellan's critics. Its importance is magnified both by its challenge to consensus ""truths"" about McClellan and by the importance of McClellan himself to the early Union war effort. Well written, eminently reasonable, thoroughly informed of all the McClellan controversies, this is a volume for anyone who wants to delve just a little deeper than pop history. Rowland makes historiography (ugly word) easy and even enjoyable. I can't recommend this work highly enough."
4,A Defense Brief for McClellan,"Be warned. This is not a narrative of George B. McClellan's roller coaster ride in command of the Union Army. Instead, Thomas Rowland offers an interesting number of chapters taking aim at historians who have highlighted what they consider McClellan's character flaws. Rowland shows that McClellan was not delusional or mentally unstable and guides the reader through studies on McClellan and the Union war effort. Rowland compares McClellan to Sherman and Grant the entire book and it can get a bit repetitive. Rowland also reminds readers that McClellan faced the Confederate army in its prime. The book is dry and legalistic; more concerned with reviewing other works on McClellan instead of offering a portrait of ""Little Mac."" Readers will leave the book conceding that McClellan was not as incompetent and as unstable as the likes of Stephen Sears make him out to be but still agree with Grant that McClellan is one of the leading enigmas of the war."
1,garbage,This is a piece of garbage. All the film is about various scenes of lesbians having sex and ejaculate... thats all. Nothing informative. I'll never recommend this dvd never!... if i could give minus 5 starts... ill give it.
3,this cd is okay,this type of music is okay. I just dotn like the dark feel to it.. very progressive house feel to it...But Graham(Quivver) did a good job of mixing this compilation.. This is not for the faint of heart. Only certain people can enjoy this stuff
2,Useless!,"It is a fast scanner, however - its is neither accurate or is the software good. It's constantly saying ""Not Responding"" and freezing up. Also, there is no batch settings where you can tell it to save names in a cretin order. It likes to save them as ""LastnameFirstname"". Also, you cannot break out the address or name fields so it is hard to do a fast edit.It does export to many types of files and I like that a lot."
2,Scanner Great Software is Poor!,When I received the scannner I was impressed how easily it connected and machine calibrated itself. It scanned numerous business cards without issue. The software to sync with Outlook was complicated. I emailed customer service and they were not helpful. I had to return the unit.
1,Piece of Junk....do not buy,"Scans very poorly, it scans half the card, and it won't scan raised (thermo) cards at all. All a big blur. Strongly suggest against this product it just doesn't work properly."
3,In a perfect world,The unit works great if all the cards have a similar contrast. It is not very creative with artistic fonts. I like the interface. Recommend not buying it. Look at other reviews of other product as it relates to setting the unit up and calibration.
4,Great Product,"Does what it says: easy to install & scan that stack of cards. Recognition isn't perfect, but very good, and it's easy to edit."
2,Not for me,I may have been expecting too much but I was not happy with the product. It didn't recognize all of the information on any card so something had to be manually correct for each new contact. With that I might as well enter them manually. I've returned the product for a refund.
4,good product,this is a good product. it save me a lot of time event though some time I have to correct manually the scan result. my tip is always to double check the result on the screen. I recommand that product
2,Penpower World Card Business Card Scanner,Penpower WorldCardColor Color Business Card ScannerI cannot really say how well this business card scanner works as the software destroyed the graphics on my screens so that they could not be used. I am using Windows 7 and 2 x 24' screens (BenQ and Samsung). Removal of the software immediately returned the screen graphics to normal.This was repeated 3 times to confirm that the scanner software was the problem.
1,Misrepresented,"When looking for a card scanner that would work with my Macintosh computer, the ad for this scanner state that it would work with both PC and MAC computers, which caused me to purchase this item. When received, it became apparent that it did not work with MAC Computers. Very disappointing, indeed. I was able to sell this one to a friend who needed one for her PC, which relieved me of having to try returning the item.Please make sure that all copy is correct."
4,I like it. I like it a lot.,"This is a pretty handy little gadget to have around... especially when you have hundreds of cards to input into your computer. I just plowed my way through 293 business cards!It has a hard time reading fancier fonts, and some card layouts trick it as well - so you will probably have to do some sort of editing. But it's a heck of a lot easier than typing it all in from scratch! And importing the data was a breeze.It was also super easy to install (and I'm very low-tech.)"
1,Penpower scanner DOA,"I received the scanner on time. When I installed the software, I could not get the calibration to run. I reinstalled the software on the system, tried a second computer, and contacted the mfg who sent updated software. I was unsuccessful to get the unit to work and returned it."
4,Great story.,"I love all of Galenorn's books that I've read so far, and this was no exception. It has me looking around wondering what kind of karmic energy has sunk into the dust catchers I've gotten over the years from my assorted dearly departed family members :)"
5,Great sleeping bag,"This sleeping bag is great, and a great price. I looked around and these were the best price for the quality. It is hard to find bags with a cotton/flannel interior.I purchased two of these sleeping bags for a Girl Scout outing with my daughter's girl scout troop. My daughter and I were the only ones that did not need extra bedding! We stayed nice and warm in our sleeping bags, with temperature dipping into the 20's.The only problem we had was with the string/rope that ties the sleeping bag into a roll for storage. The string/rope came unraveled on one of the bags and now it is difficult to tie. I was a little disapointed by the storage bags. They are just the plastic liners that the bags come in. Very difficult to fit the bags back into them, so we had to pitch them. Also the discription of the color of the sleeping bag is off, too. The exterior color is an army green color, with a light gray plaid interior."
2,buyer beware,"I bought this bag and the first time that I used it my toes unexpectedly popped through the zipper! I'm 5'7""...the bag barely fit my height. The zipper was shoddily made and broke beyond hope of repair. However, the bag does have a 5 year guarantee, I hope that my bag will be fixed!"
5,SS Quick Disconnect,"It was Stainless, and it was steel. It worked.Thank you very much for your attention, now goget a life."
4,alector's choice,"This book is the fourth book in the Corean Chronicles, but it actually takes the reader back a few thousand years to when the Ifrits first come to Corus. So for the first few pages it is quite difficult to adjust to the different time line and to the different characters in the book but as you read on the characters draw you in to their story and their time. A great read, as is expected now from this author."
5,"Tenemos este libro, ya todo maltratado de tanto","leerse: ES PRECIOSO ! Es lo que ahora llaman trivia o efemérides y anécdotas.Cuando mi esposo se mete al baño con el libro, ya sabemos dos cosas: QUE SUS RISA SE VA A OIR HASTA EN LA COCINA, Y QUE EL BAÑO ESTARÁ CERRADO UNA HORA !Y lo grave es que mis hijos y yo nos hemos vuelto adictos al libro! Tiene unas puntadas, unas anécdotas y unas curiosidades fantásticas: Nos da cultura y diversión...De veras, ES GENIAL E INGENIOSO !"
2,Terrible Band,"I own this watch with the rubber band. I swim, water ski, and cycle much more than I dive. My point is, my watch is exposed to a lot of water and sweat. The watch is great but I have to replace the band once a year at a cost of about $40.00 a pop. The band hangs on by its edges. It always breaks off. I don't recommend this watch for that reason."
2,"Jumbled, inconsistent, windows-tilted book for beginners","I had extremely high hopes for this book. I spend at least 12 hours a day using vim. My hope was that I'd learn a couple new things that would help me use vim more efficiently, or macros, or whatever.Unfortunately, this book is really not written for an experienced vim user. It is written for somebody who is scared of vi in general and needs a book to start with. The author goes over such mundane details as ""how to get out of insert mode"" to a horrifying degree.I didn't really learn anything reading this book. Vim comes with exceptional documentation, and this book seems to be nothing more than a digestion of that documentation.I really would recommend against this book for all but the very new-to-unix user.Oh, and the occasional commentary throughout the book about how unix vim isnt ""smart enough"" to do something the windows vim does just made me sick."
3,Everything you ever wanted to know about Vim,"This book truly contains everything you ever wanted to know about the Vim editor. I have been using Vim for 5 or 6 years (I've written two books using it!). I was captivated from the first section of Steve Oualline's book.Steve has everything in his book. It is 500+ pages long! I didn't know you could write that much about this wonderful little editor. Steve does, and it is not rehashing the same thing over and over.I appreciate how Steve covers the material in different levels of detail. There are quick references, tutorials, and detailed discussions. There is something for everyone in here.I highly recommend this text if you use Vim.If you don't use Vim, go to Vim.org, download a copy, and buy this book."
1,"Disorgainzed, Haphazard explanations -- refund time","This book is poorly structured, for example, as a newbie I tried to figure out how I could insert a file into my current buffer... simple operation, yet with this book it took me 20 minutes before I literally stumbled accross the appropriate place in the book. This book is not organized well and it hurts. Further, the author doesn't explain VI concepts well at all. The reference part is just as dis-oraganized as the rest... just try to find what you are looking for. What made me write this review is that I just wasted another 10 minutes looking for how I can have two buffers open (but not two windows) Anyway, I've given up on this book ... perhaps I can get a refund? Any other suggestions?"
4,Manzanero insiste en cantar,"El maestro Manzanero es maravilloso compositor, pero el insiste en cantar. El disco esta bonito, pero seria mejor si todos los invitados cantaran las canciones del maestro Manzanero ellos solos. El mejor numero del disco, sin duda, el de Olga Tanon, esta bello con su musica gitana, el arreglo de Somos Novios esta perfecto. La interpretacion de Olga, buenisima. La cancion que me llego al alma es la de Lucero, en Sin Limites, que belleza de letra, un amor asi, es dificil de encontrar. Mi interprete favorito, Francisco Cespedes, como siempre, muy requetebueno en No se Tu, pero insisto que serian mejores las canciones si Manzanero NO CANTARA. De todas maneras, me encanta escuchar el disco, las canciones del Maestro Manzanero, son bellas, incluye todos sus exitos, canciones que por toda la vida nos enamoran a todos. Es un buen disco, comprenlo."
4,"George Carlin before he ""Did It Again""","This tape is great. I enjoyed this cassette because George is just hilarious. If you've ever lost anything in your life, you'll appreciate this skit. How many of us have actually looked in the freezer for the car keys? More than will actually admit. If you like George Carlin, you'll love this tape and you've probably already heard it. If not, you've missed out on some of his greatest stuff."
2,back-up toaster,"If you need a second toaster as a back-up or for an unusual location, this is a good deal. I've got a better toaster in my kitchen and this one is upstairs in the ""tv room"" (where I usually eat breakfast). It's so cheap, I don't get angry when it doesn't toast very well. If you decide to get it, plan on watching whatever you're toasting and turning the item(s) frequently. That is the only way to get it evenly toasted."
5,Vocal Perfection,"Having been a long time fan of Colm Wilkinson's theatrical music, this CD displays his versatile range of blues, rock, folk, and country genres amazingly well. Think a` la Van Morrison, Ray Charles, Aaron Neville in style with not just an accomplished vocal capacity but a voice that is truly an instrument. The emotion, passion, and soul integrated in every note he sings is powerful. Amongst my favorite cuts are U2's MLK/I Still Haven't Found and the original compositons written by Colm himself. The surprise about this long awaited album is that he is an unknown in the mainstream culture. Why this enormously gifted gem is not a household name and megastar is a mystery to me!"
4,My heart is so full of this album of great Loesser songs!,"An anthology of marvelous recordings of terrific songs by a man who wrote in the vernacular for every lover of American Popular Song, what could be better? A bushel and a peck of such albums!"
4,Burton Regenerated,"This is a sweet, but vibrant tour de force of the Gary Burton quartet sound with a guitar and bass line up. It features energy, enthusiasm and playfulness with strong performances overall. There is just a hint of wistfulness or nostalgia perhaps with a nod to Burton's Pat Metheny quartet days with their coverage of one of his tunes. The song selection is varied with samplings of blues, straight ahead jazz rhythmns, ballads, new songs and a ""standard"". The band is remarkably tight and the selections will grow on you."
1,Mutable Time & Geography,"This was the first Andre Norton book I had read in many years and I was very disappointed in it. I had much higher expectations.What really annoyed me about it was the highly mutable geography and timeline. The map was nothing like the geography described in text. The Bog was north, west, or south of the kingdom depending on what paragraph was being read. A teenage girl could cautiously walk through the dangerous bog in a few hours but it took a week for sea rovers to sail around the edge. The antagonist could magically scry upon the protagonist, spend several days doing other things then scry again and only a few hours would have passed in the life of the protagonist.There was no thought, logic, or consistency to matters of time, travel time, and geography; and I found that very aggravating."
5,Two masterpieces from an electronica legend,"The Buchla Electric Music Box (Don Buchla,its inventor,disliked the word ""synthesizer"") had no greater virtuoso than Morton Subotnick, whose jazz experience brought incredible rhythmic vitality to the purrs, clicks, roars and howls he coaxed from the instrument. SIDEWINDER and UNTIL SPRING were two of his finest early works, and Mode has done electronic music fans a great service by releasing them both on a single disc. Their eerie textures and startling sound events draw the listener into a musical universe wholly Subotnick's own."
4,The fun that could once be had,"Among the lighter and more overlooked sorrows of living in a post-terroristic era of conflict is all of the fun that could once be had, but no more, like - arguably - everything that takes place in this engrossing and extremely, extremely funny book, but one in particular: cleaning out one's refrigerator by mailing everything rotten (there's a way to do this with no postage, though you'll have to read this book to find out, and if you were to try it now, you'd have 10 SWAT teams on your doorstep in 36 hours or less) to everyone who might have ever annoyed you in some way.Sigh...Read this book, and I promise you'll never forget it.-David Alston"
5,"Fun...naughty, prankish, anarchistic fun","I cannot recommend this book enough. The Boyd Rice interview alone is worth the price of the book. The conversation with the pharmacist is also, truly knee-slapping funny. The Mark Pauline interview is very thoughtful & profound. He made a good point with his bank poster 'pranking'. You will not be disappointed."
1,Will not buy again.,"Nice color printout on this card stock. Very satisfied with the few cards that I managed to print out. But....my Epson R800 printer will not handle the cardstock (because of the 85 # weight?). The stock will not feed through my printer at all, for multiple printouts. Even one-by-one, the printer spits out the product. NOT truthful, to say that the card stock works well all printers. My Epson prints out gorgeous photos, and I have had zero difficulties with a variety of heavier printing papers. Will NOT buy again. Very disappointed in the product."
5,Great Phd Thesis,This book presents an interesting research on nanotechnology.Good approach and strong experimental experiments are presented.This will be a major milestone for this field of research.Highly recommended
1,Can't Use,"We can't use this because it dosen't have the support for the Nano 5. The hole is on the wrong side. If the IPod got pushed too hard, it would break off the plug. Very dissappointing."
1,Unusable,"The guides that you put around your IPod don't fit! I have a Nano 5th gen, which is supposed to fit, but the slider that goes over the IPod while it's docked has the opening on the wrong side! So disappointing. When we tried to call the company, the number on the website was disconnected."
1,Doormats aren't sexy,"Unfortunately, the story was predictable and boring. Salvatore is supposed to be some kind of knight in shining armor but he's comes across as too controlling. The last straw is when he goes behind Elisa's back and had her replaced at her job--and she just rolls over and accepts it. For me, that's when the story really died. Elisa was supposed to be this strong, independent woman, but she's not very intelligent and it shows."
4,Great for countryside travelling.,"I am using this book to plan my drive through France. It's ideal if you plan to rent a car and drive the countryside. He tells you routes to take and suggests the most scenis ones. He also gives good, brief history of the areas and makes restaurant, hotel and site-seeing information, including telephone numbers which is incredibly helpful. My only complaint...and the reason I give four instead of five stars...is that in giving driving directions he does not tell you which way to head: north, south, east, west. So in mapping out my journey ahead of time, I am finding myself frustrated trying to figure out which direction he recommends and then looking for the villages on my map."
2,Not like rainforest,"Informative and interesting. Don't like that it's beginning is based in evolution but other things interesting. Lots of reading, like an encyclopedia."
3,A Matter of Taste,"This album is definitely an auditory feast, but one that requires a certain taste. I bought this after having heard and purchasing ""Winds of Warning"" and the self-titled ""Nomad"" and loving them both. I wish I had listened to ""Songman"" before purchasing it, though. While the album is well-produced and of very high quality, and the chanting adds an interesting element, the musical evolution away from traditional didj, drums and nature sounds rather put me off. Perhaps a bit too much ""funk"" and ""groove."" So, if you're in the market for more of the traditional style, you'll probably not like this as well as Plack's other works. Definitely give the sample tracks a listen."
3,missed the AUSSIE flavor,"I guess I was a bit put off by the white-man-in-dreadlocks flavor here. I tasted pretension. Just a bit too much funk for me. The didgeridoo is a back up instrument played again by the white-guy-in-dreads. Nature sounds here and there...loons and owls and some bush birds. Are there loons in Australia? Occasional cuts with Mr. Nomad singing totally average pop stuff. Perfectly pleasant music at times, but nothing that grabbed me. But perhaps I was influenced by Didjworks - Collective Unconscious purchased at the same time. Now that was real world music!"
2,Just OK- first album is WAY better,"Very few of the songs on this album are good- only one is great IMO. If you are only going to buy one CD by Nomad, get the first one. The first is true musical genius- a fusion of traditional aboriginal music with modern instumentation and 'pop' beats. The second is an abysmal failure by comparison."
2,From spiritual to commercial,"What a deceptionNomad first album (called Nomad)is a musical feast, a masterpiece that i have recommended to many friends. It brought together musics from 3 different cultural back ground namely australian, african, and american indian.Now here we have a disco/dance/world/newage piece of crap.Where has the spirit gone?? ....fishing!!"
5,Great oracle,I think these oracle cards are better than the tarot and easier to use- I recommend them highly
1,Don't risk it.,"I bought 2 cards for 2 different computers and within a month both had died. In building 20+computers, I have NEVER had a component go bad in less than a year.On the up-side, Amazon was great to deal with on the returns.There are plenty other cards available for slightly more money. Save yourself the headache and GET ONE OF THOSE."
5,Excellent Product,"Lost my previous network card to a lightning strike. Installed this card into my Kids' computer, takes a few seconds. Started up the computer disabled my previous card and the new one was already there and working. My kids' computer is a emachine w2925 with XP 256k ram. Its not a great computer but this card made its internet functionality 50X faster. It did come with a disk for the driver, but it was not needed on my system. I will buy this product anytime I need a hard line Network Card for any of my 5 computers. Excellent Product."
5,Quality Roy!!!!,"Not many performers, sound good live, let alone redoing their own songs and make them sound good but Roy pulls it off quite well. The sound quality on this recording is first rate and the live versions of these classics are the next best thing to the orginal studio versions. You can tell Roy really enjoyed himself in this Austin City Limits concert and it shows and the warm crowd makes Roy feel at home as 2 songs are ""encores. Most live recordings the crowd drowns out the performer when he sings but not this one. This might be the best live recording I have ever heard. Quality recording for a Quality Artist!!!!!!"
2,Definitely not a reference book,"This book isn't horrible, but it meanders all over the place. It often confuses the issue by using several concepts in one example. There are too many instances where a technique is shown but then explained several chapters later. Sometimes this is necessary in language books, but this book abuses the idea.I usually judge a technical book by how well it can be used as a reference after you're finished reading it. This book is so scattered in organization that it really lacks any kind of usefulness. It promotes itself as a possible first book for programming in general, but there's no way a beginner would be able to follow the concepts in the way they're presented here.On top of that, the writing style is choppy and often rambling."
4,coleman personal lantern.,"It was smaller than I realized. It is light and portable. This little lantern gives off lots of light. I bought it because I was without lights for 9 days after 'Sandy"". I am very happy with this product."
2,No dimensions on listing,"I could find no dimensions in the listing, and as it turned out, it was much smaller than I had wanted."
4,"Quality build, good light output for smaller areas, easily transportable","We bought this for our house for power outages and will be buying another one as well as the larger family one. This is perfect for bedrooms or small rooms for power outages--much better than flashlights and candles. I hadn't originally thought of a camping lantern for this purpose, not sure why, but in the face of an anticipated storm and power outage we saw this at the store and thought it was a good idea.Turns out it was a great idea and works perfectly for this purpose. And it will be great to take camping as well--small, portable, easy to store. Bulbs can be replaced.UPDATE: i do like this lantern, however, i found one that i like even better. it has a better light and seems much more durable.GE SteelBEAM Classic Krypton Lantern (Green)"
3,"With tweaks, we've made great use of this lantern!","The only thing I can recommend is using duct tape or something to ""focus"" the light by blocking off half of the lantern. Otherwise there's light coming from all sides of the lantern and you can only see in the two feet or so around the lantern. Not great for setting up a tent in the dark!"
5,Fantastic!,"A week after receiving this item, the lights at my office went out -- I had my handy lantern there and was able to do my paperwork! Wonderful! Handy!!"
1,tent lantern,the collapsible mechanism is too weak and it doesn't seem as bright as you'd expect. Buy something else.
4,It will do the job.,It is light weight and easy to use. Not quite as bright a light as I anticipatedm but it is sufficient for power outages. Easy to carry.
4,Americana fans you have a treat in store.,"This is one of those little films that most people will probably overlook as they thumb through the various products and never know what they have missed but the performances by the various artists are a treat and a time capsule. Appearances by Townes Van Zant, Guy Clark, and a very young Steve Earle are ""candy"" for americana music fans."
4,Great Collector's Item DVD,"I purchased Heartworn Highways about 4 weeks ago and have watched it several times. I actually think the ""extras"" are better then the main part of the documentary. The best part of the DVD and what makes it a true collector's item is the scenes shot around Guy and Suzanna Clark's kitchen table on Christmas Eve with a 20 year old Steve Earle already showing how talented he is and would become. Also sitting around the table is Rodney Crowell, Steve Young, John Hiatt, Guy and a great steel guitar player who I was not familiar with. The parts with Townes are priceless also though you should get the DVD on Townes life if you are a big fan like I am."
3,Ozark living,"This is an interesting book to me because I lived in the same area where the author lived and my father taught school in the same area where she taught. I am not sure, however, if it would be interesting to people who are not from the area."
3,Not as bad as I anticipated,"To keep their seven-year relationship alive, Jeff and Lloyd have opened themselves up to seeing other people. Their love for each other has always sustained them, until Lloyd announces he feels no passion for Jeff anymore. The previous summer, Jeff all but fell in love with a young man named Eduardo, and he still laments losing him. Jeff's best friend Javitz is dying of AIDS, and wants to return to Provincetown for his last days. Alternating from 1995 to the previous summer and back again, ""The Men from the Boys"" charts the love lives of these men as they navigate their own definitions of love and family and friends. William Mann includes some sensible commentary about an aspect of gay men's culture, and creates a breezy story around these thoughts. I found myself not liking the main character, Jeff, because he was so obnoxious and narcissistic though, but I was curious enough about where Mann was going with the story to finish the novel."
2,Disappointing,"My 4-year-old bought this with a Christmas gift certificate. It looked like fun on the box and sounded like it came with a lot of accessories. It turns out all the ""machine"" does is tape Hello Kitty pictures onto label tape. While my girls had lots of fun making the stickers, all of the supplies were gone within a few hours. Also, the labels seemed to be of poor quality. Half of the time, when the girls peeled the backing off, the sticky part came off as well and we had to tape the stickers on with masking tape. There was no information on ordering additional supplies, but I doubt I would want to buy more tape anyway. This is one of the more disappointing toys I've ever seen."
1,BROKEN UNIT,"I BOUGHT ONE FROM WALMART. STOPPED WORKING AT 12-15 MONTHS. FIRST THE DVD PLAYER PLAYER STOPPED PLAYING DISCS AT MONTH 12, AND BY 15 MONTHS THE VCR STOPPED WORKING ALSO. IT STILL POWERS UP AND TUNES CHANNELS ON VCR. IT IS JUNK. I WOULD GIVE IT LESS THAN 1 STAR IF I COULD. DONT BUY"
5,Essential for any horse owner,"It routinely delivers an outstanding product review, akin to Consumer Reports for equestrian products, both horse and rider. Tack wise, it is English, but even a trail rider like me learns something in every addition. I may not need to know the best English riding reins, but a product review on horse blankets or supplements is universal."
5,tools,absolutely love it was exactly what i needed for the jobs that i have to do. would buy it again if i ever need to
5,DeWalt Impact Wrench,"This is the second DeWalt 1/2-inch impact wrench I've purchased from Amazon. The first one was for my husband, and he loves it. It's made well, of course, DeWalt, and performs even better. He says it's much easier than the air guns in most circumstances, and handier. He liked it so much, that I purchased a second one for my son-in-law as a Christmas gift, and I'm sure he'll love his too. Thank you Amazon."
5,An amazing eye opener!,"While reading this, I couldn't help but nod my head in agreement and understanding at many of the complaints that the women in this book experienced.It's funny, it's written in an easy to read format...what more could you ask for?Do not allow the two reviews that are identical change your mind about this book. You won't regret it, especially if you get it for a penny!"
4,card games,these are good card games and the vintage design is great; they are the old classics I remember from childhood.
5,2 yr old loves this puzzle set,"My two year old is a big fan of all modes of transportation - planes, trains, cars, rescue vehicles and trucks. This puzzle has them all! He loves it."
3,Older kids may be bored,"My 34 month old daughter was not too interested in these as puzzles. I bought it specifically as a toy for a long plane trip. It kept her interest for about two minutes. She did enjoy taking out all the vehicles and lining them up...after we reached our destination.That said, it's a really nice toy for under $10 and I think younger kids might enjoy the ""puzzle"" aspect."
3,Nice Quality Mediocre Results,"Nice and portable unit. Lack of division between starting and charging analysis. Doesn't always seem accurate, the guess work isn't eliminated. Couple of battery comebacks already. Made in UK"
2,Homeschool enrichment teacher,"I used this with three sixth graders and a fifth grader. Not great results. Too complicated for the kids to stick with. I had fun putting mine together, though.:)"
3,The Great Mystery,"Josh went to visit his Aunt in Carbon City, Washington. He's going over for the summer. She told Josh about a tree house in the backyard and he went in it. That's were he met Willie the ghost. Josh makes a deal with Willie to dig up his leg bones and rebury them with the rest of his body. While he was digging he found a box of money. Josh wants to return the money without getting hurt.I thought the book was pretty good I would give it three stars. I liked the book when Mr. Turlep showed up and found out Josh found the box. What I didn't really like about the book was Willie wasn't in it much and it was called the Ghost's Grave."
5,After buying this book i have become expert in construction.,After reading this book i have reached the the conclusionthat it is the construction book which i have ever seen .Sorry ido not have much time now but i would give you a bettercommentary next time
3,Get psychotic reaction,"Indeed while this book is essential reading for any rock fanatic it is somehow less interesting than the first tome (Psychotic reactions...). While he was able to write some really brilliant pieces (The Miles one) some of the other articles sometimes border on juvenilia (the one on Black Sabbath) and while they all have some good moments overall it does the book a great disservice since it does not provide a coherent vision of his writing like the other book did. I guess that if you are really interested in rock and in rock journalism you should get it, but after the first one."
2,NOT a great collection...,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed ""Psychotic Reactions and Carbeurator Dung"", it seemed logical that a writer as smart, funny, and insightful as Lester Bangs would certainly have another book's-worth of great stuff in him, and I assumed that this collection would be it. Unfortunately, no. To be sure, there are some great pieces in here, like his lengthy recap of his trip to Jamaica to check out the reggae scene first-hand, but there are too many long-winded rants about whatever and too much stream-of-consciousness bio-junk, and I ended up skimming and skipping an awful lot of it. If you're a TOTAL Bangs junkie, well, you probably already have and love this thing...the more casual Bangs admirer is advised to beware."
2,sexcapades of a boring old hippie,"If you enjoy the idea of Lester Bangs, don't read his writing. It just proves he was never anything but another drugged-up beat scumbag. And not in an amusing way."
3,The author struggles to understand human nature.,"Perhaps the most annoying aspect of reading any Spider Robinson book, including this one, is witnessing the author's total failure to understand what makes human beings tick, in spite of obvious effort to do so.This book contains a chapter which formerly appeared as a short story, in which a character describes how she was raped by her father as a child. Elsewhere, in another book, Robinson remarks that the rape story was told to him ""verbatim"" by the actual victim, whom he would love to hear from if she's out there somewhere. That fictionalizing her childhood trauma for the entertainment of his readers isn't the best way to get in touch doesn't seem to occur to him."
5,this is a beautiful CD carly simon at her best,This is a beautiful CD carly simon at her best she is so talented this CD tells you stories and has good messages.
5,"In essence, ""Two for the price of one.""","This CD, is yet another fine example of how much more emphasis is placed in animation than here in the USA.This is a beautifully packaged CD with a 35 page hard bound mini-book included with the disk. Even though their is only one disc in the set, the listener gets to enjoy a Team Rocket ""Radio Drama"" and 4 previously ""unreleased"" Pokemon musical scores. Definately a must for any ""Rocketshipper"" or fan of the Pokemon anime."
2,oochie boochie,"i must agree with nate on this one. staind started off so raw and real. ill admit i loved and still love dysfunction. there was more creativity flowing because they werent worried about throwing another chorus in at the end of the song. its not their fault, it really is difficult to write good music and stay popular. radiohead is one of the few off the top of my head that will continue to try new things. aaron has a good voice, but it is wasted on 2 octave scales and 4 chord melodies with the standard 2 chord bridge. i love em, but the get old very quickly. oh and another thing, it bugs me when people dont tune their instruments"
3,"Good music, bad monologue and waste of TV screen","I do not, of course, expect anyone to be moving around on an acoustic set, but Lewis could at least do more than just huddle over in his chair while singing. And why bother with any monologue when every time it's just him saying ""This song is _______""?On the upside, it has a more tolerable version of ""Outside"" without that prize Fred Durst making his stupid comments. Having the music videos is a nice touch as well."
1,I liked this band better when they were Alice in Chains,"MTV Unplugged is back, and yes, you guessed it, it's worse now than ever. I'm not downing MTV Unplugged though, I can remember some rocking shows from when I was younger; seeing Nirvana and Alice in Chains tear it up live acoustically. Today however, MTV is less than a shadow of what it used to be back in the early nineties, and thanks to everyone's favorite AIC impersonators Staind, it's all of the sudden cool to play an acoustic guitar again. When you watch this live performance, you can feel the eerie feeling you've seen this before, and this is proven as we hear Aaron Lewis try to croon like Layne Staley. These songs on here are supposedly about loss, remorse, and regret, but none of it seems to ring true, and the live performance itself doesn't seem all that inspired. Pick up the Alice in Chains Unplugged DVD instead of this."
3,9.1.8 Reincarnated (CD),"Totally shocked to hear an artist I never heard of before, ten years after it was released and I am still impressed. Hood rap music with universal appeal. Grimy and musically smart, with good cameos."
3,3-tier household cart,"I read all the reviews before I purchased this cart. With all the negativity, I'm surprised the manufacturer hasn't paid attention to make the corrections. But all the previous reviews were right! You have to have a bunch of twist-ties to keep the shelves in place since there are no holes to put the trays. 2 people would be better to put this together: one can hold it and the other can put the twist ties. I'm single so it took me about an hour to put this together by myself! It got frustrating but it's kinda cool. It's small and I put all my bags of dog treats on the cart along with a few canisters and it fits right next to the refrigerator. So as frustrating as it can be to put this together, for the $$, it was worth it."
3,Need 2 people...,This was very frustrating to get together.It's small so you'd think it'd just snap together but there's no holes for the shelves to pop into...it suits my purpose but wish it'd had the holes to make assembly a tad easier.
1,Pure JUNK!!!!,"This is the worst piece of junk I ever bought. I bought it today and it is going in the trash today. After over an hour of trying to assemble this piece of junk, I give up and it's going in the trash. You snap one side in and the other side comes out and the whole thing falls apart. Would it have been so difficult for the manufacturer to drill a couple of holes in the side piping to snap the ends of the shelves into? The makers of this piece of junk should be ashamed of themselves. A complete waste of money. I will never buy another Whitmor product again. I work too hard for my money to throw it away. The only reason this even got one star is because you can't choose zero stars, but for the record, it deserves a zero."
2,not so great,i bought the fountain and it broke within two weeks. i had turned it on about four times and only left it on for about thirty min. each time. Another thing i didn't like about it was i could always hear the motor more than the water. I've seen fountains before at other peoples houses and I've never heard the sound of the motor out weigh the water so much.
3,Tasty but not in a gift box,"Just like what's already been said these do not come in the fancy gift boxes like the picture shows, just the regular yellow ones."
2,In A Word...Pathetic,"I've been a great fan of anything created and sold by Creative. So this was a real shocker. I installed the card as directed only to have it blow my power. So, I replaced the power and started all over again. This time no problems with installation. I'm using the Microsoft System 7 so I downloaded the update downloads from Creative. I'll spare you the play by play.The card uses capacitors to approach kind of a DBX system. That would be great except you get a wavy sound that drives me nuts. Do yourself a favor and avoid this card."
1,Sound Blaster Old Technology,"This product came out several years ago and does not have the technology for voice to text which is offered in Windows XP. It may be new out of the box, but it is not new technology."
4,Nice compact picnic/beach blanket,"This item is great, but not machine washable. It spot cleans pretty easily, but why make a picnic blanket that isn't machine washable? Hence 4 and not 5 stars from me.Stays dry on damp grass, and sand shakes out of it rather easily.It packs up into a nice compact package with carrying strap. That is a definite plus for us."
4,Messy,"If you are looking to use this in an enclosed area, having a way to pick them up is pretty important. I ended up not using them because I was using my garage to paint my car. Even though I covered the whole garage in plastic, these things would just get everywhere, so I just went back to using the sander.These are probably great for using in a cabinet."
5,Good movies at a great price!,"A lot of action with Speed, romance with Hope Floats and Love potion No 9. Good movies for Sandra Bullock fans. The quality of the DVDs is good as well. Thumbs up for a DVD pack well worth its money!"
4,The Disabled Kids,"This was one of the best books I have ever read.The reason I liked the book was because the chidren were disabled and unhappy; then their angel came.He was so nice that he made them believe in themselves and made them feel that being disabled doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself as normal people.But I wasn't as happy as I thought I would be because all the kids died at the end which made it more sad.They had been through a lot, and I wanted them to be as happy as their angle made them feel."
2,Not a must-read,I picked this book because it was the shortest non-fiction book on the school reading list. It was the longest 79 pages of my LIFE!
3,not worth it,"I only paid a couple dollars for this book, but the shipping was $5 something. It also took about a week to get my shipment, even though I paid for express delivery. I should've just bought it at my university bookstore."
2,Good Book,"I liked The Acorn People because it showed me how handicappedpeople have fun just like other regular people.It's a really good bookand very interesting,especially when they went swimming and to the dance.I also think the ending was sad."
3,Okay,"This series of movies is okay to watch once or twice, but not over and over again. Its gets boring after the third times."
5,Midnite Movies boxed up,"These are the 4 Midnite Movie Double Features of AIP Beach Party films that were released a few years back. I enjoy being able to sit back and watch the surf nonsense. Eric Von Zipper is king. Shame they don't run these as afternoon flicks in the summer on WLVI in Boston. Also a shame they didn't create a double feature of Pajama Party and Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine.MGM fixed How to Stuff a Wild Bikini. The original double feature release (with Beach Blanket Bingo) claimed it was a Scope transfer, but it turned out to be the pan and scan. Luckily the folks in quality control have put the Scope verion on this flipper. Enjoy the full version of Annette hiding her baby belly."
2,You don't want to be this book trust me,I have no idea why I read and finished the book.Hebe is not the kind of girl I like in a heroine and Nick is one of the worst kinds of men I have seen in a book.2 stars instand of one cause somehow I got a little emotional with the characters.
4,By the Great horn spoon is fabulous!,This book has every feeling you could receive. I really enjoyed reading it.
5,By the Great Horn Spoon!,I really enjoyed reading this book -- it is an easy read. I think that students can benefit from reading this book because they can picture themselves in the middle of the gold rush! Jack is the ideal character to use for students in the fourth grade because students can relate to him and can get excited about striking it rich! I couldn't wait to read the end of the book to see if Jack struck it rich!
4,Bullwhips mighty power,"I Like how the weak little butler Praiseworthy, beats up the mightiest bullies in town, and gets him his mighty nickname ""Bullwhip"". I read this book as a reading assignment in my 4th grade classroom at hearst elementary, San Diego, California."
4,Social comment with a twist?,"Give in to the desire that is Creaming Jesus! Like other intrigingly named bands - Half Man Half Biscuit, Joy Division and the Screaming Trees to name a few, Creaming Jesus are well worth seeking out. English Punk Rock sits very well in the 1990's. Barbed lyrics backed by a fearsome wall of sound (reminiscent of the Dead Kennedys at their best) make for uneasy listening. If you like to be challenged by your music - rather than snuggled up to (Celine Dion fans GET OUTTA HERE!) then this LP is for you. Try the other 'Jesus LP's by all means but this is the definitive one."
1,absolutly NOT what i ordered,"Very deceptive picture !! The support wraps i received have a VERY uncomfortable binding on top and bottom, NOT what is pictured in the ad !! I have bought MANY of the old style over the years and they were great, but these are awful!"
3,Not Rancid caliber,"I was really stoked for this to come out yet felt let down when I heard it. The song composition is a lot more basic than anything Rancid has ever done. Whereas Rancid's lyrics are really unique, these are quite generic. I really don't understand why this album gets so much praise. I think it's primarily a function of people trying to be conformist punks by supporting a more underground punk band and adopting a 'punker-than-thou' mentality.Campbell California is a total ripoff of Skrewdriver's Tomorrow Belongs to Me (a very weak song). Many people vehemently disagree with this, so download the original ... song and compare and see for yourself. It's obvious Lars has listened along the way.All this said, the first three songs are outstanding.Dead American and 6 Foot 5 are exceptional trax, and To Have or Have Not is a great cover.After these songs, the album is very average, and definitely not even close to being amongst the best punk rock."
1,Thornhill with Gil Evans deleted!,"The tunes are great, but I can't recommend a CD where Gil Evans' fabulous intros and codas have been edited out. ""Donna Lee,"" for example, begins with Thornhill's piano, missing an unbelievable piece of Gil's arranging work."
3,Not Their Best Stuff,"The idea of getting three people like this on your back porch for a song swap got me to buy this, but sorry...it doesnt live up to the dream. Steve Earle is just a little too over the top on his pieces, and Townes - well. Dont get me wrong, he may be the Texas Songwriter par excellence, and my two favorites songs here are Townes doing Pancho & Lefty and Tecumsah Valley. But he was struggling that night, and it shows in his voice, his delivery and his not being able to remember the words. Great idea. Mediocre performance."
4,Works for my dog,I have a long haired mix breed dog. We had a mild winter last year and the fleas were awful this year. This seemed to work I was able to get some fleas off her. We had to take her to the vet and put her on Comfrontis front line was not working but Comfrontis does not work on ticks so both is the way to go. any way the comb is nice for my long haired mix breed.
5,awesome mic,"Length:: 0:51 MinsOne of the top podcasters, Grammar Girl, iTunes tipped me off that this the mic that she uses to make such clean audio. She uses this and an Alesis mixer right into a normal PC. It convinced me to purchase it. I did a few weeks ago, and just finished an audio podcast for my site-- and, not surprisingly, my sound is as clean and pristine as hers...Highly, highly recommended if you're serious about clean, rich sound. Worth every dollar."
1,Was the author as drunk as the main character?,"Sure, the plot lines are more than a little strange, and I do not mean strange in a good way, but has no one else noticed how unbelievably CLUMSY this book is? I kept reading because one of the plot lines (the more serious one--with the bald fugitive) dragged me along. But it was doggone hard to deal with the style. Maybe I should say lack of style, unless a surfeit of exclamation points counts as ""style."" I've read Wambaugh's nonfiction in the past, and I've never found it to be particularly ineptly written. Maybe I stumbled on books he spent some time polishing, I dunno. But this book is a wreck. There isn't a graceful descriptive sentence in it, and the dialogue is almost unbearable. Even if it had been well-written, it would be pretty hard to enjoy a book where the dog is the only truly appealing character."
4,Satinelle Ice,"This epilator/shaver combo works fast, smooth and almost painless. The epilator's cooling feature is an extra, I haven't seen on any other epilator, though I don't think it is absolutely necessary. The power cord is a little too long, and it would be nice to have the option of cordless operation."
1,doesn't work,"this epilator did not work at all--it made a lot of noise but did not remove any hair, well maybe a few soft long ones--I had read good reviews of it so don't know if the one I received was defective or if this is a flawed product. the part that is supposed to massage just got in the way of the tweezers so I think that may be part of the problem. I am now using a panasonic which works as long as you remove the gadget that is supposed to hold the hairs up. My conclusion is that the extra gadgets that these companies keep adding to supposadly make them less painful don't work. I wish I could get the original Epilady that I had for 10 years that worked great--the newer one that Epilady makes did not work at all and then I had 2 Emjois in a row which worked ok but they both died after less than 2 years which is why I was looking for a different brand."
3,"Decent, Nothing Special","I purchased this set of texture squares for my 3 year-old son (diagnosed with Autism). We are generally satisfied with the product, there are a few textures our son really likes and he seems to enjoy feeling them and carrying them around the house. I wasn't thrilled with the quality; the photos on Amazon make the squares appear to be more substantial than they are in person. They appear to be thicker, like little pillows, but the actual squares are thin and flat. There are a few that would qualify as pillows (i.e. two pieces sewn together with filling) but most are not. Several of the pieces were also bent upon arrival (they are stuffed into a small bag within a box upon arrival) and we have not found a way to flatten them out yet. I was expecting greater variety of textures as well. There are 10 different textures, 2 of each."
2,"Informative, yet unorganized","While this text book does provide the basic knowledge for an introduction to psychology, it is delivered in an unorganized fashion."
4,An excellent choice,This was a gift for my Daughter's 2nd birthday and she enjoys it. I love to see her riding her own little battery operated toy that she is in control of. When she rides it her face lights up and glows. We haven't had any problems out of this little rider and continue to let others know about the great experinces we have had with it.
5,A Brilliant Dog's Life,"This unique book bursts on the literary scene with a gathering series of striking life perceptions that deserves nothing less than approbation. Pug has been called ""a worldlier Snoopy,"" but that worldliness is not based on cynicism. Rather, Pug has a gift for living and learning within a well-honed optimism. One could do worse than to follow his example. This is a fine, clear, accessible read that will stay with you a long time."
1,Too many errors,"Having worked on the launch of Armstrong's Apollo 11, I have more than a passing knowledge of the technical and historical facts about Apollo. That said, I finally gave up listing the errors I found in this book. While I think I learned new info about Armstrong, it is tainted by the many other errors. I found it to be written in several styles, often much more complex than it needed to be.Save your money for the real Armstrong book due out soon."
1,Avoid This Book/Many Factual Errors & Inaccuracies,"This is a painful book to read. The author attempts to use every word in his thesaurus, and the proofing is terrible. But what is most upsetting is the many factual errors in this book. What really makes me wonder is I know how many I caught, how many am I not aware of? I have been waiting for THE book to be written on Armstrong. I am still waiting. I should have been warned when I saw the cover with Buzz Aldrin pictured (true, that is Neil's reflection in Buzz's faceplate). Save yout time and money. This is perhaps the poorest bio on any astronaut I have ever read."
3,Decent Addition to the NASA library,"The author seems to have prided himself on his research and cites where he gets most of his information right in the text. This style disrupts the story telling, at least for me. But all in all, the book did a good job of telling the story of Neil Armstrong - the first man on the moon. I have not read any other biographies of Armstrong, but compared with biographies of other astronauts this book is fair."
5,Great Read,If anyone has any doubts about this book being worthy of purchasing I assure you that it is a great read. I agree with Bill Pogue's cover blurb that it is a page-turner. I really enjoyed reading about Neil's experiences in the Korean War.
5,Terrific Coming-Of-Age Baseball Fantasy. Excellent For Family Viewing. Performances Are Top-Notch. Score Is Rousing.,"This adorable baseball fantasy is a home run with families. Thomas Ian Nichols (before he went on to racy roles, a la the ""American Pie"" movies) is a treat to watch as [...] Henry Rowengartner, an average kid who becomes a phenom pitcher for the Chicago Cubs after a freak accident. Gary Busey (""Lethal Weapon,"" ""Under Siege"") does a fine job as the washed-up pitcher who takes Henry under his wing. Daniel Stern (who also directed) is a riot. Rated PG for some thematic elements and brief language."
4,this is hilarious,"rookie of the year is an extremely funny movie. even if you absolutely hate baseball, you'll luv this movie. It's about Henry Rowengartner - Rabbithooser,Gardenhoser,Rullenverder,Runnamucker, whatever - a twelve year old kid who breaks his arm, and can suddenly throw a 100+ mph fast ball! buy it without regrets"
4,Rookie of the Year,"Great family fun! Funny movie, satires baseball cliches. Likeable characters and good ending."
3,Good but there's better,"I received this movie since my son was addicted to watching ""The Sandlot"" This movie is more Hollywood where as ""The Sandlot"" has more heart."
3,The warm up was not very sufficient,"Just thought I'd share my two cents here, I thought the video was great but what she said was the warm up section should have been much slower. It felt like I was jumping right into the faster aerobics portion. Muscles need time to be warmed up, stretched, etc., before jumping into fast paced work. I liked Debra and her helpers, and the dance is fun and great exercise. The only problem I had was that the warm up should have *been* more of a warm up."
4,Good monitor for the price,"I compaired a number of 17"" LCD's before deciding on the Acer. My primary fear was receiving one with dead pixels. Unfortunately my monitor came with one dead pixel showing up as a red dot in the middle of the screen. Thankfully, it is a very tiny spec and hardly noticable so I won't be attempting to exchange. The picture is great at high resolution. Text is crisp, color and graphics look good. The speakers are very tiny and produce relatively poor sound, but that was expected. Getting a sale confirmation from Tiger Direct took about a week, and delivery took about two weeks."
1,Barely adequate,"I bought this book without looking at the number of pages. When I received it, I couldn't believe how thin it was. This book is 94 pages of bold print. What a joke. It is an overview at best without going into any details that would be useful to a greenpea. In my opinion, a complete waste of money. Should have been no more than three or four bucks."
2,Pointless!,This book started off being O.K but it becomes pointless at the end. Most of the most important characters pass away for no reason and the characters are too fictional for a story that takes place in a very non-fictional time. Bad and boring book!
4,Great,"Great game. This is for a thinker. It is not action-packed, but rather deliberate and intriguing. It was fun on PS2. I wish there were more Myst games in this format."
1,Ridiculous biased book,"Don't even bother reading the title, this book is ridiculous and biased. There are way way way more deaths and injuries caused by MDs every day, and to judge a profession on one account is uneducated and ridiculous. Can't believe someone would even write a book like this."
1,quite a biased book,"This book claims to present facts on the Chriopractic profession. It does present numbers, and lots of them, although most of the sources are questionable at best and the numbers presented don't generally relate to much of anything.I equate many of the statistics suggested in this book to be about equal to the statement: ""47.3% of all statistics are made up on the spot."" There are simply no quality sources listed for the numbers presented.I suggest another source (any other source) for Chriopractic education."
1,Poorly written and lacking accurate data,I am very disappointed in this book. It is really more anti-chiropractic propaganda than factual material. It is unfortunate that Dr. Barrett feels that he must set about discounting other more successful and beneficial disciplines of health care when many are of great benefit to society.
2,Very Classic Christmas,"I was very disappointed because this video advertised that it had ""Hardrock, Coco and Joe"" on it. that is why I purchased it. The Cartoon was not on this video."
1,WHAT SORT OF CHRISTMAS IS THIS????,"This sure aint no Christmas album. Except for Mary Did You Know, Up on the Housetop and I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus, the rest of the songs could easily have been included on any of her pop CDs. And the first three are totally a waste here. Reba only does well on ""Mommy Kissing Santa Claus""."
5,Excellent song selection,"This CD has a great selection of classic Christmas songs as well as a few more contemporary songs that are very respectful. Of course, Reba is always great to listen to."
1,"NO, NO, NO","This aint Christmas..its pop party time. Sure its got some Christmas standards on it (like Up on the Housetop, Mary DId You KNow and I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus) but thats about it. The rest of the songs could fit on any of Ms. McEntire's CDs because they all sound alike and don't have any holiday flavor to them at all. Try Patty Loveless' ""Mountain Christmas"" if you want a good Christmas CD!! Or stick with Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas""."
1,ORDINARY SECULAR STUFF...NOT CHRISTMAS,"The tunes may have a holiday theme but most of them are pop ballads the kind Reba does all the time. Its just ordinary. Sure we have ""Up on the HOuse Top"", ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"" and ""Did You Know"". The only good one on there was ""Mommy"" but she brings nothing new to ""Mary Did You Knew"" (Kathy Mattea's version and especially Clay Aiken's version is much, much better). The rest of the tunes are filler pop tunes that could have been included on any secular CD of hers."
1,SCARY STUFF FROM REBA; SHE'S CROSSEYED!!,She's crosseyed on the CD cover and she must also have been crosseyed when she picked out the songs for what is supposedly a Christmas CD! That's a laugh.
5,UNBELIEVABLE TALENT !!,"A Must for everyone that loves christmas!!I love every song on this CD. I listen to it all the time. It makes me feel so good inside. Reba has always had the gift to touch the listener's heart and soul. Thank you Reba for always being a true and honesy artist! Love always, Gary"
1,IF THIS IS CHRISTMAS......,Then heaven help us! A less Christmas sounding CD you won't find anywhere. This is Christmas ala Pat Benatar or Britney Spears!
1,IF THIS IS CHRISTMAS..........,"If this is a Christmas CD then there is ice water in Hades. Reba's first Christmas CD ""Merry Christmas to You"" was a good CHristmas CD. This travesty called ""Secret of GIving"" should have remained a secret and to call it a Christmas CD is ridiculous. There are NO CHRISTMAS sounds on this CD at all...its just more ugly pop from Reba. She even ruins the beautiful ""Mary Did you Know"". Skip this one folks....its really terrible!!!"
2,Not her best,I just picked up Fine Things from the thrift store and I'm sooo glad I didn't pay full price for it. Maybe if she would have ended the book on page 409 instead of like 500 something it might have been a good story but I hate how he goes through women so easily. He feel in love like 4 times in one book. Totally unrealistic. I found myself skipping a lot of pages too because it was just so boring. I was surprised to see so many people liked this book.
2,It finally broke after 5 years!!,"We had this system for 5 years with not a lot of usage on it and it finally broke. The interface between the remote control and the main unit stopped working. I have tried new batteries and none of the functions on the remote works. Out of all the Japanese brands electronics I own at home, Panasonic has the least reliability and quality. I have never had any problems with my Sony, Toshiba, Sharp and Sanyo electronics. In the last 8 years, my Panasonic VCR broke, The DVD/VCR Home Theater broke, and my 50 Discs Stereo Changer broke. All of the other Japanese Electronics in the household are still functional. My last Panasonic finally broke and I will no longer purchase another Panasonic ever again."
2,Major flaws,"Got this toaster oven several years ago and am still using it. I really liked the slide out liner feature. Haven't slide it out to wash it enough to really justify it, however. More of a problem is the uneven cooking time -- toast, for example, first round may be just right, next round may take two rounds to get it right, third round, probably burnt. Also, the plastic door handle slid off -- the glue melted from the heat. It is still usable but not great. Now that my kids are starting to do their own toast, I don't trust it enough anymore. Looking for a replacement."
5,Tis Her Fantastic Self,"Maureen O'Hara, the most beautiful Irish redhead ever to step in front of the camera, has NEVER been given proper recognition by the film industry for her universally loved movies. And what's worse, she has never been recognized for having one of the loveliest singing voices of her generation. Deborah Kerr, another wonderful actress, had to be dubbed for her leading role in ""The King and I"". Maureen O'Hara, the ""Queen of Technicolor"" desperately wanted that role...and Herself would not have had to be dubbed! Can't you see her dancing with Yul Brynner and singing ""Shall We Dance""? This album is fabulous! If you love Maureen O'Hara...you will LOVE this album!"
1,Not as shown in picture,The picture for this product is a classy looking camera case. The reality is an amorphous shaped ugly red and black cheap looking case that no one would want. Change the photo or drop the product! I sent it back fast!
1,ABSOLUTE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Unfortunately I bought this EVERIO share station BEFORE I read the reviews.Normally, I am a little more careful than this. Did I not learn MY lessononce and for all!! JVC what are you doing putting out a piece of junklike this. No WONDER the price has fallen in 1/2. I wasted at least 12blank DVDs from TWO different manufacturers. Sure it worked on the first12 DVD's I burnt. It quit working with the Memorex..so I bought Maxell.Neither are working now. So do I go buy JVC DVD's now? Not taking ANY more chances.Bought a NICE Sony External DVD Burner for 199.99. It actually displays what youare burning on a small screen on top of the burner. Can be used with ANY deviceand ANY DVD Brand. Also, it is much much easier to use than the Everio Burner.Just hit one button and presto. Not a Sony Rep by any means. But I have toburn the videos I have made from my Everio Camera on a dependable burner.JVC...stick to what you know best...Camcorders...!!"
2,Returned this item,We returned this item. It was a glorified external DVD burner. It was not worth the money.
5,Style Meets Functionality,"Design a kitchen that not only looks good, but contributes to your own personal style of cooking."
1,No great ideas. Not great kitchens.,"This book features several different chefs in their kitchens. I thought I would see some very useful ideas for our renovation, but there was NOTHING relevant. This book is nice if you just want to see a few obscure chefs in their messy kitchens. There are NO suggestions or examples of design- where to put things and why for example. Definitely nothing innovative or interesting- we've all heard about the work triangle.I highly recommend Lyn Peterson's Real Life Kitchens. I have poured over this book. Packed with information about materials for flooring, countertops, etc. How much space do you need around an island, how much space is recommended for certain items, layout, comfortable working distances between appliances, how much knee room for stool at an island, etc. etc. Also has some very beautiful kitchens that WORK and details WHY. Extremely useful in many ways."
2,cheap...,"not as shinny as the picture. It's all plastic...looks and feels cheap, but the price justifies cheapness.not a perfect fit for my CRV's break pedal, but i got it on. gas pedal fit perfect.if looks are important to you, then u need to spend little more."
4,Great Fun!,"My daughter (12) and I like to find new 'car' games. We keep a couple games in the car so when we go out to eat or end up some place where we have to wait, we have something to do. This game is the perfect size and is fun because the two of us can work on it together. It isn't too hard for the kid and just challenging enough to keep my brain occupied.It is also a good one to play for a while and then put away for a couple months. That way it seems fresh.Of course I would always like MORE puzzle cards to figure out, but for the price (and free shipping when this was written) - it is great! Cheaper than the store where we first saw it."
4,Did not come as pictured,"Overall, we enjoy this toy. However, it did not come with the yellow sack for storage. It came with a rubber band instead."
3,Too small for my shoes,It was too small to stretch my size ten boots very much. I is really made for women's high heels. I also though I would get one for each foot.
1,CRAP- broke after stretching a slipper- PLASTIC,"I initially was impressed by the two-way stretch feature & the construction seemed decent, tad leery of the plastic components. After ONE use on fabric slippers the width stretch feature just spins and will not expand. I will use it for length stretch only- no width stretching capability. I expected better from FootSmart. Again this item is flimsy CRAP! I would NOT recommend."
3,It Gets the Job Done! - But be sure to get 2 of them!,"What a dunce I am.Who would have thought that shoe stretchers are sold one at a time?I naturally assumed that I would receive 2 of these beings you would typically stretch ""A PAIR"" of shoes and not just one.Well, maybe that's just me.Anyway, after cranking up my ONE shoe stretcher, it looks like it works pretty good.My particular situation is that the shoes are too tight across the top of my feet.This stretcher really addresses the width of the inner shoe and the length.Both of these would be easily addressed with this stretcher. I had to finagle the thing to actually stretch the top of the shoe, but it did ok.So, don't make a newb mistake like me. You only get one. It is metal and plastic.I was going to purchase another, so I could stretch both shoes at the same time (silly me), and I found a set of wooden stretchers for less.Live and learn.Rock"
2,"Worked, but not for long...","Bought the product before reading the reviews-- big mistake. It did stretch out my shoe, but the shaft broke when I pulled it out after the second stretching. If I were to do it over again I would probably select a more sturdy, wooden device."
3,Not for chewers with strong jaws,"I purchased this Richell kennel because it was the size I needed for my 35 lb sheltie. It was great until she ended up snapping the plastic connectors and pretty much destroying the cage. Do not purchase this if your dog is big on chewing. I had the wire and wood one for my older dog and ended up getting a second one for my chewer. She had not ""messed with"" the metal bars. Overall I do like the Richell products."
4,Great picture!,"I've had mine for a few weeks. The picture is fantastic. The menu is nice and simple, but a little odd in how you change settings. So far I couldn't be much more satisfied."
1,"good design, awful sound quality","I got it as a gift from my friends (along with the gift receipt).I tried to run it with USB 1GB stick from Kingston. It didn't work. I exchanged it with the same one in Target. No luck again. It claims to support FAT/FAT32 partitions, but in fact, doesn't support FAT, which my USB stick was originally formatted in. I reformatted USB stick into FAT32 - it finally started playing audio files.Quality of sound is awful. Based on my feeling, it cuts frequencies around 8-10KHz. That's probably fine enough for audiobooks, but not acceptable for the music. It periodically catches noises on every channel (I tried all of them), even ""unused"" ones, which is REALLY annoying.I am going to return it back to Target. Don't buy it."
3,You get what you pay for,"When I recieved these fun ballz in the box from Amazon, nearly 90% of the balls had some sort of compressed area of the balls. The quality of the materials used to make these plastic balls is not very durable with a child who likes to jump on them. They don't hold their shape very well when used frequently but will due for the time being."
3,many balls deflated,Upon opening the package- many of the balls are a bit deflated. My 18 mo son doesn't know the difference and they can still serve the purpose intended by me ( making a mini ball pit in his pack and play) - but they are lower quality than advertised and I am disappointed.
4,Fun for Toddlers,"I bought a pack of these balls for my youngest son when he was two. We filled a plastic wading pool with them to make a little ball pit. He had lots of fun playing in them (and our older sons did too), but boy did they get scattered everywhere! It was pretty frustrating for me to keep picking them up from every room in the house. Of course, having three boys, the balls got thrown around a lot too.After a month or two, the balls started getting smashed ... either by someone stepping on them, sitting on them, or purposely squashing them. If they were only a little dented, they'd pop back out - but if they were really smashed, you were just out of luck. We threw away any smashed ones and ended up with 0 balls after about a year or so.Even so, I think the price is reasonable for the amount of fun the kids had while they lasted."
1,Big Mistake,"I read the reviews and I still purchased these balls, so it is my own fault. I figured, ""they are cheap plastic balls, how bad can they be?"" Well, after paying more for shipping that the actual balls cost, they came with at least HALF of them already dented. I knew my son and his friends would do some damage, but I thought that at least they would come in decent condition. I am going to go to the store and by some different ones there since these don't look like they are going to last too long"
2,"Low quality, not crush proof balls!","We needed 5000 balls to fill a ball pit I built with left over lumbers from a home improvement project, and before we committed to make this huge purchase, we first ordered a few different brands of balls from Amazon for comparison. There intex balls came packed in a nice storage bag were the least impressive product if compared side by side with the playhut, cms and ewonder balls. I am over 200 pounds and when I did the crush test, both the intex and playhut balls did not survive and crushed or cracked alone the seam. The only one that holds up was the crush proof cms balls. It deformed but it popped back quickly. These intex balls were mostly dented after 6 weeks of use. That might be ok if our kids were only a year old."
2,Don't buy these..,I ordered 200 hundred of these and half of them were squashed by the time I received the shipment and you can't get the shape back. If you want good quality balls spend your money on the Playhut version.
2,Ok,"I forgot how much I paid for this but I think it was around 20 dollars. Made in China, which I didn't know. Wouldn't have bought. Quality is not very good. They crush too easy. Plastic material is very thin. My daughter still has fun with them, so I'm giving it 2 stars because of that."
3,OK Addition,The balls are very soft so they work out well with the bounce pit. I'm glad they are as soft as they are! They are very easy to crush but it won't twist her ankle as easily if she lands on it.
3,needed for play hut,bought these in addition to a play hut. Found same product at local Fleet Farm for much cheaper.
2,Buy better balls,"I bought these ball to replace some I already had in my child's ball pit. At first the balls held up, than within a week 1/4 of the balls had already had dents in them. Granted I do have a dog who likes to chew them. The majority of the balls has no bites marks in them, just dents. I did see a difference in thickness between some balls than others. The thicker balls are still holding strong(which is about 30% of all the balls)"
4,Great,Even though the Ea a sports games are more real the animation and fun are a lot higher quality in the Midway games.
5,Great overall book,"I already had ""Miller's Collecting Glass"" and ""Starting to Collect Antique Glass"". I took advantage of a less than $2 ex-library book offer. All 3 books cover the history, manufacture, and styles of glass through the years. Each features different color photos and selects more objects to display from different regions and eras than the others. This book originally cost $60 and has more text. But the photos really added to what I already have. I had wondered if I would be getting a sales brochure from this auction house but it is an encyclopedia. Prices are not listed (they are outdated anyway) like they are in the other books. If you are new to glass this is an excellent book to refine your interests and then you can look for specialty books. I took a chance on buying this book sight-unseen and I'm glad I did."
1,Caveat Emptor !! Panasonic Discontinued Battery - w/o it Unit Doesn't Work !!,"I purchased the LX9 complete with cradle, external speakers and leather case - for a total of $800 in 2004. Until now I have been very pleased with it. However, the detachable built-in battery has just gone bad. Without it, you cannot play the unit at all - even with mains power ! Panasonic has helpfully discontinued making the battery. So my expensive investment is now quite useless !! All Panasonic is prepared to do is offer me a small discount to buy a new and inferior Panasonic unit with no speakers. My advice to all would-be buyers is : MAKE SURE PANASONIC PLANS TO KEEP MAKING THE BATTERY BEFORE YOU BUY ANY OF THEIR PORTABLE DVD PLAYERS !!! IF NOT - DON'T BUY !!! Sadly, Panasonic has become a company that no longer believes in customer support. I guess it got too big to care any more. So, in future I'm buying Sony !!"
5,A wonderful book!,The Little Pear stories are fabulous. My four year old daughter loves them and we read them over and over. They are perfect for this age and older.
1,Looks better than it is.,"Picture is deceiving, the puzzle is cheap plastic with some moving (not easily I must add) parts that change the maze, but I realy didn't see the ""fun"", the ""think"" or the ""Amaze""."
5,Best maze game,"Contrary to the statements of other reviewers, it is possible to finish all starting permutations of mazes. As you move through the starting permutations listed on the back of the toy, the mazes become more difficult. Keep in mind that as you move through the maze, you can shift walls, but only in one direction at a time (because you must stay on one side of the wall). If you then wind up on the other side of a wall, you can shift it back. Also, you can backtrack, but you cannot lift the stylus.Following these rules, some combinations take a while to complete the maze. I found it fun to play the maze even after I had figured all of them out."
1,Do not buy,There is no solution to any of these mazes. I had 5 people look at it and they all said the same thing. There is no way to solve the mazes.
2,not recommending,i bought this for my 5 year old because she loves mazes and puzzles.... She played wih it for 10 mins and she was not interested. I cant blame her...
5,Great camera for our purposes,"This camera exactly meets my needs. It's easy to use and holds a huge amount of data. We have been able to store multiple clips right on the camera's hard drive. Deleting a bad clip is easy. I scanned the directions but didn't have to peruse them to make the camera work. Simplicity is important for us because we have a new baby and there's no time for excess complexity. Overall, this camera is a great piece of equipment."
4,Don't be fooled. good to watch,"Unlike what most people say. this movie was actually pretty good. I was just a little sad that there wasn't that many fight scenes on wesley snipes part, but it was still a great movie. A hell of a lot better than the Contract. at least this movie wasn't confusing and it made sense."
3,Didgerido Dreaming,"Very disappointed in the two disc album. Too much chanting, not enough percussion."
3,Not the definitive account,"Rosen's book is not bad -- there are interesting facts throughout the book -- but it fails to be a ""definitive account"" for 2 reasons. One, Rosen relies almost wholly on Bill Ward. While Ward obviously was there, the book cannot be a true depiction of the band when it is based upon just one member's (admittedly) hazy recollections. Second, Rosen's annoying tendency to wax philosophically for long stretches nearly ruins the book. At times, ""Wheels of Confusion"" reads more like an essay than anything else. Only for the curious."
3,"Sabbath diehards may want more, but still worth owning","At times this work seems rather impressionistic; by this I mean it is more of a long essay on the joys of loving Sabbath and appreciating the work of the musicians (especially the original four). Bill Ward gets many quotes, which is a plus, but overall it is far from a definitive biography. Rosen's heart is in the right place, but the definitive biography remains to be written."
5,An amazing book!,"I was almost afraid to actually read this book. I had taken an on-line class where the metaphysician had used this book as a text. I had some handouts from the book, so my expectations were pretty high. I got the book and it lives up to its title. I have been using the decrees and theories written in the book and it is changing my life. I have never had such harmony......in my relationship with my teenager, too! I am grateful to have had a chance to buy this book. I will keep it forever as a reference. And the book was in perfect condition at a used price. Thank you Ms. Prophet and thank you Amazon.comLinda Huffstetler-Dearing"
3,"Morals, oh please!","The author did a wonderful job in developing the characters, however I had difficulty with the morals of the main character Mel. Mel had a rough childhood. Her fathers death, her mothers inability to deal with his infidelity, and her resentment towards her brother caused her so much pain that she just couldn't deal. I don't understand why she just didn't ask her brother for the financial help that would have prevented so much additional pain. Afterall, he did volunteer to help.The relationship between Mel and her husband should have ended long before the rape took place. They were awful towards one another. Builder wasn't a businessman and should have allowed Mel to help him. Afterall, that is supposed to be the goal of a marriage - teamwork!Interesting read."
5,Great look at family life,"The Burkes is a middle class family that's just trying to make it until rock bottom hits. Mel loses her job, and Builder's construction company is not making a profit, they have to take their daughter out of private school. To top it all off the couple is having big marriage problems along with everything else. You don't want to miss this one, I am sure everyone can relate in some aspect of the novel."
3,Could be better - the good and the bad,"This book is slim, only 80 pages and lacks the depth and detail of larger books. Those looking for photos of rooms will find themselves wishing for more. The information, while useful, isn't anything unique or special. While this book will give you some basic guidelines, you could just as easily find the same type of info online or in a larger, more comprehensive book."
5,An Active Rapunzel,"Petrosinella came before Rapunzel and is a spunkier character. Like Rapunzel, she is held captive by the witch after being taken from her mother. Petrosinella, however, uses her wits to escape her captor and live happily ever after. This story originally appeared in Giambattista Basile's Il Pentamerone almost 400 years ago. The illustrations are beautiful and reflect both today's tastes as well as the age of the story. I recommend this book for anyone looking for an old twist on a tale that is more exciting than the one we are most familiar with. END"
5,The Best Superman Game Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this superman game in gamestop in vetura and I still own it since june and I have to admit it is a really good game and the gameplay just amazed me because you get all acess to superman's powers and that was cool too.The only thing I didn't like about this game is mashing the x button because my hands got so tired and it was hard but I beat the game already and it was a great game and an outstanding game and I give it more than 5 stars and I wish amazon let me rate this game 10 stars because this game deserves it and it is my number 1 superman game ever!This game is so good that it is better than the incredibles rise of the underminer game and this game is just too cool and this is my highest recommendation!
4,An underrated film with a great screenplay.,"Whether you like hip hop or not, whether you like to watch teen drama's instead of comedy's, and even if you are not a fan of those ""non-blockbuster"" movies, you aught to see this movie. The ending should have revealed more about how the school improved after the holdup ended though. Believe it or not, this movie is pretty much a Jungian kind of film, with a great trickster (the troublemaking white guy), threshold guardian (the tough guy), the underdog (Ziggy), the animus (the smart girl), the hero (Lester), the shadow (The police officer), the mentor (the negotiator), and the shapeshifter (The Sarah Gilbert character). I believe if this film had a bigger marketing budget, then it could have been a smash hit, I mean, it sure deserved to be! By the way, remember it's philosophical message (don't worry though, it's going to be sugar coated)! Take care!"
5,I have the one with bonus tracks...,"It does not appear to be available through amazon.com, though.The disc was won on eBay and is made in Germany. After the 'To Be Free' radio edit there is an additional 7 tracks: 15. In the Beginning; 16. Let There be Light; 17. Supernova; 18. Magellan; 19. First Landing; 20. Oceania; and 21. Tubular World. These last several tracks are mixed together and make up what is one gorgeous piece of music! Mike Oldfield at his absolute best! The only complaint I have is that this bonus material causes the disc to run just over 80-minutes. Audio cd's can't handle more than 80-minutes so during the last track my cd player goes crazy and cuts the piece short. The recording company needs to see that these selections go on a separate disc so they may be listened to in their entirety. All in all this is a great cd and 'To Be Free', with his sister Sally handling the vocals, is an outstanding track. Unreservedly recommended."
1,What a lack of variety.....,"ehmm...this is a horrible second league new age.i loved Mike for TUBULAR BELLS,FIVE MILES OUT and INCANTATIONS,this one is just a boring and annoying synth-programmed-electronic music without any special ideas.Mike eats his own tail.sorry,better record TUBULAR BELLS 4"
2,Couldn't finish it,Mary moves to northern India to work as a doctor in mission hospital. When she arrives she finds that the doctor who called her there has left abruptly to tend to a sick relative. This leaves her in charge of the whole hospital and staff. With little supplies and ancient equipment Mary finds herself ready to run away at any time.This book introduces weird characters and takes strange twists but it didn't entertain me enough to keep me reading. I only made it about half way through. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,Our book club loved it!,"We read this book AND were fortunate enough to meet the author and his wife, who lived much of the story...this book is an amazing experience! There was so much to talk about. My favorite parts were the beautiful characters. I loved all of them by the book's end, even the creepy ones. They'll haunt you forever. Also loved the education on religious practices and Indian Gods...treat yourself to this book! Don't pass it by! If you've ever wanted to travel or immerse yourself in another culture, this is your chance."
4,old time entertainment,Old time entertaining short mysteries. Very relaxing when all you want to do is unwind at the end of the day.
3,average,"Pre-teen Shirley stars in this pretty good movie. Color is nice, but in this one, Shirley isn't very cute anymore, and she doesn't tap-dance or sing much. Story is okay. Good for young children.Very imaginative. Shirley stars a greedy young girl who goes off in the future, past, and into a rich home to find the Bluebird of Happiness with her little brother, cat, and dog, where she finds her dead grandparents and her future sister."
3,Useful - but keep your paper map!,"We used this for the first time on a scenic drive through the mountains of Colorado and Utah. At first, the TomTom had an alarming tendency to bark instructions to leave the main road, and follow dirt tracks that looked as though they would need a 4WD. Since it came without any instructions, it took us some time to work out that it has no knowledge about heights of mountain ranges, and was sending us over them instead of round them.Also, it was sometimes difficult to pinpoint addresses of motels on long highways. You have to have a specific street address (zip codes won't do), and not all streets showed up.All was forgiven at the end though, when it navigated us faultlessly to the airport car rental desk at Denver, showing us a back way that ignored all the signs and got us there in good time. The information about which lane to take was very useful, and obviously couldn't be found on a paper map."
2,Tomtom Map Of USA & Canada [Multiplatform Use with any Tomtom GPS],"Unfortunately I was unable to use the item as it did not work in my TomTom One XL unit. TomTom customer service was contacted and I received the advice, that they do not produce SD chips for the US ans Canada."
1,"Stylish, convenient & crappy","I bought this camera and loved the IDEA of being able to drop the images directly to my laptop. The process works great, the interface is cool... but the images stink on ice. In daylight the camera has a problem with shadow detail. Inside, the camera cannot see anything unless the room lights are bright. There is a lot of digital artifacting in all of the images too.The advertisement says ""DVD Quality Video"". Baloney, the quality is somewhere between VHS and the movies you can take with your digital still camera."
3,Patience is a decision,The book was a little different than what I expected. It gives short stories when patience should be used. I was expecting a little more insight on what you can do when you're having trouble with excercising patience. The book did have some good points and for the price I suppose it was an okay read.
2,"Still cute, but mediocre movie.","I couldn't watch this one all the way through, and we returned the rental."
3,youll have to pay attention but its a good love story,"its a bit confusing at times with all the various confessions and figuring .other than that its pretty cool.lets see if i can keep this straight.theres this kid sergio whose in love with this chick.his boss wants him to burn the store for insurance money.then it goes up.a guy cons sergio into taking the blame.but to protect him,his boss says he did it.but his wife confesses to keep him clean.come to find out it was a pyromaniac who was trying to impress a crazy chick.this unravels a really strange love story.its a semi dark comedy id say.its good as far as offbeat romances go.the chicks in this movie are pretty.the pyromaniac has a definate sense of purpose,but hes very lost.im sure ive seen these people someplace but where?"
4,title of review,"Wholesome sunny pop-rock emo. It's not particularly creative or original, but something about this music seems genuine to me, like they're just playing what sounds good to them with little regard for scenes or trends. They're writing good tunes, they know what they're doing, and they're not trying to be something they're not, so I kinda like this band. I'd definitely like it more if it wasn't so horribly overproduced though. The raw crunch of a rock guitar would really benefit this kind of music. The light, feathery, droney reverb does these songs a complete disservice. Speechless is the stand-out track, sounding like it could have been an outtake from The Juliana Theory's album Emotion Is Dead. ""You give yourself away to everyone and now there's nothing left for you"". I dare you not to sing along."
1,Bully taigate lock,First off the key tumbler doesn't match up with the cover and the lock doesn't lock the tailgate.What else do i say but a waste of money.
2,UNEVEN,"I look with suspicion at anything that Spielberg lays his hand upon. THis was no exception. SPielberg is the total master of manipulation, disguising himself as a "" Great director"" . But he's not, he only plays with the audience's emotion using cheap tricks. In "" AMISTAD "", slavery issue was almost left untouched, as if it is a normal thing. Blergh !"
4,DVD Purchase-Amistad Review,"The movie was purchased November 16, 2010. It arrived the third week of December. It was purchased as new, and it was, in clear wrapping."
2,Stunningly Photographed Propogana,"The cinematography is truly stunning, one of the finest examples in film. Both stars are for that.The film is little more than propaganda and do we really need this to tell us that slavery was bad?Spielberg attached his name to this, but inside Hollywood rumors talk about how he was too busy making Saving Private Ryan to ever appear on set. I hope that excuse this shoddy filmP.S. If you look hard, there are 8 instances where boom microphone intrude into the top of the screen."
5,The best!,"In my video collection of more than 100 titles, this film is by far my favorite. Even if I have watched it many times, it still moves me. Not many films brings tears to my eyes. This one did! (And still does.) In my opinion, Steven Spielberg's best work so far."
3,A good solid performance in it's time!,"A nicely done show with Shaun Cassidy and Parker Stevenson playing the trio of Joe and Frank Hardy searching for their kidnapped father in Mexico. Former ""Dynasty"" actress Kimberly Beck does fairly good in her guest starring role(She also dated Shaun Cassidy in real life). A great show for it's second season!A true mystery."
5,Great display case,This is a great display case for your special golf ball. The wooden base is beautiful and quality. This product arrived as promised. Great experience.
5,Good Solution,This little door works well. Easy to install and provides a great way for the cat to enter/leave the house. It has a small magnet on the bottom of the door that will keep the door closed after the cat uses the door. Highly recommend this animal door for small pets.
2,Can't get it on my screen,"This door is extremely difficult to install. My husband tried to install it on his own to no avail. I tried helping by standing on one side of the screen while he stood on the other and pushing. It just would not engage. Our screen eventually ripped on the corner from so much pushing back and forth. We tried taking off the screen door like others have suggested but our screen would not come off the track. Since the screen ripped, when we have it re-screened, we'll install the pet door then.For now, it will sit on the shelf in the garage."
2,High Fructose Corn Syrup,"I know it's controversial, but high fructose corn syrup is something I have chosen to eliminate from my diet. It's a cheap substitute for sugar and some experts feel that there are unhealthy aspects connected to it's consumption.My point is, the second ingredient in the Crosse & Blackwell Mincemeat is, you guessed it, HFCS.For my Christmas pie, I went with the Borden's Nonesuch Mincemeat, containing sugar and brown sugar."
3,good hip hop,"I'm not really a snoop fan but so many years have passed since his debut album and he's still around so he must be doing something right. And every now and then there would be a song of his that I would be digging and be going to myself ""oh it's him again"" year after year LOL drop it like it's hot was the big hit here, it was so weird that you had to love it! I think snoop and pharell's collaboration worked like a charm and became a huge hip hop hit that year, probably one of snoop's well known songs in his catalogue. Beautiful was always on the radio too and had a marvin gaye like sound to it"
2,This foo a sellout,"This isnt the Snoop i liked. Back in the day this foo was tight but as of late he turned into another money obsessed rapper. I say that if you want to preserve the memory of Snoop when he was Gangsta, dont get this album. However, i gave Snoop a 2 instead of a one because he's Snoop..."
2,no no no snoop,"What to say, what to say.Not much.I thought this was going to be a tight album.Little did i know it was going to suck.There are only about 2 good songs.Those are drop it like its hot and oh no with 50 cent.i suggest you don't buy this album."
1,This cd was very terrible,"When i first heard the tracks on this cd...i felt like taking a poop and listening to that mold instead. This cd was so horrible i assumed from Snoop's song ""drop it likes hott"" refered to his own dropping the soap in jail as if it was hott, and meeting buh buh. Well, overall i suggest Snoop retires...being this cd was just plain HORRENDUS Snoop we know you aren't a gangsta beleive me I'd know. so i suggest not wasteing your 12$ on this piece of garbage...go pick up the new Lil' Wayne cd ""Tha Carter"" NO IM NOT A LIL' WAYNE SPONSOR...it's just he's so much better and actually has a flow, and good beats. It's well worth yout 12$ rather than this piece of horse manure cd of snoop. So please trust me on NOT buying this...for god's sakes if you want terrible music go buy JA RULE's new cd."
3,Why'd He Wirk Wid Dem'?,"What's up with this? Tha D O G G workin with a boyband has been? Damn, what's happend? Has he turned into Nelly or somethin? And what's up wid da homie workin' wif da Bee Gees? I mean damn I didn't even know those white boyz waz still alive. I can see wantin to get r&b into da game and mixin' em up, but if ya gonna do dat den get sum homies from the r&b game. Throw in some Jagged Edge or some RKelly, maybe some Ashanti or Jaheim. Not some boyband has been and some played out dudes from the 70's that made it big off the soundtrack to a John Travolta movie. I definately say that it's more worf it ta pick up JaRule or Ludacris or Twista's newest joints than this one. Da Dogg Fatha used ta be tru 2 da game, but wif dis album he turned his back on it and soldout doin da songs wif Lake and Bee Gees."
1,Hopefully like most other rappers........,hell also get shot soon and go far far away. BUY A FREAKIN SOILWORK OR KILLSWITCH ENGAGE ALBUM. Or even buy some old school Pantera.
2,What???!!! This is the worse album i've ever heard,"I was in the car with 2 other people when i popped this CD in for the first time. There is the stuff you've heard on the radio already, which is very solid. But the rest of this CD is GARBAGE. I would not recommend, unless your a die-hard snoop fan - in which case you'll be able to find the good in this awful production."
1,"same old, same old..............................",All I can say is that Snoop and the rest of Dre's crew keep on churning out the same old hip hop time and time again. The only hip hop worth listening to these days is The Beastie Boys and the stuff that Madlib does. Do yourselves a favour and ditch all the gangsta & bling stuff and start listening to some real music.
2,Rhythm and GANGSTA??,"Snoop Dogg used to be on top of the game when he used to be a gangsta rapper rapping about crips and bloods! Why the hell would he feature Justin Timberlake and Nelly??? Why would he name his album Rythm and Gangsta: The Masterpiece??? There is only one gangsta song in the whole album: Drop like it's hot, and thats beacuz only it is a single! Snoop gave a wrong idea of how the album is gonna be with the single. The album is nothing like that.I gave this album 2 stars instead of 1 becuz of the beats and Drop it like it's hot.Buy Snoop's older stuff instead!"
4,I was happy with the hawaiian print seat covers..,"... after the stores did not have the item I was looking for Amazon was the place to get it. The seat covers worked well with my Toyota Camry seats, but the bottom has some excess which makes it ""bunchy"" towards the sitting part of the seat in the car. Probably better for bigger vechicles."
4,Family fun but has misprints,"Bought this for a Father's Day gift - my whole family are ""0ld movie addicts"" so my two teens were able to keep up with mom and dad and my youngest actually won the game. We were able to use the board and dice from the original SceneIt movie game. Lots of fun but the trivia cards are misprinted. The answers are placed in different categories from the questions. I contacted the seller and they told me to contact the manufacturer(Screenlife) - so far no response but then I didn't expect there was anything they could do about it. Game was still lots of fun and we were easily able to figure out which answer was correct."
2,Evolution W6165 shedding comb,"This has proved not very useful. I recommend a good pair of electric trimmers, a slicker brush, and the double combed underbrush rake."
5,Quality protection.,Some of the Jeeps have white carpeted cargo areas. This tends to be trouble if you do 4-wheeling. White and mud do not go well together.This cargo area mat perfectly fits against all sidewalls of the cargo section of the Jeep. Not a bit of the white Jeep carpet is exposed.Looks like it is built well.
2,You can have any color as long as it's black...,"...and you will learn how to make Oracle-based web sites from this book, as long as you do it on WinNT and as long as you do it the one way the author explains, which is through proprietary executables. Anyone looking for CGI access via PERL or other ""open"" languages will be better served with other books. I'm sure it's fine for beginners, but if you're implementing Oracle on any other platform that NT, this book will be of no use."
4,A really good base to use a database with a Web front-end.,"I am not an Oracle database expert or a Web guru nor do I want to be. But, I do want to use some simple queries to load and update the database from my web-site. I found that this book was very informative in doing just that. It guided me in plain and simple terms on how to do just what I needed to do."
5,This Book rocks,"I have to say this bOOK rocks my world and i got cold chills when i go toward the end. i can even say that i'm proud to actually know wally jones and have know him for like 4 years and he is kick ass dude, WE ALL WANT TO KNOW WHEN DO WE GET ANOTHER BOOK"
4,Make Believe-A Definite Improvement,"Weezer rocks. Although.... the past two albums haven't been great. This album, however, shows Weezer's improvement. While 'Make Believe' is a lame title, it's muy bueno.Best Songs:Beverly HillsThis is Such a PityHold Me (sounds a bit like Donna by Richie Valens)PeaceMy Best FriendThe Other WayFreak Me OutHaunt You Every DaySongs that should've been Omitted:We're All On DrugsDamage in Your Heart (way too green albumy)Pardon Me (also green albumy)All in all it's good stuff. I recommend it."
2,"Not bad, per se....","... Unfortunately, the only thing worse than a bad album is a mediocre album, and ""Make Believe"" is horrendously middle-of-the-road. This band has the potential for greatness- just listen to Blue or, yes, Pinkerton - but somewhere along the winding path of their career, they seem to have decided that blandness is more fulfilling. And I have to give them this: if dull is what they were aiming for, they've definitely succeeded. Even the Green Album had its own particular charm (well, it was catchy, at least), but ""Believe"" lacks any sort of personality altogether. The big, bombastic riffs of the Blue era are there, but, when coupled with the modern gloss of overproduction, the effect is oddly soulless. But hey, at least it sells, right?P.S. ""Beverly Hills"" is a high point. Translation: Avoid."
1,seriously,"a 5 star review would mean that this cd is perfect......far from it.I guess it's good to people who haven't heard much other than mainstream music.There is nothing going on here that we haven't heard 10000 times before, and they aren't even making it interesting. These guys should thank MTV, because without them no one would give a crap about them right now."
1,do they care anymore???,"blah...the only reason people buy this is because it was drilled into youth culture via video, promotion, gloss, etc....since their first 2 albums it has been a long way from the top...with little rock and roll!!why do they dismiss Pinkerton??? because Rivers wussed out.bland.boring.buy their first 2 and get on with it..."
5,Dont' miss this!,"Don't miss the latest installment of the Weezer experience. Whether you are a long time Weezer fan or wondering why they want to pull apart sweaters this CD is for you. From the first drum roll to the last guitar fade the impressive guitar rifts, gotta dance drum beats, and smooth vocals are addictive. Tracks 2, 5 and 8 are classic Weezer, and should not be missed. This CD is a must have and don't stop here pick up the blue, green, pinkerton and malladroit CDs as well. Weezer is for everyone old to young, punk to pop you'll love it. Don't mistake them for every other punk/alternative/gunge band they are truly revolutionary and to us who started with the blue album we do believe."
2,"I LOVE Weezer, but...","This is my least favorite album from them. The only songs I care to listen to are ""Beverly Hills"", ""This is Such a Pity"", ""Hold Me"", ""Perfect Situation"" and ""We Are All On Drugs"" (or in other words, all of the radio singles). Everything else is just not worth listening too, IMO. I own every album and most of their CD singles and I love the first 4 albums (Maladroit is quite good, after a few listens), with my favorites being Blue and Pinkerton. Green is very pop, but still rocking.Lets hope their new album in 2008 will be better than this one. I was honestly expecting more out of them, especially with Rick Rubin producing...maybe they should have had Ric Ocasek produce it instead."
1,Make Believe its actually good,I am a fan who's nickname in high school was Weezer. I have loved every release for one reason or another. I am soon to sell Make Believe back to the record store. I don't want it next to the other albums in my collecion. Weezer is dead to me and I'll be happy to live in the past. For the reasons see this review at Pitchforkmedia.com;http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/w/weezer/make-believe.shtml
1,Terrible,"This album is absolute, undeniable trash. Hell, it probably makes the Green album look good (although I still refuse to listen to it as well). If you loved the blue album and Pinkerton and you have a lick of musical sense, you'll HATE this album."
4,a great listen,"The much anticipated Make Believe, Weezer's 5th album, has been released and is clearly not a disappointment. Many feel that they will be disappointed because it doesn't sound exactly like Blue or Pinkerton.Make Believe has a good sound on its own. Its a great listen, and has a unique sound in comparison to past albums. There's also been a clear improvement since the green album or maladroit; not only in the vocals, but theres more emotion. You can definitely feel it in 'Hold Me', 'Peace, or 'Pardon Me', and the catchiness in 'The Other Way' and 'Perfect Situtation', which still have so much depth to them. I think that this album has headed weezer in the right direction.Like most of the weezer albums, if you don't like it the first time you hear it, give it a second listen. And with time, it may just grow on you."
3,So very blah.,"As far as a weezer album goes it's decent and that's why i gave it 3 stars, but in general it's just a 2.All the songs are catchy and easy listens, but i don't feel that this album is very deep or as fun as the other weezer albums and some of the lyrics are too cheesy/cliche for my taste.I like Weezer, I really do. (and while Brian Bell is a bonus, it's not that. entirely.)all digressions aside, this album really is not brilliant or in all actuality, that good."
5,Food Doctor Diet by Marber,"This is an excellent work on the classic problems faced by people of all ages-at some stage of life. Namely; the collectiveimpact of parasites, yeasts and sugar can be very damaging tothe gastrointestinal tract and the inflammatory processes inthe body. The author provides a menu of fruits, veggies andherbs to help deflect many of the most painful problemsof the gastrointestinal tract. The book is well worth the priceof admission. It should be in every health library."
5,Useful Desk Reference,"Very broad reference text for engineering and general science; for the price, it's much larger than I had expected, and contains valuable material I have not seen anywhere else"
5,A triumph on the 2600,"Ms. Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 is awesome, and is far, far better than the sub-par port of Pac-man from earlier in the 80s. The graphics, from the ghosts to the bouncing fruits to Ms. Pac-Man herself, are some of the best on the 2600, and are as closely modeled after the arcade original as is possible for the system. The sound is sharp and suits the in-game action well, and they even managed to program the Ms. Pac-Man musical theme at the beginning of the game, a very nice touch. As for the controls and gameplay, Ms. Pac-Man is responsive and moves well, making this one of the most enjoyable Atari titles. If you love Ms. Pac-Man and old school games, then you should definitely get this version."
1,"Wow, can't believe anyone would pay for this","I got this dvd to see about visiting the Azores as an adult. I lived there as a child in the 80's and this video looks like it was shot before then. Do not waste your money, you could find better more up to date images and videos for free online."
3,Not too bad for $5,"I wanted a movie about the Nativity that covered the main parts of the story in a way that my 4-year-old would get and pay attention to. Yes, this is corny, with colors that are slightly off, amateurish animation, and some very brief, annoying songs. I fast-forwarded through the 4-minute intro and wished I could fast-forward/skip the 4 minutes of previews. We rented it from our video-by-mail service first and, for $5, it fits what I wanted it for. Totally appropriate for the youngest children. It covers the vision of Zacharia, Annunciation, Visitation to Elizabeth, Joseph's dream, census, Herod, trip to Bethlehem, shepherds, star, wise men, and Presentation in the temple. My son asked some great questions and we'll be watching it again in the hopes he picks up more of the story."
5,Great!,"Great book, every tennis fan should read it!It's a real manual giving a lot of information about all the phisics behiond tennis."
5,Wow whoop aaa!!!,"I can't stop thinking about how I love this song. Dove la amore is amazing, and the mixes in this single are cool too. You have to get it and listen it for yourself, you will dance I tell you."
3,"The first best book, but ...","Gene Prater was one of the leaders of the ""modern"" snowshoe movement. He and his brother developed Sherpa Snowshoes, the first aluminum frame, decked snowshoe. Today the market is just full of the offspring of Sherpas. When Gene passed away in 1993, his family passed on the book to Dave Felkley, a Colorado snowshoe instructor and guide. Dave has done a really good job at retaining Gene's original material, and updating it as needed. There is an exceptional chapter on snowshoeing history, which the Praters were such a big part of. It's a bit weak on ""traditional"" (or as Gene called them, ""eastern"", calling his own design ""western"") wood and web snowshoes, but never-the less it is a book that should be on any serious snowshoer or winter camper's shelf."
3,Friends Again,"I had very mixed emotions about this CD. The show clips were decent, but I have heard a lot better out of the show. What I mean by that is that they were funny, but the TV show has had better moments. However, that is not the reason for the 3 stars. Songs like ""Question Everything"" (after hearing that I bought the CD) and ""Beats the Hell Out of Me"" were great to include and made the CD. However, Thor-el's ""Friends 'til the End (I'll Be There for You)"" was the single worst song I have ever heard. That was a complete waste of my time and disc space. I could not stand that song; it completely ruined the effect by placing it at the end. To sum it up; the CD was OK, with some excellent songs, but do not bother listening to the last one. It is worth having but only for the stand out songs included and a few of the clips."
5,WHAT A FUN AND INFORMATIVE BOOK,"Just finished this great book on Lynette's adventures thru Cuba. Informative and funny and painful at times ( cycling up a steep grade with tradewinds pushing at your face). This is a great way to learn of the real cuba, away from the tourist resorts. I can't wait to go (and to read of her next adventure on Bike Friday). Buy this book...you will love it too.Craig"
3,A Christian child,"He doesn't seem to be as interested, so I will have to watch with him to spark better interest. Work"
5,Sedaka IS Back!,"This was one of my favorite albums in the 70's and I am so glad Amazon.com carries it on CD. It also includes a few ""extra tracks"" which weren't on the original album. If you like variety, and some great UP tempo tunes sung by a fabulous singer, get Sedaka's Back & the Hungry Years. They're both fun to listen to and sound great on CD. Remember, it's getting harder to find older albums on CD...get these while they're available."
5,from LP to CD,"Back in the early 60's I owned the LP versions of these recordings. Of course, I lost them over time and so many moves. The highlight for me was the luminous performance of No.102. Fortunately, several year ago I was able to add these three CDs to my library. Aural memory is more a matter of remembered impressions than sharp details, but the CDs seem to me every bit as fine as the Vanguard LPs back in the day.Those Vanguard vinyls were a bargain back then. These CDs should be, too, and I hope they will return to the catalog.Woldike also recorded an excellent St Matthew Passion for Vanguard, though it was overshadowed by recordings on the ""major"" labels of that time."
1,Put it back in the Bottle!!!,"""Genie In a Bottle."" The song and artist were known as some of the biggest trends of 1999 behind, Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears. However look today and Britney is the only one who is still much buzzed about. Christina's song, ""Genie,"" is pop but not great. The beat is lackluster and the vocals go flat after a while. I do not recommend this."
2,I think the five stare reviews are fake.,All the five stare reviews are short and read the same. I think there fake.
1,Dissapointing,"Although a good effort to convey the horrors of war, the movie lacks an intersting plot. We see scene after scene of rescuing injured soldiers. With very little dialog the viewer does not get to know the characters well. A disappointment."
3,"Great songs, but...........","Alan Bergman wrote some beautiful songs/lyrics and this CD proves that. However, I find the CD quite boring; not enough variety between how the songs were performed. He is a fine performer, just lacking in depth sometimes. I would have rather bought a compliation of his songs as performed by other singers."
3,good for beginners... think I'll stay with revell though,"I bought one of these a few weeks ago mostly for the included motorcycle model (I'm building 1:48 autobots). While I've never built anything from Academy, the lack of surface details on the helicopter's control panel (no dials, but the cops get really nice molded details), the poorly- translated Korean to English instructions (D-13 became F-15 Even when written as D-13 in Korean), and the poor quality of the decals (the Kawasaki logo for the motorcycle was a solid line on mine) make me not want to purchase another kit from this company."
5,Crying my eyes out,"I sat down reading this book, not knowing much about the AIDS epidemic or who was affected. What I learned in Monette's book is not just about suffering and losing a ""friend"", but also the battles and stuggles that we must carry on after. His prose was very fluid and he never lacked for words or descriptions to describe his feelings and what was going on in his life. It's not just another, poor me my lover died. Instead it's a tribute not only to his life, but allows the reader to glimpe the compassion and depth of his love. It also gets down to the nitty gritty and tells things like they are. And I cried my eyes out at the end, not wanting to turn that last page..."
4,A classic love story,"More than anything, this book struck me as being a love story. Paul and Roger share a really warm, comfortable life...the kind most people hope to find with a partner. This makes the fact that Roger dies so young, of such a devestating illness, doubly tragic, because of all we know he is leaving behind. Paul Monette was a gifted writer, who showed a great deal of courage when he shared so personal a piece of his life with the world."
1,World's Worst Movie,By far the weirdest movie I have ever watched. Shut it off within ten minutes. I do no =recomment this movie at all.
2,Not exactly what we expected,"We watched the previews which seemed exciting so we rented the movie, but was not as thrilled about it at the end. It was typical/obvious what needed to happen between the parent/child relationship and we pretty much watched the whole thing just because it was a movie that we paid for (have to at least get our monies worth!) ummm, move along, nothing to see here..."
4,Possibly better than the book?!!?,"I am an avid reader, and the idea that a film version of a book could be even half as good as the book is shocking. After reading the book (which was great, and paints a richer view of the internal landscape of the narrator), I watched the movie, expecting disappointment. How do you portray such a reflective, stream-of-consciousness novel in a movie without overbearing narration?This movie does it, and also helps create the gruesome visuals without turning to cheesy or disturbing horror. It was excellently cast and acted, and I can't think of a single part that was ""off"" or could have been improved. At first, John C. Reilly seemed like a bad choice, but I was convinced after watching."
1,Boring,It had an interesting premise told from the mother's point of view but it was so boring and dull. This should have been a much better movie. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
4,(@.@),"Crikey. It was bleak and disturbing, poignant, socially important and I was riveted.I believe more people may benefit from learning about early detection of psychopathy through this film. Tilda was stellar in this role demonstrating the torturous pain and odd denial of living with a disordered personality. Somehow she was able to realistically witness and demonstrate what happens to people in proximity to it.I feel this film is timely today. A lot of people are asking why, asking questions regarding unspeakably destructive choices made by disordered people. The answer is DSM IV has no rational explanation - it just exists and we should learn about it."
3,"Weird movie, but couldn't stop watching!","It was a truly art house bizarre movie where you aren't sure if the mother is just as psycho as the son. Yet, as weird as it was, I couldn't stop watching it."
3,"Story Good, Movie OK","Interesting to see the development and upbringing of a naturally troubled kid, and what works as parents (and what doesn't work). Movie-wise, not the most entertaining."
2,Just a case where the book is tremendously better than the movie,"Love Tilda, she really can't do anything wrong acting-wise. The actor who played Kevin also definitely has potential, but the movie didn't allow him to show it - the book is incredible, incredibly hard to read and really makes you think. Painful that I finished it right before Newtown. Movie could have done a better job with such intense material."
1,"Where's the ""chilling and unforgettable climax"" ...?","Ok, yes it was chilling, no, I'll probably forget about it. Plus, unless you're a complete imbecile you can see the ending less than halfway into the film. It's been said that movies use a frequent flashback format to improve a bland script. This film certainly supports that theory. Oh and Acadamy Award nomination? Look at the cover of the film, that's the expression on Tilda Swinton's face for 113 minutes. Three words to describe this film:Simple. Boring. Nauseating."
1,This movie made my head hurt!,"I watched this movie an hour ago and i still have a headache! The whole time i was watching it, in my mind i was asking ""Whats going on?!"" It dragged on.........and on...............and on. The beginning gave away the ending and the characters seemed slow and dull.I thought the dad was dumb for buying Kevin the bow & arrows in the first place. It was obvious what was going to happen. People wonder why kids are shooting up schools and doing violent things in the world, its because of movies like this that give them the idea! This movie gives a bad message. D-"
2,"Drags, Drags, Drags, did I say it drags?","If you like scenes that take three times longer to play out than necessary, with lots of nothing, sitting, staring, haunted looks, confusing flashbacks and no explanation of anyone's behavior, this is the flick for you. It also helps if you are fascinated with red (no, not from bloodshed, just....red.)"
4,Scary and hunting,"A good read but deep. This is something no parent should or wants to be faced with. I think it is a great book club book but its not for everyone. There is no happy ending but does make you dig deep and ask yourself what would you do? When I read the book I wish I knew someone who had also read the book because there were so many things I wanted to talk about. But again this book is not for everyone because it deals with something none of us wants to be a part of. We know it happens but not to us or even in our neighborhood, it happens to other people in other places. But the truth is it can happen to us and I think that is what is so scary."
3,I don't have a solid reason not to like it... I just don't,"From an objective point of view, this movie is really pretty solid. Good acting, camera work, solid plot, pacing, all the stuff--I just didn't really like it. Sorry."
1,NOT a nutshell type book,"After reading 38 pages of fluff, the book was returned. If you are a fan of the style used in the O'Reilly Nutshell series, you will hate this book! Got the Wesley book as a replacement (have not read it yet). If you can wait, I'd recommend waiting for the more serious titles (i.e., Inside InterDev)"
1,An all-time low,"This book was so pathetic - many of the examples simply don't work. I wasted hours trying to figure out why. The MacMillan web site has some updates - and THEY ARE WRONG, TOO."
3,I miss the Legion of Doom!,"These episodes aren't bad they're just not as much fun as some of the earlier ones. The new characters don't add a whole lot which is probably why they still aren't around today aka El Dorado, Firestorm and the Wonder Twins. These new episodes totally ignore some of the other characters such as Green Lantern, Flash, Hawkman etc.My other biff is each episode is only 10 minutes long. These short episodes doesn't give much time for story development it's just ""ha ha.... I'm being evil. We will stop you and then they do.""If you like the old school superfriends stick with the ones involving the Legion of Doom. Those are a lot more fun than these are.With that being said my small children (ages 2 to 4) love these episodes every bit as much as the Legion of Doom ones and I can show them these older episodes in lieu of the newer ones which are way too violent."
5,microwave cover,excellent product..easy to put over plates so whatever is heating doesn't splash all over the inside of the microwave...would definitely recommend it...
2,Nice but ...,"We use the microwave to heat up left overs often. For years, we used wax paper to keep stuff from splattering over the inside of the microwave. Even though this process worked flawlessly for many years, I always thought a microwavable food cover was a nice idea. I ordered this one and used it twice. It does a very nice job and on that basis I should give it 5 stars. However, I no longer use it because it is just one more thing that we have to clean [the stuff splatters on the inside of the cover]. The used piece of wax paper just gets recycled."
2,plastic too flimsy for powerful microwaves,"although still useable, after only one use the cover has become deformed...it does not sit right on a dish. worth only $3.99."
5,Happy so far,"I purchased this to use with my 10inch camp oven. It came well packaged all the way to Australia. Have so far unwrapped and inspected the item, looks like it'll the do the job. Will update this review when I try out my camp oven in the winter months (Jun-Aug)"
4,"Daughter of Joy, Book 1 of Brides of Culdee Creek","I very much enjoyed this book. It was a very sweet Christian romance. It is part of a series of 3 other books and will look into getting these. It is rather heavy on the religious aspect so that may turn some off and there is no sex in this book, which I found refreshing for a change."
5,Daughter of Joy,I could hardly put this book down. It takes you back to earlier times and how the story line and faith in god can always find its way back into your heart if only you let him . The story was great. There are 3 books in this series I have read all 3 they are great.
4,Good introduction to the writing of Kathleen Morgan.,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is the first I have read by this author. It reminds the reader that God's will is always the best way to go. No matter what hardships and hurts we face, God will never stop pursuing His children. He blesses when we choose to obey Him no matter what. The characters in this story learned this through their own struggles."
5,"Fascinating, a great read","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author set the scenes well and just as I thought it predictable, threw in some 'curly ones'. Kept my interest throughout without keeping me awake at nights :) Definitely recommend."
4,Great Book!,I have always enjoyed stories about the Amish and their undying Faith. I saw several Amish families several years ago on a trip to Pennsylvania and have been an admirer of their lives ever since.This book made it all more special for me!
4,Great evening reading,"This is a well-written book that's easy to read, has great character development and a book that I look forward to reading before I go to bed each night. In a time when there is so much violence, sci-fi and needless sexual content, this book has innocence in it which is very refreshing."
5,good book - interesting and easy read,I enjoyed reading this book. It was set in an interesting time period and a fast readI look forward to the next one in the series.
2,Daughter of Joy,This book just didn't keep me interest IThis book just didn't keep me interested. It was not the kind of book that you just can't put down and want to keep reading.T u
4,A good book.,I enjoyed this book. It was a nice clean book with a good story line. The story was easy to follow.
3,Just okay,"I tried to enjoy it. I like historical romance, occasionally read Christian romance.. but this one was not an easy flowing read. Chapters ended abruptly and began abruptly, leaving me lost and needing to re-read to figure out what was happening. I feel more details needed to be flushed out, more details on the life the child and father had before she arrived. Nearly every chapter had to end with a religious(or spiritual) struggle for the main character, a little too repetitive. For a free book it was okay."
3,I liked it,If you like a book with a lot of drama in it then you need to read this book but for me it was an ok book
3,Daughter of Joy,"Good Christian romance novel.Somewhat predictable but a surprise near the end makes it interesting. I think non-Christians will have a hard time seeing the characters as real, but for those who have lived their lives surrounded by Christians we know people in real life as strong in their faith as the Christians in this novel."
4,Must read,"This book took me on a journey to places in my past that had remained hidden for so long,I forgot they wrote there.fantastic read.I'm sorry I'm finished so soon. It certainly was a page turner. I look forward to reading the other books in this series."
4,A must read,Surprisingly sweet and wonderfully written! Could not put it down!!! The inspiration that is shown through the story is phenomenal.
4,jeanr,I really admired the main caricature in this book. She stuck to her beliefs even when she could have lost her much needed position.
4,New genre for me,"I don't normally read historical Christian romances but this was a nice, feel-good book. The author developed the characters very nicely and threw in a few twists. It was a quick read that would have been good for summer reading at the beach."
4,A wonderful heartwarming story!,"Yes, it was a bit too ""Preachy"", BUT, still, I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The main character, Abigail, (Abby) could do no wrong!.The world surely needs more women like her..so, with the exception of Abby's ""preaching"" which is why I gave it a four star... I would highly recommend this book."
2,Bit over the top.,"I was put off by the religous references, especially at the start of the book. It made me uncomfortable reading on, expecting more religous references. Being non-religous, I found it a bit over the top."
4,Daughter of Joy,It made me think about my trust in the Lord. And the journey the Lord Jesus still had for me.
4,Daughter of Joy (brides of Culdee Creek Book #1),This book has a good story line with religious influences. I liked it. People of faith will enjoy reading this book.
5,Daughter of Joy,I could not put this book done. When I was reading I felt like I was part of the story and could not wait to see what happen next. I have also read the second book in this series.
4,Predictable yet enjoyable,"This is an easy and enjoyable read. The story has drama and some twists, but the outcome is predictable. Nonetheless I would recommend this for a pleasure read."
1,Wow...this was awful and depressing,"Nothing good to say about this book! From start to finish it's all a ridiculous story of the absolute worst in people and how being a Christian just means you take it. Oh, and your want and needs mean nothing and obviously as a Christian you'd never even think to stand up for yourself. Pass on reading this book. My only relief is it was a free download!"
3,"may be too ""preachy"" for some","I've been reading a lot of Christian fiction lately, and this is the preachiest one yet. That didn't stop me from reading it, though, and I found myself getting teary-eyed more than once."
4,"Not religious, loved it anyway.","I'm not a religious person in the least, and because of that this story did come off as a bit preachy for my tastes. However, the message in it was still a good one, and i thoroughly enjoyed this tale of heartbreak, love, and redemption. Definitely worth the read!"
4,Great easy read,"Very well written, holding my interest throughout the book. I like books that include adventure and love, but based on Christian values."
2,A Little Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book, but I could not. Bringing God into what is little more than an overly-long, rambling Harlequin romance-type novel seems, to me, to be somewhat sacrilegious. This is not a true Christian romance story IMHO.Sorry to be so nit-picky, but a couple of glaring factual errors jumped out while reading. First, biscuits are not made from ""batter"" that is ladled into a pan, but dough that is rolled out. Second, I do not believe flour was sold in 5-lb. packages. With almost daily baking of bread loaves, biscuits and flapjacks, along with her seasonal Christmas cookie-baking, she would more likely have needed a 50-lb. sack of flour. This could have been another typo.I did appreciate the free download, though."
3,It was alright.,The book seemed a little unbelievable when the guy's wife comes back into the picture to throw a wrench into things.
3,Mixed feelings.....,"I liked the story. It touched my heart. BUT I found that I finished it because I HAD to know how things ended up, but I definitely felt anxious while reading, like I wanted to hurry and finish. It wasn't the easiest read, because the way they spoke during that era was so different, but it was a good story. Did I like it enough to check and see if there is a sequel? I haven't checked yet. Now that I think about it, a reader who likes old movies or old westerns would probably LOVE this book. Maybe I'm just a bit more contemporary in taste. It really was a good story."
1,Not sold by amazon,"I was really disappointed, amazon has always been a reliable and trusted shop and they should be clear and fair on that aspect,the blue box was in really bad shape. I'm pretty sure this is not a brand new DVD set. really low price but at the end the cost was really high"
5,Love it!,The Office is one of my favorite shows and this is just a compliment for any Office fan. It was a great deal and I've enjoyed them time and again.
2,Not so good,"Positive - its cheapNegatives--Bad at routing-so far it has told me (1) to turn from a bridge onto a road 20 feet below me; (2) turn the wrong way onto a 1-way street; (3) make a u-turn on a 1-way street-On winding roads, it tells me to make turns when I'm actually just staying on the road"
1,"bad routing, not trustworthy","good:1)the interface looks good, fancy lookingthat's it!bad:1)DUMB software: keep tell me to ""perform illegal U-turn"" when I am on i-5 going from SF to LA. It won't re-route until midpoint on I52)Exit: most of the time it will not tell you where to exit from the highway, no street name, no exit# (it will only say ""exit in 1500 feet""). So if there's multiple exits (especially in LA!) within couple hundred feet, it will get very confused and make the user confused too! 99% of the time the user will end up getting out on the wrong exit!3)when the highway splits, it won't know which highway it's on if you chose the middle lane. or, it thinks you are on the highway when it's really on the service road.4)frequent reboot/freeze up.5)it will take non-necessary shortcut, get people lost6)won't let you choose the route. Stubborn piece of junk.my wife doesn't want to use it, my friends who had used it don't trust it. makes me look like an idiot.should never get this."
3,Beginner-level pilates video with focus on lower body,"This is a good for someone looking to focus on core muscles and lower body. Low impact/exertion workout; does require some flexibility. Good if you're looking to destress and loosen up. If you do the moves properly and focus on your core, you will work stomach and back muscles as well as lower body. Good for someone looking to improve posture and develop muscles to support the spine. Its not that much different from your typical pilates video that includes some standing excercises, just condensed into one 30 minute stretch instead of separate sections for warm-up, lower body, core, stretch, etc. Good for a quickie unwind after work, or to help you get motivated if you're feeling lazy. Just not that much different from any of my other pilates videos."
5,Most absorbable form- best brand!,"I have been using this brand for years. My hematologist recommended I supplement with this type of B12 Methylcobalamin & folic acid. Now, everytime I return for labwork my B12 levels are fine again. I recommended to coworkers and friends because this is the only brand that gives me that ""I had a good night's sleep"" energy, not jittery caffeine feeling."
1,Mistake Indeed,"As one of the tracks inplies on this poor collection of Oldfields music, The Complete Mike Oldfield, is definately a mistake to purchase. There is not enough hear to appeal to fans of Mikes rareties, the tracklisting is appauling and you are much better off with the 4cd Set Elements box set or the more recent xxv The Essential Mike Oldfield collections. The year of this albums release 1985 means that, Islands, Earth Moving, The brilliant Amarok, Heavens Open, Tubular Bells 2, Songs of Distant Earth, Voyager, Tubular Bells 3, and Guitars, do not get a look in. The smart money is with Elements Box set or XXV The Essential Mike Oldfield. Give this one a miss."
3,Quite good,"When you read the book you get general idea of the history of the USA. It's not too detailed (for example, there is very little knowledge of certain presidents and events)but it covers all the important issues well. There is some amount of statistics but I believe they just emphesize the facts presented.Only minus comes from the ""aftermath"" of 9/11. It seemed to convict the Clinton administration for causing the September attack and left other factors, such as, Bush senior and his administration (and the Gulf war) with little thought.I didn't also like the particular sentence of how CIA should have involved more deeply in the observation of other countries:""Sometimes, nations need to play dirty tricks.""But I guess it can be difficult to be objective when you live in the USA and have experienced a catastrophy such as 9/11. Still, as an European myself, I was quite dissapointed with the end. The end bothers me a bit but at least it gives me an alternative perspective to think about."
3,Ace starfighter squadron lead by Wedge,"I understand that this series was capitalizing on the popularity of a computer game, but it would have been better if it didn't have the title of ""X-Wing.""That minor beef aside, the first 4 books of this series form a tetralogy. For post-Return of the Jedi novels that are not about Luke, Han and Leia, these books are not bad.As for the best novels from the era of the movie saga, I highly recommend the following 5-star novels:Cloak of Deception (Star Wars)Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul)Labyrinth of Evil (Star Wars, Episode III Prequel Novel)Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars)Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)"
5,A high action sci-fi,This book continues the Star Wars tradition of drama on action. I enjoyed it's perspective on the life of a pilot after R.O.T.J. It really puts you in the cockpit of a T-65 X-Wing fighter.
3,GOOD BUT NO HEIR TO THE EMPIRE....,"I enjoyed Michael Stackpole Rogue series to the point of infatuation! But his killing of characters and bringing them back was tiresome. Although Rogoue Squadron is an elite group of warriors, having them pitched against an entire Empire was a bit far fetched. But all in all some good bedtime reading for any Star Wars fan out there."
3,It is one of the best books I've read,"Rogue Squadron is about the adventures of Rogue Squardon, the best Fighter Squadron in the Galaxy. I really enjoyed this book."
5,This book kicks off a great series. A must read.,"Once you read this book you'll be wanting for more. Luckily, the second and third books are in the bookstores now. I can hardly wait for the fourth and final X-Wing book.Michael Stackpole has captured the essence of Star Wars in this series."
1,LAME ARTISTS...,"It's completely obvious that Preta Gil only reach the fame for being daughter of a TRUE artist, the great GILBERTO GIL... What i can't understand is why Preta wants so badly to be famous...She tries to be an actress, a singer, an entertainer on the Carnaval...Well, what she really wanna do???? Go away, Preta...Don't destroy the great name of your father, the great Gilberto Gil!"
5,love it,"ultra fast shipping :-D... an this thing is awsome.totaly recomended if your looking for a reliable db display, its accurate..unlike the one i use to own.. ""Technical Pro Dbb28"" it was way off an deffective..this one i would give 10stars if i had the option..dont hesitate its well worth the buy"
1,The worst product ever,"These are the worst cartridges. They don't snap in right. Your photo colors come out with a greenish tint. I have checked everything on the printer. The simple fact - when we use original Canon replacement cartridges, the colors look right. When we use Amazon Imaging, the colors are horribly flawed. Save yourself the headache we caused ourselves and buy the original only.When I found out these weren't original cartridges (since Amazon.com's product description is woefully inadequate), I tried to get a refund from Amazon.com. They denied me saying that the product description was clear. I am very upset at both Amazon Imaging and Amazon.com."
1,Nothing cookie about it...,"These bars taste nothing like cookies or cream. They're a strange flavor of cocoa flavored cardboard and chewy stuff. Stick with the peanut better flavor. It's 1,000 times better."
5,Beautiful,"Beautiful fragrance. Could not fault this company for thier service, quality and price and would have no hesitation in recommending them to others or using them again."
2,Cover photo?,"It's a nice over sized photo book, but the reason I bought it was because the picture shown on this item on Amazon caught my attention. The wood work on that photo item was beautiful & inspirational and I was sold, but when I received the book, it was no where to be found. I looked through the entire book 3 times searching for that art piece, but nothing. Very disappointing. Oh yeah, the book itself...if you appreciate Art Deco and already have several books on it, they all look alike."
2,Low performance on Linux,"First I must mention that the package or manual does not say this card supports Linux, but it's using Realtek 8169 chipset which driver 'r8169' is already in kernel 2.4 or 2.6, I downloaded the latest 'r1000' and still couldn't get anything higher than 80Mbps under kernel 2.4.20. Some users reported on newsgroup for this known performance issue on Linux, and one was able to crank it up to 240Mbps running a 3.2GHz AMD system. Since this card is not meant to support Linux and I haven't tried it on Windows I would give it a 2 stars to be fair."
3,"This card works, but I'm going to return it","I bought this card for a home gigabit network, this one was going in an XP PC. I am planning to return it for 3 reasons:- It does not have Microsoft certified drivers. That means if it conflicts with your system and causes crashes, that's your problem (and it's more likely than with certified drivers). Netgear is still selling this card, today in early Sept 2005, but the last drivers are from late 2003. There's no excuse for a large company's products to claim XP compatability these days and not have certified drivers.- This NIC is not ""native gigabit"". For whatever reason, it does not run in gigabit mode until drivers are loaded. I'm used to NICs that are gigabit when they power up, well before any system software is running. Why this one doesn't, I'm not sure. That's connected to a Netgear gigabit switch.- Unlike many NICs, it is not supported out of the box by Windows XP.So back it goes... I'd suggest looking at the more reputable vendor like Linksys."
3,Don't wear socks with these,If you wear these with socks LOOK OUT they got caught on a sock and the anklet can't be fixed. I'm mot a happy camper
2,Even good writers have an off day!,"I have read just about every one of Mick Foley's other works and have found him to be not only an entertainer in the squared circle, but a thoroughly engrossing storyteller with a great characterization of whatever personalities who places in his book, whether fictional or non-fictional. However, even though yes, I do understand that this is a child's book, it still fell a little flat. These are heroes that kids may look up to in the wrestling ring, and I did not feel that the average child would be able to relate to them drawn as children. I also did not feel the amount of time or care put into it as in his other books. Unfortunately it felt as if it were rushed together to meet a deadline. Sorry Mick!"
2,Lists mostly correspondence,"This is book has most of the correspondence between British officials and Indians during 1940-1947,it lacks analysis from the author,so it's not recommended for some one who wants to Know basics of Indian freedom struggle,the book is also little boring towards the end."
2,Cool looking - nightmare assembly,"My 9 yr old son just received this Hot Wheels Car Wash for his birthday. It needs no batteries, but is supposed to wash cars with soap & water (through pumps & mini hoses). It looks REALLY cool.I consider myself a patient, common sense, mechanically inclined individual. The assembly of this car wash took me approximately 2 hours of quiet, focused, uninterupted time.Have not tried the water/soap feature yet, since the clear cylinder pieces did not fit together snugly. I am concerned the car wash will leak all over and am not certain the stickers will stay stuck on after running wet cars over them a few times. Also, the cylinder sponges inside the wash keep popping off when the car elevator is cranked up through them.I do not recommend this product to someone who hates assembling things or is annoyed with messes..."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I have been looking for bible stories that my almost 5 year old great granddaughter would watch.She was asking for Daniel and the Lions Den. I think for an older child these would be good, but forher, they did not get into the story soon enough."
3,Wii educational games,I was surpised at how few educational video gamesare available for the Wii. This one was worth buying.
2,Pretty mediocre,"This game was surprisingly poor, considering the rave reviews I've seen.The colorful line-art graphics are trippy, but the controls are just plain painful. In this Wii game, you have to painstakingly point the wiimote at the screen at all times to aim, while flying around with your nunchuck.Want to use the analog sticks on your Gamecube controller instead? Whoops. Unsupported.You can perhaps use a classic controller, if you're one of the three people who bought one, I guess.In addition, the actual gameplay is pretty uninspired. The battle areas are cramped and featureless, the enemy behaviors are extremely simple, and there's really no strategy other than picking your drone's weapon before the battle starts.I lost interest in about half an hour."
5,A very moving book,"I purchased a copy of ""Sotto"" at the recent book launch and took it on holiday to Gran Canaria where I read it in about two days!It was a very moving book (I found myself nearly crying on more than one occasion) and full of apparent coincidence, which later turn out to be linked in some way. Even the smallest detail could not be called insignificant.I have now passed it on to my boyfriend (another Mark) who also seems to be enjoying it too."
4,This book is good for a mid-entry Technical Writer,"It covers a lot in the 400+ pages of which it is comprised. Much of it is devoted to the planning stages of creating a technical document (with emphasis on software user guides). This book would be great for anyone who has between 1-3 years technical writing experience, or anyone attempting to implement new documentation procedures for their department. I still refer to the book from time to time. It also serves as a very good reference tool."
5,If you read only one tech writing book . . .,"If you read only one tech writing book, this should be that book. Saying neither too much nor too little, this book steps you through everything you need to know, from where and how to find the background documents you need in order to learn about your subject, through how to schedule your project, to how to produce your outline, drafts, and finished document. Read this book!"
2,Out-of-date book about writing a user's manual,"This is a 1993 book about how to write a manual for a computer application. If you are writing a manual, it will give you some helpful ideas. However, it was written, and published with a different title, before the Internet. It does not truly help you with communicating tchnical information -- just how to write a manual."
3,Disappointing/mediocre,"I agree with the above review about the several problems with this video. I just ordered all 13 dvd's of this series. We watched Jonah last night, and that was a good one. This was was disappointing. I don't understand why these bible series' can't just stick to the story as it is written in scriptures.1)They have to add all these imaginary things that never happen in real life.2)In this particular video they added way too much dialog that isn't noted in the scripture, some which is questionable.3)I totally hated how they didn't follow the scriptures consistantly in this story. They had Adam and Eve name the animals instead of Adam naming them before Eve was created. This was probably done to keep from offending people who are feminists. I hate that kind of stuff with a passion.4) I did not care for God being an all seeing eye--which is a masonic/cult symbol.The above review by T. Rose is a good one. If you want to read a very good review, I would point you to read his."
4,Chimpanzee,very good movie loved every minute of it never seen anything a cute. would recomend it to anyone i know
2,Boring Seen Better,I've seen many documentaries and this was pretty bad. The story dragged I thought more could have happened. They were cute but the preview was better than the movie the watch the preview it was the whole movie.
4,Review,"The film was great, I was just very disappointed because I thought I had ordered it in 3D. When I went back & checked I can't find anywhere that does offer it in 3D. So, it was my mistake, I'm just very disappointed"
3,"Good Cd, Outrageus Price","This song is a great song even though I haven't heard much of the whole CD. But the one thing that bothers me is the price of this 'single'? 13 bucks for a single? Whats up with that, I could but the whole cd for that price."
2,A more subdued bowie,"I just couldn't get into this one. For some reason I felt like this CD was just too subdued, even for Bowie. The album seems too depressing at times and not in a good way. (ala Station to Station)"
4,"Good shoes, but no half sizes","These jellies are comfy and stylish-looking. I get lots of comments on them. My only wish is that they would come in half-sizes. I had to get the next size higher, and they're just a tad too loose."
4,Helpful,I found Java in a Nutshell very helpful.In the beginning of the book it explainsa sample program line for line. This is usefulfor a beginning Java programmer.
3,Not a good book on 1.4 features,"I have purchased this edition with lot of expectations that i will find all the 1.4 features in this edition with a reasonable amount of coverage. But i am disappointed. The coverage on the new features are given here.1. Assert - 4 Pages2. Logging - 1 Page3. New IO - 11 Pages4. XML - 4 Pages5. Preferences API - 2 Pages6. JASS and JSSE - None7. Regular Expressions - None8. Security - Same as in 1.2If you are new to Java Programming this is still probably one of the best out here. but if you are an experienced Java Programmer who already have Java in a Nutshell previous edition, you may not find this very useful."
4,Book for reference only,"Excellent reference book (I wish I can stop my review here.) I expected more on overview of Java, and more (clear) examples, since I was fairly new to Java. I was not concerned with JDK versioning, but there is inadequate cover of 1.4.My suggestionfor beginners: read Thinking in Java first.for experienced developers: use it as a reference, get another book on a particular subject of interest."
2,Very disappointing,"I have always admired Charleston Heston, and purchased this DVD because of his involvement. But...the quality wasn't there, and it certainly didn't hold the interest of a preschooler. Not sure who this video is made for."
4,Pretty good,We've taken this camping with us several times and it has always done its job. I think I've accidentally broken the green plastic on a couple of spikes though. I probably should have just bought a rubber mallet and some extra spikes but I feel like I've gotten a decent deal with this package.
3,"Nicely Organized, but not crazy about the stakes","We purchased this along with a tent for our first Cub Scout Family Campout. After reading the reviews I decided that these sturdier stakes would be better. These stakes are much larger than the ones that come with the tent. We camped on grassy but hard ground. The stakes were hard to hammer in and were VERY hard to remove (we even poured water on them ahead of time). We bent all 4 stakes fighting to pull them out. We used a few of the stakes that came with the tent and they were much easier to work with. We are NOT hardcore campers, so we plan to stick with the regular stakes. I am not too disappointed in the purchase since I really like the bag. I'm keeping all my stakes in it along with the mallet & stake puller. It keeps the items organized nicely!"
1,Poor quality,First item on amazon I have been disappointed by. The hammer fell apart after one use. Do not buy. Literally hammered in one stake before the top of the hammer fell off - looks substantial in the image but did not hold up for me.
1,Tent stakes arrived pre-rusted,"I'm sure that this is a handy kit to have. The tent stakes are much sturdier than the ones that came with my tent. For me, they also arrived pre-rusted -- a significant amount of rust covering most of the metal surfaces on all 4 stakes.For what I paid for the item plus 2-day shipping, I'd prefer to rust my own stakes. These are going back.=M="
1,cheep,Nice kit but we needed more spikes and the plastic tops to the spikes broke while I was trying to remove them from the ground. The claw to help remove them did not work well.
5,Handy Set,"This set is pretty good. The stakes are nice and sturdy, the hammer isn't bad, the stake puller works for my tent stakes, and the broom/pan do what they are supposed to. I don't regret my purchase."
3,Handy but not needed,"This set is of good quality. These stakes are the only type we can use for more than a season. They do not bend or get lost in the sand. The top of the stake does come lose so you have to make sure it is pulled to the top before you put it in the ground. The rubber mallet is good quality and fairly heavy. The stake puller worked out really well especially in the sand. The broom and dust pan was really too small to do much good but was handy for spot cleaning. I still have to have my regular size broom to sweep out the tent before folding it. I was kind of disappointed with the quality of the broom and dust pan. They were just not as hearty as I have come to expect from Coleman. I would not say this set is a must have for camping, but it does come in handy."
3,It's okay,"This was part of the same deal as the Coleman light package when I purchased the tent, would not buy it on it's own."
2,Hammer is cheap,"This is nice, but the hammer head started to spin after the first use. This kit doesn't come with enough stakes for the entire tent, so make sure that you buy extra."
4,Great impulse buy!,"I did not set out to buy this kit, I just needed one more item to get Free Shipping. I AM SO GLAD I BOUGHT IT!!! I go camping at least once a year, and it's usually rainy, windy, and muddy for at least one to two of the 4 days. The extra stakes turned out to be a necessity, and the mallet pleases my aging bones. While I still haven't used the broom, IT WAS REALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE THE STAKE PULLER. For a price of under $20 it was a perfect impulse buy!"
5,An excellent source book for beginners and veterans alike.,"This book is easy reading and packed full on tips. The authors reveal tips about elk that unless yu have spent years among them in the wild you will never learn. I have bowhunted for 6 years. This was only my 2nd year bowhunting elk. I read the book to give me a little edge and it worked. I won't be one of the people these guys refer to that go years without getting an elk. The tips in this book and all of the information about elk refreshes your memory about what you CAN do to improve your chances of having a successful season. I plan to read it again next year before I head out after these elusive and majestic mammals. Get it, read it, try it. Good luck!"
4,Good book... better if you already have a broke dog or 10!,"I trained my first dog using the Delmar Smith method, supplemented w/ info from friends, pros, and other authors (when things were not working out). I bought and read Mr. Williams' book and finding it an enjoyable read, was nevertheless a bit disappointed, I must say. His method centers around running experienced and novice dogs together so the youngsters will learn the game of hunting; good when you already have a string of trained dogs.However, upon bringing my 2nd pup home, this book really hit home. I ran the pup w/ the older dog ~50% of the time afield and had him searching, pointing, and backing at 7 months w/ little work on my part. His tips for working dogs together were invaluable and have really helped my pup come into his own as a bird finder!In addition, this book is loaded w/ great tips on hunting w/ pointers in general; it is well written and comes well recommended (after you check out the Smith and West methods)."
5,Direct hit on the nerves,This book tells about acholism and how you can lose then earn back your love for someone. It's a love story action and mind warping story with heartbreaking parts. This book made me cry! I'm sensitive. This book makes you feel like your the protagonist
1,This is the worst book I have ever read.,"This is by far the worst piece of 'literature' I have ever been unfortunate enough to read. This book is supposed to deal with 'real life' issues of young adults when in all actuality is nothing more than a shameless attempt at hack writing. Remember how R.L. Stine wrote crappy horror stories for children to make money... this is worse. Not only does it have nothing to do with adolescent issues, it in some ways promotes rape, drinking, and violence. This is by far the most horrible story I have ever read. This story is also not even written very well. Worst Book Ever."
2,Good start to a bad ending,"A mysterious paper that ends up predicting all major catastrophes catches your attention. The movie starts out enjoyable, fun, and suspenseful; too bad the ending spoiled the film. The ending was weakly tied into the storyline, and really killed the plot. I won't go into details so as not to ruin the experience, but don't expect a blockbuster hit ending.I have no intention of purchasing this film. Rent it first before making it an addition to the collection."
1,Dreadful!,"Basic idea behind this film - believe in god, go to heaven; don't believe in god - burn in hell. Not that heaven looks all that appealing, if it's inhabited by sinister non-talking angels who frighten you half to death. The production budget must have been high, but the acting is flat, the premise is incredibly flawed and unbelievable (not to mention boring), and you're left at the end wondering if that's all there is - a scary Eden. If you like fire and brimstone and the idea that nonbelievers, despite being fellow human beings and decent people, all burn in hell, you'll probably like this awful film."
2,"Underwhelming, anticlimatic, and dull","I won't give anything away about the movie because I don't believe in spoilers in reviews. But I will tell you that once this huge ""secret"" came out, it ended up being SOOOOOOOO anticlimatic that I felt that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life.You might like it though! If I have learned one thing in my life, its that many people are easily impressed. If you happen to be someone who gets excited over a hack-piece with a flimsy story line and disappointing 'surprises,"" you might find this film acceptable in spite of its mediocrity."
2,Ehh!!--Just Kinda Lays On You Like A Heavy Meal!!,"We've seen bits and pieces of this script in severalof these ""apocalypto-clairvoyant"" films that have come outin recent years. It was also very unbelievable (acting-wise)in certain places, interesting in some places, had goodspecial effects...but overall very uneven throughout.After it was over, I felt like I had just eaten a10 course meal on the holidays!--Ugghh!! (-:It just kinda sat there for awhile!It's an okay rental if you are into this kind of movie,but I wouldn't buy it when there are much better films alreadymade in this particular genre of sci-fi/prophecy."
4,I wrote this without really knowing what to say.,"Nicolas Cage was great in ""Knowing"". I liked the story and the acting. The special effects were pretty cool too. The plot of this movie is about a girl in 1959, and how she...hmm. I think I will stop there. I have already given away too much. I apologize for not writing ""SPOILER ALERT"" at the start of my review. I give this four starts."
1,Terrible,"What utter you know what this movie was! What happened to Nicolas Cage? He used to make great movies (Raising Arizona, Vampire's Kiss, etc.). Recent years - he's choosing horrible scripts and bringing nothing to these awful roles. But for Knowing - nothing and nobody could help this pointless movie. It's a ripoff of the movie Signs. Except Signs was well done with compelling characters and an interesting (and simple) story which let the characters be. Knowing has so many completely unnecessary plot twists which destroy the possibility that this film could have been a good story about a man's loss of faith and recovery in the face of apocalyptic circumstances. It just tries to do so much. The dialogue is so cliche - it actually makes me cringe. I just can't imagine who in Hollywood writes and supervises these scripts? I know there are capable folks though because the new Star Trek movie was fantastic. Story and dialogue."
1,Not Worth $1 Rental Fee.,"It does have a storyline, an accomplishment these days. But it is a nasty story, and outstretched too."
2,"Starts good, ends ""Huh?""","Knowing started off good. I got pulled into the numbers-catastrophes thing and the overall atmosphere of the film, created by a muted palette of greens and grays against an autumn setting. Then it went out of control. It felt like the writers didn't know what to do so they just made something up as they went:""What do we do now?""""How about some aliens?""""Sure. Put that in.""Without giving it away, we've been to this movie before. Knowing is a decent 2-star, throwaway flick when you have nothing else to rent."
3,Knowing should have Known better!,"The movie had real potential and a good story line. And then about half-way through, I thought to myself, please don't end the way I thought it would.Then the final scene and sure enough, just like I had hoped it wouldn't end, it did. I was sorely disappointed they took the easy and ridiculous way out of this movie. That last 5 minutes really spoiled the entire show for me, so I won't spoil for someone who hasn't seen it.Great graphics...especially the plane crash...wow that was memorable!All in all, a good movie with a stupid ending. Knowing should have Known better!"
2,aliens will not save you,"I gave this movie 2 stars; but if it wasn't for the decent special effects, I would have given it 1 star. Why? Because of all the false teaching regarding Creation and the End of the World. Aliens did not put us on Earth; aliens will not save any of us when it is destroyed. Jesus is the beginning and the end; the Almighty, the Creator. There is much evidence from the Bible that Jesus will return soon. Unfortunately, movies like Knowing and 2012 are spreading lies about the End and other matters.Read what the Bible says about the End. Make no mistake; you will know when it happens, and you will know that God is bringing the End (it will not be some natural or man-made disaster). Take a moment and read 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10, and Revelation 6:14-17. View my profile; visit my website. May God have mercy on your soul while it is still the day of salvation."
1,Wrong title,"Should have been called ""The Rapture"" or ""Yo, Jesus!"" I want my two hours back. Seriously, not too cool of the studio to masquerade this ""make good with the christian god"" movie as some sort of scifi/mystery/thriller :(The only things I can't figure out: how did Kirk Cameron hide his involvement, and which 'left behind' movie was this supposed to be?"
4,Spooky sci-fi thriller like X-Files,"I liked this movie. It's sort of a spooky sci-fi thriller like X-Files. The music, settings, etc. add much tension. It keeps your interest, and may blow your mind at times. Although, it also leaves some unanswered questions and inconsistencies.Great special FX and interesting visuals. A sequence involving an airplane crash stands out because of how real it seems, and it appeared to be all done in one shot. However, the scenes can be somewhat disturbing. My only problems are the ending gets a little hokey, and the movie should be a bit shorter."
4,"Expecting much more, Blu-ray quality is there","I was expecting much much more than it delivered, though it is definately worth watching. Watching this movie on Blu-ray is the way to go. I don't want too sound to negative,But where is the fear! I am just not feeling it, I should be scared as ****. Something tragic is about to happen right? Nicholas Cage is a little disappointing as one other reviewer noted for this type of role. There are some spectacular satellite shots of earth and other scenes (don't want to spoil it for you), that are fantastic. Sound quality is very good on Blu-ray and is what should be expected. If were to compare this film and War of the worlds with Tom Cruse, War of the worlds would win hands down. That's just my opinion and every body has one."
1,Dumbest movie I have seen in a long time,Someone on this movie crew needs to take a community college class in scriptwriting. Big important events should be foreshadowed somehow. This movie had a couple that were so unbelievable they weren't even funny. And at least one of the repeated clues ended up...meaning not much of anything. And then there are rabbits.Watch it if you must but please rent it don't buy it.
1,Determinism wins; all human effort is irrelevant,"""Knowing"" is a movie that starts out telling one sort of story, and ends with a different type of story. Without giving away any significant details, at the end of this you'll have realized that you spent two hours watching a story about striving to fight destiny -- and in the end, it's all futile; no humans can change anything. (Only creepy/helpful aliens can do that, and only for rare, special humans.)There are also quite a lot of annoying goofs in the movie, many of them having to do with being filmed in Australia but supposedly set in the northeastern USA (Massachusetts and New York).I'd strongly caution against watching ""Knowing"" unless you can handle an ending which has nothing to do with any actions taken by any of the characters. I found that quite unsatisfying."
3,Predictable,"Actor and actresses were good. However, the plot was predictable. Cage is an excellent actor and his performance made the movie worth watching."
1,What a load of propaganda,"I had a hard time watching the movie because is was a bit slow but I was curious to see the outcome so I stuck with it. Yeah, it's not sci-fi, it's some kind of new testament mumbo jumbo trying to sell the word to masses through mainstream. I don't wan't to spoil it but you'll see what I mean at the end. Please, it reeks of blasphemy on both evolution and creationism. The whole numerology thing was a complete farce to get ppl somewhat interested. What a waste of time. Now I am going to take this rental copy and burn it so that I may save future ppl from this trash."
3,Who knows where the time goes?,"This title seemed intestesting at first blush and held my attention until the unearthying of the time capsule after which it was downhill all the way.Oddly reminiscent of Next and number 23 at times, this pseudo science fiction/suspense/horror flick left more questions unanswered than not. There is a basic fault with the entire premise which is why did the aliens not just come and kidnap the people they wanted at the time rather than go through all of the palava they took us through.By the time I had got to the end of the somewhat predictable movie angered by the weird economics they must have had on the alien world that they could send all these spacecraft billions of miles just to pick two kids up per ship and take them somewhere else which had a single tree, I was just exasperated.It was a good job it only cost a dollar from a kiosk because it is not worth any more than that."
4,Not too bad I must say,"You know, this movie was not all that bad. I really went into it thinking that it was going to be pretty crappy but I was very happy when all was said and done. The whole movie was pretty entertaining. I would highly recommend it to everyone, and if you can't take a little religion in a movie like some people who have reviewed this movie, then don't watch it. It didn't shove anything down your throat! Movie... all in all... pretty darn good."
5,Excellent Movie! Riveting & Lovely,"This movie is compelling, gripping, inspiring and has unique special effects that go beyond the normal blow up scenes. From performances to story to pure entertainment to inspiration, this film has depth and does not compromise in any way. It provides a unique look at reality and possibilities, while keeping true to believable human situations and the general anguish of being human. Really a lovely movie! We were riveted. It is not for stupid or cliche people but why why why didn't we hear of it sooner when so much junk is crammed at us by narcissists who just want to see themselves look good on screen. This was just beautiful, and offers so much beyond the usual Hollywood ""look at me and give me your money"" or cold treatments of space and the future. THANKS to director,producer and actors."
2,"If You're Gay It's OK...If You're Straight, Run For The Gate","I reviewed this book at the request of an alternative publication. I was asked if I would review it and was told that it was about water sports. Since I don't in principal, have any problem with that subject, I agreed to read and review it.Upon reading the book I discovered it covers heavy water sports between males only. It is written by and for gay men and is not of particular use to straight couples. It contains brief sections of ""fact"" interspersed with sections of ""fictional"" material that cover the subject. Most of the material is geared towards ""hardcore"" enthusiasts and has little to offer the ""recreational"" player.In addition to the above issues, I found poor editing. There were numerous typographical errors and punctuation issues. Not a very good read, even for gays with inclinations toward this type of sexual behavior."
2,Too 'tutti frutti' for me,"I love the sensation I get from the mint shampoo I use and was hoping I'd found a body wash to provide the same.Unfortunately, in Archipelago's formula, the mint is completely overpowered by other fragrances (orange, florals).Now, obviously a lot of people like resulting fragrance. I don't.I guess my biggest beef, though, is that it's marketed as 'mint' and - for me - the mint's pretty much undetectable.Won't repurchase."
3,nisht so gut,I was a little disapointed with this body wash- i was expecting a really strong refreshing minty menthol feeling- and it was more citrusy and dry- if you are looking for a really refreshing minty wash- i wouldnt buy this.
4,me likey: part 2,same as the 6th season.....worth buying......you should like it a lot. but if you heard him back in 99-02 then you would undertand my 4 star rating.
1,Awful Product,"I hate this litterbox!!!! I had the old version for a year and it worked great for my 2 cats. So when it broke I naturally went with littermaid again and decided to get this one since it was a upgrade. After 2 weeks of constantly raking the litterbox myself, removing clumps and resetting it cause it cant even push a little piece of poop anywhere I turned it off. i was better off cleaning the litterbox myself than this thing doing its job. Well after 6 months I decided to turn it on and give it a try again.Oh man this product is awful, it cannot push anything thru it has no power behind it and try to contact the warranty department. What a joke! So now I have a $200 litterbox I have to clean myself. What a waste of money!!!"
2,Stiffler serves up some dull fare,"This film was really 2.5 stars, to be fair. I feel that a better script could have helped here, and the pacing was quite clunky. Stiffler was as ever Stiffler and I found his character rather endearing, I actually cared what happended to the team. And to be fair, he wasnt a bad coach, he knew the game and had a fair understanding of what makes people tick, but a rather unconventional way of realising that dream. The acting really was ok, just let down by a poor script and direction.I wouldnt NOT recommend this film, I would just recommend better gross out comedies than this. If you have see all the usual ones, and have 90 mins to kill, you could do worse than this. Alternatively you could spend the time cleaning your guttering, its your choice."
4,great movie,Hilarious movie. Came across it by accident while renting movies one night and loved it.
3,Magnificent Smith,"Steve McQueen was in two great westerns. Everyone knows Magnificent Seven, but this is one not everyone is familiar with. Along with his great characterization of a half breed that seeks revenge we see excellent performances put in by Karl Malden, Suzanne Pleshette and many others. Those that have seen it know its great value as you can tell from their reviews. If you like westerns this is one not to miss. He will track his parents killers to the ends of the Earth if need be. He even purposely goes to one of the worst prisons to get one. His skills as a gunfighter and knife fighter put the fear of God into his quarry as they find out he is tracking them.therooksnook"
4,Neveda Smith DVD,"Steve McQueen, what can you say? And it is helping me add to my western collection.Was a little rough in spots in the story line/scenes as I don't care for that graphic depiction."
4,A Classic Western,"This is a classic western that stars Steve McQueen in the title roll. This movie was made in the time of big westerns and is typical of the genre. The settings are good with the requisite tragedy, strife, personal growth, horsemanship, gun fights and redemption. Well worth watching if you are a fan of this type of movie. It should be noted this was made when Steve McQueen may not have yet been at the height of his work."
5,My Library,Just filling out my McQueen library..God Bless America! .God Bless America! .God Bless America! .God Bless America!
4,Mcqueen's Best Western Film,"Steve Mcqueen is excellent in this well done western revenge thriller Nevada Smith, a young half breed man seeks revenge agaisnt a lethal gang who murdered his parents. Along the way Smith learns proper gun handeling technicqes and as he draws closer to his prey he relazies that revenge isn't all what it seems. Very well played story about revenge and the conseqeunces that goes along with it and the lonliness that transpires from being consumed from the hate. A Western that also looks at the rights of indians not often seen in Westerns. Steve Mcqueen pulled off a very belivable, and powerful performence."
5,Go get em Max...just don't forget the way home,"This movie is a great study on revenge. Steve McQueen plays Max Sand who chases the killers of his father and mother. Along the way he meets Brian Keith, in what is possibly one of his best roles, as the gun dealer Jonas Cord. Jonas takes Max under his wing and plays mentor to help him find the killers. This is after trying to get Max to realize the challenges that he must face in order to find, survive and shoot the killers. The dialogue and friendship between Jonas and Max is the best part of the movie.I enjoyed the ending very much but wished they would have gone a little bit further in showing what becomes of Max. This is another movie that not many know about but should."
1,"WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, OR EVEN BORROW IT!","My class read this book for comprehension, and I thought it was pretty detestable. For one thing, it did not draw me in, and had a bad plot, which was very predictable. Like a boy that is 11 is actaully going to drive and not get caught. Also everything was in the same pattern, AND ABSOULUTLY NO SUSPENSRE was included. Also, the charecters, Aaron and Robert where very flimsy and fake, and all the other characters in the book where to. I think these are good reasons for giving this book one star. Hopefully, if I have the ""courage"" to read the next book, Trouble at Marsh Harbor, it will be better. Thank you for listening."
5,Excellent purchase,THe book was as advertised in really good condition. I'm very satisfied with the purchase. The only thing that I didn't like that much was that there was no International Express shipping method and I had to wait for more than 3 weeks to get it... Nevertheless I would definately recommend the seller. Thanx
4,Tom Baker at his best,Very enjoyable story. Has our beloved Doctor turned evil and sold out Gallifrey to alien invaders? Tom Baker's acting is top notch. My only complaint about the story is Leela's romance with a Gallifreyian soldier is not very believable-no chemistry between them at all. I highly recommend this episode to other Dr. Who fans.
5,satisfied,Sorry it took so long to review..had problems with Amazon..they wouldn't let me rate you..think it is working now(:thanks again.
3,Warning: this is the remixed version,"This music is inspiring, pastoral, uplifting, and meditative. At times it melts with the scenery, then suddenly soars above it. This is not pop music. You must take the time to let it envelop you. It is not for everyone. I would have given this CD 5 stars, but this is the REMIXED version from the Boxed set (1976), which other fans, myself included, find disappointing. The horn part that was unfortunately mixed out here on side 1 was one of my personal favorites. Those familiar with the original pressing will find something missing. I've been informed that Mike considers this mix the definitive version and has ordered that all future pressings be from the remix. I hope that someday Mike will reconsider releasing the original version on CD. For now, I'll listen to the original 1974 vinyl release. If you have recently tuned into Oldfield, perhaps you can get a copy of it through an internet auction."
5,This music is a visit to another time and place,"""Hergest Ridge"" is pure magic - there is nothing quite its equivalent. It transports you to another magical world where time has stopped. Oldfield's talents are in evidence here. This may be an obscure recording, but it is a treasure!"
1,Don't go here!,"The pedals look good, but are impossible to install, it makes Rubic's Cube look simple. Plus once you do get them on, they don't stay there, so if you want custom pedals, ""Don't go here"""
2,Not as tan as i thought,This is an easy to do self tanner. Best for beginners to get the hang of it without the problems you might get with more powerful systems. It has little to no smell. It leaves your skin feeling good. It's biggest drawback is that it's just very weak. 2 days later very little left to notice. Expensive when you consider i used the whole canister for that.
2,"Not worth it, there are better options.","The color is good, but that's it. It really does not last more than 2 days.The main reason for the poor review is the actual spray nozzle and ""spray gun"". The 'gun' is just a holder, it does not actually have its own nozzle. The product - even after shaking for literally minutes - does not come out even. It will either come out in large droplets or in a very fine mist with almost no color. Therefore, it's all but impossible to get an even coat.If the nozzle actually put out a fine mist all of the time, it would be worth the low price. But I used the entire can in one application that lasted maybe 2 days because it was impossible to get an even coating. Try something else."
3,Follow the instructions,"I tried this product a while back. What I liked about this product was that it gave me an instant tan. However, the instructions said that I had to wipe the tip of the spraying gun after every spray. Also, I had to protect the surrounding furnitures with newspaper, so that they wouldn't stain, so it wasn't too convenient for me. Other than that, I thought this was a different tanning product that worked. I stick with the tanning lotions though."
1,useless applicator and refills.,i have been using bodydrench spray mist but it was out of stock from my regular dealer so i went with this stuff. the main problem is that it shoots a jet stream for a sec b4 going to mist. so everytime you pull the trigger it will shoot a stream and then go to mist (even when you wipe the tip between sprays). very messy and ineffective.
1,Spend your money else where,This product was not worth the money i spent on it. i put lotion on my feet before hand as instructed yet now my feet are orange and my toenails are yellow! I gave my skin 24hrs to dry and in the shower it still washed most of the product off. I have orange sploches all over and am still mostly pale. when the spray came out of the gun it didnt spray evenly and we ended up having to just dab the product on. also customer service was very unhelpful and rude. i suggest you go somewhere else for a tanning product unless you want to look like a spotted oompa loompa
1,Green,Green spray isn't tan spray and that's all I have to say. Very dissapointing product that had good reviews here.
3,Good,"This CD is good but it would have been better had it included the John Parker main and end titles from the first season. I mean, he did write the theme, for Pete's sake."
5,Wow. This show rocks.,"This is Black Sabbath from 1978, right before Ozzy was to leave for good. The video is superb quality for that year. I get pissed at people who compare this to something that was released a year ago. For cryin out loud, this thing is 25 years old! It's not gonna have widescreen! Anyway, the thing is recorded at a very low volume, so if you want to headbang you'll have to crank your amp.This DVD serves as a blueprint for how they should have done Last Supper. There are no interviews, no cutting away from the show. Just a straight up live concert with no commentary. Maybe they'll get it straight next time!"
3,Bit dissapointing,"ok first off, the sound on the drums and guitars was awesome. The vocal sound was terrible."
3,Coleman multi-purpose lantern stand....not so sturdy,"OK, I bought it and discovered two things, First, it works. Second, it's kinda flimsey. With the old 220 lantern series it's steady but it flexes more than I would like. The stake feature in the base really should be more horizontal so that some serious tent type stakes could be used. The cheapo wire stakes that come with the unit are too weak to be of use. The nylon case is OK, it's not going to last too long and putting the stand in it is a bit of a PITA. Do not buy this with the idea that you will hang a Pertomax or Britelyte lamp on it. Those are way too heavy to be safe. All in all, a servicable but not heavy-duty ,Chicom made stand. OK, but not what Coleman used to make that's for sure."
5,Surprisingly useful,Bought this on a whim because it was so cheap. It's amazing how tall this extends too. We put this out on a beach on a recent camping trip and were able to play horseshoes and bocci late into the night because the light coverage is so good.
1,We just want our name back,"I am the daughter of the orginal trombone player and co-founder of the Dukes, Freddy Assunto. I have to tell you that we are now re claiming our name. John Shoup has mis represented the name for 25 + years and we have gotten it taken care of finally. After 25 years we have finally figured it out. Stay tuned to your news to find out the details. Still too fresh to let any cats out of the bag. Angel Assunto Soulas"
1,We want the real Mccoy!,"I don't know how John Shoup stole the name of the Dukes,but it's highway robbery. In no way is this band honoring the original Dukes. I had the pleasure of hearing them and meeting them in Chicago in the late l950's and collected all their work on Audiophile and, originally with Pete Fountain on clarinet. I have been duped into buying this second-rate journeyman band and believe that it's a crime. Buyers, beware and check the personnel on the recording before you buy. This band had also played in Melbourne, Florida and the response was very disappointing."
4,Great book - could use more expanded proofs,"Great book that explains things well. Some of the examples could use proofs to flesh out exactly how they arrived at the conclusions, but over all a good explanations of difficult topics."
5,Stephen Brust makes a dark fantasy series...YES!,"While reading ""Jhereg"" one can imagine that there aren't many novels that have something called darkness within excitement (unless you've read Ann Rice), but with this novel, you get suspense, magic, and the thing called intensity all rolled into a fantasy-bun. Brust's novel is the best interpretation of the novel that began with sinister characters that had good motives. With an assassin that plays the main character, Vlad Taltos, it is even foreshadowing this dark fantasy. What is meant by that is that the story just grips your spine and makes you keep reading with the excitement of who and what and where...all the w's needed to make someone interested in any novel are all here. For all those that love novels dealing with the occult or such would seriously consider going to ""Jhereg"" first."
3,Not Bad,"I liked this tea but it is kind of regular in flavor. It doesn't stand out in my opinion. It is just there in taste. So if it is on sale buy it, if not pass."
3,The cuss words were beeped out.,A few occasions the movie has cuss words. We view this DVD privately and these cuss words add fun to the dialogues.
2,"Geez, I feel out of step with these gushing reviews.","I am a big Oldfield fan (thanks to Stevie M.), especially of his long form works, Tubular Bells, Hergest Ridge, Ommadawn, Incantations, etc. I own 16 different Oldfield CD's, albums and cassettes (plus the box set Elements) so I believe I qualify as a fan.I bought this CD the second I saw it on the shelf in 1996, listened to it twice through, once again on day 2 and put it away forever. Well, almost. I tried to listen to it again a couple of times since and have to say that I CANNOT.It is a boring, unlistenable collection of warmed over new age pablum. When I saw Mike as a Middle Earth Elf Warrior on the cover I thought it must be a joke.Sorry Mike. I love your music and have purchased almost all of it in one form or another but even Picasso had an off day or two."
4,Nice product but...,Smell is too strong if using on the whole body but nice for hands. Fragrance is refreshing first thing in the morning.
1,FAULTY PUMP,"THE PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL! BUT... OF THE 3 THAT I BOUGHT AS GIFTS - ONLY ONE OF THE PUMPS WORKED. VERY EMBARRASSING FOR ME. AND IT COMES IN A METAL CONTAINER, YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE IT OUT INTO ANOTHER CONTAINER AND THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY TACKY THING TO HAVE TO DO ANYWAY..."
2,Please Wake Me Up - This Movie Put Me in a DEEP Sleep,"I had very high expectations for this movie, especially given a great Director, Robecca Romijn, and Antonio Banderas.Way wrong! The movie has a bit of a european flair due to much of it being filmed in Paris - however - the movie plot is very difficult to follow, and takes too much effort to try and understand whats going on.Please let me save you the money - select another movie."
1,Utterly confusing,"A story of a ""bad girl"" who steals some priceless diamonds & runs away & hides in Paris. She falls asleep in the tub and has a weird dream about a girl committing suicide then finally seeing herself being thrown from a bridge. She wakes up in the tub & tells the girl to not to commit suicide & prevents her own death as well. The split screen was difficult to watch. Stamos spent WAY too much time facing away from the camera when she was scantily clad. Boring."
3,Is the fit for humans?,"I bought this to replace the sports one that went up in price the sound quality is great for the price but the fit is horrible. You can't see it but this has a wishbone type of curve to the part that fits near your head, it's uncomfortable and slips down. It takes a lot of getting use to would not recommend it since I wear it a lot to listen to videos, and music online."
2,SUGAR HILL NTSC region 1 DVD is a bootleg,"sorry folks, but the NTSC region 1 available from Blaxploitation Film, or Blaxfilm is a full-frame bootleg, like all of their other titles. i just got this in the mail and it arrived postage due and was on DVD-R. the disc got to the 25 minute mark of the film, artifacted, froze and launched back to the main menu. i wouldn't complain except its the third bootleg in a row I've gotten off of Amazon. the whole reason i purchase from this site and not a cheaper bootleg site is to get an actual archival copy and not a compressed DVD-R. if you want these titles save some money and buy them cheaper off a bootlegging site, since your going to be be getting the same quality DVD-R'S and material sourced from VHS tapes."
5,Never were old Southern bones more respectfully disturbed.,"Margaret Mitchell's Models in Gone With The Wind is a thoroughly original detective story. Its author penetrates a delicate web of fact, fiction, old (very old) rumor, myth, and fantasy. He proceeds unhurriedly, with sympathy and cool judgment. As he journeys into the living backgrounds of Mitchell's novel, Hardman introduces new truths into the rarefied, elusive climate that has traditionally surrounded Mitchell's great romance. After reading this work, I can never again view Gone With The Wind in quite the same way. The author has made Margaret Mitchell and the Gone With The Wind subject much more interesting."
2,A flawed design,"Yes, this mug does keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. But what were they thinking when they failed to design a lid that can be completely closed to prevent leaks?The opening through which you drink is always open...there is no way to close it. So while you are carrying the mug from the house to the car or the car to the office, spilling the contents is terribly easy to do. And other reviewers are right...if this tips over you will have a terrible mess."
5,Love these travel mugs!!!,Keeps coffee piping hot! Lid can be a little tricky if you're not paying attentionl. The vertical lines in the lid need to be lined up exactly right for the lid to screw down tightly. A BIG plus for me is the removable logo on the cup. Beats me why folks are willing to pay a vendor to advertise their products. The first thing I did was to peel off the logo!
4,A little pricey but not bad for [price] during Friday Sale,"Zojirushi still makes the best Stainless Steel tumblers, in comparison to the ones I got off eBay, this is FAR superior!!"
4,Fictional account of the 1799 siege of Acre,"Through the patronage of Lord Kintlesham, Fox has been given the acting command of the Raccoon. After scaring off one duelist and wounding another, he is sent to the Levant carrying dispatches. He allows himself to be drawn into ground action and commands a battery during during Napoleon's siege of Acre (some actual details will be found in the Naval Chronicle, Volume II). Fox distinguishes himself, but the captain from whom he hoped to obtain some patronage is killed. He returns to Palermo, where he discovers some unpleasant surprises - the Kintleshams have departed, taking their patronage with them, and a commander has been given the command of the Raccoon."
3,Good Product for the Price,So far these have held up nicely in the dishwasher. The variety of sizes is also pretty nice. I wish they came in just white though.
2,not like silicone,I have a silicone spatula and these were not like silicone.They are stiff and don't work very good.
2,Great for awhile,"I loved these spatulas when I first started using them about 4 months ago. The different sizes are really versatile and the tops never came off in the dishwasher. However, about 2 weeks ago, i was using one to press bread dough in its bowl and the flexible end snapped right off! I was shocked. i also noticed yesterday that the yellow one has some cracks along its edge, which I'm certain are a breeding ground for bacteria. I'm now in the market for other spatulas and I will not replace these with another set of the same..."
2,Expected a little better quality,These are just the run of the mill cheaply made spatulas. The paddle part is nice because it is silicone but the handles are not heat resistant. I will buy better the next time or if I want a cheap set will pay a cheaper price. Not recemmended.
5,A great buy!,"I had bought these spatulas for my mother and had just recently gave them to her, and she loves them! I myself had gotten to try out these spatulas and they are perfect. The silicone head is sturdy enough and does not wiggle when you mix your ingredients like any other type of spatula. They do a wonderful job getting any left over liquid ingredients out the sides of the container. These are by far the best spatulas I have ever used, and to top it all off they are dishwasher safe! What a deal that is! I recommend anyone looking for new spatulas to purchase this set."
3,Good at first...,These spatulas were great for the first month or so. One by one they snapped off right where the thin part joined the rounded handle area.
4,"So far, so good!","This little player provided my family with entertainment while we drove 2300 miles on our vacation. Our player worked fine hanging in its case, running off the car jack. Additionally, it works very well hooked up to a television. I was reluctant to buy Cyberhome, because I've heard horror stories, but out of the box this unit has impressed me as a great value. Time will tell if some of the other problems voiced here pop up, but I can't image how we would have made it through our trip without it."
1,Deceptive Value,"We bought this portable player and travel bag for a great price. It worked great for our first trip. Second trip the battery, which was fully charged, ran out after about 1 hour. Since then it will not power up or run unless plugged into the wall or car outlet. Also, was unable to hook it up the our home television. The audio worked, but the video didn't. We've only had it 2 months, used it 2 times, and I'm returning it asap! Too bad Consumer Reports doesn't have more info on portable dvd players."
1,Piece of JUNK!!!!!,I have returned two of these players in the past 2 weeks....Buy another brand. I was told by several store employees that Cyberhome DVD players were being returned frequently. HA! There was one in the return buggy ahead of mine.Don't waste your time on this player.
1,DOA,"I tried to buy this unit on sale and ended up waiting 3 weeks with a raincheck before finally locating one. Out of the box, the unit had no picture. I am still waiting for it to come back in stock to exchange it. Reading all of the negatives reviews may convince me to return it outright."
1,Big Disappointment,"Please stay away from this DVD player! I was attracted to its price, progressive scan, and included case that turns into a car converter, but the good things ended there.I had two of these units (I exchanged one after one day of use) and neither even came close to working properly. The battery does not hold a charge (and removing it every time it is not in use is a major pain), the sound and video was often out of synch, black and flickering screen, and poor quality buttons that are unresponsive.It's unfortunate that this player has such terrible build quality because it does have a very nice picture for the price. The list of problems and issues make it impossible for me to reccomend it to anyone though."
1,Never Worked,"We bought this model for the price and what it included. Unfortunately I guess you get what you pay for, especially when the employees really don't have much to say about it. We charged the battery and then decided to test it out. Well all we got was a screen saying that it was reading the DVD. We were able to get it to play once, and even then you could not see the picture."
3,Its all good,"I bought this player and had to return it because the screen went blank (as others have reported). Bought a replacement and the screen was okay but the battery went dead (as others reported). Emailed support and got a response in less than 48 hours. Within a week they sent me a battery conditioner that charges the battery even after it gets discharged from leaving it in the player. Unfortunately you can't leave the battery in the player during long periods of non use. I've read most of the complaints and am lucky that I wasn't as unfortunate as some of the others. Its not the best product, but I certainly am enjoying it and have had success with support. The sound and picture are crisp and clear and all the accessories that it comes with really can't be beat. I can show you the emails that I sent back and forth to the company. Just email me at robsmada@yahoo.com and put the product name and model number in the subect line."
1,waste of money,"We purchased this for a vacation. It didn't even last 2 hours. We exchanged it at a Radio Shack for another of the same. Mistake. We've had pretty much every problem imaginable: no picture, no sound, won't read discs, delayed sound, battery life nonexistent, bad picture, all of which have been sporadic. The last straw was the power jack in the back of the unit failed. We haven't used the unit much since our vacation in August and the warranty ran out two weeks prior to the power jack problem. Cyberhome wants over $99 for labor and $5 for parts--and they would cover the cost of parts IF they decided the unit was not abused (it wasn't). We have contacted them and to say the customer service is bad is an understatement. They totally blew us off. DO NOT support Cyberhome in any way. VERY BAD!!!!!"
4,No for children,Este reproductor es bueno el unico problema es la resolucion de la pantalla por lo demas es una buena opcion considerando las caracteristicas que tiene.Por eso digo que este reproductor solo es para los que saben cuidar las cosas yo tengo 3 meses sin nigun problema.En cuanto a la bateria se debe tener cuidado de no dejarla en el aparato ya que se descarga eso es todo.
1,Beware,I bought this unit 3 days ago and sorry I did. it seems that it has a battery problem. I came home and charged the battery for 4 hours everything looked good. I watched a part of a movie and then put it away removing the battery as requested so i came back today and put the battery back in and turned it on and nothing I thought well maybe the battery just needs a charge. wrong again it seems there have been a few things written about this. At this point i have emailed them hoping they have a fix for this. I will update you.
3,Not bad for the cost,"Got it, wash it, using it.. not bad. Didn't fade and pretty soft for the price I got."
3,Somehow Dissatisfying,"An important study by the foremost scholar of the war in TENN and KY, and respected scholar in all areas of Civil War research; I was looking foreward to reading this, but had trouble .The writing seems oddly disjointed. Whille not a topical study, the narrative bounces around between viewpoints and subjects making it hard to follow. This isn't as good as the author's book on Ft.Donelson, to which this work is a sequel."
4,A quick read,I was going on a road trip and got this for my Kindle. It didn't have the ability to read to me so that was a bum plan. Once there I was able to read and it was yet another easy fun read from Jude Deveraux.
2,1st time disappointment,I have read just about all of Jude Deveraux's books and I have to say that this is the only one that left me wanting. It was slow to start. I thought the story line was really good and the characters were likable but it lacked something......... I think it was the chemistry. You were wondering for more than 1/2 the book WHO the male lead was. Then at the end you're left with NO WAY a Montgomery. I was disappointed but I will keep looking for her books because I like her characters especially the Montgomeries.
3,Don't waste your money on a 3 pack,"We can only use 1 out of the 3 of these baskets: the large basket. We can't figure out what the other baskets are for exactly and have used them for a month. We didn't get any instructions as to the intended use for the baskets. All we can figure out that the purpose of the bottom part of the medium basket is for nipples. However, the nipples (Playtex Drop-Ins silicone slow flow) are too large of a diameter to fit although they appear to be a standard size from what I have seen in stores. So, we have to put nipples in the bottom of the large basket in a single row leaving a lot of wasted space in the basket. The rest of our baby feeding equipment (Bottles, rings, etc.) stays put in the dishwasher. I encourage a reader to not pay extra for a 3 pack and instead just buy a single dishwasher basket. Also, for the price, I expected better quality plastic and latches. It does not appear that it will last much longer with daily use."
4,Dishwasher Baskets with Options,"We purchased this basket because the one we had with my first child finally bit the dust, but was never quite exaxtly what I needed. This comes as a combo set of 3 baskets which have suggested uses, but what I really like is that of all of the dishwasher baskets I looked at, I had trouble finding a basket that accomodated everything (breastpump parts, bottle accessories, sippy cups, etc). While these baskets aren't perfect, they offer a lot of versitility. I can fit Breastflow bottle parts and pumping accessories in these without any trouble. Most of the previous baskets I've encountered only fit standard sized bottle parts or parts from specific brands.The only feature I wish is contained was a better place to store the straws from the Take and Toss style cups. These are thin enought that they can fall through the holes unless you have other items in the basket."
1,Not Very Helpful,"I thought that this would be really helpful when it comes to making sure that I have clean nipples for my baby. Unfortunately, when you read the instructions for most latex nipples, they aren't dishwasher safe, and you are instructed to hand wash. So, having a dishwasher container for nipples is pretty useless. I use mine as a container that I can airdry my handwashed nipples in. Don't waste your money."
5,Safely out of sight,"Replaced my big countertop knife block with this. Three long and 4 short knives now safely in the drawer, easy to retrieve and replace- just what I wanted. It works!"
3,"I like it, but ...",Nice for organization if you have a small knife set ... only room for 3 large knives
5,Good place to keep my knives,"I purchased new knives and after purchased, noticed I didn't have anywhere to keep them safely without cutting my hand. I ordered these knives knowing they didn't come in a block which I heard was not a good idea since a block is a place for germs to build up,So I looked on Amazon website . for anything to be able to keep the knives and my hands safe. In searching I found this product which fits in a drawer and is a great place to keep the knives. It solved my problem and by the way, can be easily cleaned"
4,Very romantic,"I have almost every single book Linda has every wriiten. This was in her top 10. Her heroine was a bit confused about the hero, didn't want to get involved but did anyway. Still the time flew and I loved it."
5,Terrific book for young art lovers,"This is a great book that lets young children experience museum visit without leaving their house. Moreover, all the works in the book are true masterpieces of famous artists (the last book tells adults what is what). I had so many fun conversations with my 4 year old about this book - she loves it!"
5,M Lami,"Very good reference to cover and learn the subject of tensors. The best book I found for my master of engineering program on this subject.It provides what a student needs to learn. It is one of the few mathematical text books that are free of the common problem of extended useless work that disturbs the reader and undermines the delivery of information. This book is right to the point.However, strangely it misses the separation of the different notions, it is written in a continuous style without an order of classification."
4,Pigs like it,"This house works great. However, their favorite house is a piece off a Palm tree that I found. I'm sure a cardboard box would work as well also."
3,Incomplete,"Book itself is very informative, however there is a problem with representation of it being passed off as ""new"". First copy came without a dust jacket, hard cover had corner bumps and scuffs. Replacement copy came the exact same way, in the same condition and without the DJ. Cost of book is $50.00 NEW, had we wanted the book in used condition without the original DJ, we would have ordered it as such. The minimal refund Amazon offered was not to our satisfaction and the reps and/or management are too busy to make personal contact with their business customers. There appears to be an internal problem with receiving/quality inspection of their supplier's goods."
4,"Columnist's first novel a worthy effort, says wannabe critic armed with cliche phrases galore.","It's kind of fun reading a novel writted by a guy whose blog you've been reading for years and years. Because you feel you know the author personally, and when he writes a novel in first person, you keep thinking as you read: oh, James, you're SO not this guy! Which he is well aware of, I'm sure. Or, maybe he is, and the blogger persona is the big put-on. Anyway, this and GRAVEYARD SPECIAL (MILL CITY) are perfect Kindle books: breezy, engaging, and just plain fun. Buy it, read it, go explore at his awesome website: lileks.com. Then decide for yourself who the REAL James Lileks is."
5,Buy it now!,"In short, a top notch album. Great covers of some old standards as well as quality new fare. If the world ends in a month you will regret not having listened to this CD."
3,Worth listening to it once...,"It was pretty good, except that I really think it is best to just rent it from library..."
2,Nutritious but barely edible,These are good in terms of protein and fiber. They are horrid in terms of taste--coated with a sickly sweet icing and excessively flavored.
2,Not as original I had before,"I can only say that this is not as I was hoping to be. I have been using Tempore around 10 years ago and now I just wanted to refresh my memories and have it again. This one is a bit more I guess stuffed with alcohol rather than quality and it quickly vanishes, also the aroma is not quite the same. Between 1 and 10, I would go with 4 maybe."
3,Pretty Good,I've been catching movies on BET late night and for the most part they are pretty good. This one was watchable and had a few good laughs....I love Kevin Hart I think he is so funny and in this movie he lives up to it lol Overall it not great but not horrible either.
3,silly movie,"it's not in my top 50 or anything like that, but it's watchable and a little on the silly side."
1,garbage,"i brought this movie thinking that since Kevin Hart was in it that it might be pretty funny and Kevin Hart was, Kevin Hart did a good job, but i also bought it for stacy dash thinkin that she was on cover and that she might have a huge role but she didnt at all, she was jus the girl kevin couldn't get wit like 3 times she didnt even say more then 100 words...the movie itself seemed so fake...even the fight scenes looked fake...no plot what so ever...complete garbage...only way to describe it"
4,This movie had me cryin from laughter!!!!!,From the moment I hit the play button on my dvd player I was cracking up. This movie is so funny. I borrowed this movie from a friend then went out and bought my own copy after watching it so I can watch it over & over again.
4,Whoa,Kevin Hart is beyond hilarious in this movie!!!! And Memphis Bleek flow is hella funny too. One of my favorites with the exception of Friday. Highly recommended!!!
1,Disappointed,"When I purchased this dvd, I thought this would be a good show for me and my grown daughter to watch. We only watch 5mins of this show and in the trash it went. It's just not my preference. The product details on Amazon, does say this dvd is unrated. But, here is what it doesn't say, ""contains brief nudity, strong language and adult situations and recommended for age 17+"", which is on the back on the dvd."
4,sista's in the city,this was certainly for adults only. the storyline were delivered well. very short stories though. i will keep this in my collection.
2,"IM NOT HATING , BUT THIS MOVIE AINT ALL THAT!!!!!!!!","I BROUGHT THIS DVD, BECAUSE IM A HUGE FAN OF SEX IN THE CITY. SO WHEN I SAW THEY HAD A CARTOON VERSION WITH BLACK SISTAS I WANTED TO CHECK IT OUT. I READ THE OTHER REVIEWS AND SINCE PEOPLE SAID IT WAS GOOD, I BROUGHT IT. BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED. THIS DVD SUCKS BECAUSE FIRST THING,ITS DONE IN EPISODES THAT ARE LIKE 5-7 MINUTES LONG. AND ONCE YOU START GETTING INTO AN EPISODE IT ENDS AND THEN THE ANNOYING SONG ""DONT HATE ME CUZ IM ALL THAT"" COMES ON. ITS OKAY AFTER THE FIRST COUPLES OF EPISODES, BUT AFTER A WHILE ITS LIKE GIVE ME A BREAK! IT ALSO SUCK BECAUSE JUST WHEN YOU START TO GET INTO THE DVD IT ENDS!!!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMENED THIS DVD. IF YOU CAN CATCH THE EPISODES FOR FREE THEN HEY, BUT IF NOT SAVE YO MONEY!"
3,Muy bueno esteticamente hablando,"compré el ke970 más que nada por su apariencia, es muy elegante y cómodo, se siente fuerte (por ser de aluminio)sin ser demasiado pesado, al encenderlo me doy cuenta que es igual, elegante y fácil de usar, hasta donde lo he utilizado tiene buena recepción de señal, las fotos son bonitas pero la cámara es algo lenta para tomarlas...lo que no me gusta, es no poder personalizar todo, si acaso cambiar el fondo (y no he podido utilizar archivos flash, solo los determinados) con algunas imagenes, no me ha permitido utilizar los gifs que he encontrado en la webbueno, si les gusta el celular tal como viene de fábrica, está bien, pero si lo quieren personalizar... está muy dificil"
2,"Simple, very very simple..","This phone has a high point that is the style, full metal body and LCD mirror screen make it kind of attractive but it would be all. In the other hand this phone is very simple, does not have to do list, the calendar is really hard to use, the scroll bar is not good at all and has no precision. The signal is not strong and it is ""finger prints addict"" and gets scratches with anything. You can not send a message for more than 5 contacts at the same time. The camera has a really poor zoom and not good quality. The battery life really sucks!!! I have to charge it every day and it takes too long to be charged. USB CABLE NOT INCLUDED and really hard to find. If you want this phone just to talk and you dont send lots of messages it would be ideal for you in functionality and price. I had it for 5 months and changed for a Nokia."
2,Very high expectations and was very dissappointed,"This book was horrible for what I expected. Almost an entire chapter was dedicated to calculating BA, OBP, and SLG. Come on!The author felt the need to spend an entire chapter on his mind-numbing strategy for betting on baseball games. Bet when you think the true odds on a team are less than the actual odds. Wow, that's ground breaking stuff! Also, bet against the teams that have a large following and you will get better odds. Ya think?"
3,useful,"As a writer I am certainly interested in making my work more clear, concise and correct. Edit Yourself is a useful resource. It's not fun reading. There's no style or humor in this grammar guide whatsoevr but if all you want is a list of rules this book will do it for you."
1,BAD DEAL even at $,"This knife set and block is not what you are looking for. The block is a cheap piece of wood that still has splinters on it. The knifes are all cheap, dull, and not a quality that $100+ knifes should have.In this case you are really getting knifes that are worth the discounted price. Good thing shipping was free for me!"
2,A bad choice!,"Well everyone has made a bad choice. I made mine when purchased this item over a year ago here on amazon and paid $19.99 for it. At the time thought it was a good deal after reading the reviews.The shear was pretty good. The steak knives are sharp. The rest, however, is dull. If you are single and don't cook much and have a limited budget, then this set might be for you. But I cook daily, and it's just frustrating to cut my meat and vegetables with these knives. You also have to wash them right after you use them otherwise they'll rust. I forgot to wash mine right after I cut out some fruits, and there appears some rust spots in the morning.Anyway, I would not recommend these knives to those who cook daily. Save your money and get a better set."
1,Very Disappointed,I bought these knives expecting them to be the French made Sabatier knives. I was very disappointed with the quality of the knives (made in China). Another reason to go to the store in the future.
2,Cheap knives made in China,"The price was good, I was looking for an inexpensive set of knives to replace my garage sale assortment I had.For some reason, I was expecting the $15 set of 11 knives, a sharpening steel, scissors, and a knifeblock to be from France, due to the name.They are obviously not the same quality as a similar $100 set would be. The included knives don't even fill all the slots in the included block. They also aren't arranged in the block very well, which makes it awkward to access them sometimes.They do cut things okay, at least for now. I expect them to last me at least a year, before I shell out the cash for some better ones."
1,WOW--very overrated item! (negative 5 stars!),I was really excited to receive this item as I thought I was saving a great deal of money only to find out that these knives were CHEAP to say the least. Poorly made! The handles were a die-cast plastic and the metal knife itself was about as dependable as something you would find at the checkout clearance aisle. They are terrible! Do not buy this!
3,there are no free lunches....,"I agree with many of the reviews. You can buy one of the steak knives at the dollar store for a dollar. So, you have a dollar per piece... not a bad deal. Heck, use them until they die and then use the box for other knives. One lady explained it very good. Whenever something is a SET... they always count the container as one piece. The photo is deceiving though, b/c they moved one of the top knives down a row. There are 13 knives and 1 block = 14 pieces. Not worth returning, not that impressed... but not too disappointing. I've seen worse. Anything made in China is of this quality (kitchen products).No use crying over a cheap set of knives. ; )"
4,Great Value,"I am quite pleased with these knives. They are appropriate for home cooking--and at this price, they can't be beat!"
1,Defective,I purchased this set and after 35 days several of the knives have begun to rust along the top.
3,you get what you pay for.,"This product is worth what you pay for it but not much more. The knives are thick and not very sharp. But the steak knives are serrated and work well, the scissors are very handy and the wood block is nice. All in all worth the $14 you pay for it."
4,"Great, inexpensive knives","I got these knives for my parents for their Anniversary last year and was suprised by the quality of these things. I was kind of hesitent buying a whole knife set so cheap, but it has turned out to be an excellent investment. We've had the knives for almost a year now and they are just as sharp as ever, and we use them multiple times per day.If you are looking for a great knife set on a budget, seriously consider getting these knives. I have reccomended them multiple times for friends that have recently gotten apartments and it's a great way to start out your kitchen on a budget."
1,How can I rate it if one piece seems to be missing?,"I think the item will be good when it is complete. I did get 14 pieces (counting the wooden block), but there is an empty slot in the block, which, I suppose, would be the place for another knife. Or not? In case it is to be like I received it, what is the empty slot for? Until I get an explanation, I'll rate the item a 2.Your comments will be appreciated."
2,Missing Pieces,"I ordered two sets of these knives...both sets have missing pieces. The 5.5"" utility knife is not included in the box. There is no way to rectify this because none of the options on the website pertain to this situation."
1,they would not cut,"I am by no means a gourmet chef. I don't even know what half of the knives are made for. However, I do know when a knife cuts and these knives were very difficult to cut through the simplest things like green peppers and carrots. I believe the saying ""you get what you pay for"" applies to these knives."
5,Fun Parent/Tot Activity. Rewarding for both of us!,"This collection is great for early readers. My son loves these mini-books. I just need to open it up and he'll pick one w/ words or pictures that catch his eye and we'll make it.It's a nice way to spend some fun learning time together - he likes to cut, help staple & fold, then read the book - all at his pace. He doesn't write yet, but we do the last part- fill in the missing letter page, verbally. We both get a nice sense of accomplishment!"
4,"Haunting, pulse pounding music.",An erie assortment of sounds. Drum beats coupled with sound clips. As haunting as the movie that inspired it.
2,"Just, okay...",This book has some good recipes once you get through all the other text. I love a good working cookbook rather than a history lesson..
3,"Some interesting tidbits, BUT. . . .","The authors' conclusions make sense overall and shed an interesting light on a little-studied group of people. However, the prose could use a great deal of trimming and reworking, and gets worse as you proceed through the book. By the end, it becomes very distracting.A few of the conclusions are also questionable. For example, the authors claim that atheists are more dogmatic than one might expect, but their own evidence shows that atheists are substantially less dogmatic than most other religious groups. Their assertion about the dogmatism of atheists is on dodgy ground, and seems to have more to do with adding drama to the research findings than with those findings themselves.Aside from these points, a good introductory foray into an important topic of research."
3,DECENT FOR THE PRICE,"I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS REVIEW IN THAT THE QUALITY IS NOT GREAT. HOWEVER, MY SON THINKS THAT THEY ARE THE CAT'S MEOW! COULD NOT FIND THEM ANYWHERE ELSE AND MY SON HAD TO HAVE THEM. I LIKE THE PRINT."
2,idk why i got it,my son does not like this toy at all the music is not what he like so he goes for my ipod to get his songs
4,"Follow the instructions, and it's fine!","I've had my remote for two months now, and I'm completely satisfied. Yes, it's big and bulky, yes the manual is huge, and yes, it's a little complicated to set up but if you READ the instructions and follow the steps carefully you'll have very few if any problems. I found that by setting up one remote at a time ( I have 4 currently ) and testing each result that the process goes fairly smoothly. Even my wife who is definitely not a techie loves it, and that in itself vindicates the cost."
1,It sucks.,"Backlight is terrible. Really hard to read at night, much less during the day.I paid only about $50.00 and still felt ripped off."
4,A good book!,i bought the dictionary and i found it very useful and good.It help me a lot during my stay in Switzerland. i highly recommended it to everyone who want to master german faster. IT is a complete and useful guide for you to learn German. Trust me! i can speak good german and good writing too now. The book helps me a lot!
3,"Nice exterior, flawed interior, cheap sole","This is a nice looking shoe. The leather shine lasts well and looks good. Inside the shoe, the lining has already started curling up after only a few weeks of wear. The sole is made of cheap rubber/plastic materials. But it is too early to say how long the sole will last."
5,A great beach read,"I picked up this book to take on vacation with me and finished most of it on the plane trip down and the first night in my hotel. It is witty, sentimental and just plain funny at the same time. It is a great coming of age story for 5 friends who work together in improv theatre. I love chick-lit and Theresa Alan is another author I will read."
5,Perfect workout!,It's an excellent workout and only 20 minutes! It really makes you sweat and you move every part of the body.
3,"Good show, fans in the ""fans rule"" need to get a job","(...). I tend to look at this for the entertainment value. Sure, the guys in the band look tired and old...and maybe they sound like it..but I give them props for keeping to their original format and doing it again and again. The one thing I admire about this band is their passion for their craft. The fans rule section is nothing more than a bunch of retards who bitch about life from the comfort of their parents' house. I could have done without it. Slayer is a great band...but common....it's ENTERTAINMENT...you don't have to take it literally..."
5,Slaytanic Live Insanity!!!,"I have seen SLAYER 4 times in concert, so far. They are by far the best LIVE Metal band period. Better then Gwar or Pantera put together. This DVD was fillemed on the ""GOD HATES US ALL TOUR 01-02"" I saw them on this tour in August w/ SoulFly. It was hella crazy. The opening scene w/ the black lites and blood soaked speakers will blow u away. If your new to SLAYER also pic up; South Of Heaven, Reign In Blood, Divine Intervention, Hell Awaits, & Undiputed Attitude. SLAYER 4 EVER !!!"
3,ummmmmmmmmm,"ok. i will watch the rest of the dvd tomorrow (i got the Chris Jericho dvd today) and seriously....WHERE ARE THE CYMBALS IN THIS RECORDING????????????!!!!!! anyways, Tom's voice and bass playing is awesome and Kerry's and Jeff's playing is awesome!!!....however all i hear is Paul's snare and double bass drumming. WHERE ARE THE CYMBALS????!!! i tried hooking up all 4 speakers, 5.1 , stereo, mono, everything and nothing but the snare and double bass???!!! regardless, ill watch the whole concert tomorrow...."
1,Great stuff but bad quality,Looks like Amazon is selling old stuff. Kashi makes great Bars but just don't buy them from Amazon
3,okay...,"I have found some kashi products to be really good and other to be just average. Well, these are just average. I was hoping they'd be far more, but like with a lot of kashi products, the best part is the advertising. Sorry, these just aren't as good as they sound..."
1,Don't waste your time,"Smith starts his ""review"" of Christianity with a strong bias toward modern relativistic liberalism. His book is nothing more than a statement of his faith that Jesus supported abortion, homosexuality, and a rejection of moral absolutes. Smith supposes that because Jesus didn't seemingly speak directly to the issues of abortion and homosexuality, he must be in favor of them both. A certainly preposterous assumption. Contrary to Smith, I have actually read the Bible, and I can testify that Smith has no idea what he's writing about. Don't waste your time reading his trash."
3,Smaller than advertised,"I just received this Sherpa pet carrier for an upcoming flight. Although it is well designed and built, it is much smaller than advertised. The dimensions that are listed are the exterior dimensions and not the interior dimensions. The problem is that the wheels that from underneath and pad inside of the carrier take up 2.5 inches of room. And the exterior length is an inch shorter than listed. Not bad if your pet is smaller than those measurements, but important to consider when buying. I am going to opt for a carry model by sherpa instead of the wheeled version. The larger wheeled version is pushing the limits of the recommended size by the airlines (and is not in stock anyhow). Well built, nice looking and an instant hit for my pooch, but just to confining for her size. My Papillion is 11' high and under 9 pounds with a length of 16"". I measured 17"" long x 11"" wide by 8"" tall on the interior.Sherpa On-Wheels Pet Carrier - Medium"
1,"Half the price, less than half the quality","They came at a price that I couldn't refuse and I got less than my money's worth. The ink bleeds into the paper, and smears as the paper comes out of the printer. My kids couldn't use the printer for homework assignments until I replaced the Amazon cartridge. I ordered 2, so I threw one out unopened. I had to spend the money (again) and buy Epson cartridges. I'll stick with Epson from now on."
5,Just great!,Very well written self-help book. The best in the market. Although it has scientific component and it might be difficult to understand for some readers. I would recommend it to everyone. Shipment perfectly on time.
5,Inspirational,"Somebody recently introduced me to this video, knowing that I had some interest in the field. They said it is something you need to watch over a few times to fully take in, what it is he is explaining. I cannot agree more. Even though his interpretation is very easy to follow, there is just so much information that it is impossible to grasp all at once. I felt the hour flew by effortlessly, and I was left with a much higher understanding of the most basic things in life. I cannot say whether you would need to have some prior knowledge of the Chakras to help you follow his lecture, but I feel interest would be enough. He mixes old and new humourously together. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will definately be buying it."
4,Who cares if it's not an hp item?,"Does it really matter if it is or isn't an hp item? It's cheap and the quality is just as good. ITS AN EXCELLENT PRICE. I do agree though, it was wrong for this refilled item to pop up in the HP section, but it's obviously not an hp original product so why does anyone care. If you actually read any of the description you would see before buying it that it's not an original! IT'S YOUR FAULT THAT YOU WERE FOOLED, NOT AMAZON'S!!!"
3,"Great Price, they look like the antique real ones, performance not great","You get what you pay for the price, they look great but are cheaply built and always giving problems as they get stuck. I have about 8 of this brand and 6 of another brand these work about 75% of the time right until they jam and you basically have to bring a screwdriver and do some work to fix them.I gave them 3 stars as they really look great and the price is great."
4,Remote,"I have found that this remote does everything it is advertised to do. The screen is a touch-screen monochrome LCD which is a little difficult to read, but very easy to use. Setting up the functionality is not easy and can be quite time consuming, but when completed it works! I wish it had a computer interface or something like that to simplify the programming process. It is a very good remote for the money."
4,"Great travel advice, as usual for Lonely Planet","I bought this book to prepare for my trip to Nepal. I found the advice in the book regarding cultural mores and appropriate behavior to be invaluable. The descriptions of places, restaurants, and hotels was accurate. I would have liked to see longer lists of accommodations. One thing I learned in Nepal is there are many, many more hotels than this book describes.Here's why I gave it a 4: if you are over 40, go out and buy reading glasses before purchasing this book. The font size is very small and difficult to read for those of us with older eyes, especially in the dim light of an airplane or a Nepal Hotel Room."
1,This is wrong!,James Rosin's documentary on the birth of baseball in the City of Brotherly Love. - This is incorrect! Baseball was born in Philadelphia in 1883 with the Phillies. A's came in 1901.
5,Cloud Taxonomy,"As a teaching scientist my students and I daily observe and report clouds as part of the international GLOBE program and local meteorology. It is not enough to know the 10 basic cloud types. This provides the detailed language, history and evolution of our systematic understanding of clouds, wind and atmospheric phenomenah - not found in meteorology, climatology or geography texts and encyclopedia - and provides a foundation of systematic understanding across many disciplines and many countries over 350+ years. A good read that stays in the mind."
4,excellent to know Bangladesh,"If you are an expatriate bengali and want your friends know about Bangladesh then this is THE book. It contains excellent photographs from different walks of life with brief annotations. Various bengali aspects that relates to the day-to-day bengali life is honestly portrayed. However the urban life, for example the life of a Dhakaite or the downtown Dhaka or the life in a township is not reflected fully. Also only one archeological site got the highlight. But anyway the photographs are worth looking at and its worth buying."
3,A nice introduction,"Made in EU in 2000, Serial# 544-325-2, Playing Time 78:34This compilation lifts tracks from their first 6 albums, up to and including T.R.A.S.H. (Tubes Rarities And Smash Hits).It provides a good retrospective into their A&M discography, the pinnacle of their theatre-rock era, often with a good dose of humorous lyrics (like on ""I Was A Punk Before You Were A Punk"".)The track selection is judicious: the true fan needn't bother, but out of the single-compilations out there, which typically cover the Capitol discography, this one's a good investment for someone interested in having the earlier side of their career.""Don't Touch Me There"" is a classic. More affordable but not as comprehensive as the 2-disc set ""Goin' Down""."
1,Never me again,"I bought these PylePro series speakers new and could not use them as the box itself rattles and mixes with the sound or music, very very annoying. The box itself is made of something like hard cardboard and there seems to be no quality control in the way the box was put together. All the materials used in its construction are substandard; could not imagine from pictures it could have been like this."
1,Worst Yoga video ever made,"The sad part is that Ms. Roberts has plenty of information to offer, but she fails to follow her own instructions. This video would get 3 stars if it were offered to yoga instructors for teaching golfers, but as an instructional video for golfers, it is nearly worthless."
3,Light on LightScribe,I was disappointed in the number and value of the LightScribe backgrounds offered by this program.
2,Galil Blackberry Tea,Don't like the taste. Didn't realize it was Herbal. Definately would not purchase this product again. Don't know what to do with what I have left.
4,Another from Mr. Zellar,"For those that have been a fan of Martin Zellar's before the Gear Daddies break-up and beyond, this album will not disappoint. It is also a great starting point for newbies.Zellar does not stray far from what has worked in the past, yet many of the tracks are refreshing. I have spent a-many long Minnesotan summer nights by the campfire with MZ & GD albums playing in the background.This is just another chapter in a near-legendary career. File with artists such as Wilco, Jayhawks, Peacemakers, Pistoleros, Golden Smog..."
4,Fun car,"I bought this car sort of as a joke for my daughter who turned 16, since I was not going to buy her a real car, but she actually has fun with this! It's entertaining to send it tootling around the house, and also to intrigue the cat and dog. It is not particularly fast-moving, which would be good for a younger child, someone who is just learning to maneuver a remote, or even for some of us older folks who don't really care about speed anymore."
1,Broke in 5 minutes,"This toy was a waste of money. It advertises that it can go in water, which my boy was very excited about. It broke in 5 minutes."
4,Great remote control car for the 5-10 year old crowd,"I bought this for my son for Christmas in 2009 when he was five and he loved it. It is very sturdy and can go in water and over decently bumpy terrain. The remote control was easy for him to figure out. The headlights on the car light up. It's not too loud. Even over a year later and he is 6, he still loves this toy. Occasionally he is allowed to bring electronic toys to his summer camp and he always picks this toy, it is definitely one of his favorites. Its battery life is decent, although of course I wished they lasted longer, but they last reasonably long. I would highly recommend these Morphibian cars (though besides the fin on the top it doesn't look all the shark like)."
2,Won't last,"When it works, this toy is fun. Unfortunately, it is not durable. My five year old got it for Christmas and loved it, but within three months of moderate use (didn't use all that frequently - maybe two or three times a week), it wouldn't work. Really disappointing."
5,possibly the best,"never had a replica genral lee like this one before very nice ver detailedi highly recomend it for any one who has followed the dukes from day ""01""to purchase this and you will not regret it!!!"
5,Son loves it,Great utility travel board. Nothing fancy just for playing chess. Easy to get out and store. Very mobile. Exactly what I was looking for. This has and will get a lot of use. Very pleased.
4,Very enjoyable,Any book by Heather Graham catches my eye and I thought I would give this one a try and was quickly taken in by the story. It was just a nice read. I loved stories about past loves reuniting and this book just made me smile.
3,"Not bad, but a significant quality diff from the Manfrotto","Decent clamp, but when my $expensive$ gear is on the line, i think i'll stick with Manfrotto for a few dollars more.I do notice a difference in the build quality, the finish (black paint, you can see the overspray) and the cam-action of the clamping screw- not nearly as smooth as the Manfrotto.Another note which i think is key- the (un)""grippy"" material used in the clamp jaws and the flat insert is NOT really that grippy. It's more of a hard, slick plastic. which is not very cool for something that needs to have GRAB. i feel much more confident with the spongy rubber stuff that Manfrotto uses."
5,Oistrakh,"These performances are Oistrakh at the hight of his facility and technical command. His playing is so solid and strong. His intonation is perfect, and the ensemble playing, especially with his favorite accompinist, Lev Oberin, is intimately together. His Kruetzer sonata with Oberin is the best recording I have ever heard out of Heifitz, Milstein and Szerying. These recordings are essential for the violin lover. He is truly one of the greatest violinists of the century."
3,"No visible effect so far, greasy","Seems like it should work esp with the strong reviews. I've been using it since I received it a few weeks ago and haven't noticed any difference as of yet. My fine lines are still there. The cream, which could just extremely moisturizing, is a bit on the greasy side. Will keep using to see what the effect is after a longer period of time."
1,"Music goooood, quality dismal",One of my absolute favorites from the 70s (actually of ever) and I couldn't wait to hear it again and transfer to my ipod.But the static is so prominent it's painful to listen. The only time it's bearable is at the gym where the ambient noise covers up the defects. Might also be acceptable through the car stereo but I haven't tried yet.Wish I could recommend it but I have to say absolutely don't buy it.
2,"Worked great for a little, and then it died","This showerhead was great at first, then after about 6 months, the pressure suddenly dropped and it doesn't work nearly as well anymore. I've been forced to take baths and I'll have to purchase a new showerhead. My water pressure through my house, and in the shower (out of the tub spout) is still strong and fine. I'm very disappointed in it."
4,Great shower head,"This shower head makes it feel like you have more water pressure even when you don't...It mixes air with the water through a venturi to produce this effect, increasing the pressure you feel. It is a little loud, but I think the other reviews overstated that fact. We bought this for the second bathroom, but it has moved into the master bath."
4,Jet-like!,"I installed one of these last week, and performance-wise, its definately an upgrade over the showerhead I replaced. Although I don't have a problem with water pressure in my home, the pressure of this unit is excellent, and the added attribute of water savings is a definite plus.The spray from the unit feels fantastic, and makes rinsing off go more quickly. However, I have been wondering, does anyone else using this model think its a little loud? The promo touts the shower as a place of peace and quiet... actually at times it resembles showering with a 737. Maybe its just me?"
5,Powerful showerhead,"This showerhead is the best one I have ever owned. It has a powerful and full spray. It supposedly uses less water but you wouldn't know it. It has a solid feel, no cheap plastic. It is a blast!"
3,Not as good as the Spa 2000,"Just OK performance with none of the pizzazz of my older shower heads. After 20 years, one of my SPA 2000 shower heads called it quits. After trying the original shower head (the one that came with the condo) and seeing the water turn cold I decided to get another shower head. SPA 2000 company is apparently out of business so we hoped the Oxigenics would be ""just as good"" but it is not. We loved SPA 2000 product and I hope my other one lasts forever."
2,it needs a new design,"There are four problems with this showerhead.First, the hole in the section of the showerhead that receives the flange and lets water through is too small, much smaller than a standard showerhead. This creates the problem of having greater water pressure backing up and leaking unless tightened more than normally required.Second, the shower coming from the head is a bit too fine and misty.Third, to take a shower under this showerhead, you must get right close to it. At a distance, the water becomes much colder and mistier than being next to the showerhead.Finally, it covers only a rather small area. Even for rinsing shampoo out of your hair, you must shift head around more than usual.The showerhead could benefit from a better design.I gave it two stars instead of one because the customer service was friendly and helpful for solving a leak problem."
1,It has no pressure,"Brand new bathroom and plumbing with very high water pressure, and what came out of this thing was warm, but not as described. wrong kind of shower..."
4,Great for the price,"I actually used this first while at a hotel during a business trip. I thought the lower pressure I have at home would be helped using this showerhead so i bought this one. I have to say, it works great. The pressure is great and can be adjusted to your individual taste with the side handle. The only thing that I viewed as ""not perfect"" was the sound. As stated by other reviewers, this system injects air into the stream of water and that must be why it sounds so loud. However, based upon the reasonable price, I think it is great."
5,"Watch out for the size, but a very well made shoe","I am a size 9.5 and I wear a size 11 perfectly. It should be snug, but you need to be able to get your foot in. So buy one to two sizes up from your normal shoe size. Other than that it was very comfortable, didn't dirty quickly and have yet to wear out (four months and many ballet classes later)."
4,Plank Grilling Cookbook,"This book arrived in good condition and quickly. This is a gift, but the recipes look interesting and seems to have some good hints in it as to cooking with cedar planks."
5,My favorite for over 20 years...,"...bar none. And that includes The Mountain Astrologer. I'm a semi-pro and what I like best about this magazine is its appeal to all levels of astrological learning on FUN, practical and timely topics (Sun Sag/ASC Cap) written by knowledgable and well respected professionals. But with the skyrocketing costs of a physical subscription, I've had to switch over to having it delivered to my Kindle. For those of you considering this option, I must advise you that some of the important features at the back of the magazine are missing, like the monthly ephemeris, the daily aspect guide, etc. This is not a problem if, like me, you have an emphemeris or professional software. I still miss it, though...but am lucky to find the time to read each issue. The magazine also contains articles in varying lengths from quite lengthy to one page. My preference lies in between, but there is surely something for everyone. Enjoy!"
3,"A bit dated, but still good. not great, but not bad.","Plot you can pick up from other reviewers.This is a great example of late 60's, early 70's SciFi. The story is fair enough, but facts, names, events, etc. fly by you a bit too quickly for my tastes. A bit too ""... and then we blew up their planet, and THEN....""I found myself wanting to know the characters more, give me a reason to want them to win, but it lacked depth when it came to personalities, high on technical crap.It's dated in how it refers to technology; 'tape' on computers, lack of cell phone type communication, assumption of large sizes needed for computers... maybe its intended but i kept getting distracted by the terminology. I'm glad there wasn't any steam-powered star cruisers.. lol.Still, it was good, and I recommend it as a low-cost book."
3,Sent back,"My kid's was missing the slate caller, so I sent it back. Sort of glad it was missing it as I was not impressed with the parts that arrived either."
1,Not Worth the Money!,"Love the suction power!However, the attachment tool is not that great.Plus the price is not attractive at all!Short-lived battery!Will not recommend this product to anyone!"
3,"Nice power and design, short battery","For what we bought this portable for, it's great. It cleans up cheerios and lint and crumbs quickly and easily. It's easily the best cordless I've tried, powerwise. I don't think we would have spent the money without a coupon (a bit overpriced, otherwise), but we've certainly used it a lot in the past few weeks! I do wish the battery lasted longer, but for quick pick-ups, this is perfect."
5,dyson,DYSON DC 6 HANDHELDGave it as a gift to my mother-in-law for her stairs &/or furniture. So far she is very pleased with the handheld dyson.
3,not the handvac for me,"I have 3 toddlers to clean up after all day. Cheerios, playdoh, flying food...you get the picture. After using the Root for a few weeks, I'm considering bringing my Dirt Devil back in from the garage. I love the suction and cool whirly riot you get as the dirt flies around. What I dislike is the weight of the vacuum, the size of it and the odd backing it into the charger; which you do quite often. Also, who wants to hold the switch 'on' the whole time while you are vacuuming. Would it have been so hard to make it on and off? And one more thing...the suction area is very small. I routinely get it jammed up with things that my Dirt Devil would eat for breakfast. Yes, it's sooooo cool, but try to stick it under a bed. Good luck."
3,"It works well, but a bit awkward for handling and battery dies out quickly","I purchased this handheld vacuum because I own an upright one for a few years now. As expected for a Dyson, it works well/powerful suction etc...but this one is a bit awkward to use compare to other handheld I used in the past. Also, the battery does not last very long, thus requiring recharing all the time."
2,"disappointed in this, love my other dyson vacuums","Dyson DC16 Root 6 Handheld Vacuum CleanerI own two upright dyson vacuums and love them, so I ordered the DC16 Root 6 handheld even though it was more expensive than many handheld vacuums. I have had it for a year and used it a lot, but I don't like it. Mine may be defective, but its suction is less than impressive. I was also disappointed with dyson's customer service when I complained about it. I bought a $29 dirt devil today. If I have problems with it, at least I won't regret spending a lot of money based on a brand name."
3,Not for Cat Fur,"I bought this unit to pick up the odd tufts of cat fur that blow around the premises. Unfortunately, cat fur tended to collect up at the top of the collection chamber and get stuck there. Even removing the chamber didn't dislodge it, so I had to use either a finger or a chopstick to dislodge the wads of fur. Since I am allergic to cat fur and wanted to be able to pick it up and dispose of it with minimum exposure, this wasn't satisfactory.Also, pulling the trigger to start the vacuum required a bit too much finger movement. A more sensitive switch would have been less fatiguing to use.Other than that I liked this unit. I kept it on the charger most of the time and since I was using it to clean up just a few trouble spots the battery life was more than good enough for me."
3,Love it but quality issues are concerning,"I've had my Root 6 for around 2 years (maybe a little longer) and the motor has failed twice in addition to the battery not holding a charge. Dyson customer service has been very good so far - they've sent replacement parts without any issues/questions. Since my warranty just expired or recently expired, customer service said any future warranty requests will not be free of charge. I'm sure the motor will fail again and it will cost $64 to get a new one from Dyson.Other than these quality issues, I do love it...and I hope they resolve these issues."
1,doesn't loose suction? oh it sucks alright,"We've had this vacuum less than a year now and the battery charge lasts about 1 minute. And you can't use it while it's plugged into the while, ie charging, so if you actually have a mess, forget it. The battery is junk."
3,must have for parents despite short battery life,"Yes, the battery life is barely long enough for a quick car cleaning. But because of how easy it is to empty and how well it sucks up our kids' mess this vacuum is a lifesaver. Before spilled cheerios or rice krispies were a big headache. Now we just grab the dyson off the kitchen wall, suck, and empty. Mission accomplished. The key factor is you don't have to touch the mess with your fingers. I purchased two black&decker pivot nose vacuums for my business at a third of the price but I hate using it. The nozzle and canister clog up frequently so that you get to use your fingers to fish out the mystery hair-garbage-dust ball. For a $150 handheld dyson, you expect the best which it is except for the poor battery life where it loses 2 stars."
5,Works like it is suspose to.,I read the reviews that are not so positive about this hand held. I also realize that it is not meant to do all your cleaning. It does a very good job at cleaning up small areas. I do the nooks and crannies while the wifes does the large areas with the floor model Dyson. I also let off the button inbetween spots so I have not run out of battery yet.Easy to clean out the canister and wipe it off/out.I fully recommend this unit....
2,I thought it was broken!,"3 hours of charge = 6 minutes of use.There you have it.I thought the friggen thing was broke, it died on me so fast.No doubt this hideously lopsided equation is just a reflection of how hard the Dyson Root 6 sucks. But I also think it's a reflection of how much the Dyson Root 6 sucks.If you have to vacuum your car out, and you discover to your surprise it's a motorcycle, then I suspect the battery life will be juuuuuust enough."
2,Dyson MISINFORMS,"6 minute run time! Nowhere does it ever say that - or that is inteded for ONLY quick pick-ups. Also, you have to hold the on botton to make it work. Hard on the hand. Come on Mr. Dyson. You hood-winked us on this one. The regular vacuum is hard to do steps by using the extension. It tips over - I thought this was the answer for all the jobs the big one can't do. I'd NEVER buy this one and have apologized to the person I gave it to as a gift."
1,VERY disappointing,"I've had this little Dyson for a few months now. The short battery life is not my complaint--I wasn't looking for something to use for long periods. I just wanted something for quick pickups.I've got a full size Dyson vacuum and love it. This little guy isn't worth the plastic that was killed making him.For me the suction is NOT there. I just tried to clean up a small amount of cat hair and there was next to NO suction whatsoever. I cleaned all three (yes, THREE) filters and I still have no suction. I've taken the whole thing apart and looked for blockages. Nothing. It sucks. No--I mean it WON'T suck. :)A few months ago it has SOME suction but not nearly as much as my ten-year-old Dustbuster which it replaced.I expected so much more."
1,So disappointed!!,"I love my large floor Dyson, so I thought that this would be great to keep on my basement stairs for quick clean-up of the steps and pet food. Well, it has to be very quick because the battery life is horrible. I could not believe that Dyson let me down. Luckily, my local retailer took it back (at a $50 hit to me)."
1,Had much higher expectations. No longer a Dyson fan.,"Purchased the handheld because I believed in the brand. That's not the case anymore. I think I've used it a total of 25x since I bought it. Works for 3-5 seconds at a time because the battery no longer holds a charge. Called 800 number. Warranty expired - and what makes it more infuriating is that I was gone on active duty for most of the warranty period. Only solution the representative could offer, after insisting I pay to change out the charger first, is sending me a new battery for $79 plus shipping. Why would I bother replacing the battery when it would cost me more than half of what I paid for the unit to begin with? Very disappointed in Dyson."
2,A merely adequate tool that could (and should) have been great...,"Many of the reviewers have already said it -- the newest wonder from Dyson just isn't that wonderful. The vac itself does a good job, but as a tool it's VERY cumbersome to handle... and the battery life is simply horrible. Dyson's other products are fantastic (I own several of them), but this one misses the mark. This is the first product I've seen from Dyson that seems to be overly-designed... a little too much style, and not nearly enough function. Very disappointing."
1,Doesn't Lose Suction--Doesn't Have It in the First Place,"We bought a Dyson upright years ago and are still very pleased with its performance. About a year ago, we bought the Dyson handheld for quick clean-ups. I was aware that most handheld vacs have notoriously short battery lives, but I wasn't expecting to use it for more than a few minutes at a time anyway. Unfortunately, the suction on this handheld is so powerless that it takes longer than a full battery-charge to clean up all but the tiniest of messes. It's a shame James Dyson traded on his reputation for quality and let such a shoddy product out onto the market. I just think things should work properly."
3,Consider the DeWalt for Power and Long Sucks,"I was about to buy this but after reading the reviews it sounds like Dyson sacrificed power and battery longevity for ""design."" I needed something for walking around the house and doing a good clean (ie, not just a 30 second clean-up). Ended up buying a DeWalt 18 volt, which I really like. And it looks cooler, too. This is what I bought: DEWALT DC515K Heavy Duty 1/2 Gallon 18-Volt Ni-Cad Cordless Wet/Dry Vac. Only complaint: this one is loud as heck!"
5,Wonderful World,This Iz CD is wonderful as are all of his CD's. Each has excellent music that is so relaxing that it must be better than medication for high blood pressure.
5,We listen to this CD every night!!!!!,"I happened upon this CD purely by chance in an effort to find calming music before bedtime. Every night after the stories are read and the lights are turned off, I put IZ on for the kids. They can't sleep without listening to this CD. The music is lovely and soothing. What a wonderful Artist he was! His legacy lives on in our house."
3,Big Bible,I found the Bible to be too Large I can barely pick up and hold the bible I wanted a large print but I had no ideal it would be so large. in the description it should explain how large it is. This is not a Bible that you would cary to Church.
1,yikes,"what disrespect the producer of this project shows to Iz, exploiting the man after his death and milking these songs for cash on another release, this time with badly engineered keyboard strings behind many previously released songs. listen close (or read about it in the 33 1/3 book) and you will hear (choke) auto-tune on Iz's vocals. talk about removing all the charm out of the original, wow! if you asked me I would say do not buy this CD."
1,Shame on de Mello!,"I understand the marketing side of wanting to expand IZ's presence (and get more dollars), but shame on de Mello for insulting Hawaiians and all that IZ stands for. The orchestra add-on was way overdone in my opinion... if you're into ""The Little Mermaid"" sound, then this is probably for you, but if you're looking for more of IZ's sweet voice and beautiful, clean sounds of ukulele, don't bother buying this CD. You'll be disappointed."
3,Kind of expensive for what it is but there are no other options,This is a pretty basic filter with a clear plastic lens for the hood light. It gets the job done and it's the only one that fits my vent.
3,Great for beginners or maybe those 14-16,"Great book on the basics it just lacks depth,I like her other books better as the problem with any overview is you can miss the details"
1,Where are the pictures?,"The book descrition seemed to be quite insteresting. Specially for someone like me, who is planning a trip to Venice by the end of this year. Unfortunely it was quite a disappointment to verify that none of the pictures present in the physical edition is shown in the Kindle version. Nevertheless it can be downloaded for free from the Kindle Store, it does not make sense to have just the text of this book. What a pitty...."
4,"Delivered as promised, luxuriously thick",You get what is advertised. This rug is thick & luxurious. It looks great next to my bed and my toes like the feel of it in the morning.
1,Don't buy this junk,"I successfully passed all five tests by reading Oracle's online books, and I would not recommend this book."
5,BEST ELEC. BASS BOOK EVER,"When I bought my first electric bass guitar I sorted through hundreds of instructional books, looking for the right one for me. When I finally asked some expirenced bassist' they all recommended this book. If you are looking for a easy-to-follow book with lots of practice tunes, and if you have little or no musical expirence then GET THIS BOOK NOW!"
5,Torrie Wilson is a knockout!,Bump this ppv get the dvd to see the hot action between Torrie and Dawn in the hotel.Youre imagination will go wild.And for the record im not a kid.
3,dungeon/outkast,"i got this album yesterday and when i started to listen to it it wasnt all that hot at first cause most times when u listen to a cd the first time its not that good. so iam still listning to it but i still think the df could have don better even the intro was better than most of the songs the best songs were the intro,trans df express,and on and on and on df i sugest that u spend more time on the songs than the intro to make the next df album better but in the end its still a good album to by if your a df fan./ big up jamaica"
3,Different .....one to grow on.,"I listened to the entire CD twice non-stop and was amazed by the innovative style of the Dungeon Fam. It's a good CD but the wild style funk I wasn't used to. I'm a fan of Outkast's ""Supacadillac"" and ""ATLiens"" so I couldn't really get into it. The songs I like the most were ""crooked booty"" and ""white guts"". If you like abstract dirty south then it for you."
4,This was shocking!!!!,"I went to the store to buy this album thinking it would be outstanding. I would have given this album a higher rating if Outkast and Goodie Mob were rookies, but this wasn't the album of the year! The best tracks are 6 minutes, Curtains, Trans Df Express, Crooked Booty, and White Guts. Overall, those are the best tracks. Props to DF for the album, but next time, they shouldn't add skits at the end of half the tracks, have so much singing,make some more unique beats, have so much talking, extend the number of songs, and have everybody on some tracks, even though there are 14 members, and have some rap critics come in to help these doggs along the way. Then, they'll get 5 stars from me 4 the next album."
3,Decent,"Even in Darkness is a decent album with a lot of artists on it. If I were you, I'd skip it and buy Outkast instead because there's not enough of them on this one. I reccomend this only to die hard fans."
2,Cheap For The Price,"I guess it's to be expected when it comes to most holiday products, but the material was VERY thin and cheap feeling. There wasn't much form or anything to the robe, and had we seen it in stores, we would not have purchased it. Did the job, but not recommended. Especially for the price!"
2,"Great series, disappointing quality","This is the most disappointing DVD box I've seen so far: the picture keeps on quivering and is rather unfocused. I own a lot of NTSC and Region 1 DVDs where the picture is fine, so my player can't be the reason. Lovely series, but very very poor quality DVDs. A shame for A&E. I'm very disappointed :-("
5,Dr. Quinn-Season 1,We as a family loved this show when it was on tv. Recieved other seasons for christmas and wanted to start at the begining. We have fallen in love again with the show and can't wait to see the rest of the seasons!
5,Dr. Quinn Medicine woman,"Dr. Quinn was a wonderful series. Authentic material, well researched and the actors were superb. I have them all and watch them over and over again during the winter months.Great for the whole family."
5,Best Angkor book,I have reviewed a few Angkor books. I think this is the best book among them. The pictures are very good.
5,Top Tunes Karaoke,"Hard to find Karaoke cd+g disc. Main feature was ""The Thunder Rolls with 3rd verse"" Only company to feature 3 rd verse. Now out of business."
1,Nightmare,"They make it sound so easy. It's not! The drill they give to for making the holes to refill is a joke. I wound up using an electric drill myself. After refilling, the cartridge no longer worked properly. I would not recommend this product. I had to throw out the cartridge AND the refill kit. I also questioned the company about leaving the holes open after refilling and was told that they would not leak ink. They leaked ink!"
2,Frustrated,I purchased the Power Sculpt dvd and received the wrong one. I returned it with a note to send me the correct one and instead they refunded me my money back so I never did get the DVD.
5,A Great Workout,"The Biggest Loser Workout is great for beginning and advanced levels. You can choose from 3 levels of workouts, starting with level one and adding levels 2 and 3 as you progress. There are also great warm up and cool down sections. Each move works more than one muscle group at a time which gives you more intensity in less time. I was excited to see some new moves and variations on old ones. Jillian, Bob and Kim are motivating and give easy to follow demos of the moves. I was frustrated at the time it took me at the gym to go from machine to machine that only worked one muscle group at a time. With this DVD I work my whole body in 50 minutes in the comfort of my own home. I am currently doing their ultimate results 6-8 week routine which combines doing the Biggest Loser Cardio Max and Power Sculpt DVD's on alternating days 4 to 5 times a week. I can already see the difference after only a couple weeks and am very satisfied with my purchase!!!"
5,Great workout!,"After doing the Biggest Loser Cardio Max DVD for 2 weeks, I started incorporating the Power Sculpt DVD every other day. I love that there are three levels and you can customize your workout. I have lost 23 lbs. in two months and I feel great."
5,Great Power Sculpt Workout!,This is power sculpt workout will make you work. I can tell you that you will sweat and your muscles will burn! I alternate this workout withThe Biggest Loser Workout: Cardio Max6 days a week andFat Free Yoga - Lose Weight & Feel Great w/ Ravi Singh & Ana Brett NOW W/THE **MATRIX** MENU OPTION!!!andCrunch - Super SlimDown: Pilates Yoga Blendat least 2 times a week. I have been doing this routine for 5-6 weeks now and have dropped 15 lbs. Hallelujah! I am grateful to have established a routine that works and can I do it in my own home. P.S. I ignore most of what the instructors say that is not pertinent to the exercise at hand. If you get too involved in what is spoken in general to the biggest loser's contestants it gets a bit annoying. Remember the goal... The workout does work :-)
1,Big Disappointment...,"I bought this because I am a big fan of the Biggest Loser. But this exercise dvd was a big disappointment to say the least. The only way I got anything out of it was to ONLY watch Bob, Jillian, and Kim on how to do the exercises. The contestants didn't know what they were doing and it made it really hard to follow. Big waste of money!!! I will stick with Jillian's dvds from now on."
4,for racing wooden soap box cars,"I use this Helmet for racing wooden soap box cars down steep inclines. Recently I had a wreck and it really worked, although a nail on a long piece of wood pierced my forehead (5 stiches). The Giro Transfer Sport Bike Helmet is a good buy.Sunlite Krypton Headlight LED Taillight ComboSunlite Krypton Headlight LED Taillight ComboPrinceton Tec Yukon Bike Light"
4,The Charge of the Model T's,"As an extra in this movie, I was impressed at the time, at how it was photographed--the authenticity that was put into it, the settings used. When we were invited to the premere, the whole theater burst with pride, viewing how the bits and pieces that were filmed, were put together to make an exciting and funny movie. I am very biased, however, it is a fun movie to enjoy."
2,Hoped it would be better,"When I read the jacket and description, I hoped for a fun book that I could read from cover to cover on the airplane. I read it cover to cover, but only because I didn't have anything else to do. Its obvious most of these authors have never worked on a collaboration before. Entire plot lines appear and disapear without rhyme or reason, and the whole book just seems to have been thrown together by people looking for an easy buck. This book reminds me of the Steve Martin Saturday Night Live Sketch about ""not phoning it in"". These authors all phoned it in. In the end, this book isn't bad, but it really isn't anything you'd bother reading if you knew what it was going to be like. Suffice to say this book would never have been published if not for the pre-established names of its authors. My advice is to buy that other book you are thinking about."
2,Silver Screw Missing,The silver screw is missing... so i cannot use this. I hope i will be able to find same at a store or so.
4,It does the job,"Every gigging musician knows that when something as petty as a Mic Clip gets broken, it is more than a little annoying. I have this as my spare and think it works just fine."
1,"Decent function, but toxic materials used","Yes, this clip is cheap. And the rubber does grab the mic fine. But this is obviously one of those Chinese made products that are made of toxic, highly off-gassing rubber. I wish companies would stop this practice of allowing their products to be made with toxic, smelly Chinese synthetic rubber."
5,A Hauntingly Dangerous Reading,"I was attacked by this book on more than one occasion. The first day I received the book it jumped out of the shipping carton and went straight for my jugular vien. I had to fight the book off. The very next day the book flew off the book shelf and caught me right at the bridge of my nose. I received 12 stitches to close the cut. Nothing happened for about a week, then one night the book clamped down on my head so hard I had a migraine. I do recommend the book, but I also recommend you put it in a safe place."
4,"Hey ""A Customer""?","So far, I have counted four 5 star reviews written by you, and four 1 star reviews as well! Whats up with that? Are you possessed yourself?"
3,Similar to Dan Brown -The Da Vinci Code,"Book is fiction there is simulation of real life situations.In this book we have fiction not real life exorcism evil is shown as ultimate power but this not truth !!!Power holds Jesus not devils.If any of you is looking for real life book I will advice Neil T Anderson books like ""The-Bondage-Breaker""The Bondage Breaker: Overcoming *Negative Thoughts *Irrational Feelings *Habitual Sins"
5,Beware of Possession,"Malachi Martin is a great writer and I found myself not wanting to put the book down. I believe we have just seen what a possessed person is capable of doing, with the Virginia Tech. shooting."
4,my thoughts,"i read this book after first reading M. Scott Peck's GLIMPSES OF THE DEVIL. Peck's book referred to this author as his mentor. Peck's book was a better read. this book was written by someone who was very much a writer. when i read it, i thought that the author spent more time than Peck in ""shaping"" the story. i do not doubt the details of the story at all but when you read it it almost reads like fiction, compared to Pecks' book. a very interesting book, to be sure."
1,A dash of Oral Roberts and P.T. Barnum,"What this book does is convince weak-minded Catholics and impressionable altar boys to keep patronizing the Church and donating money to support the whole facade. Nothing like a good ol' boogeyman masquerading as a priest to thump on his Bible and warn us of the evils in this world that will engulf us if we don't hand blank checks to our local Church! Malachi Martin spewed his rhetoric like Oral Roberts, Benny Hinn, and other great con men who know how to keep their money coffers full. Martin's ingenious spin was to use ""demonic possession"" an untapped racket that lost popularity after ""The Exorcist"" phase. Buy this book for scaring Boy Scouts sitting around the campfire."
5,Very good read,"A very detailed and sometimes chilling account of these exorcisms, I would recommend it to anyone interested in this topic."
5,The premier work on possession.,"This work will open your eyes to the world of demons and angels that we live in. It takes away the fear factor for anyone who thinks they might become ""possessed"" by describing the process of possession. It is also realistic enough in the case studies that it describes that it should dissuade any casual dabblers from being foolish enough to ""try"" an exorcism. A page turner that can change your life!"
4,"A great read, but....","Malachi Martin is a terrific writer, *BUT*1) Have any of these stories been independently verified (either the witnesses involved or the priests)?2) How much did Malachi interject of his own *creative* material?If the voices, cold rooms, and shaking furniture *actually* happened then we really have something going on here, but if these occurrences were interjected to make the stories exciting, then I'd say there is a problem.Any comments?"
3,Misuse of Malachi Martin's book,Malachi Martin's writings are being used to destroy the lives of innocent people. Intergenerational devil cults and multiple personalities are injected into the minds of patients of bad psychiatrists. These incompetent doctors are influenced by stories for which there is little or no proof of their validity.
4,Good ideas,"Lots of neat ideas for pizzas - they're more gourmet style than anything. Each recipe has a picture which is just wonderful - large, colorful. The recipes themselves don't get me all that excited. Some of them are things that you might have for dinner (like a salad or a chinese stir-fry) and the author put them onto a pizza crust. But there are some interesting ones like the spinach pizza (sauted spinach with garlic, raisins and pine nuts put onto a pizza crust with melted cheese) and some ofthe eggplant recipes are neat. The Athenian pizza is excellent - feta, red onion, mushroom, olives etc baked on the pizza crust. And there are some interesting ones that I'm looking forward to trying that use different pestos. Overall good cookbook with inventive ideas and very pretty presentation that you could easily serve to guests."
5,THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!,I heard about this movie from a coach on my team. I had some money so i bought it and was astonished. It is unbeleivable. The camera angles are amazing and the jumps are even better. Romain de Marchi has an amazing part and so does everyone else. Definetely a buy.
4,We'll See.,"I just bought this Feit Electric Eternalite NL1/LED. All seems to work well. It gives a lifetime guarantee, but who's going to worry about a five-dollar item? It says that it costs less then twenty-five cents a year to use, but how would you check out that claim? It says that the bulb has a 100,000-hour life. Anyone got a timer? In any case, I needed a night light and none of my others seemed to last long. This one looks okay and seems to work well. Is it the answer? We'll see.Gary Peterson"
1,delightfully French!,"This book is delightful! Fresh metaphors and quotable lines abound. I feel like a French way of thinking and living permeates this book, and the translation captures a way of thought that is different from that in America. Another thing I noticed is the proliferation of cross-age friendships, as people of many different stages of life join their lives together. This book is a definite ""keeper""!"
4,BIG!,"I got this toy for my kids.They played with it a few times but not alot. It is NOT worth your money.They did not find it very amussing.although they do like ""hiding"" themselfs.They like to jump off the sides into the balls.dodn't buy this for a child 2 years or yonger.Or 13 years or older.The prouduct is very very very big."
1,Texas-Sized Disappointment,"The plot is one more of the four standard romance story lines. Girl comes back -- temporarily, she thinks -- to the small town she fled years before. Circumstances conspire to keep her at home and too close to the dangerous male whose touch renders her helpless. In After Tex, the formula becomes a tired one. The hero is stripped of his danger too early on. There are too many subplots and too many characters. To make matters worse, the author's descriptions of the interaction between the main characters were insipid. If you like your romances hot, skip this one."
3,"Good bag, but not very heavy","This is a nice standing bag for kickboxing. I did realize it was smaller than the ones at the gym where I take class, but I didn't realize how much smaller. I'm not a big person, female, haven't worked out regularly, not a lot of strength, but when I punch and kick this I have to chase it all over the basement. The base is heavy enough so it won't topple over (I filled mine with water as instructed) but overall it is not heavy and sturdy enough to stay in place. So when I work out with it, it is also very loud as it wobbles all over the cement floor. Probably not suitable for anyone much larger than me (135 lbs.)"
4,Can't punch the stuffing out of it...,"...but it does scoot around the room.It arrived in a timely fashion, well-packaged and easy to set up.I filled the base with 150# sand. I'm admittedly strong for a 63-year-old woman, but it did surprise me that when I punch the bag it scoots a little with each impact; literally slowly ""walking"" across the room. I think they make a stouter/heavier model; I would recommend that one, if you have any punch.I did order gloves, since my knuckles reddened while gently testing a 70# bag at a retail store."
4,Fill it with sand?,"Agree with other reviews -- good size, moves somewhat as the base is not heavy. The instructions say: can fill the base with water or sand. To make it heavier, we've decided to try sand. Guess what? The opening is as big as the opening in a gallon of milk. So, the statement to fill it with water OR sand is misleading. We still put sand in by cutting the the empty gallon of milk pack and using it as a funnel to poor sand it. It was a huge pain. One person has to poor and the other has to hold ""funnel"" as the openings were the exact same size and did't fit together. We did it finally. It was VERY difficult. Sand made the base quite sturdy, more so than water would. But what a stupid design. It is made for water fill only with the hose. Don't even listen about sand fill being a realistic fill options, unless you are ready to do the ""acrobatics"" that my hubby and I did, which was a giant drag."
4,Great product.,"Although hard to fill and sometimes it moves around when I am punching it, I give it 4 stars for the money! BAM!"
1,they carried things,I am not a book reader I realy do not like to read. But i guess this book realy is not to bad. It tells you a lot about the war in a real life way. I would tell anyone to read it if they can stay awake.
5,Beautiful writing,"This has been on my ""to read"" list for years. I'm so glad I finally got to it. It is very powerful and amazingly beautifully written. It is a sort of memoir of his time in Vietnam but it also incorporates storytelling from other's points of view. It's one of those books where you feel as if you've been kicked in the gut when you finish."
3,Paul's review of Things they carry,"I tought the book was good, because someone that was actually in the war wrote it and not someone that just heard about the war and wanted to become famous and write about Vietnam. He told some true stories about Vietnam and made some up, but they werent actually made up they happened but he made them more detailed than they were to get you to feel the way he felt. He took his daughter there to experience the atmosphere that he felt when he was in war. He feels guilty for Kiowa's death but there was nothing any of them could of done to save his life. Some of them playied games everynight to relax after a long day at war."
5,The Things They Carried: How it struck me then and now.,"I read this book when I was a senior in high school and now that I am in the Air Force, I have read it again. It tells us about ourselves, and how we react to the truly ""weird"" things that happen in war. O'Brien has the ability, through his stories, to tell us his feelings, and show us our own."
5,Great book about the baggage our troops carry,"I have read numerous books about the Vietnam war, and found this book to be a departure from some of the typical recounts of the Vietnam war.I found it interesting to read about what occurred, both emotional and physical, without too much blood and guts.An unique book and perspective."
2,A Disappointed Reader,"Overall, I was not impressed by Tim O'Brien's book, The Things They Carried. The book does contain some entertaining stories, for example, when O'Brien listed all the items and the little superstitions of the men in his platoon. Throughout the rest of the book he writes scattered stories, some of which are admittedly false. The way Tim O'Brien weaves facts and fiction into his war stories does not appeal to me. He concludes that Vietnam was a waste of life and money, but then lies while writing about such a serious subject. I feel this was a very inappropriate and does not do justice to the other veterans of the Vietnam War. On the whole, I feel the book was horribly written and is unable to grasp a reader and incapable of giving you the desire to keep reading."
3,The Story of What Tim Carried,"As a VN vet from the same time as the book, the language and vivid recollections brought back my own memories. And, as in the book, those memories are not just about my friends who died in VN. They are about all the ghosts from my life.It's a good book and I resonate with O'brian's decision to share some of his most painful memories. But the story-telling is at times uneven. And some stories have drifted too far from reality. I loved Going After Cachiatto. This isn't the same story."
4,The Things They Carried,"First of all I chose ""The Things They Carried"" at the recommendation of a friend who knew I was a Viet Nam veteran (second reason). I enjoyed the book because It brought back memories of sites, sounds and smells of a period I would rather forget. It was a terrible battle, the purpose I understood, but was it worth it for the price of over 55,000 American lives and how it changed the course of those of us who came back. What different paths would our careers have taken? How would the structure of our families been different? Would the ""peace movement"" have even happened? Would today's drug problems even be here? The story line jumped continually but so did the author's life while in country. A recommended reading for all Vets."
4,"Well done, but Preferred IN PHAROH'S ARMY by Tobias Wolff","Tim O'brien tells a good story, and mixes in fact--or the illusion of fact--and fiction skillfully. Still, sometimes the fiction just didn't work for me; most notably, when one of the soldier's girlfriends came and turned from cheerleader type to bush-soldier extraordinarie. I understand the methaphor/aim of this, but it seemed over the top. For a pitch-perfect wonderful, fact/memoir of Vietnam, I think IN PHAROH'S ARMY is a masterpiece. If you're not familiar with Tobias Wolff, you're in for a treat."
1,the things they carried,"If you do not read much this is a book you do not want to pick up. ""The Things They Carried"" will bore you with its slow storyline and its repetitiveness. Above all this book tricks one into believing this is a historical account of the life aof Tim O' Brien as a Veitnam soldier. Tim O'Brien writes about Veitnam even though he did not serve there, making this book fictional. What false representation! I would therefore not recommend this book to anyone."
5,I now understand about the things they carried,"Tim O'Brien's book allowed me to truly understand that the moral truth is in the eyes of the storyteller when reciting a war tale, or war experience. The soldier can endure many of things, but to be timid on the battlefield is the biggest embarrassment, shame to a soldier, and that's what each soldier carried. So, always be aware of what is fact, fiction, or even enhanced when listening to the next war story that is told, which he phrased in his book. This was my first time reading his book. I can truly say that ""The Things They Carried' is a excellent, detailed, and wonderful collection of short stories I've read today.Great Job, Mr. O'Brien.You have made me a fan of your writing.Ted Johnson (DVC's English Student)"
5,"YES, THEY DID","AS A VIETNAM VET....AND AS AN OFFICER THAT CARED FOR HIS MEN....I OFTEN FOUND IT AMAZING AS TO THE 'THINGS THEY CARRIED'. SITTING AROUND IN THE MUD WITH THEM...(OF COURSE THEY HAD ''UNAUTHORIZED'' 'THINGS'.... ) SO TRUE ABOUT THE RABBITS FOOT, THE TATTERED PHOTO OF A YOUNG WOMAN...A COIN....SO MANY THINGS WERE PULLED OUT OF THOSE JUNGLE FATIGUES...THANKS FOR THE BOOK..."
5,"Blood, Sweat, and Tears, All shed in Vietnam","""The Things They Carried"" is a story about the struggles and hardships of the Vietnam War. If you liked the movie ""Platoon"" you will enjoy this book because it contains the same powerful war scenes and mental images that the movie does. Once you start reading it will be hard for you to put this book down. The book allows you to get into the minds of the soldiers and it gives you the feeling of what it's like to be there and what war is like. Fiction or reality, it doesn't matter, as you read you will understand more about what the Vietnam war was all about and what the young U.S. soldiers went through. ""The Things They Carried"" will move you and force you to have a greater respect for our Vietnam Vets. This war is a big part of our countries history and ""The Things They Carried"" by Tim O'Brien is a tribute to all the brave men who lost their lives over seas. Read It!"
2,Disturbing,Although I appreciated his vivid description of the scenery I could have done without the multiple instances of severe animal cruelty.
3,The Things They Carried,"Tim O'Brien is a very interesting author. When reading the book I was so curious as to what he was thinking while writing all these stories. He gives question to the if the story you are reading is real or if it had just been created from the depths of this very eccentric author's imagination. I felt question, mystery and sometimes even confusion. But, reading this was worth it and was very informative about the Vietnam war and even more about the lives of the soldiers and the emotional baggage of what they went through. I also learned a lot about the author. He becomes one of his characters, real or not, and describes his fears, wants, and needs to great detail. I would be very curious to learn more about him and read more of his works."
4,Hard working writer makes for good book written creatively!,The Things They Carried by TIM O'BRIEN Who is an excellentWriter with many interesting vehicles to get his point nofeeling across to the reader. His messages are some times goryand a bit crass though this is entertaining for me. There aremany flash back and forward points that may be hard to keep upwith if you can't afford to pay the attention the authordemands however the High School vocab makes for an easy ridethrough the many partially connected stories throughout thebook.I wish I had the time to blab all day about the book myrecommendation is that you read it for your self.-Dustin A. Torson
5,"Thought Provoking, Thoughtful, Emotional","Read this book over 10 years ago for high school. It was one of those that really made you think, put you in the state of mind and emotions of the character. A bit depressing - but within context of being a soldier in a war that you did not want to be in; it was pretty powerful. Best of all, there's no deep political, overly spiritual, or wildly insane interjections that one would see in other war or Vietnam books and movies - and no Oliver Stone-like crap. It is O'Brien's observations of his surroundings, his feelings, his recollections of the people around him, and his thoughts about the state of things without deep political or societal analysis. It makes the book a very enjoyable, there at the moment, transport to another world, type of read."
5,Great story,"Tim O'Brien has written a classic. In college I read and did reports on his short story about the ""Lemon Tree"". It was a story that I had forgotten about and rediscovered with this book. Great writing and different point of view that makes this an easy read with deeper meaning."
3,Heather Clark pd.4,"The Things They Carried was written by Tim O'Brien. The story takes place during the Vietnam War. The story is told by Tim O'Brien and when he was in the War. It is like a bunch of little stories about the guys he was in the war with and what happened to them. He talks about the guy he killed and regrets killing. The chapter called ""The Man I Killed"" talks about the guy he killed and what his childhood was like and what it would be like now if O'Brien wouldn't have killed him. Tim O'Brien lost 5 of his closes friends and the girl he loved sense the fourth grade in the War. Overall I think ""The Things They Carried"" was a pretty good book"
3,The Things They Carrried,"The Things They Carried provides a first hand experience of life on the front lines. Tim o'Brien takes your right into the Vietnam jungle and reflects on a series of stories from men fighting in the war. Some stories include things that the men carried for good luck and how the men spent their time between battles. The book also shows how troops took the loss of another soldier and how they deal with death surrounding them. While reading The Things They Carried, you are able to picture yourself in the middle of a war, as if you were in Iraq fighting for your country. The first person account of the story is truly unique and descriptive. This book is a must read for all those who are fascinated or curious about what life is like in war, or just want to hear some interesting war stories. Readers beware, there are some graphic passages and crude language."
3,My Review,I think this is a pretty good book because it tells what normal people went through before and during the war. It shows that no one is too good to go to war. It tells people what they had to go through when their friends died or when they killed people and how you had to get over it and get on with your life.
2,Not what I expected,The first story (Hell...) completely soured my enjoyment of the book. It was preachy and not at all science fiction. From then on I was looking for the religious underpinnings/sermon in the rest of the stories and finding quite a bit of it. Wings might as well have been Touched by an Angel's attempt at a Roswell episode.
4,none,Once again editor Hayden has given SF fans a reason to cheer; another superb and solid read from a solid line up of the best SF authors around today! Gary S. Potter Author/Poet
2,GREAT ALBUM/BAD SOUNDING CD!!!,"I too am disappointed in the big lie about this CD beingremastered. My CD copy made on my Phillips CD recorder fromthe old Makin' Magic Vinyl LP sounds better than this CD fromHolland. My CD copy from LP has a couple of pops but theclarity is much superior to this Dutch garbage! I know Patis selling some of his back catalog at his shows on CD and Isincerely hope he's selling homemade versions of his earlymasterpieces like Makin' Magic, Black Pearl, Hot Shot andthe ones that have been available on domestic and/or importCDs for years such as Putting It Straight, Heat In The Street,Go For What You Know and Crash and Burn. I feel ripped offthat my amazon arrival of Makin' Magic sounded so flat!"
2,Dont buy....,"This bath ""pillow"" is so small its not comfortable at all, it does not cradle My back and I am a small person, I have bought other bath pillows on amazon that were 100 times better, My suggestion go with another company!!"
1,Preachy,"Buyer beware. While it has many interesting elements, this anime is constantly preaching about the environment, to the point of asserting that even weeding gardens goes against nature. I'm all for caring about the environment, and I'm a big anime fan, but I couldn't take hours and hours of the relentless propagandizing. Had they toned down the rhetoric, this would have been a fun title but as it is now it is preachy to the point of being ludicrous."
3,"Looks great, poor ergonomics","This is a very heavy, well-made press (handles 3 big cloves at once). Unfortunately, the short fat handles make it more difficult than it should be to crush the garlic payload. I have good hand strength and it takes two hands to press the garlic through. If I were to do it over, I think I'd buy the Oxo press instead.An edit as of 2/4/06--I may have gotten a bad press--a couple of months ago, the press fell apart at a couple of weld points, where the stainless press block meets the handle assembly. Bought a Wusthof press and it has worked fine."
1,Cheap Ink cartridges,You get what you pay for. Both cartridges I received do not work at all. I will never order cheap ink again! Dave
1,remanufactured printer cartridges,"I ordered three of these. The first one worked about two weeks quite well, then my printer would print no more because of a cartridge error. I snapped it in and out about 10x, with the same printer fault. Then I installed a new un-remanufactured cartridge and it worked perfectly. Then I replaced the original remanufactured cartridge and got the same error. I tried the second and third remanufactured cartridges, and both wouldn't print bacause of cartridge error. Never again."
1,this was horrible,"I guess it's ok since the book at least has a story but omg, it was SOOOO bland. it's like drinking soup but realizing it's just a bowl of plain water with maybe a tad of salt. i didn't finish the book because i was bored out of my mind. i tried SO hard to stay awake and focus on this horrible book, but it didn't last... omg... it's just so horrible"
5,Best thing since sliced Bread!,I have used this for over 10 years. I have always had canker sores and nothing ever lasted long or usually ended up hurting more after using it too long. I had a doctor recommend this to me after an accident that left large cuts and stitches in my mouth. This numbed the pain and help the healing process. If you get canker sores or have any cuts inside the mouth or on your lips this stuff rocks.
5,superb tempi,"To my opinion, the key to the ultimate listening experience is the right tempi. Bach should dance, but not in St Matthews Passion. How on earth can you dance at ""Kommt, ihr Toechter helf mir klagen"" (opening choir) or "" Wir setzen uns mit Traenen nieder"" (closing choir). In most modern performances you hear Bach at Ferrari like tempi, to make it dance. Performances of 40 years ago are really the opposite: they are so slow that you only hear tears but no Bach.Bach Metthews should relate to a gentle walk. You should feel the movements but it should be calm.I live in The Netherlands, the country where the St Matthews Passion is very much part of the national musical culture (most of us listen to St Matthews every year at the Sunday or the Friday before Eastern). I really hope that next year the tempi will be back where they should be: at the tempi of this Vanguard Classic Recording."
2,Great sound. Terribly uncomfortable!!!,"I found the Grado SR 225i's far too uncomfortable to wear. I'm sure for normal ears they feel ok, but one of my ears was burned badly and the sratchy interior of the Grado ear cup rubs against the deformed cartiledge. If only the foam part covered the entire interior and not just the circumference. The sound however was top notch! I just wish I could enjoy the quality for any amount of time.I returned them and got the Sennheiser HD 25-1's instead. I've tried those before and they felt nice on my ears.Also, for such expensive headphones, you'd think they'd take more care and finesse with the packaging. It was exceptionally flimsy."
4,Great sound but...,"I really enjoyed these, though I can't seem to adapt well to supra-aural phones - I guess I like the perception of isolation that you get with circumaural.These compared very favorably to the pair of Senn HD650s I was also trying out. I particularly liked the bass, which was very present but not overly punchy (I am not a basehead). The sound is overall pretty dry, but very detailed.In the end, I returned them due to the feeling of sandpaper foam on my ears. I don't understand why Grado keeps the same abrasive foam pads given the amount of criticism they get. Is it tradition to dermabrade your pinnae?Am happy with the Senns - I couldn't go beyond an hour of listening on the Grados."
2,good sound quality but uncomfortable to wear,"The sound quality is good and I bought them in a store after trying on several different brands. They sounded the best, but when I got them home and began to use them at 1-2 hour sittings I realized how the ear cans felt uncomfortable. They are rough and scratchy on the ears - takes a lot of the pleasure out of the listening experience. I'm going to have to get some other brand because I don't enjoy wearing these."
4,Black and Decker SZ360 CORDLEES SCISSORS,"These scissors work very well for us. You can not cut up thick mail very easily with these. I tried to cut up credit card offers with the scissors and they did not do well but for opening mail, cutting fabric, paper cardboard they are good. Glad I bought them."
4,I bought a second one as back-up.,"I have a project where I have to cut out many, many items out of felt. This is very hard on my hand with a scissors. I looked all over for some type of medium duty power scissors. There are battery operated ones (cheap) and very expensive ($100s) industrial ones. I took a shot on these and have been very happy. They zip right through the heavy felt. The rechargeable battery works forever. It has a good hand feel too.I did try to cut a plastic package and it didn't do so well but I don't think it was designed for that. It is a scissors and does what scissors do . It cuts through fabric and soft material. (a razor device cuts through plastic).I like these things so much , and they seem discontinued so I bought a second one as back-up."
3,Black & Decker SZ360 3.6 Cordless Power Scissors,"I ordered the scissors to help finish tearing up carpet, since my wrist gave out. The scissors are great, but they don't work on carpet, unfortunately."
5,Black & Decker SZ360T 3.6V Cordless Power Scissors,WONDERFUL - Like a hot knife through soft butter. I got them to trim up quilts after the quilting has been completed and they are great. I never realized how easy they are to use and there is absolutely NO stress on your hands compared to regular scissors or even rotary cutter!! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tool for your sewing or craft room.
1,As powerful as a cold knife through frozen butter,"These were a complete disappointment. I would recommend that you look elsewhere, these sissors are the answer to nothing!"
5,Great for Everyone,"I don't have arthritis, I didn't suffer from a stroke, I don't have back problems. I have no excuse for not using old fashioned scissors but I LOVE these Black & Decker power scissors. For wrapping paper alone, they're worth the price. Now my packages look neat with smooth edges.But when you consider that you can open those hard plastic packages without risk of slicing an artery, what's not to love? (Perhaps to make you appreciate them more when you're using them, they do come packaged in a hard plastic nightmare.)"
5,A Handy-Dandy Little Appliance,"Just the slickest little cordless electric appliance you'll have in your paws for cutting paper, cloth, canvas, screen wire, plastic sheeting, poster board, etc.. I mean fast, clean, neat, comfortable to operate, and turns on a dime! Makes quick work at what ever task it can handle ... and that's most any reasonable material that any heavy duty scissors can handle only much faster, and forget the repetitive action fatgue factor ... there isn't any. Got a problem with ""corpal-Tunnel""? .. Forget it with this little jewel.It's worth the price just for wrapping Christmas gifts!"
4,How to open a clamshell product wrapper with the power scissors,Length:: 1:34 MinsMike Schilli shows how to use the Black&Decker; Power Scissors to open a new product in a clam shell.
3,NO WARRANTY,"I bought this product and was happy with it but it got so it would not hold a charge. I called B&D since it is supposed to have a 2 year warranty and they said it is discontinued and nothing for replacement. So if you buy, do not consider the warranty as it actually has none."
4,power scissors,Power scissors work well. They're easy to operate and cut efficiently. Insertion of the scissors into the holder is very difficult. The holder's value is questionable at best.
1,Almost manufactured IN China,"I got this on a Gold Box special, for what I thought was a good price. I'm now back to using my ""old"" way of opening up plastic encased products, which is by using my Stanley heavy duty box cutter.These scissors will barely cut through a thin sheet of paper, so that the ""good price"" I got them for should have been about 90% lower than what I paid.This pair of Black and Decker scissors really does rate a 0 and is one of the worse pieces that I've purchased since, now, all Black and Decker tools are being made in China.I won't be buying any more Black and Decker products."
4,Great scissors,"So far so good. They're a little loud, sort of remind me of a tattoo machine. The scissors do cut blister packaging, but the initial cut into a package isn't as easy as it looks. Once you get over that, it's easy. Over all, I think this is a great product."
4,who can help me finding......,"the older Alessi brothers albums on CD??? I wanna buy it for a friend, but no chance of buying it here in the netherlands or over the internet. so I have to find a used one or anyone willing to make a copy for me. I would like to find 'greatest hits' and 'oh lori' .... this newer album sound very good, and very much ""alessi-like"" you'll enjoy this as much as you did earlier albums, so did I."
3,"Ok, but cheap looking","I purchased this item for my husband to wear to a formal wedding. The item arrived as promised and in good condition.The fit was good, but the fabric both looked and felt a bit cheap. Overall, a nice vest compared to the price.I will absolutely consider this seller to another occasion."
5,Economic Recovery,Trying to make ends meet? This is a economic releif. Not too loud but finese enough to match any of your many black suits or jackets. I tried the other vests they have way2loud. This is definitely the best vest btw I got two.
