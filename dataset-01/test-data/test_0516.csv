5,Get this While you still can...,I couldn't believe that I actually got my hands on this in the first place and when I got it I still couldn't believe that I had it...Once I opened the box it was over the video shows some real rare stuff from the early 90's and it goes all the way up to the 2001 tour of the U.S. it is truly awesome to see...The Cd's are just GREAT too all sorts of hard to get and re mastered songs just for the box set Marduk did one hell of a job on this...If there are any left anywhere I'd get another one if I can find one and if you don't have one GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great Show,"The packaging of the product was fine, and the dvd itself is great. The series is amazing. I def reccomand it"
3,Satisfying purchase.,"I've been looking for a volleyball for a while. To be specific, I wanted one that I could use at the beach that does not bruise your wrists.Note: I play volleyball for purely (amateur) recreational reasons and this one was definitely something that fit into my needs.Pros (+) and Cons (-):1. Does not cause welts on wrists. (+)2. Someone mentioned that this was a plastic child's ball, this is partly true. The Squish volleyball is pretty much one of those plastic handballs in a foamy volleyball disguise. I think it was designed for pool usage. Read: Not a real volleyball. (-)3. The red/white/blue design is very attractive. (+)4. Too bouncy and light. It will literally fly over half the beach if you hit it hard enough. Again, not a real volleyball. (-)I like it."
2,WRONG ITEM SENT,"I ordered this item on the basis that it offer FM radio capability. This feature was clearly stated in the product description WITH NO MENTION OF IT BEING AN OPTION. The name of the item includes the phrase ""FM Radio PCI Card""When I got the item it did NOT have FM capability and the supporting documentation indicated that it is an option on certain models only.This error was extremely upsetting to me since I am unable to return the item (because it was taken out of the USA).[...]"
1,Poor Quality,I wasnt satisfied with the product It arranged the tv channels in its own order picture quality is good but the sound is too low and I reallySabrent SBT-TVFM TV Tuner/Video Capture/FM Radio PCI Card with Remote Controlhave too press my ears too the speakers too hear. Some channels appeared plank despite running the scan. I am not satisfied with this product.
5,Profound Practical Psychology,"Never before has the art and technique of true meditation been so vividly and practically explained as in this work. If you want to learn how to meditate, look no further.Within it is an amazing overview of the practical work upon one's own psychology. This book is truly revolutionary as the author goes into detail of the necessity of an Integral Pyschological Revolution within our own interior.Readers should keep in mind that this book is one that must be studied profoundly for many years (as recommend by the author). As you progress in your inner development you will see how multiple readings is necessary as you will gain more information each time."
2,Way to small!!!,The shoe covers are at least 1 1/2 sizes smaller then was stated in the discription. The grip on the bottom of cover is minimal at best. However for home use and with a size 8 or smaller size shoe this will work.
2,made cheap,I was all excited to get these because they would save me from buying new shoes every month(for work) But when i put them on before work they ripped and fell apart.If you have size 13 or above buy XXL
1,Not anti-skid,"I wear a size 13 work shoe with Vibram soles, and the XL size fits fine. That feature earns one star. But, the anti-skid feature does not work at all. With these covers on, our crew's feet slip on tile, wood and marble surfaces to such a degree, we have to take off the covers when we go up wooden stairs. That defeats the purpose of the covers and upsets some of my customers. You should not purchase this product if the anti-skid feature is important to you. I'll report back to this review if I find a better product."
3,clean lady,"Ordered the disposable shoe covers to have when repairmen come into my home and can not take off their shoes to do work. I have carpeting and do not like outside dirt inside. The product is okay, but they needed to use a couple of pairs to complete a project, they are not that durable ..... just okay!!"
1,Too small,"I got these for the end of construction which took a bit longer than expected. I would love to return it, but it was too late by the time we opened up a box and realized hiw tiny these covers are. I mean tiny, I am size 8 and can barely pull them over my sneakers. Never mind size 12+ contractor's boots! Very disappointing!"
5,A nice smooth ride,This artist will not let you down if your looking for some peace at theend of a day.I hope he puts out many more cds to come!
1,Time for a change,"This obsolete text has been forced on actuarial students for decades. Time to get rid of it.The book is grossly deficient in practical applications. Yeah, it's called theory, but actuaries are supposed to apply the theories, not memorize them like so many abstract algebra concepts.Buy the Schaum's Outline. If you can find it, get the book from Butcher & Nesbitt that has been out of print. Completely superior.[...]Time for a change."
2,Maybe if you are a high risk pregnancy,"This book/organizer is for the expectant mom who needs to track her daily intake - down to how much water she drinks - but not for anyone who wants to enjoy her pregnancy & not worry about & write down everything she eats for the next couple of months - So, unless you are a high risk pregnancy or completly neurotic - this book is not for you - at least I know it's not for me!"
5,Great Companion to the Book,It was so useful and at the end of my pregnancy it became part of my daughter's keepsake box. The organizer was extremely helpful and would recommend this to any expectant mother.
2,Not-so-sparkly,"My sister,Lene, recieved this doll for her 6th birthday and she liked it very much. She played with it alot but the doll soon lost all her sparkles, and the wing's fabric somehow separated. She was very sad but moved on, however now we got addicted to collecting Fairytopia dolls. I'm 16 and I collect lots of things especially Japanese imported anime things but I also collect cool-looking differen't dolls. I really like the fairytopia dolls not so much the one's based on the movie like the Elina and Jewelia ones but I like the Early ones. I have the blue and Lavender Sparkle fairies and the Pink and Aqua mermaids. I usually buy 2 of each one for my sis and one to add to my collection. I think this fairy looks very different and nice it's great for collectors but I'm not sure for little girls. It adds beauty to my collection but it doesn't do too well as a play-toy."
5,Loved it on BET,I loved watching this series on BET. Hopefully the DVD has extras. Very informative and entertaining series. No way I was not going to order this when it came on DVD.
2,La Cafetiere 8-Cup Replacement Beaker,"The product is fine, keeps you from throwing away your La Cafetiere holders for any beakers you may have dropped. Value for price is low however, as you csn pick up a whole new La Cafetier coffee press at places liek TJ MAxx for $15.00. WT"
5,Good replacement,"It took me a while to get the glass replacement in (i feel that is still a bit off), but it worked fine!Thank you!"
2,Extremely fragile,I was please to find how easy it way to slide the replacement beaker into the handle of my coffee press. I was not pleased when my brand new beaker shattered when I barely tapped the sink as I washed it for the first time!
5,Perfect Fit,"I got this to replace the glass we broke from a La Cafetiere French Press we got at TJMaxx.The french press is the one with solid metal stripes at the bottom, this replacement glass beaker had a hard time fitting so we has to widen the metal french press a bit where the stripes met. I got the feeling that the replacement beaker is quite fragile.So far it works well :)"
3,Quite a Stretch,"Although this story was more detailed than the first season's, it was not nearly as tight and the ending was contrived to match the beginning moments. This same thing was done in season 1 but with perfection; here it was forced and obviously just a gimmick. The story took tangents which did all eventually come together BASICALLY but nothing astounding. It lacked the punch of the first season and this was sad becasuse season 1 was so brilliant."
3,Nothing much new here,"If you're already a ""classicist"" you'll just roll your eyes and skim through this. Be forewarned-- there is a LOT of blank space and large type in this book. The 160 page description is deceiving. The book measures only 5 3/4 x 6 inches and I read it in 1/2 hour. It's a magazine article in book form.I couldn't quite get the author's curious obsession with CAFTANS; ghastly garments--and guaranteed to make ANYONE look fat! Shouldn't one raise at least one perfectly groomed eyebrow at any book that has Audrey Hepburn on the cover yet extols the virtues of CAFTANS? Hmmmmmm.The author also has a thing for white high heeled pumps, which most women would do well to avoid; except perhaps on their wedding day."
1,Save your money!,.............and buy just about any other book. This book is poorly organized and I can' think of a single bit of information I haven't read many times. Spend your money on something else.
3,Equivalent to 60 watt conventional light bulb,These light give off much less light than conventional 100 Watt light bulb with dimmer switch at the maximum setting. In case you need a 100 watt long life bulb i suggest you buy a 150 watt bulb form the same maker.
5,100-watt bulbs,well it will be a year this march and 4 of my six pack are still working !! ya ** Note ** all of my bulbs are in use in an outside enviroment.
5,Good value.,"Despite the cost, this lamp seems to be of a higher value on appearance. I have three of these in my home now. They are delicate, but hold up well over the years. Not only do they share light, they add a certain ambience to the room. I would recommend it. There is easy assembly required and what is needed is in with the lamp. Fluorescent bulbs are OK if one does not want to dim it."
1,Cheap and poorly made,The case did not even fit my Nokia 5300. It looked cheap and was impossible to get onto the phone. I returned it the same day I received it.
4,Padded metal caliper case,"This is a nice case however, I was hoping for a softer inside. I also had to increase the cutout lenght to accommodate my Starrett Calipers."
3,cute book! It will brighten your day .,"This book is really cute.Anyone who saw the film should read this book,along with Gump&Co.(the sequel to Forrest Gump.)These series of books allow you to fallow Gump into the next decade and beyond.You'll have fun reading this book.Enjoy!!"
2,DISAPPOINTED...,"Unfortunately, this was not up to par for Tyler Perry's stage plays. The story line seems to have been thrown together. None of the story lines of the characters seemed to come together. Tyler Perry's longgggggg talk after the funeral seemed more like a sermon than a part of the play. It was just to long and then his exit was abrupt and out of place in the play. I know that the stage play was cut short because Tyler was tired, and it was apparent that he was not at his best. The singing was awesome in this play, but the rest of the play was a disappointment. As in his other plays, there was not even a song at th end that bought everyone together. It was just awful and sad. If I had paid money to see this, I would have been highly upset. My family, who are ages, 49, 44, 20 & 18 all feel the same way about this play. I wish him better on the next play. TYLER, PLEASE REST BEFORE YOU FILM AGAIN.."
3,way to long!,I am a fan of Madea's but this was way to long with way to many songs. I love that Mr. Perry gives us our moneys worth and then some. This one is on the bottom of the list for me
3,Not So Fast,"This is a good play. Could have been very good, if there was not so much singing. I know that singing is a part of any play, but this one was ""overkill."""
5,Great Play,This was one of Tyler Perry's best plays to date! The cast was superb. I bought this as a gift for my Mom for her to enjoy since the play didn't make it to Boston. She enjoyed it and says she will watch it over and over again not only for the entertainment but for the message it brings.
3,Not as simple as expected,"I read the reviews on Amazon and thought I'd found the perfect glaze book! However, it doesn't do well for beginning glaze makers. It's cumbersome in that it lists temperature ranges rather than cone numbers. Some of the glazes are pictured on the same page as the recipe but not all, so it's difficult to guess what the colors will look like. Overall, I didn't like the format. I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it. I may even return the book."
2,I didn't like this book,"If tried about 6 of these glazes. None are really very impressive, some are boring or have problems, which are not detailed in remarks. Also, tiny little photos don't give an idea of how it will look, and there are not even photos (thumbnails?) of all the glazes in the book. They aren't on the same page as the recipe, so you have to hunt for them. Some of the photos in the book have no recipe listed!! Kinda crappy book."
4,Shows Improvement,"We've recently starting using Epakitin for our cat, Tucker, who has been diagnosed with renal failure. He's also getting Ringer solution IV's every other day. Along with the Epakitin we're seeing some improvement in his energy and alertness. We'll continue to do everything we can for Tucker."
3,Cheap fakes.,"I bought these to put out as fake securety for an old flat about four or five years ago. They run on batteries, and for someone who wouldn't know the diffrence between a fake and real securety camera they might work.However, they are motionless, and though they have a red light the camera lens are not very convincing.If you really want sercurety then buying a real camera with a recorder for about $100 is probably the way to go.If you want to simply have a low rate securety and hope that people will be convinced by the fake camera's presence, then these might be a cheap way to go."
3,"Very Slow Arrival, Good book",It took almost three weeks for my book to arrive! It was in good condition when I finally arrived. There are a few places with black magic marker but I paid a great price for it so I won't complain about the marks. But I am complaining about how long it took me to get the book!
5,Farina has out done himself again,"Just like the intro says ""make sure you have your own personal copy to play again and again when you feel yourself getting off the track."" Never before have I heard an album that can guide you through such a relaxing experience. No matter how horrible your day may have been or how bad you may be feeling, one spin of this cd and you will forget about all your troubles. With the smooth jazzy beats that seamlessly transition from tract to tract, Farina has produced another classic in the Mushroom Jazz series. If you are a fan or if you are just begining to discover the Mushroom Jazz series, this is must have in any collection."
5,Nice & compact,This works great for a li'l project/songwriter desk. I switched directions on the top shelf so the speakers are angled in correctly. I thought at first that the bottom shelf thing was an iSore but it's coming in really handy for keeping the cables and computer stuff off of the floor. The cable panel on the back is brilliant!
1,Bad incident,I got this fairytopia doll for my sister's birthday. It was the kind with the sparkly shirt.It is a tradition to wash any plastic toy we get to get rid of some of the germs. We started washing it and all the sparkles came off. My sister was really angry at me.So we got rid of the doll. I NEVER want to see this doll again.
1,What a Joke!,"Oh My Gosh! These things are so tiny. Dangerous for small children, curious pets, don't drop them or they'll be lost forever. 12 sheets of what paper? Rice paper? I used 22 lb 8.5"" X 11"" will hold 6 sheets. I also have the OXO clip magnets and they are so great. Buy the OXO magnets."
3,Mediocre Fare,"This was an okay book, but not a great one. The romance was very slow, and sometimes hard to follow or believe. I found Brett a much more sympathetic character, as it often seemed he had escaped one wife who was frigid to fall in love with another. For the heroine, Sarah, I really wanted to sympathize with her, but it was hard. I wanted to shake her all the time and scream at her to open her eyes and quit feeling sorry for herself. Millions of women get jilted every day unfortunately, but they don't spend the rest of their lives feeling sorry over themselves for it. Brett DID sometimes seem a bit hard toward Sarah, but I found it understandable when he often took his bad memories out on her, as Sarah often seemed a recreation of his wife who he hated. The love scenes were a bit boring and hard to understand, but I do lightly recommend this book. But only lightly.Cyndi"
4,Great Rasta hat but small,"i recieved my hat earlier than expected wich is always a good thing, but it was very small but you will be able to streatch it out over time. i would reccomend"
3,Black,"Make sure you realize you will not be getting the hat in the picture! It's black, which I now notice it says in the description, so that was mostly my fault.Also, it's kind of small."
1,Terrible DVD-Babylon Culture Reggae Street Wars,"I love Reggae and I have what I would describe as a descent collection. This DVD is not only awful but annoyingly terrible.The people that produced this item either have no good taste or have a sad sense of humor. I have never seen anything, in my whole life, as terrible. I asked to return it immediately. Complete waste of time and useful energy."
3,Not quite what I expected,"My opinion might not be quite fair because I was not going through the whole book but looked up (proofed) some ""high yield"" topics instead, usually important for the board exam. One example is ""typical pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis"" and I could not find the right info. That's why I sent this book back. My experience with the ABIM Exam is that you not only have to have the right amount of facts handy but also be able to differentiate between very similiar disease presentations, and that all in very short time. This is a tricky situation, especially for non native speakers (I am german). For board exam preparation you need a book that focuses exactly on these factors and at the same time giving you the right amount of facts . As far as I can tell the MKSAP and the MedStudy IM Board Review are the only ones that can give you that. Both about 400$ each!"
3,Storm Front,"For A First Time Author, This Book Wasn't Half Bad. I Didn't Like How He Had Put It In A First Person View The Entire Book, And It Seemed All He Did Was Run Around With His Brian Turned Off. Would I Recommend, If Your Bored Then Yes, Otherwise Don't Bother."
3,Hope the series gets better,"A quick, disposable adventure written in the style of classic noir. It's not quite a mystery because Harry knows early on who the bad guy is. He simply cannot get to the bad guy because of all the personal entanglements. Unfortunately, it's not quite a fantasy either because the magical world in which Harry lives has no real texture or depth. Magic is just another investigative tool. I hope the series gets better, and I'm already reading the second installment ('Fool Moon'), but so far this is one big ""meh."""
4,Good fantasy book,"This is the first book of a good fantasy series, set in current/this world US. The hero is a wizard/private investigator called Harry Dresden who seems to to stick his nose in things usually larger and more dangerous than what he can possibly handle but still usually comes out bruised-but-victorious in the end. Peppered with good humor the interestingly woven action-packed storyline and gradually built up characters make this book easy and enjoyable to read. As for me, I'm looking forward to check out the next book in the series.On a side note, a TV series (Dresden Files) was based mostly on this one book."
4,Very Good Book,"This is the first in Butcher's ""Dresden Files"" series. From some of the more negative reviews here, I was a bit worried about it. Fortunately, I found the book more in line with the positive reviews: the writing, characters, and plot are all very good. My only complaints are that 1) Butcher only hints at the magic system and the world behind it, and 2) in one scene in his office (near the end), the number of errors Dresden makes just becomes silly. But, as other reviewers have noted, this is not high literature. For a dark, fantasy/gumshoe mixture, it's very good and is definitely worth reading. As such, I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5."
3,Not the best of the bunch.,"I don`t really know why, but I could not get into this book. Compared to the later of the Dresden Files, this one just lacked in plot. However, I am bias. I read Fool Moon, Blood Rites, and Summer Knight before I finally read the Storm Front.Storm Front is more or less a stand alone story. In other words: you can skip it if you want to. My suggestion would be to read one of the other books and come back to this one."
2,"Full Of Possibilities, But.......",I really wanted to like this book. The premise is great and Harry's impudent observations are very funny. But the plot soon plummets into a bad TV script that makes blood-letting and heart-ripping boring. Peopled with some boring characters and hackneyed situations. Even the interesting characters couldn't save this one.
4,I love this series.....so far,"Harry is cool - he has got the smart mouth in tense situations that I totally love and pretty much conduct my life. I relate to this persons code of conduct.The beginning of this book drags just a bit and come about page 50 or 60 this book kicks into high gear. Harry uses information from a fairy he captures and the wizardry begins. Harry captures all the supernatural snafu stuff that your looking for. I loved the way he explained that magic and spells has many things to do with emotions and the way you feel. I love Harry he may be a wizard and capable of many things but he also is human and feels many of the same things that us boring mortals go through (love life, lack of money, unpaid bills and owned by a cat with an attitude)Keep up the good work Mr. Butcher."
3,Not bad entertaining fun read,First book read of Dresden files enjoyed book and will probably check out a few more in the series. Kindle price kind of high...easier to go pick up the paperback at a used book store.
3,Gumshoe Wizard,"Originally a fan of the tv show, I picked up this novel after learning it had been canceled. You'll find in the books Harry is darker and a bit more chauvinistic. It didn't really impact my enjoyment of the story, but it's worth noting.The mystery is better than those typically in the tv series. More fleshed out, better staged. Butcher's writing is very utilitarian which makes for an easy read.The novel isn't a perfect blend of fantasy elements with murder mystery - those familiar to both genres will easily suss out the mystery early on, but it doesn't pass itself off as the greatest mystery or fantasy novel either so it works.I preferred the more lighthearted and amusing Harry in the tv series, and I'm hoping he'll lighten up as the novels progress. I certainly was entertained enough by the novel to continue with the series, whether his emo tendencies abate a bit or not."
4,Excellent SciFi Fantasy and Mystery,"This book was a quick-read that kept me engrossed for the entire story; the characters are multi-faceted, and Dresden is a subdued hero. This is a quality book that you don't want to end, so you move onto the next book in the series with the anticipation that it, too, will draw you in (and it does)."
1,This book and the series is awesome - Penguin Publishing Sucks,"I love this book and the series.What I do not love is the price of this ebook. I'm pissed at this stupid ebook pricing structure in general but this book just caused me particular pricing pain.Here is a book that I enjoy. I owned a physical copy years ago. When I bought a Kindle and decided to re-read the series I re-purchased this book for $6.39. I was pleased and happy.Today a friend was looking for a new series to read so I redirected him here and he came back with ""Woah $9 for a book from 10 years ago"". He is right, the pricing is stupid. Especially the price increase from $6.39 to $9.99. Distributing the ebook did not become more expensive for Amazon (free of charge to the publisher) over the last year.Not Jim Butchers fault. Not even Amazon's fault. The blame for this stupidity and the 1 star review can be placed on Penguin Publishing."
4,Much better than the TV series,"I really enjoyed this book, if you have been watching the series on TV, you will really like this book."
5,Great book!,"I really enjoyed the TV series, and my husband recently bought this book for me not realizing that the show was based on it. Really great book & a fun read. Even better than the series. I just ordered the rest of the books in the series and can't wait to read 'em!"
4,fun read,"really liked it ,I will buy more books in this series I really had a good time was alot of fun"
3,"Harry Potter, Chicago Private eye...","Curious to find out who or what The Dresden Files were all about (after watching the frustratingly dull Sci-Fi channel series) I read this first book and entered Jim Butcher's world of warlocks, vampires, and all things weird. It almost plays out like a Harry Potter grown old and jaded, forced to ply his trade as a cheap detective in modern day, noirish Chicago. This initial endeavor is good. Not great but readable in a rushed sort of way. You get the feel for the possibilities.If only the writing were a bit more careful, a bit more thoughtful...As it stands, I suggest you read this and see if you get the magic or the noir; at the very least you will enjoy the Sci-Fi series a lot more..."
2,This book is better suited for a child between the ages of 10-13. Very short. Little detail.,I was disappointed in this book. It could have been a 200 page book had the font and margins been typical. Short. Lame... Just really a kids book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with a college education. Possibly even a high school education.
2,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I was excited to play this game with the kids. Like the other reviews say, it is a good idea poorly executed. MOST of the questions are completely ambiguous and could possibly have more than one answer. Our 12 year old smoked us because the ""kids"" questions were suitable for 6 year olds. Some of the questions were just flat incorrect. Ive never heard of the company Spin Master before who makes the game but I won't purchase from them again"
5,Good items at good price,"I bought two pair of these to get free shipping. The rust preventer coating was easily removed with soap and water. Came out shiny clean. I am not looking for high precision, just some blocks that are square and these fit my needs in model airplane building. Totally happy with the product and my purchase.Yes, the shipping box was flimsy for something this heavy and arrived quite beat up, but the blocks were not damaged."
3,Gets the job done,"I tested these with and indicator and there is quite a bit of variance in height throughout the blocks. It did hold to within .0004"". Fine for most average machining, but not high-precision work."
3,"Great watch for what it is, will be too chunky for some","I ordered this watch after all the great reviews (it is also one of the best selling watches of the year), but was disappointed with the bulkiness of it. My mom would love this watch, but not my wife, who is 25. So make sure your significant other really likes Rolex chunky style watches before buying. This watch is not for everyone!"
2,Not so Great,"Purchased as a gift and have had nothing but complaints and issues with this watch. I would not buy it again or recommend it, the quality is just not there."
5,Joy joy,The watch is beautiful it looks more expensive then what I paid for it ...Because of your lower prices I was able to buy it ..I've gotten so many compliments...I would highly recommended this watch to anyone...tks. Amazon :D
4,Bulova Diamond Chronograph Watch,"I saw this watch in a magazine and fell in love with it. Rather than paying full retail price for it, I went online to Amazon.com and found it for hundreds less. I loved the watch when it arrived but I am a petite person and this watch is heavy and a bit too large for my frame. I was sad to return it. My advise is to go to a retailer and try it on first before ordering online."
2,watch stopped working after 4 months,"The watch looks a lot better in the picture,but is far from what it looks,more over after 4 months it just stopped,now I cant contact the seller,is no where to be found.."
1,There is NOTHING NEW in this new book,"When this book was first published in 1996 (see ISBN 978-1885254139) it was quite special, because so few things had been published in English on Adolf Loos. However in 2009 -- this is merely a marketing ploy .... same book, even the same OLD photos, now just more expensive. Since the 1996 publication .. the Müller house has been completely restored, and lots of new material has come to light. If you want this book ... buy a used copy of the original (ISBN noted above). otherwise check out the 2007 publication by SKIRA (ISBN: 978-8876246432)."
5,a book to keep close by at all times,"This book is a must for anyone who is remotely intersted in information on the unitarian universalist church. It is very welcoming to anyone who reads it, especially those of us who have left organized religion in the past and felt there would never be any turning back. The book compares and contrasts the UU church to other western religions as well as eastern in a non biased way. It really gives the reader something concrete and tangible regarding the beliefs of the church. It is written on my level in the sense that there is no condescention or judgement. I knew I would like it from the first page. What a pleasure to find a book that helps answer my questions on liberal faith! It is the kind of book I will always keep at my beside for rereading and reviewing."
4,Good for the price,This Soprano is not my favorite. Although she does have the early music sound. I prefer a little less strident straight tone and a little more vibrato in a high soprano's singing. She does tend to be a little flat due to this. But not many options for this recording for around this price. So I'll deal.
3,"An Interesting Everest Account, but Hyper-critical","I enjoyed Kropp's story very much ~ I always find it fascinating to read about these type of experiences and about explorers who have such a fascinating drive to go to such extremes to attain their goals. Kropp's story is a unique one in that he sets SUCH high aspirations for himself (bicycle with no help from Sweden to climb Everest, then bicycle back again) then is maniacally headstrong about following through on his goals.Although I enjoyed his account, I was quite put off by his criticism of others and his opinions of what they were doing ""wrong."" And he had a LOT of opinions. It's his book and he can say whatever he want, however, it is just my feeling that this book would have benefited from Kropp staying with HIS story and HIS experiences and not veer off every other chapter to rag on others."
2,What's Kropp's problem?,David Lagercrantz should get more credit for writing this book. I am basing this on the information I read on page 220. The book is a bit heavy handed. Kropp seems like an arrogant person. He had no business talking about how bad another climber's English was especially when he had to enlist help to write this book. Kropp's lack of morals as depicted in the book proves anyone determined enough can climb a mountain. It was interesting only because the protagonist was going somewhere. Endangering one's life just to climb a mountain is stupid.
3,"Great Anime, but not the same product.","I just received this DVD today and the first thing I noticed was that the box set that I received is different than what is shown. The entire box art is completely different and instead of having 625 minutes, it only has 600. My best guess is that Funimation changed the box art and everything recently. I cannot seem to find any information about them changing it though. On my cover it has each of the host club members with different facial expressions. However, this anime does have great quality, story, and humor. It would definitely give 5 stars if it wasn't for the different box set. The only reason I am giving this product three stars is because it is not what I was expecting. If this is the newer version, I am slightly happy though because it doesn't look nearly as gay as the pink one (haha). I may post a picture of the box set I got later. I am also debating returning it as I am not sure if this is a legit release or what."
2,"Great Anime, Poor Condition DVDs","I can't even begin to say how much I love this show. Read the other comments to find out just how good, funny, and great it is.My only concern with it is I just got mine in the mail today (after being two days after the expected delivery date) and the first disc was cracked, as if it was pushed into the container really hard. It skips when it plays on my computer, luckilly the DVD Player plays it well. But...yeah. Buyer beware."
2,Great show unreadable subtitles,Whose idea was it to use white subtitles on a show that is mostly bright colors? Funimation that's who. My Eyesight is pretty bad but even if I Could see these white subtitles would be impossible to read. I've complained to funimation about this before but I guess my complaints have fallen on deaf ears.Everyone else in the world uses Yellow subtitles. Why not funimation? WHY NOT?You're better off with fansubs.That said the Blu ray transfer is a good one and the show it self is good from what I can gather. But the subtitles make this show almost unwatchable and I refuse to watch dubbed.
1,Funmation messed up again,"I just love this anime but the bluray version sucks. Funimation came out with this Ouran High bluray a while ago (2 yrs ago)and just recently (May-June 2012)re-released this anime set again, but they still have not fixed the issues with this re-release. What happened Funimation this is the worst bluray ever!!Cons:Bluray Picture quality looks worse than my non-bluray versionwidescreen is not available (cannot change picture size so this anime will never fill you screen)Pros:If you can get over the cons it is a great story with lots of laughs"
1,order canceled by company so they could up the shipping charge!,"I order this item 2 days ago and was going to pay 5.95 for shipping and today (monday)i got an email that my order was canceled and when i went to find out why ,relized they jacked up the shipping to 12.95!! I will not be shopping with this company again!!"
3,"Fast, easy, but not reliable","Mine lasted for a year and four months before it suddenly died. That's not a good lifetime for a hard disk these days, normal disks run five years without noticeable errors. Two points off for poor quality. Still it's better than my One Touch 250 GB, which lasted only months. I think that's a pretty good hint that Maxtor doesn't build these disks to last.While it works, though, it is pretty much foolproof. (Unless you're foolish enough to drop it, I guess. Never tried that.) Easy to set up, easy to use. Faster than tape. If all you need is a backup device or a way to move data from one computer to another, it is very good... while it lasts. Try to get an extended warranty or service plan, though."
2,Good for a while...,"I've used several of these for external backups at my place of business. The price is reasonable, and while they're working, they're great. Unfortunately, I've had a grand total of FOUR of these units die on me. They tend to last around a year or less, then they're toast.I've gone to a either building my own - you can buy a usb 2.0 case and a regular hard drive for cheaper than you can buy this unit, or in some cases another, more reliable vendor."
5,Elegant,"Everybody loves my Talavera switch plates. They blend perfectly at my modern, yet traditional, apartment."
5,a brilliantly innovative writer!,I can't think of another writer who can capture so much of a woman's inner life in so few words. There's really no one else you can compare her to; the work is entirely original. You have to read it for yourself!--Dawn Raffel
4,Well built mower,"I wanted a Zero-Turn mower for quite some time. I shopped, I read review after review and finally chose this one. I wanted to buy local but I couldn't beat the price at amazon, especially with the free shipping. As far as the mower goes,it is well-built with heavy gauge steel, fairly comfortable, and powerful. The only complaint I have is it rides a little rough(which may be the case with most zero-turn mowers). The front tires are a very hard rubber and you can't let any air out of them or you will break the seal and lose it all and they are hard to re-inflate. It does do a great job of mowing and does it in a shorter time than a regular riding mower."
1,Sunbeam Steam Iron,This is the worse steam iron I have ever owned. From the very beginning it leaked. It was very slow to heat up and very difficult to fill with water. I ended up throwing it out and buying a different brand which I am very satisfied with.
5,Great Iron!,"Very easy, you can see your water level, and it turns itself off should you forget. It's a little heavier than my old iron, but overall I love it. Great burst of steam feature and a nice even spray when you use the water spray. Best iron I've ever had."
1,Not the product pictured or described- doesn't have non stick sole plate,The product I received is not the same as the one pictured and does not have a nonstick sole plate.
1,"Poor temperature control, no steam, and sticky plate","Don't buy the Sunbeam 4238!!!!!!After using a Philips steam iron for 12 years, we decided to try this as it had good reviews. Urgh...the steaming function didn't work (it would self-clean and burst, but not steam when ironing). On top of that fault, this is a heavy, sticky iron. More seriously, the digital temperature control only has five settings, so you can't fine tune the temperature (no setting for light cotton, for instance).To add insult to injury, when I tried to call Customer Service, after 10 minutes of prompts, I was terminated with ""Lines are too busy, try again later"" !!!"
4,Met my expectations....,"After looking through several choices for a tv that would work in a smaller room or bedroom I chose this one. Compared to the other tv's at this size (20"") it has features that few others do. I noticed a lot of complaints about text being fuzzy or ""off"" and the tv having ""warm"" red colors. I've had the tv for several months now and i never noticed these complaints. Maybe i'am not as critical as others are, but for $160 I feel like I got a deal.One other note I would like to mention:I believe I ordered from a site that went through amazon.com (used and new section), I did not bother them about it but when i recieved the tv I noticed a small, almost unnoticeable dent in the top middle. I believe it was made by the shipping company but it looks like a lot of weight went into making it because the plastic is hard. Not enough for me to send it back although I wondered how i got it so cheap..."
1,im 12 and.....,I boguth all the my scenes but i like the bratz better i mean the bratz clothes and their heads are a lot more detailed. i bought the two bratz hollywood and i asked my friends wich one they like the best they all said the...........Bratz so dont bother get this toy is is stupid and the hair frizzed on me
5,"""EMI"" Hollywood Nolee",My Favorite Doll Is Nolee BecauseShe Is So Beautiful And I Love Her Fashions.I Don't Have This One Yet But She Looks Beautiful.
4,A Useful Book in Understanding Shakespeare!,"Dr. Maurice Charney is the alternative to Dr. Harold Bloom in the literary understanding and criticism of William Shakespeare. This short book offers insights without being too technical or too detailed. Dr. Charney is equally capable as Dr. Bloom in analyzing William Shakespeare without being intimidating. Although both Bloom and Charney try not to be intimidating to their reading audience. If you are literary buff like myself, it is good to have two different literary critics for any author particularly William Shakespeare."
5,Power Rangers Zeo Quest,"Great movie about when the rangers go on a quest to look for the zeo subcrystal for new powers.On Aishas quest she gives her place to a girl named Tanya.After their journey is over they retreat back to the command center and their age is restored and eveything is back to normal until,Rito and Goldar appear in the command center and steal the zeo crystals.Then the command center is shut down but the power chamber is built.Then the rangers get new powers with Tommy the red Adam the green Rocky the blue Tanya the yellow and Kat the pink and new enemies too!"
4,Cordless DEsktop S510,Easy to install.Simple to use.Worth the money.Negative no instruction book. No way to find out how to program the special keys.Logitech no help.Gave me max work space.Good investment
5,Fully Recommended,"Great keyboard and mouse. Have been using them for close to 2 months now. The mouse is amazing, works on all surfaces, flat or not! Way to go, Logitech!"
1,Can't get it to work,"Purchased this at the local Circuit City thinking $40 after rebate. Got it home and could not install it. I'm not a computer expert but rate my knowledge above average. I followed the instructions on the brochure provided to the letter without success. I connected it to my PC in every way immaginable including the green and purple connections, UBS connection to each of the USB ports, changing the batteries etc. I am returning it tomorrow.I use a two year old Dell laptop at my office. It has two ports in the rear of the machine. I use a Logi Elite Cordless Duo for it. If I mistakely plug my Logi connection in the top USB port instead of the bottom one, I have to uninstall and reinstall the software completely. I will never buy another Logitech product. I will buy Microsoft, Fellowes, Belkin, etc. etc. but not Logitech."
3,Ok Keyboard...disappointing mouse,"The range on the wireless keyboard and mouse isn't as long as I'd like, but it just barely works where I need it to in my living room. I like the keyboard and the extra functions it provides, but the mouse is as basic as a mouse from 8 years ago. No extra buttons for forward and back which I have on my two other Logitech mice. I think this would be great combo with a better mouse."
3,I EXPECTED BETTER PRODUCT,"The product is not like I thought. The keyboard has the insert key far away the delete,home,pgdwn,pgup keys. No led indicator when keyboard is in use.Better: mouse is operative on any surface."
3,Logitech Cordless Desktop S510,The keyboard is a delight. It is fast...no delay...no hesitation. I am very pleased with it. The mouse is a different story. It is hesitant and jerky. It stops a half inch from a target and cannot be pushed further until the mouse is lifted and wiped. Never saw anything like it before. I bought two keyboards and two mice at the same time. Both mice do the same thing.
5,Perfect timing,"I was very excited about this purchase because my boyfriend has been missing his favorite cologne, he couldnt find it in department stores around here...so when I found it and got it for his birthday it made everyone happy"
5,toothbrush holder,The toothbrush holder came in good time and we were pleased with the product as described.
4,A whole book about one state-wide election?,"Yes, and it was almost as compelling as Vol. 1, Path to Power, which was breathtaking in its coverage of LBJ's Texas Hill Country and his first 35 years. I read Vol 1 in 1992 and could not put it down. Breathless when I got to the last page, I thought it better to read something else for a while. (Go figure.) It took eight years to get back to Vol 2. The tale of the 1948 election is dark and depressing--are U.S. elections still so corrupt?--and leaves one wondering from where does LBJ pull the intelligence and charm he needed to accomplish what he did during his presidency. I trust Robert Caro will have strong opinions on that in his next volume."
1,Cut-Off tool,"The first time I tried to use this product I plugged it up to the air and it immediately started rotating, it started rotating so fast it slung the blade off, something with the trigger mechanism is messed up and it is brand new. I do not advise for anyone to buy this product."
4,Protects carpets from family members,"Who walks on carpet the most? Family members. I keep these right at the door where the carpeted area begins. Family members coming from outside who have been messing around in the yard know to put these on before walking on the new carpet. The XL size becomes a one-size-fits all. If the covers are not too soiled, they can be thrown in the washer on the gentlest cycle and be reused."
2,"Good to have it, but ....","This book is jsut a compilation of quotations in order to prove his points. It is good to have it because I see a different point to view. However, I would not buy any book written by him next time. Although I understand his arguments and agree with some points in the book, the style of his writing is very poor. My former English teacher would give D to a term paper written in this manner. Just too many quoations. Why doesn't he write in his own words when he refers to somebody else?"
4,beautiful book,Beautiful book! Only wish it had some more options as to what shapes you are looking for. My son was totally familiar with the book after 2 or 3 readings so we make up other shapes to look for. But still loved it!
2,One Side of the Story,"Scott Maruna is a nice man and welcome to his views. For anyone wishing to read the case against the reality of the 'mad gasser' I refer them to several books by Dr. Robert E. Bartholomew including Hoaxes, Myths & Manias: Why We Need Critical Thinking, and The Southern Medical Journal 92(8):762-769 (1999)."
4,My Man Abe!,"Great book. However, I wish the ENTIRE ""farewell speech"" (leaving Springfield going to DC as president elect)was included. In the book, it is only a partial speech. The same can be said herein for the Gettysburg Address. How can this great, outstanding speech be limited to three brief lines? Both should always be written in its entirety. Always. No half measures even if this is a ""thrift edition."" It does Lincoln no great service and neither the readers!"
2,Guts spilling all over...,Superficial treatment of subjects. Tired examples (How many times can we read about Southwest & SAS?). Very little new or inspiring in this book. Two thumbs down.
1,This thing is crap,This thing is a piece of cheap crap!! Don't waste your money as it does not even work. It came out of the box as a piece of cheap plastic set at 70 degrees and it never changed. I left it in the tank for a few days and the temp gauge never changed. I would never buy again.
5,Innovative Text,"The Al-Kitaab books use a truly outstanding and innovative approach to the teaching of the Arabic Language. The grammatical explanations are clear and concise, texts used are varied in content and address relevant cultural and social issues in the Arab world, and the vocabulary used in the lessons is widely useful. I recommend this series very enthusiastically."
1,Could I have my money back !,"This book has wasted both my time and money. The only good thing I can say about it, is that it comes with a CD containing SS with 60 days license."
2,"Might be OK, but wrong hub diameter makes it useless","Got this to replace a faulty wheel on Rubbermaid carts (one of the most common out there).Rubbermaid had a .625"" diameter axle. The hub on this is .500"". Just would not work. Suggest that this spec be highlighted in the description.I returned this for a refund, but of course the return shipping costs were about the same as what I got refunded. Not blaming Northern Industrial, but the only winner here is UPS. They got everyone's money."
5,Good Price,I have to take these for heartburn. They are what my doctor prescribed.The price is one of the best I have gotten.
5,Avoid stomach pain,"It's great to have Zantac in my medicine cabinet. Knowing that I can head off stomach aches with one pill is such a good feeling, I bet the stress reduction alone helps me avoid stomach issues. So does the price from Amazon. VERY soothing."
4,beautiful,"I was disappointed it was only a 2 disc set, although we did enjoy watching the series. That's why we wanted more discs - to see more of Life in the Undergrowth."
5,Great narration and amazing photography,I purchased this DVD for my teenage sons who really enjoyed watching Planet Earth. Myself and my sons absolutely enjoyed this DVD. As always Sir David Attenborough's narration complements the outstanding photography. My only regret is I wish I could have purchased this DVD on blu-ray.
4,just another review,"My son LOVED this DVD. Though the ""quality"" of the DVD is not as good as Planet Earth or Blue Plannet, it is not bad. I think it is so cool how they were able to record the small creatures using special camaras. Over all, it is very enjoyable and educational. Good product and I would recommend it."
1,unable to know the songs on this album,"I'm trying to find one song that according to my mom the tittle is GOLONDRINAS, there is any way someone could help me finding on which album I would find it?She is an old fan of Julio Jaramillo and I would love to buy it for her."
3,"he's no bill cosby, but..","I liked this cd a lot. The End Of The Universe skit is hilarious. My only gripe, and don't call me a pu**y for saying this, is that he swears too much. I have no problem with swearing, it's just he uses it so much sometimes, it gets annoying. Instead of being part of his act, the whole angry thing becomes his act. At times, it's just annoying. He could easily get across the same jokes without yelling and saying fu*k every two words. Some of this jokes are hilarious while some really aren't that funny. They're observations that we all make, he just yells them."
2,I laughed out loud....once.,"Some of these reviews call this his best stuff, and a top performance. I'd say of the 14 comedy albums I own it's my 14th favorite. What's wrong? It's just not that funny.Lewis is one of those comics that's really wound. He gets all riled up about things. Pissed at this, pissed at that, F this, F that. I like some good cussing, but I think he used the F word 230 times. Loses it's shock value after about 5. But like I have said, he's mad, but the jokes and real humor is just not there. There's almost no wit. It's all observational. He's like an older and angrier Dane Cook.Now I don't mean to say I hate this album, or I don't like Lewis Black. There's just so many others I'd rather hear first. Like.....everybody."
5,Sophisticated fragrance for men,"This is medium bodied mens fragrance with mixed notes of wood, citrus, and a hint of floral. Not for men who wear BRUT or Aqua Velva. This is best used as an evening or winter fragrance. This is an upscale fragrance that lasts, yet not overpowering by any means."
2,"Works, but poor efficiency","The construction is solid which is nice when you're dealing with very hot pots of boiling liquid. Unfortunately, the control does not allow for a very precise adjustment of propane flow and thus causes yellow tipped flames (i.e. inefficient and good primarily just for making your pots black) in an open garage. In full outdoors, the flame is difficult to keep consistent and re-lighting is often necessary meaning you have to babysit the device. Perhaps keeping this in your emergency kit is a good idea, but using frequently for grilling or cooking outdoors is not recommended."
5,works for my nails,"I bought this especially for my nails. I made the dreadful mistake of getting a no chip manicure last year and it damaged my nails so badly that as my nails grew, they peeled to the quick. This is the ONLY thing that brought my nails back. I would pay three times more for this product, because I can be proud of my nails again."
1,false advertising,"not only did this product show up late, it is not like the picture unless your some sort of midget.from the picture, it looks like 16 inches wide and 30 inches long, when i received it, it was made for a child.it doesnt look like the picture nor looks like the size of the picture, this is the worse product i ever purchased from everlast, the quality has gone down for this company, shows they are using child labor or over seas workers to make their horrid products."
2,Not the Superbowl,"I rented this DVD so I could finally watch the game that I missed a year ago, which my parents were supposed to tape for me but they didn't. I was severely disappointed because it only shows a few highlights and not the whole game. I need to find a copy of the whole game somewhere so I can finally watch it. I've been a Steeler fan for 28 years, and this was a long time in coming. I didn't see it because I don't watch television on the Lord's Day. There are more important things to do on that day."
1,Total Rip-off,"Doesn't reduce odors and gets in the way during removal of the bags from Simple Human cans. Once placed, can't be moved and the sticky stuff leaves a big whitish spot of gunk in the can. Skip it and change your garbage bag, cat litter, or whatever more frequently."
2,Boring yet somewhat interesting,"It was a very very boring book that put me to sleep every time I picked it up to read. Yes it did have some interesting things in it, it was more boring than it was interesting."
5,Great series!,"I purchased this set for my mother. I got her the complete first and second season for Christmas of 2005, and this was her Christmas gift this year. I'm planning on getting her season 4 for her birthday. She knows every episode by heart. I'm so glad they've come out with the DVD's because they usually only show them during the day around here, so she never gets to see them. Again, this is a wonderful family show. A great way to show children the values that should be as important today as they were in the Great Depression."
1,not happy with service,I received a large hernia belt a few days after i ordered it. I did not open it but i noticed on the outside of the box it said: large 40 - 46. my waist size is 35. I sent the unopened package back two weeks ago and i have not received the other one. If someone reads this at Amazon please advise. c c smith
2,I paint what I see,"Good cartoons that I remember- they are a little bit outdated for this time, so many people will not be impressed now withthe internet ."
3,"Show is great, DVD quality: not so good","I bought ""Alice"" as a gift for my Brazilian fiancée. She absolutely loved the show up to the 3rd disk. Unfortunately the 3rd episode wouldn't play on any of my DVD players, and the 4th disk wouldn't play at all.I hope soon we will be able to enjoy the last part of the show.Other than the technical difficulties, the series was a good watch. It isn't always easy to find movies and such in Portuguese and My fiancée loves it when I do."
4,Good insights on the competitive advantage of nations.,Great insights on competitive advantage. A must for every serious student of economics and management. An important addition to my business collection as an Academician.
5,2 stars,"I give the 2 stars based on the amount of time it took for the item to get to me. I order the item and it took almost two and a half weeks to get to me, in my eyes that is entirely too long. The only good thing was that it was a good price and it was the correct item."
1,Worst Book Ever,This was the worst book I have ever read. I would have given it away but didn't want to be the one held accountable for wasting someone else's time. It went into the trash the second after I finished reading. Look elsewhere!
4,Brilliant Hollywood Portrait,"This sequel to The Player follows in the tradition of such 19th century novelists as Dostoevsky or George Eliot, as Michael Tolkin fashions a dead-on moral tale of the high-end lives of the Hollywood rich and powerful. Griffin Mill is back. He's 52 now, and down to his last $6 million, he's almost broke. Carrying a guilty secret, he's still capable of ruthlessly doing what is necessary to get ahead. Tolkin is a terrific writer. This book isn't just about Hollywood. It shows us what's rotten about money-lusting America."
3,The Player Has Left the Building,"I did not read The Player but really enjoyed the movie. So, based upon the great newspaper write-ups I anxiously awaited this book. Griffin is down to his last $6 million as a studio executive with an unhappy 40ish trophy wife when he realizes his executive days may be over. Somehow the initiative to donate $750,000 to be close to a near billionaire works and suddenly his strange journey begins. But under weird circumstances and is there another murder in his closet?What starts as a Hollywood whodunit converts to a philisopical journey to a dead end. Does Griffin once again win out to higher stakes? And how about this mess of a family? Read this book at your own risk. The pace and set-up is excellent and then it drops into the abyss with minor peaks and not enough action to make it worth the read.Loved The Player. Trust me, The Player has NOT returned."
5,Bring Some Passion Home Tonight,"Passion Parties President ""Pat Davis"" had written a book couples can enjoy together. From setting the Mood to Foreplay, from Playful moments to a Sensual Diva. This book is tasteful yet, loaded with great ideas to enhance our relationships."
4,Well Written Book about Key Battle,"Tannenberg 1914 by John Sweetman is a well written book describing one of the key battles of the First World War. In 1914 Russia and France had entered into an alliance which compelled Russia to launch offensive military operations soon after Germany began the war in the West. The purpose of Russia's offensive was to take pressure off the Western Front, give France some breathing room and force the Axis to fight a two front war.While Sweetman questions the military significance of Tannenberg, he does a marvelous job describing the battle and how a German force, half the size of its Russian counterpart, could have destroyed one Russian army and severely crippled another. Sweetman writes well and gives the reader a good sense of hows, whys and wherefores. This is a book that is well worth reading especially since there has been a dearth of writings about the Eastern Front."
2,Problems w Large Files,"I have had a real problem with this drive. It crashes when trying to write a large file to it - like a back up of my PC. That's what I'd gotten it for. I previously had a Maxtor One Touch w Firewire and liked it quite a lot when it was working. When that drive died (Hmmm - not the greatest experience, actually) I picked up this One Touch II. Going by my reading on the web, there is a problem with the chips used where by the buffer inside the drive overflow (or something along those lines). Maxtor offers a program on their web site for the Fire Wire version to flash those bios but not for the USB version.I also verified that it had this problem on another machine."
2,Questionable product?,I have purchased 2 of these products recently and both have failed within 2 months. Sure Amazon and Maxtor have replaced the units but I have had to pay the shipping and have had the trouble to be without them for several weeks. Cannot Maxtor do better than this? I think I will recosider before buying another Maxtor product. I guess that I just assumed that all Maxtor products were top quality but I was wrong. Please do your research better than I did.
1,Maxtor one touch,"Purchased a 300 gig system 7 months ago, since then I have lost data 4 times. This system is not worth the aggravation or the price. Thankfully I specialize in Data forensics and was able to recover what was lost. Save your money, purchase a LACIE they seem to take extreme abuse (I know, I have been on location in Iraq for 4 years)extreme temps etc. I expected more from Maxtor"
1,Buyer Beware,"Even after following the directions to fill the steamer below the max line, it still spit out boiling hot water dangerously."
2,extremely unimpressed,"I am returning this product. It just doesn't work like I expected it to. The steam gently floats out, no force to it at all. We tried steaming a shirt and i don't think it made a difference on the wrinkles. The cord is very short and steam lasts for a very short while."
1,Bad product,"The design of this steamer is dumb. It doesn't even have an on/off button and the electric cord isn't very long. I had to plug it into a power strip so I could easily turn it on and off without having to plug and unplug it every time. It worked well for the first few months, but then started leaking water out of the plastic sides or bottom, so water would be leaked out on any surface it was placed. I know this steamer is inexpensive, but I expected it to last longer than a few months."
1,I would hesitate to buy this.,"I wanted to steam iron linen shirts to keep that sightly wrinkled appearance they have when first bought. A regular iron would not do the trick, so I opted for this handheld steamer. It makes no impression on linen wrinkles at all. I regret buying it and am relieved that it was cheap, though I paid through the nose for shipping!"
1,Limited usefulness,"I have only used this twice now, and both times I filled it with water below the maximum line. Unless you only put about half the water in that is indicated by the maximum line, it spews water badly. I was careful to hold it horizontally as the instructions suggest. Because you can only put in such a limited amount of water, you have very little functional time. For that short time, it works okay, but you better work quickly. I am disappointed in this product."
4,very handy,This steamer is pretty efficient.. it does the job. I would suggest only using it for fast steaming on shirts mostly. the water runs out pretty fast.. you can do up to two shirts and then have to reload water.. for the price its perfect . I was impressed.
4,It works fine,"This is my first steamer, so I have little to compare it to. I like having a way to get wrinkles out that doesn't involve an iron. It meets my needs, especially with sweaters and slacks. I don't think it completely replaces an iron, which is what I was originally hoping. Iron still works best for some items, like men's business shirts."
2,bulky cord too heavy and inflexable,it makes steam; not a lont of it.bulky item and the cord is not good at all.too thick. needs to be flexible and is not.hard to use.i would not purchase again. should have returned it.
2,Decent Steamer,"I read the reviews and head this was a good product. After receiving the steamer, I quickly put it to the test, as I had a few wrinkled items I needed to steam. The steamer did work quickly, however, it was not that great at getting the wrinkles out. So it a decent product, but it's better for a quick steam rather than a really wrinkled item."
1,Not compact at all--Do not buy for travel,"I bought this steamer and it's not even vaguely compact. You cannot use it for travelling because it's much too large. The word ""compact"" should not even be in the title of this product. It's a large steamer with an industrial size cord."
4,Great Product,"I don't like to iron if I don't have to because there are so many steps involved and takes up so much time and energy. But I was running into the problem of wanting to wear clothes and having no time to iron or straighten out the fabric. So I bought this product for those times. It heats up so quick, and starts steaming right away. It straightens out the fabric so quickly and so well. I used it on a scrub top, nurse uniform,that were wrinkled all over, especially at the v-neck and this product's steam took those away in less than a minute after steaming up.I recommend this product."
1,choose another steamer,"This steamer works ok, but after only a couple of uses, the bottom of the steamer is coated with rust & mold. Gross. There's no way to get in and clean that area of the appliance. I wish I could return it."
4,Works ok.,"Several years ago I did online research for a steamer and heard this was the best. This was before all the new steamer products exploded onto the market. It works ok, but leaves wet spots on clothes, so be sure to allow time for clothes to dry before wearing."
3,steamer is really good But..............,"I like this steamer...But there is not a button to turn on & off switch. In my case, cab is a little bit difficult to open & close...However, steam is very strong...."
2,"Great short term, terrible long term",The steamer worked absolutely great the first few months but then started leaking and left water stains on my desk and floor. Now I need to buy another one.
3,Great for the price,Its not perfect. Sometimes water will build on the tip of the spout and get on your clothes unless you're mindful. Having said that it works fine. You just get what you pay for.
4,Need power button,"the product works as described, but one improvement needed for the product. It would be more user friendly if this product has a power button that allows to on/off during water refill."
5,I LOVE IT!,"I love this steamer! Totally worth it. There are no buttons if you were wondering, simply add water to the limit line labeled MAX. Plug in and 2 minutes later its steaming and ready to rock!!! Quick, fast, and easy, all the qualities you look for in a steamer. Just remember to follow there suggestions on how far you should steam form your garmet. It gets really hot. Totally worth it, and easy for traveling."
5,Great Steamer!!,"I bought this steamer to use on a cruise for my destination wedding to Key West. It fit perfectly in my bag, even a carry-on and I used it several times- cocktail dresses, suits, even my wedding dress! I would highly recommend this product and very well priced too!!"
1,Perfume smell!!,"I couldn't wait to try this lotion for my dry winter skin. After reading reviews I thought I made the right purchase . If you have sensitive skin, this lotion has a lot of perfume in it! I put it on my arms first to give it a try and had a migraine almost instantly. The smell of the perfume got on my clothes and was so hard to get rid of!I don't recommend this product at all! Gold bond and Burt's Bees is so much better."
2,Doesn't do justice,Only a few of the posters are shown in color! Grayscale doesn't do justice to these posters. I was disappointed in the book. I think it's just a catalog of an exhibit and one that doesn't stand alone as a book all that well.
5,nice leather,i bought two of these some years ago and wanted a couple more for a different room. They are great and have good storage.
4,Good but could be better,"I purchased this DVD and was happy about it. I knew already there were only 4 episodes but then I thought that it could of used a couple more of the episodes that were ""scary"". Like when Shawn and Gus went to the Fright Fest fairgrounds and witnessed a murder. That would of been good and also when the girl was supposedly possessed by the devil. All in all I really wished I hadn't bought this one. I could of used the money towards buying Season 6 and then completing my collection. But you can never have enough of Shawn and Gus !!!!!"
5,Absoulute sleeper...and you must have it.,"This is one of the most feel good, happy go lucky soundtracks I've ever heard. great mix of music and poems from Mike myers. Gotta have it!"
2,Didn't make it through...,"I started to read this book thinking it was entertaining enough but the writing was just too basic, story line unimaginitive for me to commit to.Other books in this category that at least deliver on good writing are worth my reading time."
5,Best Nirvana rare cd. Period,"I bought this cd because it is rare and i bought it for collection. I purchased this just for collection because i was planning on not using it because i had low doubts but man was i wrong. If you have a chance, get this. Get it for the Lithium 1st rehearsal, bambi slaughter and smells like teen spirit. It is a great cd for collectors and listeners.-Erik Rodriguez"
2,How about some self-control?,"I am a Gen-Xer who worked my way through college - both undergrad and grad school. It can be done without a huge debt. Draut should emphasize self-control and delayed gratification as without these qualities, the very people she writes about have amassed tremendous credit card debt which will keep them down for years. A sensible lifestyle will get you ahead - not more taxes on those of us who actually work. More handouts, such as Draut suggests, is not going to help the whiners. Give a person a fish..."
2,misses the larger picture,"I graduated the same year as the author. The two stars are for pointing out that those without university degrees are slipping further behind those who do, every decade since the 1960s.Yet Draut ignores the enormous benefits which many in their 20s and 30s will enjoy whie quite a few baby boomers will not. The most dramatic improvements will be in future health. Shifting 10 to 15 years into the future , we will see 40 and 50 year olds in 2015 or 2020 will never have to worry about obesity or a multidude of diseases including cancer.This is another in a long series of books which unconvincingly argues that ""things have been getting better and better...until now."""
2,This book regurgitates the obvious.,"If we go to college, we have to pay for it. Many people take loans to pay for their college education. When one graduates college, they must repay those loans. To pay back the loans, one must make money. To make money, one must get a job.College costs a lot. That sucks. Today's 20- and 30-somethings spend too much because they live in a society that is driven by the ""I NEED this"" and ""I NEED that"" just because the Jones' do.It's a vicious cycle.That's how I felt about the book -- it was very cyclical in that it seems to just keep repeating the same thing over and over again.I didn't get much out of the book. Someone could just write a one page summary of the book, read it, and they would save themselves the energy of wasting their time reading this book."
1,Not genuine kohler part,Ad said genuine kohler part. I received a mega-fire starter part # 435-507. I had purchased an after market starter before and it lasted 5 months. I really thought I was getting a Kohler starter. Invoice with the starter said replaces Kohler/52-098-13-s. The add is very misleading.
2,OK but not as good as Douwe Egberts,I wanted to try a flavored coffe with my Senseo Coffee maker and at the time Maxwell House was all I could find. Overall it was OK but nothing special. Pretty much the same as if it was from a Auto Drip maker. It truely made me realize that what is good about the Senseo is the Douwe Egberts coffee. I next need to try some of this coffee in my drip maker.
5,"Expert Job Of ""GOLDEN AGE"" Detective Yarn!","At a harmless party, the discussion turns to real life and detective story murders, and little do we know that before the night is out, the hostess will be ""dispatched"" in a classic ""Locked Room"" case. With our narrator tagging behind three famous detectives, (all among the most famous of the the ""Golden Age""), we learn how these three come up with three different solutions to the crime. Meanwhile, our intrepid hero, the bulldog-like Sgt. Beef, nonchalantly states he ""knows who dunnit"" practically from the git go! An amusing, superbly plotted 1935 English mystery with among the most unusual solutions you'll ever find!"
3,I wasn't that amused,"A psuedo-tongue-in-cheek whodunit in the tradition of the golden age where all the suspects are gathered in one place during the crime and investigation. I found the three detectives, send ups of Lord Peter Wimsey, H. Poirot and Father Brown sort of unimpressive and didn't really go along for the ride that the author seemed to plan for the reader. The four plausible explanations of the crime were probably an original plot device in the 1930's but may be a bit stale now. It's an okay read for those looking for a light, undemanding British mystery."
1,impossible to assemble,"I echo a previous reviewer's experience. With the rubber gaskets we were provided, I do not believe that the laws of physics will allow assembly. I am fairly adept at assembling this sort of thing, but have given up on this product. When the directions warn you that assembly will be difficult, take this warning seriously. I also note that the ""pulleys"" provided with my unit are different from the illustration in the instructions. This makes me wonder if the company has changed the sourcing for this product and, consequently, there were quality control issues.The very first thing that the instructions state is that the product is not a toy - this is exactly correct. Do not purchase this item thinking that there will be fun involved."
1,Don't waste your money,We bought this for my sons science project to launch his paper airplanes. It won't even launch a paper airplane.
3,Fails to Sustain Its Promise,"Like many others, I was quickly sucked in to the first part of Nick McDonell's sophomore effort (after reading and completely enjoying Twelve). Knowing what awaited me in the second part, and having lived through 9/11 myself as a NYC resident in 2001, I had great hopes for what lay ahead. But for me, the entire plot quickly short circuited,leaving literary fragments in its wake. By the end, I was asking myself why his editor hadn't done a better job.I look forward to the next effort. He shows great promise; it wasn't close to being fulfilled with this book."
5,A excellent guide to reading Aristotle himself,"The work of Aristotle is difficult, wide-ranging and dry. As Joanathan Barnes explained in the introduction in this book, this is probably because Aristotle's work is an unauthorized collection of lecture notes. Therefore, an introduction to the main themes in his work is an invaluable help to approaching the master's work. The Cambridge guide has chapters on metaphysics, logic, ethics, philosophy of science, science, psychology, politics, rhetoric. It also contains a massive bibliography. The essays concentrates on explaining the content of Aristotle's work, but it also introduce readers to modern controveries in interpretating Aristotle. The essay of Barnes on the very confusing work Metaphysics is pure gold. Other essays are excellent too."
4,Superb cast - Is the story True or False?,Excellent film starring many awarded and soon-to-be-awarded actors. Filmed in Yugoslavia. Excllent sound effects and dialog tracks despite the obvious problems of recording remotely. Excellent acting and casting is flawless! A must-see in ALL THREE PARTS; if you see only part you will long for what you are missing! I bought years ago but was only able to get the European version in Region 2. PURCHASE ALL THREE PARTS!
2,Don't be fooled by the picture,"I got this ring hoping that it looks like the picture which was misleading. If you purchase this ring, please be aware that it is 1/10 cttw which means that the diamonds are really small. If you are a man looking to buy a ring for his significant other, I would recommend you spend it a little bit more and buy a better looking ring. I ended up returning it."
2,The picture looks better,"The ring was pretty chincy once I saw it in person, the picture makes it look better than it really is. It was pretty thin at the base, it seemed it would be easy to break apart. I returned my purchase."
5,Great Book,"this book is about two young girls who are envited to a sleep over with their reading group-""the rabbits"". they both want to go (especially since the girls crushes will be there!) but one of them has a secret problem. with the help of an unlikely friend and a great teacher, the girls get to go to the sleep over and have an exciting night thats full of suspence and fun.i would recemend it to any young girl from ages 9 to 13. i got it from my grandmother and have already read it twice and really enjoyed it both times."
5,Great BOok!!,"I am 22 years of age but I remember reading this book in the sixth grade. I fell in love with it and thought the whole idea of kids actually reading and enjoying reading was fantastic. Too bad kids today do not have the same passion. It isn't sappy or superficial, but is a real depiction of what it feels like at that age."
1,Boring,I did not like this book because it was boring and it had no point to it.(at least not to me) The book deals with a girl who comes head to head with her fear and is also worried about how her friends will react when they find out.
4,I was intruiged enough to sign up for a course!,"Although this book reads very much like Celestine Prophecy, the difference is that it is based on true events (there is a disclaimer that some facts have been changed to enhance the story line). Although I personally would have prefered a non-fiction medium, it reads well. I hope to take an Ascension course in November!"
1,A mistake,"Guys, the lens you are showing is NOT the DCR-FE180PRO !You are showing a completely different lens!"
4,Here are the song titles:,1. La Fusian d'Angoisse et de curiosite2. One Thousand Angels Dancing ona Pin's Head3. Enoema Elisij4. Charun eth Chara5. Aizen Myoo6. Orange in the Air7. A Dream Unfinished8. Who am I?9. Ta-TshenenTotal Time: 74:08 minutes. World Serpent Distribution
4,darkly atmospheric,"I first became aware of this CD when it was played at the Tower Records I worked at in 1996. It's the perfect CD for Halloween - it has darkly atmospheric soundscapes, complete with synthesized sounds and percussion, and female voices that add to the mood.Unfortunately, the copy I obtained was just the CD without the case, so I'm unfamiliar with the song titles. I found it on the ground somewhere, and I remembered hearing it at work, so I brought it home. And it's pretty good. I was interested in any information about this artist, but so far haven't had much luck. If only I could get those titles..."
5,IF you like Mike you will like Airtime,"Airtime came out after the Bulls second championship, during a time when Jordan was being touted as the greatest player that ever was just preceding the final season before his first retirement. What is captured here is the last of the youthful Jordan who beat you with speed because he didn't have to out think you. This video is only second to Micheal Jordan's playground in capturing the athletic marvel that Air Jordan possessed. Whether you are a basketball -or- Jordan enthusiast or impressed by the things Micheal Jordan could and did do on the court, I recommend this video. The people at NBA Entertainment packaged it so that it is not some romp for enthusiasts only. Quite entertaining. Expect to see Micheal Jackson, as well! Hey, maybe that works for you, eh 8-)"
4,Sweet Indeed,"If you're going to do an album of covers you have to walk the fine line between being respectful to the material and putting your own stamp on familiar songs. Joan Osborne walks that line masterfully on this disc. She manages to inhabit these songs...distinctive Aretha Franklin and Jimi Hendrix gems as well as oft-covered classic songs like ""The Weight"" and the title song...in versions that are fresh and unique. From the sublimely understated versions of Edwin Starr's ""War"" (eerily appropriate these days) and Sly Stone's ""Everybody is a Star"" to the funkier workouts of the Undisputed Truth's one-hit classic ""Smiling Faces Sometimes"" (aided here by some sweet bass by Meshell Ndegeocello and backing vocals by the one and only Isaac Hayes) and Dave Mason's ""Only You Know and I Know"", Joan seems completely at home with the material from start to finish. How sweet it is indeed."
1,"Joan, what were you thinking?!","I can hardly believe this album is so poor. C'mon, this is Joan Osborne we're talking about, isn't it? Isn't this the same woman who put out probably the most brilliant album of 1995, ""Relish""?Somehow, I don't think so.This album is a collection of cover tunes, all are sparsely done with Joan's drawling, souless singing. The choice of material is questionable too: Axis: Bold as Love, War?If you are looking for the quality of artist from ""Relish"" it is most definately not to be found in this CD. Age, it seems, has mellowed our Joan to the point that she is no longer entertaining.Sorry to be so harsh, Joan, but what were you thinking?"
3,So Hip It Hurts,"Honestly, I am tired of artists doing a covers album. Joan Osborne's ""How Sweet It Is"" adds nothing new to the slew of covers albums already out there. She can't be treading water after only two studio albums can she? The covers on this disc are adequate at best with Stevie Wonder's ""Love's In Need Of Love Today"", The Spinners ""I'll Be Around"" and Undisputed Truth's ""Smiling Faces Sometimes"" being the standouts. Poorest are the rendetions of Sly & The Family Stone's ""Everybody Is A Star"", The Band's ""The Weight"" and Jimi Hendrix's ""Axis: Bold As Love"". Unfortunately, what brings this cd down is the worn out song selection. Joan could have dug deeper into the vaults for inventive, less heard material. The songs also have a bit of a lackluster production to them--as if Joan was bored with some of the selections. Anyway, if you are a Joan Osborne fan you know she can do much better and are already looking forward to her next release."
4,What? Am I Supposed to Resist This Album?,"It's a combination that had no chance of losing: Osborne's smooth, gritty growl updating some almost-forgotten hits from the seventies that have some resonance in these dark times. I guess I'm in the right age bracket, but I think I would have grooved to this one at any point in my life. Close your eyes and enjoy (unless you're driving)."
2,"product ok, company terrible",Took 4 months to receive lamp when ordered from company. Lamp broke after 2 months. Took 2 more months to receive replacement and then without the bulb. Still battling with them. My advise is to buy from a more reliable company.
1,Sho Sno,I would not buy this product again. It did not remove the light pee stains on her tail.I had used another shampoo that I purchased through Amazon that was a darker blue and it was AMAZING. I cannot seem find that product on the site now. If anyone knows what it is please let me know.
4,Improvement includes easier to read cup levels and no drip pouring,It's better than the original carafe. The handle and non drip pour design are perfect. It's perfect and fits the Capresso unit.
1,WOW!!! IT'S BAD,"Book is not really user friendly.Good luck finding where the full moons are listed.You would think that one would be clear and listed in the front of the book,In years past it was.This was a book that myself and others I know would get as soon as it came out.This is the last one I will buy .I wish they would fix the thing it could be great.A good start would be with the way it is organized.Things are thrown all over the place.Make information easier to find!!!"
3,Too much Cappadonna,"The description says it's from all members of Wu-Tang. It's basically a 2 hour Cappadonna documentary, sprinkled in with some live Wu show footage. But who wants that much Cappa? C'mon."
5,One of the great voices of the 60's,"I have the original LP of this. The song choices in this collection are beautiful, to go along with her voice. If I were to name the great female voices of this era (some still singing, including Carolyn Hester), it would be Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Carolyn Hester and Hedy West. I heard Joan Baez sing when she was still a college student in Boston. What a great time for folk music! Carolyn's voice is every bit as thrilling."
3,A foretaste of greatness,"Firstly Aerosmith is no classic debut and it is not the best Aerosmith album to start off your collection with. The production is thin, the band are uptight (especially noticable in Tyler's vocals).However, there are nuggets which give us a taste of what a terrific band Aerosmith are to become. There is the rocking classic; Mama Kin and the still golden Dream On. The excellent Somebody rocks your socks off and the Yardbirds influenced One Way Street is first class and you can't stop tapping your foot to Movin Out.This is not a great album, but is a good one and well worth a listen."
4,Start off here!,"If you are knew to Aerosmith you really want to start outat the top and buy this one. The first track ""Make It"" isone reason why... But you also get the first two in a longline of hits with Mama Kin and Dream On. This two songs areactually arguable the best that they did. There are a fewsolid other tracks like One Way Street and Write Me a Letter.True, the other few tracks are fillers... But Dream On andMama Kin are worth the price alone."
3,Make it...Don't Break It!,"Aerosmith livin' out their fantasy as ""YOUNG"" guns on the rock'n'roll scene. This album does rock. However, Steven and Joe still hadn't found their majic yet. Steven's voice still isn't natural sounding and Joe hasn't found that screaming sound that has carried Aerosmith through to this day(Excluding a few such as ""Don't Wanna Miss A Thing""). Pre-Jack Douglas the boys proved they didn't need too much direction as they got almost none on this record. Three stars is good but the rest of their studio discs don't fall below four. Not bad for just stumbling into their first production."
4,Very good debut album,"With a very few money they did a very good album with a solid base of R&B and clear rock 'n' roll. I think that the best songs are: Dream on, Mama kin & Walkin'the dog. If you don't have it yet, buy it, because maybe tomorrow the good Lord will teake you away!"
3,Not a bad album at all,"If, like me, you are just beginning to explore the work of Aerosmith this is a good cd to get. Having enjoyed ""Permanent Vacation"", I decided to start at the beginning and bought this album. I was not disappointed, it's a good solid rock lp in the classic sense. Although some tracks do stand out, e.g. Mama Kin & Dream On, the album as a whole has inegrity and is one of those cds that warrants being listened to again and again as a whole rather than by selection of a few good tracks."
4,The best rock song ever written is on this CD.,"OK, so it's not their best album. Then it's their second best. Right after ""get your wings"". I don'tcare what anyone says, ""one way street"" is the bomb! And worth the price of addmission!"
2,TOO HOT!,"Like the vast majority of slow cookers, this cooks too hot. It boiled the food on low. A four pound roast (VERY thick) was beyond well-well-done after 5 hours. On the other hand, I see the reviewer below who said it didn't cook fast enough on high, and the other reviewer who said the high and low settings are switched. I find that hard to believe, but it is worth checking out. I'll let you know what I find... UPDATE: On mine, high and low are NOT switched. But they are about the same temperature. I just did a cold water test using low only, and in less than 3 hours it is over 200 degrees (low should be around 170). High setting did the same thing. I would pay double the price if they would make this exact crockpot that WORKS CORRECTLY. Rival, are you listening???"
1,Not Worth the Money,I purchased this product and within 3 weeks have sent it back. I don't know if I had a defective one or if they just don't work. I put things in to cook on high and they were not done by 5:00. I had two other Westbend products before this that I loved and things always were done by 1:00 or 2:00. I was very dissappointed with this. Also the crock was very very heavy and hard to clean.
1,High and Low settings are switched,Model SCV1600B-SS. After burning two roasts and some chicken I started to do some checking. I found that the high and low setting are reversed. I filled the pot full of water about a inch from the top and turned it on high for 4 hours with the lid on. The temperature reached about 178 F. I switched it on low and the temperature reached about 198 F. I switched it back to high and the temperature went back down to 178 F. I got a couple of Rival Crock Pots from some friends that are different models purchased within the past two years and got similer results. They all had the high and low settings reversed. I emailed Crock Pot about this but haven't got a response yet.
3,Tail-less mermaid,My 5-yr-old daughter had the same problem with the tail falling off. Ours didn't have the pegs shown in the directions. I got out the clear packing tape and taped the tail to the base and it seems to hold up well now. She wanted this for a while and didn't want me to return it.
1,a piece of junk,"We have a 5-year-old in constant tears, because from the minute we took Mermaid Barbie out of the box, the tail fell off. Directions said it would click when attached correctly. It never clicked, and it doesn't stay in. This child looked forward to getting this doll for over a month, and now we are all disappointed. I see that amazon no longer sells the doll. That seems like a good decision!Sally Olds"
3,Good Overview,"This book is really a good of short articles and stories (I am assuming here) pulled from other publications. Because of this there is not a consistent theme that runs through the full book other then all the articles do have something to do with the American West - from ranch hands, cattle drivers and Indian's this book has it all. What I found with this lack of consistent theme is that many of the articles just wet you appetite for more information on the given subject.The book does provide a good overall view of the American west during the settlement days. The book is well written and is easy to get through. If you have just a general interested in the topic or want a refresher course this is probably the book for you. If you are looking for something more in depth you will probably come away disappointed."
4,CELEBRATING A COMPLICATED HISTORY,"Bestselling historian Dee Brown (Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee) chronicles an easily misunderstood era with sympathetic essays on prominent Indian leaders, cowboys, miners, and settlers. The turbulent transistion from buffalo and red men to cattle and white men becames more understandable in 29 brief chapters focusing on the pivotal events, fascinating individuals, and social forces. Vivid profiles include Sitting Bull, Billy the Kid, Cochise, Crazy Horse, Wyatt Earp, Captian Jack, and Chief Joseph. ""Let us be wise enough to learn true history so that we can recognize a myth when we see one,"" writes Brown."
1,Will not help Marketers Understand Site Analytics,"If you are a marketer and need a book to help you analyze your web stats available online from your hosting provider, do not buy this book. This is for big companies needing to program their own servers and extrapolate data. You will not learn much about terms and how to work with the auto generated reports. You will learn one thing: how ambiguous the data is to interpret but if you're looking for a book on web stats, then you already know its ambiguous. I wish I had a recommendation for you - and to help myself."
2,Dépassé,Ce livre a malheureusement mal vieilli : les informations de nature très techniques omettent un pan entier des nouvelles technologies du web.
1,flimsy trash truck,"Not very well made for little boys & girls. it's not sturdy and the trash can that comes with it doesn't latch on so it's very frustrating for the little ones. For the money, it's a rip off!!!!"
5,Easy Fold Map,"Great little map to stick in your travel bag. Laminated and easy to fold, fits in purse or auto glove box. Map shows Palm Springs, parts of Rancho Mirage,and Palm Desert."
2,PS map,"It was not helpful, Font was so small, i could barely make it out, even with glasses.never used it."
5,The Heaviest and Fastest BM band,"This album just bursts forth withunrelentless speed and aggression.There is no other band like Unlordand probably won't be. The drummerStabath is not human, his pummelingstyle is like a tornado out of control. Get this while you can."
2,Great Concept...Poor Execution,"Have you heard Trent Gardner's 1998 endeavor ""Age of Impact""? If so, be prepared...for the worst parts of that album have been fruitful and multiplied. The whole CD sounds incredibly cheap thanks to the use of synthesized strings and woodwinds. The vocal parts are written rather poorly, following the text in almost no logical fashion. Some of the vocalists are wonderful singers, but very few are featured in waya that reflects the strengths of their voices. With a project this large and comprehensive there are only two options: fantastic accomplishment or miserable failure. This one is behind door number two."
2,Resin??,Resin is a stretch. I expected the fairly rigid resin furniture that actually resembles wicker like home depot and other retailers carry. This is more like PVC strips that are woven over steel frame - similar to cheap outdoor furniture except it is brown. The price is commensurate with quality. I would like to find anyone who actually would pay $600 for this - i have this bridge in Brooklyn that I've been trying to sell. - i tried to return it - but shipping was almost as much as i paid for it....guess craigs list is my next stop
1,useless book,this book was worthless. if you need info. get another. they are insulting your intelligence.
2,Not what I expected.,This book provides some BASIC information. There are much better books out there with more material. Keep looking.
1,"The tools are great, but the batteries are useless.","I bought a Makita LXT211 18-Volt LXT Lithium-Ion Cordless 2-Piece Combo Kit, in the USA from Amazon, took it all the way back to the Philippines where I live, plugged it in to charge the batteries, and both batteries flash up as faulty!!!I bought the set through my company, as a safety award, so it is not like I have the receipt and can claim a new battery set, even if i were interested in shipping them half way round the world.One dead battery I could understand, just, but for both batteries to be useless from brand new is disgusting. Assuming it IS the batteries and not a faulty charger. I now have several hundred dollars worth of great quality power tools that I cannot use, as a new battery/charger set will cost as much as a complete new tool set, for some reason only the Gods at Makita can explain.!"
5,Great German Dictionary,"This dictionary is perfect for those who are just beginning to learn German, and those who are more advanced. Almost any word you can think of, from standard vocabulary to slang and everything in between is in there. A great buy!"
3,I bought this for one song,"I know what you're doing, baby. You're putting one terrific song on your CD, but not on iTunes, so I have to buy your CD. Well, I like that song enough to pay 2.99 for it, but the rest of the disc is skag. C'mon Dionne! Even AC/DC got with the program."
3,"Only place to find ""I Know"" these days","The album has a few good songs on it, but it's the only place you can find the song ""I Know"" these days, as it is not available via MP3 download from anywhere. Used, it was a good deal."
3,Great Single - OK Album,"Great single, ordinary album. Going solo after her stint with Arrested Development, Dionne Farris seemed intent on making a statement of her own. The single, ""I Know,"" promised a lot. Based on a snaking slide groove and a neat vocal hook, it gave the impression that Farris just might be able to break out. Unfortunately, the first solo album suggests Arrested Development without the diversity. Like that band, the musical topics are based on inner thoughts; sort of like cranial soul music. The titles alone give away - ""Stop to Think""; ""Food for Thought""; ""Find Your Way""; Even the song ""Passion"" approaches the subject of the title as if it were a mental exercise. Naturally, the arrangements are intelligently constructed, perhaps even a bit fussy. If only she could have tapped into the passion that she found on her hit single, this would have been one heck of an album. All in all, there's just too much thinking going on here for the record to be much fun."
3,Review of Prisoner of X,"An interesting read, it had some seriously funny moments, kind of raw humor but that's to be expected. I liked it but didn't think it really went anywhere, not very challenging but some interesting insight into some twisted real-life characters."
5,such a page turner,"i first night i read it, i couldnt put it down til 3:30 in the morning... and since have to wake up with my son, thats pretty late for me. i cant wait to pick up something blue and see where this funny group of people takes me next!"
1,Geh....,"Just because they were pretty, successful characters does not mean they are any less morally bankrupt. A worse waste of time than the 2 seconds I wasted of my life paying attention to a ""Bad Girls Club"" show commercial previewing ""this"" weeks episode."
2,Did not Like,"After reading the book Something Blue, which depicted Darcy as a selfish snob, I could not warm up to her in this book. Found myself closing the book around the 20th chapter, in disgust."
1,Written by a cheater,"I would be willing to bet money that the author of this book was, at some point, ""the other woman"" in a relationship and wanted to write a book validating that choice.I actually enjoyed the first half of the book. People are flawed, make mistakes, whatever. But the way this author tried to force a happy ending between some seriously f-ed up people made me want to throw the book in the garbage just in case someone I know picked it up and thought it would be a good read.This was a glorification of unhealthy relationships. And not in an ironic, or self-aware way. It was total trash and reminded me of 16 year old girls whining ""but, but, we're sooooo in luv!.""Vomit."
1,"Oh my God I HATE this book, don't waste your $","I read all kinds of books and enjoy chick lit and I'm not even finished with this book yet (I'm not sure if I'll be able to make myself finish it) but I had to come here to encourage people not to spend any money on this book. It's not funny at all, and all of the characters in it are not likeable. In fact the main character in this book is the most irritating character I've read in awhile. What a horrible person, you sleep with your best friend's fiance and it's ok because she's shallow, oh but wait you've been best friends with her for 20 years and you are just now noticing it? Give me a break! I agree with all other negative reviews about this book. I'm so angry I wasted money on this."
5,Something Borrowed,Wonderful easy read book with good storyline. Kept me reading to find out if she got her wish. Very enjoyable read.
5,Good Girl Gone Bad Makes for Good Book,"I've always seen Giffin's books on the shelf but never picked one up. Because of the new film coming out starring Kate Hudson and Ginnifer Goodwin (as the good girl), I was inspired to download a sample of the book to my Kindle. I was INSTANTLY hooked! I never would have imagined that I could fall in love with a character so much that I could watch as she turned her whole life upside down to be with the man she truly loves...who just happens to be her best friend's fiancée! Right to the last minute, the twists and turns, the will they or won't they, had my stomach in knots. It is hard to watch as the heroine does bad things but in doing so, learns how to stand up for herself after many years as her best friend's (and everyone else's) doormat.I read it in one long night with rarely a break. Definitely a (guilty) pleasure."
2,Dry and Boring,"I love to read, am an avid reader, I usually read about a book every 2 days. This one I couldnt even get through the first 100 pages before I put it down, I dont enjoy the whole, present - flast back, thing and this book did it A LOT! I also dont enjoy books written in the 1st person. I just couldnt do it!Great for those who enjoyed it but I wasnt one of them."
3,IT WAS OKKKKKKKK!,"The book was ok, I found myself being more upset with Rachel, then I did Darcy. It was not a page turner, it was slow in the middle. Over all, it was JUST OK."
4,you can't put it down!,"I read this book with my bookclub, and although it felt like an easy read, it was probably because it was such a good, fun read. Most of my bookclub went on to read the sequel too, which I highly recommend, I enjoyed it more than the first, and read them both within a week's time."
4,Good girl gone bad!,"I loved this book of friendship, love and betrayal. I wonder if he was actually worth it. Overall the book was good, but I have to admit that I didn't like the plot at all. A woman, even a woman as self-centered as Darcy, should be able to trust her best friend with her boyfriend. If you can't trust your best friend who can you trust?"
4,Something Borrowed,"On the eve of her 30th birthday, good girl Rachel White drinks too much and finds herself having sex with Dexter, her best friend's fiance. I didn't think I'd like a story about betraying your best friend. But, Rachel and Dex realistic and likable characters, that you can't help routing for their romance."
4,Good book,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was smartly written and funny throughout. You can't help but cheer for Rachel when she steals Dex. If you have ever in one time in your life felt like a friend was putting you down and running all over you - this book is for you. The ultimate revenge! I loved it!!
5,My favorite summer read!,Absolutly loved this book! One of the best books Ive read in a long time! And the ending omg what a suprise!!!
1,rachel is a loser,"Also can't believe all the raves about this book. Come on! The protagonist is so incredibly boring and insecure, blaming all her misfortunes on her friend? Have zero tolerance for this kind of people... The writing was very average as well. Skip this one!"
3,Great for book club discussion,"Read the complete review at: [...]All in all, the book was an easy read, pretty entertaining and has a good dose of drama. The pace was decent and I was able to read the book pretty quickly. This book is what I would consider light summer reading. The book also brought some very good conversation for the book club, and it would be a good pick for that purpose."
2,Not a Heroine you want to Support,SPOILER~ The author tried to make you sympathize with Rachel's situation when in reality I didn't think Dex was a catch and I started to spite Rachel for acting like a victim when she had every opportunity to change her situation and take control of her life! Honestly I was hoping she would end up with Ethan who was CLEARLY the real catch! AND--I don't care what Darcy did to her! Women need to have respect for other women! NOT COOL RACHEL.
5,just have to find out what happens,"Like so many other reviewers, you wonder how you can at first like the narrator of this story, Rachel, and before you know it you are rooting her on and you just can't wait to see how the story ends. I loved this book, I read a lot, but I don't often take the time to write a review. This is just such a fun book to get lost in and you can really relate to the characters. You want it to all work out, but you have to wait to find out. I can't wait to read the sequel, which is Darcy's story."
3,Cute but shallow,This book has a very cute (yet predictable) story-line. It's a very easy read and great if you are in the mood for something light.
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I bought this book in the airport between flights. By the next day, I was already 1/2 way through it. A bit predictable, typical chick-lit, but a fun and easy read. Perfect beach or vacation book! Can't wait to read more from Emily Giffin!"
3,Too much day dreaming,"It's one of those no brainer easy read books, so on that front, it met my expectations. The idea behind the book seems fun, but the way it was delivered was not as entertaining as I thought it can be. There's way too much day dreaming on Rachel's part, which could be funny but was not. The moral dilemma would have been more interesting if Darcy's personality wasn't made to be such a bitch. Because the author tries too hard to justify Rachel's decisions, she made a villain out of Darcy to the extend of sacrificing the believability of the story. I mean, how many 30 year-olds are willing to give up their fiance just to compete with a pretend sister? This level of immaturity makes me think that perhaps the book's target audiences are not 30 year-olds, but college or high school readers."
5,Don't get too serious,Wow I just enjoyed the story for entertainment. I did not look that far into it and never expected it to be a realistic portrayal of every woman's life. It's fiction. It is a great book
4,Loved it!,"I didn't really know about this book until the previews for the movie came out. I didn't see the movie, and I haven't yet, and I wanted to read the book first. I had absolutely no idea what it was about and I was pretty excited about reading it.I believe I read almost half of the book in the first night I started reading, I stayed up until 1 AM! I just couldn't put it down. It is very very well written and it just really draws you in the story, you sympathize with the characters and I think any one who reads it could relate to some extent to Rachel. I laughed when I realized that when I was growing up I had a friend almost like Darcy, but thankfully the friendship has long been over. And it also made me so happy to see a happy ending that was somewhat more realistic than other chick-lit. I highly recommend this book! I'm now exciting to start reading Something Blue and the rest of Emily Griffin books!"
5,One of my new favorites,"I absolutely loved this book! I would have read this book in a sitting had my husband left me alone long enough. I think my book perturbed him, he kept asking ""What's so funny?"" because I smiled the whole way through. I loaned it to a friend and can barely wait for her to finish so we can talk about it."
3,Good writing. Shame about Rachel.,"Great book, decent plot, somewhat believable characters, but, oh dear, the main character is too blah for words. What a disappointment. I never got any sense of Rachel's emotional range, which is a shame, since she has so many opportunities in which to display it. Giffin can write and keep you glued to the story, but this book is ultimately frustrating. Our main character is involved in an exciting and daring affair, yet remains 2-dimensional emotionally."
2,"If your over 30, don't bother",My 31 year old niece raved about this book and that's just whom it was written for. Thirtysomethings. Rachael is so insipid every other character outshines her and Dex asks Darcy to marry him just because they have been dating for a long time? It was just boring.
2,a little lacking,"The premise of the book sounded like a light, girly read. It was just that, but lacked substance all together. Our book club read it, and as a group, we were divided. Some liked it, some didn't. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Not everything is as it may appear.....,"When would it ever be okay to sympathize with a cheater? Not just a cheater but a cheater who is cheating with her best friend's fiance?!This books helps remind us that sometimes things are not always as they may appear from the outside, that people shouldn't be so judgmental, and that there's generally an exception to every rule.Great messages in a fun, thought-provoking story.Definitely follow-up with Something Blue!"
4,Something borrowed VN,"This was a rather fast audio read. I enjoyed every moment and kept grabing the next disk till it was over:( Then I had to go get the next audio book ""Something Blue""..Stay tuned on that one."
4,Something borrowed,Book looked brand new. Looking forward to seeing the movie. Good book for light hearted reading. I read a little every day and finished it in a week.
3,"Not bad for a ""chick lit"" book","I don't usually like these types of books because they are so predictable but for whatever reason, I enjoyed this one.I think that the writing was decent and offered some insights into the characters though they were not always truly believable.Rachel is the quiet, shy one with a wallflower personality. Her best friend Darcy is the outgoing, egotistical one who thinks that the world revolves around her. Darcy is engaged to Dex and Rachel is the maid of honor at the upcoming nuptials. Things go wrong however once Rachel and Dex have a one night stand. Rachel and Dex are confused over this situation but continue to have a relationship.What follows is their tangled romance and the approaching date of Darcy and Dex's wedding.I think that parts of the story were truly funny and realistic but I felt a little let down at the end in the way that Dex and Rachel's relationship was redeemed."
1,i'm affraid to go see the movie if it is anything like the book,"I hated this book! I didn't care for the characters of Rachel, Darcy and especially Dex. Why is he so appealling to Rachel!!!! I don't care how miserably Rachel ""ALLLOWS"" Darcy to treat her,does she really want to fall in love with someone who behaves this way. What a weasel! What is there to like about this character (Dex) that she is willing to behave this way regardless of her feelings towards her ""best"" friend. It doesn't make ANY sense?!I think that she is a pathetic, whiny character. She should think better of herself, distance herself from Darcy, dump Dex and move to England to be with Ethan, the only character that I liked in this awful book. Terrible book, a complete waste of my time and now that I think about it I'm skipping the movie as well"
4,extra ordinary chicklit,"when i began to read this book, i thought ""ah.. it's just for a fun reading, like any other chick lits"", but it was not! this book is an extra ordinary chick lit.. the plots are well-written, the characters are so well-described that you'll either love or hate any one of them.the story tells about two best friends rachel and darcy. rachel was the smart ones, and darcy the gorgeous ones. darcy was engaged to dex the handsome man whom was rachel's best friend from college.what happened next when your childhood best friend dated to the man you secretly loved, and they were going to be married very soon? was it right or wrong to get the love of your life but you got to take him from your best friend's? bet you could not put this book down.."
3,Great girly book!,"This book was a good read, some brutal chick lit stuff. I like to see the evolving of the characters, the back and forth between friendship and love which is always a consumming dilemma when facing a situation like this. I would recommand it :)"
3,"Well-rounded characters, but too neatly wrapped up","Emily Giffin is a gifted writer in that her characterization is top-notch. Her exploration of the dynamics of friendship between women is exceptional. However, her representation of the love between Dex and Rachel truly fell short. I didn't really understand this ""special connection"" between them, and I never warmed up to the protagonist. I also found Dex, who I think the readers were supposed to love, quite repulsive for his actions throughout the work. The aforementioned characters were much too passive aggressive and it didn't work for me. Additionally, Darcy was too conveniently villainized. It was a cop out on the part of Giffin.Also, the ending? Also extremely convenient."
5,Very Surprised!,"I was unsure if I would like this book. Honestly, I only read it because the movie got me interested. I had no expectations when I started and I ended up reading the book very quickly because I could not put it down. Such a great read that I will def. read other books by Emily Giffin."
4,Nice watch,This is a very nice watch with many features that makes it look like it costs MUCH more than it does! I am very pleased.
4,Good book if you're a Wimsey fan,"If you're a fan of Dorothy L. Sayers' character, Lord Peter Wimsey, you will likely find this book interesting and enjoyable. The authors, both professors, look at the Wimsey series in light of what was happening in England at the time they were being written, and show how Sayers incorporated so much of her surroundings into these stories.If you're not a Wimsey fan, then there is probably little point in reading this book. Although it is well-written, most of its meaning will probably be lost."
5,Best Ever Kitchen Tool,"I've used this more than I ever thought I would, mixes and blends well, doesn't scratch - just great. Bought one for both daughters and my sisters."
4,Small But Useful,"This arrived smaller than expected. I purchased it to replace a wisk I accidentally melted. I failed to check the dimensions before I purchsed it. It works great, though. It is the absolute best design for making gravy. If you have never tried a flat wisk, give this a try. You won't be disappointed...unless you accidentally melt it."
2,irritating piece of research,"Anyone doing research into the history of anaesthesia should check this out, but this should definitely not be the last or only word on the controversy. Historians tend to disagree on who should be credited with the discovery of anaesthesia in the United States: Wells or Morton. MacQuitty plants herself well within the Morton supporter's camp, oversimplifying a complex series of human interactions and relationships by dismissing Wells' role in the ""discovery"" (excuse the scare quotes) and adpotion of surgical anaesthesia, especially when treating ether, nitrous oxide, and cholorform as historically identical substances."
1,This CD will likely cause severe brain damage,"How could words possibly describe how lousy this album is? I have suggested to my Congresswoman that this CD be treated as pollution and the owners and purveyors of it should be subject to severe fines for harming the environment, both physical and mental. The songs are inane. There should be warning labels on the jewel case stating 'This CD will likely cause severe brain damage'. Pass on this meritless waste of your valuable time!"
2,AIR SEA RESCUE,"This was an interesting book in as much as it is the first I have read on the RAF Air Sea Rescue service. The action is good but much of the book, which only covers about 24 hours, is nothing more than crew members and aircraft survivors talking and the RAF Group Captain's problems with one of his junior officers."
3,Not as good as I'd heard.,"For years, I have heard about this book. After reading it, I am not that thrilled. I would suggest purchasing the JR Ackerly biography, as opposed to this. It's a bit sanitized for my taste."
1,Made me fish sick,I tryed this food because the person at my local fish store said it was good. After two days of them eating it 7/17 fish were sick. I kept going with the food because at the time i didnt think it was the food. After about two weeks the fish were still sick. I then decided to switch foods as an expiriment. I switched to Aqueon tropical flakes. The fish are gettingtheir color back and are acting healthier. So get Aqueon tropical flakes and not this.
4,This is a great book for modern hand-piecing patterns!,"This book is very cool. All my other hand-piece pattern books feature old, traditional patterns before everyone started machine-piecing. Most pattern books today assume you're machine-piecing and the instructions have to be adjusted. But this book is wonderful! Lots of fun, up-to-date, incredible geometric patterns for hand-piecing! It shows not only what one block will look like, but what the quilt will look like so you can see all the secondary patterns which often aren't what you'd anticipate! Gives you everything you need, including templates. Blocks are mostly not for beginners, unless you're already good at hand-sewing."
2,Doesn't Last/Poor Product,"I purchased this Drill June 2010. Since then, the Ratcheting/Clutch went out and I had to send it back. That put me out 3 weeks. Then, although I wasn't sure I was charging the batteries correctly ( I was ), I had to send in the batteries and charger in and they were replaced. Now, I have had the batteries and charger back for 4 months and the batteries are again draining too fast. Of course, Makita has no idea why any of this is happening, but I have had a Hitachi Impact Driver for 3-1/2 years and it runs circles around this %$#@&* Makita. Did I mention that the Clutch slipped briefly yesterday at its least slippage setting ? So, that may be going again. WHO writes all these good reviews about this Makita Drill ? Makita ?"
3,It is just what it seems to be,"This is the original soundtrack (no dialogue) of the charming ""The Cat Returns"" movie from Studio Ghibli (directed by a Miyazaki protoge, not Miyazaki himself). If you are looking for the sweet song that closes the movie, ""Kaze Ni Naru"", (in which Ayano Tsuji sings with accompaniment primarily from her ukelele) here it is!!! I bought a copy from the ""sellthingsguy"" retailer and he was great---product was delivered early and in perfect condition."
4,Prescient warning for Americans,"Not farfetched at all, and in some ways the fiction has been surpassed by truth.There is the remarkable similarity of the fictional President Boyd's attemptsto overthrow the Constitution, and what was attempted by the real PresidentBush. Although Boyd uses assassination and staged bombings in the U.S., Bushused 9/11 in a similar manner to induce fear in the population and provide arational for executive rule. Boyd's power play runs into more Congressionalopposition and is less brazen than the reality of actions by G.W. Bush.This is in the tradition of fictional warnings of distopia, such as 'ItCan't Happen Here', ""Brave New World"" and ""1984"".It's also a good political action thriller; better than the Clive Custlerbooks.Weinberger has certainly used his knowledge of the inner workings ofgovernment to good effect here."
4,Expiration date,"Product is Great on more thank just steaks! I love this product but Amazon.com send me the product with only 3 months before the expiration date is up on it. I ordered 1 case because I use this product a lot, I'm not going to use 12 bottles in 3 months. So I don't know if I will order it from Amazon.com any more. I wish all the stores in my area carried this product so I would not have to order it online."
2,Deja Vu'd out!,"If after waiting 7 years for a new Fogerty studio album, the best adjective I can ascribe to it is 'pleasant' then by John's exacting standards ( and indeed by the equally stringent expectations of his loyal fans) then this album is pretty much a flop. 'Pleasant' in this instance is a euphemism for colourless and unexciting, and in the case of most of the tracks, downright boring. John has always, quite rightly, delved deeply into his musical past, much to the delight of us old CCR fans. It worked admirably on albums like Centrefield and Blue Moon Swamp, but I fear the previously unexhaustable well of musical talent may now have dried up. I hope not. I love John Fogerty's music but if this is all that remains then now is the time to retire gracefully, rather than just fading away. 'Pleasant' is not a word I want to describe John by."
4,Fogerty: No one's quite like him,"Starting out with a Fogerty's personal strike against war when ""a war has no end,"" DEJA VU makes it crystal clear where one of rock's original protesters stands on current events. The rest of the CD is more of an old fashioned look at life and its daily events through a slightly twangy point of view. I think Fogerty even channels Roger Miller when he hits ""Honey Do,"" and the rest of the CD basically finds Fogerty in good spirits. There are a couple of misfires here, particularly the overwrought, ""In The Garden.,"" but overall this just makes you wish the guy would get in the studio more often."
3,Is bookmarking too much to ask for?,"I love Analog, and devour each issue with joy. I read it on my Android using the Kindle app and formatting is perfect, however I can't bookmark. Reading a 25,000 word novella is difficult if I can't bookmark my page. I understand on a Kindle I wouldn't need to worry because it holds the page, but on a multifunction device it's a necessity. Amazon please implement bookmarking on not just Analog, but on all magazines/newspapers. It's ridiculous not to have it."
1,Analog Magazine Not Useable on Kindle 2,"I originally started my Kindle subscription to Analog on the original Kindle and it was fairly readable, with the ability to jump between articles, go to the index, etc.Once I switched to the Kindle 2, previous and new editions of this magazine are unusable, unless you intend to read the magazine from page one to the end. You cannot use ANY of the features common to other magazines (I also get the Atlantic and Readers Digest.You can't search, go to the index, skip and article or story, etc. I e-mailed the publisher and they said they were aware of the problem and were working on a fix. But that was two editions ago and I can't afford $2.99 a month for something that can't be read ... to bad it WAS a great Kindle magazine.Note that this is the same problem with the Asimov's magazine (same publisher)"
5,Awesome Product!!!,"I've fallen in love with my various RoadWired wraps- I routinely wrap up my cameras, PDA's and portable hard drives. The bright colors make it easy to find in a crowded backpack. While the RoadWired wraps are no substitute for a properly-padded camera bag, let alone a Pelican Case, they do offer just enough protection for a quick, inconspicuous photo shoot. I can wrap up a $2,000 DSLR and stuff it in my messenger bag without advertising to everyone that I'm a professional photographer on assignment."
4,quick fix for bad burners!,"These burner covers are a great, economical way to hide burners that have gone bad. No, they're not the heavy-duty stainless steel covers that you've seen advertised, but then again, they're not $50 and up, either. They're comparable to inverted, sturdy cookie sheets - fit perfectly and match my stainless-steel stove surprising well. All in all, a great product."
5,A must read,"Every human being should read this book and at least attempt to put it into practice. It rings a resounding 'yes, this is actually the correct way to live' with a turn of each page. The world would be a different place if we could each give this some effort."
1,No sympathy no surprise,"One of the worst films I have seen about children suffering. I am sorry maybe it is because I have not been in dire straits before, but I sat down thinking this movie was about boys being prepared to enter Hitler's army (horrfic), or about boys in some concentration camp (Profoundly sad). The only thing this movie was about was boys in a Juvenile delinquent type facility and the people in charge not properly taking care of them. Yes, the dude molested the boys but that was one person. You mean to tell me he molested every single one of them? Another thing when they took over the camp didn't they think the brigade would come in? And since the governor brought it up in one of the conversations, would the boys prefer prison instead of the facility? To me in prison their arse would of been raped most likely as well.How about making a film about black boys being arrested falsely and sent to prison. Not juvenile hall but jail with the big bad monsters."
1,WTH?,"How do you get money out of a failed sex video project? One answer is to make some kind of documentary out of it. I figured this might not be everything I was hoping for. I got that right. If you are looking for nudity, acting, dialogue, story, some kind of significant documentary, or even entertainment, you would do better with a bowl of cold oatmeal. However, if you are inspired by half an hour of a red plastic shirt and you have two dollars that you can't think of anything else to do with, then this is your video. Sometimes there is almost a kind of pathetic humor in how the guy describes what happened, but not enough to make me watch more than a few minutes at a stretch. This could have been funny, but by the time he gets to the cops coming in, I was hoping they would just shoot him, and apparently it wasn't even worth getting excited about anyway. You are in no danger of prosecution for anything with this, or of staying awake either."
3,"Ok read, but best not to think too hard","Having read Beason and Anderson's other books with the same characters, I found ""Lethal Exposure"" a bit of a dissapointment. While the characters were fairly well developed, and the idea had merit, the actual execution left something to be desired.For instance I did not believe for one minute that Baretti could be that clueless as to the Indian's true motives. I had it figured out as soon as they sat down to talk the first time.As another example, Kriedent should have been able to discern the cause of the explosion a lot sooner than he did. He had all the clues and specialized knowledge in front of him. Why it took me 3/4s of the book to figure out is beyond me. Again This was so obvious that it was practially shoved in the reader's face and I was able to determine the cause when they first met Dumenco and learned what he was working on.All in all I'd give this book a read, if you are on a plane and there is nothing else to read. Otherwise skip it."
3,Wrong Illustration,The illustration shown for this product is incorrect.The illustration shows the solution in the later tube packaging.The product that I received came in the earlier plastic bottles.
2,Live CD. not worth it. not all that good.,"Aerosmith's live CD, ""Classics live"" is okay, but it needs a different style than just that Aerorock. I guess that's what you'd expect."
4,Not Bad... pretty good actually,"I Like this album... the only thing that is bad about it is that it was too short for a live album... also it didn't have alot of the really good songs... though it did have some good ones like Dream On, Sweet Emotion, and Kings and Queens. Dream on is my favorite Aerosmith song and for some reason i liked the way it counded on this album... I actually like the way it sounds on this album better than the origional recording... same thing goes for kings and queens... anyway.. it sounds good but it's too short."
5,Can't get better than this,"I've listened to many guided meditation CD's, including some by Joseph Goldstein and Sharon Salzburg, but even those teachers can't compare with this CD. There's something incredibly relaxing about Bodhipaksa's voice that guides you easily and quickly into a relaxed state.I'll come back to this CD over and over again.Highly recommended."
4,"Very smooth delivery; patient, unhurried.","As other reviews have stated - it is just the guy's voice... he has a very faint accent (somewhat Irish, but again - very faint). His delivery is unhurried, and smooth. No background music is both good and bad: it's great because if done poorly that can really be distracting... but if done well it does help, and can also block out background noises a little too. This CD will work best if you're fortunate enough to have absolute silence to work with... which for many of us simply isn't the case.The breathing meditation is really good - you can really relax to it and he keeps your mind at rest nicely. The 2nd mdeitation is nice as well, and has some positive affirmations mixed in: a nice ""feel good"" meditation. the third is a ""walking meditation""... I don't foresee using that one, but I do like the first two a lot, both in there own way are great."
3,Guided Meditations,"It could be that after reading the rave reviews I expected more, but I think this CD was mediocre and way over-priced."
1,CD RECORDING WAS VERY GARBLED,"the recording was garbled. Could hardly hear the narrarator. I don't believe that I am the only one who got a bad CD.I wish I could write the seller about this problem, just in case, hoping to get a response.M. Hassan, MD"
2,a little blase,"I found this meditation to be forgettable. Long bouts of silence throughout. If I am going to pay for a CD, why would I want to pay for silence? Just not what I was looking for. Very little guided meditation. A lot of down time."
5,receiver,"I ordered this item and received it ontime as advertised,The instructions were clear,installation was easy and I am pleased with my new liftmaster receiver/opener."
1,Awful. Not much else to say,"I give paper fortune a 3-4 out of five stars. The Kindle edition is horrible, a complete waste of time. You get a few of the main articles, but most of the rest of what shows up turns out to be tiny little bits of junk: Text boxes and pullout-garbage (I used to work in the magazine world) that is essentially page filler in the printed editions. I thought this was so cheap it would have to be worthwhile, but unless they include more meat, this is a total waste of money. Better to get the WSJ or Financial Times."
1,"For Magazines, get an iPad",Well I have a iPad and was thinking of checking out the kindle since it offered better reading under the sun etc. However I think this doesn't work for magazines and it defintiely doesn't work for Fortune. I subscribe to Fortune on iPad and its interactive parts and color made it alot more enjoyable than the printed magazine. I think kindle users should just keep using it for books.
5,I recognize each sitution as one of muy life.,"Sex and the city is local so you painted the whole word in each situation. I can't watch it all the episodes, but women ,we are just like you show them in every situation. My best friend lost her whole life in obssetion with a Mr biggs. and an the witty story of the girl who married an scotichs that was a lesson in the best form to teach us. Every relation is wasted , looking for the another that should arrive and will be better,so why lose time with this? And life goes by,good, bad men, who had the time to get to know each other fully ? Afraid to commitment. I love this, muy favourite Sex and the City. Every thing seems to be only a show off, but deep inside is a litle like real life.Not always is as we wish it be. Reality is what it is ,we aren't even as peoples wants us to be. So it a serious in disguise."
3,Sex and the City Third Season,"Love the series, so I couldn't go wrong with buying it. The cover was broken a little, but that wasn't too terribly important to me. The DVD was in good shape."
5,Love SATC,I think in the 3rd season of SATC the series gets into its stride and it becomes the SATC that people have grown to love. It's a toss up which is my favorite between season 3 and 4 but my absolute favorite episode is Hot Child in the City found in season 3!
3,"I love it, but.....","I bought all three seasons this past depressing, snow-bound winter. After just a couple of days of constant SITC viewing, my husband was making fun of me for not moving from the couch all weekend. A few days later I found that he had taken root at the other end. Heh! This is a collection that men won't mind being made to watch.As for the content...it's not that this season is lacking eventful, suspenseful content. It's just depressing. Carrie spends most of the season making stupid, weak decisions. Yeah, maybe we've all made them. But it leaves you thinking she's not so fabulous.On a more practical note...If you have spent the past few years glued to HBO on Sunday nights OR if you spent money on the first two, you might as well get the third. If the 4th season in its entirety is as good as the few shows I've seen, you'll need to see the 3rd season to catch up on the storyline. It might be worth it to catch a few snazzy one-liners from Samantha, haha!"
4,Truly different in the jazz arena,"My wife and I just saw them a few weeks back, and this CD captures the energy of the band (Black and White is great, but a bit to smooth-jazzed-out). These guys are great, as I have been following them since their first CD. Mind you, as most 'best ofs', there is some critical bits missing, however the record company did a decent job on this one...Their sound is very unique, however is not totally East or West - their blend of the elements of both is infectious! If you want to round out your jazz collection, or just get something different from all the smooth jazz bs that is out there (eg Kenny G), try this one out - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
1,Don't buy this one.,"This seat doesn't work right. Somehow my daughter's pee would run between the plastic base and the foam seat and it was disgusting! The foam pads also fell off of the bottom quickly. For my next daughter we purchased this seat:[...]It works perfectly, stays clean, and is all around way better."
3,"Hey, It's Little Feat","No, this probably isn't the best live CD the Feat have put out, but it is, after all, Little Feat. If you're a Feat fan, there's plenty to enjoy. Some long and tedious cuts? Perhaps, but the musicianship and tight jams make this well worth the effort."
4,Background and History of Hunting,"This is a great book about the history of hunting in general, and the uniqueness of our freedom in America. It explains the opportunities we, as commoners, have to hunt and how sportsmen of this country have contributed to protect, nourish, and improve the wildlife of our Nation. This is a book all people who enjoy America's wildlife should read and pass along to others to make sure our heritage is understood and our rights to enjoy the fair chase are protected for future generations."
5,Execellent read,"I just happen to stumble on to this book, found it to be so very informative with a humours twist! I recommend everyone woman with or without a uterus to read this...it is without a doubt a well written book!"
5,great summer reading,"Though romance is not my usual genre, I read this on the recommendation of a friend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Quite humorous and well written and historically accurate. I'll be sure to look for more Angie Kay books."
5,Great cooler,"We bought this cooler for a 2-night camping trip, and it kept the ice intact until we returned. It's nice and sturdy, clicks closed to remain insulated, and is easy to carry. Totally worth the money."
1,wrong item for 2004 suburban,after openning the packaging and installing discovered this is cap does not fit a 2004 suburban...fyi..not sure what to do with the cap now..don't believe i can return it since i cut open the plastic bag it came in...
1,A low point for Barry Unsworth,I am a great fan of Barry Unsworth and so I was quite disappointed in this book. It is so far below any of his other books. The plot is disjointed and some of the writing is actually silly. So sorry.
2,Inflating It???????,"I have been busy at work for the last week or so, so I've not had an opportunity to call the seller to ask how to pump up the Toner. My 18 year old son couldn't figure this out, either. If an explanation from the seller doesn't help, I'm sending it back."
2,Meh,"I was quite disappointed in this book, the main storyline was pretty predictable and parts of the story was pretty illogical. There are also many useless characters and side stories that were involved. They were underdeveloped and quite frankly I dont understand why they were included at all. Save your time reading something else"
4,Good quality,I am very happy with this purchase. I was able to install it myself with the help of my 8 year old son. The finish seems very durable and makes my truck look good. I already had them on my truck for a few months and still looks great. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the black end caps are made of cheap rubber and do not come with any glue to stick them on the ends of the bars so I already lost one at the carwash. However the bars are round at the ends so you don't even need them but some people may like to install them so either built them in or don't include them at all with your product.
4,Nice Side Steps,"These Side Steps are really nice for the price, they look great on the TrailBlazer! Easy installation BUT don't bother using the black end caps, they don't fit, you would have to glue them on..... They front is hidden under the vehicle and they rear is rounded and looks fine without the cap. I do recommend these, they are easy on the wallet and add a great look!"
4,Fight - 'War Of Words' (Epic),"As most of you do know,Fight was,of course the band that Rob Halford formed after twenty years of fronting Judas Priest,along with Priest drummer Scott Travis.Bassist Jay Jay and guitarists Brian Tilse&Russ Parrish round out the group's line-up.The killer tracks are easy to spot here,like ""Into The Pit"",the in-your-gut ""Nailed To The Gun"",the heavily riffed ""Immortal Sin"",""Contortion"" and ""Reality,A New Beginning"".Plain and simple,a truly great '90's metal release.The follow-up to this effort,'Small Deadly Space' isn't as good.Thank goodness Halford has now rejoined Priest.I ALWAYS thought he would have,eventually."
5,As good as painkiller!!!,"This album really rocksI was sad about Halford leaving Priest but Welcome to FIGHTfrom Into the pit to Reality... no weak songsHalford is the voice of metal no other like himVery heavy, this album can teach the new kids a lot about the good musicbuy this albumeven the hidden track is good"
2,NO BIG DEAl,"Sorry, but no big deal here, other than good professional musicians. Halford suely tried to ""modernize"" his sound and wrote some intelligent lyrics, but the great ammount of aggressions is lost due to bad vocals. No wonder FIGHT lasted so few."
2,Fighting a Losing Battle,"There's something faintly hilarious about an early 80s metal icon who looks like Wallace (of Wallace and Gromit fame) trying to look tough, whilst dressed like he's auditioning for Rage Against the Machine. Rob Halford was the screamer with THE metal band to end all metal bands, Judas Priest. His mid-90s band Fight attempted to merge that pure metal sound of the 80s with a little of that belligerent hardcore approach of the 90s. If you get off on twiddly, searing, metallic riffs, chanted choruses, and vocals that, for the most part, veer from a growl to a scream, then this is probably for you."
3,convenient,"Thanks Amazon for making these available. Cant believe the local stores no longer handle them. I buy these a couple waist sizes larger than normal since they do tend to fit tight, but also to make room for sweatshirt. The thing i don't understand is why the inseam is always too long requiring them to be rolled up or altered."
4,Made a little small,Very good quality but made a little small. I would suggest ordering the next size up!
3,Highly overrated,"My first and last pair of Dickies. They are very comfortable but they are poorly made.The zipper stop was missing from one side of the zipper, the first time I zipped up it would notunzip. Un-trimmed threads every where. Perhaps they should have been made in China instead ofMexico, younger eyes (or eye)."
5,GREAT quality,"Very fast shipping and great quality item.i ordered them a little large,but i believe I can shrink them some.but being a big man it is hard to find a good quality item that doesn't cost a $100.Thank you so much and i will order from you again."
4,oversized?,"So the size/shape is overall pretty good, but there's a really strange amount of extra space at the sides that make a really strange look..."
5,Dickies bib overalls,They were a gift for my boy friend. He loves them and wears them as soon as they get washed. They are well constructed and I think they will last longer than the ones he usually wears.
3,"Apparently works for some cameras, but not mine","Simply put, the lens seems to be decent quality, but unfortunately it doesn't work well with my Aiptek Action HD GVS. I could not get the image into focus. The Aiptek does not have manual focus, so I was limited to what the auto-focus would give me, or the macro mode. Neither gave me what I needed, so I had to return it. On a side note, the return process through Adorama was totally painless."
1,Eviews,"I have been using this workbook for undergraduate econometrics. E-views student version is a cut-down version of the 3.1 E-views program.The workbook is the companion to Undergraduate Econometrics Hill, Griffiths and Judge and the examples used in the workbook are those contained in the textbook.Unfortunately the workbook does not explain how to adapt the examples of other work. As the E-views program has complicated syntax which needs deciphering, the workbook was not much use for practising econometrics outside the examples in the text book.The workbook does not contain an index."
1,Will cloud the water,"I started using this product shortly after changing the lamp in my aquarium. When the water clouded, I immediately blamed the lamp thinking that it was causing algae to bloom. I switched to a lower intensity lamp, same thing. I tried massive frequent water changes only to have the tank cloud within a couple of days. I turned the tank light off completely, for a week. Same thing. This went on for weeks.Then I realized that the food could have something to do with it. I purchased some Tetramin flake food, the good old standby. Between that and a water change the tank was crystal clear in a matter of days. It has remained so for three weeks now."
5,The perfect tropical fish food!,"I've been using this for years, in fact ever since it first came out some 10 years ago. Despite one of the other reviews, used properly it does not cloud the water. Unlike regular flake food, all the nuggets are exactly the same smallish size, making it much easier to gauge how much to use, and you can use it with just about any community type tropical fish. It's extremely easy to use especially compared to flake food, and the amazon price is the best I've seen."
3,3 Bearing couplers usually leak,My experience with these and other 3 bearing couplers is that they usually leak as the male fitting is moved side to side. Look for 4 bearing couplers to eliminate the leak.
5,Good looking outdoor storage,"I was looking for a storage box to put outside by my front door so I wanted something useful but also attractive, and something people could sit on when they're waiting for me. This storage box met all requirements, and I love everything about it."
3,Thanks but,"The container that I ordered is nice a little difficult to put together because the instructions are a little difficult, but when I got to the front panel it was discolored. The top portion was one color and the bottom was another. when I called Amazon there answer was sorry you can return it but there is no more. After it took me an hour and a half to put together there answer was sorry but... Thanks"
1,Did not last one year,"I purchased this item last year from another retailer - but it is the same item. I kept it on my deck through the winter since it was an all weather wicker. However, this year, all the wicker straps on the top cracked and fell apart. I am trying to get a new top but am having difficulty. Anyway, do not leave it out during the winter or it will fall apart."
2,Can't take the sun.,I bought this for storage for pool toys. After the first year the top completely disintegrated. I also have a dining table and chairs like this and have had the same problem with it. I would not reccomend it.
2,not for wide feet,"I purchased these jessica simpson flats and they are definitely not for my wide feet. That's not because they do not fit, but they look ugly on me. The leather is so soft and it shows any flaws other shoes would normally hide. To be specific I normally wear 7.5 or 8 in medium width in other brands. Unless the shoe fit is extremely narrow, medium widths do fit me well. In this model I got an 8 blue pair to be on the safe side and I realized that 7.5 would fit better in length. But in terms of width they do look ugly. I missed the return period and am stuck with these shoes. Probably will be wearing them around home as slippers. They do look comfortable, but no arch support and overall cheap looking. Would not recommend if you don't have narrow feet."
1,I was fooled!!,"This was not identified as green leaf Stevia. Do not buy Stevia unless it is stated as ""white powder"". Don't be fooled!"
3,....,WHO would buy this? What a dumb doll! Her hair makes her look like SpiderWoman or something. Mattel has done better-check out the Happy Family and My Scene lines instead.
1,Not an arm blood pressure monitor,"This monitor was advertised as an arm blood pressure monitor when, it actuality, it is a wrist blood pressure monitor. I am returning it."
1,Haven't read the book,"I have read about von Richthofen and his squadren and his life, just not from this book. My review comes simply from the title, I would never read a book so obviously slanted to label people he killed in war as victims, they were there to kill people to and if they had the chance would have shot him, and eventually they did kill him. Civilians are victims in wars, soldiers are casualties. Richthofen killed soldiers, not civilians."
1,Just about the worst thing I've ever heard,"Let me start off by saying I DO like death metal, but this band is a pile of steaming you know what. You cannot understand a word this guy says, I even looked at the lyrics, and with them right in front of me was in disbelief that he was actually saying what the lyrics claim he was saying. This basically sounds like someone's head being flushed down a toilet, very muffled, and very indecipherable. At least most death metal you can make out a word or two....but forget it on this one, you might as well listen to channel 1 on your tv with static all night. Pure garbage. When will these bands learn, if you want to be controversial and known for it, then you make you work coherent enough for others to understand it!"
2,should've spent more,"phone:poor microphone design means phone must be held directly in front of your mouth. 1 inch off, and no one can hear you.range is poor. I can move one room away and still hear ok, but not two. changing channels doesn't help.answering machine:""mmrgblgh wgaher mmgnhr"" this is how about 25% of the messages get recorded, at a volume too quiet to hear anyway.too bad, the last vtech phone I bought was great."
3,Predictable but watchable,"With a very good cast (Sandra Bullock as a demanding boss, Ryan Reynolds as her long-suffering right-hand man, Mary Steenbergen as his mom, Craig Nelson as his dad, Betty White as his grandma)this romantic comedy delivers few surprises and no uproarious laughs, but decent acting.It starts in NYC where Reynolds is pursuing his true love: writing (or is it editing? or both? Who cares). The plot contrives to throw both of them on a sudden vacation to his family home in Alaska where they must pretend to be engaged and naturally, being a romantic comedy, they have to move from pretending to realizing...It's cute enough and if you want a plesant movie with an upbeat ending that does not require much thinking and is rather family friendly (it's pretty mild compared to some PG-13) this should be your cup of tea. Or make that a hot coffee (It's Alaska after all)"
5,too funny,I am a huge Sandra Bullock and Betty White fan. Teaming them together in this movie was genious. Sandra gets better with age in her acting and Betty has always been wonderful. This movie will make you laugh and make you cry and make you tell your friends to see it if they never have.
4,Funny movie,"Watched this while chillin over the holidays, great fun. Sandy B does a bang up job as a boss from h*ll. Reynolds matched her comedic skill look for look, barb by barb. They are two very funny actors. Betty White of course steals every scene she's in, man she's a riot. The Proposal has tons of laughs, some wickedly funny scenes and while I find the ending a bit Hollywood, it's still entertaining. Recommended!"
5,LOVE IT!,"I think I own just about every Sandra Bullock dvd out there,but this is one of my favorites! I absolutely love this movie! The dvd i recieved was used,but like new,it was a great price,and shipping was fast! I'm very happy!"
2,Great Actress Bad Movie,This is a typical Sandra Bullock movie which is a little tiring. I love Sandra but she needs to have better roles; she's getting older. Give her older roles; she's not a spring chicken anymore. Same plot over again. Give something new and refreshing. Would not recommend this movie!
3,A little surprised,I was hoping for a nice family movie. A little too much nudity. I think this should have been rated R. It could have been a cute comedy but thought it was a little too sexual.
2,Good movie but...,"The seller did a great job in packaging the product well and getting it to me quickly.Apon opening the dvd case, I found the dvd to be in excellent condition as stated by the seller.However, 3/4 of the way through the movie, it froze. Was able to skip to the next chapter buthad I not seen the movie before, I would have not known what I missed. I paid less than $2.00for the movie so as the saying goes, you get what you paid for."
2,Why Letterbox?,"If a DVD is in Letterbox format, why is it not so noted? I hate Letterbox and was very disapointed to see that this Blu-Ray was Letterbox."
3,The Proposal,It is a funny movie. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are good in the movie but Betty White makes the movie.
4,The Proposal,"The movie was a very thought provoking. You laugh,cry, and forget that you are watching a movie. Sandra Bullock was great as usual."
1,No electricity whatsoever,"I like Sandra Bullock and I like romantic comedies--so I ordered this movie. Big waste of money for me. Sandra Bullock had no charm for me whatsoever--it's like she delivered her lines deadpan. Not a trace of electricity between the two at any point. When they had their first ""serious"" kiss I was almost embarrassed for them, it was so perfunctory. On the same flight I watched Midnight in Paris (where we were flying to). It was awesomely beautifully filmed. Got the taste of The Proposal out of my mind."
3,Somewhat entertaining,"Worth watching for Betty White. Some good moments, nice Alaska scenery. Not the best product from Bullock or Reynolds. Fairly common themes throughout."
4,Great movie !!!,"This is great movie. You can't get any better than Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. I have watched it several times, and it keeps me laughing time after time."
4,Comedy,"Saw Sandra's interview and I couldn't wait to see this movie because of her comment ""Betty White was my best 2nd base ever"". This will keep you laughing."
4,Funny and wonderful story,"It was entertaining and was well performed by Sandra Bullock, I do not buy very many DVD but without question this was worth the price and I am glad we have it in our house to view on any day and for anyone in our family."
5,A brilliant book that makes me laugh,"I came across ""Life's a Stitch"" while browsing through the humor section the other day, and saw so many names of writers and performers on the cover whom I already enjoy. So, how could I not buy a book that contained all of them together in one volume.I have been enjoying each and every piece, and laughing out loud more than I thought possible. The variety in the book is wonderful. There are short stories, lyrics to very funny songs, and so many terrific cartoons. I even enjoyed reading the bios in the back of the book!!This is a book that would make a perfect gift for friends and loved ones, and I plan to buy quite a few for mine. I also like knowing that the contributors are donating their royalties to charity. It's a great concept, and this is wonderful book.Laura"
3,A bit of everything but sections not sufficiently developed,"The ""meat"" of this book is largely composed of two portions: a compilation of technological developments in the WCDMA field, with emphasis on physical layer techniques, and another of information found in the standards. The book is definitely not entry level, despite the inclusion of introductory sections on wireless comms and CDMA in general. Furthermore, as the more advanced chapters are rather skimpy on details, readers may have to refer to the references provided for better understanding. Anything that does not fall under the gamut of the physical layer seems to be given peripheral treatment, in spite of the all-embracing title.My opinion is that better resources for WCDMA can be sought for elsewhere, irregardless of the aspect of interest."
2,"May be flushable, but do NOT degrade quickly!","We just had our sewer line back up into our house. While the plumber was snaking the sewer cleanout, he extracted several ""flushable"" baby wipes, which had not degraded at all. They appeared to be in perfect condition, actually. Consumer reports recently tested some of the other brands, which didn't even break down after three months in water. For comparison, toilet paper breaks down in one minute. So while they are very convenient for kids, they are not good for your plumbing. Buyer beware."
1,Kandoo Easy-Use Tub not airtight,The re-usable storage tub is poorly designed and poorly manufactured. The hinged lid does not seal. The top one or two wipes are dry within hours. Another example of a product that never should have been. Complete junk like this certainly gives Pampers a bad name in my book.
1,Contains Factual Inaccuracies,This dictionary contains factual inaccuracies and so while the format is good I can't recommend it.
5,Helene Brenner's Excellent Book,"Helene Brenner's book ""I Know I'm in There Somewhere"" is outstanding and please note, it is not just a book for women. Dr. Brenner, in clean, clear, crisp english presents a holistic way for men and women to examine their lives from a feeling, knowing, sensing, and wanting perspective. By acknowledging these important parts of ourselves, and listening to our Larger Selves, we can begin to claim a graceful lifestyle that we all, by the mere fact of being here, deserve, and we deserve it now."
3,meat saw,THis is a good meat saw but could use some improvements. The blade is a little on the wimpy side and needs to be stronger. THere needs to be better instructions on assembly also. Other than that this is a good meat saw.
3,Barbra on 5 songs: worth the price!,"Tribute album to an old Broadway favorite managed to catch a young Barbra Streisand on her early rise to fame(what was she?...Nineteen?). She's delightful on ""Doin' the Reactionary"" and ""Status Quo"", but her big number ""Nobody Makes a Pass at Me"" sounds as if it were written especially for her. She makes these songs her own, even though they were not from her generation. Far removed from the current era, it's amazing that ""Pins & Needles"" still sounds fresh and lively."
2,"Biased, but good","This documentary highlights the predatory lending on the financial side and the monetary carelessness on the consumer side that is leading to an inflation of prices and a catastrophic debt problem. This was a great documentary that indulged in undeserved demonization of republicans and glorification of democrats. The conclusion advocates a communist redistribution of wealth. The national debt is frightening and overwhelming, but more government spending in a different direction is only escalating the problem! It should have included what happened in the 1920s leading up to the market crash and the Great Depression, so that people could get an idea of the end game possibilities here, rather than promoting a defunct political theory."
5,EYE OPENING to the world of predatary lending,"I am a financial planner and it amazes me to the number of families that are financially struggling to make ends meet and living paycheck to paycheck, to an extent, theres a level of responsibility that is required and many can make the claim that borrowers are the ones that lack the discipline to borrow with responsibility but we also live in a society and culture that promotes the opposite.Throughout life, everywhere we look, its buy this spend that! It becomes programed in our heads at an early age that we make MONEY for the purpose of spending it right away. I hope that after people watch this film that they review their own day to day financial habits and realized to start SAVING for a change because the corporations are out to make a profit and not looking out for the consumers best interest.I've recommended this film to my clients and definitely gives a reality check."
3,A bit one sided,"Saw this movie last night. While it was enjoyable (I really like the documentary style of story telling), I did find the personal responsiblity side overlooked. Then at the very end, it read ...in association with ACORN, or something like that. This is the same group that pressured congress into the whole Freddy Mac/Fannie May fiasco that we're dealing with now. The same group who almost got BILLIONS of dollars in this crazy bailout that our grandchildren will still have to pay. Thanks to those in congress who took that handout away from ACORN. They are B. Obamas biggest contributor (and why not, he was once their lawyer). They are involved in voter fraud galore, and many in their organization have gone to jail. As with everything else, buyer beware. Just quit asking your fellow citizens to bail you out when you make a bad decision."
2,Not the greatest,"read reviews and thought this would be suitable for my needs. Upon using this for a couple months, I wish I would have spent more money to get a quality light meter."
5,only toy to ever survive!,"This is the ONLY toy my rottweiler has ever had that has survived his wrath! If you spend loads of money on the so called ""durable"" dog toys meant for ""aggressive chewers"" and the toy lasts 10 minutes, then THIS is the toy for your dog!! Dogs can chew forever on it without destroying a thing....highly recommended for ""destructive dogs...!"""
1,IF YOU'RE DOG IS A TRULY AGGRESSIVE CHEWER THIS ISN'T IT!,"I have had dogs all my life and thought I had some aggressive chewers in the past, until I got my present girl...Lab, German Sheppard, and Pit mix. She can make short work of anything and this only lasted 10 minutes until she chewed the end off! It's back to Nyla bones...she even does them in, but it takes longer."
4,My dog loves this one,I have a 3 year old pit bull. He loves to chew. This is the second toy like this that I have bought like this and he loves it. He eventually picked this other one apart little by little. But we had it for a while before I had to throw it out. My dog can destroy most toys so I rate it good if its last in my house for 6 months or more! I would buy again!
1,not liked by our 3 dogs,"This toy is just ignored by our three dogs. They seem to like chewing on harder plastics, or on balls that spring back as they chew. Odd that a small terrier, a lab mix and a Great Dane all think it's boring. Usually one of the three like a toy - and then, of course, all of them want it!"
3,Friendly reading,"If you wondered why the Prisoner's Dilemma is a Dilemma or why the Theory of Games is more than a game, you should read this book. This book shows the interesting things that you can usually find in the American Books, for example, how the game theory instruments, that we usually study in a regular economics course, have been initiated with the atomic bomb and the cold war."
2,Meh...,"First off, this book isn't _bad_. It's just that after reading it,I was entirely unable to say what it was about.The problem is that I was sufficiently familiar with the topic thatthis book had nothing new in it for me; it quoted the same sourcesthat I'd read the originals of twenty or thirty years ago.Hence, it all just blurred together with what I already new...no mathematics, more just review of history lessons.I'd recommend Poundstone's other books over this one. Especiallythe Big{er,est} Secrets series."
2,Disappointing and frustrating,"This book is not for anyone without prior structured programming language experience. The editors did a terrible job in proofreading the book which leads to confusing statements, e.g., the last sentence in listing note 2 on page 72, the first word should be ""When"", not ""Then"". The object of each code listing is not always explained so the reader sometimes has to guess at what the code is trying to do, e.g. listing 6-9 on page 80. Related to that, the function arguments used are not explained so the reader has to compare the usage to the reference manual or online help to understand why those particular arguments were used."
4,Why?,"Why go thrash? This guy can't sing thrash! They sound more like Ganglion and that's how they should've released it as. The guy didn't use vocal distortions in the good old deathmetal days to make his voice sound deeper, he actually can sing like that. His vocals this time however seem, well boring. I want my old Extol back. Not that I don't like change, but instead if getting better, they got worse. Oh well Ole's singing makes up for it I guess."
5,A great ride with Paul in Alaska!,"This is one of several BtBoP workouts that we now own and they are all fantastic. This was a great workout and we actually felt the thrill of riding in Alaska, even out here in far West Texas. There were some problems with having to wipe water off of the camera lens but after all, it rains in Alaska! As with all of Paul's workouts, you have to keep yourself honest because there's no coach there yelling at you to ""keep it up"". All that you need to push yourself into a hard workout is there on the screen. If you try to match the intensity level showing on the screen, you are definitely going to be sweating and you'll know at the end of the workout that you've worked hard.The only thing that we sort of wish is that there was a time indicator on the screen showing how much time is remaining in the workout.Thanks for the great ride, Paul. We loved seeing the bear!"
4,Great for kids who don't tolerate a restaurant highchair,"My 20 month old son absolutely hates those restaurant highchairs. But with this booster seat, he loves to sit up to the table just like everybody else. It's easy to carry into a restaurant using one of the chair straps as a shoulder strap, then just strap it onto a regular chair. We went on a trip to the next state recently, and this was a lifesaver. Everywhere he ate, we used this booster: the hotel, the grandparents, restaurants. The only ding I would give it is that sometimes the plug on the inflatable cushion doesn't stay pushed in. Perhaps I didn't push it in hard enough. But it's not really that big a deal, as it doesn't raise him up that much anyway even when fully inflated. The important part is that he's strapped into the chair."
5,I remember,"Being on the same ward as Wendy I remember how she suffered. It was heartbreaking seeing this girl become a nobody with her thoughts and memories disappearing day after day. Havn't spoken to her in years but hope she is doing fine. If anyone hears from her tell her ""Jack"" says hi."
5,Wonderful,I use this cream in conjunction with MD Forte Replenishing Hydrating Cream. I usually use it on my neck. Very little it needed and it is absorbed immediately. I love this produce.
4,Don't let the track number fool you.,"Although, I love the song ""Beast of Blood"", looking at the track list on Amazon, I stupidly though there were 21 tracks on this CD. There ARE 21 tracks, but 4 through 20 are blank, 3 second tracks. At first I was pissed. Then I heard track 21. The ""hidden track"". Oh, my God. Imagine the most beautiful woman in the world, and making love to her, in an open field, during a full blown thunderstorm. That's how awesome track 21 is. A little over-priced but I didn't mind."
2,slightly unnessasary,bag was shipped immediately. seems like they were happy to get rid of it. when metal detector came i took it apart and it did not fit in the bag.unnessasary item.
3,ITS A Bag,Good bag. Ftts the metal detactor. Not very ridgid. Could use some additonal padding. It does hold all of additional accesories.
5,Bounty Hunter Bag,"I found the bag to be worth what I paid for it. If you want it stiff on the bottom, just add stiff cardboard or better yet thin pliable plastic. I have more than enough room. The idea is not to stuff the bag full of ""stuff"". Travel light and cover more ground. Those pockets are the inside a large enough for a writing pad and to carry necessary items. I actually put extra straps on it to carry it like a backpack. Yankee ingenuity goes a long way. Good luck hunters!"
4,Vox150,"Bought at Walmart online for $19.98 dollars. I seen it listed online for $59 at various stores/websites. Purchased to use with my PS3 and cellphone. After charging, I got it working with my Samsung cellphone in no time. Getting is connected to my PS3 console took a little more time. It was recognized immediately in my console setup, but it took a few minutes to figure out how to get it configured for my online gaming portion of Resistance. Works as advertised. Very happy with my purchase based on performance and the price I paid for the unit."
5,"A wonderful book about a great ""little brown dog""","This book is a ""must read"" for anyone seriously considering adopting a Boykin. It is comprehensive, describing in great detail the history and characteristics of the breed. The authors' love for these dogs is apparent, and one can not help but develop an affinity for these dogs as one becomes more familiar with them. Appendices provide helpful resources for finding breeders and additional information, and numerous pictures are provided. ( My only complaint is the occasional grammatical/spelling error that could've been omitted with better proofreading.) When a reader finishes this book, he/she will clearly understand the strengths and weaknesses of the breed and be able to make a well-informed decision whether to pursue purchasig this dog."
2,Odelia Clog,"I was disappointed in these. I was trying to replace a pair of Tommy Clogs...the Joanne... These had less comfort and could only be worn for short periods. The pair I was trying to replace could be worn all day, on your feet."
4,wrong color,the shoe is compfortable and at a good price $40. the color in the picture was what i wanted but not the one i received. i decided to keep it anyway.
2,1 1/2 stars really,"I bought this book because I thought there would be more material concerning fantasy. Aside from the chapter ""Turtles all the Way Down"" there is little to do with fantasy, some chapters even have passages along the line of ""fantasy maybe, but we're talking about sct-fi.""There are also several mixed messages. One chapter says ""Show, don't tell"" and the next chapter says ""Tell, don't show."" The book as a whole doesn't agree on issues of the importance of plot v. characters as well.And this book needs revisions to be useful for readers and writers of the 21st century; typewriters seem obsolete and there are no websites listed. Its a very dated book."
3,A pretty good soundtrack to a great movie,This soundtrack is essentially the music featured in the great Redford/Streisand movie. It features two different versions of The Way We Were. A big plus is that the score was done by Marvin Hamelisch of The Sting fame.
1,Not available for Android,"I did not like the fact that it was only for my kindle and not my Kindle for my Android device, being a magazine it would've been nice to see it in a color device"
2,Where's Isaacson's piece on newspapwes?,"I bought tthe Feb. 16 issue because he talked about i on Charlie Rose.It also was menioned in ediir R.S.'s piece in the magazine. What's the rationale,?"
2,Ever wondered why time on the kindle is so cheap?,When reading Time on the kindle you benefit from the great journalism just as much as with the paper version. Except when the text refers to the (nearly always) unreadable tables and figures. In that case it is guesswork. This happens several times in every issue.Ever wondered why time on the kindle is so cheap? Now you know.
1,available,"come on TIME magazine...i want to subscribe...but i have a kindle fire! Available on all other types of kindles,,,how come not the fire?"
1,No Time magazine on Kindle Fire,"I've subscribed to Time magazine for 25 years. Get with it Time. Are you kidding me I can't get Time on my new, amazing Kindle Fire? What gives Time? Come on already, get with the program. You've lost this subscriber over my not being able to get your magazine on my Kindle Fire. Come on Time. I'm not asking for much here. It's the little things."
3,The missing illustrations aren't quite the problem,"Well, I mean, yes they are, if that's the sort of thing you like. What creates a problem for me with regard to the artwork is that there are numerous times where the text will refer to an illustration or chart that isn't there. That's the part that bugs me, because the effort to digitize the whole magazine for the Kindle overlooks the fact that once in awhile you may NEED the accompanying artwork. Tables, for instance, are converted to text and are basically unreadable unless you really want to study them.Time also has a quick overview of events (it's called ""Pop Chart"") of the week which are laid out on a scale from ""Shocking"" to ""Shockingly Predictable"". We get this scale as a list, so we don't really get the feel for the scale itself.But graphics aside, you do get the entire magazine and a good depth of coverage on some of the bigger issues that you wouldn't get in a daily newspaper."
1,Huh?,"Even with low expectations I was still disappointed in this. And now a price increase??....$36 per year for the inferior Kindle version, or $20 per year for the full color physical magazine with photos and illustrations? Huh??"
1,No Pictures!,"I cancelled this subscription the moment I saw the first ""issue"". It's more like a text-only download of the magazine. I was severely disappointed at its implementation. Initially I had hoped to transition my physical magazine subscription to the Kindle, but I like the graphics and format exponentially better than the Kindle version."
4,"Good price, indeed","It seems many people don't understand basic English, or basic mathematics.To my surprise, so many TIME readers would have complained about the Kindle version being priced higher than the printed. Well, whether $2.99 per MONTH is more expensive than $1.99 per ISSUE is quite an intelligently challenging question to these readers.I suppose the readers of TIME should be more than that."
4,Not a bad read!,This was my first Octavia Butler book and I enjoyed it. I'm not sure I'll continue this series but I would like to read another book by Octavia Butler.
3,Textbook definition of average,"Wild Seed is about as average as they come. The book is not bad, but it really isn't all that good either.I can't say there was much action in it... not much romance... not really much of anything except two immortals arguing about breeding and killing people.Of course, the book itself is of secondary concern, You are probably thinking that the most important question is whether I, Moondonkey, would prefer to have the power of Doro or Anyanwu. A choice between living your life in a single body that you can manipulate and heal, or the ability to ""jump"" from body to body like Doro - but no ability to heal or change. Anyanwu has the advantage in the body department, but Doro has the advantage in the immortality department.So what is the answer? Neither. Accepting either choice would be a step down for me. Frankly, I suspect that Doro or Anywanu would choose to be Moondonkey if they had the choice."
5,IMPALED,"THIS IMPALED CD IS GREAT. I LOVE THE COVERS OF DEADBOLTS ""THE HEARSE"" NIRVANAS""TOURETTE'S"" AND I HAVE THE EUROPEIN VERSION OF THIS CD SO IT HAS FOUR BONUS TRACKS. ""NIGHTSOIL"" AND ""UNTIL DEATH..."" WAS FROM THE CHOICE CUTS EP AND THE COVER OF CARCASS""CARNEOUS CACOFFINY"" AND IMPETIGOS ""I WORK FOR THE STREETCLEANER"". BOTH CARCASS AND IMPETIGO COVERS WERE ALSO ON THE CHOICE CUTS EP AND A CARCASS AND IMPETIGO TRIBUTE CD. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE ""RAISE THE STAKES"" ""GROSS ANATOMY"" AND ""CHOICE CUTS"". THIS IS PERFECT FOR ANY DEATH METAL FAN AND FANS OF CARCASS. BUY IT"
4,Excavator,I purchased this for my 4 year old nephew who adores construction vehicles and plays with them in the sand. He loves this excavator and I highly recommend it.
2,Stiff,"A stiff, uptight and academic take on the life of the great artist. Dull black and white plates adds to the dated and lifeless text. Still, makes you only want to learn more."
4,By far the BEST DVD you can buy to improve your running style,"This DVD saved me and has brought back joy to my running. I purchased the book first and while it has excellent info, I'm a visual learner and seeing it on this DVD made all the difference in the world. I'd still recommend you buy the book, but this DVD is all you need to get started.Results for me have been about a 20 second gain in my average pace for a tempo run I do on fairly regular basis to judge how my training is going. It's also made a significant reduction in the soreness I had been getting in my lower legs and my knees never bother me anymore.Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is becuase there is still room for improvement in both deeper explanation of more advanced subjects he covers in the book and I think the author could be more lively in his delivery. That said, it really is an excellent tool and the best thing I have found yet on how to run injury free and faster."
4,Very informative and helpful,"This program has helped me improve my posture while walking/running, and reduced knee pain and other problems I encountered when training for long runs."
4,Following in the trail,"After reading this book I had to return to the scene of the crime.As a lover of Provence, I headed first to the local cafe in Maussane where all the regulars discussed this terrible misdeed.I eyed every gypsy suspiciously, wondering if they were the culprit. After a few more Pastis, I thought about the day he was finally returned to his loving home. Yo-yo in Provence is in my heart."
2,Very disappointing.,"I really looked forward to this book, since the recipes I had encountered from Evelyn Rose all seemed delicious. What a disappointment this book has turned out to be. I found most of the recipes to be labor-intensive, overly rich, and not very appealing. In the back of the book are some menu suggestions that are helpful, but I'm baffled as to why some holidays have extensive suggestions, while others are completely neglected. This is not a cookbook for someone who wants to create elegant meals that allow you to actually enjoy your guests and the holiday at the same time."
5,Grand master of American popular song wows us again...,"Tony's voice in 1993 when this was recorded is noticeably aged when compared to his 1960's hits, but since this is a tribute to Fred Astaire, and Tony at 100 will probably still have a better voice than Fred ever did, the disc works beautifully. A lot of credit should go to Ralph Sharon for his musicianship and to the producers as well. The 18 songs luckily include a bunch which have not become all-time classics, but rather served the Astaire movie or show in which they were placed. There are plenty of famous songs here, but the lesser ones add a lot of interest because who else would release them in this century if not Tony? Read the other reviews for detail on people's favorites. I like the product a whole lot, and recommend it to all."
1,For the kindle version,"This review is a reflection on the kindle edition of the book, not of the story or the author.I have never seen as many typos and errors in any published book or ebook.. Ever.I bought another Danielle steel novel as I have other kindle books that are fine, so I thought maybe it was a problem with just this book, but there are quite a few errors in the other novel as well.. So maybe the problem is with the conversion of Danielle steel novels?Regardless, since the price is the same as the published book, those who are considering buying the ebook might may want to consider getting the book itself."
2,"Not as Advertised. Book contains 3 titles, not 1 as advertised.",Book was ordered as Thurston House. It was to be placed in a collection.Book that was received contains Thurston House plus 2 other titles.It is not as advertised. Description did not state 2 other titles werein the book. It is not what was ordered.
3,Cautious Note,The book introduction states that the sample applications require installation of Visual Studio Enterprise edition and will not work with Visual Studio Professional.
2,covers basics glosses over SQL CE,"This book gives a fair basic overview of the .net CF. Examples in both VB and C# are helpful to those making the switch. However, it glosses over SQL CE in one chapter with no sample code and says nothing about replication."
5,Much better than the stock hot shoe mounts,If you want a secure and easy to use hot shoe mount for your flash and light stands then this is the product to have. Easily adjusts to all hot shoe flash units and is super secure. No slipping or falling out of this mount.
3,No as it was expected,It is perfect to put it in your speedlite. But my problem is that I asked for two and one works perfect but the other does not fit in. The size to put it in the stand is different and I cannont use it.It is perfect to never damaged your speedlite electronics.
1,Still Cheating People,"I usually read reviews in depth, but didn't think I had to with such a little simple product, but lo and behold, I should have: Adorama pictures the Stroboframe Bracket Shoe Mount with the red knob and says it's by Tiffen, then sends the Flashpoint version. Nothing new so apparently Amazon continues to tolerate the misrepresentation. Shame on you both."
4,"Funny movie, but...","We've seen this movie a couple times from rentals, etc and decided to purchase it ($6) to have in the collection since we like it so much. However, we watched this DVD the other night and this version is missing a couple of funny scenes. I'm not sure if we rented a director's cut, extended feature or what previously but I feel like this DVD is lacking slightly. Had I not seen the other version(s), I wouldn't care as much but for $6 I can't complain too much either."
4,Very funny!,very funny movie. I really enjoyed it. I still think zoolander is my favorite but this money is worth a watch. I recommend it.
2,Don't waste your time on this one...Tropic Blunder,"I was really hoping with a cast like they had, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr, etc that this movie would be hilarious, but they missed the target in every way with this movie. I love these types of movies, but this one was a wreck from the start and I won't even comment on Tom Cruise's character... that bad. It should be called Tropic Blunder... you'll want to give it a chance but probably will want to turn it off after the first 30 minutes after you realize you haven't laughed once yet while watching a comedy! Give us something better Hollywood!"
4,Enjoyed most of it,"I liked the concept about a bumbling film crew in Vietnam making a war movie.Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Michael Downey Jr. do a fine job in this comedy.As the director, Stiller keeps it moving at a healthy pace.Worth a watch."
4,I enjoyed the flick and the extras,"This action comedy was very fun and overall a entertaining story line. A few of the extras that stand out include commentary with ben stiller, jack black, and a hilarious robert downey, jr. voicing as his character in the movie. Another interesting extra included are full reels of select moments in the movie; basically the actors performing variations of their lines over and over until the tape runs out. It was a new perspective for me that shows that even a fun movie like tropic thunder can be harder work for the actors than i previously imagined. Overall, a good movie and I learned something new about the movie making process."
5,"superb sound, superb picture, funny movie. Why you all hate on Stiller?","superb sound, superb picture, funny movie. Why you all hate on Stiller?Stiller and Stallone have something in common. Everybody hates them and sais the cannot act or are not funny. I think Stallone and Stiller are great actors in their own special way. This movie is so good and funny that I was shocked the moment I saw the feedback. Have you watched the same movie as I in whom Ben Stiller got shot like in Platoon, Downey is a black dude and action and fun is all over the movie?People please watch the movie and then decide for your self!"
4,Best comedy of the year in 08!!!,"Tropic Thunder is a pleasant surprise and gets a warm welcome on blu ray disc. This is hands down the funniest film of 08 although not for everyone. The comedy is very vulgar and extreme and if you get offended easily then you will not like this film. However, if you can look past that then you are in for a 120 minute joy ride of laughs and more laughs. The acting is stellar for a comedy(Robert Downey Jr anyone), and Ben Stiller's directing is also very top notch. The cinematography is nice to look at and this is a well made film. The story molds together elements of Platoon, Deerhunter, Rambo, and others, and creates one of the wackiest comedies in sometime. I'm usually not a fan of comedy but this is one truly not to be missed. The picture quality is 4.5/5 and sound is 4/5. Plus there are a ton of bonus features that are mostly shot in HD. A must own for blu ray."
4,Tropic Thunder Excellent But Could Offend the Politically Correct,"Tropic Thunder is not for the politically correct and this movie will offend those who are sensitive to jokes about the mentally challenged or handicapped. If this does not bother you then you are going to enjoy Tropic Thunder which is a parody of action movies and the movie industry. If you play along with the premise of the movie, that a Director would be allowed to send Actors in to a real life battle situation, risking their lives then you will enjoy this movie. Tom Cruise, Jack Black, Nick Nolte, Matthew McConaughey, Ben Stiller and Robert Downey JR. are in top form and there are plenty of laughs. Performances by Robert Downey JR and Tom Cruise are reasons alone for seeing this movie. Both actors are over the top and Cruise is like you've never seen him. The quality of the BluRay transfer is fine as it should be but if you are on a tight DVD budget you don't need to see this move in BluRay,"
2,Either the best bad movie ever or the worst good movie ever,There hasn't been a truly funny movie in a while and this movie blows most new comidies away. Which is sad givin I don't like it much. Its barely funny enough to have even made me smile. This movie has everything a good comedy should have exept for the most important thing. I didn't find it very funny. I prefer the new Year One which people say is bad.
1,Tropic Blunder,"Bad, bad, and bad. Even for Ben Stiller this goes too far. I saw the theater version, I can honestly say that I don't think I could take five more minutes of this movie. Gross out humor goes too far.. blood, guts, sex acts. Downey Jr does a decent job. Rent first or look in your local thrift store bins in 6 months."
1,This film STINKS!!,Lots of big names. Lots of raw language. Bad plot. Little worth taking the time to watch. Can these ratings go NEGATIVE stars?
1,Hollywood taking itself too seriously by mocking that it takes itself so serioiusly,"Granted, high hopes from the Robert Downey Jr hype, but pure gold ended up being (unintentional) camp & cheese.Kudos to RDJ for taking a gamble (could've easily gone sour & branded him a racist, sending him to rehab for racism). Innovative start w/ satirical fake previews (albeit, I'd seen that in the Family Guy 'movie'). Good surprise casting with the studio exec (but the makeup job was the only really funny part).In all, mildly entertaining. I just bottomed the rating because it fell way short of the hype machine."
2,Not very funny or entertaining,"I had high hopes after seeing movie critics praise this film. I found it mildy amusing at times, but most of the humor fell flat. It was a chore for me to watch the whole movie, I would recommend staying away from this film."
4,"""I don't break Character until I do the DVD commentary.""","Shockingly good picture quality for a comedy. In fact, it would be great for any genre. A satire of Hollywood convention, conceit, and phony sanctimony with demo quality visuals? Seriously -- most of it is that good. Fine natural grain throughout, didn't see any halos or ringing, blacks, shadow, and contrast extremely satisfying and well handled. Perfectly resolved ultra fine detail everywhere, three dimensional jungle scenery. It's true that there is a lot of tasteless humor here, but most of it is in the service of a larger point about Hollywood. I found it more of a consistent smiler than a laugher and some of the pee-pee-caca seemed a little gratuitous, but nit-picking aside, no matter what you think of the movie, are you looking for a comedy with demo quality visuals to show off your blu-ray set-up? You've found it here."
3,"OK movie, not as good as people say",This seemed like pretty much every Ben Stiller comedy. It was ok but not great. I wouldn't buy he dvd or watch it again.
1,Tropic Blunder,"We expected the best from a movie with Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr starring in it. We love Ben Stiller movies and we love movies with Jack Black - until this one. When I read the reviews, I was sure this was a winner of a comedy. From the head spurting blood to the head on the end of Ben Stiller's bayonet, we did not find one laugh. There were a number of times that I had to turn away from the movie, retching. When Ben Stiller tasted the goo from the head to prove it was sugar water, we turned the DVD off. This movie is NOT for squeamish folks. If anyone has the time, I would love someone tell me what parts are funny. Ben and Jack, shame on you for mistaking gore for humor."
1,total crap,"Robert Downey jr. was the only redeeming factor. That one star is for him. Everything else about this movie was as bad as tom cruise's character and just as ""classy"". It was too conflicted - the mixing of gore and Stiller's comedy just seemed like two separate movies that someone spliced together (poorly). Actors playing actors playing other actors... it almost worked."
2,This will have to be a cult classic but not a great movie,Some of the lines are hilarious and the Tom Cruze creepy dance in the last 10 minutes of the video made it worth sitting through this whole thing. It's a dude flick for sure.
3,Tropic Thunder is GREAT but Director's Cut.. Not So Much,"Tropic Thunder is one of my top 10 favorite comedies! But I was disappointed in the Director's Cut. The new scenes really didn't add anything new to the movie. They were more like...meh. It was crystal clear exactly why they were cut to begin with. And to even include the scenes where Robert Downey, Jr.'s makeup is running all down his face is just bad. Skip this one and go for the theatrical version!"
4,What a funny movie,I will question why the extended scenes were edited though. I think the extra disc is worth the purchase just for them alone esp. the scene where Lazarus comes across the incarcerated Tugman. Definitly a spoof of the Marlon Brando/Martin Sheen scene from Apocalypse Now. I picked this up for 7.99 making the choice for me a no brainer.The alternate ending though was not to my liking.
5,Zyliss Lock-n-Lift Manual Can Opener,Absolutely the best manual can opener I have ever used. I open all my cans with a manual type opener. The lock-on feature is the trick with this opener. The electric ones are a waste of money.
5,"Great can opener, comfortable, good price.","I've thrown away more can openers than I can count. I've had this can opener for over a year and it works great.I don't use the magnet feature so I can't comment on it.Snap the handles together when starting to open the can and the opener is locked so you only need to turn the lever; you don't have to apply a death grip to the handle to keep the knives shut. When can is open, click the red button to unlock the handles.Comfortable soft grips make opening cans even easier."
4,LOCK AND LIFT,THE LOCK AND LIFT CAN OPENER IS VERY EASY TO USE AND I CAN DO IT WITHOUT STOPPING VERY GOOD
1,Disappointed,"It worked well for a few cans but is now popping out on just tuna cans, in spite of the great (pain-in-the-neck) ""lock."" I can't get a single can opened without slopping the insides all over the counter because the thing loses its grip over and over. Way, way overpriced. I could have bought a cheap electric which would last a whopping 3-5 months for $4 more than what I paid for this. It was supposed to be a back-up but sadly . . ."
3,"Very good, but not GREAT","You must decide whether to buy this based on other reviews, too. It does work better than my old can opener, possibly because it is newer. The magnet on this doesn't work on our dog food cans--the magnet is totally tiny.The comfort grip handle is definitely a plus.So, in conclusion, I like this can opener and haven't at all considered sending it back. But it isn't magically wonderful."
4,great can opener,This is one of the coolest can openers out there.It locks on so it won't slip and not open the can.Very happy with this can opener.
5,My wife is delighted!,"I had purchased a can opener that required practice, and a decoder ring to understand how to use it properly... After a LOT of practice, it works just fine, however my wife was not interested in the learning experience... this Zyliss can opener broght peace back into our kitchen!"
1,A Bad Choice,"This is a side-cutting can opener. This means that the top edge of the opened can is extremely sharp. When I tried to use it on a can with liquid, the liquid spilled on the countertop. I returned the opener to the store for a refund after one use."
3,Good...,"This can opener is supposed to have a magnet which captures the lid as it comes off the can. That doesn't happen; I don't think the magnet is strong enough. I like the Zyliss, however, in that it is good looking, and has no area where rust could develop."
2,"Good at first, now always jams","Was very happy for a few months, purchased it July 2012, now jams all the time. Gets jammed on can labels and when it gets stuck, have to unlock and start over. Same kinds of cans used all the time, sometimes it works all around one can, more often tho - it jams ... I did put in the the dishwasher, maybe that had something to do with it. Now looking for an opener that has a magnet that brings the can's top up instead of dropping into the product. Had one a long time ago, much better!"
3,Eh.,"It's a great looking design, and works smoothly, but I actually get annoyed by the locking feature--I don't think it serves much of a purpose and I guess I don't get the big advantage. It's not for me and will probably end up getting a different one as soon as I don't feel guilty about spending the money on this one."
1,never came!!!,DO NOT ORDER THIS ON AMAZON!!!!!! I placed the order- was charged- but it never came! I never had a problem with amazon! I contacted them and they were nice but had me contact acts and activities company who then told me they do not offer subscriptions anywhere except through themselves. so I was out $25 :( was not happy. this magazine is amazing though!
1,Not versality,Purchased this product because it was light weight and great to use. When I received the product there was nothing too it. The bracket was light weight but I could not shoot vertically with the bracket. This is not a functional bracket for professional photographers.
2,"less mess, bad color","I hare flake food. I have to crunch it up for the smaller fish and the bigger fish doesn't eat the smaller pieces. It makes the water yucky. Clogs up filter, etc. These flakes would be PERFECT except they turn the water filmy and red. And have turned our white and orange gold fish pink in his white areas. Not only that, but the water testz are showing a poor watwr quality now and the bigger fish is loosing scales (from poor water quality). Says on the bottle ""will not cloud water when used as directed"", but as directed is ""one crisp per inch of fish 2-3 times daily"". I dialed way back on how much we fed, but one crisp per inch was not enough. The fish became erratic and fought. They were obviously hungry. Too bad, this could be a great product idea if made properly."
1,Red Tide,"The flakes would be perfect if it wasn't for the RED DYE. It will turn you water red in a week or less guaranteed! You end up having to swap the water out many times until it reaches a more desirable slightly pink, repeat this process weekly. So unless you like swapping your tank water frequently, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
3,Love no matter what,"Anna Brinkman is a 50 year old widow, and estranged from her only daughter for the last 12 years. Her story follows a torturous path filled with love for her husband Hugh and anxiety over a child she did not want. Poppy, her daughter calls mysteriously out of the blue from Alaska wanting to visit, with her husband Marvin and their unusual daughter Flynn. Anna reluctantly agrees to let them back in her life. Flynn's eccentricity dominates at times. You never get the whole story about Anna and Poppy. Some scenes are beyond the scope of realism and you have to ask does this make sense? You do see the palatable changes in Anna as she learns to love Flynn. Frustratingly Poppy never appears in the story. When Jack needs help, Anna is there for him and Stuart. The writing is rough around the edges with explanations and information gone astray; but overall it is a satisfying read."
4,"If You Think Nsync, Bsb, 98 Groups Are Good Get This One","This is a good c.d. Trust me on this. It might be old but it is still better than Bsb,Nsync,98,5 all the other boy group bands. If you are a true pop fan you need to get this one!!"
2,Jackson family,I think this is good for die-hard 3T fans only! I bought the album cause I am the King of Pop true fan and would like to listen his part singing there.
3,"Wondeful story, but very poorly written","This book goes into great descriptions of the lives of russians with they trials and tribulations, and Hartje makes a decent attempt, but all in all, he's still a hockey player, not a writer. The books is poorly written. He skimps and jumps all over the place, and at times forgets what he as written, and talks about some things more then three times. If you want to know more about russian hockey traditions, this is the book for you, but if you're looking for good reading, this book is not it."
2,the CDs skip,Beautiful songs but the CDs started skipping right out of the case - not soothing for a lullaby! Wasted my money.
3,Not What I Expected from Playboy Review,"I bought this book because it was reviewed in Playboy magazine. Not at all what I expected. Playboy cleverly displays the best photos from the book and leaves all the weird S&M stuff unshown. Many of the women shown aren't even pretty. Maybe I don't understand what ""erotica"" is, but this book wasn't what I expected. A small book too, about the size of TV Guide but thicker. I just found the book to have too much bondage and S&M for my tastes. Some images might border on pornographic too, if that bothers you. Nothing really graphic though."
5,Through God's Eyes,"One of the greatest albums recorded by the Tommies yet. Being a professional gospel musician in Washington, DC and having the opportunity to open up on concerts with them, I wouldn't expect nothing less than the best from them. From the beautiful entrance of Thorugh God's Eyes to the explosive ending of Crown of Life, this is a CD to add to anyone's Gospel collection. I rate it 5 plus."
1,Boring. We All Hated It,"Both I and my students hated this book. We used it last fall and gave up on it in November. So boring. Why is it so tough to get good reading and writing textbooks? I liked the idea of bringing the reader's own experience to bear on the text, but in reality, it offered very little of that, and what it did offer was lecture-ie, deadly dull."
1,Not what I expected.,"This book was way over rated, probably because of who wrote it, I did not find anything in this book that I felt was helpful."
5,Miracle cure for insomnia avoid cheaper versions by other manufacturers,"Ok I have delayed sleep phase disorder causing chronic insomnia. I used the Litebook product recommended by my doctor. Sleep problem cured in 30 days with consistent use. What a miracle! I was on every sleep med took sleep studies. This thing cured me.I have used it since 2010. I lost it and foolishly tried the Philips version. It isn't as bright and guess what I don't sleep anymore. It's 230 am, I just placed my order for a second litebook because the Philips version doesn't work although I used it the same way. Note to cure this sleep problem you must get up at 7 am and look at it for 30 minutes every day forever. Sucks but I slept like a baby with my Litebook. never needed ambient gain. Also helps to take melatonin. This from advice of Fusion Sleep clinic in Atlanta"
4,Excellent and very sweet movie,"Lovely movie for all ages. Best suited for young kids, but even my 9 year old enjoyed it. Simple and has a great moral."
3,"Not the best around, but not too bad either.","If you are like me, you are probably too old to watch cartoons as a kid, and to young to watch 'em as an adult :) If you are like me, you really like to watch cartoons nonetheless. From that kind of view I rate this movie. I find the story overall a bit dull, it sometimes simply lacks emotions. However, the movie gets interesting when the bears get to Winkle's store. Personally, I really liked Jack, the Jack-in-the-box who's afraid of the dark. I watched it in Dutch, so I don't know how the English songs and voices are, but the Dutch voices are not too bad. For the little cartoon fans its definatly a good movie, and for the adults its a good movie to see with your kid. For those like me, its worth checking out, but there are better cartoons out there."
2,Read The Book,"To see a gorgeously drawn version of this story, read the book--with a colorfully unique palette and illustration style that will teach children about art as much as anything. The video version has none of that style--and its slow pace and ""dumbed-down"" generic look made me feel it was about 42 minutes too long. For originality on video, pick up Toy Story 2."
5,Typical SLED,"I found this SLED to be about the same as any other on the firing line, just a bit cheaper. It is a little difficult to insert, fairly easy to remove, and it takes a little practice to get the round in quickly. But it performs like all the others, allowing simple single round loading for competition or practice."
4,Great deal for the money!,"This isn't the fanciest tripod in terms of materials, or the most expensive you can buy if you're trying to impress someone else. What it is is functional, sturdy, light, well designed and a heck of a lot of tripod for the money."
1,Not a good reversal book.,"This book does not help you learn the tarot reversals in my opinion. The way the book is laid out, it makes it very confusing to try and learn the meanings. If you are a very advanced student of the tarot and want to read a book which gives many different meanings for each reversal, then this book may be for you. The book ""Tarot for Beginners"" by P. Scott Hollander offers better meanings for the reversals."
2,conversacion y confusion,"As a student who has used several different Spanish text books throughout the years, I found this book to be lacking, especially in regards to its structure. It splits concepts into different chapters unecessarily, which leads to frustration when it's time to write creatively. I found myself constantly looking ahead in the book to express ideas which used the grammar we were currently working on. The format for the subjunctive tenses were especially ill-conceived. I did, however, appreciate the insightful cultural vignettes. All in all, I would recommend the Valet books or Dos Mundos over Fuentes. I hope this was helpful."
4,Jim's Stereoworld is indeed SUPER!,"Jim's Super Stereoworld features Jim Bob, formerly of Carter USM. Carter USM fans won't be disappointed by this treat! After Carter USM slit up in '97, the boys went off in their separate directions and now have new projects. Jim Bob is Jim's Super Stereoworld which has great flavors reminiscent of Carter USM. The lyrics are clever and the music is solid pop!"
5,a true gem,"I too read this book quite quickly and enjoyed every word! I am going to give a copy to my Dad for Father's Day. I could hear Mike's voice as he described the ups and downs of dealing with aging parents, and more than once I found myself saying ""Amen!"" Prepare to laugh and cry with this bunch as you tag along on their ""trip of a lifetime."""
3,All rides get tiresome after a while,"I enjoyed the book in many ways. It jumped around a lot from past to present and it was a little hard to keep all characters identified. It was very human, though, and I especially enjoyed the story of the father going to Ireland alone when he was only 12. It was an enjoyable read but not a great book."
5,Great kids multivitamins,These were recomended by our child's Psychiatrist for our 6 year old who has ADHD and some eating issues. We give them to both our 6 and 11 year old children. We trust the production/purity of the vitamins. No added artificial colors or fillers. A must for most kids. Combined with Omega 3's it is all they need.
4,tonneau cover,Came in super record time and is just what we wanted as it fits with the sliding tracrack system for our extra shortbed = the only issue we can see right now is that at the very back where it meets the tailgate in the corners the rubber skirt part doesn't go all the way to the ends and lets some rainwater in in those corners. Wish the rubber skirt went around the corner to prevent that.
4,Great little air filter,"I bought this for my son's bedroom about 10 months ago to ease his allergies. He's been sleeping better ever since we turned the machine ""ON"". No more weezing and sneezing in the middle of the night. The air in his room is so fresh, it's like being in a museum! We hardly remember that the unit is turned on, except when it goes into ""odor busting"" mode when the fan runs at high speed. This doesn't happend too often, but it is noisy when it does happen. All in all, I'm very pleased. I only wish it came with the vacuumable pre-filter as the bigger models do."
2,It's Alright!,"It works ok, by my wife's opinion. She said it works fine, but after a while the red paint starts to burn and little by little it will start to peel off. But she says other than that it does straighten her hair out."
4,"Good, but one error",I bought this item thinking it would be the advertised pad in the picture but what I got was an Evans Realfeel. I would have returned it but the Evans was great. Just beware that you might not get the advertised product if you buy it.
1,Do not order this pad. I feel cheated.,I ordered this practise pad to give to my son for a special occasion. Amazon shipped me an Evans practise pad that is selling for half what this one costs. Looking at the other review it seems that Amazon makes a habit of doing this. It is not acceptable to sell someone something and then send them something else. I honestly feel that this was done intentionally. I believe that the shipper was hoping that I would keep the cheaper practise pad. When a customer orders a expensive item and is sent something of much lesser quality it is rediculous that I will have to wait 2-3 weeks after the incorrectly shipped item is returned and process. It will probably take 4 weeks to receive credit for this item. I offered to keep this item if amazon would refund the difference but they are evidently not able to do that. I feel cheated. I will NEVER order from this company again.
1,Garbage (would like to give it 0 stars),"First unit came out of box with cracked (falling apart) microphone (which had corroded batteries loaded inside). It was obviously a returned system that shipped out as new. Not the best quality control for Amazon.Second unit seems new, but if you attach antenna, extend it all the way out, charge the speaker to full, you can't go more than three feet from the unit without losing wireless connection or having horrible static. Wired mic is fine, but I bought this for wireless. There is nothing around to cause interference as I'm experiencing. This is a poorly made piece of equipment. No instructions either, which would have been nice to have to explain some of the knob functions. And for what it is, it is really overpriced."
3,"It's 20A...the plug is NOT C13, so be aware","Well, it looks so attractive to have 12 plugs on a single U in a rack. Just be aware that this PDU is not your average 15A unit with a regular US 110V AC plug on the end. It's a C15 plug, with the one blade to the side (not parallel like the C13). Talk about a showstopper. Oh well...I cut it off, went to Lowes and bought a replacement C13 plug...Everything works now without issues."
5,Dreatest Doll,"Dear Readers,This is one of the greatest doll you would ever see or own. It is fun and totally stylish! There are more of the Jamming in Jamaica dolls. (...)With all due respect,Jessica Simpson"
5,Lasting Perfection!!!!,"Nancy Wilson is like a fine wine, mellowing & perfecting with time. I could listen to her forever. Choose a song, any song.This cd is full of sophisticated musical journeys. From the opener, ""Love Dance"", you are on your way! Sample that hot song ""Day Dream"". Nancy makes it her own. ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" is gorgeous, fine and fulfilling. Nancy gives ""More Love"" depth and sincerity. ""Love Won't Let Me Wait"" is a real sensual knock-out! Nancy makes ""Magic Door"" a journey into a fantasy. The finale is a magnificent gospel song called ""Your Arms Of Love"".When Nancy Wilson sings a song, you feel as though she is singing it for only you. That's how personal it gets. The beauty of her voice is incomparable. This is a must for any Nancy fan!"
5,Nancy Wilson at her very best!!!!,"An extraordinarily gifted vocalist Miss Wilson has been making great music for almost 40 years. Although her choice of material was not always up to her technique, and occasionally vice versa. Her unique vocalizing, which blurs the lines between Jazz, Traditional Pop, R&B and Soul, are at times bold and expressive and at others shrill and overwrought.On ""Love Nancy"" she is absolutely exquisite. Just about every song is a glorious slam-dunk. Her version of Ivan Lin's ""Love Dance"" betters all others. Her aching ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" even surpasses Bonnie Raitt's original version. Billy Strayhorn's ""Daydream"" and Sondheim's ""I Remember"" are dreamy masterpieces. There isn't a single bad song on this CD. I have been listening to it since 1994 and it sounds better and better with the passage of time, just like Miss Wilson."
5,I'll never make flying geese another way...,"This is an amazing method for making fast and accurate flying geese. I have done it all the other ways I think that are available and this is the easiest with the least amount of fabric waste. The cutting directions for cutting the geese the final time need to be read slowly and maybe twice, but once you cut them the first time you'll have it down. I received this as gift and I'd highly recommend it to anyone searching for an easier way to make those wonderful geese that are so much a part of quiltmaking."
3,Stroboframe Accessory Shoe,"The description failed to describe the product clearly, particularly about the screw at the bottom, if it is a female or male. I received the unit on time but could not use it so I returned the unit."
2,a little disappointed,"I felt a little disappointed after having read all the reciepes and such. I was looking for a story. The story was good but not Francines best work. Her Mark of the Lion series, Voice in the wind, An echo in the darkness ect. had me on my knees several times petitioning Our Lord to have a spirit like the character Haddesa. Those books showed the world for what it truly is but also gave us the hope that can only come from being in obedience to God."
2,Not what I expected from Francine Rivers,The book was way to short. It had too many blank pages. It took me all of 10 minutes to read it. It felt like a lot was left out. In fact I thought it had so I downloaded the book again.It was not a discounted price either for such a short book. I am very disappointed.
3,A cute story with a good message,I love Francine Rivers' books. This one has less depth than most. It is a cute story with a good message.
5,"Very readable, well-researched book","The author recreates the ambiance of pre-WW 1 Europe, specially the Paris frequented by expatriate American writers, painters and poets. Always in a good-humoured way, but revealing extreme attention to details and preocupation with accuracy in every aspect, she gains the reader's respect and interest. A very good book by all standards. Lucien Castier"
4,Great little thing,"most say i got it, work great, no long have the camrea but i cord still works for other things, thank you"
1,Odd Barbie............,"I did kinda want to get this barbie once,but her arms and legs looked like noodles in the box at the store!this is the most strange barbie i have ever seen!"
3,DON'T USE THIS TO INTRODUCE A PERSON TO GROVER,"I'll give Grover Washington credit for playing the sax well. But the two best tracks are ""Soulful Strut"" and ""Can You Stop The Rain"". The rest of the tracks are so-so, but don't come close to the aforementioned two."
1,"Cheap, dont buy!","I bought this suit for my wife and soon after it tore at the seams. It split down the back of the pants when she sat down. The top shirt part was very tight around the neck for her so I started to use it and only after a few uses it split down the side when I took it off. It is a cheaply made suit and we have found a much thicker one at a local sporting good store made by the same company, Everlast. This suit is not a good buy and it does not fit all!!!"
2,A star for each day it lasted-2,"Well, what I thought would be a nice investment in a sauna suit turned into money down the drain. Or maybe I missed the warning-""Don't do squats in this suit"". Yes, I did a few squats in it and POW the whole back of my pants blew out. The suit is sort of air tight, so it fills up with air and when you bend down, you either get balloon pants or a blow out like I did. The good news is that it worked like a dream the first night I used it but it was hard to clean. You have to turn it inside out and wipe it down with a towel, then soap and water, and a towel again. If you are in a hury this suit will never do."
2,one size fits all pshh...,"Am a 180 6ft all I got to say is I haven't ship back a product so fast in my life! As soon as I open the package I have my doubts but soon my doubts were confirmed, The Fabric fells cheap and I was afraid I was going to tear it, I re-package it and sent it back and ordered another from a trustier source I think this should be called a medium size sauna suite"
3,Makes you sweat,"I purchased this to aid me in my weight loss. Its very flimsy and one thing I don't like about it is it makes you sweat so much that you have to wear something under is to keep it from sticking to your skin. If you wear a light t-shirt and gym shorts, you should be fine without getting too hot. Not too bad for 10 bucks."
1,one size does not fit all,"Very cheaply made and a real issue to get on and off. The elastics around the neck, ankles and wrist are very tight and itchy."
5,Tony Hillerman on Ice,"A nice murder mystery series with echoes of the Tony Hillerman Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn Navajo tales. If you liked those you'll warm to Trooper Nathan Active solving mysteries in the snowscape of Alaska's wilderness. I enjoyed Shaman Pass even more than his first installment - White Sky, Black Ice. The hardback editions are easy-to-read paperback-sized volumes."
2,Boring,"It is hard to get motivated to do the exercises. It is soooo boring. The excercises are explained but there is time do do them once, so you have to keep pausing the dvd to get the required reps in."
3,Can't Quite Recommend,"This is a pretty good tutorial on the Blues. It contains well thought-out instruction on the pentatonic scales and their relationship to the Blues. However, it has a serious drawback. There are no backing tracks for songs on CD. Also, since it does not provide the tempo (in beats per minute), one has to spend valuable practice time building one's own backing tracks (unless you have your own band handy). These days, there are plenty of tutuorials that include backing tracks, as well. For this very reason, I cannot recommend it."
1,Dissapointed,Worked once and stuck in the open position. When dealing with a disabled person this adds to the stress. I am extreemly disappointed. No time to send it back until now.....
4,Great Product,"This is a great product to fill the gaps. My little boy loves Jimmy Neutron, but its not always on when he's able to watch television. So in the instances he wants to watch Neutron, I can through in this DVD and all is right in the universe."
3,plantbymail,"Plant arrived quickly. Was told it would have 3 plants in the 4 inch pot, but it only had 2 very small starts.I have had it for a few weeks now, and it has not changed at all. Very slow growing plant."
1,No good for saltwater,"This was recommended to me for a saltwater fish tank. Within a week it quit working and the ""claw"" would no longer close. I realize this might be outside the normal usage of this item but it does state it can be used in water. It failed even with rinsing in fresh water after use. If you have a saltwater fish tank and want to grab items on the bottom, don't use this."
5,perfect!!,I used this after i had surgery and it worked perfectly!! & then i gave it to my step father who had back surgery~!! he uses it everyday & he loves it! this thing picks up paper clips!! its incredible!!
1,Avoid this merchant!!,"Recieved something different from what i ordered and it was defective to boot. merchant expects me to pay to return it and has been generallyy unhelpful and unconcerned. Amazon is not screening these third party merchants very well. Beware. As to the reacher itself, I have used them in the past and they are sturdy and effective."
3,Review of Pikstick,"Overall, I like the Pikstick. My complaints are that it does not offer much traction when trying to pick up slick or smooth items. The length is nice. I would definitely recommend the Pikstick, but don't spend more than about $20-$25 for it."
5,"Good product, good quality","I bought this item for a person in a wheelchair, he finds it very usefull, good quality, not too heavy, he is very hapy whit the pikstik. I recommend the product."
1,Terrible! Definitely not worth the money!,This reacher is very difficult to use because the tips are angled so they do not match up and everything falls out of its grasp so you end up needing to stoop down to pick up the item. It's easier just to stoop down and pick up things in the first place. This item is a complete waste of money!
3,too hard to squeeze.,if something is note broken why fix it. Yes the new version is prettier but for the peoplethat use them you can use the old ones. The new ones can only be squeezed by body builders.
5,First trip to Hawaii,"We have just returned to the mainland from our first ever trip to Hawaii. We stayed at a wonderful B & B on Oahu, where we found the Frommer's guide to Honolulu, Waikiki and Oahu along with many other guide books, but we found it to be the best. This book was a fabulous guide, with all the maps and notes of places to go and things to see. We used it like a bible. It helped to make our trip very memorable."
5,Wonderful Christain love story,I really enjoyed this book by Robin J. Gunn. I couldn't put the book down. I anixously read on to see if God gave Meri her movie star. You'll love this book!
3,Doesn't work in portrait mode w/ 30d,"I bought this frame and the separate bracket for the 30D (no battery grip, just the 30D). So the good news is that it does provide an angle for the flash which prevents red eye and in general looks more natural. The bad news is that with anything but the small 50mm f1:1.8 lens, good luck keeping the camera straight in portrait mode.For what it is, it works fine. It seems way overpriced, but I am keeping it and will probably use it occasionally."
3,Pros and Cons,"Frame is decent. The pivoting arm is a little loose. Could be remedied by simply tightening the bolt on the hinge. The flash cord is a bust. I'm using it with a d90 and an sb-800 speed light. For some reason there is a little give which makes the flash fire intermittently which is very frustrating. Those of you who use the sb-800 know how precious the battery life is. Also when I shoot the flash sometimes fails to fire.The cord does mount a little tight, however, I think it is crazy using a hammer to remove it. There are alternative ways to do this.The bracket definitely improves the shots I have been taking. It gets the light where it needs to be and you can move the flash around very easily.All in all. I recommend the bracket, but spend a little extra in the cord."
3,a decent bracket,"The biggest problem with this bracket is its inflexibility. I prefer my flash mounted a little to the side of the lens, and this bracket lacks the capability to do that. It's too bad, because all they would have needed to do is allow the hot shoe to travel horizontally a little bit."
3,stroboframe quickflip 350 & off camera cord,"this flash bracket is Great for Horizontal shots, but Not for Vertical shots. On Vertical shots, it puts the flash too far off to the side of the lens & Not over it where it should be."
4,almost elated!,Its a very nice product and works well when I do my profession shoots. I am only disappointed that it didn't come with a little screw attachment so my flash would fit. I had to buy it for $15 at B and H. A little screw thats worth maybe a dollar. A little frustrating....
2,"Seen better, seen worse",My response to this film is lukewarm--I've seen better certainly but I've also seen worse. Do the lovers hook up for good?--Its one of those draw your own conclusion endings; nothing is clearly resolved which is probably why it did not resonate with me. I predict no Oscars for this one.
3,Too tall...,Won't fit in refrigerator with this stopper in place... it is too tall. Use different style of stopper now.
2,Low volume,"It's often difficult to hear the other person even when the volume of the handset is set to maximum. I don't think it's just that I'm hard of hearing, however, since I haven't had this problem with other phones (both cordless and corded)."
4,Take a Break from the Lower Forty-eight,"The Nathan Active police procedurals are a welcome read to those who enjoy their mysteries with a healthy dose of character development and cultural exploration. Alaskan State Police Trooper Nathan Active was given up at birth by his Inuit mother and raised by a white couple in Anchorage. His first posting is to the village where he was born. He returns as an outsider, more white than Inuit. Therein lies the interesting conflict. Eager to achieve and get promoted quickly out of this post, Active finds himself slowly and perhaps painfully putting down roots. The mysteries/crimes are secondary in my opinion to the fascinating character conflict. I look forward to reading more on this series."
2,Disappointed after one year of use,"I have owned the Remington MS-290 which looks almost identical to this model (MS2-200) for over one year. It shaves the cheeks well but does not perform as well on the neck because it does not account for the contours. It is more difficult to clean than other electric shavers because I cannot simply use water to rinse it. After 8 months, my screen developed a hole. A replacement screen is almost as much as the shaver itself. During the one year of ownership, I have used electric blades at times b/c I was frustrated with this shaver. On the plus side, the battery performs well and lasts around 10-15 shaves and the motor has done its job."
1,Garbage of a DVD,The video is horrible. I am a Whitney fan and it just sickens me to review such people talking about themselves. There were no interviews and/or new songs.A rate of big fat 0.
5,Great Album Year Round,This is such a great album that I listen to it year round! Connick's covers of traditional songs are wonderful but it is his own material that is the best. I pray on Chritsmas and Must have been Santa Claus (HO HO song) are unique and fresh. I am waiting for the next Christmas album Harry!
2,"Some good moments, but mostly disappointing","I bought this CD based upon how good ""What are you doing New Year's Eve?"" sounds. I was quite disappointed with at least half of the CD. The Wooden Soldiers song (not the title) is awful. Had he stuck to the smooth big band sound, it would be a much better album."
2,When My Heart Finds Christmas,"I purchase ""When My Heart Finds Christmas"" along with Whitney Houston ""One Wish"" Christmas album. I have to confess I love Whitney Houston's Christmas album. She sings some of the most beautiful Christmas songs on ""One Wish""...""Joy To The World"", ""Who Would Imagine A King"",""O Holy Night"" etc the list goes on...I'm very happy I purchase ""Whitney Houston's Christmas album ""One Wish"" along with ""When My Heart Finds Christmas"". It's definately one of my favorite holiday albums."
4,Good old-fashioned favourites,"When you think of Disney and Christmas, usually two cartoons come to mind immediately: The Small One, and Mickey's Christmas Carol. Having both on one DVD is a real treat for anyone who grew up with these classics, or indeed for anyone who has children.For my money, this was a pretty good DVD. It only received four stars because to be honest I had hoped it would imclude a few more of the classic christmas cartoon shorts, and Small One had a few snowy patches (maybe they should have remastered it a little first), but overall it was a great way to share the christmas spirit with my wife, who had never seen Small One and had been looking for Mickey's Christmas Carol for years! Good one Disney!"
5,classics,"they are being released in september so everyone can own a copy by the holiday season. these cartoons are timeless classics that can be enjoyed by both adults and children. considering they are not on television as much as the were years ago it's highly recommended to pic up both of disney's christmas classics, keep them coming."
4,Fun movie to watch with kiddos,"My 2 yr old son loves this ""Christmas Mickey"" movie, and I love that they are the stories I grew up with. It's so nice to share this classic with another generation."
3,Not so Crafty,"Not the greatest movie but can't pass up anything with Summer Glau. The movie has a couple of interesting twists towards the end, but never really gets off the ground. The effects are okay but nothing astounding. The movie trys to be ""The Craft"" and ""The Skulls"" at the same time but comes off like an after school movie. There is a lot of familiar faces from tv shows but no one gives a great performance. It's a good popcorn movie you could show anyone, but don't expect any scares."
3,Guilty fun,"How can one not like Summer Glau? And the movie was okay too. Can see it being the attempt at a TV series that didn't take off but that's okay. There are worse ways to waste time on a weekend - it certainly complimented the some pop-corn and lollies we wanted to eat. Sure the characters were cardboard cut-outs of actual people, and sure the hair and clothes were more important then the plot development, but that's okay too. It all stirred together in the pot like a bisque and came out alright in the end. Predictable and shallow but at least it was just enough fun to not matter."
4,Good,"It was a good book, but i felt that it was a little confusing at times. A good read, and would purchase again, but a little slow, and then a quick ending. I would have liked to see the ending charachters story a develop a little more."
4,Typical chick lit...,"This book was a very entertaining chick lit read, albeit a little predictable. The beginning and middle were good but the end seemed rushed. I would recommend as an average chick lit book but not as a favorite. :) Check out Whitney Gaskell or Janet Evanovich for those!"
1,"For the love of god, please let it snow Gloria in!","If I hear that song one more time, I think I will scream! It is not only the worst rendition of Let It Snow I have ever heard, I would say it is one of the worst songs ever recorded. If you waste your money on this CD, I hope Gloria buys a good tune-writer with it!"
4,Fabulously Different!,"We listened to this CD all through the Christmas Holidays and really enjoyed it! The Silver Bells rendition really turned our heads. Best version of the song we ever heard. Gloria' vocals have great range and her band does a terrific job on this CD. Not all the tracks were our favorites but this is a very listenable cd. A great Christmas CD for anyone' collection.~tom mercerLewes, Del"
3,Hippy music for babies,"Fun CD for parents and children alike (like the song, M-O-M-M-Y needs C-O-F-F-E-E). It gets kinda annoying after hearing it again and again, and the last few tracks are definitely just fillers, but it's still a nice change of pace from most children's CDs. Not as good as Putumayo Kids, better than Barney."
1,"really bad, boring","bad, boring, bad writing. After reading The Sexual life of Catherine M, I was just sleeping through this book!"
4,Muslim erotica,"Badra had a miserable life in Imchouk and although she ran to Tangiers for a better life, did she get it. She may have discovered her sexuality with Driss, but she certainly compromised herself for his selfishness. And in the end, as he was dying she was the one to care for him."
2,Do not expect enlightenment here.,"It would be hard to convince me that this book was written to provide any insights into the Muslim culture or into the soul of a woman. This book is clearly a work that is first and foremost pornographic. The plot plays out like that of an X-rated movie.Furthermore, it is clear that Badra, the main character, did not need to have an ""awakening."" Her pre-pubescent and adolescent experiences and thoughts reveal that she was never naive or reticent about the erotic side of life.Finally, the effectiveness of the translation from French is a bit suspect. There are stretches of ""sentences"" that are nothing but a jumble of disjoint words. It does not appear to be a conscious use of literary license.This is the story of all things titilating and sexual that ""happened"" in Badra's life. It is not a memoir of human breadth, depth, or substance."
2,knew it was coming...,"bad beats, weak rhymes. they can do so much better than this! if you're trying to get into either of these dudes pick up true & livin' from zion i, and making perfect sense from the grouch."
2,just dont get it,"how this fellow can be called a fahion photographer is beyond me. He is more documenting the LA scene in mid-90s & now i barely see his work in any magazine. & considering the explosion in fashion magazines, he should have no problem getting his work published but the proof is in the pudding.however, the structure ie the paper quality & huge size is still very appealing. just the technical aspects of photography is lacking.."
4,Exersaucer Mega Circus,Great product! Fairly easy to assemble and seems to be a good quality for the price. Baby loves it! I was disappointed that battery for musical toy cannot be replaced though.
5,Very entertaining,Bought this for my grandaughter when she was almost 6 months old. Took her a couple of days to really start to enjoy it. Toys are gr8 for entertaining & teething. Now that she is 8 months old & walking/ running- she doesn't like to get into it anymore but prefers to run around it and play with all the toys. Still gets alot of use. Probably my best short term investment. Did take grampa some time to put together but well worth it.
5,A Must for Baby,"Our little guy is 2 1/2 months old and is already enjoying his exersacuer mega! He has good head control and can bear weight on his legs, so he is comfortable being in it for up to 10 minutes. This will be a great toy for months to come!"
4,Good entertainer for the price,Lots of bright colored toys to play with. Nice soft teether toy that my daughter loves to chew on. easily folds up and fits in the back of our SUV to take to grandma's house. I gave it a 4 only because the assembly directions can be a little hard to follow at some points.
4,Great Book,I loved this book!! I feel that the information in this book would really be a lot of help to people interested in this subject and that also need this type of help.
5,Love this,I love this book and the information is very helpful. I do recommend it to anyone. I keep it in my special book pile.
2,Disappointed Overall,"While Draja Mickaharic is a highly touted author in the metaphysical arena, this text left much to be desired. This book was very general, touching seemingly upon descriptions of only the most mild cases of psychic attack, without depth on any page. It appears to be a text for someone who is just beginning to study psychic attack, its effects and possible remedies because the book gives little more than a very broad overview. As someone who is currently battling a psychic attack and am reading everything that I can possibly lay my hands on in regard to the subject, there was absolutely NOTHING that Mickaharic's text brought to me that was even remotely substantive or useful to my situation. If I could secure a refund for this book, I definitely would."
3,Hold on Tight,"I am a Deborah Smith fan, but this one didn't grab me and suck me in like all her others. I didn't finish it and passed it on to my sister, who is also a fan."
1,looks cute but no power.,I bought this thing to take care of spots. A cup of detergent water and a $20.00 wet vac has 5 times more power. The pump spits out solution at the rate of a gallon evrey 15 mins. The vac has the suction of a plug in auto vac (maybe). I used it a couple times and sent it to the auction house and lost about half what I paid. $85.00. The person who bought it still overpaid.
2,Works well - when it works.,"I've had two Bissell spot cleaning products including this one. Both were disappointing after several months of use. When they work, they are fine, but they are fussy when they turn on and off. This one will sometimes deign to move the brushes, and sometimes they will not. Note that I purchased a refurbished unit.Note that the 'recommended' amount of cleaner seems too much and leaves the carpets foamy. The excess cleaner actually attracts dirt. We had better luck when we reduced the cleaner."
2,not impressed,"I had high hopes for this little machine. We recently moved from a house with a yard to an apartment and our dog has had trouble with the transition. She has been peeing on one area of the brand new carpet when we're not around. I tried this machine and the urine smell is still there. The carpet is brown so the spot is not noticeable, but the smell is still there after treating with several different pet urine odor remover solutions. After this machine failed me I hired professionals to deep clean and treat the area and the odor is still there, faint, but still there. I'm at the end of my rope. I wish I hadn't wasted the $129 on this machine."
1,Died after a year. Flooded the floor.,"I really liked this in the beginning. Having cats, I had to deal with the occasional cat vomit or hairballs. This unit would sometimes leave a big ""dot"" where it cleaned. Although I could fix that with the hand tool. After a year, it just died and flooded all over a wood floor. Verdict: nice at first, not sturdy for long term."
3,OK but not all that,"I usually have my carpet professionally cleaned about once a year and was hoping to use this for the in-between times. I have a cat who now and then sneaks a little dog food and then of course vomits. This vomit turns out red-based because of the food. With this product being called spot bot for pets I was hoping it would do better. It only barely lightens the red-based stains to a pink color, certainly not removing it. It does seem to work so far on other stains that aren't so reddish. I used it three times on one of the bad spots, but still no luck. Very easy to use right out of the box, though, everything you need comes with it. It could be expensive to use also, it only cleans a very small area and it uses quite a bit of chemical each time. If I had used this before purchasing, I'm not sure I would have gone ahead and bought it."
5,Absolutely Awesome!!,"I hadn't heard of the Spot Bot prior to receiving one as a gift. I have a dog and 2 cats and there is always something to clean up. This machine is great!! Lightweight and easy to transport. Whether it's a setin stain or a quick clean up it does both very well. You must get the Oxy Gen and Pet Stain/Odor remover that are recommended, they are expensive but well worth it. Absolutely the best I've ever used, can't live without it!"
5,I tell this thing I love it.,"Really, I do. It just works. Yeah it gets funky and stinky, but consider what it's picking up. It still does it's job, which keeps me from having to do it which is the point. I don't buy the cleaner that you're supposed to put in the tank - I just spray the mess with Woolite Pet Oxygen Stain & Odor Remover (I got it at Target - works PERFECT) and leave it for a few minutes, fill this with hot water and let it go on surface stain and it has never disappointed me. Sure it leaves circles - its cleaning in a circular motion. They dry and go away. Yeah it leaves the floor damp. It cleans with a decent amount of water - it dries. I have 2 cats and when they barf or when the one misses the cat box, this thing cleans poop stains off the carpet like a pro. It even cleans old stains. I haven't used the hand thing too much so I won't comment on that. But to just sit it on a stain and push GO and walk away - I love it and recommend it and don't know what I'd do without it."
2,Not for me,"Placing the lift in any chair we have brought the seat height to an uncomfortable height,It's wll made, but not suitable for us.Uplift Seat Assist 80-230 lb Chair Seat Lift - Black"
5,My new fave,"I listen to mediative music CDs all night long to help me sleep. When I'm having more trouble sleeping than usual, this is the one I go to. I just relax very quickly. Bodhipaksa's accent and voice are comforting and the timing of his words are perfection. (And I don't often write reviews of products.)"
2,Guided Meditations for Stress Reduction,"The voice on the CD is not at all soothing. I expected a soothing far eastern accent and got a harsh, Scottish accent. I recommend buying the CDs narrated by Shakti Gawain herself."
3,Good book if you're into scriptures.,"My only problem (and this is a PERSONAL problem, let me be clear) is that there are too many comparisons with the bible, which to me is just, basically, a fictional anthology. There were some good points brought up in the book, along with some good quotes."
4,Quality glue gun,Good glue gun for the money. I wanted a full size glue gun that would heat up quickly and not drip glue all over the place. I mostly use this gun for cementing wood together and it does a great job at it. The gun heats up quickly too. The only reason I am giving this glue gun 4 stars is that it does tend to drip small amounts of glue while sitting in the stand after I've applied some glue to my wood projects. I'm still pleased with it and can live with the glue dripping; definitely not going to return it.
1,The people who conned us out of our house probably read this,"This book will go into the circular file, if you know what I mean. It is difficult for me to understand why there are so many people like this who only see others as dollar signs and 'pets' (as they call renters) they can take advantage of. I will NOT be using their con strategies as a landlord. I hate the idea about leading someone to believe your office is in a building but you not even having one. We unfortunately were duped like this except the guy had a post office box that he led us to believe was his 'office suite.' Whatever. Just don't buy this book, instead look for a book that is morally and ethically teaching you how to provide a good service or product in this world and your business will then flourish!"
1,Leaves you feeling dirty,"This is the worst book on rental units I have ever read. These people while not crooks, are definitely on the shady side. One of the tacticts that they encourage is lying. While I was reading through this book, I couldn't figure out why tenants would want to rent from these people."
1,Simon Legree Lives!,"I would never rent from these people, and if I instituted their policies, my properties would remain vacant. If your only interest is making as much money as possible while taking as little responsibility as possible for maintaining your property and dictating all behaviors of every teneat, by all means buy this book. If you are content to make a decent living and provide safe, desireable housing for normal people there are a lot of other books available that address what you need to know. Anyone who insists that the whole family come for the interview and then judges their suitability based on how well behaved young children are during an 1 1/2 to 2 hour interview is not someone whose advice I recommend. How many three year olds do you know who are going to remain ""well behaved"" during a two hour interview that consists of adults reviewing an 11 page (legal size) lease unless they are asleep????"
5,A great mother-daughter read aloud!,"This is a wonderful book! It is so well written and inspiring. I read this book after reading Ester Ried, Asleep and Awake out loud to my [...] year old daughter. Both books are wonderfully thought-provoking and spiritually challenging. My daughter had a little trouble ""getting into"" this second book at first but, I think mostly because Ester Ried herself was not in this book and there were specific characters from the first book that my daughter was hoping would be continued in this one. But once she caught the flow of Ester Ried Yet Speaking she would beg me to read more each night. I would highly recommend this as a mother-daughter read aloud...it affords so many opportunities for valuable discussion. I would have enjoyed just reading the book myself but the experience was greatly enriched by sharing it with my daughter."
5,bought two copies of this,"i bought two copies of this, for two seven year olds: the first one, to see what it looked like, and the second when it was clear that this was a good book. the kids will need some grown-up participation, to read the instructions and to do careful folding. but it's a great concept and i think they'll enjoy it. it's also suitably instructional about aerodynamics and so on: doesn't talk down to kids, but isn't overly complicated."
4,"Cool paper, and the airplanes really fly!","The paper for this book is VERY cool, really awesome designs and easy to fold. The instructions for the planes are easy to follow (with advice for what to do it you fold wrong, and how to throw each particular plane - and they're all rated as to what SORT of plane they are and how hard they are to make), and did I say the planes really fly?The ONLY two things I have wrong with this book are the paper! First, there's just not enough of it. 40 sheets ought to be enough, but you know it's not. Secondly, and more seriously, the folder the paper goes in is a little too tight, and it's either spend 10 minutes struggling to put it back in OR risk bending or tearing some of the precious plane paper. And that sucks. Aw, there's an easy solution - get your own folder for paper and put it in there."
5,Easy instuctions,"I bought this book for my 6 year old after he saw it at a friends house. It's kind of expensive, but it is a very high quality book. My son can't read but followed the instruction with some help from me. He has been making his own paper airplanes for a while. The different paper is fun and good quality. Great book!"
4,Simple & Interesting,"The illustrations are clear and simple. And the airplane paper is included, which is a big plus.Surprising to me, all the paper planes I made with my daughter fly better indoor than outside. We are somewhat disappointed, for the plans keep hitting the walls and when we took them outside, eight out of ten times they didn't do so well. Our house is not too small and with second stories. It might be difficult for kids to play them in smaller houses or inside of an apartment."
3,Good book,Mr. Craig is very knowledgeable and supports his arguments very well. His wording is very technical and hard to read at times.
2,Not impressed,There were several things I didn't like about the book:a) It didn't ring true--it felt like an adult trying to write like a 13 year oldb) All the references to the 1980s (music politics etc..) were forced. I get it. It takes place in the 1980sc) It was dull
3,Great Album,"Another great album from my favorite singer. The beautiful title track (which Celine dedicated to her husband and love of her life, Rene) really brings the whole album together. The best ballads on the album include Celine's soaring rendition of ""The Power of Love,"" heartwrenching ""Think Twice,"" Celine's cover of the classic ""When I Fall In Love,"" (on which she duets with Clive Griffin) ""Only One Road,"" and ""Love Doesn't Ask Why."" The album also has several dance tracks including ""Misled,"" the inspirational ""Refuse To Dance,"" and ""Everybody's Talkin' My Baby Down."""
5,Good CD,I think some of the songs are really good.I did not like Colour of My Love as much as Power of Love.
5,Great as always,"I think this CD is perfect.There is nothing I can say,except that this Celine Dion is the best singer alive.I can't stay alive for a day with out listening to her music.(Well,I can live, ofcourse,but really...)"
5,Big Hits,"This album is brilliant. About five of the songs were released as singles in the UK when the album first came out. All of them were big hits, which is why I don't understand why some people have negative things to say about Celine. They're not fans, they're jealous. Just go out (or order on-line) The Colour Of My Love, it's worth the money."
2,Step in the wrong direction,"I love Celine Dion's music. Even though Mariah Carey is my all-time favorite I still love Celine's incredible voice. However she does have her misses... like this album. I am a huge fan of her Self-titled, ""Falling Into You"" and ""Let's Talk About Love"" albums. Unfortuantely I didn't enjoy this. It didn't seem like it was from the heart. it seemed like it was made for mass appeal like her debut album. The only songs I really liked was ""The Power of Love""--one of her best singles. I'm being VERY generous for giving this 2 stars. The only reason I'm doing it is because of the ""Power of Love."" I'd reccomend ""Celine Dion"", ""Falling Into You"" or ""Let's Talk About Love"" over this anyday. D-"
4,Good steamer for the money.,"I bought this steamer specifically for cleaning my white tile grout on floors with heavy traffic, including a husband with muddy boots and dogs with muddy feet. It works really quite well. The tank will hold 48 oz. of water which produces steam for nearly an hour with the lock button on to steam continuously. It's not a fast process, but the steam does blast the dirt out of the grout lines, and I follow behind with a mop as I go, rinsing it frequently. I had great results by putting some grout cleaner in a spray bottle, and spraying the grout lines ahead of where I was steaming to pretreat. It really seemed to loosen the dirt and it blew right out with the steam. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm also hoping it will work on soap scum and lime scale in the showers from our hard water."
1,Classic Songs Given The Neil Diamond Treatment,"This is a great collection of songs sung the Neil Diamond way.... forced, over-emotional. This wouls have been a lot better if Neil just relaxed and let these fine songs stand on their own. This is a collection of fun songs that is not all that much fun to listen to."
3,"Argumentative, but not very convincing","The problem with many books on Jesus is the Author starts with a thesis, then goes on to pick from the New Testamente the elements that support his thesis, ignoring all else. This book is no exception: It gives some good points, but fails to answer his own question (also mine): WHY paul of Tarsus should have fabricated such a story about a Jewish patriot,a sort of Jewish Che Guevara, transmogrifying him in a Soteriological figure? Moreover, I doubt the name Jesus was ever used as a title, as Unterbrink claims. Why discounting the Jesus of the Gospels as an individual in His own right just because legends were told about Him...as were told about Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne? Geza Vermss and J. P. sanders give, in my opinion, a more convincing view of the real Jesus."
1,Ouch,"This book just hurt me to read. I have never scanned over a book that I had actually started to read, but this earned whole sections of scan. McEwan has a tiresome ability to pour out of his protagonist tomes of unfulfilling descriptions that are PAINFUL to read through. Additionally, I doubt the ability of a person, even a fictional character, to recall with dulling detail memories of events. Perowne could regurgitate an entire page of drivel in the instance of opening a door or turning his car down a street. I don't doubt neurosurgeons are smart, but no one can ruminate such obtuse and lengthy inner-discourses in lightning quick instances. McEwan seemed more intent on living up to his prior accolades by performing a thought-exercise in writing, without ever telling a meaningful story."
3,Typical Ian McEwan book,"This book was nothing special. It was a quick and easy read. I read Atonement in 2003 and liked it very much. Since then, I have read many other Ian McEwan books and, expecting so much more, have been let down everytime. None have lived up to my expectations of the writer.I have learned his writing style and see it in all of his books now. The book is very normal with not much happening in the first 2/3. The real action and interesting parts of the book are in the last 1/3.In the future, I will keep readng his books. I hope to really like another one."
3,A Shallow Hero and a Shallow Book,"I grant that this novel is powerfully written; that it is often engrossing; that the thoughts imputed to its hero are often intelligent. But it must also be said immediately that the ruminations of the hero are as often -- more often, in fact -- tedious and pretentious rather than engrossing. The hero and his virtues, as they are expounded by the author, are deeply conventional and tiresome in ways that the author could not have intended. In the end, what we get is exactly the opposite of what is promised. The author presents this man as interesting and challenging, but -- at least to this reader -- he comes through as depressingly conventional and very, very shallow. And shallow, I am afraid, is the word for the book too."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This was the most boring book I have read in a long time. I would like to read something else by the author as I can see the writing is well done, it is just that the story was a complete bore. Had not the description on the jacket inset not alluded to a final crisis, it probably wouldn't have been completed so I trudged through the book thinking perhaps the crisis would salvage the time spent but alas it did not.I found Henry totally absorbed with his private parts at every turn and self-absorbed in between. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
3,Amazing writing of an unconvincing story,"If you are familiar with McEwan, you probably would agree that he is one of the finest authors around today. He may spend 2 pages describing one second of the protagonist's life such as an instant when he drives through an intersection or a point in a raquetball game. This may sound boring but the words flow ""like butter"" so grab yourself a Scotch and enjoy the prose. He is really talented.Now for the bad part... McEwan story is just too unbelievable and does not go with his realistic style of writing. He may be trying too hard to entertain us. In this book, as in Atonement, he has researched his topic well (the protagonist is a neurosurgeon), but he tries too hard to show off his knowledge. Is he trying to impress the reader? I am impressed by his writing but not by his plot or his knowledge of neurosurgery. I will continue reading McEwan. He certainly has the talent to write an amazing book, but will he ever really come through for us?"
3,Disapppointing,"I thoroughly enjoyed 'Atonement' and was hoping for a similar experience with this book, but alas. I could not bring myself to like Henry Perowne, he was too cold and detached. I got the feeling that this novel was just a re-hash of 'Mrs. Dalloway' with some violence, sex and nudity thrown in just to make it more contemporary."
1,Boooorrrrrriiiiinnnnnggggggg,"Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information. Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished."
4,Outstanding!,"A wonderful read. Imagine within a 24 hour period, all of the negative things that can occur in your life. An engaging novel that you'll enjoy. See all of my recommendations by clicking on ""See all my reviews."""
2,Not worth the price.,"I found this book very difficult to get into. I kept on reading it expecting to be sucked in but I never was. I was also not a fan of the way that the author described every aspect of the story in such painstaking and unnecessary details. Overall I'd say if you can buy it used for a few dollars then give it a shot, but don't pay the full retail price."
2,Not quite as bad as Amsterdam,"To start, I have read some of McEwan's novels and quite enjoyed them.Secondly, as in the review title, it doesn't quite reach the pits of Amsterdam (a poorly constructed sliver of a a book with insufficient characterization and not nearly enough about it to achieve anything near the suspension of disbelief necessary to carry the improbable plot line).This book falls into the category of those McEwan books where he's aimed for something like high art and fallen somewhat flat - a stream of consciousness narrative that seems intended to show everyone what a clever fellow he is.Parts are OK, and he is quite a clever fellow.Not so enjoyable, then, and a sudden and again hard to swallow denouement which doesn't sit well with the rest of the intellectualizing."
2,Painful,"After starting and stopping my ""Read Saturday"" project over the past 5 months, I finally finished this book. Having read ""Atonement,"" I know McEwan has an amazing ability to craft words, prose, emotions... but it was lost on this book. Instead, the author delves into an overly-detailed, verbose exploration of the day. (I don't care how beautifully you can write, 20 pages on one trivial squash match is just too much.) While the underlying premise and message of the book are powerful, it's just too pretentious in its over-detail."
3,"Surprisingly disappointing after ""Atonement""","While stylistically the writing continues to be intricate and lovely, ""Saturday"" is far too plodding a character study to stand up to McEwan's best work. Aggregated together, the various episodes of this one day do not create a gripping or meaningful point of view; and while portions are brilliant, much of the novel is banal."
3,I dislike Henry Perowne,"I guess what I don't like about Henry Perowne is his perfect goodness. Wonderful surgeon: helping people, hard worker, understanding of human faults, loving and faithful husband, concerned and generous father of talented children, kind to his mother, all that. We could canonize Henry, I guess, except for the fatal flaw, so proud of his 500 series Benz. Totally out of character.One of the professional reviewers said that this book seemed autobiographical. If so, lucky Ian. I have liked some of his earlier books, ""Atonement"", of course, and ""The Innocent"". ""Satuday was readable, but I was disappointed in it."
2,let down,"If you like pretentious, ponderous novels with just enough interesting developments between long long long stretches of nothingness to keep you slogging through to find out why oh why was this a top ten book, you'll like this. Not for me."
4,"Excellent Writing. Slow moving, not what i expected","Yeah Yeah Yeah. Don't judge a book by it's cover. I know nothing of Ian McEwan, other than Atonement got astonishing reviews. I thought this looked like an adventerous ""24 Hour"" kinda book with the x-ray clock on the cover. While the program material was not very interesting to me, I was *completely* blown away by McEwan's prose and attention to detail. He must have gotten out of trouble easily when he was a kid with his ability to invent miniscule details that carve out a scene. This talent alone is worth this read. I would read other books by this guy and recommend this particular novel to people who I think would enjoy a fabulous writer for writing's sake."
4,wellworth the time,"At last a novel that resonates with tthe confusion in the world we live in today. Having written several unfavorable reviews, I can finally rave about this one. Ian McEwan is one of the better novelists writing today, and if I could, I would give this a four-plus rating. I am reserving five stars for a novel I would reread. There are many aspects to this novel that I found intriguing, especially the ability to get inside Henry Perowne's head and feel his anger and frustration with life. McEwan is a masterful author and this book deserves a rave review."
2,PASS ON DINNER IF SURGERY IS IN THE OFFERING,"It is obviously impossible for Ian McEwan to duplicate ATONEMENT. This attempt feels so contrived that it it is hard to believe that the same author wrote both books.I didn't care about the characters, and the protagonist lost it for me completely when he left his home and victimized family to perform surgery on the man who attempted to harm him. What a crock !If Ian were a first-time novelist, this would never be in print."
1,Torture!,"I really tried to like this book. I really wanted to like it. I was the one who recommended it for book club. Everybody HATED it! The book is 90% stream of conscious. Following the narrator's thoughts from one tangent to another just does not make for entertaining - or enlightened! - reading. When there was action, it was very far fetched. Operating on the man who burgled your house, held a gun to your wife and molested your daughter?? Please. It was just too much. I have read a lot of books, but I would not recommend this one to anyone."
1,Zzzzzzzzz for Saturday,"I fail to understand all the love for this book. It is boring and so microscopically, minutely paced. Immediately, I already didn't care for the characters or the story. By page 10, I was hoping that he would find out he was watching the happenings below because he was dead and was hovering above.I got so irritated trying to read this detail-dripping drog. After page 50 with nothing happening, I skipped ahead to page 90 and still it was the same dribble, with nothing happening. Never saw or read Atonement. I think I know why. This sucker goes back to the library tonight on my way home.I only gave this one star because I couldn't give it zero stars.The praises on the back of the book are too hilarious: ""Best story teller of our time!"" I don't think so."
3,a little slow but interesting,"When you read that this novel takes place in one day, don't expect anything like a season of the TV show 24. Just the opposite, here. Very little happens over the first 2/3 of the book. Mostly it's flashbacks. It's wordy, almost overwritten at times, but there are great images, too. The last 100 pages, things pick up, and I felt good about the book at the end. Half the time, I liked this, half the time, I got a bit restless."
3,Some of the classic JAMS,Two tracks here that can't be missed: 'What is Love' by Haddaway and 'Understand This Groove' from the Sound Factory. They simply make this album worthwhile.
5,Kutless Does it Again!!!,"This is an Amazing Album, Even the Acoustic songs. I pre-ordered this album on there site and got it today. The dvd alone is Awesome. You get all 7 videos they made. Looking forward to future Albums from Kutless."
4,Perhaps their best music album,I was a Kutless fan few years ago. This is perhaps their best music album along with TKTYA.Fui admirador de Kutless hace algunos años. Este es probablemente el mejor album de ellos junto con TKTYA.
5,Redeemed,"I was one of the vocal minority thoroughly disappointed by Kutless's previous album, the praise & worship one. ""Hearts of the Innocent"" redeems them, though. With this one, they return to the driving, hard-rock edge that made them so great. The lyrics are, of course, inspirational, and the album is filled with uplifting messages of hope (""Smile"") and unabashed faith in God (""Shut Me Out""). But it's the edgy guitars and great beat that make this album rock (okay, ""Promise of a Lifetime"" is a little slow, but still very good). An excellent album for Kutless fans, and a great example of some of the best in rock music today."
3,Potentially good product.,"The item came with a lot of bumps and bruises - dents and what not. It is a good product, but would've been better had the defects not been on there."
4,Exponential curve?,"Radical Evolution discusses how the rate of technological innovation has consistently accelerated over time, and the implications for what the world might look like in ten, twenty, fifty years because of this.Garreau focuses on 3 main scenarios for how it all might turn out, and he dubs these Heaven, Hell, and Prevail, which you can think of as optimistic, pessimistic, and realistic, respectively.Interspersed in this presentation are many interesting tidbits and information about what is currently being worked on by agencies such as DARPA. My overall impression was that the book was of the variety of Blink and Faster, but with more meat.The book content is actually only 273 pages long, due to a large index and collection of suggested readings, both very comprehensive."
4,nice.,"good book, nicely set out chronically by date on various crime photography. on the right page there is the photo, left- info; which is always a nice format. good value for money as well, as is thick and not too small not to see the photos clearly yet easy to carry around. in conclusion- good. nice."
5,Good little coffee maker,"I received this for Christmas last year and it's still going strong. I'm a moderate user, usually 12 cups or so per week. It's not completely silent, but it's not loud enough to wake people in the early morning. I find that it's easy to operate and keep clean. Yes, the K-cups can be pricey, but you can find good deals on them online and grocery stores now carry them so they're easier to get (plus you can get teas and juices as well!) The only thing I would change would be the amount of water it holds. I wish that could be bigger. I find myself constantly filling it up."
4,Decent cuppa,"Bought the Elite to put in my office as the office coffee is horrid (some coffee syrup that gets delivered in a plastic bag!) The first Keurig unit I bought, however, apparently has a ""calibration"" problem (as described by Keurig's customer support) and had to be replaced. (Every two or three cups all the lights would flash and I'd have to unplug/replug to get it working again.) When I called they took me through a quick diagnostic and concluded replacement was needed and immediately shipped another, don't have the ship the first one back (but they do need the filter cup, so you don't get to keep two!)... Which just arrived. Assume this is an unusual thing for them, and I'm happy with the service. Happy with their coffee store as well: Ordered my ""buy two, get two"" which was a very good deal and included the Starbucks coffee I like."
5,Love It!,"Coffee tastes like restaurant brewed! Ordered it on Sunday, received it on Wednesday. Rare, living in Hawaii. Super service Amazon!"
5,Love it!,My husband and I are not coffee snobs but pretty close to it. We love this machine! We drink coffee all day long and it's so nice to be able to brew a fresh cup every time. I also love the variety we can drink without having to make a whole pot and I can switch to decaf in the afternoon no problem. I do however wish the k-cups weren't so expensive but we did order the pod holster to lower the expense.
2,not hot enough,"the coffee appears to be hot enough when it brews but as soon as you add cream it cools it down and if you like a lot of cream it is barely luke warm after adding it, like you left it sitting for a while before drinking. It's not enjoyable at all."
3,Very Frustrated,"I bought this at Boscov's over Thanksgiving for just $88.00 - great price, but I am sooooooooo frustrated with it!We all have our favorite coffee brands and my husband's, son's and my fave brand is the Dunkin Donuts regular. But, alas, no pods by Dunkin Donuts. I cannot find any brand that we care for in the Keurig pods. I also bought My K Cup -- worthless. Weak coffe and spurts all over the place. THEN I bought the EZ cup and the paper filters --- worked better but still ended up with a weak lousy cup of coffee. For tea --- the Cafe Express Chai Latte is yummy and Cocoa - also their Dark Chocolate Cocoa -- the brewer works great. But it is too expensive to have for just those drinks! So, it is going back to Boscov's as well as the My K Cup."
2,Good product but ours died with no warning.,"We purchased our Keurig about 3 months ago, it's worked fine up until a week ago when it simply wouldn't turn on. We tried other outlets, nothing, the power button won't light up when pushed. It's totally dead. We called customer service only to be on hold forever and then finally someone back on the line and said that they'd get back to us in 1 to 2 business days, and that was 3 days ago and we haven't heard from them. For the price of these machines, the quality could be a lot better. It's a great concept, but the Kcups are expensive, if you use 2-3 a day that's 45 dollars or more a month for kcups, that's not cheap at all. We do have the My Kcup but that had to be rigged to work otherwise water spills all over the place when you try to use it. They need better customer service. I'm sure we aren't the first to have one die like this. I'd rather just make coffee in a regular coffee maker for a fraction of the cost of this product and the kcups."
1,Expensive & Wasteful,"We were given one as a Christmas present. We like strong coffee, and none of the cups that came with the present will make a strong cup. I'm noticing that these things are in the $120 range, which is sad to see. A $20 coffee maker with a pound of Starbuck's coffee from Target will make you a better cup.Just don't give in to this ridiculous trend. I rate it a 1 star not because it fails to operate but because it is expensive on the front end and to operate, is bad for the environment, and does not make a satisfactory cup of coffee."
2,"Noisy, unreliable","I have had my Keurig B40 for almost two and a half years: purchased Nov 2009. I use it daily and sometimes twice daily in the winter. After the first year the pump became very noisy. My father had one just like mine and it was very noisy too. This morning (Feb 2012) mine failed to work. I emptied the tank, shook it a bit, and sprayed a jet of water into the empty tank. To my surprise it started working again, but I don't anticipate that it will last much longer. I believe that a small appliance which costs $100 should last five years or more.Needless to say, I have started looking for a replacement -- from a different manufacturer. I must say I am also concerned about drinking hot coffee that has been piped through a cheap plastic cup."
1,Taste like Plastic,Tried 3 different K-cups from the sampler pack that came with the unit and they all tasted bad with a funny smell. Brewed just a cup of hot water with the unit and tasted it. YUCK!!! plastic!!!. Ran white vinegar through unit and let sit for 4 hours but it still tasted like plastic. Called Keruig and they if you've tried the white vinegar trick and it still taste like plastic you have to send it back.So I sent the B40 back.We have a B60 at the office and my father also has one and they both work fine so I ordered one of those. I received the B60 last night. Tested it with just water. YUCK!!!! Plastic again. Running vinegar cycle through unit today while I'm at work to see if that fixes it.Very disappointing.
4,Great coffee maker,Makes a great cup of coffee at the proper temperature in a very short time. It is a pleasure to use.
5,Keurig B-40,The Keurig B-40 is one terrific machine. Water comes out quickly and it's hot. The K-Cups are also terrific. Excellent taste.
1,lasted 1 year and 3 days,"Do you want to have a sad feeling that after spending almost a hundred dollars on a coffee maker? We ended up sitting with a worthless machine only a few days after the warranty expired. Symptoms of machine death are: started being very noisy, then even noisier like a jet! while giving off partial 2 to 3 oz brews, then 1 oz brews, then finally only spit. This happened all on its last day. The water tank did need to be cleaned repeatedly as it seems to want to grow black mold, which was odd as we use only filtered water. Otherwise, for a year we loved this machine. It was just too short lived for the money to ever repurchase this product line again. To save the environment we were using the pod accessory. The k cups are a land fill disaster.All that plastic!"
4,christmass,Keurig B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing Systemi bought this for my wife for x-mass so i dont know how well it works. with the way she is ranting about how bad she wants one i must be great. ty -Mark A. Garibay
1,Poor return policy,I needed to return this item. I did promptly and know it got to its destination since I had paid the post office for a Track and Confirm. I have received NO acknowledgment and NO message that I have received my credit. This item was over $100! Because of this I am tempted not to patronize Amazon any more. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS MATTER ASAP. Item in question is: Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System.
3,instantly delicious,"I recently purchased the Keurig for my office. Its quick, safe, clean and the K-cups are available in many flavors. My officemates and I love it!"
4,Best bang for your buck.,"I have had this machine now for 4yrs and I love it. I can never go back to a mr coffee. Yes it is louder then the other models, but not enough to make me pay the diffrence. This model is perfect it has the large cup or small cup setting. The other models have a med cup setting (still not worth the extra $ for the other more expensive models). It a great machine and I have not had any problems with it."
4,Coffee for One,I recently became a single woman. I got tired of cleaning a coffee pot everyday after finishing my 1 or 2 cups. The Keurig coffee maker is the perfect solution. It is takes essentially no cleanup and makes a cup of delicious coffee quickly.
2,"Cool machine, weak coffee",The idea and design for this machine are very good. The ease of use and lack of mess are very good. The cup of coffee that it brews is not so good. The vast selection of coffees is enticing but no matter what type I used the product was 8oz. of brown water. Granted I like stronger coffee but for some reason this machine seems to make VERY weak coffee. I am going to contact the manufacturer to see if the unit is defective.........
2,not hot coffee,"on two elite brewers, used thermometer, water immediately measured in cup , two different brewers, only 160 degrees,minimum amount of milk made it lukewarm,had to warm it up in pot, returned both, not hot coffee!"
3,"Easy, convenient single service coffee maker","Love this coffee maker with one exception: when you use a larger size setting, the coffee is too weak. They only have one size k-cup."
5,keurig drink maker,Most people buy the Keurig drink maker for coffee. I am not a coffee drinker. This machine does a great job on tea - gone to daily with breakfast because this is so easy. Wish they had more selections (Irish Breakfast tea etc.) The cocoa is also very good. It is hard to find anything but the coffee anywhere but on line and the tea and cocoa are often sold out locally.
5,I love it.,Brewing system is perfect when you want some coffee but don't want to make a whole pot. Plenty of flavors readily available at multiple stores. DSollar General is most reasonable priced!
5,so easy,"just ordered this and i am very pleased. i am the only coffee drinker in the house and this makes the perfect one cup of coffee. i used to grind my own beans, messy filters etc. this simplifies the whole process. just make sure to test the sample pack coffees. i like mine really strong, so timothy bold midnight or expresso is perfect for my tastes. some others are much weaker."
2,Consider the drawback,"The one thing that I can't stand about this system is it requires you to add more water when the reservoir still has enough water for a cup or two of coffee, and it won't let you brew a cup until you add more. The reservoir is 25% full and it forces me to add more water. You wouldn't like it if your car shut down and wouldn't drive because the gas tank was at 25%, and you were forced to add more gas to the car that already had enough to get the job done. You have water sitting in the reservoir that can't be used, and if it sits there long enough, things will grow in it. If that's the kind of thing that will drive you crazy, don't buy this. The coffee also loses its taste because hot water is pouring through thin plastic coffee cups... the plastic ruins the flavor. Otherwise, the system is conveinient and quick."
2,Coffee too weak,"I received this item as a gift, and where I love my friend who gave it to me, I am not fond of this machine. The only problem with it is the watery, weak coffee it brews. I have tried everything from changing coffee brands to varying fill levels of the K-cups and nothing works. Every single cup is watery and weak. If you are a seasoned coffee drinker who enjoys a decent strength of coffee, don't buy this machine."
4,WOUD BE 5 STARS IF HOTTER OUTPUT,"Bought mine yesterday at Bed Bath Beyond ($119.99 less a 20% coupon and a no hassle guarantee to bring it back frm the salesperson). Also bought the My K-cup which I have not used yet. I have used it twice with the large cup setting with 2 of the coffees included in the box. Very easy to set up. Not loud, does not vibrate (as some others have posted). One of the reasons I bought this brand was after reading the Starbuck's is launching K-cups this August and the fact that Tassimmo does not offer the ""use your own filter"" option at this time.For $0.50-$0.65 cents per cup, I figure this will pay for itself in a short time compared to going to Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks for my lattes. Also, I throw so much coffee away when I use my Cuisinart drip brew or French Press - there is no cofee wasted here.i really wanted to give this 5 stars, but the only reason I did not is because it could be a tad hotter. If you like your coffee REAL HOT then you may be disappointed."
1,Very upset,"Got the first one. It stopped working. We Sent it back to amazon and they sent a new one. This one acted the same as the last one. It worked for a while and then stopped. I was so angry I put it on the shelf, then decided the trash was the best place for it. With a tea drinker in the family this was thought to be ideal. But beware some of these are lemons"
2,not as good as the mini in my opinion,"I bought this model and found it quite disappointing after my experience with the mini version--if you like to brew with the freshest water, prefer greater control over cup sizes, and want a model that doesn't take up a ridiculous amount of room, go with the mini. With the B40, the reservoir system just means you almost always have water standing in the unit. It only has two cup sizes, both of which are kind of odd for modern mugs (& which don't seem optimized for the lighter roasts). While it says in the specs that the size is 12.8 x 15.1 x 15.2 inches, you need at least another four inches of vertical clearance to get the thing open! Also, since it has a pump, it vibrates and is noisier. I wholeheartedly endorse the mini, but the only thing the B40 Elite has going for it is you can fit a travel mug under it.It works, it makes coffee, so I can't say it is horrible...just very disappointing."
1,"Good coffee, poor durability",I love the coffee that my B40 brewed. However after 2.5 years I finally have to toss it. It recently developed a horrible plastic taste. Each time I de-scale it it lasts only a couple of days before it returns. Mine lasted a long time compared to my brother and parents. Theirs lasted 12 & 18 months. It's a shame that they aren't built to last.
3,Stopped Working After 2 Years,"I really liked this coffee maker. But it stopped powering on after 2 years of occasional use. I feel like this is supposed to be a higher end coffee maker and I feel like I should've gotten more life out of it. I called to see if there was anything Keurig could do, but they said since it's out of warranty all they could do was offer me one at half price. For $60 I'm not sure I would want to waste my money again. I think I'll be looking for another brand. But for the 2 years it worked we loved it!"
2,"Coffee Great, but Machine un-Reliable","I did not purchase the B40 from Amazon; I got it as a Christmas present. However I do buy a lot from Amazon, & feel this is the best place add my review.The coffee is great! I love the convenience of the k-cups, and the price per cup isn't bad (around 0.50 cents a cup average - sometimes you can get deals that get you in the 40 cents a cup range). I also enjoy the tea items, such as the half lemonade, half tea Celestial Seasonings selection. It's just a fun thing to have.The reason for my 2 star review is I had to return the machine because it no longer works after 2 months of usage. I thought maybe I just got a lemon, but a friend is also returning her B40 for the same reason. This makes me wonder if there are some unreliable parts in this machine.If this were just a $20 coffee maker, I wouldn't expect much. But for over $100, my expectations are much higher. I'm going to go back to my old coffee maker, which has served me well for a number of years. Too bad."
4,fresh coffee,A fresh cup any time of day. Love my new coffee maker. You can also change flavors on the second cup.
5,Wonderful,I love my Keurig. My husband and I only drink about 1 cup a day and this is just perfect and so easy.
2,Disappointing,"I have had no real problems with my B40 coffee maker until I made the mistake of following the cleaning instructions stamped into the plastic beneath the lid of the water reservoir. The instructions read: ""To Clean Lid: Wipe With Damp Cloth, To Clean Reservoir: Dishwasher Safe"". After a run through the dishwasher the reservoir is completely warped, melted, and useless. For the price Keurig asks for their products they should be much more aware of what the instructions, they permenently adhere to the product, will actually do. I would not have run a plastic product through the dishwasher if it did not explicitly say that was the proper method."
1,Won't work!!!,"A week after buying this it just froze up. It makes kind of a gurgling sound but there's no lights on and none of the buttons will do anything. I've tried every way I can think (including the recommendations in the troubleshooting guide) to make this work but it won't. From the rest of the reviews it looks like I got a random dud, but for the money one would think this kind of thing simply should not happen."
3,Coffee Maker is great BUT...,"We purchased the B40 model from Amazon in December and the coffee maker is great, however the reusable filter doesn't work. We bought one and it leaked profusely Keurig sent us a new filter (took 2 months) and it leaked also. That's the extent of the customer service we got. Also they have been out of coffee and cocoa since February. So if you aren't interested in using your own coffeee it's great. The customer service leaves a little to be desired however."
5,Bought For Mom,"This was a xmas gift to my Mom. She loves it, easy to use and clean. the coffee goes fast but its convenient."
5,the review,"on time as specified,this is a big hunk stainless,that does its job,im happy with what it does!!"
1,Razor Sharp? more like a butter knife!,"I bought this because, as an engineer with a background in Safety, I thought the guard is exceptionally well designed. I tried the straight slicer, two of the juilenne blades and the serrated blade. I found them all so dull that they tore rather than cut the food. The cabbage in my coleslaw, well, I ended up cutting about half of it with a knife. I tried peppers, onions and celery, all of which looked chewed rather than sliced. The celery was really rough looking, strings hanging out all over the place. When I tried to slice sweet potatoes into rounds, they cut part way and broke off the rest. I tried all of the above both with and without the guard.My fingers are intact, but I wrenched my back from all the effort that I had to use to get the food to slice, if you can actually call it slicing."
1,wasting money,Well actually I dont have this toy but my cousin does.One day I wanted to see how it worked.I turned it on and walked to get the headphones and the Video Now turned off.I turned it on again but it wouldn't turn on.Dont spend your money and your time.
3,Not up to Jeannette Jenkins Standards.,"I have several Jeannette videos and was disappointed with this one. It seems as if the entire aerobics portion was recorded without the music, with music being randomly selected an added in the editing process. The music is completely inappropriate for most of the moves and Jeannette certainly does not have an internal metronome; she is not able to keep a steady pace. Very disappointng. The strength training portion is good.There are tons great, inexpensive videos out there. If I had it to do over again, I'd pass on this one."
4,None,classic sci fi from the glory days when the hero could beat his advesaries and get the woman! Read it in one day.
5,A poignant tale of loss...and love.,"Amanda Kelly lost her baby, Ian Bonner lost his son. Neither has fully healed. Together they have to find a way to move beyond the past...a way that might lead to love?Brenda Mott crafts a poignant story of loss...and love. A story that will stay with you long after you've read the last page."
2,O Brother!,"Better than many ""birth-order"" books -- Conley doesn't claim to explain everything. But he still has a case to present, and this is a botched job.The writing style will change twice within a single paragraph, from professional to personal, and back again. Anecdotal in the extreme, but the author cherry-picks statistics and selected studies when it suits his purpose (divorce is bad, but, hey, it can be great for some kids, maybe mine).And in the rather absurd Marxist economic outlook, an anti-religion bent, a freeze-dried hippie longing for the 1960s, a surprising lack of focus on child gender, some easily discovered factual errors (Bill Clinton WAS NOT 12 when he met JFK), and the result reminds you of a rather longihs article in a supermarket checkout rack magazine."
5,My Favorite Cheryl Holt book.,Excellent story. Cheryl Holt's characters are so real you wish there was a series of books about their lives. Loved it!
2,Too many cliches,"I have read numerous books on the Great War and I found this book used too many of the cliches of 1960's Great War historians. The whole ""lions led by donkeys"" issue is played up way too much. (attributing the quote to Ludendorff when most historians now figure it was just made up) For example Meyer on several occasions blast generals for pushing on despite losses and then sites other examples of the donkey generals giving up just when victory was at hand. You can't have it both ways. A good overview of the war but it seems to have not relied sufficiently enough on more recent historical analysis of the war."
5,Awesome overview of WWI,"First time venturing into WWI, book was awesome. Was a great overview of the war and was filled with enough interesting details and information about participants to make if feel like a story, not just dry history. The background information included in the book gave me a deeper understanding of the events. One of the most informative histories I have read in a long while."
4,Highly readable with details many Western Front-focused histories omit,"The author is to be commended for a book that manages to cover the entire war on all fronts without letting the story or his writing flag. It's well written and artfully paced, with short ""sidebar"" chapters on specific people, events and issues that break up what might easily have become a monolith."
3,Good introductory text,I enjoyed Meyer's presentation and the organization of the subject matter. He drove me to distraction with his syntax and proclivity for interjecting thoughts into the middle of long sentences. I found myself rereading many passages trying to understand his message. I was surprised his editor allowed this.
2,"Works, just not very good","This headset can be good If you only plan on using it a few hours at a time. Don't think you will be able to sit at work with these on all day, you will be lucky to get more than 3 hours. The USB charging cable that comes with it is fairly short, so you can't use them plugged in while charging unless your head is within a foot or so from the USB port. I use these with my Cingular 8525. I have not been able to connect them to my laptop to listen to music. I do find them comfortable, and they fold nicely into the carrying bag they come with. They do however take a while to connect to my phone, and will not connect if a song is already playing out loud. I will be looking for a better pair of headphones, this is a case of you get what you pay for."
2,Aun Weor propaganda,"I checked this book out at the local library to finally be able to explore the Pistis Sophia, but instead found a piece of religious propaganda for Samuel Aun Woer's organization and mindset. It was so filled with ""if you're part of my club and have studied my lessons, you'll understand my cryptic commentary."" I'm all for different viewpoints, but you really serve no purpose with the "" I know something you don't"" mentality. A commentary should serve to clarify a difficult work for the novice reader, not make it more confusing and stroke your already puffed up ego. There is so much garbage in this book, that I couldn't really use it to pull out the text itself. i think it is better to get Mead's translation and do the research yourself on the side."
5,"Concise, Excellent Material","I used this book for the capstone course of my degree. We had to run a business, which meant that we needed to submit a business plan. After using the instructions given in this book, we had the highest grade in the class.After graduation I have done a lot of reading. This book is an awesome resource to have in a personal library."
5,Perfect!,"They arrived just as described! Love the fresh vanilla smell! There where perfect, I am using them to make homemade vanilla this year as christmas gifts!"
3,chimes peppermint ginger chews,"If you like peppermint more than ginger, this is the Chimes candy for you.My wife said that it tasted like a cough drop.I thought that it was okay, but no where near as good as the straight ginger chews. I only bought them because Amazon was out of stock on the regulars."
5,Finally!!,"Finally, a children's book about being born on February 29th (Leap Year). I've looked for years to find such a book and here it is. This is a great story about Miles' finally getting to celebrate his birthday on the 29th of February. The author did a wonder job on this book and the illustrations are great. Recommended for parents and teachers alike."
3,handmade gift book,Cute ideas. Fast and easy to make. Easy enough to involve kids in the creative phase. Ideas can be used year after year and still look new.
2,Ivy-covered research,"If you're into reading heavy-handed college textbooks then this book is for you! Exhaustively researched and abstrusely (look that one up!) written, it makes Osceola's dynamic and fascinating life as exciting as stale crackers. The author even has the audacity to rate other researchers in the back. The research is exhastive and you will be too once you finish this book. It gave my dictionary a good workout tho!"
5,"Art of Patti Playpal, Awesome Book for the Collector",This book is just what I was looking for. It has lots of information on the various dolls in the Playpal family as well as loads of pictures. The book even gives you tips on cleaning and caring for your Patti's. Love the book and recommend it for anyone that is interested in the Ideal Playpal family dolls. Lots of pictures showing the original outfits and shoes.
3,"nice, but dont expect much scent","first off let me say i LOVE Incense Galore. i have bought several packs of incense from them before and i have loved them all. you cant beat their prices and the quality is just wonderful. however, i was dissapointed in this particular scent. not only was there not much of a chocolate scent to it, but there wasnt much scent at ALL. i have burned 3 sticks of this and each time i could barely even smell it - you couldnt even tell i had any incense lit. i would not buy this scent again but since i adore this line of incense so much i will definetly be buying from them again - just in another scent."
3,An album that you can live without,"This album is alright i guess. Its got i couple of good tracks and a couple of not so good tracks. ""Misery"", ""Bittersweet Heart"" and ""Just Like Anyone"" are great hardrocking tracks. ""Promises Broken"", ""To My Own Devices"" and ""I Did My Best"" were the slower 'worth listening to' tracks that got me playing this CD. They have a country highway kind of vibe in it that i like. Other than that the rest of the tracks are just ergh! ""Caged Rat"" was pretty much a confusion of too many styles that did not blend together at all. I guess they wanted to add some dynamics. It was a mess!"
2,Weak.,"Well what can I say about this album oh yes, weeeeeeeaaaaak.this was a very dissapointing purchase. Cage rat sucks, Bittersweetheart sounds like a country wannabe song.Ok there are a few good tracks, including the song misery, but the rest of the album is not worth your time. If you want someing good pick up: Oasis, the Goo Goo dolls, the Replacements, Nirvana, the Clash, or Rancid."
1,NO NO NO!,"If you want a clarinet-shaped toy, purchase this instrument. If you want a real musical instrument that provides an opportunity for musical development, spend another couple hundred dollars and buy an instrument made in the U.S. or Japan. This object (I can't call it an instrument) is absolutely horrid if it is expected to be used by any level of musician. Please don't waste your money. ""Instruments"" made in China and India are not worth any amount of money. I am a band director and I have been battling these ""brands"" for years. Buyer beware--no one will repair these instruments when they are in need of repair, and they will be in need of repair within a few weeks of use."
5,This is something that everyone can relate to.,"First I would like to congratulate Miss Tanisha John on her first, and very beautiful book. I found this book somewhat amusing at first, but also very sweet and then profound. Considering that it is about love and relationships written in poetic form, it really is a story. It starts off rather ambiguous and leads you right into the beginning of a relationship; trials and tribulations, and things you may think but not necessarily say. It's something that everyone can relate to. And to be honest, the best part of the book was the last chapter because it becomes extremely intimate, personal and provocative. I mean it gets pretty hot and steamy. It makes you wanna holler."
1,HDV users beware,"Very nice program. However, I encountered a flaw for HD users utilizing, as I am, A Sony HDR-HC1 high definition camcorder. The program crashes on attempted capture of video from that device. Numerous attempts have been made to rectify the problem, from hours of discussion in online forums to unanswered online requests to Sony support. The software has been re-installed and all capture options carefully utilized-- all with the same crash on attempted HD video capture. I can capture HD video from my HDR-HC1 camcorder to Adobe Premiere Pro 1.5 without problem. The same attempted capture to Vegas 6 crashes that program. The same problem occurs on different computers, so the crashes are not a camcorder or computer defect. So, until Sony rectifies this problem, I would caution potential buyers to be careful of Vegas 6."
3,HUGE DENT,Nice product but as many had mentioned on their reviews HUGE DENT. At least it was in back of box that it can be hidden but it is also on bottom corner that it wobbles slightly. Don't think it was a packaging problem as it was in a well padded larger box when delivered. Disappointing...
3,STRENGTH,PRODUCT DOES THE JOB. COULD BE MADE STRONGER. DOOR SEEMS FLIMSY. FITS OUR NEEDS AS WE NEEDED A FLAT TOP FOR RADIO
5,It's the best!,"We rescued two 5-month old Miniature Schnauzers and, of course, we wanted to feed them the food that would meet all the requirements needed for growing puppies. I went on the internet to find the guidelines as to the levels needed for healthy bones, skin, teeth, etc. I checked the ingredients of all the major dog foods such as Iams, Science Diet, Eucaneuba and none had the recommended dosage. When I searched ""Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul"", the ingredients and percentages matched exactly to what was recommended. If you don't have your puppy on Chicken Soup, please do so and you will find your puppy is happier and healthier!"
5,Western Saddles: How to Fit: Pain-Free,Great book. Fairly detailed. Purchased this book because we have several horses that are hard to fit. It gave us some great ideas of things to look for and helped us better fit those hard to fit horses.
4,Good product,1st time odering this; defnately would orde agai - good product and arrid when promisd.
5,"MIght be a hard topic to get into, but this book does a great job!",I actually also took this author's class and the book as well as her class on copyright was excellent. What could be a super boring topic was interactive and lots of good sources for copyright free media were shown. Also learned a lot about fair use and copyright laws. A good buy.
1,Just doesn't work for me,"I read all of the positive reviews before ordering this item so was very disappointed to find that this doesn't affect my mood whatsoever. I used it for a month straight. Too late now to send it back. A lot of money wasted. Maybe it works for some, not for others."
5,Works great for me,"Many reviewers commented on a smell while the light was on. I did not notice anything like this at all in my unit. Best of luck to you in your decision about which light box to get but if you think you suffer from SAD, I'd highly recommend trying some light box."
4,SAD light,"I like the light, it seems to help. One of the legs was broken and the copany replaced it without any questions."
2,Sad turned to MAD!,"Box arrived quickly and in excellent condition and that's pretty much where the good part ends. 1 leg attached with some small effort, as the threaded portion of the lamp was 3/4 out of line with the side. the other leg was more difficult, as there was barely any part of the threads visible to try aligning. after an hour of struggling and slight case modification, the leg was attached. frustrated but happy to finally have it together, I placed it on my wife's office desk, plugged it in, flipped the switch, and nothing. Tried the full on position, and 1 lamp in the center lit up. after a few minutes of ranting, I decided that the lamps must have come loose in transit. unfortunately, any #2 phillips head screwdrivers I had in the house are too fat to reach the screws. Will update when able to check the bulbs. At this point, the 2 stars are for build quality and quality control."
4,Very nice light,The light was shipped in good working order and assembled quite easily. I've used it as directed and seems to work well. The main downside is that the legs are rather flimsy.
4,Works great for me,"I am perfectly willing to believe my reaction to this is as much placebo as it is science, but I know that it works for me. Most of the sleepy mornings and early afternoons have disappeared.Very happy with this product"
2,Not worth the money...,"I was excited to receive the lamp and really hoped that it would help with the winter blues. However, I was disappointed when it finally arrived. One of the 3 bulbs was not working and the whole unit was cheaply made - 3 fluorescent lights behind a piece of opaque plastic. I personally believe that light therapy works, but think that your $150 can be better spent elsewhere."
5,Fully met expectations,"This product does exactly what you expect. It is very bright, and easily transportable by removing the legs (it has a built-in ""kick stand"" also). It has a convenient handle too.I can't guarantee that it make you happier, but it does do what it claims."
3,live at billybobs,"needed more of his better hits and less fill in songs, its okay but i think it could be better"
1,Where's all the Spanish Music?,"Are you guys kidding me? Half of the movie's soundtrack is missing! ""Mi Gente"" by Hector Lavoe, ""Che Che Cole"" by Willie Colon, ""Muneca"" by Eddie Palmieri, ""Vieja Luna"" by Celia Cruz & Johnny Pacheco, ""Abuelita"" by Willie Colon & Hector Lavoe, ""Alma con Alma"" by Ray Barretto & Adalberto Santiago, ""El Todopoderoso"" by Hector Lavoe and the best song of the whole freaking movie: ""Para los Rumberos"" by Tito Puente. What happened? Whose pockets were not lined, who wasn't paid off? This soundtrack offering is a joke! Get the Mambo Kings soundtrack, if you want good latin stuff. They are lucky I gave them 1 star. I couldn't give this less."
4,Freight Brokerage startup,"Read the book cover to cover. Some of the contentis useful, some of the content was not. 1/2 the book was very generic to any business startup and didn't add value. I recommend the book but DO NOT purchase through the seller I used. The shipping time is painfully looooong and expensive."
1,Buy a Different Ball,This is a very low quality ball. It does not hold air and it is impossible to remove the air plug everyday to add air. My prior ball I received free with a video and it never lost air!
5,Great work!,Got it in good time and in good condition. I am quite satisfied! It will be a great Christmas present for my Dad!
3,"If I wanted Game Boy music, I'd just listen to mine..","I still like this CD, but I just like songs with words. Besides that, it's great. It's every song from the Game Boy game."
3,Fair,This book starting off as a very good read. There are some really scary sections. The book is one book with five separate stories and characters and at times gets confusing. The book does tie everything together in the end well but the middle section could have been condensed.
5,The Best!,"This book was one of the best books I've ever read. Bentley Little is talented, and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to be scared. -Megan"
2,Exciting in a way.....but nasty!,This book was just down right nasty! The only reason I kept reading was because it had some thrill in it. It made me feel very dirty for reading it. I suggest you don't read it if your not into child molestation.
2,Mediocre at best,"I really wanted to like this book. When I saw a review by Stephen King claiming it to be frightening and impossible to put down, I ordered it. I found it to be neither. One problem I had with The House was that none of the characters seemed to be developed enough for me to really care about them. Maybe there were just too many ""main characters."" I was also disappointed in the ending. The book started out great, with that scary prologue, but I kept waiting for that to tie in with the main part of the book. It never really did, at least not to my satisfaction. I wasn't scared at all by this book; I've read better."
1,Very Disappointed!!,"I bought this watch as a gift. When I received it, it didn't work. The Illini face never showed up. I took it to a local watch repair place and they said the battery inside was not the orginal battery AND it was dead. It would cost $20 to repair. This watch was a hassle... I should have just went and bought one in person!"
3,"Fun, But Where's the Science?","The illustrations are nice, but After Man only touches on one period of time in the future. The books also doesn't explain the scientific basis for its speculations very well. Some of the animals are also rather implausible (especially the flightless bats)."
2,I don't know.,"Can't speak for her experience. I have had a heart transplant and not experienced things like she has...wasn't the book I thought it would be. Maybe true for her, but, not for me. Wishing her a long and happy life."
5,This is THE BOOK for the Inro to Social/Cultural Anthro!,"With short, succinct, comprehensive chapters full of info, high schoolers on up would understand and enjoy this book. Harris traces our cultural history from Australopithecus to the present - from how we began to walk upright, to sex, to gender roles, to commodities, to political systems...it is a fabulous book, a nice refresher read or an informative first-time study!"
5,Excellent Cultural Anthropology - Fascinating Insights,"Okay, I loved the book. A.K.A. - It fits with my prejudices. That aside, there are several points which make this a good book to read.First, Mr. Harris lays ideas out in a consice, understandable format with a cunning sense of humor.Second, Mr. Harris's ideas are quite thought provoking, and the pattern with which he describes human behavior while relating it to more 'primitive' cultures was very refreshing.For those people looking for something to believe in, try the bible. For those who would like to THINK about things, try this book."
2,Not THAT funny,This movie was not that funny....there were a few jokes here and there. I have a good sense of humor and i absolutely love to laugh but this didn't do it.
2,Cover Art Doesn't Tell,"Yes, lame as another review states, a bit like a TV Soapy, bought back memories of ""The Young and the Restless'Don't expect the excitement shown by the young lady on the cover."
2,Lame acting and too long.,"With the exception maybe of McDowell, I dont know how they could assemble a more lame set of actors. The story was okay, but nothing new. It was about 80 minutes too long."
5,Great Product for My Husband found at Amazon,"Upon getting older and a very thinning hairline, my husband decided to shave his head. He looked for something that would do the trick. He found the Vidal Sasson VSCL907 Balder/Fader and used it happily for several years before it just tuckered out. We looked all over for a new one, but to no avail. Finally I looked on the product site to find out where they sold them or even if they were still on the market. We got a list of stores that supposedly carried them. We took a few days and visited every store on the list to find one, but to no avail. (He loved this product that much).Finally we found the product on Amazon.com and sent for it right away. The product arrived and my husband was re-united with his second love. (I am, of course, his first love). Hopefully they will never stop making this product and my husband will be content and happy for the rest of his life."
1,Not as good as i thought.,It's a good design but the clippers isn't strong enough compared to the regular clippers. If this was design was like a lint remover i think it'll be easier to use.
5,A wonderful upgrade!,"I read both of CJ's previous books on this topic and found them challenging and convicting, but also too brief. I was left with with thought...""I wish he had said more on this or that.."". I have not had that reaction as I have started reading, ""Living the cross centered life."" Although I have not finished it, I think he has done a great job of filling in the gaps. I recommend this book, even if you have read his first edition."
1,Piece of SH*T (would have given it 0 stars but I cant),"For christmas my parents bought me this wireless controller so right after I opened I went to go try it out. The reciever would never pick up the signal and I couldn't even get the controller to turn on. I tried putting in several different batteries and nothing. So I tried to call the company for help, of course nobody was there so I left a message and I never got a reply from them. I kept calling and leaving messages but never ever got a reply. So I returned it to the store and got a sony controller that I knew would work for 10 bux cheaper. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!"
5,It's by Meatloaf. Need i say more?,this album rocks it has some doubles but overall it is great. Try driving at night in summer with the windows (or even better the roof) down with this blaring out the stereo at full volume. FANTASTIC !!
2,Marginally useful,"I was frankly disappointed in this book. I'm not a graphic designer, although I am fairly artistic. I got all I needed from this book in the first chapter or 2.Seems like most of it is the author playing with shapes in Photoshop.It's pretty much just shapes and manipulating them and repeating them, reversing them, alternating them, and on and on.The writing is very pedagogic.Maybe that's what graphic designers like. But if you're looking for a design book so you can layout a website better, this is not it."
2,"Different Problem, but Still A Problem","Power On Board TrailTracker Sport Lantern Weather Radio by VectorGreat idea, too bad it doesn't work. My problem is that my main light works but my LED lights do not. The removable battery does not seem to hold a charge very well. This lantern should be recalled. I am disappointed in Sam's Club and Black and Decker."
1,Piece of Crap,I would have given o stars but that wasnt an option. Same problem as everyone has experienced. Main lamp quit working after 3 uses. The main lamp is powered by the internal battery only. It will not iuminate at allwhen plugged in and using DC power. It is 100% dependent on the internal battery which is charged by the DC battery pack but when the internal battery dies the battery pack is useless. The internal battery wasa proprietary to Vector and no one sells it! Shame on Black & Decker is right! They screwed poeple with a bad product and then screw um again by not selling parts for it.If they simply carried the internal battery which can be easily replaced the units would work. Last B&D; product I will ever buy.
2,The WORST Star Wars book ever written!!,"The first two books in the series are good, but this book HASNO ACTION!!BOBA FETT WOULD BE EMBARASSED."
1,completely dull,The author tries to develop a huge web of intrigue and deceit but leaves a book full of nonsense situations trying to cover the huge gaps found in the plot and with unbeliavably stupid situations. The characters are completely superficial and the author gives attention to characters nobody wants to know about instead of potentially interesting characters like Bossk and Zuckuss. The only reason I read this is because it is StarWars after all and because I had already bought the first two books.For the first time I can say that reading a book was painfull and uncomfortable.
2,An intricate web is nearly finished.,"Like the spidery characters of the Assemblers, author K.W. Jeter has built a web of conspiracy for Boba Fett, Dengar, and Neelah to get out of. But will they, and in one piece? Will readers even care what happens to unlikable characters trapped into doing business with unsavory individuals? Only reading this conclusion to The Bounty Hunter Wars trilogy will tell. As with the first two books (The Mandalorian Armor and Slave Ship) there are almost no characters to really care about, but plenty of back stabbing and blood shed to maintain interest. While not a highlight of the alternate universe Star Wars novels, most fans will enjoy the series on one level or another."
3,"Good material but too many obvious ""secrets""","An interesting book and a good read. My only annoyance (and I've noticed this in the other recent books) is that the 'conspiracies' of Shadowrun have taken a much larger role in the game. Whereas before they were background fluff and could be ignored now they are as obvious as a bat to the head. 'Secrets' scream at you from every page and if you counted up the pages discussing them you would now understand why so much of the original text was cut. It's incredibly annoying unless you really love that aspect of SR.Get it for the excellent ideas and game mechanics. Don't get it for the background material. I can only hope the authors release the cut material on the web (how bout' it chummer?)And FASA, for the love of god drop this lame new comic-book style direction. Get rid of the immortal elves, passe evil AIs and omniscient dragons from the past."
1,This book demeans its subject,"How do you give no stars?This book is the worst form of racist patronization.Among combat veterans, your deeds speak for you. The deeds of this TD Battalion - and many other units, both ""colored"" and all white - have gone too long unacknowledged. But to shamelessly manufacture ""exploits"" is the lowest form of boasting, and simple demeans these men's true accomplishments.To paraphrase (only because I cannot recall the exact words) the words of one of the unit veterans who decried this book, ""What we did speaks for itself"". I don't think anything else need be said about this bogus history."
2,What were the National Book Award people thinking?,"With one (weak) exception, the stories in the book showed only that Andrea Barrett knows about science, but little else. Paint-by-numbers prose and some interesting anecdotes about birds and peas don't make for telling, insightful, or even interesting reading. Try Alice Munro, instead."
3,Uneven Collection Makes for a Difficult Review,"I'm in complete agreement with the reviewers who pronounced this to be an uneven work. I think Ms Barrett is actually strongest with the stories that deal more with the gifted amateurs than with the professional scientists. ""Rare Bird"" and ""Ship Fever"" itself were the strongest pieces, and the only ones that I had a real emotional response to (for me the novella in particular since my great-great-great grandmother was one of the thousands who perished in sight of land in the Gulf of St. Lawrence). I also agree that the ""Marberg Sisters"" in particular was quite poor. Still, one must applaud a writer who dares to venture out beyond suburban angst, and since her writing is stylish throughout (no matter what the merits of a particular piece) I would enjoy reading a more extended work from her."
4,Brilliant,"This one is hard to put down. Matheny's novella delicately captures the youth culture of Southern California, where the price of your house is the measure of your value to society. I was extremely impressed when I found out this was Eric Matheny's first published work, he is a master of dialogue and he truly loves his characters. Refreshing plot with exciting twists. This would make a wonderful choice for a little, laid-back, SoCal beach reading. It's like ""The O.C"" for smart people. This book came highly recommended to me and I highly recommend it to everyone else."
3,Same as the OOP King Biscuit CD but different running order,"The music on this disc is great. But it's the same as both the official King Biscuit release, now OOP, and the disc just called Greg Lake Live from Pet Rock Records. However, the running order on the Pet Rock's ""LIVE"" is the same as the KBFH. Here, on this import from Holland, the running order is vastly different, and some of the between song chatter is missing, as are some of the some of the song introductions.Get the Pet Rock version if you can't find the KBFH version. Both are comparable in price with this mistracked CD."
4,Christian Scott starts finding his sound,"""Rewind That"" was Christian Scott's first CD, and it's pretty good, though he's gotten better. Scott has a limpid, breathy trumpet style, and he likes a modern rhythm. The rhythms on ""Anthem"" and ""Yesterday You Said Tomorrow"" are modern and interesting, but there are a few places on ""Rewind That"" where he slips into smoothness, like on ""So What"". More of the songs are better, like on ""Kiel"" with its haunting melody that sticks around after the CD finishes. Scott is finding his own sound on this, and ""Rewind That"" is a good CD, though I recommend trying ""Anthem"" and ""Yesterday You Said Tomorrow"" first."
3,Exciting but graphic,"Tami Hoag seems to be determined to enter the serial killer sweepstakes with ASHES TO ASHES. She creates a dark, violent atmosphere; almost claustrophobic at times. Her characters are as trapped by their pasts as they are mired in the search for the mass murderer.As much as I liked NIGHT SINS and GUILTY AS SIN, I found parts of ASHES TO ASHES painful to read. Tami Hoag gives the reader more details than they need to know -- unless your are a coroner! I am not sqeamish, John Sandford is one of my favorite authors, but I have never felt pushed to the edge of comfort by his books.On the plus side, the plotting and character development kept me reading well into the night, and though I was disappointed by the heroine in jeopardy ploy at the end, I would like to read Hoag's next book which will feature some of the characters in ASHES. Just tone down the graphic descriptions, Tami. You don't need them to illustrate your villain's evil deeds. We already know!"
3,Decent Read,"This was not the best book I've ever read, but I think the ending was a surprise and was pretty good."
2,Gratuitously violent and graphic.,"NIGHT SINS and GUILTY AS SIN were very exciting and two of my favorite thrillers. I was very disappointed in ASHES as the author seems almost pornographic in her presentation. I am not a prude but found the graphic descriptions of torture really unnecessary. It appeals to prurient interests and, in that respect, I found it disturbing. Ms. Hoag is such a great storyteller and she doesn't need to emphasize this angle to capture her audience."
4,A Good Read,"Nicely written, and she's continuing to move away from her romance novel days. Good degree of suspense, and nice twisty ending."
3,How Many Characters is Too Many???,I've enjoyed a number of Tami Hoag's books in the past but unfortunately this one left me hungry for a good Patricia Cornwell. So many passages seemed to be included for nothing more than page fill to get the word count up and so many characters were introduced within the first few chapters -- some even with nicknames -- that I seriously thought about keeping a score card to keep everyone straight. There were also enough transparent red herrings to open a fish market.Will I read Hoag again? Probably...
4,Edge of the seat stuff!,"This is my first novel by Tami Hoag. I like to read thrillers now and again and with Ashes to Ashes I wasn't disappointed.A good thriller, for me, needs to have some basic ingredients; believable characters, well developed plots, moments that have me turning the pages with a sense of anxiety and suspense, finally on that last page I want to be left feeling just a touch uneasy. Ashes to Ashes succeeded on every point!You can read about the plot of the novel elsewhere but be ready for twists and turns that will keep you involved in the story all the way through. Tami Hoag writes with skill and conviction and although at times I found small parts of Ashes to Ashes to be a little predictable this did not detract at all from my enjoyment of it.I don't often delve into the land of the thriller, with Ashes to Ashes I'm glad I did."
1,Sigh... another typical thriller,"It's too bad that all these so-called ""pycho-thrillers"" are all starting to read alike. This one reminded me so much of ""Billy Straight"" by Jonathan Kellerman, with the father as the possible suspect ""deal"". Tami Hoag barely delves into the mind of her killer, just a few mind bits here and there, and most of the book takes place with everyone else trying to figure out their emotions. And then when you find out who the killer actually is - you're still left wondering why? As for it being graphic, it barely scrapes the gore surface. I'll pass on the next one..."
2,Almost had me,I read a few reviews and thought the book sound interesting. And then I read it. I must admit the end surprised me but not big time. Not enough detail and I never quite felt any compassion for the victims. The author did not build up any real anxiety leading to the deaths and therefore I was never really scared. I will not give up just yet though Id like to read her work again and with that I guess the author suceeded in her biggest goal. She now has another fan.
1,Is this book for real?!!,"I have a child with disabilities and the title of this book is extremely offensive. I wouldn't buy it just for that reason alone. How could anyone take any type of advice from someone who can't even refer to those who have disabilities in a respectful manner. If I could rate this 0 stars, I would, however Amazon doesn't allow that."
3,Just okay,"Mr. Allen is not the greatest writer in the world. He tried hard, and the subject matter is interesting, but the writing itself often comes off as something that was penned by a high school student writing a report."
2,"Evenhanded, to a fault","Probably no one ever examined the Vatican, or Holy See, or the Curia to this extent, and I guess American Catholics should be glad there is a non-clerical person doing the examination, but Allen is so even-handed that he seems to question nothing, and everything. In his chronology of the sexual abuse crisis Allen could be writing about trade tariffs instead of horrific crimes covered up by his sources, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. And that's the problem."
2,It's Not About You,"Leigh Montville's biography offers a wealth of information. Unfortunately, Montville, like other failed biographers, refuses to let his subject stand alone on the stage. Somerset Maugham once said ""The best style is the style you don't notice."" The successful biographers know that they need to stay out of the way of their subject. Montville's writing style repeatedly intrudes on the text and reminds the reader that the author is always present, vying for the light. That's too bad for a book so well researched. For me, it's a fatal flaw for a biographer."
5,If you love baseball and The Babe don't miss this excellent book!!,"After reading Robert Creamer's wonderful biography of The Babe, I didn't truly believe that there would be another one that would ever even approach it. However, Leigh Montville has written and researched a book that comes very close to at least equaling it. Apparently, it was also based upon some recently discovered sources such as letters, etc. There are also many wonderful photographs, some rarely seen or published before in any form.For anyone who really loves baseball and The Babe, any new material or facts or photos of the legendary, one-and-only Bambino all combine to make The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth a must have for any fan of Babe Ruth, the Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees and baseball itself. Highly recommended!!"
5,If it weren't for Bob,"Where else would we hear such great, traditional songs arranged and performed in Bob's own magical way? Sure, his voice is more raspy than ever, but he delivers with strong, raw feeling. I truly appreciate the songs Bob picked for this album and even learned some of them on the guitar and love playing them because they are so real and personal. If you want pretty, polished and over-produced, buy a Celion Dion album(spelling is probably wrong, but who cares?)- if you want something real and artistic, Dylan is the answer!"
5,BOB GOES BLUE,"Dylan,his guitar,his harmonica and his voice oh and 10 great blues/folk songs.WORLD GONE WRONG has a masterful pureness that only a giant like DYLAN could achieve.The songs arent his but they are all precious gems in his care.Ive played this album over and over and it ranks up their with any thing that the great man has done.If your are a serious DYLAN fan then you must NOT repeat must NOT be without this.Its angry its sad its honest its just fabulous."
5,Perfect,"I purchased these after looking at a smilar product at the last remaining big-box store that sells primarily home goods. They had identical hangers for nearly double the price. I am very happy with them, and will order more soon. Nice thick shoulders keep sport coat/suit jackets in proper shape. They are a nice wieght, which makes you feel that you have a nice, quality product. I did not encounter any issues with cracks or workmanship problems."
3,Food for thought,"Although I am concerned with the ""scorched earth"" philosophy that can occur when Purpose Driven driven pastors start ""redoing"" church please don't ""throw the baby out with the bath water."" I pastor a conservative and largely traditional church and we are successfully applying many of the principles that our leadership has discovered through PDC and like concepts. We are true to our values and ""what got us here"" while transitioning ourselves to be in a better position to be used by God in the harvest. With that said, we found the book to be helpful in our envisioning process. It is well written. It can be read by everyone on your leadership team without going over anyone's head. It is food for thought and you can leave off what doesn't apply. Let me add that if you fear upsetting those who refuse to budge out of a ministry model from the seventies, you probably will not like this book. Just keep doing what you have been doing. Or what they let you do."
1,How to Hijack a Church and Make Yourself King,How can the author propose such pure sinful processes for taking over a church? How can anyone who used the tactics in this book ever take communion again. This is the most disgusting book I have ever read.
2,A failure in Sony design standards and warranty support,"As noted in other reviews, this product is not designed or built to the usually high Sony standards. The LCD screen WILL break under normal use and Sony will not honor the warranty if the screen fails. My screen failed after six months and I returned the computer to Sony for repairs. Sony charged me over $700 and refused to return the 'physically damaged screen' as I requested so that the 'intentional damage' that I 'caused' could be verified. To confirm that this is a design flaw Sony included with the repaired computer NEW instructions as to how to prevent damaging the screen noting that 'the LCD screen may be sensitive to pressure or added stress'. This product is a sad commentary on Sony's design standards and on its unwillingness to stand behind its warranty."
3,Not Ms. Montgomery's best...,"Sy Montgomery has written some wonderful books about animals. This one has some touching moments, but I don't think it's one of her best. I, too, was put off by some of her egotistical comments. The detailed enumeration of the contents of Christopher's slop pail were just not that interesting--and the lists were repeated endlessly. The book can be summed up in two sentences: ""This is a story about a pig who lived a long and happy life. People liked to rub his belly and see him eat, and they donated food to him frequently."" For me, the book just doesn't answer the ""so what?"" question. If you want a wonderful book by the same author, read THE TARANTULA SCIENTIST."
4,Animal Attraction: Nice Tale of Unconditional Love,"If there is reincarnation, I want to come back as one of the author's pets. An interesting foil and comparison between the author's unconditional love for a pet pig versus her strained relationship with her parents, who nedver seem to forgive her for marrying a Jewish man."
2,O.K.,"This is a fine lamp. The merchant was quite unpleasant to deal with, and we wouldn't buy from them again."
3,Please remove picture with the shade,"The lamp is not bad but when I ordered it, there was ony one picture and it had a beautiful, little shade. I incorrectly assumed I was purchasing the product in the picture. I will keep the lamp but will be more cautious in the future. This is the first time an Amazon purchase did not live up to my expectations and I will probably not order from this seller again.I wish they offered the shade for sale."
5,Great rock from the great combination of Ann Lewis and Pinx!,"I am very happy I purchased this great sounding CD. Classic J-rock does not get any better than this. Ann's vocals are strong and sensual, and her backup band Pinx really knows how to rock! Highly recommended."
5,JAMES AND EUROPE,A classic by a genius. No American understood Europe better. In this one he adds the twist of Europeanized Americans absorbing the centuries-old European ennui and cynicism that still freaks out Red State Americans to this very day.
2,Intermediate to Advanced Book,I bought this book because I thought it would be a comprehensive introduction to the art of sewing. This book is more a desk reference than a learning tool. I still need another book to actually learn how to do anything with a sewing machine.
4,Air filter,"The filter seems to be just the same as the original one that came with the unit. Just easily cut to the size of the old one and set it place, seems to be working just fine!"
5,hunter filter,"great product, I like that you can cut it yourself, I was able to cut what I want and it lasted a long time this way."
1,Poor quality. not what I expected!,"Product was made of lower quality material than I was expecting, and the color was much different than expecting."
5,5+++,"Wonderful for adults and teens who are learning about WWII. I just finished this book and found it to be wonderful, truly one of the great books about counterintelligence in WWII and the Resistance. As a teacher and as a librarian I would highly recommend this for history studies. As an adult avid reader who is very discriminating I, personally, found this to be a superior book. The true story of this young man, his contacts, travels,and experiences have suspense, and show courage, intelligence and daring."
4,BRIGHT LIGHT,"I have seen many rear tail lights through the years (i ride pretty slow) and not one is as bright as this little light. Its easy to use and lasts forever. For the money, nothing comapres."
5,Easily visible,"This little gem is almost blindingly bright - not something you want to look at at close range, but sure does the trick for an early morning jog. It's also better made than the junky flasher I had picked up at a sports store. Plus, I've dropped it on the concrete at least a half dozen times so far & it's still holding up. Definitely a worthwhile investment!"
1,Incomplete,Sunday & Monday are frequently missing content that is available elsewhere on MN sites. I'm canceling my MN Kindle subscripton today.
4,Great supplemental newspaper.,"I've had a print and electronic subscription to the WSJ for years. As soon as I got a Kindle, I picked up a Kindle subscription to the WSJ as well.When I noticed that there was a Kindle edition of the SJMN available, I figured it was worth a trial. (I've never bothered with a print subscription to the SJMN. I couldn't justify the cost or annoyance of unread newspapers stacking up/vacation holds/etc.)Like another reviewer, what really works for me is the ability to read bits and pieces of the newspaper when I've got a few free minutes. I read the WSJ in its entirety. I read the the SJMN for its local content and am very satisfied. $6/mo to stay up-to-date on local news is a great bargain!"
1,Does not work,"Do not believe any of these reviews, i bought this for my neighbors shelty, i could tell that the dog could hear it because she would look at it when it went off, but that was it it did not stop her at all, in fact when she was done barking she laid down directly in front of this and went to sleep. Save your money, i wish i had."
2,Keep it dry!,"It is definitely not waterproof !! After a rain, I picked it up, tilted it and water ran out of the DC adapter (not supplied) connector opening. Water had not gotten in to the controls panel which has a cover, but leaked in somewhere else. The unit is now apart as I try to get it dry and working again.As to working; it seems to work somewhat, but in my case I cannot get direct line of earshot between it and the next door dog because of a wood fence. The fence does have spaces between the boards and I think some sound bounces off the eaves over the fence, so I think maybe I have 10% getting thru.Again this unit is not water tight and will fail if it gets wet."
1,does not work!!!,"This machine is horrible! The noise emitted from it bothered my dog, but apparently, not enough to keep her from barking. The noise never once stopped her from barking right away as advertised, but if she did stop barking anyway, the noise did not stop like it was supposed to. So she had no way of ""controlling"" it. It went off constantly in the sensitive postion even if a car drove by on the street 30 yards away. If we moved the dial down far enough so it wasn't going off for no reason, the bark wasn't always enough to set it off at that point. We tried it daily for over a week, then sent it back. By the way, check the return policy before buying!!! We had to pay a ""restocking"" fee!!"
2,Useless,This did not work at all - don't waste your money. There was no noticeable difference at all in dog intensity barking
2,Not enough Range,"I set this up to discourage my neighbors dogs from coming to their fence and barking non-stop whenever I go out into the yard. The unit was set up just 20' from the dogs (across a narrow dirt driveway). Although I verified it was working, it had no effect on the dogs. I'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 just because ""I don't like it"" sounds better than ""I hate it"". There's just really no answer to a neighbor's barking dogs if the neighbor just doesn't care. Maybe a Super-duper Bark Stop powered by 120 volts with about 10 times the output might do the trick."
4,I enjoyed 2 of the three stories,I like reading anthologies. The first two stories were wonderful. Characters and story line kept you reading until the happy ending. The first story is Colorado Wife by Cheryl St. John. It teaches you can't judge a book by it's cover. or a person for that matter. The two main chacters are lovable and the orphan children so special. Second story Jubal's Gift by Elizabeth Lane was my favorite .It is a story of love and forgiveness for wrongs long past. I had tears of happiness at the end. Third story was so so. It was Until Christmas by Mary Burton. It was slow moving and very easy to know the ending.
5,Christmas Gold is Platinum,"As always, another snuggle under the covers and don't put down the book until it's finished, story by Cheryl Saint John. The characters are warm and lovable and the story is so sweet. I really rooted for Sam Calhoun to sweep Rosalyne Emery off of her feet. It's the only time I can think of that a man has actually been right... Well done!"
5,Linux Admin made easy -- at last,"Jamie Cameron's book is a fantastic voyage inside what I think is one of the most important administration based tools available. He has created a very unique and easy to use masterpiece that makes the daily (and not so daily) administration tasks easy to perform - both remotely and on-site. The book gives a more in depth look at the application he's built and you get a better understanding of how it works, saves you time and money.

4,Interesting,This book was different on a spiritual level. It talks about changing your schedule. This can affect your spirituality. The goal is to change things around so that you don't rush everything. If we don't make this change we can leave God out of the picture.
1,Terrible,"I've had 4 of these and while they control and handle great, they are not durable at all. They break all the time. The switches inside always go bad. I even repaired one and it still went bad after a few months. These sticks just aren't manufactured very well. I don't see how they make it out of quality assurance. Stick with the Hori sticks, I've had much better luck with those."
1,"Awful treble, but great at block outside sounds","I received these headphones second hand, so I compared them with my existing headphones, a Sennheiesr HD-555. The Coby headphones are truly awful in the high-note range, all of the treble is lost. The mid-ranges came in, though it too seemed muffled. Only the bass seemed good.Even the default earbuds that you get with an iPod are much better in audio quality.The only redeeming factor in these headphones is that they are great at blocking outside sounds."
5,The first book to make me cry!,"From Anna is a great book by Jean Little, a girl who moves from Hitler's Germany to Canada. Anna is the odd-one-out, but no one suspects the real reason for her clumsiness until a kind doctor figures it out. A wonderful story. I'll always treasure having read it."
3,A little slow for me,The album was alright but most of the songs on there were slow. dont let Holla fool like it did me.
1,Too small!!!,"I bought 3 of Springmaid's crib sheets. None of them can fit the crib mattress!!! I went to Target and Walmart, just bought 3 more, and they all fit well!!I agree with the last review, what is wrong?Now I have to use them for other uses."
4,Godmother,"Cute little book that I sent to my goddaughter's family to share. I love flowers, especially lilies, so this was particularly nice. Good reminder of Easter story."
3,WR at their commercial peak,"when they issued this album in 1979, the band was at their commercial heights, and unfortunately it shows in the music, which doesn't have much drive or exploration. the live version of jaco's ""teen town"" is so damn slick, rather than open-ended and somewhat naked what it was on the original album. what i always liked about the band was their multi-layered compositions along with some synthesizer experimentation, plus wayne shorter playing some beautiful solos. this record misses much of the beauty of their earlier days. if you want to hear good world-music-influenced fusion, you're better off buying miles davis' fantastic live album ""pangaea""."
2,Biased and inaccurate,"Factually inaccurate and full of right wing American claptrap. I was stunned by how a man like John Steinbeck could have been so easily taken in by all the lies that surrounded the USAID effort and the role of Lima Site 20, Ban Sam Thong, as presenting to the world the `acceptable` face of US AID involvement in Laos. Edgar Buell was fully aware of the position of Vang Pao and his involvement in running opium from the very beginning yet did nothing to prevent it. Indeed, he later ,made no real attempt to prevent some Hmong villages that refused to conscript children into the CIA's secret army being denied food and subsequently being targeted by US air strikes so creating yet more of those refugees that he was supposedy intent on helping.Fortunately there are now some far more balanced records available covering this sad time, so my advice would have to be, save your money."
1,Garbage,"Very little insight into international marine insurance or any fraud attached to it will be gained from reading this badly written book. Geary appears to be a yacht surveyor in the Caribbean, a very small part of marine surveying, the book is a catalogue of his exploits in this area and is a thinly veiled advertisement for using his services. There is nothing in here about the day to day practice of international, commercial marine insurance and marine surveying as applied to merchant vessels, which he appears not to know about or to have participated in. As for the problems with Salvage Association or Lloyd's agency , which the cover of the book says he will reveal, what he says is laughable and does not bear any other comment.Reading this book will not give anyone any insight into marine insurance or its problems and certainly not commercial marine surveying, except, perhaps if they own a rather small yacht in the West Indies"
5,Excellent succinct resource,"This volume is another volume in the Handing on the Faith series, sharing the common format - a brief chapter, questions for reflection and discussion, quotations from the Scripture, the catechism and the General Directory for Catechesis. The volume begins with an introductory chapter followed by four chapters, each focusing on a gift: the gift of faith, the gift og prayer and ritual, the gift of community, and the gift of self. Within these building blocks, beginning with a brief experience from real life, the book simply and quietly instills a solid sense of catechesis built on living the faith within community. It retains a real sense of the doable - for example, for outreach, preschoolers could draw pictures for the homebound. If you want solid theology in a down-to-earth, reassuring format, this volume is excellent."
1,NOT for destructive dogs,"My 11 month old Rhodesian Ridgeback mix destroyed this ball in less than 30 minutes. It was one of the worst Kong toys we've ever tried, would NOT recommend if you have a destructive chewer."
2,Not great for large/strong dogs,"My dog popped the ball and therefore broke the squeeker in it in under 30 seconds. How disappointing...If you have a very large and strong dog like me, don't waste your money."
1,Squeakier lasted 3 minutes.,"We bought one of these at Pets-Mart. Our dog around 75 pounds loves it. Broke the squeakier in 3 days (maybe 45 minutes of play time). Tears the ball apart in 6 days. So we ordered two more off Amazon. We just received them in the mail.We excitedly give the dog one of his new Squeakier Balls. My wife walks in and says, ""and the Neighbors thank you"" because the squeaking so loud :), which is good for the Dog. 3 minutes later and the squeakier is broken. That was probably best for the neighbors sanity tonight.Dog loves it. Perfect size. But he does tear them to shreds & and the squeakers don't last long."
2,Not sturdy,My two APBTs had this ball in pieces in less than two minutes. This is my second Kong product that did not meet expectations as Kong advertises sturdy products for larger dogs.
5,great buy!,My pitbull mix loves this toy! When I found it on amazon I thought for the price who cares if he pulls it to pieces. I was shocked to find it has been over a month and the ball is still around and squeeking. He always has it with him. Great buy!!
3,pamphlet,"this is a stapled pamphlet featuring black and white photos of cheap perfume bottles, just fyi. no antique bottles are covered. no art glass. just vintage inexpensive bottles."
2,Wonderful while it lasted,"This was my second Ottlight. The first lasted more than two years and the second less than one year. I like this light very much but the useful life is too short to justify the purchase of a third. I want to suggest to the company's engineers that they have a problem with thier ballast. Also, the light seems to be unrepairable. I'm going to try a lower price Ott light. I won't like it as well but to heck with a company that makes a good product and engineers it for failure in less than a year."
5,AMAZING BOOTS,"Wow...these boots are not only extremely comfortable, but they are super cute too! The go great with everything. I own them in black, but I'm dying to own them in brown as well. They are not real leather so you can wear them in the rain and in the snow, where I live that is very important. They are just so dang cute. I wore them the entire day the other day and went to a concert and everything and they were comfortable the whole day. All I can say is that these boots are worth the money :)"
5,The best book on Yoga Psychology,This is the best book on yoga psychology i have read. Very complete. A must for every psychologist and yogis. Really enjoy the reading and is deepness. Is not some shallow reading like others I have read. Pure science of the soul.
1,please dont waste your money,I had a 30 day warranty and 40 days after purchase ipod could not keep a charge for 20 minutes. I ordered a new battery and same thing. bad refurb now I wont buy any refurb again.
4,Somehow the title should've mentioned how great this CD is,"From the title, you might think Relaxin' is the most laid-back of the 4 albums made from the giant Prestige sessions. Actually, the song tempos are mostly up-beat. Oleo seems to cook along. This CD is better than ""Workin'"", and about equal to ""Steamin'"". I don't have ""Cookin'"" yet. I have two live Miles Davis versions of ""If I Were A Bell"", and this version is better than either one (though not a live album, these songs were mostly done in one take). ""You're My Everything"" might the most relaxing song on the set. There are toe-tapping versions of ""I Could Write A Book"" and ""Oleo"". ""It Could Happen To You"" is another easier-swinging song, then the CD ends with Dizzy's ""Woody'N You"". Miles' trumpet is in fine form, and Coltrane is good, though his best work was yet to come. Anyone who likes mid-50's jazz should get this CD."
3,Just Because,"This is a great toy for very young children/toddlers. My 2 year old loves to play with it but grows tired of it very fast as it does not do much. I have no complaints on the quality as ours has been dropped several times.I do complain about the cost of this item and the limited functionality of it. You simply have four events and then repeat them until you grow tired of playing. Not the best tool for developing motor skills or anything else for that matter. However, it is a cute toy and my toddler does return to it every couple of days."
2,Broken.,"I gave this album 2 stars because this is apparently the same band that produced ""Logic Will Break Your Heart"", although you would never know this by listening to ""Without Feathers"". As other people have noted, this album is infinitely different than the amazing ""Logic Will Break Your Heart"". I fell in love with ""Logic.."", and when this album came out I was first in line to pick it up.After a thorough listen, I examined the packaging. I thought, ""Did I buy the wrong cd? Dear God, please, did someone accidently place a different cd in this case?"" But, to my dismay, it was The Stills. Say what you want about this album, but I don't see how anyone who really felt ""Logic..."" could be anything but disappointed in this album. I've tried examining it from a different angle. I've given it a ""fresh listen"". Nothing. I got the same feeling from this album that I got after I watching ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"". What happened to the magic, man?!"
2,Not all changes are good unfortunatelly.,"It seems that the original sound they produced in previous works has finally left them. This work may not be terrible but it sounds like a clone between Coldplay or Keane love songs, very slow, mellow sounds. Unfortunally they don't rock anymore, some teenage girls will probably like this but for the people that hoped for some great material like Killer Bees or Still in Love from their debut EP this material is not even a far cry. I really wonder what went wrong..."
3,DO NOT GET THIS CONFUSED WITH DOLLS the HORROR FLICK!,"Somehow this movie comes up RELATED to DOLLS the horror Film, it is not. Rather a soft Exotic film about a woman torn between becoming a glamourous Model and Her traditions in her Island/Hometown. When I say Exotic I mean a lot of frontal nudity, am am not sure exactly what it is rated, although I think it is R."
5,very cool dino,"Very neat, detailed & sturdy toy...My boy's love their imaginext dinosaurs (they have them all) The Best part is that you can snap on the caveman's saddle and take him for a ride.. Very cute set! I would definitly recommend buying this toy for a dinosaur loving boy!"
5,simply wonderful,"This is my son's absolute favourite book. I bought this one for him, and since then and have bought all the other Poppy Cat Books. We read one of them every night and he never gets bored with them. Lots of touchy feely bits, gorgeous colours...worth every penny as every Mum will get loads of use out of them"
3,Gently generating genius,"3 1/2LL is undoubtedly a premier collection of 50's saxophone ballads from the up-and-coming horned titan, but lacks the unbounded pulse much of his stronger work possessed and can often, despite potent, if restrained soloing, become mired in standardized predictability."
5,Another Winner,"Like the other Live At Billy Bob's CDs this one is freakin awesome! Cooder Graw is a band full of talent and fire. You can tell they're tearing up the stage and burning down the house on this CD. If you like Cooder Graw or just want to know what they're all about - BUY THIS CD. It's got almost all of the best songs and it's a Live album. My favorite songs are ""Dirty Little Hometown Girl"" and ""State Line"" and ""Llano Estacado"" and well... just about all of them. You get the idea. I like this CD and I think you will too."
4,Great print quality,"Great print quality,and speed. Very good software bundle but wont work on windows 98/ME.And there isnt a version that will work. If you think being able to crop and rotate from the little display on the 730 is worth an extra 50.00 think again ,it's a 2.5"" display,and its hard to see what the end result will be,so save the 50 and get this one. The card reader wont read compact flash from a kodak camera,but works great with my cannon. Easy to load paper tray and print cartrige.k"
2,Prints have green tint to them,"The quality of prints from this printer is disappointing. I did a comparison of prints from this printer and a four year old HP inkjet printer. The inkjet printer had truer skin tones and brighter colors. The Canon printer produced prints with a green cast. Skin tones did not look natural.Worthy to note that this printer does not include a printer cable to connect to a computer.As noted by other reviewers you only can print five prints out of the box. I had a difficult time finding stores that carry the paper/ink for this model.The printer has a number of useful features but it all comes down to the print quality which doesn't compare to other printers on the market.Keep looking, there are better alternatives."
2,Cannon Printer- Selphy CP720,"Providing an ink cartridge that only prints (5) picture is disappointing. When purcahasing this type of product, a full ink cartridge would impress the buyer. I realize consumables are where the money is made, but REALLY,As a gift, the receiver now has to run out and purchase new cartridge, along with TRY AND FIND the paper that fits this thing."
1,Book has the information but is filled with Errors!,I bought this book hoping it to be of the same high quality content as Mr.Black's previous books. I was quite disappointed with the multiple grammatical and technical errors in the book. Seems like this book was published in a hurry without any proof-reading. I have found better books on wireless communications.
2,70s Horror,"This is a pack of 5 movies on two dvds supposedly in vampire genre, with Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things easily being the best film in the package. However, I wouldn't recomend it to anyone but vampire emthusiasts. Supposed nudity announced on the package was nowhere to be found in one film."
3,Havent read it yet,"I bought this book and my brother got his greasy hands on it before I could grab it so I havent had the chance to read it yet. After picking up the Preppy handbook, which nearly made me vomit bile because it was so ridiculous, I am hesitant to even begin reading this book. I really hope that this is better. Can this be the first review of a book on Amazon where the reviewer hasnt even read the book but is just slaggin off another book? Wow. Pretty cool! Anyway, Im giving this 3 stars cause I dont know how this book's gonna be, so 3 stars is like in the middle of the rating system. Well, technically 2.5 stars is but this isnt an option. HIPSTER THIS! SKWEEKAH!!!"
3,Practical Machinery,I believe that this book will help me in my work and will be a benefit to both me and my company
2,Take out Author bias and it would be OK,"Even though every other word in Zartarian's book seemed to be racist this and racist that. The book never proved that David Duke was a racist. On the contrary it showed he was always looking for peaceful ways to advance the civil rights of white people. He helped with boarder patrol to keep out illegal aliens and has helped crusade for equal treatment for white people. He has never been accused of violence. This book, while calling David Duke a racist, shows that he continually encouraged peaceful demonstrations and was even arrested at one and charged with an erroneous charge. Zartarian is to busy pointing his finger and name calling to be taken very seriously."
4,An amazing novel,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the great transitional novel in the series. The first books have action and interesting plot twists, but the tone changes in this book. In the previous books, when Harry Potter wins a battle (aka the conclusion of a book), the reader experiences a feeling that everything is all right and will be right. However, throughout this book and into the next ones, the confident feeling that Harry will survive and defeat Voldemort and restore the peaceful, jovial magical world we knew in the first books is challenged. The changes in Harry's character do not inspire confidence either. The character we embraced and grew with is becoming a snotty, arrogant idiot. I found myself questioning whether the world Harry lives in will ever be the same even if Voldemort is defeated.This is a great book and the beginning of the action that makes this series one of the best I have ever read. I recommend it to all."
4,Not the best but better than the first one,"I have been waiting for the 5th book for about 2 years and then i finally heard it was coming out June 21, 2003 i was so excited. It finally came out we bought 2 one for me and one for my sister. I read it in four days it was ok but the 3rd and the 4th was better. With the 4th one you just had to keep reading and reading. Ou had to fin what was happening next with the Triwizard Tournement. Mrs. Umbrigde is crule mean and evil. J.K. Rowling shouldn't have used her as much as she did. With her being in charge most of the book come on Rowling this book i thought should have been better. More about Voldemort trying to kill harry the book was not as good as the 4th and the 3rd. I say it was about the same rating i would give the Chamber of Secrets. This book was ok but not really really good"
3,eh. it could have been better,"not to much action. especially w/ voldormort or death eaters. kinda slow. i was wondering when the book was going to pick up. the plot was a bit weak, based on one little thing and there are two plot mistakes that i found. compared to the 4th book, this was a bit dissappointing.the personality of harry is drastically different from the previous books and im not sure if this was intentional. other people's personalitiles roles also seems to have changed, even ron's and hermonie's actions seem a bit off. not sure if this is supposed to reflect the children's growing up but even dumbledore's role changed."
2,Well I guess one of them has to be the worst of the Potter series,"I immensely enjoyed Azkaban and Goblet. In my opinion these two were easily the duo of series champs. So Phoenix had its work cut out for it from the start; having to follow two great reads.The editors must have 1) either been afraid to cut down Rowling's work (or maybe they figured, Hey, we all want to spend as much time as we can in Potter world or 2) Rowling threatened any editor who dare lay a finger on her precious words with a Cruciatus curse. But whatever the reason, the first 220 pages could've easily been pared down to about 80.Other than that, the book just didn't have the ooomph of its predecessors. Hope the next two are better."
1,I waited all that time just for this!,I liked all of the other Harry Potter books but I only got 700 pages into this one. Pretty much the only thing that happens in this book is Harry scar is hurting all the time and he get a whole bunch of detentions from Umbrige! It might be the thickest book but it has the least excitment.
1,Waste Of Time To Read This Book,I have been waiting for this book for so long to see what hapens to Harry. When I got this book my mom and I. We thought this book was stupid. We only got to page 90 and stoped. We had to ask a family member how it ended. I told some of my other famliy members the J.K. Rowing can wirte a craby book like this one and still make over a millon dollars. All this book is about is how Harry is so loney. Take it from me do not read this book!!
4,Harry potter,:) $$$$$$:)B):/hi hi hi hi hi hi hi good book for Harry potter fans good bye bye potter fans bye
4,"Good book, but a major flaw","I was just wondering if anyone else noticed the MAJOR mistake between book 4 and this book, regarding the thestrals, those lizard-horse creatures that pull the Hogwart's carriages, only visible to those who have seen someone die. At the end of book 4, after seeing Cedric Diggory die, how is it that Harry somehow does not see the thestrals? It says right on page 725 of book 4 that Ron let Harry keep watch for the carriages. Further on down the page, the text says they were still 'horseless.' Since Harry had seen Cedric die, why was it that Harry did not see the thestrals?Has anybody else picked up on this?"
4,Harry Potter and the order...,I have not read this yet. I had seen some of the movies and loved them. It was decided by my daughter that I should read them all first. I am reading the first one now and love it.
2,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5),"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5) seem to make Harry out to be a spoiled brat who complains about everything and everybody.Having read the book, I wonder how J. K. Rowling could have dragged out a two hundred and fifty page story to create an eight hundred and seventy page book. By page six hundred, I wanted the dark lord to put me out of my misery.Harry constantly belittles his best friends, poor Hagrid drags about dieing all beat up, and there is no real concern as to what happened to him. Then, If the fifteen year old Harry Potter had talked to me the way he ""YELLS"" at the other adults in the story, I would have asked him to move on, not come back, and broke his wand before he left. For book six, I think I will wait for the paperback."
5,Rowling Does It Again!,"The fifth book in the Harry Potter series has proven to be just as facinating as the previous works. Rowlings characters are growing in experience, as well as complexity. The darker elements of Book 5 set a new tone for the series, and may prove to make the future books even more popular than ever. It is another wonderful addition to the Harry Potter collection, keeping kids and adults in this household up all night just to finish it!"
5,Honestly Captivating,"This is the longest book I have ever finished. This story was excellently written, brilliant and captivating. I read ths entire Harry Potter Saga all at once, book 1-5 in 5 months. I feel like I have watched these movies, when they haven't even been made yet! This book, following the previous 4 books of Harry Potter, Rowling truly shows her talents. Children and adults alike can enjoy and escape by reading this book. I wish I would get my letter from Hogwarts! In a way, I feel like I already have. I am waiting impatiently for book 6 & 7 to be released. I highly recommend them to anyone with an imagination!"
2,What a let down!,"Pre-ordered the book and was waiting in anticipation. What a let down!It seems like JKR has written a book for the sake of it and nothing more. There is no coherent plot. Before I read the book, I was pretty sure I'd cry at the death of whoever it was that died, but honestly after reading it, there is only indifference. OKay, so she HAD to kill someone and the pages were running out. So, Sirius, off you go. The HP charecters did look one dimensional so far. By trying to develop a darker side to each personality, she still has not managed to convey depth.Why does fudge suddenly show up and start believing?Totally lame."
2,A Good Start,"This book was more of a rough draft than a final polished story. Most of the characters were still stuck in the same mold they've had since book one. Harry, though, who becomes this angry kid, grates against the senses as the neglected teenager. His anger while justified does not evoke much sympathy, but rather just annoys the hell out of the reader through most of the book. Besides all of this, the book is much too dark and violent for its intended audience, children. The book had some great scenes though, and it seemed like it could have been great from cover to cover with more time and revision."
2,Hugely disappointing,"Yes, I am one of those adults who likes the Harry Potter books. Or at least until this one. Sure, it is still an escape from reality and some of the new characters are interesting, but overall, big thumbs down. The magic and charm (sorry for the bad puns) of the first four is sorely missed here. Book five feels forced, as though she just wanted to get it over and done with. There's no heart or soul to it. I understand that we need to feel the discomfort, claustrophia and pain that the characters are living with, but with nothing pushing the plot along, it was wholly unenjoyable. Three years...so long to wait for so little..."
5,As good as ever!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a wonderful read. Although my favorite book is still the Goblet of fire, this book comes close. Rowling's writing style and plots tend to mature through her books, and this one is no exception.This a very hard book to put down! I'm not going to ruin some of the surprises, and there are many of them. But number 12 Grimmauld Place (Where Harry stays after leaving the Dursleys), is a very interesting place. And best of all is Petunia and Vernon Dursley asking Harry about the Wizarding World! You'll just have to read it to find out more about that. And don't forget Professor Umbridge, who is without a doubt the worst Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Hogwarts has ever seen.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will have you reading non stop until the end."
2,harry potter regresses to a five year old,"i can't believe rowling kept the world waiting for 3 years only to give us a book where harry potter regresses into a 5 year old and whines for 3/4 of the book. ron's stage fright was also over-the-top. the only reason i can recommend for getting this book is that you have to read it in order to know what happened for the next one. that is, if you're not totally turned off the series by the poor writing in this one."
2,Am I supposed to care?,"As a devoted fan and ardent follower of JK Rowling's work, I hate to be the bearer of bad news. But, the truth must be told, and here it is. Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix (now brace yourself) is a bad book.Hear me out: The plot, granted, thickens, and the story has potential to be touching, but this information is presented to you in a way as to be colorless. Harry, fast becoming an exemplary raging delinquent, causes you to become vaguely annoyed with him and not the least bit sympathetic. None of the other characters have developed, and seemed much the same as the day they arrived at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And as for the infamous death scene, I was getting so exasperated with the character I didn't remotely care when he died.All in all, the book seems to have no depth, and JK Rowling's style is getting some what repetitive. I was reeled into the hype and preordered my copy, and I assure you - never again."
5,The New Harry Potter Book is Fabulous,"Rowling continues her magic in her fifth book in the Harry Potter series... It starts off great, and grabs you until the end. Don't miss it."
5,Fantastic Audio Book- Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,My husband does not like to read so we ventured into audio books as an alternative. This audio book (and all in the Harry Potter series) is THE BEST! We truly enjoy the Harry Potter audio books because the narrator Jim Dale is so fantastic. He does all the different character voices so well and really makes the story come to life. These books are good for the whole family- especially on a long car ride!
1,The Horror of Harry,I was appalled at how disappointing this addition to J. K. Rowling collection was. It was heinous to make reader sit through over 800 pages of that garbage. Truly disgusting.
1,Very Boring,"I thought the book was very boring and it was very hard to get through it. It was too long and it was like the other 4 books. Harry gets into trouble, meets Voldemort etc. In each book the same things happen...I thought the 5th book was VERY boring. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. The other ones were better."
5,an awesome book,"The book we've all been waiting for has finally arrived! Harry Potter is now fifteen and in his 5th year at Hogwarts. The wizarding world is divided on the issue of Voldermort's return, and danger is everywhere for our favourite wizard. Cruel teachers, exams, Dementors and nightmares are just a few of the things Harry has to contend with. The end will leave you shocked, as a character we know and love will die. Harry will alos learn the reason why Voldemort wanted to kill him, which is something we've all been waiting for. I never thought any book could beat the 4th book, but this book is simply magnificent. With J.K Rowling's humor, descriptions and incredible imagination, this book has all the makings of a classic. Don't miss it!"
3,Preview of Books 6 and 7?,"Well darn it, isn't anybody going to review this thing?!The wordcount drags the pace down just a bit too far -- there wasn't enough of the energy of Vols. 3 and 4 or the humor of the earlier volumes to give the needed ""lift"".Several expected plot developments skittered across the pages like sheep being trotted past an insomniac, but were pulled out of the line-up before they had covered any ground. If Rowling was attempting to pace herself going slow on plot resolution and character development, I think she has bought time at too high a price.However, look out for one or two promising new characters, and enjoy a little more detail on Sirius' character -- poor guy hasn't had much of a chance in previous books, what with all the plot device work he's been called on to perform! And then, sit back and hope that the sheep are about to be followed by sweeter dreams."
5,Wow!,"When's the next one? An awesome read, a little dark for the younger reader (I'm 37) but well written (as always). Like I said when's #6 due?"
2,Disappointment,I liked the first four books but the fifth was disappointing. Rowling decided to make everything too dinghy and dark for it to fit in Harry Potter. It was really bad and the characters grew up at an unreal rate. It seems like all the characters grew 3 years older in the space of 1 month. Don't read it.
5,The last 300 pages are great!!,"I've been a Harry Potter fan for years now and anxiously looked forward to the Order of the Phoenix. I was not disappointed! While the beginning of the book seemed to drag with the constant angst of Harry I later found it was needed to set us up for the excitement of the last 300 pages. It was like being on a wild rollercoaster ride and when I was finished, I could have kicked myself for reading it so fast. I'm going to have to wait that much longer for the next book that is bound to be even better now that more people believe He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back. This book is definitely less light hearted than the earlier Potter books. There are more mature themes, but they are handled in such a way that they are not really inappropriate for a younger audience. I highly recommend this book for a wide age range."
4,Here he comes to save the day....,"After a long wait, Harry Potter is back. Was it worth the wait? I think so. There were a lot of unanswered questions from the last book, many of which are answered here. Of course, this book brings up many new unanswered questions. I won't go into the plot of the book, because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it yet. This book is actually pretty much review proof. If you read the other four books, you are gonna want to read this one. And if you haven't read the other four books, you shouldn't start with this one, because you will be very confused about what is happening."
2,Too Much of Nothing,"I was disappointed with this installment. It dragged on (in the most repetitive way) about 500 pages too long. The ""revelation"" that either Harry goes or Voldemort was a no-brainer. And, for me, the biggest bummer was that J.K. Rowling didn't advance the romance between Ron and Hermione, which had been building nicely through the first four books. The fourth book, it seems, was long because it needed to be, while this one was long because the author wanted a hefty offering. It's just too bad she didn't have enough of a story to support its length."
3,Far from expectations,"As a Harry Potter fan, I can easily say that this book is far from expectations. Most of the great aspects which made Harry Potter series so famous are lost in this book. Starting with the ""Goblet of Fire"", J.K.Rowling started to repeat herself with every book. There are too many falshbacks to previous events in this book, and I believe this disgusts the reader after sometime. Nevertheless, this is sure a must have for every fan.3/5."
5,May be best Harry book,"My 3 favourite Harry books are Philosopher's Stone, Goblet Of Fire and this one. This could be the best.There's only 2 bad things about this album, 1 doesn't matter much but the other sure does. What's up with the beginning of the Harry Potter books? All of the first chapters are usually garbage (with the exception of philosopher's stone). This one has 10 chapters, that's like 200 pages of boringness. It's essential the first time, but you'll probably want to read it again! The second is, J. K. Rowling wanted to make this book longer than Goblet, so she added some filler at the end, I mean, the last chapter consists of Harry thinking the same stuff over and over, in his depression, duuuh. Anyway. This book is FABULOUS. As all other Harry Potter books, it will have you hooked! This book + The Rolling Stones/The Beatles playing make the best combination of all time."
4,The good parts,"The book ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix"" is a great book. The whole book is filled with intrigue and mystery, and the large number of smaller-font pages keep you guessing. Personally, I think the next Harry Potter book might be just as good as this one was-perhaps even better. The fact that the author has created so many spells for use in the book always keeps the reader guessing what Harry will do next. The mix of magic and adventure is a clever touch. I'm glad the author is applying herself, and that there will be more books like the other 5."
4,Another bridging book....,"As in book 4, this book has no real end of plot... just the end of the year. All it makes me want to do is get book 6!I liked the red Herrings that were rampant (as in, who is actually going to die) and I have a new favorite character in Luna Lovegood, the spacy, but wonderful ravenclaw."
2,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Review,"Rowling imposes the reader with a loose plot over-embellished with superfluous details. From the start, the reader is crushed with new characters and places, most of which are at best ancillary to the main story. During the reign of Umbridge, events descend into the incredulous, topped off by the voluntary departure-expulsion of certain characters from Hogwarts. The skillful, subtle style of the previous books has been replaced by an brusque and overt confrontational manner. Rather than allow the readers to draw their own conclusions from insidious hints, the author has chosen to give away the plot in whammies which create no lingering feelings after the intial shock. This book is a climax without a build-up. My final verdict: content suitable for ages 9 and up, style suitable for ages 8 and down."
4,Good read ...,"I enjoyed reading the first few Harry Potter's books and I couldn't wait to put my hand on the fifth. It's probably the best among all as the author spent more time developing the characters in the book, esp. Harry Potter and Sirius Black. For someone of my age, more than 25 years old, a pure fantasy book can't hold my attention for a long time. I consider this as a breakthrough for the author. 4 star b'cos I didn't like the ending, the fact that Sirius Black died and the other people didn't seem much affected by it except Harry Potter and Dumbledore. It seems the author spent so much time developing the character and at the end, just cast it aside without explaining much, maybe, she is planning his return?! A little bit more ""grief"" from other will make the ending a little bit more tolerable."
2,Harry Potter and the Order of The Bored,"This book wasn't horrible if you take it on its face...however if you include the previous four books, you'll begin to wonder how Harry changed his whole personality in the month that is supposed to have transpired between books 4 and 5.I am sorely disappointed, and Voldemort plotting for a year to get a Prophecy? Why was it called a weapon? The book was misleading in spots, plainly obvious in others, and Harry is not the Harry I knew from books 1-4.I think perhaps J.K. has been too busy selling movie rights to dedicate much time to the venue that got her started.I do hope she concentrates more on books 6 and 7, but rest assured I won't be standing in line at Borders when the next one comes out."
2,Where's the emotion?,"I, personally, was disappointed in this book. The first four grabbed me and made me care about the characters. This one left me not caring about most of them in the slightest. Even the death scene had no effect. The character of Harry came across as whiny, self-absorbed and complaining. Yes, I know that's typical for his age, but I'm not looking for reality in a Harry Potter book; I'm looking to escape reality. Everyone seemed so two-dimensional in this story. Hagrid, Dumbledore, the Dursleys, the Weasleys, everyone...they were all just paper dolls.I don't know. Maybe it's just me. I sincerely hope everyone else enjoys it more than I did."
3,Surprise,"From the first four books we were expecting much more from J.K. Rowling. We waited long months for the average novel. Harry was VERY annoying and stubborn, and seemed to have grown a skull as thick as the book's spine over the summer. Most of the trouble he had caused through this time was not to rescue others but to let out his own anger. Its a mystery how Harry remains Dumbledore's favorite. However I would like to congratulate the Rowling on the beginning and a few interesting moments."
5,J. K. Rowling manages to do it again!,"The fifth installment of her book was even better than the last one! It kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't put the book down. Even though it was almost 900 pages, I didn't want it to end, wishing that it was instead 9,000 pages!"
3,Ok but lacking,"Maybe it's the over anticipation of the book but I was disappointed. The story was good but it lacked the attention to detail of the earlier books. The book covered many events but many of the events were not covered in depth. In the past books events flowed and allowed me to understand where, why and when; but this time characters had to explain it to me. The past books were fun romps with a dark under current. This book was dark with very little fun in it. The only bit of fun was limited to the twins and I felt it was a bit forced. I think that Ms. Rowlings needs to bring a little fun back into the future books. I will read the book again to see if perhaps I missed something 1st time around - unfortunately I don't think I did."
4,IT'S A BRILLIANT BRIDGE,"Our family just finished today...I read the entire thing aloud--boy, am I hoarse! Major points (I guess...):The length was probably not altogether necessary...I think the first six chapters could easily have been condensed into three...Harry's teenage ""angst"" does get a little tedious unless you have purely ""parental"" patience with him and remember that the poor kid was tortured and severely traumatized in GOBLET--and even then you'd kinda like to give him a small shot to the head and an ""Aw, shut up."" at times.Rowling FINALLY hits her stride and much from the middle to the end of the book is typical of her superb ability to blend suspense, mystery, and uproarious humor--Fred and George steal the show this book.While it didn't steal my heart in the same way as the other books, It certainly kept me turning pages (even jumping ahead when no one was looking)and was a good ""bridge piece"" in the series that tied up some loose ends and advanced the plot."
5,Bloom,"It was a pretty intense book, in my opinion its as good as the goblet of fire yet more excitin, it good how you find the truth about many people like cho who is a complet oppsite of the impresion she gives you in the first few book, in conclusion it was a pretty good book."
3,Evil is back???,"To be totaly honest, I was rather disappointed. I just missed, the spellbinding, pageturning tension of the four previous books. Harry Potter being a blooming teenager is not very convincing. The plot is dragging, almost predictable, thera are to many sidelines and the conclusion not much of a suprise. Of course, Harry Potter and the other characters need to develop, THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX is about ignorance, trust and changes, but nobody seems to communicate or even care any more. The characters run in circles, their actions make no sense at all ,nevertheless, everything falls into places in the end.I can't say I did not enjoy reading this book, but I expected much more. There was not to much new stuff to discover, some things I was really looking forward to find out about."
5,She's Done It Again!!,"Congratulations, once again, to the incomparable JK Rowling. The same exciting, fast-paced, emotional reading as shown in her previous 4 books, with the wizarding world we've all come to know and love, including all our favourite characters.I particularly loved the older, typically teenage Harry, although he was hard to come to terms with at first, and I think that JK has epitomised the journey into adulthood with Harry's confusion and anger at his loss of both his previously simplistic view of the world and his innocence, in a manner that most of us adults who've gone through puberty, will be uncomfortably familiar with. I couldn't put it down! My one complaint - why can't she write faster?!!!Well done! I cannot recommend this, or any of the previous books in the series, highly enough to any age group. If you haven't been reading Harry Potter - where HAVE you been?"
1,J.K. Rowling sells out,"I believe that J.K. Rowling succumbed to the pressure of writing a fabulous 5th book by adding more violence, more anger, and unnecessary vulgarities and foul language. In the first couple of chapters the word `damn' is used repeatedly as well as the word `effing.' There is a discussion of someone's buttocks and I am sure the list goes on. I love the Harry Potter books but I don't think I would, in good conscience, let my children read this book. If Rowling wanted to start making the books where Harry is older darker and more like the 14 year old boy he is, then she should make her readers aware of it and let her younger readers know not to read it, which at this point, is like telling a child not to breathe."
3,ok...not what I anticipated,"The books are becoming very redundant...repeating almost the same plot, so Rowling had to do something!! Oh, hold me back Voldemort is coming to get me...it's always the same thing. Don't get me wrong, I loved the 1-4 books, but it just..never changes!!! She had to do something in the 4th book thats why she made the Dark Lord comeback...anyways..what would happen?? Besides I found Harry extremely annoying in this book. Always snapping at Ron and Hermione. For all the waiting that we had to do...it wasn't as great. But I am looking foward to see who Rowling is going to kill off to make the book a little more ""tragic""...sorry... these are supposed to be ""kid's novels"". Not for the young and the restless...."
5,Harry Potter,"I must say that this book is certainly one of my favourites, but I think that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is my number one. A lot of interesting things happen to Harry during his fifth year at Hogwarts and most of them are bad. I think it's really a good thing that Rowling has decided to give Harry more negative things to deal with because it keeps the plot interesting. She shows a more negative side to Harry as well, which makes it a lot more realistic (as realistic as a scarred wizard boy can be) for the audience. The book also leaves you with a lot of questions, which is definitely good for selling the 6th book in the series. I got it at midnight last night (June 21st) and stayed up until 4 am reading it. It's definitely a page turner and absolutely does not seem as long as it is."
2,J.K. Rowling has lost her touch,"What is wrong with this book....there are so many things to name. First off it is way too predictable and more of a recap of the series than then 5th addition to it. Second....this book was boring beyond belief. It was a struggle to keep reading. Three...Too much info involved. In her other novels of the series J.K. won the reader's hearts through witty turns with the words and her magical sense of being able to tie it together. This book lacks that and more. Harry potter yelling at everyone?! That is not typical teenage behavior. Get a life! I hope her next in the series are much better written than this. Oh yea. not to give anything away, but the ""surprise"" is a huge anti-climax."
2,Disappointed,"I have loved each of the Harry Potter books, feeling each was better than the previous book, until now. The 5th year is the only one I have found to be dark and unenjoyable. It was not a fun read like all the others have been. There was no humor. Many characters were uninvolved and the ending was unsatisfactory."
3,A bit stale,"I agree with some of the poor reviews, but giving it a single star is too harsh. There's still some fun stuff in here.A couple of problems I had with the book:* The characters (including the students) swearing -- it's mild stuff, and I know a ton of adults are reading this series, but let's not forget that it started as a kid's series and the tone should stay that way, even if the characters are growing up. There's no need to elevate to harsher language and it does nothing for the story.* It's just too long. Especially in the first half you can feel her stretching out the story for no reason. Seems that she (or the publisher) is afraid to pull back and offer a great 300-400 page read now that the bar on the page count has been set so high. Does this mean we're pushing over 1000 pages by volume 7?"
3,Plot Problems,"It pains me to give a HP book only 3 stars but I can't get past what I see as plot problems with the book. These problems all center around Harry forgetting the item Sirius gave him and told him to use if he needed it. How could Harry have forgotten that and gone to such dangerous lengths to talk Sirius? twice?? The only reason for him to ""forget"" was to push the plot in the direction it ended up in. I don't buy that Harry pushed it out of his mind because he wanted to protect Sirius, I don't buy that Sirius didn't remind Harry about the mirror when he talked to him using Umbridge's office, and if it was such a danger why didn't someone?? (didn't have to be Dumbledore) warn Harry that Voldemort could be using their connection to fool Harry and put him in danger???"
4,"JK Rowling, why more pages, WHY?","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoniex is a pretty good read. I thought that it wouldn't have more pages than the other Harry Potter books, though. I thought that who died in the book was a little bit to easy to predict. This book is one of the better Potter books, but none of the Potter books are as good as the 3rd one. Overall, a good book, but I sure hope Rowling doesn't decide to make the 6th one longer."
4,Well...,"The Harry Potter books are definitely all near or at the top of my all-time favorites list, and I think that J.K. Rowling is a great and descriptive author and can get into her ""character's skins"" really well.Having said that, I have to say that the new Harry Potter book seemed to be not quite as great as the last four. It seemed a lot darker than the other books- Harry seemed like some disturbed teenage maniac and was furious for the entire duration of the book; I don't think that any teenager could be that furious.This book is just so dark... and not in the dramatic way. More than less in the twisted way... I still say that it was descriptive and better than a lot of books that I have read, just not as happy or... intricately woven... as the others."
3,"Long, slow, and disappointing.","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is easily the weakest of the seven books. The tome is quite long, and yet when I reached the halfway point my thought was, ""nothing's happened yet."" The whole story just drags, and in the end it isn't much fun. Were this the first Harry Potter book that I'd read, I don't think I would have bothered to read any others."
5,Another great story from JK Rowling,The Harry Potter books have been great so far that is why they have such a following. There isnt much else to say except Another great story :)
5,Order of the Phoenix - Meatiest Potter Book YET!,"I couldn't put the darn book down!The development of characters in this latest edition makes ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" a virtual feast. We are introduced to new aspects of each character, and the developing story line certainly doesn't disappoint the imagination.J.K. Rowling should be named ""Minister of Imagination""!Thanks for the treat..."
5,"superb! hem, hem","i waited for the book since i finished my Goblet of Fire. As soon as i can get hold of it (that was on 21st) i finished it within 7 hrs. 766 pages, and i'm reading it for the fifth time, afraid of losing anything.this one is the best yet, the darkest, and full of promises for another two years of Hogwarts."
3,Should have been shorter,"I recognize Rowling is writing each book at a higher and more sophisticated reading level (which includes length), but Order is unnecessarily long. One of her gifts in earlier books was to communicate a lot in few words. However (as in ""Goblet""), there is *too much* going on and this could have been trimmed to 2/3 its current length with some disciplined writing and good editor.A good story, but it did not need 600+ pages to tell it."
4,"Great, even though it's long!","I have to admit that this was the first Harry Potter book I was extremely frusterated with, as nothing seems to be going right for Harry, but of course in the end everything (well almost everything) turns out ok. I got the book at 1pm in the mail, and had it read by 6pm. I couldn't put it down! I had to find out what happened! I would definitely say that this series has proved to be better for adults than children, though, as the plots thicken the the world around Harry Potter deepens. It was nice to see just a hint of romance too!"
5,Awesome,I am behind on reading these books and this one did not disappoint. Cannot wait to read the next one but dread the ever closer end to the series!
5,Harry Potter #5,"Yes this book is long but the author has a lot of history she has to cover. It explains a lot about the relationship of Harry and Voldemort. It answered a lot of questions about Harry's past and why Voldemort was so intent on killing him. Plus it introduced more of Snapes charter, the relationship he had with James Potter, Lupin and Sirius along with rest of the Order of the Phoenix. J.K. Rowling keeps you on the edge of your seat. I liked it and have read it several times and still come up with more info. Can't wait until #6."
5,this book is great,"when you start to read this book it my be a slow start in the first chapter but you better stick to it and finish.In my opinoyn the best book of J.K rowlings books is the harry potter and the order of the phinix.In this book it give alot of detail, and with the arivle of there new defence aganst the dark arts teacher the school gets turned upsid down.the best part of this bookis most likely the second to last chapter i dont want to give away any of the dedail but the end is really informitive. This book has magical spellbining words and trumedicle dedail no matter what it is still harry potter!"
3,Order of the Phoenix,The first four where good but I'm afraid this one is boring. I think it will not hold young childrens attention and will not make a good movie
3,Not the best,"J.K. Rowling has gotten her writing back. It is much crisper and funnier than in Book 4. However, it is a lot like the movie The Empire Strikes Back. Short on plot and more of a bridge between the previous entry in the series and the next. With the earlier books I couldn't wait to finish them because it was exciting and I wanted to see how things turned out. Not so with this once because I knew the real story would be in Book 6."
5,Rowling does it again.,"These books engage me. They are morality tales for our age and yet remain hugely entertaining. This fifth installment does not fail to reel in the reader's mind and heart on a variety of levels. In the end, it is not about wizards and magic, but about the very hard decisions we all make (or don't make) in life. Rowling has done a great service to us all."
3,"Ok, for the Harry Potter series",The pace was much slower in this book and the new headmaster's act got tired and boring as the book went on. Can't believe who they killed off. That was my favorite character.
5,Harry Potter was awesome!!!,I really liked this book because of all the twists and suspense. It had a great plot and showed how the students at Hogwarts and Harry coped and reacted to the events that they were faced with. This book was great and I'm looking forward to the sixth book of Harry Potter! I hope the sixth book will be as great as the others! I also hope that the sixth book will be coming out soon because the suspense of what will happen next is unbearable!
5,Cracking Good Yarn,"This is a must read for fans of teen wizard Harry Potter. The mystery in this book lasts right through to the end and has quite a few suprises. Once again, J.K. Rowling has woven new adventures, dangers, and even a few moments of teenage romance, for the Wizard Harry Potter. Her writing of Harry's story is well paced over the whole book, and you won't want to put it down. All the new characters are well fleshed out and made as real as those you have seen on the screen. With all the ridiculous rumors about who dies and other things in the story, you will find yourselves not seeing most of them in the book. The ending of the book has been well designed to make you want to see the saga through to the conclusion in the last 2 books. This books answers a lot of questions just hinted at in the previous books and there are plenty of heroes to go around in this book."
2,"J.K., where are you?","I was VERY disappointed and, based upon my discussions with others, I'm not alone. I can honestly say that I didn't begin to even partially enjoy this book until the last 200 or so pages, always waiting for that UMPH. The writing seemed to have changed - less geared to children, and the tone was far more depressing, sometimes leaving me anxious. Although life in reality does have its ups and downs, Book 5 makes Harry's life seem almost suicidal.I was left with the feeling that J.K. is either bored, has lost interest, or would rather move on to other things. I still look forward to the two remaining books; but, let's hope they are more in line with the tone of the first 4 and, for goodness sakes, please give Harry some semblance of optimism!"
1,harry potter whines in 870 pages,"Wow, I waited two years for this book? Poorly written, badly edited, long, boring and disjointed. Rowling has never been a friend or known a teenage boy in her life. She needs to do some research. It sounded as she did not want to write this book but was forced into doing it. It needs tightning up a great deal. The characters are flat, they run in and out of the story without any continuity. You wonder who wrote the first four this one is so bad. From Hagrid ghosting n and out with a large contrived brother that is there only for a loose end later. I could go on, but will not waste any more time on this book."
3,Good but a little disappointing,"I brought the book the Monday after it came out and finished by Friday, but I was a little upset because Harry seems like a spoiled brat through most of the book and I was really upset by who was killed. I mean can the kid get a break.I was also mad when certain people left school. I reality (hehehehe) they would have been sent right back to school no matter what. I did like the idea of the DA and the order and all."
5,Wonderful and Thrilling,"This book exceeds the forth as Harry battles, conquers, and deals with many problems in his life. The reader gets more answers and explanations to Harry's past and future. This book definately sets the tone for the second war against Lord Voldemort. By the end of the book, Harry has been transformed into a different person with different values . A veil is now between him and the rest of his Hogwart friends. I loved the book adn can't wait until the next is published!"
1,Disenchanting Magic,"For a series as stunning as the Harry Potter series, the fifth installment seems to be J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The charm of the first four novels is not evident within a boring, disenchanting first chapter. Rowling's flow seems off, and unfortunately, this was the doomsday for this book. After a long wait for this book, the first chapter wasn't worth the wait. The book isn't worth my time."
5,"Very good, and not for children only","While not quite as good (IMO) as Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix is an excellant book. The ""object of desire"" is a little bit of a ""so what"" thing, but the story moves along well and keeps one entertained. Harry is growing up and is starting to discover things other than Quidditch, and he is in sort of a foul mood in much of the story.JK Rowling is sort of cruel with the reader with her ""a major character dies"" comment and how she plays with that theme (OK, I am trying to be very careful in wording so I don't give anything away).All in all, very good for both children (like my 12 year old daughter who loves it) and adults (like me - I paid for it, I got to read it first <g>)"
5,The Best Book Yet.... Again,"When I got this book, I didn't know whether to read it all in a few days, or space it out over the following week. Whatever way you read it though, you will love this book. Although this book is definatly the saddest one so far, and Harry can't seem to control his temper (which results in a pretty unexpected relationship which Cho), the plot I think is the best yet. We are introduced to a whole new bunch of characters, including Luna Lovegood and Tonks. We also get to meat Neville's mom and grandma, as well as (suprise!) Gilderoy Lockheart, who I can't decide whether he's improved or not. There are also things in the book which can be very annoying at times, such as the stupidity of Dolores Umbridge, but it is all part of a fantastic story which never stops providing first class entertainment. You will find your self eagerly turning the next page..."
3,Very. Random.,"I'm not going to go into it /all/, but the entire book was unecessarily random and long. Things happened for absolutely no reason, which was very unlike JK. I enjoyed the book, like all the others, but some of the characters started to get very irritating. Harry became /incredibly/ whiny and angsty, and he took any of his frustration out on his ever-loyal friends, who just took it.This book was funnier, in spots, than the others, but it was also longer and really depressing. It teared on ""the government"" a lot, which I have no issue with, but others may.Overall, it was a 4.5 stars, but, in comparision to the rest of the series, only a 3."
3,It was ok I guess..........,I'm a BIG Harry Potter fan who especially liked the Goblet of Fire so when it came out I bought it immediately. the book did not meet up to my expectations. It was just SO long and SO descriptive they have pages and pages about the same thing. He doesn't even get to Hogwarts until a few chapters.
1,Couldn't get past the 1st page,too boring. unbelievable!!! the fourth book was boring too. the only one I really liked was the first. now harry potter is a mindless idiot. lying on a flower bed? come on.
2,Malfuntioning Washing Machine!,"Oh duh! Harry the hero now becomes Harry the spoilt brat! And I'd compare J.K. Rowling to a malfuntioning washing machiine, because all the colours of this ""piece of clothing"" totally comes off! And Harry Potter thinks he's the greatest one all around, and goes sulking, screaming, and crying because he arrived two weeks late to the Order of the Phoenix HQ. He's supposed to be 15 years old, but he acts like as if he is a 15-month-old baby! He doesn't accept ANY opinion, and distrusts even his closest friend. What's he good at, besides Quidditch? Any problem, from Devil's Snare to homework, it's either Ron or Hermione! He didn't even know WHAT is magic is and now he thinks he's an expert on it. Sorry, but can someone fix the washing machine or just throw it into the dump?"
1,Who else is ordering a paper copy because Pottermore/Prime is a pain?,I'm ordering a paper copy of this book for my son exclusively because ordering through Pottermore or being forced to sign up for Prime is too big of a pain.
1,Tripe!,"Just like the four that went before, this is talentless hack writing at it's very worst. A triumph of marketing spin over ability and imagination. Potter is plagiaristic, plotless, claptrap. Poor grammar and syntax just put the finishing touches to yet another Rowling volume that should never have been published. If you (and your kids) want to read something genuinely original, stimulating and beautifully written; pick up anything by Phillip Pulman (esp. His Dark Materials trilogy)."
5,"My favorite book of the series, now i have it in two editions!","This is my favorite book out of all 7, and I have the American version. I am happy to be able to own the British edition as well. It got here in good time and in good conditiion for being used. In my opinion used books are loved books. I would buy from them again."
4,not great but really good,Harry Potter v was not the best of the series but i really enjoyed it. this book answeard all of the questions that we have been wondering from the beggining of the series. there was great mystery surrounding Sirius's Childhood and other members of his family. there was also a big surprise between the weaslys and the malfoys. this book also brought around the Characture Proffeser Umbridge who at times evoked a very angry emotion. one thing though i think could have been left out was a couple chapters concerning Hagrid and yet another bad decision concerning his obbsesion with out of the rather out of the ordinary animals overall this book is pretty good and i felt there could have been a bit more action but overall it was very nice.
5,HARRY POTTER ROCKS!!!!,"i finished the book in one day. all 766 pages of it!!! i was so hooked and the plot is so complex that it kept me on my toes the whole way through. since i'm a teenager i can really understand what he's feeling and why he's in such a temper most of the time. this book really made harry potter seem more real and tangible than the other 4 books. it shows tha he's got a temper and that he is not always so perfect. though, in the end i was a bit disappointed that harry was less heroic and he didn't get to have his revenge on Bellatrix Lestrange. the death of one of the characters made me sad and weepy. i wished that JK Rowling didn't include it in the story though.i guess that in the 6th book harry may have his revenge on the Lestrange woman. GRRRR....i really hate her (bellatrix lestrange, i mean)I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK IN THE POTTER SERIES!!!!"
5,A very good book.,"I have read all of the Harry Potter books and while i do not think that this is the best it is one of the best. The characters change and grow in this book more than the others and many favorite characters from past books return. The villians are also great you hate them with every fiber of your bieng. Harry deals with much in this book love, hate, pain, and death. i highly recommend this book i read it in two days and it gives me a strong inclination to go back and read the earlier books again. But more than anything it makes you crave the next book like a fat kid wants candy."
5,Best of them All!,"This was another wonderful book from J.K. Rowling. Absolutley great! There were many new charaters, new dimentions to the story, as well as TONS of new information, with explinations for many things from earlier books. Also, the best thing about this book, was the ending! Many of the books have a rather sad ending, but this one really gave the reader a bright outlook for the reader. It was really great, even with the character death.One of the bad things about this book, is J.K.'s EVIL sense of humor. She came out early telling everyone that there would be a character death, then in the course of the book, had just about ever character ALMOST die, or disappear, and get the readers very worried, then let them be okay. This got really old, and almost lesened the importance of the real character's death. But other then that, the book was perfect.GREAT READ!!"
5,If you are a TRUE fan...,"If you are a TRUE Harry Potter fan, you shouldn't even be here reading this review. Because if you love Harry Potter as much as I do, you'll know that this book is worth it. I went out at midnight to get this book, and waited 3 hours for it. But, you know what?? I don't regret it. This book is awesome, and I think they are gonna get better and better as they go.So, TRUE fans who don't own this book, don't read reviews to see if it's good enough to buy or not. Just BUY IT."
3,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"It's sorry to say that the much awaited book of the series is very dull.It is terrible literature.The main point is it lacks the exitement which is found in the other books.The content also shows that Harry is in his adulthood.There is nothing childish in this book.Harry looks pretty angry in this book.No one beleives him,nobody trusts him.I like the beginning pretty much,but the Cho Chang thing makes it dull.Also,Harry does not get to do anything just and only by himself.Overall,it is fun to read but it is not super.Ihope the next book is much better."
3,"abracadabra, rub-a-dub-dub, open sesame","Mmm. I get the funny feeling that the books are getting bigger and bigger (whats the spell for that - I think Alice in Wonderland had a potion for it) but that bigger is not better. Oh well. These books get the youngsters reading and talking about them and in these TV days that has to be a Good Thing. Harry is in one Bad Mood, and when I say Bad I mean not good. Harry shouts, he strops, he gets his hair off, he wears his jumper inside out just to be a rebel. I think that Dursley kid is under-rated. He gets a bad break, just cos' he a bit large for his age, he'll grow into his skin I reckon. He manages to show a bit of maturity and organisation, at least he has mates. If he manages to catch HP a good clip round the ear I'm sure it would improve him no end. Don't forget Harry is still not allowed to use magic outa school. Attaboy Duds, don't let 'em put you down."
4,?????,I think the book was awesome. everything fit together perfectly but the end was horrible. Harry has been through so much already and cant go through the death of the only person he had left. The only person that has been like a father to him and i dont think that he should have died!
5,JK rowling has ...,...the book starts kind of slow with a lot of character development. But it really picks up and the last half of the book flies by leaving you wanting more as always. I can't wait for the next one. I read the book in three days and couldn't put it down. Rowlings ability to create an immersive experience is amazing.
5,Absolutely Amazing,"I think ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a great addition to the Harry Potter series. Although it is not my favorite book in the series, it still blew me away. I loved how the plot became darker and more mysterious and creative as the story progressed. The thing i enjoyed the most, however, was the fact that they hardly changed anything from the British to the American version. I loved the British slang and expressions in the book, it added more authenticity and character to it. I personally thought this book was awesome, a must read for anyone. Oh, and for all those who say it's too long, what are you talking about? That's the best part, I never wanted it to end!"
3,These kids never learn!,"This one isn't my favorite, but once it got rolling I enjoyed it. The first half of the book could have been pared down a tad - found it tedious, and found myself getting irritated with Mr. Potter's teenaged petulance... it felt overdone - there could have been less and the point still would have been made. As with the other books, loved the details and the some of the side stories - these are the elements that keep this book together. Once things start to roll in the book I liked it - although it's essentially the same story as the others - these kids just don't seem to learn from experience! (Something I'm going to have trouble swallowing in the next installment.) Glad to have read this - but if the next one is like this one, getting through it is going to seem like work."
3,Disappointing,"This book has two major problems: 1) It's too long. 2) The ending is anti-climactic. That doesn't bode well, especially when we've all waited so long for this latest Harry Potter installment. This is my least favorite book of them all. It's long and drawn out, and although there is major suspense leading to the end, it doesn't lead to much.I'm giving it three stars because it is still entertaining. I was only bored at the very beginning. After the first 10 chapters or so, things get quite interesting. There is a lot of suspense, there are funny parts, and other things that you expect to find in a Harry Potter book. But overall, it is not up to par with the other books in the series. I hope Book 6 will meet my expectations better."
5,Harry Potter twist in the end,This book like all harry potter books is great and amazing. You feel as if your standing there next to harry potter and hermione and ron on their great adventures. We all know harry potter has always had a great twist in the end. as in this one was what dumbledore said to harry. The shock that such an important character close to harry dies ( not mentioning who) harry is conected to his past more then ever. this book not to mention has raging hormones between fellow hogwarts students. A new defense against the dark arts teacher is there as well. Its all great. i reccomend it. as well as all the others. for harry potter lovers out there we all know this as a great book.
5,Book 6 please!,"Another adventure at Hogwarts is over and I can't wait until the next one. Order of the Pheonix (O.F.) seems to encompass everything that the Harry Potter books are supposed to be about...mystery, magic, friends, and growing up. More than the other books, O.F. brings us into the mind of a 15 year old boy and allows us to experience all the emotional termoil that comes with it. Overall this book might be more difficult to read for someone who is new to the Potter series, but if thats the case then starting at Book 1 will definately be worth the effort."
2,we waited for this?,"We've been waiting nearly three years for this installment of the Harry Potter series and, after reading all 870 pages, it hardly felt worth the wait. For instead of the fun, magical world that Rowling has given to us in previous books, this one feels stale and lacks the fluidity of it's predecessors. It is entirely too long and could have easily been trimmed to keep the pace livelier and entertaining. It does drag in places and hardly feels like the Scooby-gang mysteries the other books have treated us to. Bring back the magic J.K.!"
5,It was great!,"I read the Harry Potter book in less than 2 days. I could not put this book down. I think that this is the best book J.K. Rowling has ever made of the harry Potter series. The begining was even good! The book is about Harry who has had an awful but interesting summer and has to move into this dank old house concealed from muggles and live with a very weird house elf and his godfather who must not leave the house for protection. And there Harry finds out that the daily prophet has been talking rubbish about him. When he returns to Hogwarts, there is a new teacher who looks very much like a toad and is very horrible. But I must warn you that the end is not very good. A very important character dies. Someone very close to Harry. But I am not going to tell you so read the book and I am sure that you will agree that this is the best of the Harry Potter series."
4,What is Harry's problem?,"It was really difficult for me to get through the first seven chapters...wait, did I say seven? Harry really surprised me when he turned out sniveling, whiney and just plain annoying throughout most of the book (although he does get better towards the end). He obviously does not understand the concepts of accepting responsibility, humility or even loyalty.The writing is superb, as always, and definitely an easy read. I was on the edge of my seat for alot of the book, but I was incredibly disappointed in Harry. (Plus at Ron and Herminone too for not giving him a huge sock when he most deservedly needed one!)As a whole, I really enjoyed the book and explained away Harry's arrogance and attitude as teenage angst/puberty. Hopefully he becomes a man and grows up a bit in the next two books."
4,Excellent Story Runs a Little Long,"An excellent addition to the series. It truly is packed with plot, but a little slow in parts. Still, I didn't want to put it down and read it in a day and a half. Ms. Rowling is very gifted."
4,Disappointed in Dallas (4.5 stars),"I'm somewhat disappointed in book #5. I like the plot(s) and the characters and the ending, but the book has too much...""filler""? in it. This book should have been 500 pages long, and it would have been a classic. As it is, it's a good book that has too much ""filler"" in it.Yes, I'd read it again, but it was NOT a book I couldn't put down. The ""filler"" material made it slower than her first 3 and reminded me of #4. The ending is great."
3,very slow in th beggining...,I have always been a fan on the Harry potter books and was thrilled when this one FINALLY came out. However unlike the other 4 books this one started out very slowly. Rowling did a good job of portraying a 15 year old boy but even so harry was starting to get on my nerves. Buy yhe end of the book I was almost rooting for voldemort. The next book could be called harry potter's friends and the......
1,A waste of time!,"I just cannot enjoy this book at all. It is poorly written and the charactures are boring. This book also seems to see rebellion as a good thing. Pathetic. If your looking for a good book, read Lord of the Rings. Do not waste your time reading this book,or any of the Harry Potter books. Like I said, these books are just plain pathetic. Why are they so popular? I know! Because people do not know what good literature is."
1,Thank you,Great book I really enjoyed reading this book I am defiantly going to buy and look forward to the next bookHarry potter ROCKS!!!!!!
3,Not so great,"Let's not forget, this is a kid's book. I have to make some exceptions, obviously because of that. I can't say it sucks because there is no imagery or ""intelligence"" like books by authors such as George Orwell and Aldous Huxley. What I can do is judge the flow of the story. A story should flow nicely.Harry Potter is a good series, but this one just doesn't feel right. The beginning is very slow, and detailed, when the ending is somewhat quick and dropped. Basically, you read the book just for the conversation between Harry and Dumbledore, and the rest seem useless by the time you finish it. I suppose there are way too many kids that will disagree with me, but what I said about the flow of the story is very evident."
1,Lacks Substance!!,"I consider myself a fan of Harry Potter, and being a Mom of teenager's who rarely read, managed to turn both my teens into Harry readers. All three of us said the same thing about this book....""This book isn't going anywhere"" The other four Harry Potter books were much more superior. There were no ""Harry Adventures"", the characters were poor, and very frequently felt that issues in the book were not resolved. I purchased all the Harry Potter books, but got this one from the Library....luckily I didn't spend the money"
3,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"The product was listed as being in very good condition, but when it came it looked as if it had been tightly banded in three spots around the hardbound cover to the point of indentations in three spots both on the top and the bottom. I sent an email to the seller and asked that they ship me a replacement copy, but have never had that request responded to. Very disappointing. My son wanted the Harry Potter series for a collection, and now he has one book out of the whole series that is in less than hoped for condition."
3,...,"Don't ask me why, after reading the series, I guess I just grew bored.Each has a good plot and worked out story but grows boring as time grows on. If you're a first time reader, it will be captivating, inventive and wonderful but for me, as each book progesses, I grow a little more bored.I don't understand either."
3,this book was ok,"i think this book was the best out of all the other harry potter books.it was more exciting and had more action, but i would rather read the lord of the rings series (and the hobbit)or the deltora Quest series"
4,A good book,"This book is cool. The it is very interesting,my favorit part is the fight with a big snake. It's not based on real history, It's a fitcion history. His enemy is Voldemort, your finish batle is with Voldemort."
5,A Must read for all Harry Potter Fans!!,"I was just intraduced to the Harry Potter books a few Months ago! I read all 4 years and just finished Year 5! I think That J.K. Rowling is a very good Author and has a good thing going with these books! The Order of the Phenix started out good and held me in a trans to fallow through! Harry is now starting to deal with Growing into a teen and having to deal with the pressures of going up as a teen! With the struggle of adults not understanding him and the struggle of trying to understand girls, This book has it down on how it is for most teens growing up into Adults! I loved this book and can not wait for the next ones! I hope to also see more Movies come out of these books!"
3,Depressing and Slow,"Don't get me wrong. I'm an avid Harry Potter fan. Loved the first 3 books, tolerated the violence of the 4th, but disliked this 5th book intensely. It's as if the publishers no longer believe Rowling needs any editing. The first 3rd of the book could be condensed into a single chapter to keep it from dragging. The rest of the book desperately needs some light-hearted stress relief now and then. Overall, the story is incredibly depressing right till the end! I hope children reading this overly large and lumbering tome don't end up feeling hopeless and irritable. This is definitely not Rowling's best work; she seems to have lost touch with the magical and delightful nature with which she imbued the first 3 books in the series."
4,It's getting dark...,"Seemed a little slow on the uptake, but picked up nicely towards the middle. Several surprising reactions from established characters kept throwing me off.But, all-in-all, I'm pleased with the book, and of course, now I'm anxiously awaiting the next installment!!"
5,the first harry potter for real people,"This book is amazingly complex and cunningly performed by JK Rowling. The main difference between this and the first four books in the harry potter series is that it gives harry the true identity of a person his age. Unlike the first four it has Harry questioning how people around him do things verbally, being quite irratable when things don't seem to be going the way they should, and resenting others for leaving him out. This gives Harry the extra dimensions he lacked in the previous novels and helps people feel like they can relate. This book also is more complex in storyline and more mysterious (if you'll believe that) then the first four. Its a modern classic and deserves to be standard reading in schools."
4,This book is great,This book on the whole is great. Albeit Harry throws too many fits and it is a tad too long but it does not spoil the over all magic quality of the book. Anyone else who enjoyed this book should go here: http://www.outwar.com/page.php?x=1719175 it has some great stuff
4,Book Review for Tech High,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a great book, but with some let down to it. J.K. Rowling's didn't stop the action in the Order of the Phoenix. Harry is attacked from the beginning at from there is story runs and runs the whole book. Myself I read it in about a week in my spare time. I found myself sitting reading till very late in the night. The plot gets very thick and is extremely interesting. You see the difference in their maturity and attitudes since the others. J.K. Rowling's did an awesome job on showing the changes of puberty and the maturity of getting older. Many things happen in this book that grabs your attention and leads you right to the next dilemma. This book will leave a satisfying bitter taste in your mouth."
3,An Angry harry?,"Over all I enjoyed this book. I have read all 5 of them now to my children. I read each one of them first, then to the kids. I get more detail in the second reading. All the Harry Potter books are well written. This one seems to be full of teen anger. Harry is mad at one thing or another thru the whole book. The end seems to just ""drop off"" like JK Rowling was not sure how to end it so she just put him back on the train home. I look forward to number 6, but hope Harry is less angy. Over all a good and fun read."
2,Worst of the Series By Far,"OotP was definitely a dissapointment compared to the rest of this wonderful series. Although it began to piece together some of the many questions the previous books introduced, the many chapters it took to get to those answers was a little painful. Harry's new teenage attitude is hard to deal with, the romance is fairly shallow, Hagrid is dumber than he usually is, and the new teacher at Hogwarts is more annoying than anything. Do read it to fill in the blank pieces of information regarding Harry, but chances are you won't find it as enjoyable as the other books."
3,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"I was disappointed in this installment. I found Harry terribly unlikeable for the first 200 pages and am glad that I already loved him from his previous books or I wouldn't have bothered continuing. He has grown into full-blown adolescence and is quite surly. I hope for less darkness in Rowling's last two novels in the series, which could be possible as she said that she didn't relish the pressure she had to write under to meet what she calls unreasonable editorial deadlines. Maybe the new baby will lighten her up."
2,Rowling Needs to be Held to a Schedule,"There are moments of brilliance and half hours of tedium; you can tell when the author just wasn't in the mood to write. The writing was more taut, suspense-filled, and funny when the author was a struggling single parent. Harry's anger can be explained, but gee, he isn't even close to being a scholar; he seems rather stupid sometimes. Ron has virtually no character at all, and Hermione is a first rate whiner. Its hard to admit, but the evil Dolores Umbridge has the most well-written character in the book. The publisher(s)/editor(s) need to get and keep the author on course and interested. Otherwise no one will much care if there IS a book 6 or 7."
2,The worst in the series,"I'm an adult fan and I can honestly say this book was a big disappointment. It seemed to just go absolutely no where for the long. You thought she must be building up to something great and the climax was so anti-climatic I felt so let down. This book did not need to be 766 pages long, it could have been wrapped up and been more exciting and suspenseful in about 500 or so. I'll read books 6 & 7 when they come out but I won't be reading 5 again that's for sure."
1,Terrible Book!!!,"By the end of the book, you won't really care what happens to Mr. Harry Potter. He's not the same Harry as we know from the other books, instead, we have to read about a snappy little smart mouth who has no reguards for people's feelings. But the author says that that's ok because Harry is a teenager and teenagers ARE SUPPOSED to act like that. This book sends a terrible message to any youth who reads it, suggesting that it's ok to be a pompous little twit, because that's how teenagers like Harry Potter are supposed to act! Cry me a river Harry!!!"
4,not a bad book,"Harry potter is a series that is enjoyable for all kinds and all ages of people. This new book, Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix (book 5) is not the BEST book around that you can read. I liked all the books and movies dealing with Harry Potter (the fictional wizard), but the only thing wrong is that the series is too childish. For example, Ron and Hermione argues too much in prisoner of azkaban and all of the other series. In addition, Harry, probably the best wizard of his kind, is a show-off (kind of anyways), and he always gets to deafeat the bad guys, and that's wrong, all the other people in the books are supposed to help! Moreover, the book has some cool action of magic charms and spells, plus some really cool and nice organizations from the D.A (Dumbaldore's Army) to the Order of the Phoenix. In other words, you should read this book, :)"
4,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,I thought that J.K. Rowling could have made Sirius's death more dramatic because he just fell behind a veil there for he was dead. Other than that I loved the book but she could have made Harry a little less whiny then he was but I liked the other books a lot better.
3,not the best,"This book is a good one but not great, it explains lots of things that were there wandering. But compaired to the past 4 its long and boring, Harry is bitter all the time and there is not much action, hope the next one is better."
5,I Cried,"I loved this book. I read this book in eight days. J.K leads me to a world that I wish I could be apart of. She take me back to being a kid myself. Yes, the book is long but while you are reading it you don't realize how long. I cried so hard at the end. I was like ""why, why?"" I won't say any more for people who haven't read it. All I can say is, I can't wait until book 6."
3,not at all what i expected,"this book was overall disappointing. Its obvious Rowling is trying to just buy time. By book 4 the antagonist had reached his full power and there was still 3 books to go. SO this book, all 870 pages are there to buy time, instead of a battle between the good and the evil we are met with a battle between good and the good.However, as disapointing as this book was, it is still a good idea to read it in order to understand the future books."
4,Not the best yet... Still a great book worth reading.,"I have read each of the previous four novels in this series numerous times. Each book I enjoyed more the previous. I just did not enjoy this novel nearly as much as the other four. This book simply lacked the adventure and action that Rowling has brought us to expect. This book does a great deal of explaining about Harry himself and his family. It gives a great deal of detail about characters that makes you wait for a big ending that never comes. This book also makes sudden changes to key characters. These changes just occur at the beginning of the book with no explanation. I also, however, see the genious in this book. This novel sacrificed a little of itself to make the next two novels amazing. The sixth and seventh years that Harry spends at Hogwarts will require minimal explanations. The Prophesy foreshadows an ending in the final book that no Harry Potter fan will soon forget. Thank you J.K. Rowling."
5,Second Best,"First best is the Prisoner of Azkaban, but - the Order of the Pheonix was a very interesting read. I laughed, I cried, I got bored, I near had anxiety attacks when i was almost finished with the book thinking 'what am i going to read in the next three years?' Hopefully, it won't take Joanne Rowling so long this time with the sixth. I liked it very much, if your an obsessed Harry Potter Fanatic like me though, anything Harry Potter is beyong brilliant, it's God!"
5,She's done it again...,"Well folks, we didn't think it was possible, but she's done it again. A few day prior to the release of the book, I thought, what is the point of reading this sequel if it can't possibly be better than the one before it. Obviously though, now that I've read it I must report that ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix"" has proved even better than the last four. Rowling's fabulous writing style and rich plot kept me glued to the pages and my mother shouting ""Stop reading, time for bed!!"""
3,"Good book, but too long","This was a good book, but my least favorite. The book is 870 pages, so it took a long time to read."
5,Fun Book,I am reading this entire series out loud to my kids. They cant wait til I get home so I can read.
4,"Despite A Very Pissed Off Harry, I Really Like This Novel...","Although understandable, it wasn't pleasant reading angry Harrry. But his teaching the D.A., fighting Death Eaters, and repelling Voldemort's possession make up for it. My second favorite character, Luna, gets introduced here, and doubts surrounding Harry's (and Dumbledore's) claims about Voldemort within the wizarding world and the turnaround with the publication of the Quibbler article intrigue me."
1,"This book is predictable, lame, boring, and implausible","Before I start, I must say that I had enjoyed books 1-4 and I have read each one of those books multiple times, but book 5, HP and the Order of Phoenix is different. I read it once, and I don't plan to ever read it again. It was one of the worst books I have ever read. Of the 870 pages in this book, maybe 100 of them were interesting. The rest was continuing repetition of stuff she had said many times before. The plot was predictable and implausible. Characters were one-dimensional and weak. They basically repeated the same exact things they had said before. This book was obviously not ready for print. She should have taken few more years and put out something readable. I have lost all respect for this author."
3,Not as good as books 3 & 4,"The story line was not up to par in comparison of her past work. I think she took to much time off in between books this time. The temporary new character to the book was more boring for me. I felt all the regular characters were not being utilitzed throughout the book, especially Dumbeldore. I also was looking for more info on Voldemort. The best part was the last 2 chapters. The rest of the book was more fluff then substance. Hopefully the next two books will be more on par with the 1st four."
3,Heavy on the hormones,"As a mother of a boy Harry's age, I am well aware of teenage anger and angst. I didn't really appreciate having to read about it for almost 800 pages. I love the Harry Potter series for it's adventure, intrigue, fun, and originality. I have to wonder if the book's dark nature isn't a reflection of the author's feelings toward the pressure she must now be facing. It doesn't seem like it's fun for her to write anymore. Other than that, the book had some wonderful and imaginative passages, and I look forward to the next installment."
4,"Good, but overly long, no spoilers...","A good book, nice continuation of the HP series. Interesting twists and turns in the plot and development of the characters. I enjoyed reading it, but it seems that the books could have used a little tighter editing. Just seems that at almost 900 pages that some parts of the book could have been left out since they didn't do much to forward the plot (of this book, could be used for future books) but just added page count."
3,Not original,I read this book over the weekend and its not that good. Firts 4 books of Harry Potter are much better. I was dissapointed when I read it since I waited in the Barns and Nobals for 5 hours. The book is like 3 pounds. Harry Potter just turned 15 and I'm not going to spoil the ending for the Potter fans who are going to read this book but one of the main charactors dies. I gave this book 3 stars.
1,whats with all the hype?,"jk rowling has sold out! tthe first one was ok, second one, meh, third one, uhhhhh, fourth one, 900 pages!? what are they gonna do 4 the movie! fifth one, AGH thats allPS-the movies r gonna catch up to the books and eventually daniel radcliffe will be too old!"
3,Its not my favorite Potter book.,"I was reading this and all of a sudden, I realized why it was so bad. I hated the darkness to it. It had much of a darker magic kind of story. I did like, however, the fact that Harry was growing up and his magic was really going to become more stronger to defeat Voldemort. You should check out the first 4 books, then read this. If you want to read a darker side of Harry Potter, read this."
4,How much darker is this darker book?,"Although this book has many good things to say about it, there were parts that I was disappointed with. After waiting 3 years from book 4, I was ready for some action. I had read that this book was going to be ""darker than any we've yet seen"", however I didn't think it was. Harry's main struggle was with an annoying Ministry official, whereas I was hoping for a struggle with Voldemort and his gang of Death Eaters. In those respects, I was disappointed. However, it still has a gripping plot. You get to see exactly how much progress Harry is making in school, and in growing up. You get to see some real fighting, and how powerful Dumbledore really is. I'd still recommend this book to anyone."
5,"Harry Potter: Loss, Anger and Sacrifices",J.K Rowling's fifth installment of the Potter series continues the adventures of fifteen-year-old Harry Potter as he struggles through the stage of adolescence and the return of Lord Voldemort.
3,Book is good format is shakey,"No real commits on the text (tooo much bias) but the format, meaning the CD's are badly made. The batch I purchased had bad tracks on disk 9 and 12 and the replacement package also played the same bad tracks. GOOD LUCK."
5,The BEST of the Five!,"I stayed @ the bookstore from 10:30pm to 2:30am waiting for this book, and it was DEFINITELY worth the wait!! I stayed up all night reading the the night I got it, and finished it in 2 days total :D I LOVED it! All the characters, new and old, were superb! Despite Prof. Umbridge's evil-ness, I thought she was a hilarious character (what with her 'Decrees'). I was very sad when I read the part about a certain someone being killed by Bellatrix Lestrange, but I suppose JK Rowling had to have someone die :( I thought that HP Book 5 was definitely the best book of the set so far, I totally recommend it to anyone who's a fan of HP!"
4,Voldemorts Plan Made No Sense!,"I really liked most of the book, although I would have enjoyed it more if it was a few hundred pages shorter (and without Cho Chang), however I did notice that Voldemort did not need to lure Harry into the Department of Mysteries when his Death Eaters were already there and most able to find the prophecy themselves. That's the only thing that bugged me! Otherwise, the story's great!"
2,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Overall, I am very disappointed in this book. I have enjoyed the others very much, and I expected the same from this volume. The book is entirely too long. I feel as though the entire story could have been told in no more than 300 pages. Harry Potter comes across as a very sullen, moody, unhappy person. It's very monotonous to read over and over Harry screaming at people, moping around, mad at everyone, etc, etc. The other characters aren't much better either."
2,Long and boring,"I have read all five of the harry potter book and I have even read the first four to my little sister. However the book seem to be getting worse as they go. The order of the phoenix is the worst of the five. Nothing exciting happened during the first 500 hundred pages or so. They could have made this book half as long and it would have been twice as good. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you have read the other four and want to keep up with the books then I would read it, but there are a lot better books to read for your summer reading. If you do not have lots of time on your hand and your not 12 or under don't read it."
5,"Order of the Phoenix, First time reader's opinion","I saw the first two Harry Potter films, however, I did not read the books. As an adult, reading The Order of The Phoenix, (while, my only knowledge was that of what the films had shown), I found this book totally spellbinding! I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel, and had a hard time putting it down! While I understand these are supposed to be children's novels, I truly believe that adults can enjoy them as well. The fantastic writing and imagery imparted throughout the book was totally unique to today's comtemporary literature. Simply a good-read, a book that stands apart on its own!"
2,And your point is...,"I'm sorry, but this book was pointless. Even worse, it seemed bent on making us all hate the characters. Ok, Harry's a teen, but does he have to be a brat? And does his 40 year old godfather have to be worse? Not to mention Snape, of course, and Umbridge. What exactly is she trying to prove with the parallels between Sirius and Harry, anyway? I had a hard time caring what happened to Harry, and frankly it was kind of a relief when Sirius well...you know. Why did Harry love this creep anyway?? Sorry, but this book was way off course. She would have done better to allow Harry to develop some kind of meaningful relationship with an adult--if not Sirius, why not Lupin?--for once. He needed Sirius, Sirius needed Harry, and JK turned let them both down and turned them into incredibly nasty people. So nasty, in fact, that it's hard to understand what motivates them to fight evil. Why doesn't Harry just go over to the dark side and stay there?"
2,Should have been better,"This movie was just OK. Considering the actors involved, I expected better acting. A movie with the title ""A Good Man is Hard to Find"", should have focused more on what a ""good man"" endures and tries to accomplish in his everyday life.The lead male character is a blue-collar worker who is married to a newly accomplished MBA graduate. The husband has paid for her education and at one point in the movie she practically emasculates him by saying that his brain is small and she should have never married a blue-collar man. Oddly enough, her despicable behavior in this scene is never addressed again in the movie. This is one of the things that is experienced by many good men in the African-American community. A man who tries to be the best man he can be, but is constantly berated by his woman, because he drives a bus, or cleans floors. The movie could have dealt with this on some level, but failed to really make a point in the end."
2,Another boring Sunday Movie,I'm sorry..this movie lacked the hype I expected. I think the director took away the talent these true actors and actresses had to offer. But then again most of CodeBlack entertainment films are poor in quality and production.
3,This movie needs a band-aid,"First off this is a terrible title for the movie!!!! The main character is a good man, but he didn't get what he needed to do, and neither did the female lead. The editing or the script or the direction of this movie needed a bandaid because I ended up turning this movie off, which saddened me b/c most of the cast are my favorite actors/actresses. I didn't get why someone had an attitude one minute and then there was a clip of the same person two seconds later wanting to get it on, that was DUMB.I don't knwo some movies there doesn't need to be a story, you just want to see your favorite actor/tress on screen, but this movie, i was like what is the point of this movie? church, love, what? 2 many subplots, the lighting was good for a low budget movie."
5,Makes me cry just thinking of the songs! I LOVE IT!,"We received this as a baby gift in 1998 when our son was born. It was played every night in his nursery as we rocked him. We played it for our daughter many times after she was born as well. Now that they are getting older, I keep it in the car and whenever I am stressed with the kids, I just pop it in and it takes me back to those precious moments I spent rocking them. WHAT WONDERFUL MEMORIES! I still find myself singing or humming ""All the Pretty Little Ponies"" to my daughter when she is having trouble sleeping. This is such a wonderful alternative to the ""typical"" lullabies you hear. It really gives you a nice collection of songs that even adults enjoy listening to. We also bought his other collection...just wish he would make more!!!!!"
2,Whole album not as good as the Title Song,"In case you are attracted to this album because you've heard the title song -- beware. I really like the song ""Return to Pooh Corner"" so I bought the whole album. I didn't like the rest of the album nearly as much. It's a little to ""soft rock"" for my tastes; kind of lulabye music -- but not really. Definitely not 'get-up-and-dance' music. I recommend ""A Child's Celebration of Song"" album which has many good songs by various artists including the song that initially attracted me to this alubum ""Return to Pooh Corner."""
1,DAMAGED/SCRATCHED,"This is the only item that has been damaged that I have ordered through Amazon. I will continue to order items still. Luckily it was not a costly item, so I am not stressed over it. Thanks for your concern, Kim JosephI didnt keep any of the paper work or CD, tossed it all."
5,A remarkable album,"My two children wore out three cassette tapes of this album, and now we are going for the CD. This is one of the best ""bedtime"" albums on the market, and not just for children! I recommend it as a gift to anyone who has children or is expecting a child."
5,"HEAVENLY, NOT JUST FOR BABIES!","I purchased this CD for my 25 year old daughter in honor of the second anniversary of our reunion; we were separated by adoption 23 years before. The Rainbow Connection had been playing in my head, and I knew she liked the song too, so I started looking online for possibilities. I listened to the samples, and had tears in my eyes. Along with Somewhere Out There and Never Never Land (from Peter Pan, my daughter's adoptive mother chose her name from one of the characters in Peter Pan), I knew this was the perfect choice. I've listened to Kenny Loggins since the 70's, (and coincidentally he was instrumental in my daughter's coming to be) and I truly find it comforting and reassuring to celebrate so many life passages with his music. I know my daughter will be touched by these songs, and if she's not a Kenny Loggins fan, she'll soon become one!This CD, and other Amazon suggestions, will become my standard baby shower gift for mothers-to-be."
5,soothing and reminiscient,"Not only would this album be good to send babies off to sleep (Loggins tested the songs on his own five kids), it's a good way to de-stress for adults, too, though maybe a little oversweet in parts. The poignant nostalgia of the revamped House at Pooh Corner, the sweet longing of Somewhere Out There and Neverland, and the wry humor of Paul Simon's St. Judy's Comet are great to play on your way to a rough day at work, or while driving home from one. This appeal should also help keep parents from getting sick of the album when kids request it every night for a year, as they always seem to do."
4,Love the twang--and the attitude,"I'm originally from NYC and didn't listen to much country music growing up, but I've learned to develop an appreciation for it, especially for the more traditional elements. ""Kerosene"" definitely is a promising debut for the obviously talented Miranda Lambert. By far and away, the honky tonkin', ""I can't be bothered"" is my favorite tune on the disc. None of the songs are bad, and ""Greyhound bound for Nowhere,"" ""I wanna die,"" ""Love is looking for you,"" ""There's a Wall,"" ""and the title track, ""Kerosene,"" also are very good. As at least one other reviewer has pointed out, one of the nice things about ""Kerosene"" is that the backing musicians don't get drowned out by the vocals, which allows some of the traditional elements of country music (e.g., harmonica, pedal steel, mandolin) to stand out in the mix. Highly recommended."
1,Steve Earle Anyone?,It it just me or does Kerosene sound just a litle too close to Steve Earle's Feel Alright?
5,Wonderful CD,"I love this Cd by Miranda Lambert. All songs are good. My favorite is ""Me and Charlie Talking"" Just love that song and can hear it over and over,but I also want to hear all the songs as well!"
3,"It's for the Graduate programs, not Undergrad","This book is a really good resource, but be aware it really only talks about Graduate programs, not Undergraduate programs. There is some really good information in here about each school though."
1,Watch the size,"Size I have ordered was 52, the tag says 52 but actual size was like 38. I guess someone missed up sizes. Have sent it back."
5,Wonderful Lullabys,"I purchased this CD after hearing my niece's that she has had for over 9 years. It is the best music to send your baby off to sleep to. If you are in the market for lullaby's, I highly recommend purchasing this one. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Great Photos,If you want to now the exact positioning of hands and feet this is a great book. The 'dance step' layout of the foot positions for the pommse is very original and helpful. Into Moo Duk Kwan buy this one. Note this book covers to Pawlgae 3.
3,moodukkwon 1,"historically i needed this book to make the set , for reference as well as fine detail which it covers"
1,I would rather have a cassette walkman,The display is hard to see unless you have a well lit area. The buttons are hard to figure out. The thing feels and looks cheap. I bout it because it was on sale and returnd it a few day later. The good thing about it is I dont own it anymore. Im getting the Samsung Nexus 25 with XM.
3,Henley teapot,"Henley Teapot is just want I expected and pours beautifully without dripping, but the silver solder around the spout joint and handle was poorly finished making it a very rough finish. Not very attractive to look at. Delivery time and packaging was excellent"
1,Very Small - Personal Use Only!,This tea pot is very small. It measures about 3 1/2-4 inches diameter. I'm sending it back!
5,A Simple Review,"What can I say this is simply a ""Masterpiece"" In my opinion..The Guitar work and Layne's vocals make this a ""Classic"" in Rock!...A ""Must Have"" in your collection."
5,Near perfect Alice in Chains,"First off, Alice in Chains is an AMAZING band. I bought ""Jar of Flies"" after hearing ""I Stay Away"" and ""No Excuses"" on the radio. They are such amazing songs, but the amazing thing is that the best songs on the album aren't even heard on the radio. ""Don't Follow"" is a fantastic song with an unimaginably great harmonica solo underlaid by a toe-tapping grove set up by Sean Kinney and Mike Inez. However, the pinnacle of this album has to be ""Nutshell."" This song has been my favorite Alice in Chains song ever since my first experience of this song. The simple beauty and heart-wrenching lyrics are enough for me."
5,Simply their best,"This is the disc that got me into Alice In Chains. The epic Rotten Apple is smooth and dreamlike; the emotional Nutshell is a masterpiece. AIC successfully experiment with some new sounds on this album, and the result is a very powerful and diverse set. Buy it, listen to it, enjoy it, love it. It's AIC at their very best."
5,"A work, you can't deny!","AIC became known for their dark grungemetal and broke through with ""Dirt"" in 1992. This 7 song mini-cd is just great! It offers a lighter side of AIC, but yet staying in darker songs ""Rotten Apple"" & ""Nutshell"" are very sad, but they're beautiful and calm. ""I Stay Away"" and ""No Excuses"" sound brighter and they're just awesome! the country-like ""Don't Follow"" is perhaps about growing up and moving on, and the last track ""Swing On This"" is a fun swingy song. The themes of the songs have very much drug and death relations, but there's more hope in many of the tracks too, it's kind of perhaps about the guys seeing the world different than during the writing of ""Dirt"". The instrumental track ""Whale& Wasp"" is nothing that special, but it sort of gives you a very special feeling. This is mostly for people who truly love AIC and understand them. But obviously it's a masterpiece in general, and remember, billobrad no. 1 pos.!"
5,Very jazzy and smooth,"This is one of there more calmer songs that has a very nice jazz mix to it. Every song in this deserves a well earned 10/10, nothing less expected from Jerry/Layne"
5,Great,"Not really grunge which is why I love it, like Soundgarden this band has a unique metal edge which makes their music way more enjoyable than crap like PJ or Nirvana."
2,Softer side of Dirt,"This is one of the better albums from Alice in Chains, albums, not Compilations. This is a softer version of Dirt, and just as Dirt was not heavily diverse, nor is this EP. This EP is all slow jam rock, when you are sitting with your friends passed out for whatever reason this will be on. The highlights of the EP are I Stay Away, which had great radio airplay and sticks in the mind of many with its great vocals and lyrics. No Excuses is mostly acoustic before it kicks into a rock guitar and a slightly reverbed chorus. It is also a bit more peppy than any of the other songs on this EP. Whale And Wasp is probably named this because of its whaling guitar, while a bass guitar and what sounds to be a cello hum along. This is a totally soft instrumental, but a good addition to a soft CD. Swing On drifts through with a country feel with a harmonica, a light guitar and lyrics of deep thoughts. Good EP, however it is quite short like much Alice In Chains releases."
2,Black vinyl ~ Not the blue & orange,"Anyone who is looking to buy this obviously likes AIC and they know how good Jar of Flies is and and how good Sap is.So I'm not going to talk about the music.I want to make sure everyone is aware that this album is NOT the limited edition color vinyl. Amazon is selling the black vinyl. So you have to ignore the picture which shows the album cover with the yellow ""limited edition color vinyl"" sticker. And also ignore the ""editorial review"" which makes reference to the blue and orange vinyl.I wish Amazon would edit this page because it is a bit misleading. When I bought the record, I had a feeling that I would receive the black vinyl....and that is exactly what I got. Its not what I wanted, but it's what they gave me."
3,Interesting,"Sorry, but Alice In Chains only need ONE acoustic album. Although they are often very well done, it doesnt quite satisfy an expecting AIC fan."
5,2nd best Cd ever,"This is a great CD, only Aenima by tool is better. It is so creative. AIC reinvented themselves with this album, kind of the way Radiohead did with Kid A. They slowed down their songs and wore their hearts on their sleaves. Nutshell is the best song I have ever heard, it is one of my top 5 without a doubt. Anyone, whether or not you like AIC, go buy this album f you want to experience beautiful music."
4,"Haunting, the single best grunge/alternative album","The drawing point for me with this band has always been Layne Staley's powerful wailing vocals, especially when he harmonizes with Jerry Cantrell. Incidentally, Jerry's guitarwork here is probably his most refined and beautiful of the band's career together.Standout tracks include ""Rotten Apple"", ""Nutshell"", ""I Stay Away"", ""No Excuses"", ""Whale and Wasp"", and ""Don't Follow"". You'll notice that this comprises almost every song on the album; that's how good it is. The only comparatively weak song on here is ""Swing on This"", though it is certainly not bad in its own right.The only other complaint I have is the length of the album. The album is over far too early. I give this album 7.3/10, or 4 stars. (Definitely worth purchasing, with lasting appeal)"
5,Classic from a Great band,"Jar of Flies is a nice classic from one of the best bands of the 90's. It's softer than Facelift or Dirt, but is wonderful. The songs are dark and beautiful, with amazing lyrics from Cantrell and Layne. I really recommend this classic from a great band to everyone who enjoys rock music."
4,Another Well Done BBC Product,"Very interesting costume drama about an assertive lawyer (barrister?) in 18th Century England whose interest is always in protecting the meek and the innocent from the rich and famous connivers who would have their way regardless of their brand of ""justice"". When tired of the juvenile and unnecessarily violent junk that masquerades these days as ""drama"" on networks and cable stations, try the Garrow Series."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"The author should have consulted someone in medicine or anatomy/physiology before writing this book. Being without a tongue does not render one incapable of making noise. There was reference made in the book to the ""mute not being able to scream"" because he had no tongue. It is the vocal chords that enable us to make noise - the tongue enables us to form words. The sound comes from the vocal chords, so unless these men had their vocal chords severed, they were still capable of screaming. As a reporter, one would think she would have done more in-depth investigation prior to publishing. It also raises the question as to the efficiency of her editors."
1,Badly Written,"I can't believe I stuck to this book through the end. I started skipping the ""historical"" flashback chapters about half way through the book. The last 25 pages were not clearly written, it was up to your imagination to fill in the gaps. The reporter is off doing her thing but we have no idea how that relates in time to what the main character and his entourage are doing until the very end. The writing about Jean (a very minor character) and the reporter read like a story from someone in junior high. I, also, will not be grabbing a book off the shelf with this author's name on it."
4,NOT SCARY!,this was an awesome book but it was not scary!it has a surprise ending.this was a great book! read it!
3,pure science fiction,"Christopher Pike is changing writing styles, and I'm not sure if it's for the better. Each of his latest books have been shifting toward a more philosophical, science fiction approach. Read the Final Friends series, or the Remember Me series, and then open this book. Two totally different pieces of writing. I prefer the Remember Me and the Final Friends over Starlight Crystal whole-heartedly. I wanted to stop reading this book in the middle, but since I've never not completed a novel, I decided to keep reading. It wasn't until the last 5 pages of the book that I noticed the cultural and personal self-improvement connections to society today. It was then that I knew Pike had written from the heart, and not just another novel. The last moments of this novel saved it from being a disaster."
4,Almost Perfect!,Welcome to freedom! You will experience a life change. This could have been perfect if I didn't have to wear a transceiver (though small). I have seen units at work in which you only wear a head set (built-in transceiver): but I couldn't find this online.
1,No pull--Hurt!,"At first, we thought this harness was great. Our dog who usually pulls like a mack-truck slowed-down quite a bit due to the restraints that went under her front legs. However... when we took her on a short hike, we realized later--to our dismay--that it would pulled her hair and created sores under her arms and where the straps pulled through the ring at the top of the harness. She now is still recovering two weeks later with 4 huge scabs where the harness rubbed her. Ps--it has nothing to do with the size adjustment on the harness."
3,"as i was saying,","I had read this a very long time ago, this seemed like a condensed version of the actual book. funny as time goes by, how you can read a book at one point in your life and really like it and later read it again and not find the same thrill. just saying.. it is still an okay book of fiction of the old WEst Days. as such."
3,Idiot's Delight...missing a piece,"It's great that It's available at all. They should have included the alternate ending to this movie. TCM showed both endings last time I saw It, and It was really a great insight to what the people who were releasing the movie, wanted you to see.Two different ways of looking at the same situation. Maybe they'll include It with the next edition."
3,very different,"the whims of a mad man, twisted, keeps you guessing.... hammerhead is a very different movie, makes you kind of wonder what may happen to your love ones..."
5,Incredible,This is so life like you feel compelled to take care of it! Everyone loved it! I want to buy more.
1,NOT THAT GREAT,"I disagree with all others who reviewed this album. This album is somewhat decent for its time ('94) but overall, the beats are garbage. I think Eiht really stepped up his game when he came out with Death Threatz. The beats on that album are great and I give that album 5 stars."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.......,"I remember reading about this album in Rolling Stone. It had 2 stickers on it. It had the usual ""parental advisory"" sticker (is there a rap album that doesn't) and another one saying ""the lyrical content on this album strictly represents the views of the artist"" (or words to that effect). The article's main point was asking ""are albums going to get two labels now? What's next?"". So, my ""I hate censorship"" side got all flustered, and I went out and bought it. It's a piece of s--t. The beats are boring, and all the lyrics seem to consist of is ""my name MC Eiht. No one better mess with me"". He pads this wonderfully original thought out to 70 minutes or so, and it gets incredibly tedious. Needless to say, the sticker ""controversy"" never erupted into anything beyond this album. I just ended buying a really boring album, and I immediately got rid of it."
3,Formulaic,"Sketchy with shallowly drawn characters.The heroes are devoid of flaws and the villains devoid of redeeming qualities, and it's all very one dimensional. Interesting plot line though."
