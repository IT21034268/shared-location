2,"Intriguing premise, spotty execution","I knew nothing beyond the jacket blurb when I rented this video. But when I got into it, it intrigued me enough to sit through the whole thing (in two sessions - it's a VHS two-reeler on the long side).See the other reviews for plot details. It's an intriguing premise. The chemically-dusted protagonist comes only gradually to realize he is growing younger. The slow unfolding of that proposition occurs like artichoke leaves being peeled back, well done. The byplay between the elderly couple (Keith Szarabaika and Frances Sternhagen) is very well acted, sweet and almost believable. The heroine Terry (Felicity Huffman) is nice eye candy. The villain Jude (R.D. Call) is duly evil but somewhat over the top. But much of the other acting is truly over the top - the ""mad scientist"" Toddhunter, the Major, the hippies, etc. Those exaggerated, caracaturish personae get in the way of what began as a promising plot. The ending leaves one kinda unfulfilled, too."
3,"Interesting, but Have a Good Dictionary Handy!","I agree with the previous reviewer that this collection of essays belongs on every literate person's bookshelf. After all, Trilling's essays on Frost, Wordsworth, Keats, Austen, the artist and neurosis, and the teaching of modern literature are essential for all students of English and indeed anyone who cares passionately about literature and its place in our society. His essays are engaging, his content original, and his diction precise. However, as Trilling was a professor at Columbia, he tends to verge on the erudite. That is, his rather advanced vocabulary and at times archaic, complex sentences do not make for easy reading. More than once I had to reach for the old Webster's to decipher his meaning. This is the only major drawback I saw, aside from his essay on Keats's letters being WAY too long. Still, with all its academic emphasis and at times difficult vocabulary, THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO BE INTELLIGENT is an essential and engaging book."
5,Excelent cd!,"Well If you are a Sonic fan (why would you be looking this up If you weren't?) You will like this cd. I find That I really like ""His World"" and ""All hail Shadow"" by crush 40, I guess that because I am a die hard Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 music fan. The Zebrahead version Is pretty fun though! It has a nice fast beat. The cd is a little short but the tracks you get for it are great!"
1,Only Bought It For Zebrahead,"the cd is weak and boringbut that Zebrahead version of His World rocks! why they used the slow one i'll never know but i know i only bought it for the Z track i needed the hard copy of that song for my collection, a mp3 just couldn't do it i need hard copies!"
3,I have better books,"This book is ok if you are a beginner.Some ideas are quite old fashioned, I prefer the ""Encyclopedia of Scrapbooking"" instead..."
2,Good info but not enough,this book is just a whole bunch of people talking about there careers..........your better off making some meetings with people in your industry and picking there brainsnot only would it cost lest.....you would get more out of it
5,Wonderful read!,Modoc was a wonderful book of the life and times of a circus elephant and its special relationship with its trainer who was born on the same day it was! It is fascinating (and of true origin!). I would highly recommend this book! You won't believe this story....
3,OK for the price,"The pedometer works pretty well. You have to be sure to wear it on your hip if you want it to count steps accurately. It only accepts stride measurements in even numbers: 28"", 30"", 32"". So if your stride is 31"" you have to set it to measure a bit more or a bit less than the actual distance you walk."
2,My unfair Lady? or Gentleman?,"Everyone with this movie often focuses on the whole Aubrey verses Julie controversy. Should Audrey Hepburn have been in it? Should she have used her own voice? That's all good and fun and important questions. What drives me insane however isn't Hepburn at all, but Rex Harrison. He has most of the songs and he ISN'T SINGING!!!!! Give me a pitched! Just once! PLEASE!!! I never know if I'm listening to a musical number or not because the dang man won't sing. So I can't hum along with any of these songs and get them stuck in my head because as far as I've ever heard, they don't have melodies. I'm not sure why this never gets brought up, but to me it seems this is a musical without music. It's like telling me the movie is in color and then it's all in black and white or telling me that the movie is a scary movie and giving me a chick flick instead. Get a main cast who can sing/are allowed to sing.Oh, and change the ending. That part stunk!"
2,My Fair Lady is a travesty on BluRay,"""My Fair Lady,"" one of the most glorious films ever made, has been shockingly thrown away on BluRay in a transfer that looks like you're watching a three-hour dream sequence, for the sides of picture are a dull, foggy mess, while the center is sharp and colorful. It's definitely not in the same league as ""Ben-Hur"", ""The Sound of Music"" and ""The Ten Commandments"" important blockbuster roadshow films of the mid-century which got releases worthy of their stature.But ""My Fair Lady"", in 1964 the most eagerly awaited film since ""Gone With the Wind"", and the winner of numerous Oscars, including Best Picture, has been dismissed in a mediocre single-disc transfer which does not do justice to the BluRay format. Send a message to CBS and demand that the crown jewel in their library get a proper deluxe release."
4,My Fair Lady,"This is a great movie. I wish the DVD had more features, but, for the low price, I feel like this was an excellent purchase."
5,Audrey Shines as Eliza,"March 2006 marked the 50th anniversary of the opening on Broadway of Lerner and Loew's My Fair Lady. I was priveleged to see the original starring Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews. Fifty years later we are still humming the songs from this beautiful play. In the mid-1960s Audrey Hepburn brought Eliza Doolittle to the silver screen. I thought no one could replace Julie Andrews as Eliza. I must admit that I was very much mistaken. Despite the fact that it's not Audrey singing, she took to the role of Eliza as if it was especially created for her and gave a magnificent performance. Sadly, Audrey was cheated out of the Oscar for Best Actress in 1965. The My Fair Lady DVD of the movie version is of high quality and is a wonderful way to preserve this classic film. I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages."
3,Quality of the film,My Fair Lady is a two-tape set. The first tape was very good quality. The color of the second tape was very poor and the picture was not sharp. I was disappointed.
1,Shame on You CBS !!!,My Fair Lady is the 1964 Oscar winner for Best Picture and is one of the very best musicals ever made; it is a classic that deserves the same stellar treatment that The Sound of Music and Ben-Hur received. CBS's indifference to one of its crown jewels is an insult to the artists who made it and to the consumer who is frustrated and being asked to pay for its substandard quality
1,Should have been Julie Andrews,"The role of Eliza Doolittle My Fair Lady was originally created by Dame Julie Andrews. Who was superbly spectacular- no one could take place. Which is why i can't stand watching this movie! Audrey Hepburn (who was only good in Breakfast At Tiffany's) was horribly mis-cast! First of all, Audrey cannot even sing! She was dubbed- and Marni nixon (the one who dubbed her)isn't even that good. Julie Andrews acted and sung the pact perfectly. But it's ok because Julie won an Academy Award the year My Fair Lady came out anyway- for Mary Poppins- Audrey wasn't even nominated- with good reason too. And you gotta love Rex Harrison, who also created the role of henry higgins alongside Julie Andrews on Broadway. Because Rex fought and fought to get Julie Andrews on the movie of My Fair Lady. This movie is nothing because julie is not in it- (...)But, we later found out that even Jack Warner voted for Julie at the Academy Awards- which she won!"
5,Music with heart & soul,"I found this cd to be very engaging. The tracks are full of imagery and the harmonies are very crisp and clear. The songs seem simple but the lyrics are very evocative. My friend's children were dancing around when I played it for them. It's a great mix of gospel, country, folk - something for all."
2,Sad swing,"I can't say I don't like this CD - I love Ella, songs are well selected, the players - Clark Terry, Harry Edison, Benny Carter and Al Grey - are in more than good shape in spite of their advancing age, rhythm sections are excellent, arragenments are appropriate and swinging (Ray Brown, who plays bass, is responsible for musical side of organization, while Norman Granz arranged the date as such)...However, the remnants of Ella's voice are sad to hear, even her rhythmical agility has gone.I planned to give it three stars as an acknowledgment of fine supporting players (and, naturally, for sentimental reasons), but I cannot do so in the context of exaggurated praise of other rewiewers.This is strictly for fans of Ella's back-up musicians and for us uncritical jazz fans.Quite an unfortunate ending to an unique career."
4,'Cosmic Slop',"Of all of Funkadelic's Westbound albums, this one, in my opinion, was the most R&B sounding. The concept, on the other hand, was as deep as any of Funkadelic's LP's. It was like Holland/Dozier/Holland on acid. The title cut was one of the most tragic songs in music history: A mother having to sell her body to feed her children. Deep. I agree with one of the previous reviewers that this album, despite a couple of up-beat tunes, was probably the most disturbing and sorrowful album that Funkadelic ever put out. The gritty, urban realism of 'Cosmic Slop' pre-dates the realism of modern Rap music by over 20 years.George Clinton and his crew were way, way ahead of their time."
2,The dvd didn't work,"I received the disc , popped it in and got an error message. I was very disappointed! I hope this never happens again."
4,Only reference around,"I purchased an old Dt250E and needed a manual. Typical of the genre, the book is a guide but not definitive for each model. Better than nothing!"
1,Doesn't fit a Honda Ridgeline,"I bought this for a Honda Ridgeline. Unfortunately, the way it is made (it's not a full-length 2"" tube) it's not workable except on just-right hitch receivers is there is such a thing. I can't use it."
5,My 4 year old & 2 year old boys love Cowboy Pooh,My sons love this movie and ask for it to be played over and over. They both love trains and are delighted for a story that integrates Pooh & friends and trains. I only wish it would come out on dvd (we're on our second videotape since the first one wore out with so many viewings).
2,Don't leave the 100 acre wood!,"The disappointing part of this video is that one story happens at Christopher Robin's house: seeing him and his mom takes away from it to us - also Pooh, Tiger, etc. are now about 1 foot tall because they are shown in relation to a big dog. Stay in the 100 acre wood and remain a fun fantasy! Not the best of Pooh tapes and we've seen about 6 - my 3 year old loves ""Cowboy Pooh"" and ""Detective Tiger"" and started out on ""Sharing and Caring"""
3,Winnie the Pooh/Pooh Party,My son is autistic and it's all about the box. This box had some wrinkles that he does not like.
1,"Poor Quality Blades, Shaving time increased, and Razor Burn...Ouch!","As pointed out by the other reviews the moisturizer around the razor head wears unevenly. During the first use I was required to re-shave all areas of my legs 3 times and still had areas that were not smooth. Shave time was increased and final outcome was a total disappointment. The soap does wear unevenly and because of the size this is a horrible razor for curves, underarms, and the bikini area. Don't waste you hard earned money on this shoddy product."
1,Marginally worse than the song!,"This is probably the most ill-conceived product out there. First of all, as it has been pointed out in another review, this is a VERY poor quality razor. Without it's soaper, it's a dollar store item. Secondly, the soaper goes all the way around the blade. I don't know about you but I generally shave using the sharp edge of the blade only ... so, after the soap wears out on the leading edge [in about 3 legs-worth of shaving!], it is necessary to give a swipe of the razor in the opposite direction before actually shaving, in order to get any soaping action. This seemed to double my shaving time rather than shorten it. I wish I could express more effectively just how much I hate this product. I also wish I could get that darn song out of my head ... I mean, come on Jewel, it sounded like a jingle the first time I heard it!"
2,Could have been better...,"The film seems to focus on 70's punk exclusively. Anything post-1980 is glossed over, clumped together and generally viewed with dissapointment by this ""documentary"". I think the film does well documenting the roots of punk, seeing as how Letts was steeped in the scene at that time (although The Misfits weren't mentioned, which I found odd). The interviews with Henry Rollins and Jello Biafra were great as well. However, in order to claim to be a documentary, the evolution of punk rock is just as integral (perhaps more so) as its origins. I think, basically, Letts based the film on his own opinions, likes and dislikes instead of actually documenting punk. I was disapointed."
1,horrible lip pencil,i received my prestige lip pencil few days ago and i was inlove with the color so i deceided to try it on that very day.the pencil is so hard like a stone.my lips hurts so bad and i wont buy again
4,An ABSOLUTE must read,"If you are serious about doing the will of God, then this is a book that every Christian should read."
5,Bandsaw tire,This tire fit my delta bandsaw perfect. I had to soak it in hot water like the instructions said. It works Great.
5,The right lid,"I ordered this along with the 8 inch skillet. I can't be happier. The lid fits perfectly. It came pre-seasoned, which was nice."
4,An excellent sequel to Eva Luna,"This book focused on the stories of Eva Luna (which is the book that chronicles the life of the narrator of this book). I found it even more interesting than Eva Luna. The stories are richly told. Isabel Allende did an excellent job writing this book. The stories are bout characters from the book of Eva Luna, some made up stories and others about her lover. A great book."
5,This incredible noval is full of susupense and excitement!,"The stories fo Eva Luna is an exciting short story book written by Isabel Allende. This book contains various short stories about love, adventure, and mystery. Allende has a great way with words. She makes you want to open the book and never stop reading. I definitely recommend this novel to everyone. Her captivating work becomes interesting to the reader because she writes about her deepest and darkest secrets. These stories are about peasants and particians, revolutionairies and tyrants, seductress and fortune tellers."
1,logitech force steering wheel,"this wheel is very nice and fun to use with GT3. BUT it's the only game that it works with besides Nascar 2002 .does not work with any of my other games like WRC , F1 2001 , or my brand new long waited V Rally 3 . since i have already beat GT3 and bored with driving in circles with nascar..."
3,"Fine, but weird","The wheel acted like if it had a mind of its own. When I used this wheel to play Test Drive racing game, it apparantly tried to 'fight off' my grip and against my correct direction by using its own preference. It also behaved like that when I loaded up Test Drive to try out the wheel. Its so scary to know that some insideous life form is inside this wheel! Other than that, the wheel will not work with other games as one critic correctly claimed. So I agree with him that this wheel will only work for Test Drive, though it will not work much with the Other Test Drive 5,6 and Off-road as I thought it would. I gave this three star rating because, frankly I would somewhat be reluctant to purchase a replacement because of this forboding experience with the wheel, with a spooky personality of its own."
4,Wild Ride!,"The force feedback on this weheel is phenomoenal, althought it takes some adjustment to get used to the forced ""sway"" the car goes into at high speed straightaways!I unpacked it, hooked it up and was using it in (no lie) ten minutes, and I even made a mistake (make sure you hook it into the top USB port). these devices are tricky and are rarely usable across all game platforms, I don't care what they say. But Logitech has set a standard that I would hope other game manufacturers will follow. Just on GT3 it will take me weeks to adjust my cars, adjust my play and improve my score.What fun!"
2,Ok but not great,"These are not great quality. Nice looking, but super thin. Not sure how they will hold up after a few more washings!"
3,Action figures,I thought the quality was very good for the price and this would be good for anyone wanting a matching set for display.
3,a good dog will run until his brains explode.,"neuseiland is a halifax ""supergroup"" of sorts, featuring charles austin and drew yamada of superfriendz fame with joel plaskett from thrush hermit on drums. the album is interesting but uneven, with a few standout tracks, most notably the instrumental opener. it's got a hypnotic power that will render you docile. there is some straight ahead alt-pop here, but the band seems to be reaching for something a little more lofty. at times, it succeeds. a jangly folk rock number (untitled, of course) is an unexpected delight. i hope this collaborative effort has a little bit of staying power, because i think the best from neuseiland is yet to come. pick this up along with thrush hermit's ""clayton park,"" sloan's ""twice removed,"" and the superfriendz ""mock up scale down"" and you can consider yourself a true haligonian."
5,Nice viewing,"Just relaxing & enjoyable to watch. Great color, better than when I watched the show all those years ago."
5,Great Family Entertainment,"I loved this show as a young child because Bobby Sherman starred in it. I was so happy to see it available on DVD. Robert Brown, David Soul, and Bobby Sherman play the lumberjack Bolt Brothers in frontier town of Seattle. Watching again as an adult made me appreciate what a really good family show this is. It's funny and from a more innocent time. It's a show that you and your kids can enjoy together. The characters are great together - Bolt brothers, Lottie (Joan Blondell), Captain Clancy, Candy and Biddy......and guest stars you'll recognize like Bruce Lee. It lasted for two seasons and I was hoping to find Season Two available but not yet I guess. I think you will enjoy this show whether you remember it or whether it is something new to you."
5,good entertianment,Great family entertainment. I watched this show together with my two preteen daughters and we had a great time.....Highly recommend and cannot wait until Season two is out.
2,"Over priced, nothing new.",The ideas and teachings in this book are just a regurgitation of easily obtainable information available in any Instructional Design publication at an extremely inflated price. I don't know what Patricia Smith and Tillman Ragan think they have here but I should write my own and sell it for a third of the price.
3,hard to read,"I found this very hard to read, plus there were so many type o's. It was a very good story (insightful) but so much went over my head."
1,WHAT WAS THE POINT!!,"This book was chosen for a book club selection and all 12 of the members agree...why did she even write this book. There is absolutely no point. I was very disappointed in the characters as well as the overall storyline (if there was one). Amy may have turned out to be a strong woman in the end after all her abuse by her parents, But we will never know????"
2,Probably not what you're seeking,"I actually picked this disk up at a Seattle's Best Coffee shop with their logo on it. Too bad it wasn't a giveaway item. Be advised that the four Beach Boys tracks seem to be alternate studio takes or demos. It's no wonder they used the other, better versions. The Jan and Dean tracks are better, but still probably not those you heard on the radio. And one isn't even close to being a 'surf' tune. The tracks from The Deltas (actually Jim Waller and the Delta's, I believe) are not too bad. But they're a bit off the path for surf instrumentals. For a better mix of surf music, I kind of like 'The Best of Surf Rock, Vol 1&2' or Rhino's 'Rock Instrumental Classics, Vol. 5 (Surf)'. If you really want a Beach Boys compilation, get 'Endless Summer'."
2,"Maybe It's just not my type of book, but it was BORING..","While I thought the idea was fascinating, and potentially engrossing, I found myself continually flipping ahead looking for something to *happen*... It picks up a little bit in the second half of the book, but nevertheless, I found the plot to be a bit too meandering, with very little ""grab you"" element..."
2,Very Badly Done,"No character development, terrible science, paper-thin plot, and truly horrible writing. Great idea for a book, but this isn't that book. Skip this one! It gives science fiction a bad name."
5,Halperin's at the top of my favorite authors list.,"Fabulous book. I tend to read slowly and savor every word, which means a good book might take a week or two of bedtime reading to be finished. I read 3/4 of The Truth Machine in one sitting 8pm-2am, and finished it the next morning, 20 minutes before writing this. I like the world the Truth Machine brings about. I had heard about the internet birth of this book, but didn't pay much attention until Amazon.com recommended The First Immortal, which I devoured a couple of months ago, and which has remained on my mind ever since. So it was Mr. Halperin's second novel which prompted me to read his first. I can't recommend books any more highly than these two companion works."
5,Halperin Weaves a Believable Future...,"James Halperin has once again hit the nail on the head. I picked up ""The Truth Machine"" as an impulse buy a while back... when I saw ""The First Immortal"" in the bookstore, I grabbed it immediately. If Mr. Halperin's suppositions about the future are even halfway correct, and I've seen none that ""felt"" more accurate, I'll definitely be signing up for some cryonic suspension of my own. My advice: BUY THIS BOOK. And start saving your pennies for your own suspension."
1,This book hurt.,"Halperin is obviously trying to be the next Michael Crichton: taking a ""hip & cool"" topic, gathering bits of info to back it up, and then trying to build it into a novel by filling it with cardboard characters. I saw this in The Truth Machine, and The First Immortal confirmed it. I have no doubt that James Halperin could write a good story by concentrating on characterization; I'll just have to wait for it. Also, I crack up at the abundance of books out now which involve cryonics and nanotech in their plots. The way authors & scientists are talking about it, you'd think it already existed to the degree they say. My favorite - just because a method doesn't currently exist to reverse freezing damage to tissue, that is no reason not to put someone in deep-freeze right now. Just like everything else in cryonics, we're sure the cure will come SOMEday, we just have to wait. Yeah, right..."
3,Freeze yourself and become immortal,"Like Halperin's ""The Truth Machine,"" this book isn't great as fiction but has an intriguing thesis. Halperin is convinced--and wants his readers to be convinced--that we will soon be able to stop the process of aging and, thus, that we should have ourselves frozen shortly before death, to be revived when medicine has advanced far enough to halt and reverse aging and to cure our diseases. Halperin presents his case in the form of a story about a man who is frozen in 1988 and revived in 2072, when aging has been conquered.I read this book a few years ago and have continued to think about the ideas in it. It seems reasonable to suppose that we will indeed eventually figure out how to halt aging and that this will be one of the most radical turning points in human history--that future humans (the rich and powerful ones at least) will die only of ""unnatural"" causes."
3,"Some interesting aspects,","This book has a few things going for it, but I felt it lacked the tension and drama I look for in this sort of thing. If you liked this novel, you might want to check out ""The Last Day,"" by Glenn Kleier. It's a far more thought-provoking suspense thriller with a truly unusual, surprising plot. My favorite read in '99, so far."
3,"Yes, but...","I adored this love story with an Edwardian setting when I was much younger, and it's still great romance, but on a recent rereading I had to overlook class snobbery, racism, and anti-German paranoia. All of these are due to the period in which it was written, and probably reflect the attitudes the characters would have had, but still, it's a bit hard to take sometimes."
1,It's not the super source.,What the author wrote in the book doesn't match the title of the book. The explanations are not clear -- a bad written.
4,Better than what I was expecting,"I am a big scifi fan and a friend recommended this film. I was plesantly surprised to see Paul Mercurio. I have been a fan of his since Strictly Ballroom. He was quite believable as the hero ""Hawke."" What I liked was that he wasn't completely gung ho and he had a few good oneliners. The storyline was believable and the effects weren't bad considering their budget. The acting was good, especially the main characters. I liked this much better than the first Star Trek film (original cast) and I'm a big Star Trek Fan. I plan on buying the DVD to add to my scifi collection. A good Saturday Afternoon flick."
4,Role Model for women,"Maya Angelou is such an insightful writer. She has a very colorful background that explains why she is so well liked. She certainly knows about many, many aspects of life and has come a long way in her life. She is a true role model in the world. Not just for black women but for all women."
4,"Seems well made, fits my needs but.....",The unit arrived in great condition and was packed very well. I share the concern of other reviewers that bottom of deck of the unit is two pieces with an approximate 4” gap between to front piece and the rear piece. This would not be a problem with an old vcr but with the much smaller footprints of today’s Bluray players it is. I can’t really take points off because of this since I was well aware of the issue prior to purchase but it is something to keep in mind. I will have to fit something to cover the bottom deck so my player sits properly.
1,Only the worst!,"This could not get any worse. If your a fan of Big Mountain stay away at all costs! This has nothing to do with them, and actually states as much on the CD Insert. I have been a fan of Big Mountain for a long time, and this is not their classic reggae sound, [...]crap.STAY AWAY!"
5,"Geoff Simmons, M.D.. What Darwin Didn't Know","Worthwhile read. I found the first half a little heavy in the physics and sometimes hard to follow, but the bottom line was always readily apparent. The second half was particularly worthwhile. It does make one think about light, Schroeder's theories and how scientists truly are at a loss to explain it's quirky behavior and ubiquitous presence."
5,I Love Full House!,"I can't wait to watch all these seasons! I should be getting it in the mail by January 29th, Michelle Tanner is my fave character"
4,Fascinated,"My toddler is fascinated by this line of toy. We have a ton of them and he will get a hold of them and just stare at them. turning them over and over in his hands trying to figure them out. How they work, make the noise, or shake them into action. He spends hours playing with these blocks and absolutely loves them."
1,Not healthy in the long run,"Love 4 out of 6 blocks. Need to teach healthy habits by showing healthy choices of food- what happened to the veggies? Why would you put cake and cookies as food for infants... this is going to teach little ones to consider these items in the same category as fruits - this is very unhealthy for the child's mind. I wish they would get it right. Healthy ideas, healthy toys, healthy kids.... no junk food allowed. So you would have to throw out two blocks - then it is a bit expensive for only 4 blocks."
5,Undiscovered Country,This is undiscovered country if you have not been paying close attention to your Hitchcock films. The concept of this book is intuitive. These places were there all along in all of Hitchcock's film. But San Francisco seems to hold a special place for Hitchcock. This is a rich study into the meaning that San Francisco holds fot Hitchcock.
1,Ripoff,"I didn't order this and here's why. A pack of this gum is 25 cents at the store checkout, which you can even see printed on the package in the picture here. 40 packs at 25 cents is $10.00! They want over $13 for this? Doesn't make sense why anyone would buy it!"
5,Want more depth and integrity?,"The Challenge Deck is a great tool for growth. This is not about having more success at work or in you relationship as much as, like the Way of the Superior Man, it is about living your life as an expression of your deepest truth (although acheiving that certainly might improve your work and relationships).Every card gives you something to do, either right there in the moment or over a few days, that challenges you to live with more integrity, more openness, more aligned with your deepest purpose. These are not easy new age prescriptions-I knew the deck was powerful when, after looking at the cards, I got a twinge in my stomach and said, ""oh, no!"" (actually something amazon.com wouldn't print), realizing that the challenges would clearly push me and were things I wanted to do to grow.Highly recommended! As a man, you can't avoid growing if you take on these challenges."
2,only to show the same screen,"This is not bad, but if you want a dual screen with different, then this isn't for you. This shows the same screen, but one of the screens becomes very lite and not very good quality."
4,I got white cables and blue connectors,Not the item pictured for sure! It did work. This says I need eleven more words before I submit blah.
1,((( DID NOT WORK CORRECTLY ))),"The company was great at refunding my money. However, the product created stretched images on my computer and HDTV. It did not work for my needs"
5,"All right, Mr Demille, I'm ready for my close-up.","They sure don't make actors or movies like this anymore. Sure this is probably the most campiest movie that has ever been transferred to DVD but you know something,,,,it's worth every penny.The DVD transfer is wonderful for both picture and sound. Watching this on DVD sort-of has a hipnotic effect on you,,,,,it keeps you wanting more and more and the time just flys by. I wouldn't say this is a great motion picture but very much an important film of Americana and something we should all be proud of. After all Gloria Swanson was a queen back then and this was the film that has had endless renditions to from musical stage to comedy routines on tv. Well worth having in your collection."
3,Beautifully restored -,"Even if you haven't seen this before, it is worth buying for the awesome transfer that they have afforded it, and also for the classic that it is ...A silent screen actress lives in a fantasy world longing for the stardom she once had, to the point that she really believes it is all coming back. Enter William Holden to help the fantasy come together. What we end up with is a tragic story which demonstrates how loneliness can affect the mind.Heaps of extras add to the appeal of this DVD. A must own."
5,GREATEST FILM EVER MADE,"I AM A HUGE FILM FANATIC AND IM VERY DISSAPOINTED IN WHAT IV SEEN FILM TURN INTO. WE GET THESE FILMS NOW DAYS THAT HAVE NO REAL STORY OR IMAGINATION LIKE ""AMERICAN PIE"" MY FAVORITE FILM USED TO BE THE GODFATHER UNTIL I SAW THIS ONE AND THIS BECAME MY TOP CHOICE OUT OF THEM ALL. IT'S CLASSIC CINEMA AND IT'S THE WAY ""REAL"" MOVIES SHOULD BE MADE. IT FALLS INTO THE CATIGORY OF GREAT FILMS LIKE THE APARTMENT AND SOME LIKE IT HOT. I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS FILM TO ANYONE WHO LOVES TRUE MOVIES AND WHAT THEY STAND FOR."
5,Holds Up Beautifully,"It's always been fashionable to believe that the old Hollywood films were greatly superior to those of today. Unfortunately, when one takes an honest look at many of the so-called classics, the dating of the material tends to ruin the viewing experiece.SUNSET BOULEVARD is a stunning exception. It holds up so well that it almost feels current. In fact, with today's entertainment fixation, I'm tempted to say that SB could be released in the present to the same acclaim it received back in the 50's. It was that ahead of its time.Scores of films since then have tried to comment on Hollywood, but none of them have reached SUNSET BOULEVARD's watermark. SB manages to tie its criticism of the movie biz to several other themes while treating the audience to an engaging plot. You certainly can't say that about BURN, HOLLYWOOD BURN.SUNSET BOULEVARD is almost good enough to convince the viewer that they don't make 'em like they used to..."
5,"Never a ""fan"", until now.","I have, ""Listen Like Thieves"" on vinyl. I liked that album. I used to listen to INXS on the radio and have watched their videos, yet never got ""into them"" more than that.I'm happy having, ""Shine Like It Does"". It brings back memories of listening to them on the radio in the car. I also really appreciate their earlier work. I'm impressed by it. It's all good.If you are new to INXS or are re-introducing yourself to the band, this anthology will do nicely.M. Hutchence - R.I.P.P.S. - If anyone is ever suicidal, get help by calling a helpline or talking to someone (a friend, a relative or even a stranger).We are often lonely, yet never alone."
5,"An excess of ""INXS"".","This is whithout a doubt the best collection for the ""INXS"" fanatic. It's 2 cd's, and 42 songs, of the best of their lengthy and glorious career with ""Michael Hutchence"". The first (early years) disc, includes all the highlights from the debut, to ""Listen Like Thieves"". A number of real early songs are on that, plus hits like ""The One Thing"", ""Original Sin"", and ""What You Need"". The 2nd disc is from ""Kick"" on, that includes ""New Sensation"", ""Disappear"", and ""Taste It"", with a few songs being the single edit, or different mix. A big extra to me, is the inclusion of ""Let It Ride"", which was only ever released as a cd single. All this music, and a booklet full of numerous photo's, and band history. My only complaint is the packaging, I never do like the cardboard cases. The more casual fan might want the 21 track ""Best Of"". That has the best of this, and is much better than the older ""Greatest Hits""."
5,Luxury Leisure for Less,"After reading ""Luxury Leisure for Less"", I found myself getting excited about all the low-cost activities I would have on my kitchen calendar in a couple of months. I think this book has timeless information that can be used by anyone who does not want to spend a lot of money to have fun. The information provided in this book could be used in the city or in the country--it is universal information. I even plan to use some of the basics leisure for less tips during my next vacation to Paris."
5,OH my god.,I will put this as simple as possible. I have purchased this disc twice already. Once it was aquired by someone who thought they needed it more than me and now my most recent copy died in a car accident. I am now purchasing it for the third time. enough said. BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT. you will never regret owning it.
4,No Buying?!?!?!,"I absolutely love this movie! I watch it all the time at home, however i just moved to college and wanted to get it on my laptop. Unfortunately this movie isn't even on iTunes so I came here. I found this in instant video but stupidly enough you can only rent it! The movie deserves a 5 star rating but because amazon only gives the rent option I took a star away."
4,Out of this world comedy,"Winter sport and comedy lovers will find this predictable but hilarious. We all know the story. The cute misunderstood guys get their mountain (ski resort) in the end but the way they get it is very funny. Naturally there's a bad guy who tries to buy the mountain and commercialize it, and there is a love triangle just to appeal to everyone. The extreme skiing scenes will make you feel their pain while you're laughing. Don't let any of this keep you from seeing it. If you like comedies you owe it to yourself to see this one."
2,"Nothing you havent seen before, but...","This is just another in a long line of comedies that feature gross out humor and guys trying to get laid. Trust me you have seen it all before. On the other hand there is some great snowboarding scenes, at least one incredibly beautiful babe, and Lee Majors! Lee is holding up pretty well and dosent look like he has aged much since starring in ""the Fall Guy"". He plays a bad egg in this film.""Out Cold"" bills itself as ""Animal House on snow"", but that is wishful thinking. The humor dosent come anywhere near ""Animal House"". There is very little here redeeming enough to recommend this one, but there are a couple of chuckles, and it dosent break the cardinal sin of being boring. If you like cheesy movies like I do, then you may want to rent this if nothing else is available. If you are a snowboarding fan, you would probably appreciate it more than the average viewer as there is alot of this in the film."
5,one of my favorite movies,"It's a nice movie to watch, doesn't get old. Good action and pranks throughout the movie. Totally lacks Will Ferrel in it."
4,Pure fun!,"Out cold was a very good movie in my opinion. Aside from the obvious Casablanca mimics, and there are many, this film is fun, smart and witty! Although it's not a movie that requires a great deal of attention or brain power, it's definately worth watching for a kick and good laugh!"
4,Inspiring and helpful,"I liked this book, it was recommended by a woman in my running group. It doesn't give you any hard and fast answers but maybe that's because every pregnancy is different. Some of the tidbits about real life moms who ran through pregnancy are inspiring, from a woman who ran a 3:45 marathon when several months pregnant to the woman who had to scale back her training due to pregnancy. I would recommend this book to runners who get pregnant and want to keep running while pregnant."
2,Running and Pregnancy is just ok,"I didn't find anything really new or useful in this book. it was ok if you've never read Runners World, but it was brief and not very helpful. I liked Exercise Throughout your Pregnancy much better than this book."
5,"Excellent CD, Great Polynesian Songs!","We heard some of the songs in our recent trip to Bora Bora and Tahiti. I searched all over and found this CD. It really is a great collection.Our favorite songs: Bora Bora Nui and Aroha E 'Aloha Oe' (both by Kaina Boys)Buy it, you won't regret it!"
5,What a voice! What a collection!,My sisters and I love Jay Chou's singing and the work he put into these albums and music videos. I would highly recommend to get this collection for yourself or a friend/Asian girlfriend. Jay is like an Asian version of a Justin Timberlake.
1,Arboria patio furniture quality poor,"I purchased pieces from the Arboria Idlewild collection late last fall. These pieces did not even make it through three months of outside weather. They mildewed, splintered, withered and warped. I then read the ""warranty"". It promised nothing more than that!"
1,poster,nice poster. Its for a xmas gift. It took over a month for delivery. not happy about that. will never order a poster from amazon or poster revolution again.
4,I Rarely Cut Myself Now.,"No I don't seem to cut myself anymore even when shaving in the slippery shower!The shaving 'soap' is made so that my legs and under-arms feel silky when I'm done. It doesn't seem to dry my skin out. And I don't use one of the refills made with special non-drying products!The handle grip could be made a little less slippery when shaving underwater.I am able to go around knobby areas like my knees and not have to worry overmuch that I'm going to slice them open by going to fats. Don't get me wrong you can still cut yourswelf, it is just that to do so takes a lot more effort.o"
3,Enjoyed but broke easily,"This was my first serious blender. As in I decided to spend more than $25. I was happy with this product for the first six months using it mostly for smoothies. It did not do quite the job I wanted in crushing ice, generally leaving small chunks. It was good enough and better than my previous blender. Six months after purchase I found that the spinner on the bottom, that spins the blades when the pitcher is on, had broke and was spinning loose. I was very disappointed with such an obvious flaw.I bought another Oster, just to be loyal, and found it performed significantly better. Unfortunately I can't find it here but it made this one look like a counter-top decoration."
2,after one year of use,"The more I use this blender them more I dont like it. I think I will just trash it one day.- it is extremely loud- the motor smells like it was a ready to catch of fire while working- the top lid is not good, it does not fit properlyStay away from this one."
2,Broken without ability to repair,"I used my Oster to blend frozen smoothies. It worked okay. It would eventually get the ice and frozen fruit to blend, but it required a lot of stopping and stirring. It was really loud (but most blenders are). After about 5-6 months of smoothie making, the shaft/axel that goes from the motor to the blades sheered off. As far as I can tell, Oster doesn't sell replacement parts for that problem."
5,The FIRST Comic Hero EVER!!!!!!!!!,"I saw the film years ago, about when I was 5 or 6 give or take, and loved it! I couldn't stop watching it. So when I became an Amazon member a few weeks ago, I remembered the movie and wondered if a novelization was available. Lucky for me, Amazon had it and for such a good price.MacGregor did a spectacular job putting the screenplay into novel-form. As I read on, I remembered all the scenes, all the lines, all the amazing acting done by the cast. This goes down as one of the best movie novels i have ever read.This is a must have for any comic movie fan.PARTY ON, DUDES!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Wistful sampler of Cocteau Twins,"The only complaint one might have with this CD is its brevity. The four tunes here are so well-knit into a cycle of musical and emotional cohesion that if Cocteau Twins only released one recording, ""Love's Easy Tears"" would still distinguish them from all pretenders. Just before the magnificent ""Blue Bell Knoll"", the band runs through trademark synthesizer washes and keening, other-worldy singing. It's worth a listen, since subsequent albums reveal a change in style and lyric clarity. ""Love's Easy Tears"" is a sample of Cocteau Twins unique and scintillating sound."
4,Good Source for Hikes,We got this while we worked in West Yellowstone. we enjoyed several nice hikes that were in this book.
3,"Great Movie, Dissappointing DVD","Dog Soldiers is an often exciting, tense and funny B-horror flick that's definitely worth your time. Sadly First Look's re-release is a real let down. The image quality is fine and in 16/9 widescreen, but none of the extras promised on the back of the box are here. No featurette, no commentary, no trailers, no sub-titles of any kind and no chapter selection. The audio seems to be in 2-channel stereo as well. A rather underwhelming presentation. Try to find the Fox release instead."
3,Dog Soldiers- Good Saturday Night Fun!,"I'm not going to say much; I'm not a film critic nor do I think I am one like so many other reviews I have read. But I will say that if you grew up watching movies like The Howling, Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th (only the first in each series was worth watching) then you'll enjoy this movie.But if you don't, just sell it on eBay...."
3,Entertaining,I am not sure if this is a horror movie or a comedy. It is sort of funny and really cheesy. But hey if you like this type of flick its for you. I own it and it does have some replay value but its not a top shelf DVD.
1,Avoid at all costs,"This has to be on of the worst movies of all time. the acting is really bad, the special effects are hardly special and the plot looks like it is being made up as you look on. I've wasted many hours of my life watching bad movies but this one is really up there with the likes of Bulletproof (the Gary Busey one) for the title of worst movie ever. At least Bulletproof was entertaining and watchable, this movie just isn't. you have to ask yourself not only how did this movie ever get made but why did the writer even bother to finish it. It would have been better for everyone if the writer had just torn the first draft up and become a raod sweeper."
2,Fun Film - Terrible Transfer,"The negative review score isn't for the film - I actually dig Neil Marshall's take on 'survivors band together for one last stand'. It's the high levels of grain that accompany the transfer to 1080p. I'm not sure if it's how the film was shot or just the lack of care taken with it, but this is a definite skip on BluRay. This looks exactly the same as my DVD version, with virtually no features. Glad I picked it up on sale, anything more than 7 bucks would have been a rip off."
4,Uncommon Anxiety Builder!,"I won't waste your time with the premise of the movie, as it is adequately described elsewhere. Simply put, Dog Soldiers crafts an interesting backdrop and interweaves a blend of concepts upon a familiar siege film. It works very well!Story summary: There's a little mystery to this military exercise gone wrong story. The anxiety builds as the impending doom is lowered upon a British Army team. The wolves employ techniques that the team recognize as familiar. Will the human soldiers be resourceful enough to win against the strategy-inclined werewolves? Will they survive this horror version of Shaka Zulu?Good character development, use of foreboding, and thrilling action scenes make this film a winner. This is much like a werewolf version of 30 Days of Night or other siege films. Very interesting and exciting. You won't be disappointed."
3,Great Movie - poor Blu-Ray,"This, by far, is a fantastic film. I will not talk too much about it. The problem I have is that the DVD Release has special features. What happened to the Blu-Ray? Good grief, at least give the same content to the Blu-Ray. This is a sad use of the space and features that Blu-ray can give. If this is a first release and then a ""Special Edition"" is released, later to try and force a double dip... Too late. I already doubled up when I bought this version."
2,Werewolfs are waiting outside...,"A squad of soldiers is on a standard training maneuver on the Scottish Highlands where they are suppose to encounter a unit of Special Forces. However, the military exercise is swiftly cancelled when they find the Special Ops soldiers slaughtered and the radio out of order. Stranded in the wilderness, the soldiers find themselves not being on the top of the food chain as something fierce is ready to snap at them at any moment and from any direction. Dog Soldiers begins with a very interesting premise, however, this changes as the story unfolds and temporarily the film becomes awkward. Nevertheless, there are some first-class horrific moments that will startle the audience, but the overall experience ends up being a cinematic frustration."
2,Not so scary,Typical ...possibly more gory than some in this genre-A 'once is more than enough to view it' movie-
2,Not ready for prime time,"Even Rob Lowe admits in his recent memoir that he could not imagine a major studio green-lighting this weird mess today. Themes of incest, bisexuality, rape, lesbianism and May-December romances aside, this totally fails to capture the John Irving novel on which it was based. Jodie Foster, Natasha Kinski and, especially, Rob Lowe, are all way too inexperienced as actors to make this complicated farce even begin to work. Lowe was so pretty, with his rosy cheeks, but his acting was lousy here. Are we supposed to believe that Beau Bridges, who looks about 35, was the father of Lowe and Foster here? I did not. This thing veers and lurches all over the map. Ultimately, it's pretty dull. For a 1984 production, it really shows its age."
5,CAT LAX,GREAT PRODUCT. CATS EAT A SMALL BALL OF CATLAX 1-2 TIMES/WEEK AND SEEM TO ENJOY THE TASTE. IT KEEPS THEM MOVING WELL. THE COST OF CATLAX ON AMAZON IS VERY GOOD -- MOCH BETTER THAN THROUGH PET MED WEBSITES OR THE VET.
2,Contains Petroleum Jelly,"Didn't find the ingredients posted in the Amazon ad. It does contain white petroleum, which isn't so good for a cat on a long term daily basis."
4,Good for poor GI tracts,"This stuff has the consistency of toothpaste, and is firmer when cold, runny when hot, and smells kind of like caramel (it doesn't really taste like it though..don't ask). Sometimes my cat will eat it right out of the tube, others I have to put it on his front legs so he ""cleans"" it off. He won't touch it if it's on his food, though.It's so nice how much cheaper it is on here than at the vet, where a single tube can be upwards of $6.50. One tube lasts about two weeks, but my cat needs it twice a day; ymmv. I don't use it strictly for hairballs; my cat was hit by a car and now has a narrow pelvis which makes elimination very difficult. This does help nicely with that."
4,What's Up Tiger Lily,"This is Woody Allen's ""first"" film. Actually, a Japanese spy film which he overdubbed with his dialogue...having nothing to do with the original concept of the film. He changed the tone of the film by inserting new scenes, rearranged the order of existing scenes and changed the film from a James Bond genre into a comedy...the search of the worlds's besst egg salad recipe!This is Woody Allen in the ""youth"" of his movies...a must for Allen Collectors!"
3,Other Reason To Get this Movie,It Has Great PERFORMANCES on a soundstage by the LOVIN' SPOONFULperhaps the only footage that ALLEN shot other than his fake interview within the film as its director.Ignore the Sophomoric comedy in this childish Woody Allen film and tune in to the LOVIN' SPOONFUL soundtrack
1,"What's Up, Woody Allen?","Every time I try to watch a Woody Allen movie, I am reminded of why I don't like Woody Allen movies. I had to turn this one off after twenty minutes. Yes, it is making fun of exploitation films and so I expected it to be silly, but it is a boring, stupid kind of silly, like listening to a group of teenagers dubbing in the dialogue to an already bad movie. Even when I was a stupid teenager myself, I thought that ""Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex"" was only marginally funny. But this is worse. Why do so many people like Woody Allen movies? If you want some grown-up satire of exploitation movies watch ""Kill Bill"" instead."
2,is this real??,"yeah, um i dont think so... i baught this book for my fifteen year old child. basically, he is a loner (my child that is). he does not have any friends you see. he is all caught up in the ""napster"" craze and only leaves his room for feedings and to visit the toilet. anyways... i thought that this book could help in making some new friends. unfortunately, none of the ""friend making"" skills presented in the book could ever be applied to everyday life. my son has shown no sign of making any new friends. i feel that this book is a let down and has no practical meaning what so ever. use caution when deciding to purchase..."
5,Great start to a fine series,"The perfect book to start your beginning reader off on and a must have for amphibian lovers of all ages, these stories are beautifully illustrated and each holds the key to a simple truth. Chiefly about friendship, Frog and Toad are able to make the best of their situations by accepting and utilizing each other's differences. The simple prose flows across the artful pages, and after reading this first one your child is sure to want them all.J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"
5,Classic stories,"These were some of my favorite stories as a kid and I can't wait to share them with my son now. Easy to read, simple illustrations, classic short stories with little life lessons to share."
5,Arnold Lobel is the Ernest Hemingway of Children's Lit,"This is a lovely book. The adventures of Frog and Toad are my favorite (and not just because in every friendship a little Frog or a little Toad must fall). The sentences are clear, simple and clean but always descriptive. The subject matter is age appropriate and fun. My son and I listen to the stories in the car on our way to school. Our fav is the Button story and often in complete exasperation I will yell to no one in particular ""The Whole World is Full of Buttons and Not one of them is mine."" Sometimes that just sums it all up."
3,A modest reference book.,"Robert Jackson's ""The World's Great Battleships"" is a quaint little reference book that attempts to cover warships that lead to the development of the battleship from the middle ages to the 1940s. This task is nearly impossible in a book that is only 147 pages long. In short, Jackson should have focused on battleships, and only battleships within this book. With a start at HMS Dreadnaught on towards the USS Montana class (which was never built). While the images and basic details of select classes of warships is a very nice feature of the book, overall I would have preferred the book to focus on the most relevent battleships in the evolution of this type of warship rather than a quick overview of multiple classes.Still, the book is a good ""quick-grab"" reference book to find the basic details of the more famous classes of battleship."
3,2 1/2 stars for a comedy of unlikely events,"This movie contains a collection of characters that seem impossible in real life even if I actually do think they exist. I do wonder how many find each other. While this may be a passable comedy, it wasn't very entertaining. I found myself cringing when the Paul Dano character holds up a bra as if seeing if it fit. His door is open at his college office. Now you just know he's going to be found out. That whole cross-dressing story line seemed terribly unnecessary. The real focus should have been on Henry played nicely by Kevin Kline. He was interesting. Katie Holmes, making a rare appearance as an actress since she became a mommy, plays her small role with low key elegance. The movie, while a modest time waster, is well made from a production standpoint. Just not my cup of tea."
3,Ignore the trailer,"I was intrigued by the trailer for this movie and seduced by what appeared to be entertaining comedy. This is a false portrayal. The movie has a dark and depressing side. While it does have its humorous moments, it is not a comedy."
1,not 1 for REAL horror fans,I really think sean s cunningham should be ashamed of these movies especially this.i can sum it up for you. it doesnt scare you no good horror.the origanal is ok!.but the sequels are totally worthless.it is like watching star wars.i cant believe any one would like this this is no where near as good as halloween resurrection or jeepers creepers 2TOTALL RUBBISH
5,Jason X Suits Generation X,"I mean, wow! What a comeback for the old guy. He's been shot, stabbed, skewered, burnt, hung, electrocuted, squashed (Part 7 mask scene with Tina), buried, chopped, showered with toxic waste, drowned, fried, rammed by a police car, a balcony collapsed on him, and now frozen for 500 years, and gone into space. This movie in the F13 franchise was like Red Dwarf meets F13: Maybe the old saying ""there are many ways to skin a cat"" applies to this film, sure you can stab a man, or a woman, but Jason has showed us so many ways on how to do it. It was fresh and original. All we need is Jason to be in a spoof of Big Brother meets Survivior, only this time, when someone gets evicted, it involves Jason carrying out the dirty work. Hell, my mum works in real estate, she would put a sticker up once Jason was finished with the victim - ""It's Gone Now!"" I'm not going to give away the plot - i'll let you the viewer, judge it for yourself. Enjoy...."
2,The worst one but not real bad,"What were they thinking when putting Jason in space i agree with making something new but not something stupid. I admit the death scenes are pretty cool and the cinemotography isnt real bad but the score, the special effects, and especially the acting is real bad. The story for this one is i have to say isnt bad but how they used was pretty bad. A research team studying on jason find out hes more powerful then they think and he escapes and kills everybody except for a girl who lives to cryogennicaly freeze him and herself as well while 300 years in the future college students find Jason and defrost him and the girl on their spaceship when jason comes alive and starts killing people. This is the worst in the trilogy but it is not the worst horror film ever created."
1,why god why new line cant make a good jason flick,new line cant make a good friday flick.his maks sucked the plot sucked its like star wars meets a jason with bad acting and a bad script
3,'X' - Tremely Funny!,"This is the tenth movie in the ""Friday the 13th"" series... Shouldn't Jason be like sixty years-old by now? Well, he gets cyrogenically frozen along with a doctor and they're found by a group of bizarre people four hundred years later. They thaw out both of the artifacts and Jason starts to butcher again. Jason used highly inventive ways to exterminate the unfortunate and boy, were they funny! A face is frozen and then smashed into a table, plenty of dismemberments, and here's the best: two girls in a Camp Crystal Lake simulation getting tossed around in their sleeping bags. Sheer comedy. ""Jason X"" was so ridiculous, it was hilarious."
3,Take for what it is...,"In order to do something different, which everyone complains is not done enough these days, the producers of Jason X decided to put the walking murderous mongaloid into space. Set in the future, Jasons luck holds out as he is cryogeniclly frozen and discovered over 450 years later. As you can imagine, chaos ensues and the creative killing juices flow. Wastefully knocking off gorgeous female scientist students, professors and military grunts. Jason X is a lot of fun. I may have enjoyed it just because I was expecting something so much worse. But I have to admit, it was fun to watch Jason finally meet his match when he comes up against the lovely cybernetic android. Intrestingly, there are a few smart glimpses into Jason's biology explaining why he is the unstoppable killing machine that he is, giving some reason to the madness. Just don't take it to seriously and ignore those who expected someting more from a sci-fi slasher flick."
2,For serious Friday fans only,"The fan in me loved Jason X, but the critic in me hated. First let's start with the fan part. The film has nudity, great one liners and good death scenes that one would expect from a Friday film. Now the critic in me knows that h can pull a better film out of his a*s. The movie is horribly edited, the dialouge is horrible and the acting is very tepid. There's also no back story what so ever which would have been nice to see.See this one only if you're a serious Friday fan."
1,worst jason movie,First of all i thought this movie was going to be totally different. The movie takes place in space he starts killing people then they cant stop him so they use a robot who by the way gets real cocky. Only jason fans will like this so if your looking for a good horror movie dont bother buying this movie rent it first.
2,Where's The Gore?,"I'm a BIG Jason fan and I went to see this movie with an open mind. ...It [stunk] to put it bluntly. All I saw was neck breakings and some throats being slashed. Hardly the inventive killings of the ""old school F13th days"". Where's The Gore? As a writer I've been disappointed with the plotholes these so-called ""writers"" left in the last 3 movies. There's NO plotline continuity whatsoever that the older movies had!They should have stuck with the Crystal Lake Mythologies instead of the ...plotlines of 8 9 and 10(X). Kane Hodder as Jason is awesome, but since he won't be playing him in Freddy vs. Jason that will probably [stink] too. Jason X had some moments but overall, not that great."
3,WORST JASON MOVIE EVER BUT THE KILLINGS WHERE GOOD,"THIS was the worst jason movie i have ever seen. what was the point of him going to space they just should of had it on earth where the other ones took plkace. the only reason i gave this 3 stars was one the killins where cool he freezes this girls head and then crushes it. that got one star the 2nd star came from when he killed so many people and the third one is when he pictures earth and these topless girls ask jason if he wants to have sex that was pretty funny so if you are going to watch this m,ovie watch it for those reasons."
2,Jason goes sci-fi,"Jason X, is what I think is what would've happened if Jason Goes to Hell didn't happen the possibility of he wasn't sent there. While the Friday the 13th movies always been known to be more of a horror aspect from its inception in 1980 up to its big finale with Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday. This movie feels more of a science fiction movie than compared to being a horror film that the franchise has come to known as. I'm not saying that's a bad thing but it's like a interesting idea to move Jason away from the typical of what we've come to know about his character, still killing people even in space. Although this may not be the best film in the series but it can still be enjoyable to watch, I give the movie along with the nice extras a 2.5 stars out of 5."
3,OK,"JasonX was ok but not the best sequel. My favorite sequel was friday part5 witch people say was was the worst friday. jasonx was good but it kind of seems 14a movie when jason turns into jasonx. still see this movie it was good 28 kills the most kills ever seen in a jason movie. I was 13 when i saw jasonx and i love these movies ,if you like these movies see jasonx."
1,Destroyed The Series,"I am a big time horror movie buff. Although my favorite series is The Nightmare on Elm Street movie, I love the Friday The 13th series. This movie provides no explanation for Jason's removal from hell, the premise was just [BAD], Jason's ""upgrade"" was ridiculous. If you collect this series of horror films, LEAVE JASON X out of your collection. JASON GOES TO HELL was a sufficient way to leave this silent stalker, hopefully Freddy Vs. Jason won't do any worse for this franchise, or for the Nightmare Series. JUST AWFUL!!!"
3,Jason... IN SPACE!,I thought the idea of Jason Voorhees in outer space was really dumb. I watched Jason X on Starz one day because I was bored. Jason X turned out to be a pretty good movie that I thoroghly enjoyed. I has plenty of humor and awesome kills. I recommend renting it.
2,Disappointed,This didn't come in the right box. It was just a black case with the dvd in it. I was not aware that was how it was being sold.
3,Great movie compromised!,"Have to agree with Disney Fan from Illinois- there's no excuse for issuing this movie in full-screen only. As a consumer, it offer's me no choice. One of the reasons I enjoy buying DVD's so much, as I did laserdiscs in the olden days, is the ability to watch the ENTIRE movie, not just what will fit on a TV screen. Particularily in animated features such as this, where the artistry of the animators is as much a part of the enjoyment as the story itself. So, Five Stars for the movie, 1 Star for the full-screen only presentation. Go, Topper!"
5,A Classic!,"The Fox and the Hound is one of my favorite Disney movies of all time! My little boy and I love to cuddle up on Friday nights, pop this DVD in, and laugh, cry, and sing through the whole movie. This movie is a classic Disney movie, my family and I love it. If you don't own it, you should...it's a great movie!"
5,Another Great Anniversary Edition,"I can't add anything about the movie itself. The only reason to buy these special editions is for the extra features. Behind the scenes stuff, how the movie came about, interviews with actors who did the voices, ect. If you care about those things, this is a great set. If you don't, there is no reason to upgrade."
1,Junky clamshells,"These are the worst clamshell CD holders I've ever seen. Cheap, don't stay closed. Should be avoided."
3,works well,I bought these for my husband who has lost weight but didnt want to buy new pants yet....he loved them and wears them daily.
2,SUSPENDERS PLASTIC CLIPS.,"These suspenders have u plastic clips.They fly off when putting your pants on. Look nice but, watch your eyes. would not have bought them if I knew."
2,Not Troughton's best....,"I think the Ice Warriors are probably one of the best monster's created for Doctor Who and Patrick Troughton was an excellent Doctor. Unfortunately, this was probably not one of his best stories. This was one of those Doctor Who adventures originally released in the 1980's that was edited to be a full length movie. This technique has never set very well with me. It also makes the episode seem ten times longer than it really is. The storyline is too slow moving that you feel like you're being lulled to sleep. My advice is get the ""The Mind Robbers"", ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" and ""The War Games"" instead. They are far better examples of Patrick Troughton's talents."
3,It is OK,"This course is very basic. It is pretty much all audio - there is a word list to read after each of the five sessions, but often those words are not used in the dialogue nor are they defined. Apparently the Pimsleur method is tried and tested. For someone who knows absolutely no Norwegian, it is probably a good starter course (learning to greet others, ask for food, say that you don't speak Norwegian, etc.) There are other courses that are just a little more advanced that are less expensive."
5,An Excellent Machine,"I switched from DELL to Gateway (and from an Intel to an AMD Athlon CPU) when I tried out this machine and I've never been happier. The machine is extremely fast and reliable.The first reviewer didn't specify why they hated this system, so I put no stock in that review.I know the stores couldn't keep these on the shelves. For only $749.99, you couldn't beat the deal you got on one of these systems. Everything in the case was the latest and greatest available in September '06 when it became available. That is with the exception of the 128MB video card. For the time period it was released, it should have had at least 256MB or maybe 512MB of video memory.My friend at Circuit City says they have had 0 returns on this model, which is extremely rare of any brand (that includes both defective and non-defective returns).It is an amazing machine. Yeah, you can always buy a better machine a few weeks after any machine that you buy."
1,"Horrible, terrible, not good, bad, so very bad!!!!","I never liked Thalia as a singer or actress (but I have to admit that she is pretty and has a nice body). I only like 1 song in this greatest hits which is ""Entre el mar y una estrella"" but the rest...it's horrible. This is my first Thalia cd and by the way I think it's gonna be also the last one.She doesn't have feeling when she sings, she just opens her mouth and strange sounds come out.Well that's just my opinon. I'm disspointed because I thought that it was going to be much better, oh!, there's not even her song with Fat Joe."
1,Only Buy This For The DVD,"For some odd reason the CD in this CD/DVD combo has only 10 songs, when the non-limited edition CD only version has 16. The tracklisting by Amazon is wrong. Mind you, I'd have bought just a DVD for $20 for the videos, but it's just odd to have included a CD with only part of the songs. If you want the DVD of the videos, buy this. If you are looking for a CD of Thalia's best, buy just the Greatest Hits CD w/out DVD. I also don't understand why someone had to post a negative review about Thalia, even claiming some of these songs weren't big hits. Tu Y Yo was number one on the Billboard latin charts and they claim that it was only a minor hit. I don't really consider #1 minor. It's all relative. Love Thalia and only give this a poor rating because it wasn't what I expected it to be and that made me feel jipped."
1,"$20.00 for just one song?, I don't really think so","I have some of her cd's and she sings very good but come on, the same over and over is not interesting, actually is boring.I wouldn't buy this album becuase there are also several songs missing and the DVD is not complete either, lots of video are missing.And $20 for a new song that it's not even very good?, I say it again...I DON'T THINK SO."
1,Not good at all,"After the big failure with her crossover album, she comes back AGAIN with a greatest hits album including her few hits (well let's be honest if you release the same songs over and over is because you don't have success or faith in your self to do something different and I'm being very honest, if you don't believe me check her last albums, they all contain the same songs).I think that her fans must fell very upset with this situation. What Thalia should do is take a rest and came back in a year or two with new song. personally I think that she sings better in English than Spanish.If you have other of her albums do buy this it's simply...nothing.And by the way don't even get excited with the videos are simply HORRIBLE."
3,So so...,"Aunque no soy la fan numero de Thalia, y ya tengo un album ""greatest hits con Banda"" de ella...(parece que saca uno de estos cada año) no me parece mal el concepto de la compilacion acompañada con sus videos....para esos hardcore fans, y los que se quieren conocer mas de su musica.La verdad que tiene una que otra catchy song como Piel Morena y Entre el Mar y una Estrella....pero en si no creo que Thalia tengo tantos exitos como se dice ella tener..aun le falta solidarse como artista y que se respetada por el publico, las canciones suenan bien en el cd, pero cuando canta en vivo, es obvio que tuvo extra ayuda en el recording studio..bueno en estos dias, quien no.Y para el fan de Paulina que esta escribiendo todas esas revisiones negativas..Dude...al menos escribe diferente, es obvio que no te gusta Thalia y que sos la misma persona..disumula un poco caray...."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!,"I always heard about Thalia as being a singer, soap opera actress and because she's married with Tommy Mottola.When I saw this cd I bought it thinking that it was going to be good, but it turned out to be simply horrible.From the first song ""Piel morena"" that sounds horrible, she's trying to be like who? until ""Reaccion y traicion"" you go through a nightmare. And besides she only has 8 hits in her 13 year career?. The cd contains 10 songs and 2 of them are new, so what kind of singer is this one?.P.S: The videos are also horrible, low budget (expect the last 2).Sorry but I can only say...HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!"
1,THALIA PORQUE?,"No entiendo Thalia es de las mejores artistas porque tiene que hacer este tipo de discos? estoy llorando me ha defraudado, creo que me ire a consolar comprando PAU-LATINA, por lo que veo ese disco si vale la pena"
1,WHAT HITS?,"so thalia releases thalia 2003 in english and is major bust selling only 170 thousand copies..whats her studio to do?well gather some of thalias old material and package it to her fans as a HITS EDITION..only one problem..what hits?some of these songs never hit the top ten on the charts yet are released as hits..thats pathetic..but thalias fans are and will always remain blind..thalia never tours..and never sings live. want to know why? well buy any of her cd's and find out her voice is horrid and sounds like someone blowing a whistle in your ear. guess being married to one of musics most powerful""tommy matolla"" doesnt necesarrily mean u will be succesfull."
1,mmm,mmmm este cd esta mmmm ps solo para los que quieras gastar dinero a lo tonto mejor esperemos a que saque un cd con temas ineditos
1,Winnie the Pooh/Sharing and Caring/VHS,My son is autistic and just brought this out to me and inside the box it had the wrong VHS. Inside was a Christmas tape.
3,my son loves it!,"ok, so when i first saw this video on my on demand cable network, my eybrows did raise a bit. the engineer 'host' is a little strange.my 2 & 1/2 yr old son loves trains, and trains were the main focus of this video so we gave it a whirl. HE LOVED IT! i have to admit that after watching it 10 or so times (like i said HE LOVED IT), the songs began to get the best of me and my other kids (also skeptics) began to actually like the video. my little guy watched it everyday until the on demand menu changed and (gasp) removed Numbers Express from the lineup. So, now i am on the search for the DVD format so that we can enjoy it forevermore! lol... or until my little guy is over his train phase.so it isn't THAT terrible, and your child might actually learn about numbers, as mine has! watch it a few times, it'll grow on you too. The things we do for our kids!"
4,"Not so known, but really good...","Very good brazilian band. Mixing folk rock, blues, some 60's sounds they can make you enjoy the songs at first sight. It works!"
1,Ocean breeze shipped used DVD. I ordered a new copy.,Ordered a new copy of the DVD. Was shipped a used copy. Near the end of the movie it skips to the end. Missed the most important part. I do not like a vendor that does not send the product that was ordered. Do not want the DVD. Would like to return
2,Trite and cliché-ridden,"After watching 36 minutes of this trite and cliché-ridden waste, I am bailing out on it. It has totally failed to engage me or create the least expectation that there might be something interesting to come. A total cardboard cutout production and a major disappointment from Clint."
5,Don't waste your time!!!,"This movie had a decent story, but the seriously bad acting and a whole slew of worthless scenes about Eastwood's personal life made this movie a waste of 2 hours. I don't recommend you rent this movie, let alone buy it."
2,"EASTWOOD'S ""SEX APPEAL"" IS ANYTHING BUT APPEALING","Eastwood literally made me sick with shirt off, wrinkled skin etc. YUK. The story is okay, quite predictable but Eastwood ruins every scene he is in. Very unnatural acting -- I have never thought much of him as an actor but here he is at his worst."
2,Everything you need... except,"This motherboard has it all. It is easy to configure and/or tweak, simple to configure the IDE and SATA RAID, a convenient backup BIOS , etc., etc. I've scored this motherboard very low because unfortunately, I've had the same problem with both of the ones I have gotten. The system runs fast and purr's like a kitten for a while, and then, all-of-the-sudden it won't boot. Both times for me it turned out that the problem was in the DDR1 and DDR2 banks; and now they are both dead. System still runs fine, but only if I take out two of my sticks. I'd run the systems with top-of-the-line hardware and with both configurations, the same problem. I'd recommend the DFI LAN Party board instead of this one, I haven't had any problems with that one."
5,Innocents Lost,Jesse Stone: Innocents LostInnocents LostWe have all the Jesse Stone movies now. I was just completing our set.They're great.
5,Jesse Stone: Innocents Lost,"What can I say but another brilliant Jesse Stone movie - action right from the start. Jesse has lost his job, but whilst helping a friend gets shot at. Not a happy Jesse Stone - and when Jesse's not happy the crooks better watch out."
4,Great Movie!,"Selleck at his best! The entire production is filled with characters that you like, admire and care about - including the dog!"
4,Latest Jesse Stone,This Selleck's finest role. Well crafted story line and all roles are acted well. But you expect that from this series. This might just be the best of the bunch.
4,Great stories,"If you have watched this series of movies and like the character, you will probably like this one too. You should watch in order if you can."
2,disappointed!,"obviously not up to quality of previous Jesse Stone stories. Concentrates on Jesse's problems, not the case he's on. Too much of ""same old, same old"". Poorimitation of Robert Parker's work. If not for Tom Selleck presence, nothing!! No good feeling after watching this."
5,Jessie Stone,Tom Selleck was made for this Character Jesse Stone. I have the whole collection of these movies now waiting to see if he ever gets his job back. Love it.
4,Kaplan DAT,The book is very helpful in explaining the different topics and organization of the actual DAT. The practice exams are good resources as well.
2,Neither Hideous Nor Kinky....,"....in fact this film left me so cold I just felt like a complete on-looker which is not, in my opinion, what films are about.After a failed relationship and a seemingly dead-end life in England, young mum Julia heads off to find greener grass in Morrocco. But her dreams of adventure and enlightenment aren't going to be that easy to fulfill when you consider that her two young daughters have been dragged along with her. Alone and vulnerable in a poverty-stricken country Julia finds an ally and lover in Bilal, a local lad with a habit of thieving but as the tension between herself and her daughters, particularly the elder one, Bea, escalates Julia is forced to re-examine the practicalities and prospects of life abroad.I didn't find this film particularly good and care little for it but it could at least have taken advantage of Morrocco's beautiful scenery - but it didn't. Quite a limp affair, really."
3,Hideously Good,"Kate Winslet is a very good actress, there is no doubt about it. She is one of few actors who gives a very honest account of the character she is playing being extremely focused to her work. She does this movie a lot of justice. The story moves slow at times, but fast enough to keep you captivated. Kate is very convincing as a young single British mother on a spiritual journey and quest of self discovery in Morocco. The scenery is also spectacular. Buy this movie along with Holy Smoke if you can. It works out cheaper, it is certainly not worth the money being asked of it on its own."
1,Wrong Size,I ordered two M/L dog collars and got extra smalls ... even if I hook them together they wont fit around one of my dogs neck.I have left SEVERAL messages with the seller and they were all ignored.Don't buy from this seller unless you are willing to return the items through Amazon.
5,Communicating truth today,"Telling the Truth, edited by D.A. Carson, gives excellent insight into communicating Christian truth in today's culture with chapters by a variety of prominent evangelical leaders."
1,Sesame Street Elmo's ABc,"Too fragile for a toddler. The flaps that are to be lifted to view letters, tear off too easily"
5,BUY THIS,I cant believe i got this for $165 but when i got i would have paid even $300 or $400.great features and very pretty.another nice watch added to my collection.
2,CRAPPY SEQUAL,"the first one wasnt that great but it sure was better than this one- mildly entertaining - it will keep u watching just to see what happens in the end then you will be left disapointed and unimpressed. why bother explaining the plot? it was extremely stupid but i might as well- this time julie and her friend win a trip to brazil , take along freddie prinze from last summer and end up on the island together only to find out they were tricked later on when everyone starts dying all of a sudden. ending is predictable and lame- also has jack black in it who is pretty funny- i suggest u RENT this and do not buy it - u probably wont watch it more than once or twice."
3,Ok Teen Slasher Flick,"If I were a fan of corny teen slasher flicks, I probably would have enjoyed this more. I like how this sequel stayed true to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". The movie , again, followed Jennifer Love Hewitt's character, Julie. After her horrific summer about two years ago, Julie is still having nightmares. Later, when Julie and her best friend Karla (Brandy) win tickets to go to Hawaii, Julie thinks that she will have a relaxing vacation.....boy, is she in for a suprise. I don't want to give anything else away, so just go out and rent this movie if you are a fan of teen slashers."
4,The movie is real cool,The movie is a real cool movie but it had brandy but it's still a good movie jennifer looks even more finer in this movie the movie is real cool and scary and real intense
1,I DON'T WANT EVER KNOW WHAT ANYBODY DID ANY SUMMER,"Scream rules, Scream 2 rules, Urban Legend rules, I know what you did last summer was nearly o.k. and Halloween H20 definetely sucked but ISKWYDLS is a bigger peace of sh... than every Friday 13th sequel. For those who missed the Friday 13th sequels, don't watch this money-maker movie, it's cheap, it's boring, it's a crime.Watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre, watch Braindead, watch The Thing, watch Prince of Darkness or watch Scream 2 for the 1000000000000 time but don't waste your time with this Beverly Hills 90210-Horror Edition, please"
3,three words: Jennifer Love Hewitt,"This movie had many problems: ridiculously bad writing, slow start, sloppy directing. But everybody in the world should see it because of the amazing Jennifer Love Hewitt, who gives her best performance to date. She acts as good as she looks, and no one else can make the terrible lines she's forced to say sound so palatable. Contrary to every other reviewer here, I think Brandy did a good job, as did Mekhi. Freddie and the others weren't very good. Above all, despite all its problems the movie was A LOT OF FUN, and isn't that why we watch movies in the first place?"
1,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"This has to be one of the stupidest movies ever. It was not scary, it was raining through the whole movie, and that Brandy got on my nerves. Acting was poor, bad plot and Jennifer Love just screams and yells to much. I would much rather reccommend the Scream Series because those are the best."
1,as bad as they come,"Even the very worst ""slasher flicks"" of the 80s were better than this. This movie has a totally predictable plot. Annoying acting doesn't help either - I had no sympathy for anyone who got slashed in this movie. For a real horror treasure, check out ""Nosferatu Phantomn Der Nacht."""
1,"Dumb, dumb, dumb!!","I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is one of the stupidest films that I have ever seen! I read another review of this on Amazon, saying that anyone who doesn't like it is not a big horror fan. I love horror films more than anything and i think this rots. The first one was extremely good, partly because Sarah Michelle Gellar was in it. But ohmigod! We knew a victim for 10 seconds and then they died. You didn't care if anyone died, except Freddie prinze, Jr. as Ray. And even he was only in it for 30 minutes. What a terrible waste of gorgeous people and even better actors and actresses."
3,"When you bury the truth, make sure it stays buried...again and again and again","Sequels. There the second chapter of a horror movie that always come out bad or can come out good (rarely). This sequel was very weak, predictable, and dare we say it, ""It's not scary."" Jennifer Love Hewitt is back and is not even getting annoyed in this ""killer-never-die-until-you-kill-them"" thing. It's getting real annoying in the horror genre, but hey, the fans like it. Well for this sequel, we did not ask for one, but the company wanted to make money out of it. They succeed as I wasted money on this. BEN WILLIS is back, and he's gonna kill them all in the Bahamas cause he still knows what you did last summer."
2,No Comparison,"This movie just didn't compare to the first, which remains one of my favorite suspense films.While ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was creative and innovative, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" just rehashes tried and trite horror movie concepts. (Namely, small group of people isolated in a remote location with no way of escape gradually gets killed off.)"
2,I do NOT what to know what they did the summer before last.,"Misnamed and misbegotten sequel to an okay original - stunningly stupidly written and with wildly OTT directing and music, it's unscary and has the same pathetically obvious sequel set-up ending as the first one. Only worth watching for a good performance from Jennifer Esposito - and for the luscious Jennifer Love Hewitt."
1,Silly and stupid.,This movie was trying to do what Scream 2 did and did not come anywhere near it. A ridiculous script and silly acting kept this from being a great sequel.
2,last summer?,"Although this movie isn't really worth the time to review one way or the other, I just have to point something out. If the killer in the first movie was mad about what they did ""last summer"", then by the time this movie happens, it's the summer before last that he was mad about. So it should be called ""I Still Know What You Did The Summer Before Last"". Or, if the killer is now mad about both summers, it should be ""I Know What You Did For The Past Two Summers"". Or, if the new killer is only mad about last summer, but indifferent to the previous summer, it should be called ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", just like the first movie. Or, to cover all the bases, maybe it should be, ""I Always Know What You Do In The Summer, And It Always Pisses Me Off"". Just a thought."
2,"Lots of gore, lots of predictability","I really liked the first film because it focused more on suspense than gore. With the sequel, suspense took a backseat. It was basically just hooks in the eyes, throat and chins, and no curiosity as to what might happen next. Now don't get me wrong. I think Jennifer Love Hewitt is hot as hell, but the filmmakers could've made it less cheesy if they didn't have her running around in a wet t-shirt for the duration of the movie. It was such a throwback to those 80's slasher films. Also, I knew right from the beginning who the killer's accomplice was. Will Benson! That sounded a little too much like Ben Willis. I knew originality wasn't in Hollywood's dictionary, but they could've come up with a name that wasn't so obvious!"
2,Disappointing and By the Numbers,"While the first movie was a solid suspense film with high production values, this gratuitous sequel is nearly a polar opposite.Basically, ""I Still Know..."" is a standard teenage hack and slash with more gore, but none of the heart and earnestness of the original picture. The T&A shots of Love Hewitt are blatant and smutty in their intent (this coming from a huge Love Hewitt fan who would otherwise enjoy such scenes).One can almost see the money-grubbing Hollywood suits rubbing their hands with glee at the idea of anyone plunking their hard earned cash on this turkey.Only horror junkies would find anything redeeming here. No recommendation (rent before you buy)."
5,very pleased,it is very nice to purchase an item [made in america] that meets all claims.Back to preparing wood for a small wood stove and find this tool indispensable. Purchased atamazon
4,Power of Love Shirley BasseyWhat,What can you say about Bassey except she's the greatest female vocalist ever and that includes opera greats. Why she's never been a sensation in this country is beyond me.
2,review,Mary has wrote MUCH better books I felt lectured and judged. Usually I stay up to read till 3am and this one I scanned the last 2 chapters. All the other ones were perfect till I read this one. I love Mary and her books I just felt there was alot of resentment coming from her and I was disappointed.
1,negative straight,"Which movie is worse, this or Street Fighter? Everything about this is wack especially that non-straight Raiden(Gayden). The showdown at the end is horrible, animalities?! I remember thinking that this would be a good movie because of part 1, but now I'm glad I didn't pay to see this."
3,"Good,not great","Mortal Kombat Anniliation is not as good as the first mortal kombat,the music and fighting is much better in it,but the actting is horrible and if they would have had the first actors on the second it would have been 5 stars all the way."
2,"Low expectations help this one out, but not much","One thing that this movie does that is an improvement over the previous film is that they keep the story moving. The fight scenes happen along the journey that the characters are taking to stop the merging of the two worlds. This gives a more satisfying story than the first where they just sit around and wait for the next fight to be arranged.That said, the acting is still nothing special and the special effects (especially the early generation CG effects) are laughable. Still, there is plenty of action and that will likely satisfy the target audience: fans of the plotless Mortal Kombat video games series."
1,Poorly made movie.,"Mortal Kombat Annihilation was a poor attempt at a sequel and is one of the worst ever made.MKA takes off immediatley where the first film ended. The bad guys are not honoring the humans victory at the tournament, and they are preparing to invade earth. Once again, it's up to our heros to save the day and prevent the emperor from invading.MKA storyline is bad. They don't leave characters origns to what they were in the game. They killed off the funniest character from the first movie in Johnny Cage. Once again to much is focused on Lu Kang and his quest to be the best. The special effects weren't as good as the first. When the characters do there animality's it's very bad looking.Don't waste your money on the flick. Even if your a hardcore MK fan I can't see you liking this. I got in a promo pack and would never have paid money to have seen it. Don't waste your cash. Trust Me."
3,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,"I remember watching the first Mortal Kombat and then tried to watch this right after. I turned it off within mere minutes of viewing the movie and I really dont know why. It was probably because Raydon was replaced with another actor. However, I saw this movie in a pile of 2/5 dvds and couldnt resist picking it up. I watched it waiting it too suck, I waited, I waited, I waited, and end credits. I dont know the backstory to Mortal Kombat, hell I thought it was just a game. The movie is a fun action film with a few bad speical effects but other then that, it was enjoyable. Not that greatest film ever but really fun. Then again like I said, I could careless what the backstory behind a game is."
1,jax can't fight,"Jax can't fight. Shao Khan is the same height as Raiden. Shao Khan is taking orders. Jade seducing Liu kang looked sleazy. Rain and Ermac served no purpose. Back to Jax, his punchlines were weak from the start.... Flawed Failure!"
3,not bad....,Not bad but they completely forgot mortal kombat II and went right for MK3. This one should have been MK3.
2,Pretty Sad.....,"The special effects were pretty good, but the plot, the acting, and the dialogue was horrible. The first 5 minutes of the movie I was laughing so hard because Motaro and Sheeva looked so cheap! The special effects are the only thing that made this movie ""Mortal Kombat."" Some of the actors did really well, but the parts that were given to them sucked so much, they were probably laughing at themselves. I think this movie should've been a japanimation."
2,Destroy all Expectations,"I'm not really a kid, I just use the kid review so I don't have to get an Amazon account. Anyways, this has to be the worst movie of all time. I must admit that I enjoyed it at the time of its release, being a kid. This movie is packed to the brim with terrible effects, crappy costumes, and a most retarded story. Only 2 out of the 6 main characters were the same actors from the first movie. What's the problem here, you may wonder? They spent too damn much money on the soundtrack. Trying to liscense songs by Megadeth and Rage Against the Machine (now audioslave) should not be exchanged with a shoestring effects budget. THOSE MORONS!!! This movie is good for a few laughs and bringing back memories of the good old days of 1997. If you must buy it, buy it for fun, not content."
3,More plot,"I think this movie had some of the most incredible action I've ever seen, but there is just no plot, all there is is fight after fight."
2,"Good movie, not as good as first Mortal Kombat",Mortal Kombat Annihilation continued the story following Rayden and his young earth warriors. The story line was good but some of the graphics and special effects were a little weird. I would recommend this movie to the lovers of Mortal Kombat but not to veiwers who want to see a movie. END
1,Horrible,I deeply despise this movie.It is the worst movie I have ever laid eyes on.Wash your car rather than watch this movie.
3,This movie is like watching the video game!,"Okay, okay...you people are putting too much emphasis on plot and character development. Keep in mind that this movie was made purely for the ones among us who drop quarter after quarter into the machine this movie was spawned from. Those who play the game already know the characters names, their backgrounds, and their role in the ""plot"" of the video game - all they care to see are the characters brought to life on the big screen. That is what this movie does and on those merits it stands as highly entertaining. If you know nothing about the video game, why would you bother seeing this movie in the first place? And if you are a fan of the video game series, then you will enjoy this movie."
4,A good book,I knew this book before and having been involved with basic design in Landscape Architecture I decided to have it. The book is some older but still have considerations for a transition from hand-work to a digital world. I like it. The copy I purchased through Amazon is in a good condition in terms of price and quality balance. Thank you.
1,One-sided and mis-titled,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this book presents the Israeli side only. The book includes only two pictures of Arab aircraft and in both cases the planes are shown being shot down; there are no pictures of Arab pilots or discussion of the Arab side. I felt duped by buying this book (it was shrink wrapped in the store so I couldn't examine it before the purchase), so I wrote to Osprey about how disappointing it was. They were sympathetic to my dislike of the book and they sent a replacement title. This book is primarily a pilot's personal memoir, not a study or survey of the Arab-Israeli air wars."
1,"Virtually Hot, Plot Decidedly Not!","Charlie Curtis plays the computer virtual game that gains sentience and begins killing off boyfriends both in and out of her virtual world. Despite killing two people at the beginning of the movie, the company obliviously continues developing the program. There's no police invest, no reality in the movie itself (a computer program that can remotely stop brakes from working? -- yeah, right).Pretty bad, cheesy special effects, even for the time. Lots of female nudity, its only redeeming quality, but no story really.Softcore porn at its finest. Charlie Curtis has also appeared on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, per IMDB.Awful film. Not recommended.Awful movie. Subscribe to Playboy instead."
4,Just a tad over campy,"Frank Tashlin's screenplay adapted from the play by George Axelrod (of ""Lord Love a Duck"" 1966 fame) that was adapted from Frank Tashlin's story, answers the question that has been on our mind ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?""Rockwell P. Hunter (Tony Randall) comes up with a plan to save the company he works for (Stayput Lipstick) from going down the tubes, by using a well known movie star that is noted for her kiss, to indorse the product.The movie star (Jayne Mansfield) has plans of her own with will eventually propel Rock in to the limelight from there he may even advance n the company and become a success. And we all know what the big question is.See if you can recognize the huge cast of supporting actors including Barbara Eden"
5,A truly great read,"The plot and how the story line follows through in this book, made for a great read. I enjoyed and absorbed every page and word. Cassie Edwards wrote this from her heart. Her main characters are great. They were so detailed and heart felt to me. I appreciated the endearing way that Ms. Edwards' words made the leader of the Shoshone chief and the pioneering woman in this story come together. Not wishy-washy in the least, or even predictable. A truly great read!!!!!"
1,Just couldn't get into it...,I watched this film for 30 minutes and just couldn't get past its phony pretensions and contrived dialogue. I gave it a pass...
1,Amateurish attempt at depth,"A... mish-mash of styles, coupled with choppy editing, awkward dialogue, and wretched film quality - thoroughly unentertaining.Kietel puts in a decent performance, but Sorvino does her usual dry/wooden bit. The plot's attempts at some sort of metaphysics is meandering and dull. Not worth your time unless you want to see how... a big name cast can fail in an ""art"" movie."
3,healing light by agnes sanford,this copy was listed as a hard copy but came in as a paperback. rest of book was as described by seller.
3,I give it a C + / B-,"First off to all the musicians if you looking for Calvin Rodgers to beast on the drums..this is not that dvd. If you looking for Maurice to beast on the bass... this is not that dvd.They do hold it down though. The look of the dvd well pretty good..Although, the Apollo theatre in Chicago, was too small..it gave you no depth to look at. Singers were excellent, although some of the songs were a bit underdeveloped to me. Promises, Favor and Over and Over feat. Kim Burrell are Hot! I don't regret buying the dvd, but you really have to be feeling Vashawn Mitchell's project to enjoy this... Definatly not messing with Marvin Sapp's dvd ""Thirsty""..but it's ok though."
3,It's okay,"This is an ""okay"" dvd, Vashawn doesnt have alot of stage energy, and his back up singers barely even move throughout the entire dvd. I personally like his music, and would have done better just with the CD instead of the DVD. ""For My Good"", ""Favor"", are my favorite two. Local artist from my church also co wrote some of the music, so I wanted to support this project."
2,Just plain dumb,"This should never be a book. It could maybe be a short story in a magazine, but that would be pushing it"
2,I only bought it because my uncle is in it,"Dick Merrill really is terrible in it, he delivers his lines as though he were reading them off of badly written cue cards. His co-pilot, Jack Lambie (my uncle) is suprisingly natural except for one scene, not that he had any demanding scenes. Hey, they were pilots, not actors.The script is bad, but the acting is ... adequate to good. Now I think about it, the acting was pretty good for 1937."
2,Not for everyone... esp. me,"I have tried BM twice now, and it just does not work for me. I moisturize and use primer, the makeup never looks right. I cannot blend it to match my skin tone, it rests heavy in my pores and makes my skin look ""dirty"". More to the point, it makes a mess in my bathroom. I do love that it is a powder versus a traditional foundation - but that's the only plus for me...as for whatever reason, the makeup irritates my skin a bit upon application (maybe the brushes). Overall, it does not work for me at all and I will be returning it to Sephora. Hope you have better luck!"
1,Not like my normal BareMinerals foundation,"I found this product to be more like plain powder. It didn't have the magnetic properties that the genuine Bare Minerals products do. The seller was more than willing for me to return it, and even reimbursed me for the return shipping."
4,Beats liquid foundation hands down!,"I'll never go back to liquid makeup of any kind! Bare Minerals look terrific and is super easy to apply. Did it actually change my skin? No, but at almost 50 I've gotten more compliments on my skin since I've started using it than I did in my 20's.I was reluctant to try Bare Minerals because frankly it was much more expensive than any makeup I've ever used. Though my skin is oily I've always had healthy, smooth skin. As I've gotten older I found that liquid makeup only made my oily skin oilier and my dry skin flaky. I tried another powder foundation but it looked too powdery and came off on my clothes. I'd made up my mind to try BE when I received the starter kit as a gift and I'm so glad I did. Now anytime I get asked about my skin I go into my sales pitch and I've had several converts! Love this stuff!"
1,Bare Minerals,Wrong shade for me. & I buy it for less other places. I don't know what else to say but it won't submit without more words.
2,NOT FOR MATURE SKIN,"I've used Bare Escentuals products for years - foundation, warmth, glee, mineral veil and blush. It worked well and looked fabulous until I hit 60. Now it sinks into lines and wrinkles and makes me look older. Hard to switch at this age and I'm no makeup artist but tried several high definition liquid foundations - Chanel, Smashbox - and I looked considerably younger. Don't know how true but they say powders make mature skin look older and I believe it. After 20 years hated to give it up but vanity won out and I now use liquid high definition foundation. It's been a good run, Bare Escentuals/Minerals!"
3,Great for the young...but emphasizes large pores and wrinkles,"Great product for young people without large pores or wrinkles. Does not show your face as ""white"" on camers when using the flash compared to other foundations. Unfortunately, like some other reviewers noted, Bare Escentuals does seem to emphasize large pores and wrinkles. I do like their blush (Kiss color). Bare Escentuals worked well for my younger, 24yo sister who has purple acne scars; she put on blemish touch up cream and then used Bare Escentuals as her foundation. We could barely see a single pimple on the photos."
2,BareMinerals,"Packaging is correct, but I'm not sure that it's the same make up. It's very fine and isn't providing as much coverage as the same purchase at Bare Escentuals or Sephora. Will order from Amazon but not from this makeup supplier again."
5,Wonderful!,"Received fast...great price! I have used this product for 12-15 years and this is the best price I have ever seen! Thank you, thank you, thank you! I will be back!"
4,mineral veil powder,"I really love this product. It lasts forever and finishes your makeup wonderfully. I've been using this product for over 11/2 years and just got my second container....so trust me, it is very cost effective. barb"
2,Not like the product I get at the Bare Essentuals Store.,"Arrived very quickly, however, this is nothing like the product that I usually buy at the Bare Essentuals Store. It was powdery with no coverage and tons of sparkles. Maybe it is an old version of the product or fake? Will only be purchasing in store from now on."
5,Great Product,This product was just as promised. I love this foundation because it is so easy to apply and it gives really great coverage. It was shipped in a very timely manner.
3,It's ok,"Product is pretty good, not as good as they say. It does not look airbrushed. If it's hot outside I don't use it, because it runs. If you apply more than one layer it looks very cakey, and it gets all over the bathroom when you apply it. Very messy. The brush bristles also have a tendency to get all over your face when applying. That needs to be corrected. Outside of these issues I like the look. Be careful when selecting your tone, I had to go back, the shades don't quite match up and I have to mix two colors to get my shade. I probably won't buy anymore when it runs out, it's easier just to go to the store."
5,Great!,This is a high quality product. Love the color. Great price. Easy to use. Bare Minerals Foundation is highly recommended!
5,Love it,I love bare minerals. I usually get med beige with a yellow undertone. This med is a pink undertone. I have to mix it with a little of the warm color I have but for the price it was worth it!
4,Bare Minerals Foundation,"I like this product because it evens out my skin tone. Also, it's not heavy and doesn't leave lines like liquid makeup.The only thing I don't like about it is that the powder flies around, leaving a mess on counters and clothing, but it's avoidable."
2,"overrated, expensive","I used this product for about 2 years. I regret it. It wears off in 2 hours and gives me a strange yellow cast to my skin. Since it wears off so fast I was buying very often which became pricey. I LOVE my $12 foundation from Physicians Formula that is mineral based, does not irritate my skin, and last ALL day! Not to mention it's more convenient as I don't have to order it on the internet or go to the special store like I do with bareminerals. Get over the hype. Use what really works!"
1,Fake one,"I use Bare minerals for 3 years now, I really love it. I was thinking that was a really good deal on Amazon, but I can tell that is not the real bare minerals!Bad coverage, even I try to put more on my face, the result is not uniform at all and looks like I don't have any make up on my face. I am very disappointed. I don't recommend to buy it."
1,NOT GOOD!!!!!!!!,Not like any other bare escentuals I have ever had. Not sure it is the real this. Very unhappy!!!!! Think they put something else in the container or it is old. The coverage is not the same.
5,Been using Bare Esdentuals for years,"I recently bought a new container of Bare Escentuals and I realized just how much I love this foundation. I have been using it for about six years now and just love it.I have sensitive skin and absolutely cannot wear liquid or cake foundation. SOme other products actually hurt my skin. I have never experienced any discomfort with BE--ever. It goes on light and stays on.The other issue I always had with foundation is that if I was in a hurry and didn't put it on correctly, everyone could see visible lines on my face. Again, I have never had this issue with BE. It goes on easy and feels like it isn't there.Finally, the other thing I appreciate is that, when I used to wear cream foundation, when I would sweat, it would get on the collar of my blouses. BE is so light, that this never happens."
1,Customer serice and website from hell,"I ordered a starter kit to try the products, and while I thought they were fine, imagine my surprise when 6 weeks later $50 was deducted from my bank account. I emailed customer service and was told that I had joined a regular service, and if I wanted to stop it, I had to go into their website. I have been trying for days to get into the account information unsuccessfully. It says my password is wrong and will not email me the password. I have emailed and called customer service over a dozen times without any assisstance whatsoever.Do not buy this product over the internet. You will regret it. Buy it from a store where they cannot rope you in forever."
3,I really WANT to like it.,"I bought the starter kit after viewing commercial after commerical. One day I saw it at Sephora, and thought that it must be good! I gotta say, I've definitely given it a fair chance. The biggest problem I have with it, is that it is so messy!! Power goes everywhere! And with travel? Ugh. Also, I have dry to combo skin, and I feel that it almost dries my skin out more."
1,too thick and highlights flaws,"I don't recommend this makeup. I am a very youthful looking 32 (no ""fine lines"" yet) and this makeup made my skin look terrible. It's too thick, to start with. I tried applying it with a brush and with a powder puff and neither worked well. It highlighted every small flaw and looked too thick and ""makeup-like"". If you enjoy the look of wearing thick foundation, I guess this product would be good. It created an extra layer which creased as the day wore on, making it look like I had wrinkles where I normally don't. Also, this makeup has a shiny look to it.As an alternative, I recommend one of the ""tinted moisturizer"" type products, which are just a light touch. If you have nice looking skin, but just want an added touch of radiance, this product won't be right for you. It's better suited to the type of women who wear way too much makeup."
1,"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.","I purchased BareMinerals foundation because I was intrigued about all the good things people have said about it. I have dark circles and acne problems that are hard to cover, so I am always willing to try make-up that says it provides good coverage without looking heavy. As soon as I put BareMinerals on, my face started feeling tight and cakey. It was hard to tell where I had put in on already because the coverage is so poor. This foundation does not cover at all like it says it does. It did make my skin look fresh and healthy, but the acne showing through kinda ruined the effect. I would recommend this product to someone who has nothing to cover up, but then why bother wearing foundation at all?"
2,"Loved how it looked, BUT NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.","I absolutely loved how BE looked at a minimal coverage level, but that, for me, was the only positive. (1) It does not last--with or without a primer. I believe that due to infomercials and unhonest selling techniques, we just assume it does and think it's there even when it's not since it's so ""sheer."" (2) It's not sheer and it does look like you're wearing a powder makeup. You're not fooling anyone except yourself while wearing it. I, however, did not wear full coverage, so it gave my face a glow as if I had used a powder highlighter--and I liked that. Full coverage looks hideous. (3) I have sensitive skin and I had an extremely itchy, burning, tightness of the skin allergic reaction to this product. It has taken a week to leave my system and caused my face to turn bright red and peel as if I had sunburn. The negatives definitely outweight the positives for me. Beware for those with sensitive skin!"
1,Poor Coverage,I paid $65 for a bare mineral kit and must say was extremely disappointed with it. The mineral foundation does not offer any coverage and it actually starts to look cakey within an hour of wear. It settles into your pores and any lines you may have. I've recently switched to Youngblood mineral makeup and LOVE IT. It has amazing coverage and lasts 8 hrs without having to apply more. I do not recommend bare minerals and wish I would have known about it's poor performance before I dumped $65 down the drain.
2,Bare Minerals not as promised!,"I am 26 and have always worn sunscreen, I have a fairly good complexion and wanted to try this make-up because I've heard such great things about it. I was very disappointed in the foundation--it settled into fine lines I didn't know existed and was very cake-like and difficult to blend. It did, however, match my light olive complexion which has been difficult to find, but the fine lines/wrinkles were too much; I will be going back to Mary Kay products!"
1,"This review is on the actual item I got, not Bare Minerals .","I'm SO not happy with this purchase. I have been using Bare Minerals for years - that's not the problem. The problem I have is, I bought this as a NEW product, and yes, the TOP seal is not broken. But when this arrived it was in a plastic bag with more product in the BAG than in the CONTAINER. I cannot even get the bottom ""lid"" to stay on, like it wasn't made for this container, making me wonder what exactly is IN the container..is it really Bare Minerals or was it swapped with another product??? I'm SO mad!! I will be returning this product, as I'm not about to find out the hard way if this is REALLY the product I wanted or some knock off chemical laden substitute. This is a complete FAILURE."
2,will not buy again,"Prior to buying this product, I went on the specific company website to read more about it and to make sure I was selecting the right shade for my skin type. However, when I bought the product the shade was too dark for me and did not match at all. Also, I did not like the way the product felt on my skin. I could actually feel it on, it was heavier than the current mineral powder foundation I buy at my local store. I will not buy this again as it did not meet my expectations or deliver what it states it will in the commercials or on-line."
1,Wouldn't buy it again! Even if someone payed me 90 trilion dollars!,"This makeup is horrible! I bought it to cover my breakouts and acne. Ok it covered it for a while... I washed my face every night like I usually do. But i have been noticing that it is make me breakout even MORE! AND it WONT cover any blemishes on my face that this makeup has made my face. I stopped using it for 2 weeks. My acne cleared up. I have used the same face wash for years so I know that it is not the kind of facewash i'm using that is making me breakout. So I am choosing not to buy BM EVER again! It made my face horrid looking! I yet found a different foundation makeup that is better than BareMinerals and does NOT make me breakout! If you would like to try this makeup i have found that has worked for me, E-mail me at: lovelybracelets@aim.com"
5,I love bare minerals!,I used Bare Minerals for a couple of years and then switched to liquid foundation and recently switched back to mineral foundation. I am so happy that I did! I love how natural this looks and feels. My skin has cleared up as a result of this as well. Very happy with this product.
4,Evens out skin and doesn't look like you're wearing makeup,"This is great as a light foundation. It evens out skin tone, and does not look like you're wearing makeup. It is not good at covering up pimples or other more prominent blemishes, however it is not made for that. It is good at setting cover up though. Right after I started using it, I got many compliments on how nice my skin was looking recently."
4,Bare it all!!,"I adore this product and recommend it to all my friends. It's very natural-looking, while still covering up some spots or uneven coloring on your face that you don't want shown!Love it!!"
2,Absurdly small,"I do give this item two stars because it is exactly as described, so shame on me for not realizing how ridiculously small a 5"" x 5"" pan is. I thought that it was a toy! There is not much use for it other than banging someone over the head with it if you are starring in a cartoon."
4,One of the originals in alternate history epics!,I read this book so many years ago but still remember just how exciting and great read it was.An American Indian military man goes into an alternate reality where the Germans are in charge.A must read for action/adventure fans!
4,Awesome!!,"This is a very well-made movie that made me feel a lot of different emotions. Disturbing to think about ""snuff"" films and its great that someone made a good movie revolving around that. Nicholas Cage once again displays his talent as an amazing actor. I am really impressed by this movie and how it made me feel throughout. Unique, creative, thrilling and chilling!!!! I love it!!"
4,Disturbing...,"A much better movie than alot of people think. This is a very ""dark"" thriller. I was surprised at how much it ""got inside my head"", not many movie can effect me emotionally that way. By the end I was as enraged a Cage's character. There are some pretty significant behavioral statements made, especially by ""Machine"" himself. This movie really bordered on NC-17 edge. Personally, I would not let anyone under the age of 18 view it, and there are not very many movies I can say that about. I do recommend seeing it if you think you can handle it."
1,Schumacher - Fooeymacher!,"This guy could ruin Casablanca. He is horrible. Only he could make Cage look like he had just read the script fifteen minutes before the shoot. Schumacher supposedly made a couple of Batman film too. Batman? Ha ha ha. Tim Burton did the only true Batman movies. This guy is just another cheesy Zemeckis clone with an MTV soundtrack and a couple of marquee names. On the plus side, James Gandolfini puts in a really solid performance as usual. There is about four minutes of film worth watching here. Bite me Schumacher. Divide up the bloated budget between three dozen film school grads and let something worth watching be put to film."
2,A REVISION,"Although I was originally impressed by this film, the more I view it (on an excellent DVD, by the way), the more it seems like a self-indulgent, over acted bit of muck.Schumacher, the director, apparently gets his kicks out of brazenly teasing his audience with his moral outrages coupled with plenty S&M sexThe musical score is very unusual and quite impressive though."
2,He can do better,"I am a fan of Nicolas Cage as an actor and Joel Schumacher as a director. BUT...this was just awful. Nick's acting was forced and painful to watch. Especially the phone messages he was leaving... I know he can do better than this (and Snake Eyes)But it's not entirely his fault. The story was full of holes and did not flow well. I guess he did the best with what he was given to work with. I think his pained expressions were more along the lines of ""Why did I get involved with this film?"" rather than disgust over the snuff films. And what about Joaquin Phoenix??? He is great in this movie....just like every movie he is in!"
4,Excellent work by Nic Cage - A film that makes you feel,"I think Nicolas had an outstanding performance, as usual portraying an average man being pulled in by the darkness. He is absolutely the best actor at portraying emotions and making his characters believable and someone we can all relate to. The storyline itself was dark and something we all hope we never have to face in real life. However Joel Schumaker tastefully portrayed what could have been horrifying moments. My only regret in directing is that Joel did not take into account - night blindness. It was filmed in very dark lighting and even my eyes strained to see the images. I was very impressed with Joaquinn Phoenix and his very likable character, a definate boost to the movie. This was a film that provoked thoughts and emotions. It made me rush home, hug my kids and then go on thinking about those lost teenagers - wishing there was something I could do to help. Maybe there is ...that's the beauty of a film like this."
2,"Why remake ""Hardcore""?","Instead of a dogged P.I. bringing some sleazy pornographers up to his level, Cage's character wallows in the mire as he investigates the snuff film. What, we cannot see the snuff film, but we can watch murder by crossbow and pistol-whipping? Starts out well, but quickly nosedives."
2,The critics were right,"I've seen The Wire series recently, if you wonder where I'm coming from.Outside of being very one dimensional and boring, the film leaves too many questions without answering.For example, why could't Cage at least give his wife some HINTS about the kind of case he was involved in?Or why when he found the diary in the toilet didn't he just hand it to the mother?Or why, when Cage parked his car in a really rasty area with lots of grubby and suspicious characters nearby, why didn't he lock his car? I'm from that part of California, and I certainly would have.Or how did Machine know Cage was after him in the house? Cage seemed quiet to me. And where was the mother during all the action? And how did Machine hide in the house so he could restart the record?The movie depends heavily on characters who are evil without real motive. There may be people like that, but they are quite rare. They aren't rare in cliche hack movies like this one, though."
4,"Nice Plot, less predictable than Se7en","Both are from the same writer. While Se7en is a better film overall, with better acting, direction, visual and DVD, I found this plot to more interesting, with a less predictable ending. The DVD is fine, with good video and sound quality, and a nice making-of. Joaquin Phoenix and James Gandolfini are very good."
2,Another Nick Cage bomb.,"This is one of the first DVD's I've rented. The DVD quality is fine, but no matter what source of video is displayed the story comes first! What starts off as an interesting puzzle to be solved by P.I. Cage, ends in an absurd sequence of violence and death that I didn't buy for a second. The relative ease with which Cage finds clues is ridiculous (The diary for instance). As with""Snake Eyes,"" a good 30 minutes, but then the rest of the movie bombs. Cage's acting is also not the greatest AGAIN. His intensity seems so acted and not real. Perhaps the academy should reconsider his award!"
4,ruff snuff,"this film gives such an outward blunt show of the underground world of porn/snuff film industry. nicholas cage gave a great performance ,one of his best works. also if you like james gandolfini,he's plays a really seedy porno company owner whom arranged the girls death.dark and demeaning--this film plucks at your innermost thoughts and puts them in the forefront.a great film.it's a must see."
4,BRUTALLY HONEST : IT ISNT FOR EVERYBODY,"When this film was release in theatres i was very skeptical to see this movie but one day.. I decided to go and see it WOW ! .. This film is certainly not for everyone yes it is dark, gritty, perverted, twisted, demented. Just reading the reviews i can see that alot of the reviewers are missing the point .. That was the intentions of this film we cant be naive dont think that this isnt what's going on in a sick sub-culture such as porno.. My hat off to the director he knew he was taking a big chance in doing this type of film it was a very bold move to even consider..The film just takes a brutual look at this culture any young person female or male even have thoughts about going this route think again if you seen this picture ..Like i said I recommend it if you can stomach it.. This isnt certainly everyone's type of movie"
3,Joaquin changes you ...,"Joaquin Phoenix has a way of stealing movies that don't belong to him.8MM is no exception.Though Nicholas Cage is clearly supposed to be ""the star,"" Phoenix's performance as porn shop clerk Max California far outshines the dour, blank-faced Cage. He gets all the good lines--""It's like a gas station, you pay before you pump!""--and has enough charisma to steal every scene he's in. The rest of 8MM is relentlessly bleak and, by equal turns, bland and overly gruesome.Phoenix even steals the scenes he isn't in because his jokes and offbeat wisdom are sorely missed.It's too bad the movie ended the way it did. California is a character in need of his own movie--a better one."
4,Great Film,"8MM is great in that it holds your attention with suspence for the whole film, and has great emotional impact. It becomes a matter of good vs. evil, and Nicolas Cage realizes that fighting evil is the only way to stop it, while ignoring it lets it proliferate. There is much evil is our society, and the only flaw in this film is that it's example is too blatant. There are many far sutler forms of evil. Anyway the ending is an emotional climax that shouldn't be missed."
2,Starts out okay but gets boring,"I thought this movie was well done. The seedy disturbing images were a bit hard to take, nothing I could relate to. I give this a 3 star rating because of the plot."
4,"It's more than ""just okay"".","Just finished watching the movie. It is actually a fine one, I'd say. The plot is interesting; the acting is good. Though there isn't a cheerful ending, it gives a thoughtful closing. You should watch it alone and at night so you can have a better theatrical mood."
4,An above average thriller,"Upon watching this movie I never knew what a ""snuff"" film was now I know. I must say this movie was a pretty good thriller. This film shows the dark side of the porn industry. Overall a good suspense thriller."
1,Overpraised recording,"I was amazed about the kind of praise heaped on this dvd by some. I've now watched it and am of the view that this is merely a mediocre production. Although there is nothing very wrong with the direction, it is rather boringly done without a single inspiring moment.As regards the singing, Heppner and Eaglen definitely are not well suited to the role. In no way, whether in terms of voice or their understanding of the parts, can they rival the many great interpreters of the past. In fact, Eaglen, in particular, is rather out of sorts in the role of Isolde, and Heppner's performance is lackluster.A disappointing release for me."
3,"Fine singing, poor stage appearance","Few can fault the musicality of these wonderful singers. But both are simply too large to portray (1) a hero and (2) the most beautiful woman in the world. These cows can moo, they just can't trot."
1,A declining pair of lovers,"I am really very disappointed with this DVD release, and in particular the casting of Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner in the title parts.When the two singers first burst into the scene, they showed great promise. However, after singing a few years in roles that are plainly too heavy for them, both suffered a precipitous vocal decline, which is plainly evident on the soundtrack here. Of the two, Eaglen's parlous vocal condition is a greater liability while Heppner can still singing with a little authority once in a while.With the other roles merely competently cast, and that Levine and the Met orchestra are both not on their top form, this release cannot be recommended."
1,Unsatisfactory,"I am greatly disappointed by this DVD. The staging is static to the point of boredom, and the acting is rudimentary. But I am most dissatisfied with the singing, which is less than mediocre. Jane Eaglen, in particular, is a bland and vocally threadbare Isolde, and Heppner seems to be out of sorts here. The Met orchestra isn't on top form either. A missed opportunity."
3,Dated and disappointing,"The special effects were ok, nothing great. They really look amateurish in 2009. The plot was not that interesting and rather predictable. No magic. It really deserved two stars or maybe two and a half, but I was generous and gave it three."
2,The '90s version is much better....,"I didn't really like this movie. I liked the newer ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN (starring Erik von Detten) so much better than this '70s version. I know this is the original, but the '90s version is just so much better. The newer movie just has better actors, a better script, and the filming was done better. The special effects were also better in the '90s version. One question: When will they put the '90s version of ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN out on video?! So if you're thinking about seeing this movie, then don't, because it's kind of boring. Look for the '90s ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN on TV instead."
5,two orphans with magic powers,I liked how there was an adventure. And I like how the kids used their brains to help them escape. It kept my interest up all the way through.
5,Great movie for kids and adults!,This story is about two children who were left behind from another world -- and several more children. The key for them to discover this is a map they possess. A grouchy older man (but warm inside) help them find their way.
1,Singing in the Rain -most excelent,This movie entertains over and over again. The quality of the film on the dvd is great. The extra's on the dvd are well worth it. If you love Gene Kelly this is one you will really treasure.
5,Another story from yesteryear,American in Paris & Singing in the Rain are stories from a time long that no longer exists . . . with sweet music & excellent dance. They are an excellent education for the young & an escape for adults trapped in 60 hour work weeks.
5,The Perfect Picture,"Perhaps Singin' in the Rain is as flawless as it is possible for a movie to be. It is difficult to find fault with what has been called the greatest movie musical of all time. Being written straight for the screen, it is not hampered by the stagey feel that marrs so many film musicals. On the contrary, it is brilliantly cinematic.The cinematography is fluid, enchanting, and memorable; the choreography, impressive and captivating; the musical numbers, exciting; the cast, rarely bettered; and the screenplay, witty and charming. The story takes an introspective and satirical look at Hollywood during the late '20s, the genesis of the sound era. It provides us with an often hilarious snapshot of the studios during a time of change. Singin' in the Rain never runs out of steam; it might be a manual on how to make a film. Pure entertainment."
5,Definitely one of my favourite musicals,"I love this marvellously entertaining piece of film. It is not hilarious, but funny and charming. And the songs are incredible. ALL of them."
4,Must have,My grandkids watch this DVD over and over and over. Now they sing and dance to these time honored songs and routines.
5,Best Musical Ever,"I don't care what most people say, Kelly beats Astaire anyday! This is the favorite muscial of our entire family. The story is original, hilarious, and memorable. Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont is a scream and my children love to nod their heads and mimic her ""No! No! No!"" If you haven't seen this classic yet - DO IT!"
1,VIdeo won't play,"When I got this dvd I put it in my dvd player and it would not play. The dvd player would not read it and said that it is not compatable with machines in this region (the US???). Well, anyway, I got it cheap but could not use it. I think the seller should mention to potential buyers if the videos may or may not work. It was a total waste of my money."
1,wrong dvd version of singing in the rain,"I got it in the mail, a used version of singing in the rain DVD. correct label but would not play in my dvd player. I was informed this was a ""mid east/africa"" version and invited to return for a refund. How did that get into North America??? I'm sure when it was returned it was sent to the next guy who maybe doesn't test them all right away like I do. I've had 4-5 errors like this is less than 2x this many transactions from Amazon, I'm done buying DVD's from them."
5,Singin'in the Rain,Excellent DVD. Classic. Bought for a Christmas gift and could not part with it. Packaged well and shipped promptly.
2,Excellent movie but not widescreen...,"If you dig into the technical details, you'll see that this DVD is ""pan and scan"". Why can't we have this great classic in widescreen DVD?"
5,Can't beat this classic!,"One of my very favorite movies of all time! It has great music, great acting, and a lot of laughs. I enjoyed the added commentary about the making of the movie. I definitely recommend this movie on Blu-ray. Gene Kelly was the master, both in dancing and choreography. He and Debbie Reynolds were perfect together in all their numbers. Donald O'Connor doing ""Make 'Em Laugh"" is worth the price of the movie in itself. Even if it was ""before your time,"" this is a classic and should be seen by everyone. You won't regret it!"
5,Singing In the Rain,"I was so excited to play the movie & the color & sound was great!My whole family enjoyed it especially my Mom who really wanted themovie, but we all truely enjoyed it!"
1,Brightspark ADD and Focus Formula,I am almost finished with both bottles and have not seen an improvement in my 9 year old daughters behavior or attention span. She is very hyper and that hasn't changed either. I have been giving her 6 tablets a day and two doses a day of the focus formula nine drops each dose. Anybody have any suggestions? I know herbal formulas take longer to work so I'm willing to order one more bottle before I give up.
3,Every hero needs a worthy villain,"We get the villain in the second book of the Icewind Dale trilogy as well as a much better, though fairly derivative, plot.Salvatore has improved immensely in this book compared to the weaker Crystal Shard entry. Characterization is a little better as he focuses in on Bruenor and Drizzt, and the plot is much tighter.The best thing about this book is the introduction of the assassin Artemis Entreri. Supremely skilled, coldly calculating, ruthless and utterly evil he is not only the equal of Drizzt in swordsmanship but also in intelligence. A mirror image of Drizzt with pragmatism replacing compassion. With a little bit of the reader's willing sense of disbelief he provides a sense of real peril for our heroes.Some of the side trips, particularly the Harpell's are well done and amusing. The expendable villains are also competently portrayed.Over all a nice improvement over the Crystal Shard, but not yet as good as Dark Elf trilogy."
3,Above Average,"The second book of the Icewind Dale Trilogy sees Bruenor, Drizzit, Wulfgar, and Regis leaving the Dale to search out Bruenor's ancestrial home Mithril Hall. This book suffers a bit since most of the party's major stuggles occur near the end of the book (other than the few days they spend in the Trollmoors). The rest of the book is pretty much forgettable, though it does set up things nicely for the next book (which is quite a bit better)."
5,Excellent!,I would highly recommend this excellent book to any fan of the forgotten realms books or anyone else who just plain likes fantasy!
3,A letdown in the extreme......,"I have to agree with the majority of the other reviewers. I am a massive fan of the merchant/Ivory films, and it is so sad that there will be no further team of this ilk. So I was really looking forward to it.It also has my favourite actor in it....Ralph Fiennes. And as someone else said....he just couldn't connect to his character and I sure couldn't. It felt flat. The relationship between him and ""the countess"" just did not feel real....and seemed to surface until the end.So all in all I was gravely let down. It could have been so much more, and it wasn't!"
2,Two hours!,"It took two hours for Ralph Fiennes whose blindness isn't even noticeable to ask Natasha Richardson who is nothing like a Russian to ""date"" him. OMG. This movie is ridiculous. I can't believe this was a Merchant and Ivory movie because the cinematography was so clumsy. Most of the shots were small screen quality but less interesting and creative than Jerry Bruckheimer produced small screen fare. I'm sure people who are interested in wartime era Shanghai/expat culture will give this movie a scan but for the rest of us, OMG. Ralph Fiennes rarely has chemistry with anyone. I have no idea why he found Natasha Richardson compelling. The costumes were not flattering. This movie was more boring than the not that interesting Naomi Watts in wartime Shanghai movie, The Painted Veil. OMG."
2,Shanghai'd,"Kind of The English Patient meets Empire of the Sun, with super-added pretentious dullness (about Culture, Art, Beauty - you know the drill......)"
1,A Big Fat Yawn!!,"Can't believe all the great reviews for this movie! Geez, with all the glowing reviews, great cast of actors for this movie, and the storyline, I expected more, but was sadly disappointed.The movie is long, boring and annoying. So many times I wanted to stop the movie, but kept watching in hopes it would get better.So many questions left unanswered in this movie.... the characters were so annoying as well in terms of their interaction with each other and their mannerisms."
5,Liberating!,"This is a classic and must be read and part of your library. It is such a refreshing book to read. I was lead on an exhilarating journey through several areas of Europe by an amazing troupe of young souls. The author's talents are splashed throughout from the beginning to the very end. This book is liberating for the soul and would make for a wonderful movie for ""Souls"" of 2000."
5,Best Book for Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide Fans,"For quite a few years, I've been a fan of the Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy books. After reading all the lesser quality books from the library, at an Antiquarian bookstore, I stumbled upon this book that has all of the novels into one collection. With the thickly clothed leather, and gorgeous gold lettering and page edges, this out of print Hitchhiker's Guide is a collectibe, I will treasure forever on a special place in my bookcase."
4,nice timepiece,"This is a nice watch. My only issues with it is that it doesn't have a screw-down crown (it's push-down), and the case and outer edges of the band are brushed rather than shiny like the rest of the watch. But its definitely an attention getter."
1,What a let down...,"I heard so many good things about this movie, I was totally dissapointed. I absolutely hated the movie. There was basically no plot & the movie dragged on forever. It was just two women fighting the whole time- a total waste of time. I just think of all the productive things I could have done instead of wasting my time watching this letdown movie."
2,Failed my 3-M Rating System,"Oh for Lord's sakes. I can love a drama, but not when it hits all my hated M's -- Maudlin, Morose and Morbid. This overwraught sobfest features Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts as mom and stepmom respectively, working together to build a stable environment for the kids under trying circumstances (illness, kids' hostility towards Julia, Julia's busy career, a dad/husband who raises his voice, but can't lift a finger). While the premise is admirable, the result is lots of overacting and overreacting from the usually watchable Sarandon and Roberts. This is not a reason to spend your money -- a renter at most, if ever I saw one."
5,Wonderful!One of My Favs.,"I can not even say how much I love this movie.It is great.It has happiness,sadness,anger.All the classic emotions.It stars Susan Sarandon,Ed Harris,Julia Roberts,Jena Malone,and Liam Alkien.It is about the struggles between a mother and a stepmother.Throwing in the twist of a serious illness.It is just great!!!I love it and it is one of my favorite movies of all time. :)"
1,The word 'boring' comes to mind.,"Let's get one thing straight, I HATE this movie, I will make no attempt to give an un-biased review here. This movie deserves nothing more.Where to start? Well firstly, It features the super hag, Julia Roberts, and as if this wasn't enough, Susan Sarandon is in it aswell.Now if you haven't fainted at the sheer horror of that concept, you will when you realise the dullness of it's plot. Super hag doesn't get on with her boyfriends ex wife, then the ex-wife dies, the end. BORING.After sitting through this painfully bad movie, I had to take a shower to get the stench of bad movie off me. I then had to watch some ninja movies to forget my terrifiying ordeal.This movie was lacking (and went I say lacking, I mean totally viod of)in the most essential aspect of a movie, a** kicking. This movie could've been so much more entertaining if it had robots or pirates.Please do not buy this movie, It's possibly the worse movie ever made."
5,Stepmom DVD,"Purchased this DVD as a christmas gift for a female member of the family. She really enjoys the movie and is glad to finally have it on DVD. Great price, fast shipping."
5,Stepmom,Delivery was as agreed and the dvd was in excellent condition. I will buyfrom this provider again.
4,A wonderful joyous acomplishment,"Stepmom has everything, drama,comedy,and even some suspense. THis is a remarkable mircolous movie. A very touching romantic dramtized movie . With splended acting, and very good story plots, I have to say to the director Chris Columbus this is his finiest achievment since Mrs. Doubtfire."
5,I Love It!,"I loved this movie! It's very touching, it's sad and made me cry at the end, but it does have some funny parts thax to the cute young boy in the movie!) It's basically about a 13 yr old girl and her little brother who dislike their stepmom and, like all, absolutely love their real mom. You watch and see the rest."
3,Kidnapped,It helped my students get a visual to the story we read. They enjoyed it a lot. They even noticed where the video was different from the book.
5,Best bass string value,"If you're looking for decent bass strings and don't want to pay through the nose for 'em, THESE are the ones to get. Just like it says on the packaging, they do have a crisp, punchy tone on the higher octaves and a really good low end on the E string that I really like. For the price, you really can't beat these."
3,Comedy in Space,"I bought this movie for Jorja Fox (Pallas), but I found it to be an entertaining romp through space. It was an old western polished up for the 90's, and I enjoyed it all the way. I also picked up the DVD, and found the additional information to be very helpful. I'd rate the movie higher if it wasn't so formulaic."
4,GOOD BOOK,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK FOR PARENTS THAT ARE INVOLEED WITH PDD OR AUTISIM. THEY HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THOUGHH THAT EVER KID IS DIFFERENT AND WHAT WORK FOR JEREMEY MAY NOT WORK FOR THEM. THE BOOK STARTS OUT A LIITLE SLOW BUT STICK WITH IT.
4,A Slant of Sun,This book was hard to find in the local stores. My daughter needed it for scholl summer reading. the price was right at $0.01 Each. Came quickly and in good condition. will order from this person again
5,"If you love great writing, you'll love this book...","While Beth Kephart writes of the journey she took with her son, and husband, she is a poet at heart. The book is beautifully written and crafted. Yes, it's a story that should give hope to parents with children who need more, perhaps, than other children, but it's also a story of love and devotion, and the journey of a mother who's also a writer. When I began it, I worried it would depress me. Anything but. A lovely, lovely book."
3,"Decent, but not always helpful...","It's almost a ritual now for me when I buy a car; I always pick up a copy of the haynes manual for it as well. As usual, the haynes manual is very good for certain tasks you need to do, but for more complicated problems, and even some of the most common things there are no illustrations to guide you through the process. Sometimes things can be really vague as well, mentioning to simply ""remove <such-and-such> part"" when it's honestly not so simple. Aside from those flaws, the book helped me in many scenarios and is worth the few bucks it costs. I'm going to try out the bentley manual next however as it's much more in depth."
3,THE VIGILANTE FORCE,"Once you accept the premise that a band of vigilante cops is sanctioned by higher authorities, SCARRED CITY is a watchable crime thriller. The stoic Stephen Baldwin does little to heighten his acting persona, but again his laconic often soporific demeanor works in his favor as the cop who finds himself a member of a group of lawmen who take the law into their own hands, ultimately becoming as vile as the perps they are killing. Chazz Palminteri and Tia Carrere are along for the ride, and Carrere shows a fine singing voice in a couple of songs she performs as the typical hooker with a heart of gold. The action scenes are well staged and although the plot itself is Swiss Cheese, it entertains and fulfills what you expect."
1,Very displeased,Would not play on any of my DVD and/or Blue Ray systems! I was thoroughly disappointed because this movie is a classic!
2,Not that great....,"It's worth it just to see sean connery though. He was absolutely the cutest guy ever! It's about a man named Darby O'Gill who is constantly chasing after leperchauns and their gold. I don't think it's a movie kids would enjoy, at least not kids nowdays.It kind of drags in the middle, and the end is kind of scary."
4,Full screen but not a total loss...,"It is true that this release will be ""full screen"", however I believe it is an open matte full screen vs. a pan-and-scan, meaning you will get the full image as seen in theaters, plus a little extra top and bottom. It is also quite possible the director framed his shots with the full-frame in mind, knowing it would be exhibited that way in some venues. More importantly, the TV Special ""I Captured the King of the Lephrecauns"" is listed as an extra feature. Whether we'll be getting the show in its entirety or merely some clips is yet to be seen, but this show was just as entertaining and important as the feature it supports and I hope they have the common sense to include the full hour program."
2,Going all Celtic-- Disney-style,"""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" was Disney's attempt to sweeten and make family-friendly Irish folklore. Sean Connery stars as Michael McBride,a new arrival in a small Irish town coming to take the O'Gill's property. Of course,he falls for Darby's daughter. Don't expect Connery to bring out his 007 charms; Darby O'Gill's daughter is hardly a bikini-clad Bond girl.""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" has a surprisingly complicated (i.e. boring) plot. McBride is the target of evil witchcraft,while Darby is off making deals with Brian,King of the Little People. There's magical mischief galore,along with banshees&pranks.; In the end, true love triumphs. After all,it's Disney.For a children's movie,""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" has a convoluted plot. Sean Connery sings,and there's an attempt to be true to Irish culture. Still, it's a dull movie that deserves to be pinched for not wearing green on St. Patrick's Day. The Little People are short on thrills."
5,One of my all time favorite Disney classics.,Gotta love a good movie involving leprechauns and the simple life of the old Irish traditions! Perfect fun for the whole family. Moving at times and intense at others. Will always be near the top of my list.
5,Buy only in WideScreen format,"Disney is cheating the public with ""standard format"" versions of some GREAT films. Join a group of us who won't buy Disney films unless they're offered in original screen aspect ratio.This is critical for such films as this and In Search of Castaways!"
3,A Classic,"This is definitely a classic and well produced. I don't find that it has a lot of family value, however, it isn't a bad movie either. It's probably a one-time watch movie for me though...."
4,Kill Street Blues...,"MANIAC COP is a wonderful revenge film. Robert Z'Dar is the title character, a shadowy, towering killer who was once an NYPD hero. Is he alive? Dead? Something in between? Tom Atkins (The Fog, Night Of The Creeps) is the officer attempting to find and stop the maniacal man in blue. Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead 1 and 2, Bubba Ho Tep) is a likely suspect. Legendary Richard Roundtree (Shaft) is the police commisioner and William Smith (Invasion Of The Beegirls, Memorial Valley Massacre) is a captain! Larry Cohen's writing shines through this gloomy tale, w/ familar faces from his past work. Not very scary, but fun to watch..."
1,I've Been Had,"I purchased 2 books on nature printing...NATURE PRINTING WITH HERBS,FRUIT AND FLOWERS and NATURE PRINTING 30 PROJECTS ETC.Silly me, I thought these were 2 different books but alas they are the same exact book page for page printed under different titles.Isn't there some kind of protection for customers concerning that...don't get me wrong I love the books but I wasted money...one would have been enough!Elizabeth F. Broberg"
2,Simple thoughts over uninteresting personal problems,"Oe got the Nobel Prize because of his attempts to be filosofical about human nature. This is the way I see it. This book is build over a very simple plot and puts up very simple psykology, which is not seen in real life. Why is it so hard to take responsability for Bird? And why does he long for Africa? And why should we care? Stop whining mr.Oe, try to be a man instead."
3,A thoughtful album at a moment of musical transition.,"In ""Stones"" you can see the tip of the iceberg of what was to come in Diamond's future. He questions himself, and what he stands for as an artist and an individual. Keep in mind it is 1971-72 and ""pop"" music had gone through a phase of non-introspection. ""I am, I said"" is a powerful statement of one man's search for self, after tremendous success. Was he worthy of that success, an emphatic ""YES!"""
4,Another Neil Diamond fan,I was somewhat dissappointed because the CD was not the same as the tape but that is the fault of those that produced it. Quality and delivery of the CD was very good.
3,GlamouresT indeed,"I'm thinking that this Trina isn't very bright. She titles her album ""Glamourest life"" and then on the back cover it look's like she's prostituting herself in the ghetto on a box. The songs aren't very good, but that reason alone knocks it up a couple of stars."
1,Eww,I didnt like any of the songs on this CD. Im glad it was a gift and I didnt pay for it. Trina was really slipping with this album!!
1,Glamorest Life? Is this really a word?,"Someone should have checked the dictionary for the correct usage of the word glamour. GLAMOUR AND TRINA IN THE SAME SENTENCE? Even though Trina's attempt to dress up her image may work with the core fan base, she fails to dress up her lyrics and subject matter on this record.Nothing alluring here folks. Just another airbrushed, female rapper.I would like to know why Kelly Rowland would even agree to sing on this project? Next time, say no!Overall, it doesn't deserve a rating."
5,A commemoration of a great scientist,"Adolphus P. Elkin, in advance for his times, studied the native medicine of Australian aborigenes, and was very appreciated by them as a great shaman: he really tried to merge the two cultures!"
1,Disappointing DVD release,"I've not seen another release of this film; but I received it today, and I am highly disappointed. The transfer is awful, apparent right from the start. Titles are blurry. Scratches and dust are visible. The video compression is muddy. Speed seems off. Dolby 5.1 is okay at best. Strange green colors are visible, most likely from compression. It's odd to see green patches on clothing, etc., in a black and white film. The main discs is only 5.7 GB, so there was clearly no need for 2 discs. All of the remaining extras would have fit. The 2 disc edition is clearly, a marketing gimmic. Avoid purchasing. May be worth renting just for some of the limited extras."
1,"""The Man with the Golden Arm (1956) - Enhanced",TERRIBLE! The video and audio were out-of-sync which is very distracting!Returned the movie and received credit for which we were pleased. Amazon proved to be a reputable business.
1,"Once Daring, Now Giggle-Inducing","""I used to be hooked, Kid. Hooked on candy, so I know how you feel."" I'm paraphrasing slightly, but this is ""The Peddler"" character's attempt to translate the experience of the heroin addict. Huh? It seems as if Preminger was so eager to get his controversial examination of this then ""hot"" subject matter on film that the process and the content took on a supporting role. Where does this movie get its reputation? Where did Sinatra (and I'm otherwise a BIG fan) get a Best Actor nomination? Where do I go to wipe my memory of this embarassingly puerile pap?"
3,A Journalist is Diagnosed with Breast Cancer,In this memoir a journalist writes about her experiences oncediagnosed with breast cancer. She focuses on the medicalchoices she must make along with her advocacy for treatment.There is little examination of her personal feelings about theimpact of having cancer on her life. She coves the surface as-pects of medical care but the book lacks substance about theauthor as a woman with her own personal struggles with thisdisease.
5,"At Long Last -- The Great Mr. Moto, and Peter Lorre!!!","At long last, the people at Fox video are opening the vaults to release the classic Mr. Moto films starring the great Peter Lorre. If Fox is releasing the films in order, the films in the set should be THINK FAST, MR. MOTO (1937), THANK YOU, MR. MOTO (1938), MR. MOTO'S GAMBLE (1938), and MR. MOTO TAKES A CHANCE (1938). Since none of the Moto films have ever been offically released (with the exception of 1939's MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING, for some reason in the public domain), this deluxe DVD debut of the Japanese detective/adventurer is a cause for celebration. Hopefully, Fox will show as much care with this set (and as much care with the set of four Charlie Chan films that are also finally coming out from cold storage) as they did with the recent release of their Laurel and Hardy films, with excellent commentaries, notes, and extras. Please Fox, give us the rest of the Moto films soon!"
4,"Oh, so? A not-so-typical detective","I purchased both collections of Mr. Moto films and have watched the first three movies in the series with great enjoyment. Peter Lorre's depiction of the Japanese importer/detective is quite good. I have been pleasantly surprised to find that the character often reacts or behaves totally unlike his counterparts in other detective films. The extras are okay, though not spectacular. The featurette about Peter Lorre was interesting but would have been better if it had included clips from some of the films mentioned in the story. All in all, I'm very pleased with the Mr. Moto films thus far and look forward to watching the rest of them."
3,Marcos from Bresil was wrong...,"I was very disapointed when I received my shipment as the full tracklist that Marcos from Bresil mentioned was not on the DVD. The previous list of videos, which did not include as many, is the correct one.Please be warned, it is still a good DVD but without an actual interview with Thalia and with some videos missing, it leaves to be desired. :(Thank you,Marc from Canada"
4,A great DVD!,"I think this is a great DVD!, with the most of her hits!; but the only diference is that here in Mexico this DVD only have 17 videos( it doesn't have the remixed versions of ""Mujer latina"" and ""Amor a la mexicana"" also don't include the unrealeased videos ""It's my party"" and ""Nandito Ako""), I also don't know why she didn't included ""Cerca de tí"" video.Well, Never the less is a great DVD!I recomend it very much.You should buy it!"
5,Hilarious!,"This is the funniest movie I've ever seen. I pray Hollywood doesn't try to remake it, for they'd most likely ruin it. I can't remember laughing so hard. My husband and I saw it in the theatre, and we were BOTH screaming with laughter. Later, when it was released on video, we rented it. Amazingly, it was just as funny the second time around, which says a lot. Most comedies are lucky to be funny once. This is one to buy!"
5,Classic!,This is a great classic! It brings back memories from my childhood and I am finally able to share those memories with my children. This movie is priceless!
4,So far so good,"Product arrived in excellent condition. Have installed it and it works great. Will wait to see if it lasts to give it 5 stars. This is a good DIY job if you have basic skills and the right tools. Saved a lot of money compared to getting it done at the dealership, anywhere from $270 - $420.UPDATE: 15 months later, 10,000 miles and counting, and it still runs great"
3,It works,It does what it is suppose to do! I am glad I did get this for the car because when my product came it had an European AC wall charger.
5,"Dee Dee Ramone Classic--Hey, Hey, Hey, Dee Dee WASN'T Home!","I noticed the comment by a woman who was simply disgusted and freaked out by this book...was she expecting Stephen King? ""The Great American Novel""? C'mon, lady, why'd you buy this wacky book to begin with? It's Dee Dee Ramone--what'd you expect? Written as no one else could've done, these chapters, which start out pretty coherent, represent days in the life of Dee Dee Ramone at the creepy old, scuzzy Chelsea. While I believe some of the incidents are real, the majority of the book is Dee Dee's wild and crazy imagination--a lot of it seemingly written at times of withdrawal. Any Dee Dee Ramone fan needs this in their collection. I'll admit, some of it is practically vomit-inducing, but, hey, it's Dee Dee--gotta love him!"
3,Could be one of the stupidest book I ever read.,"Pros: Its written by DeeDee Ramone.Cons: D-U-M-B.I wasn't expecting much, but this is probably the second stupidest book I ever read to completion - it's not even engagingly stupid like the Ramones' lyrics. Picture someone with the mentality of a drug addict combined with that of a 12-year old boy who wants to blow everything up (and you have DeeDee). On the plus side, at least now I can say the dumbest book I've ever read was by one of the Ramones.Before the flaming starts, let me say I like the Ramones, DeeDee was my favorite, and I was not expecting a great work of fiction - but this is just bad.The worst book I ever read was a Mark Twain mystery by Peter Heck."
2,A little too sticky,"I'm not sure what length hair this goes for, but it's a bit too sticky and damp feeling that even other hair wax. Plus, the stick is hard to use."
3,"""Good Enough""","This pool cleaner ""does the job"", but nothing more. It does clean our above ground pool in a 2-3 hour cycle, and about 3 out of 5 times it seems to cover the whole bottom. There are a couple of adjustments that can be made to optimise the coverage, and playing with those has been helpful. (Changing the frequency the direction reverses, and changing how the front wheels turn.)Buyers outside the US/Canada should be aware that it only accepts 120v. I did investigate this prior to purchasing, but the power specs are not mentioned on Amazon nor on iRobot's websites, or in the PDF or actual user manual. Somewhat frustrating. Also frustrating was that an email to the support asking for them to elaborate on the power specs went unanswered.After buying a transformer to allow it to be used in Australia, I am satisfied - but not blown away."
1,Just Aweful,"Would definitely not reccomend this product. It never covers the entire pool and tends to go to deep end. To redirect it, you have to pull the cord and try to make go in a different direction. It is horrible on fine dirt. Basically all it does is pick up leaves at the bottom of the pool and it never once went up the stairs in the pool. The one we got, went dead after 2mths of use, so now we are faced with a nearly $700.00 dinosaur. Not sure how to go about getting it replaced. Think next summer we will just switch to system reccomended by our pool guy. He likes the Polauris system. We didn't choose it, because we were worried about overworking the pool filter, but this thing was a disaster. Anything would be better."
1,junk,"This machine is only effective if your pool is absolutely clean. I read the manual and have tried everything to make it worth it. No matter which filter bag is used, it will clog quickly with leaves or shock residue. You must clean the machine and bag after every use. It runs great if your pool is perfect. Ten average size leaves will stop this machine in its tracks.Why would you need a pool cleaner to clean a clean pool? This is my fourth pool since 1973. Next time I will ask for proof a machine is worth it."
5,Good material in good condition,Received the book quickly. My son is enjoying using the workbook and within a couple of weeks is remembering his short vowel sounds. I'm excited to get to watch him learn to read!
3,confusing information,"1st of all I did not buy this in August but in November. Wasn't aware that the delivery date would be January 2009 till I searched 'state of order'. (could have missed this at time of ordering?) But when I wrote to seller stating it was a Xmas gift, I got a quick reply and the item arrived a few days after. Acceptable but not great condition especially for the price.Thanks."
5,A classic!,"How could anyone possibly go wrong with this one? The DVD came intact (despite the fact that it traveled over fro China). Thanks, would definitely do business again."
3,Arrived as advertised,"This special edition of the DVD arrived in good condition. The movie is not quite the same as I remembered it to be, though. Animation quality has greatly advanced since the 1950s."
1,BEWARE: Korean edition,This DVD is the Korean edition. Pretty misleading on the part of the seller - nowhere in the description does it mention that it's in Korean.
3,Too bad it's not Blu-ray,"I had fond memories of Fantasia on the big screen years ago and wanted to own it when we bought a 60-inch high-definition plasma screen. The movie is still a wonder, but it is not high definition. It loses some of its pizazz because it is standard definition. I enjoyed it, but wish I had waited to see if it makes it to Blu-ray."
3,Not as good as I remember,First off I didn't realize that this DVD was a Korean pressing. Tho what little narration there is is available in English sub-titles. What was surprising to me was how bad most of the drawing is- not up to Disney's usual standard. But I still love the Sorceror's Apprentice and the Dance of the Hours. I can never hear either piece of music with out seeing those images in my minds eye. Another image that stays with me is the fight between T. Rex and stegosaurus in the Rite of Spring.
1,returns available,"For some reason I received the South Korean version of Fantasia so I rewturned it to Amazon. The return went quickly, smoothly and I was more than satisfied that they had helped me clean up a mess I had made...I assume."
4,DTS Problems,What's up with the crackling sound in the left surround speaker when in DTS mode? Am I the only one with this problem?
2,Surprise! Korean version,"I was so excited to share this movie with my son. It has great music, and wonderful animation to go along and to spark the imagination. How bitter was my disappointment when I opened the box to find the cover completely in Korean! My son opened the packaging before I could stop him, and so I put it in the DVD player and hoped against all odds it would be in English. I was sorely disappointed again. Luckily the majority of the movie is music and no dialogue, but it is always a blow when you are expecting one thing and get another. Just be warned this is not the English version, it is Korean."
3,please bring back narrator's original voice for blu-ray,"Although there has been some ediing with the actual visual portion of Fantasia the dubbing of the narrator's voice ruins the vibe of the film. I understand portions of the original dialouge are missing (""newly discoved stuff"") but at least give viewers an option. The new guys voice is nothing like the original. Imagine trying to dub Darth Vador or Yoda's voice? It would be a pretty bad idea. Disney please correct for blu-ray. There is no excuse for not correcting."
3,Cosmicomics,"I don't quite know what I was expecting with this book, but this just wasn't it. I was looking forward to reading this for a while but it just didn't keep me interested. This book definitely has an interesting concept, but apparently that just isn't enough for me. Other people might like it, but it may just take a little work to stay interested. Don't let this review discourage you though; take a chance."
4,Abundance Mentality,"These are paradigm-shifting tapes, you will shift from a scarcity mentality to an abundance mentality. Just when you think there is not enough out there, you will see that there is more than enough."
3,Too Cute,"Michael Keaton is truly funny in this. He never has enough time, so he decides to clone himslef..The clone then clones itself...It gets funnier with each clone! hahah ""Hey Steve..I like Pizza"""
1,The least entertaining book I've ever read! Yay!,"Wow! What a powerful and compelling masterpiece of POINTLESS VIOLENCE. Sure, it's got a plot; sure, it's got a theme; sure, it illustrates without sugar-coating the violence and mental effects of World War II; but aside from that, it's like porn, except with killing instead of sex. I didn't think I could be any further desensitized to violence after Blade II and an extensive series of concentration-camp documentaries, but I guess I was wrong! The trouble with this book is that the shock and horror of rape, murder, torture, animal abuse, etc. ad infinitum paralyzes your thinking processes, masking the theme. This book is a failure of advertising: nice themes, but it can't connect to the reader at ALL. Read Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness instead. This book bites."
4,A Powerful Metaphor,"This 1976 version is an updated version of the 1965 original. It includes an enlighting Afterward by Kosinski.In a series of harrowing misadventures the six-year-old protagonist of this shocking story of survival in WWII Poland endures on wits and luck alone. The scenes are lamentable as indeed they must be to illustrate the horrors associated with war. This story is not meant for the timid as it contains rape, incest, beastiality, and cruelty. The unnamed boy of this account is like the painted bird of Polish folklore and his experiences have so changed him that he is initially reluctant to be reunited with his father and mother at the end of the war."
5,disturbingly beautiful,"wow! the painted bird is the first book i have read that covers such a large spectrum of human emotion and ways society acts. as we go on the adventures of the protagonist, we are confronted with the different sorts of emotions he feels. from sadness, to triumph, from feeling alone, to feeling like a part of something, from shame, to pride, and from love to apathy and wrath, all within a short 200-something page book. the painted bird also reminds us how society rebukes those different from us and how events in a persons life determine who he/she will become. some of the subplots may be disturbing and grotesque, but it all adds to the effectiveness of the theme shining through. overall, the book makes you think and leaves you with a different perception of society than the one you may have had when you turned to the first page."
1,A putrid attempt at macabre storytelling,"I read this book many, many years ago. I have never stopped thinking that it is one of the most gratuitous pieces of fiction I have ever read. It is disturbing. What is also disturbing is that an individual would actually sit down and write it. It is incoherent in its effort to paint a reasonable story. It is a collection of perverted thinking.It was not to long after reading “The Painted Bird” that I read “Last Exit to Brooklyn” by Hubert Selby. There were many similar horrific and inhumane actions in this book but I could at least attempt to understand the basis for the behavior. In Kosinki’s book there was no connection between behavior and reasoning, it is just a putrid attempt at macabre storytelling."
1,Collection of pornographic short clips,"This is a sad excuse for something to be taken seriously. If someone wanted to be jolted by man's insensitivity to man, ""Night"" by Weisel is of much more literary value. This book has none, zero, nada, as value goes. I'm sure that many injustices have occurred, but the author should have stuck to fact. There is no conclusion to his line of writing either, just an ending of his scenes."
2,Over large size for me,I bought this for the lure for Gucci..I did not realise that it was a bit oversize for me..however I liked it.Wear and check it.
4,Excelente,"Great CD! Classic cuban songs with the great, unique ""son"" that only comes from true Cuba. Great alternative to Buena Vista and other more jazzy and played out Cubans artists."
1,the stupidest film ever!,"Don't buy this worthless piece of garbage!not only is it a sham and crock ofbalogna...but the acting is terrible...from the top with the Natasha dfljdfjsall the way to Janne campbell...I mean, were these women ever taught how to act,at all? I suggest not putting your money down for thismovie or even wasting time watching it...It is as boring as looking at your foot."
4,one of the best page turners,"I usually don't like reading books involving politics but this one was different. I finished it in two sittings. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I kind of figured out who ""Angel"" was. The book was a little predictable but I still enjoyed it. I couldn't put it down because I wanted to find out if I was right about the killer and the others involved. I was. I would've given it 10 stars if I was wrong on all counts; then this book would really blow me away! Just a little criticism on the main character...I think Mary should've been a little stronger. There were a few scenes when she seemed too naive, very un-ambassadorish.I haven't read all of Sheldon's book yet but I'm looking forward to it. Is there a sequel to Windmills? From the last chapter, I think there should be. Just hope they don't make a movie of this........"
2,I don't believe it,"The first 50 pages of the book are thrilling, is a murder conspiracy and they made everything to complete their assignment, but when Mary decides to be the ambassador of Romania, the book get boring and boring unless you want to know how an ambassador must behave with everybody everywhere, when the book starts explaining this, you will get lost of the main story that has to many voids, of course as in these kind of books the end is a fairy tale and the epilog is made to keep the story open, sincerely I don't recommend this book, there are many spies books much better than this one."
5,Great Plates,"Received my 2 sets of dinnerware with no broken parts, and really enjoy the simplist beauty of the plates, and the fact that they are so thin, can get more in my cupboard without crowding. These plates were a great buy and even cheaper then from the manufacturer."
4,sooo pretty,"I bought two sets - they're perfect as it's just the bowls, salad plates and dinner plates so I'm not stuck with a bunch of cups and saucers that never get used! the design is sooo pretty - i love that the salad plate has the design over it completely while the bowl and just one little design and the dinner plate just around the edge."
5,Built to last,"Bull in a china shop, that's me. This set is holding up well, haven't dropped one yet *knock on wood* but I have knocked them around a bit. While my other chinaware are getting chipped this set has held up well. What I'm afraid of is the patterns rubbing off through the frequent scrub and wash, so far nothing yet. I enjoy the ""simple"" design, and I like the space providing square but rounded corners. I don't think I can go back to circle plates. You get what you pay for right? Watch it for the price to drop a bit and snatch it up. But if you have the money paying full price for this set is worth it I believe."
5,Great Dishes,"I've had these dishes for a few months. No breaks or scratches, and they are easy to clean. I'd recommend them to anyone who just left home for the first time (like me) and needs a set of dishes."
4,That Darn Cat - with Haley Mills,This movie is a classic. Unfortunately Disney did nottreat it as such when they released it on dvd. It hasnone of the extras that other Disney classics have.There should have been interviews with the stars andinsight into the making of the movie. Fans would havepaid extra for this. It is still good to have it indvd vice vhs.
2,Ok Workout but too much Spiritual Mumbo-Jumbo!!,If you are a very spiritual or new age yoga person you might love this. I am just a modern mommy looking for a yoga workout. The instructors endless banter about being in touch with my primal nature was annoying. Telling me to visualize squatting a in a forest and birthing surrounded by only birds and animals is a terrifying image not a relaxing one. The chanting was bizzare and the tribal dancing downright scary. I was hoping for just some great yoga poses with instruction but I got a video drowning in over the top touchy-feely spiritual junk.
5,I just can't get enough of these guys!,I am continuously amazed. Eiffel has a unique sound that I find myself comming back to over and over again when everything else seems to fail. I hope we well see more of these guys soon.
3,"It's Cute, But Not a Masterpiece","If this is the best that Eiffel 65 can do, I am not impressed. The same instrumentation and voice sampling effects that have an annoying proclivity to show up in every track make this album get old very quickly. It seems like Eiffel 65 was trying to make a hit by incorporating several different music styles into one. The result is this trance/techno/pop-dance blend that doesn't sound too good. The only reason I give this 3 stars is the fact that a few of the songs off this album were kind of fun for about an hour. There are lots of better songs (and artists for that matter) to listen to."
3,Blue,I thought the c.d was ok but it only has one good song on it and that's blue when I get a c.d I like atleast 5 good songs on it so your not reapeting the same song over and over
1,if zero stars were possible...,"it is quite difficult to put the incredible horror i felt when i became aware that ""blue"" was a big hit. the first time i heard it, i couldn't keep myself from cringing at the cheesy eurodance beat/lyrics combo. i hear at least an awful song everyday, so i didn't even entertain the thought that someone in this planet could like it... but i guess some people do.this isn't techno, by the way, it's cheesy eurodance... the kind of stuff that any kid with a groovebox with preprogrammed beats can pull off."
3,Mediocre,"I bought this album with the intention of hearing some thrashing metal. But I was soon disapointed. WTF. After I listened to the song ""Blue"" I wanted to cry emo tears. But then I listen to Move Your Body, I was not upset any longer. It kind of reminds of Korn. WTF. This album seems like some metal, mized with blues and metal-core. They say their pop, but they're not. They are slightly underground sub-industrial-metalthrash. They are not so bad, once you quit listening to them."
2,One good song and nothing else,"I bought this album because I liked the song ""I'm Blue."" However, when I listened to the whole album, I was glad that I bought the album used for $3. The other songs just didn't match up to ""I'm Blue"" and some of them were downright annoying. Though a couple songs on the Europop album have a catchy beat and occasionally ok lyrics, the album isn't worth your money."
1,I skipped over almost every song.,"I really don't like this CD. Every song except Track 1 repeats the exact same line over and over again, making for headache generating proportions. The only reason I bothered giving it any star at all was that I liked the first song."
1,What a dumb CD!,"I do like the song ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)."" When I listened to the other songs on the album, I said ""forget it."" The other songs on this CD are like too computerized and you can't tell what they're saying. This is not real music. Don't waste your money on this CD unless you've listened to it and absolutely love it. I bet you'll be sick of it in no time."
5,Dancing All Night Long,"This is a great dance cd. If you love Eurodance(ATC, Sarina Paris, French Affair) then you will love this"
3,Europop is mediocre,"I heard ""Blue"" on the radio and thought it was catchy, but the other tracks on the CD aren't as good. The album is definitely danceable, but gets a bit repetitive. This was a good effort, but it won't stay in my CD player for long."
5,Amayzing depth and sound compiled with good vocals....,"Okay, I realize most of you are purchasing this disc based soley on track #1 'Blue'. But lets face it, that song gets boring and that annoying mid-song transgression to speaking lyrics in A-minor is not all that melodic.---Dont fear though!, there are tons of other good songs on this disc. In fact, almost every ""odd numbered"" song is very good! My favorite Track #9 'The Edge' is a prime example of the pure Euphoria and sensations of excitement that I like. If you get this disc, listen to Track #9 and picture lots of Women in tight dancewear, a partially fogged dancefloor, lots of bright white spots and flashing stobes for that lightning effect. Track 9 is a must for any ""foam party""! God I love this stuff!"
3,It grows on you...,"Not excellent, but very catchy and quite easy to listen to while driving or in the background at home... Kinda like ATB's Movin' Melodies, it grows on you..."
4,This is da best!,"I gave this 4 stars, only because i havent heard the whole thing! i LOVE blue, and cant wait to hear the rest of the album. im gonna buy this cd, really soon, and if the rest is as good as blue, id recomend it to anyone!"
1,terrible flashlight,"I have not been able to get the flashlight to last more than 60 seconds on the hand-powered generator, no matter how long (I once tried 10 minutes) nor how fast I wind it."
4,Mostly Good - a few flaws,"My 3rd MP3 player (IJam and Rave2200) Good Points: reasonable price with FM mode and memory, good sound quality, remote control allows full control of unit. Minor Flaws: a bit large (compared to the Rave2200), remote a bit bulky and the buttons on remote are somewhat difficult to use (accidental pressing buttons is very easy), mostly plastic parts - not metal as advertised, highest volume level could be louder. CONs:Equalizer is useless, all EQ modes make sound muddy, 3D mode is terrible, huge distortion."
5,The 80's return,"So, everyone knows that if you have seen one Jean Claude Van Damme film you have seen them all. So if you must pick, get this one. From pathetic dancing to crazy training, it's good for more then just one laugh. Oh yeah and of course you have some very good montages featured throughout the film. I also recommend Bloodsport as an equal. Enjoy!"
4,Van Dammes best,"This is a movie where van damme does a good role, and he choregraphs the fights as well. A really good martial arts movie, but it gives a twisted picture of muai thai (Thai boxing), you dont do split kicks and you mostly kick to the legs. Thats not what van damme does. He kicks to the head as usual, and he never uses his knees like a real thai boxer. Otherwise a damn good movie."
1,wrong movie!!!,when i ordered this movie i thought it was the movie with jean claude van damme but instead the seller sent me a movie called kick boxer with actors that are unknowned to me.....very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3,good,"I had brought this for my son when it was televised on t.v. He wanted me to record it, so I did but not very good. I wanted to get this tape for him. I was surprised that I found it in Amazon.Almost any movie you won't be able to find on websites, Amazon.com might have it."
1,Poor presentation,"The quality of the DVD is OK, however the method in which she presents herself, in my opinion, is terrible. Her voice is monotone and it takes her 25 minutes just to begin the first movement. For beginners I strongly suggest finding another DVD"
5,Your Quick Art Sites CD is great!,"I am amazed at how carefully you explain every step. I'm not an artist, my painting is all done with a roller. (My 89-year-old mother does beautiful work with oils and my brother does great work with watercolors -- but not me, I'm an engineer and I'm not artistic.)I bought your CD so I wouldn't have to learn everything the hard way when it comes to putting up some new websites. I am not disappointed. You have done the research for me, now I can get right to building sites that I know will look good and work properly.Jerry Minchey, Asheville, NC"
2,Not Quite What I was Looking For,I purchased this to help with my evaluation and it was not that helpful. Hoping that it might be more useful in the future for other types of writing.
2,Had to destroy it to remove it,"It got stuck on the filter and took Channel-Locks to get it off.I had lubricated the threads, I was very careful to not jam or cross-thread it, I used every grippy trick I knew or could think of to get enough of friction to unscrew the cursed thing and eventually got out the tools to spin it loose. Of course that ruined it, and good riddance!Why on earth B&W; left these smooth and didn't think to machine knurling into these rings so we can all get a grip is a mystery. They really dropped the ball on these.Maybe those specialized, padded, oil-filter removal pliers, might have gotten it off and not destroyed it in the process it, but those are big tools and who's going to carry them into the field?Since I'm not the only one with problems removing the rings, I'll avoid them in the future."
5,Works well for my purposes,I purchased this step-up adapter ring to attach a 72mm 500D Close-up lens to my 70-200L Canon lens (no IS) with a 67mm filter thread size. It has worked well for me. No problems.
5,Read this on a dark and stormy night (but not alone).,Another fabulous thriller by Jeffery Deaver. All of his novels are based on a single premise - keep the reader entertained and involved and Praying for Sleep does just that. Deaver's novels stand out from the pack for many reasons - the well drawn plot lines and characters and the plot twists and turns. This one has an ending that you will never forget. Praying for Sleep will do for dark and stormy nights what Jaws did for the ocean and psycho did for showers. Don't read this one alone....
3,it was ok,"i didn;t really read the whole book..i had to skip a few pages as it was too long and i just wanted to get straight to the point but nevertheless, it was a very good book.. slowly the truth begins to reveal and it was a hell of a surprise.. deaver really is a master story teller and it reminds me of a beautiful mind where there's something that lies between the line, literally...apart from the too long description of stuff, it was a good book"
2,Not his best,"Michael Hurbek is a schizophrenic escapee from a mental hospital, and he's on a mission to find Lis Atcheson, the woman who testified against him in a trial where he was found guilty of a vicious murder. The police, Michael's psychiatrist, a professional dog tracker, and Lis' wiley war vet husband are all trying to stop him, but Michael seems adept at evading them all, leaving behind him a trail of murder and destruction.Somewhat interesting core storyline, although some of the tangents were a little boring. Seemed like Deaver was trying to make this into a more serious novel without success. Characterization didn't do much for me. Acceptable read, but definitely not his best. I recommend his Rhymes and Sachs Bone Collector series as much better"

I recommend his Rhymes and Sachs Bone Collector series as much better!"
1,No need to pray,"If sleep is your aim, this book will do the trick. I usually love Deaver's work and was pleased to find an older title I hadn't read. Good thing I only paid half price at a used book store. I still feel like I spent too much though, since this was one of the dullest and most tedious novels I've ever read. All of the characters are unappealing and the tension is non existent. I hate it when publishers try to make bigger profits by re-releasing early (and often inferior) works by popular authors. Save your money for Deaver's next book."
3,a journey into madness!,"Not up to his usual (ie, the bone collector, etc) but still acceptable. The twists and turns of this novel, had me engrossed in this 'storm' and it's description. The ending, as written, was not expected. A good read."
3,"Check Amazon's ""MSR Universal canister Stand""","Reading the comments on this device made me glad that I bought the MSR Universal Canister Stand -- available at Amazon.com.The MSR model has metal legs and are longer/more stable. The comments on the legs breaking, and that they are plastic are negatives to me.So, I would check out MSR's before buying this one. This one looks like it might be smaller and lighter. List price is cheaper, but the shipping costs completely negate that unless you use one of Amazon's free shipping techniques.I'm not trying to warn anyone away from this one, just be aware of a good alternative. And then take your pick."
4,Beautiful,"Short and easy to read with beautiful illustrations, this is a nice addition to your collection if you are interested in the connections between sounds and visuals."
2,Not realistic.,"While fun to look at, this magazine is not realistic and hard to take seriously. You can get some style tips but the prices for items shown are way more expensive than the average consumer can afford, especially in this economy. I let my subscription run out and won't buy it again."
1,LUCKY mag deceptive and scary subscripton tactics,"Think twice about subcribing to this magazine. After my subscription has ended I decided not to renew (magazine contents has just really turned for the worse) but these people will keep sending invoices that makes it appear you are ""past due"" on paying the subscription and that you have to pay to be in ""good credit standing"". BEWARE! I have read too in the internet about people getting calls from credit collection agency due to these types of invoices; just google it for more info."
3,Confusing,The covers are eye catching and when they do a good issue it's great! However it's been awful for sometime. I'll keep the subscription till expires but they really need a editor to save it. If memory serves me correct they have had quite a few editors and it gets worse.
4,Great way to get new ideas,"This is a great magazine to use when you want to change your wardrobe or just update it. It is fun, informative and always has ways to save money and get the most out of your wardrobe. The only problem I have had is that the outfits they make are overdone. There are to many items put together or there are to many colors, patterens in one outfit, but it gives you an idea of what is possible and gives you the freedom to adjust looks to your own personal style."
2,Not even worth a glace,"Every once in a while I will pick up Lucky magazine and everytime I feel ripped off. The clothing isn't crazy expensive like in Elle or Harper's Bazaar but what they pick for clothing is just not even trendy, its just ugly. I'm all for having an individual clothing style but their items are just not wearable in daily life. And their ""real life"" models have these extravagant jobs that allow them to spend high amounts on clothing and wear tacky shirts. And each one seems to have that faux bowlegged stance when showing off their clothes...I have to admit, their section on shoes and accessories is very good, lots of unique pieces to add to any wardrobe that won't break the bank."
2,Virtually Nothing but Ads,I'm glad my subscription is expiring. I found nothing of use in 12 issues of this magazine. Even the articles seemed suspect like the authors were given a list of products to promote.
2,disappointed,"I just received my last issue of Lucky. Towards the beginning of this issue, there is a full page ad from Diesel. It is a ridiculous ad - one of the reasons I am not renewing my subscription. I have two daughters, 13 and 10 years old. The ad depicts a young woman taking a picture of her private areas with a lion looking on and says something about ""smart has the brains, but stupid has the balls"". I can't believe the message we are sending to young girls with ads like this. Even though, my one little subscription probably won't make a difference, I am going to try to make a stand and not renew. I also won't be buying any Diesel products!"
5,Lucky To Find Lucky!,"I really love this magazine because it not only shows great new products, it also reminds you of old faves. Lucky keeps you up on the trends but also gives you tips for the classics. I've gotten this subscription for my shoppin' loving girlfriends. Makes a great, ""indulgent"" gift that keeps giving all year long."
2,Not for the Girl Next Door,"This magazine is definitely not geared toward the girl next door. The products featured are typically very pricey. Also, it is all about fashion, so if you're not a fashionista, look for another magazine."
2,Far Better Years Ago,This used to be my favorite magazine. I feel that in recent years it has gone down hill in a big way. The back pages used to be filled with offer codes for discounts at all kinds of shops but are now mostly filled with pictures of items you can enter to win. I also feel that this magazine has gotten thinner and thinner. It almost feels like it should be a weekly publication due to it's lack of thickness. There are very few articles anymore. This magazine has become a huge monthly disappointment.
4,If you love to shop,If you love to shop you will love this magazine. It has tons of up to date fashion tips and showcases products that range from affordable to something that is more of a splurge. It also has coupon codes for things that are shown in the magazine. Great great articles as well :)
4,A winding journey through stardom,"For anyone studying the concepts of fame, stardom and the idolization of celebrities, this book is a must read. Fowles' study is an extremely comprehensive examination of how the American public relates to its celebrities, and the services, both mental and emotional, that they provide for us. He also analyzes the difficulties that come with celebrity, those that originate from within as well as those that originate with the public. The one thing I can criticize about this book is its organization. Fowles starts out on one subject-- the compensation stars receive, for example-- and then ends up at drug abuse and death rates. However, this really does not detract from the quality of the research or the material. It was revealing on a personal level too. It made me stop and examine how I idolize certain celebreties myself."
3,Dissappointing but okay.,"I thought Pleasantville would of been 10x better than this - it was really, really boring near the end, at the start is was funny and cool though, so it only JUST earns 3 stars.It stars Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon as 2 teens are are transfeered back to the 50's when fighting over a remote control."
2,Two star - not a Buy.,"This movie deserved two star max. It is NOT entertaining and it is NOT thought-provoking. The movie also try to get some messages about freedom of speech and free thinking across but does not do it well. The movie Big (Starring Tom Hank)is one of my favorite so I bought Pleasantville before I watch it..... big disappointment. I realize that people have different test about movie so I'm gonna give mine for reference..... example : I LIKE : Dead Poet Society, Defending Your Life, Baby Boom, Four Wedding and a Funeral, Ransom, Matrix, Pretty Woman I HATE : Armageddon, Face Off, Con Air I Dislike : You've got mail, My best friend edding, and Pleasantville. I read the comment from viewers below that gave the movie one or two stars before I buy and I thought they were over reacted .... to my regret... I read them again after I watched the movie and find myself agree with much of what they've said. If you have not seen it I'd say you don't miss anything much."
2,I saw it but dont like it.,I actually bought this movie before watching it. BIG MISTAKE! I didnt really enjoy the movie. There was not as much humor in it and it was hard to sit through the whole movie. I would recomend it only if you want to be bored!
5,Multileveled Motion Picture,"Great value DVD with special features, especially noteworthy being the Director's Commentary track.This movie offers a lot to audiences on many levels...from blithe entertainment fare to a deeper ""message"" film; all ingeniously and expertly executed with wonderful performances. Joan Allen is heaven...It might just inspire you to check out some art books and revisit that dog earred copy of ""Huckleberry Finn."""
3,"Great plot, but did they need to destory a 50's family?","Black and white plot was great, story line good Shows whats good and evil about todays life style. Would have been a lot better with out nudes on drugstore windows, not realistic and whats good about distorying a fifty""s family to show how lifes better."
5,very entertaining movie,"I watched this movie whenever it came on cable and I have probably seen it about ten times. Unfortunately, it has not been on STARZ for quite a while. I decided to buy this DVD because I have not seen the movie in a while.Pleasantville is a really interesting movie that I would definitely recommend movie lovers to see. Personally, I think that it was one of the best films to come out during the last five years."
2,this movie was all about symbolism. TO DAMN LONG!,THIS MOVIE HAD IT'S UPS AND DOWNS. IT HAD IT'S FUNNIES AND LAMES. PERSONALLY I THINK THAT THEY COULD HAVE MADE THIS MOVIE A LOT SHORTER JUST BY KEEPING IT A STORY. ABOUT TURNING FROM BLACK AND WHITE TO COLOR BY SHOWING EMOTIONS THAT YOU NEVER DID BEFORE.
2,"Good idea, poor deliverance","About half way through the movie, I turned to my mother and thanked her for renting it- I would have hated to spend the money on it myself.The overwhelming theme of the movie is the need to imbrace change, and the director never misses a chance to hit you over the head with it."
1,way to preachy.,"this was a movie that really should've ended in the first hour. Up to that point it was good, but then sentimentality and really un realistic ideas about what is better in life began creeping in towards the end. Even though it was preaching about the complications in life, and how supposedly so much better they are, it really made the argument seem way to simple. It's not that I didn't appreciate it, but my main problem was how it preached about what was better in real life, but didn't make the charectors EVER seem that real at all. they didn't explore consequences for the charectors actions, as would happen in the real world."
3,Could have been a contender,"Too bad.. one of those movies that could have been something special. Wonderful to see and marvel over the technical aspects but as usual the story left a little to be desired. Would have been better if Pleasantville were a little more (un)realistic. Did the Cleavers ever eat a breakfast like that? I think the old sitcoms had rain once in while also. Some things didn't make much sense to me either, such as why didn't the mob change color after trashing the malt shop, when our hero did after fighting with Whitey? And when exactly did Whitey enter the movie? Maybe I was dozing by then. I'm probably being too picky but I'm tired of seeing movies that look brilliant , but seem to be written or edited with boxing gloves on."
4,A pleasant and colorful reflection about our own values.,"Pleasantville is a motion picture plenty of remarkable qualities: visual effects, art direction, costume design, etc. However, the best quality of this movie is the fact that it is not just a motion picture that makes us laugh at others' values, considered funny or ridiculous by our ethnocentric vision; it concerns a pleasant and colorful cultural impact that makes us reflect about our own values!"
1,Unpleasantville,"A preachy movie created by a left winger who tries to impose his morals, or lack of morals, upon moviegoers. Do you gain color if you have premarital sex or cheat on your spouse? Cast members in this movie did! Apparently the creators think that premarital sex and cheating is okay, too and the colored people are portrayed sympathetically while the black and white people are mindless. Not all the special effects gimmicks can save this preachy, morally deprived movie. Save your money and do not buy this manipulative video."
4,Unfortunately overlooked by the public,"Gary Ross ""Pleasantville"" was released shortly after ""The Truman Show"". Maybe that's the reason why it didn't perform very well at the box office. It also lacks a major movie star like Jim Carrey in the lead. Yet, ""Pleasantville"" deserves attention.Not only is it wonderfully written and acted. It is one of those rare films that adds a visual dimension to the story. Something all films should at least try to achieve. The usage of black-and-white in combination with color gives the director the opportunity for many striking and poetic images.One could argue that the films is sometimes too didactic and obvious in its symbolism, but since this it is intended as a parable, such criticism cannot hurt this film very much. Perhaps this film has cult following on Video and DVD. I hope so."
2,Things are so much better now,"All the positive comments from folks on this blatantly propagandistic film reflect their relief that those bad old 1950s (of which they know virtually nothing) are gone and targeted for terminal mockery, since things are so much better now, what with one out of five babies aborted, a majority of children born out of wedlock, and drug abuse and violence the major concerns of high-school-age kids, instead of all the poodle skirts and silliness of Pleasantville.Wake up and smell the Prozac, lemmings: Technicolor-land is worse than Pleasantville, and no amount of clever revisionism is going to change it.This film is a mendacious little piece of half-ignorant fantasy, and thus nearly perfect entertainment for most contemporary movie-goers, who can't even find Asia on a map, and had to have the SAT dumbed-down to jumpstart their self-esteem."
4,"Great movie, great script, interesting commentary","As a screenwriter, I found this DVD extremely worthwhile. The writer/director/producer does a masterful job of taking a somewhat worn premise and weaving a wonderful story out of it. I was especially impressed with the way each major character traveled along his or her own arc through the story. Gary Ross' commentary is useful and interesting for any screenwriters out there."
4,Just works...,"Building a carrier for a internal Dell laptop, and I thought I needed this part. The carrier came with this already in its package, so this purchases wound up in my 'spares' bin. Appears to be good quality in great packaging. It just wasn't worth the effort to return, so in the spares bin it goes!It does appear to be IDENTICAL to what was delivered in the box for the disk carrier I ordered separately (but at the same time)."
5,Great dishes!,"I just received two sets of these dishes a couple days ago and really love them. The colors are perfect for our house, and I love the durability of the dishes themselves. They are thicker than the original Corelleware but not heavy like my old stoneware dishes! Two mugs were broken in shipment (one from each set), so I do wish they were packed better for shipping purposes. But the dishes themselves are wonderful and I would high recommend them to others. Pretty design, and great for every day use! I'm very pleased with my purchase."
3,With just a bit more pixie dust.......,"A twisted take on a Romeo and Juliet type story that takes place in the greens of Ireland where the shamrocks grow wild and the faeries and leprechauns take care of nature. It's most forbidden for faeries and leprechauns to actually mix, however, so enter the love story. Not quite the Montagues and Capulets, but an adorable version of it. Then there are the humans who are NEVER supposed to actually see the faeries and leprechauns, but somehow do, and we have to start the love story again. A fanciful tale that with perhaps just a bit more faery dust might make an adult read. I think children of ages 8 plus would enjoy. It's just not quite the fantasy that can take an adult places we should all be anyway."
2,Harnessing AutoCad LDD,"I did not care for the book. I did not feel it was written very well. It does not ""read"" well and is difficult to understand and follow the examples. I suppose, it is better than nothing and I keep it around as a reference only. Also, hardly and time is spent on the survey module only 1 example is given on runnning traverses."
5,WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FROM AMAZON. Who knows when it will ship out...,"First off, this IS a great movie.Now, the bad....I placed my order, for this movie, three weeks ago. Amazon's site said it was available and would ship in 24 hours. It STILL hasn't shipped. No explaination from Amazon. The best part is that I can't even cancel the order. My invoice page says ""This item cannot be canceled. We are preparing your order"". It has said this for 3 weeks! It is stuck in limbo. I ordered this for my daughter's birthday. Well, her birthday came and went. She didn't get this movie.Save yourself the headache. Purchase elsewhere."
5,Just as good as I remembered it to be...,"I recently saw this video at the local library and picked it up. I remember watching this as a kids back when it was a new movie. I really thought it was cool, at the time, and figured my own kids were old enough to enjoy it, now. I was right. They enjoyed the movie, I'm I'm glad to see that it has held up pretty well to the test of time. Unlike some sci-fi films, this one isn't ""just for boys,"" and the movie is clean enough to be family safe. Whether or not you've seen it before, I'd recommend this one for a family movie night. It's still as good as I remembered it being."
5,Compliance. A great movie!,"This sci-fi film is a classic eighties movie filled with humour, drama and adventure from start to finish. This is a must see for all ages! The part where the Beach Boys 'I Get Around' is a funny moment.I already have both the UK region 2 Version (widescreen 16.9) and the S. American region 1 Version (Full Screen 4.3) both officially released in these territories already. It's nice that US customers can now enjoy this terrific movie. Though the Region 1 version I have includes the Theatrical trailer as well as other extras. I hope there is a choice between full screen/widescreen options because this movie was filmed in full frame and cropped/matted for theaters/cinemas. So if you are used to the Vhs/tv broadcast versions this is the full screen original print. And will be losing picture from top and bottom for the widescreen release on DVD.Let's hope this US version has loads of extras like audio commentary, featurette etc."
4,This is a very fun movie for Kids...,"We love this movie, as it is geared towards kids from 9 to 12 years old. It is a fun movie. My wife and I saw it years ago and really liked it. It has some pretty neat special effects. It is not a big budget film, just a simple, but fun film. If your kids like aliens and space ships, they will love this movie."
5,memories,i remember this movie from way back from when i was a kid....and its been 15 years and im still looking for the vhs so i can go back and relive that....that is about one of the only movies that i remeber from childhood and i still love it.....i have heard of reviews that it was ok and that its not one of the most memorable movies that we will have...but for me it was one of the top 5 of my childhood....
5,Flight of the Navigator,"This movie is a classic. And you will like it as much as I did, it is on VHS. And it is a long movie and lots of excitement and humor also, and sometimes very funny. They made this movie for all kinds of people, if you like spaceships and about what could happen in the future, this tape is for you. Try it, you well like it as much as I did. I am not going bto tell you what happens, you will have to see it for youeself. I recommened this Classic with JOEY CRAMER. Jim in Ohio"
5,Oddjob!!!,"Someone has been smuggling tons of gold out of Britain and into secret vaults in Switzerland. But how? The Treasury calls on James Bond of the British Secret Service to investigate Auric Goldfinger, a former pawnbroker who travels with a chauffeur-and human weapon-named Oddjob. Tracking Goldfinger across two continents, Bond stumbles onto the crime of the century, as well as a luscious female crime boss, Ms. Pussy Galore. Ride shotgun with Bond as he drives along a golden chain of danger to the explosive conclusion! Buy this book when it is back in stock! Great 007 book to read! Also, the review I just wrote comes from the hardcover book!"
1,I got the wrong book,"The book came at a decent time, but it took me a while to realize that I was sent the first edition when I purchased the second edition."
4,Excellent source book,"This book spells out the ABC's of the journey you will encounter when seeking healthcare for the elderly.When I first got thi book I put it it away because I was overwhelmed by the amount of information presented. When faced with the realities of our aging parents, and limited options for their care, one can find themselves already overwhelmed by one emotional crisis after another. Trying to navigate our complex healthcare system is an endeavor that really requires a law degree, business degree in health insurance and other college courses dealing with filling out medicaid/medicare forms.However, when I was then confronted with real problems and questions from family, this book provided answers which could be found no where else.Although a bit outdated, this book provides an excellent reference and source book for those faced with healthcare decisions for an elderly family member or relative."
3,Basic strap,I found that it was too long and no real way to take up the extra slack to allow it to hang properly s
2,Doesn't Fit Poulan,"Amazon suggested this when I bought my poulan weed whacker, but it doesn't fit my poulan. I ended up rigging a strip of cloth tied like a sling and that works just fine. Save yourself some time, trouble, and money and do what I did."
5,Great strap!!!,I have been looking for a strap such as this for a while. Tried it today and don't know how I ever used my weedeater without it. Arrived promptly. Very pleased and will order another for a spare.
4,Abstract Sunshine,"Although rough in topic, this is a brave and ambitious project for this young author. He is not constrained by political correctness in providing an honest glimpse into urban life. The lines sometime wander but exudes an emotion rather than a shallow surface picture. As the book progress, the author noticably matures in skill. A notable undertaking by someone who is a college student. I look forward to more in the future from this author."
4,A satisfactory excursion,"1992. A very pleasant trip along the Devon and Cornwall coast, but more for the tourist than the train buff this time out. Photography fine, and two narrators alternate to describe the numerous stops at beachfront points which includes a ferry ride. Very little info on rail equipment but there are some brief scenes with steam locomotives. Nothing can be criticized here but there is nothing particular to praise either. If you like this series this is certainly a worthwhile addition to your collection. Presume this is a tape transfer and if so it has been very well done."
2,It didn't deliver,"I really liked this book's premise, but I'm sad to say it didn't deliver. I was warned that it wasn't a romance, so I read it as erotica. Unfortunately, I found the author's sex scenes lacking and just a notch higher than saying that the characters ""had sex.""Though both the main characters were relatable, I couldn't muster up the energy to actually finish the book and ended my misery when I was up 68% on my Kindle. It was interesting to see the other pets' relationships with their masters and there is a subplot of another master's part ownership of a pet and for some reason, the sex seemed better there than for the two main characters. So, it wasn't like she couldn't write the sex scenes better, she just decided not to. I really didn't like this book, but for making the main characters relatable and real, I'm giving it two stars."
2,so boring,ok so i watched this movie with my grandma and it was so boringi wouldnt want to watch it againi dont know why people are giving it could reviewsi didnt like itits just this man on the ledge of a hotel and he keeps saying hes going to jumpbut doesnt and...........yeahi didnt like it
2,Dont buy this video.......unless........,If you your looking for a video that has a lot of stuff about wrestling today. Then dont buy this video. It has a couple of pictures and stuff but not much. It mostly show footage of past wrestlers that are dead. The story goes from: 1910-1989. I bought this video over a year ago and I only watched it once. Its a pretty bad video unless your intrested in the wrestling back when there was black and white television. Another bad thing is that its over 2 hours long so you cant watch it any time you want you got to plan to watch it and make sure your not doing anything for 3 hours. I hope this helps.
5,Amazingly Painted Illustrations,"This book still engages my kids who can now read it for themselves, ages 6 and 7. We've been reading this at night for at least 3 years, not because we've had any fear of monsters. It may help that I'm an artist and can revel in the imagery and explain the magic that Dean Morrisey exhibits with his paintings. I want one! I love the imagination and the magic of the combined antique toys that make up the Monster Trap....we study it and find new things all the time. Each of my children has a special part that they always point out. This is a fabulous gift and that is how it got into our library. I think there will be a fight between my 2 kids when they become adults and go to claim this for their own library! Get your own!"
2,A bit confusing??,"I was hoping for more in this book. The story gets lost behind all of the dialogue. There seems to be too much going on in this book and it lost me and my daughter early on. Additionally, the ending leaves SPOILER ALERT a child surrounded by monsters in bed! Albeit they are cute monsters, it just had me perplexed. The title of the book and the premise behind it was a Monster trap. But the monsters are everywhere except trapped! And, we just couldn't make heads or tails as to what they were (machines in the grandpa's shop, toys, or monsters). I thought it was very confusing and just a bit too strange for my taste."
5,The begging of a great story,I found this book in my school libary and then later found the others at the town Libary. I have been looking for this book and the other 5 for 2 years the closest I came was ordering them from a used book store for $25 each. but luckly I found them here.
1,Hated this movie!,This was a horrible movie. There was so much that needed to be explained that they never got to in this movie. All this movie is basicly is kissing. A waste. I would've smashed this DVD if it was mine.
3,A little damaged,"The pan can be used to bake small cakes, breads, or cookies and candy. My only problem is that the pan arrived a little bend and badly scratched surface. The material feels really cheap too."
3,Good Not Outstanding,"This is worth watching to pass time but it is not one of the greatest movies. A beautiful model is murdered (Jean Peters, once married to Howard Hughes in real life). Her sister and one of her friends join forces to find the murderer. The case detective rasies more questions than he solves..."
2,Low budget/Low Interest,"I enjoyed "" I wake up screaming"", but this one reeks Low Budget from the settings to the entire cast. All were good character actors but I don't consider any of them the lead man or woman of a movie. All dialogue seemed so trite and boring that I got restless watching it and only finished about half of it. I love noir movies but I don't consider this one of the good ones."
1,In-Stock is a lie!!!!!!!,"I tried to order this item twice during the 2006 holiday season and was assured by Amazon that it would be shipped in 1-2 days, only to be told later that it was out of stock and would not ship at all. Amazon, you need to police your vendors more!!!"
3,Kingston 512 MB Data Traveller,No problems with USB memory storage. I would have ordered more if they did not have to be packaged and shipped seperately.
5,Exceptional!!!!,"I have recieved this product two days ago. What a product and a awesome price too. I'm liking it.All I had to do was to put it in one of my USB ports and let the computer do the rest. Easy installation, fast and ready to go.You can not go wrong with this product."
5,great read!,"Dr. Stevens tells stories from the mission field of Tenwik Hospital in Africa. His stories are riveting, but they are used as illustrations of spiritual truths. I read the book aloud to my family, and we were all fascinated. The book is true to the Bible and vivid because of the life stories from Dr. Stevens' medical experience."
5,A awesome book,"This book well worth it for any Christian, but a must for any Christian looking to go into the medical field."
3,"Well written, good photography, super ending","It's nice to get a break from the Hollywood Blockbusters once and a while. I read about this film in the Hollywood Reporter; this film was shot for less than a quarter of a million dollars. That's an inde!The film isn't extremely unique, nor does it have the best acting of all time. What it does have is a group of talented people who took an idea that has been done a million times and did it better than most in recent memory. I stongly believe it's under-rated.The Director, Milloy, is definately going somewhere--he's got talent!"
4,Virtuoso mess,"This film is an extremely well-made mess, hilarious in its performances and outlook. I really enjoyed its bizarre nature. Oliver Stoned!"
2,**,"I heard Oliver Stone promoting this film on NPR. He said, ""I share certain traits of Nixon's."" When the interviewer asked Stone to name one of those traits, Stone said, ""Paranoia."" That admission kind of sums up everything that's wrong with this and all of Oliver Stone's films. They are filled with paranoia. Reality-marring paranoia. Well, at least he admits to his paranoia. But too bad he has to splash it up on movie screens."
1,a vulgar caricature,"This is a vulgar caricature. Nixon was a contemptible individual, but he was not a clown or a madman, and no serious self-respecting historian has the right to misrepresent him as such. This movie is obscene."
1,bogus!!,"totally bogus. The DVD is setup for ""DIFFERENT REGION"" nad won't even play on any of my DVD players. Hate it and won't buy another thing on Amazon!"
3,Collected Ghost Stories,"The stories are all set in the 1800s and quite detailed. Too much detail if you are reading to retell the story to a group, but OK for entertainment reading."
4,Maravilhoso,This artist really lightens my day. I appreciate the smooth rythms and great messages that are contained in this album. It is worth your time.
3,Picture book,I thought this book would at least alittle bit of stories in it. It is just pictures with caption below it.
4,Vapid? No. Well done!,"If you're looking for a documentary style performance and exact quotes, this may not be the movie for you. But if you're looking for a movie that explores the tremendous weight and mind splitting moral dilemmas that were at the heart of the Manhattan Project, I think you'll really be entertained by this movie."
5,Fantastic piece of samba-forro-rock,"These guys are incredible and around 74 more incredible they were. They mix roots lyrics with more twisted ones, and the same for the music, they can samba and forro like any master but they mix it with rock, 70's rock that make sometimes you feel that you're listening to a prog band having holidays in Brazil. The guitar players are amazing, world top and the voices (Man and women) reach highs of harmony that remind me of Jefferson Airplane (but tropical obviously) sometimes. A must have. Also check out Baianos F.C , it's incredible too."
3,A step in the right direction,"This movie length version of the Justice League is a step in the right direction toward giving comic enthusiasts a more realistic rendering of traditional comic based heroes and situations. It's not 'The Dark Knight Returns' yet. And there are the usual inexorable plot complications that befall this genre. But there are moments when the writing works, where scenarios are thought out and come to acceptable, logical conclusions. It doesn't give it away to say that the good guys win but there are some pleasant surprises within. And don't spend to much on this DVD if you can avoid it. Watch your friend's or co-worker's copy while you're waiting till it's dirt cheap before you buy."
4,New Frontier,"Great movie. Not quite an accurate adaptation of the comic, but close enough - and it did succeed in capturing the look and feel of Darwyn Cooke style."
4,Justice for The New Frontier,"Justice League: The New Frontier is a good representation of the original Cooke story, but I think it could have benefited from a longer running time and less emphasis on Hal Jordan."
1,WORST ANIMATED VIDEO EVER!!!!!,"Don't waste your money on this - it is awful! They turned Wonder Woman into Big Barda, Green Lantern into a pacifist and Superman and Batman into pale ghosts of their original comic book personas. They have Senator McCarthy persecuting Flash because he wears red - ridiculous. And, they top the whole thing off with portraying the very late kennedy as the god of all gods and savior to both superheroes and the little people. In a word: Ridiculous."
2,Great cast. Weak story. Weaker Animation.,"Lucy Lawless is a great talent for genre films. In general, there is some great voice direction and acting. The music composer did a great job with moving the film forward. It is too bad that these voices and music are giving life to a story with no ""center"". The subtext has a good morality play for our times, but this is lost among the mess. The saddest part is the lack of quality control on the animation. In one scene some detectives looked like they had no waists. My kids do better (they are young animators themselves). They consistently got things as basic as Superman's uniform wrong. A travesty. Hopefully they didn't spend much money on this...because there are soooo many more worthy projects.Justice League - The New Frontier (Two-Disc Special Edition)"
5,Saved by the Extras,"The movie itself was nicely done and it shows the origins of green lantern, Martian Manhunter and others. My main complaint is thats the movie is a bit on the short-side, about 75 mins, and at times it feels like they are rushing the story along.I give the movie itself about 3 1/2 stars (maybe 4 on a good day), but what really saves this product is the extras, 2 commentaries, a very well done history of the Justice league(and pretty much superhero comics in general), 3 entire episodes of Justice League Unlimited, and an in depth sneak peek at the upcoming release of Batman: Gotham Knight.Overall its a good movie packed with some great extras and it's a must have for fans of the DC universe."
2,Justice League New Frontier,JL New Frontier seemed liked it was a rushed project. It was very vague. No backround was given on the bad guy(s).
2,Borriing,"Lifeless, dull, boring and done before? If those words entice you then go ahead and buy this. Really this was just a bad idea that actually came out worse that I had thought it would. The original graphic novel is among the most overrated comics that I can recall. Its a tired, boring formula of going back reintroducing everyone in a different era with slight differences tossed in. Here you have literally no character development and just an empty headed mass villain mess for them to fight.I do like the way they did Wonder Woman and the Martian Manhunter but other than that the other guys are the same more or less (read less). The voice overs are not very good and the choices (outside of WW and MM which are both great) are nothing to write home about.They need to dig deeper and find better works to adapt or these direct to DVD movies will unfortunately die a quick death. They could have and should have done a lot better than this."
3,Extras are nice,"The movie itself, I felt suffered from the lack of an interesting enemy. Too misc & undefined.The history in the bonus section was interesting or it would be a 2 star movie from me."
3,Save Some Money,"If you have your heart set on purchasing this original DC Comics film do yourself a favor and purchase the single disc to save yourself a little bit of money. The single disc includes the movie and all of the bonus features that interested me, including a short docu on the comic book history of the Justice League, audio commentary and a preview of the upcoming Batman animated feature: Gotham Knight."
2,Not appropriate for small children,"I grew up watching cartoons like batman, superman, wonder woman, etc. So when my three year old son begged me to buy the video, I did. Things must have changed since I grew up. I thought the target audience of these cartoons were kids. I was shocked when I heard my son say ""mommy the lady say 'Son of a bitch'"". I watched the video and couldn't believe that type of language would be in a superhero cartoon. Well now I am trying to remove this new word from my child's vocabulary."
1,this guy need to know what he's talking about,yes he has no idea what he's talking about and reader from florida can you say poser thats what you are and ye si am christian Catholic the real one
5,A crafter's dream book.,"It's always nice to be able to add a little personality to your crafts and this book will help you to do that. It's easy to adapt to your skill-level: you can trace, enlarge/copy, or freehand draw any of the designs presented to use on just about any type of craft that you can think of. Of course, the primary thought would be for scrapbooking, but inside the front cover, the author lists 99 places that you could potentially use these sayings and clipart. In fact, included are a few projects for flower pots and a cross-stitching guide for five alphabets. If you're motivated enough, you can enlarge some of the art and use them for paper-piecing in your scrapbooks. Some topics: babies, country, school, Christmas, pets, and fishing/golf...and there are many more!"
2,Way too noisy!!,"I'm curious to know what kind of noise level the reviewers that rated this unit as quite consider what real quite is. Unless my unit was unusually noisy. this is the noisiest humidifier I've ever owned. The noise level was intolerable; especially for a bedroom. I had to rerun it after 1 nights use. Too noisy. I've had several ""quite"" humidifiers over the years -- this unit is definitely not qualified to fall into that category. I can't comment on the other qualities of the unit like humidification, as I didn't have it long enough. However, the tank size is nice and big, and easy to fill."
1,Not 4 gallons........,I wanted to get a humidifier that I didn't have to keep filling up everyday. Well the description said 4 gallons! and I modified my search for 4+ gallon capacity . I only hold 1 gallon of water and now....great I have to fill it 2 or 3 times a day. Not happy... I think I should return it. and get the 99$ Honeywell instead.
2,Cool vs Hot,"Bought as a replacement for a Honeywell ""QuickSteam"" model as the water container had cracked and then leaked. HCM645 is labeled as ""QuietCare"" Cool Mist, but the fan is very loud at all speeds. Also seems to vaporize about half the water the ""Quicksteam"" model did. The good news is that the water container is the same for both, so I now can use it on the older ""QuickSteam"" model."
1,Not satisfied,"I've been using this product for years. This is the first time I buy it at Amazon. I was surprised when I poured it onto my hands. It's like water!!! Never happened to me before. In all the years that I've been using it. I don't understand?! Same brand, same type. Not satisfied at all."
1,FAKE PRODUCT,"i bought this biosilk recently. I have purchased biosilk from the beauty supply store in town MANY times. I have used the real Biosilk on my hair many many times. This time, i bought it from amazon thinking the price was good. Having this product for about a month now, i finally opened it. I dont think the fact that i had it for a month should affect the product at all. this product is like WATER. it is NOT the real biosilk, OR it is terribly watered down. In any case it is not what the REAL BIOSILK is at all. the REAL Biosilk is very thick and viscous. It is slippery and leaves a coating on your hands when poured. This product is like water. something is WRONG please learn from me and buy the real Biosilk in a store to ensure you are buying the real thing. Cant believe there are really ""fake"" hair products, but apparently you learn something new every day."
4,great product,works excellent!! I never felt my hair so smooth before using this product. could be used as heat resistant serum for hair before blow drying or ironing.
2,Unsatisfied with product,"I love the Biosilk Silk Therapy, however on this order I did not receive it (i left word and never received a call back). It was substituted with another product - Chi. It was not what I had ordered so I am not excited about the product"
5,leaves your hair silky and smooth without weighing it down,"I love this product. I don't like to use gels, sprays or any hair product usually, because they weigh my hair down. BUT biosilk is light and not greasy at all. It's smooth and I feel like it really controls frizz and leaves my hair soft and it smells great. A little goes a long way so the bottle can last a while. Great product!"
1,OMG,i gat this product and i compare with mine before i usedbut i is not real it is fake!!! it have too much alcohol smell!!!i naver don't want buy here --
4,"Great for dry, frizzy hair","I love this stuff. I really like the smell. It's pretty strong at first, but it dissipates fast, too, so I don't worry about it clashing with my perfume.My hair is colored, curly, can get dry on the ends and frizzes like crazy in the humidity. I put this on before I dry my hair and sometimes smooth a little more over it afterwards.Use just a little--my hair is very thick & anything over a quarter-sized dollop is too much. Use too much & you'll end up with greasy-looking hair. Also, rub into your hands & then smooth onto your hair--if you dump this directly onto your hair, you'll have a greasy spot. You will also have to wash your hands after using it. Which is no problem if you use it at home. If you plan on using it on the go during the day, take wipes, too.I've priced this locally at several stores & this price is cheaper by $1 to $3.I've got it on auto-delivery!"
5,"expensive, but does last forever","You have to use just a litte, and that's what is perfect, because you will have the same bottle forever. I just love this stuff. It smells good, makes your hair smell good, but does not weight it down or look dirty.It's still the best thing too if you are using a flat iron."
1,Seemed tampered with,"I have used Biosilk Silk Therapy for YEARS and this seems like it had been diluted or tampered with. It came with a piece of tape across the top, no expiration date (which the past few bottles I have purchased at a salon did have) and is much thinner than this product is supposed to be. Probably why it was so much cheaper than at a salon. I guess it is a reminder that you get what you pay for."
4,Biosilk,I think this stuff is a great product. It certainly keeps the hair under control. You have to be careful not to use too much though or it mats your hair down.
5,Great product and price,"I love this product for my hair! It provides the moisture that I need for my hair without greasy build-up. Thankfully, this seller provided it at a much more affordable price!"
5,loved it!!!,It leaves my hair shinny and not greasy at all. I absolutely love it... Oh and if you must know I have African American hair..
1,Fake,"This item is fake. It looks like someone took real biosilk therapy and added 3/4 of alcohol. We know that ethanol actually dries hair so I wouldn't recommend using it. I just bough real stuff in the store and it's like it should be - thick and smelling of roses with no ethanol.The original company making the product warns again counterfeits, and this is one of those.Don't buy it!"
4,"more fun, less conventional","I liked this guide alot. When I studied in Europe even though I was there for months I usually spent my time with other Americans, drinking too much beer and talking about American things. Which I could have done in Philly. This guide includes alot of places that the average tourist will probably never find on their own, more unique and the 'real' stuff of Europe. It was also easy to read and kind of funny. I would highly recommend it."
2,Also Disappointed,"The video quality is passable, but the sound is muddied and is often marred by low frequency rumbles from wind hitting the microphone. You'd be better off listening to a crashing waves CD and closing your eyes."
3,more an ep than a cd single,"This is more of a live ep than a cd single for ""Build a Fire."" It contains three live versions of songs from their legendary 1991 show at Six Flags over Georgia. All three are solid, but ""Wild Dog Moon"" is the best."
2,You said that before. A few times,"Although rich in description and detail (and complete with many wonderful images) the writing was, at times, rather poor. Worse, it was repetitive. The author described a scene in a film in the chapter ""The Artist,"" and then described it in the same way in the chapter specifically dedicated to that film. THEN, if the scene was similar to one in another film, the author felt the need to describe it once more, as if the reader were too stupid to remember. Additionally, he often made a scant reference to piece of information that could have added to the topic being examined, but instead of briefly detailing it, he simply mentioned that it was available in another book. (This might have been excusable once, but he did this multiple times!) He was dedicated to his subject, having quoted interviews he conducted, etc, but the book would have been much better if he had been even half as devoted to the reader."
4,excellent,I enjoyed all of Clark Cable's movies. They don't make men like that anymore it's a delight to see them reproduced.
5,Nothing like an old western and a bowl of popcorn!,"I remember watching these movies with my Grandfather, brings a smile to my face just thinking about it. Give it go, make a memory and a smile."
1,Ridiculous Book,"I bought this book thinking that while I don't think he's the world's greatest horror novel writer, he has good ""punchline ideas"" and that short stories would be perfect for him. Unfortunately I'm very dissapointed. What it comes down to is that a large portion of the stories make no sense! They wander here and there and taper off to an ending that's not really an ending. I feel like he took general ideas, made them as gruesome and possible and felt no need to actually base them around a real story. They honestly make no sense some of them. A total waste of money."
3,Inconsistent but some are great,"Several stories in here are pretty good. The one that stands above the others in scare factor is ""Comes the Bad Time"". I can barely type the title without getting goose bumps. Something about this story really scared the #$*@ out of me.Its worth buying just for this story alone."
1,Don't Bother,"How disappointing! For a Bentley Little fan, this book left much to be desired. After reading The Store, and The Return I figured just about anything he wrote should be golden - not true. Mediocre stories - not scary, not particularly horror filled, or even interesting - some plain flat out stupid! I would not recommend this book even to the most die-hard fan!"
1,Sickening,"The first story in this collection was enough to nauseate me. A young boy is murdered by having a shovel blade jammed in his back--sick enough for you? If you're the type of creep who enjoys ""writing"" like that, this is the book for you. If you're part of the 99.9% of humanity that would be repelled by stories such as this, save your money.For a decent horror collection that won't make you want to throw up, get Stephen King's ""Night Shift"" instead."
1,"One star, but only because I had to","I had actually read 3 of Little's novels previously - The Walking (pretty cool), The House (eh),and Dominion (Cheesy but readable). I was not a Little fan, but I could read him in a pinch. His style is mildly irritating (stilted, but readable), and his gratuitousness seems to know no bounds (Dominion, especially). But this collection has actually made me opposed to Little and his work on a cosmic level. I read this directly after reading ""Everything's Eventual"" and I can only compare the juxtaposition of experience to be like listening to a Britney Spears CD on the heals of listening to the Beatles. I have no idea why this man gets such high praise. It reminds me of horror written by someone who has seen Killer Klowns a thousand times, but has never read The Shining. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad. The plots are not just ridiculous, but someone needs to tell him that every quirky idea that enters the brain is not necessarily a good idea for a story."
3,Pretty Good; Perfect For Backyard Wars,(CAUTION THIS GUN JAMS AND IS EASILY BROKEN) I bought this gun from my moms account soo here it goes. This Gun is pretty good. The laser sight broke in 2 hours so I ended up just snipping all the wires out and it worked out to be a perfect cover for were the bb's go in. The FPS is pretty good and with the hop up you can make it go pretty far. The pump works good but pumping it more than once isn't the best idea. So this is a pretty good gun for either a cheap sidearm or for backyard wars.Pros-Good FPSSmooth Pump ActionLightweightNice FeelRealisticIron Sight AccurateGreat For Begginers!Cons-Cheap (You get what you pay for)Laser Sight InaccurateMag is FakeBB's Slide Out of TopScope SucksOverall its good!
1,Recycled,"This is just a blatant pirating of the Clash's ""Rock the Casbah."" There's no originality here. It's easy to make a song by using an old one. Check out the original for a better tune."
2,Don't Recommend,"I really get put off by bad language and use of four letter words in my reading. When I find them in the first three or four chapters I put the book in the ""cloud"" of my kindle and never finish it."
5,"""Hayley Mills is great in 'Pollyanna'""","Hayley Mills in her first Disney movie ever. In ""Pollyanna"", she plays a 12-year old orphan who comes to Harrington Town to stay with her aunt Polly (Jane Wyman). The whole town needs some happiness,so Pollyanna invents ""The Glad Game"" to make everyone fell better. Hayley sings a delightful version of ""America The Beautiful"" in the scene where all the girls dress up as the American flag. Hayley Mills won an Academy Award for her performance as Pollyanna. This movie is fun for the whole family to enjoy!"
3,Classic,How can you give a classic (especially disney)a bad rating. The only reason I did not give this a 5 is because it does not play properly. It will not load and freezes about every 20 minutes. Making more problems then it is worth.
4,Movie,Good classic family movie and my 94 yr old mother had never seen it. Plan to recommend it to others with older family in the house.
1,Fur falls out!,"When we left squirrel on leather couch overnight, 10% of the tiny furs were all over the couch!My dad got so mad, he threw away the squirrel within 1 day! I wasted my money!"
2,premium price but economy packing.,"When you pay $70.00 for a book you expect a premium packing job, it was shipped in envelope and cover was damaged. Very disapointed."
2,"clever but much, much too long; also over-dramatic","clever but much, much too long. . .The plot is clever, with some surprises along the way.One weakness is that it is stretched out and goes on and on, as when itdiscusses the pros and cons of giving in to the kidnappers.Another weakness is the over-acting and over-dramatizing of two overly emotional immature parents."
4,Beautiful Muzak!,"With this set from the Royal Philharmonic, you can't beat the price, the musical selection/sequence or the performance. I've heard some of this music used as break music for NPR's Music of the Night. My favorite selections are the Delius (2 Aquarelles) and Walton (Henry V) pieces. Elgar's peaceful Introduction and Allegro is a satisfying prelude to this collection of worthwhile English string music. Although I find the Purcell finale a little jarring in its forcefulness, the overall feeling culled from this collection of generally one of elegiac and meditative calm. In short, it's Muzak without the cheese.I'm sorry to know that this recording is out of stock. I hope Intersound restocks this item, because I believe many people would agree with me after a few listens: you can't beat the price, the music selection or the performance of these wonderful musical diversions."
5,"Best ABC book for boys, hands down!!!","This is a darling book for active little boys and a fun way to work on learning their ABC's and their sounds. We love this book and it has been a favorite for a couple years now. Each year my son, I have two, takes it to class to have the teacher read out loud and it is the hit of the season. I'd gauge the age range for this book at about 3-5 years. We love it so much we are getting it for each of our friends who have young boys for Christmas. It'd be a great reasonably priced birthday gift as well. The family will thank you for it, I am sure. Amazing illustrations. There are a couple yucky superheros in it, while not being disturbing or violent, that appeal to the ""gross out"" factor in every boy while still keep them working on those letter sounds. Something for everyone! You won't regret it. I just want Mr. McLeod to write a couple more."
4,Art & Spirit,"It's more than watching him work -- altho it's that, too. It's more than hearing him talk about what inspires and moves him -- altho it's that, too. It's more than hearing other people talk about him -- altho it's that, too. It moved quickly and smoothly, and ceraintly didn't feel like an hour and a half"
5,love it,"I was looking forward to this movie, and got it super fast !!! Love the expedient service, and look forward to ordering again"
4,A story for the whole family to enjoy!,"I love this film! I think that financial and parental obligations can cause Christmas to be a very stressful time for many people. The main character, played by Mary Steenburgen, is a very unhappy person. She is obviously in a rut and the fact that another Christmas is coming, with all that entails, is not helping. This is a great story about seeing what you have, instead of what you don't. It is very emotional, as fairy tales are, and has a wonderful moral. It is heartwarming and appeals to the child in all of us. My family and I watch it every year!"
5,Artful Christmas Film,"Director Philip Borsos has devised here a beautiful Christmas card of a holiday movie. It's visually stunning, superbly acted, and ultimately an honest to goodness tearjerker that earns it's tears. It's narrative is ingenious. It follows a down on their heels working class family whose matriarch(Mary Steenburgen) finds it hard to muster the Christmas spirit who only puts on a brave face for the sake of the children. Tragedy strikes on Christmas Eve. Now you would think at this point the film to be a maudlin affair but it's at this point they deliver the promised magic. Steenburgen is terrific as the put upon mother and the incomparable Harry Dean Stanton is wonderful as the Guardian Angel Gideon who is sent to rekindle the wonder of Christmas in Steenburgen. I discovered this film purely by accident and what a wonderful accident that was."
5,Best Christmas movie,"I love this movie - vastly more interesting plot than the average Christmas movie, and a very touching reminder of what's important at Christmas and in life."
4,Nice for the price - under $10,"My expectations were not high considering the $10 price tag, but I desperately needed some duvet covers for my kids beds and did not want to pay a lot. What I received was better than what I expected. The duvet is of decent quality (although I haven't washed it yet), the colors are vibrant and the fabric (while not silk to the touch or anything like that) is soft and comfortable. I'd rate it a good buy.One thing to consider, however, about this duvet cover is that there is NO CLOSURE on one side. In my experience, most duvet covers offer either a button or zipper closer. This one remains completely open. Kind of like a zip lock bag with no zip seal. It would not be very difficult to add buttons and button holes or to add a zipper. I will probably simply sew up about 12 inches on each side to keep the comforter from falling out."
5,Unreal,"This was a purchase I longed for but am now glad I waited and spent the extra $$$. This saw is whisper quiet and a breeze to use. The rails take some time to set up and then cleaning the shipping compound off is a pain but this is the ticket for those who can afford this. The interal integrated casters are worth the price. I use a 2 car wood studio and often need to move around my tools. This saw moves with ease and is easy to level. Packing was great, comes on a skid and I set it up by myself. Directions were easy to follow and other than time it was easy to set up. Cuts 2.5 inch oak without bogging down at all. Love this saw."
2,The Egyptian,"I realize that this DVD is a foreign made DVD and it did state that it had Korean subtitles, but I didn't realize that you CAN'T turn the thing off to ""NO"" subtitle in the menu. It says you can, I switch the thing on ""off"" but the subtitles won't go away. It's very disturbing to try and watch this thing with the bright bold subtitles flashing on the bottom of the screen.The movie itself is an old favorite of mine and the movie quality was good I just don't apprectiate not have the choice of turning of the subtitles.Regina Maxim"
3,"Good movie, poor DVD","This lavish epic, set in the time of the Pharaoh Ikhnaton, is full of corny dialogue and spectacular sets. One of the few vintage Hollywood epics not to be based on a biblical story, it tells the tale of Sinue, an idealistic young physician, his rise, fall, and eventual redemption.Unfortunately, the import DVD currently available is of very poor quality. This is a movie that succeeds based on the terrific sets and vivid production design, and with the poor video quality on this disc the impact is blunted. I first saw this on a cable channel and the broadcast picture was much better than what you'll find on this disc.I'd recommend waiting for a remastered official release; in the meantime, record it from cable if you get the chance."
1,LOosing conscience....,"What the hell are people thinking about when they do accept to shoot a sscript like this? ""Science fiction-terror"" is a genre very difficult to make, so it's not rare to make a total failure. THis is the case. THe production seems like made for cable, the actors seem to have a wish to laugh all the time, the ""metal monsters"" are unconvincing. Well, I liked nothing in it."
4,Surprisingly Enjoyable,"Ignore critics and their superficial taste, and see this nicely filmed, stylishly executed, finely acted sci-fi thriller! July 20! :( Too long to wait."
3,Derivative? But still fun...,"I didn't think it was TOO bad...Yeah, a whole 'nother take on the ""Borg"" story, but maybe the comic book was out first with it. I don't know. It was good action, and that's always worth at least two stars. The one thing that stops me from giving it four stars was the incredible weirdness in having a ship out on the ocean being in contact with the Mir. It was implied that it was the only communication hub for it. What's up with that? Other than that..."
5,Campy fun,"One of those ""so bad it's good"" schlockers. Donald Sutherland especially has a field day chewing up scenery. Buy it for a fun ride."
4,ITS PRETTY GOOD,"Now most people dont like this movie.Why?I thought it was pretty good(nice Special FX)But,I wish that the russian woman could have survived.:)"
5,breathtaking!!!,"Probably one of the greatest books i've ever read about a remarkable woman who had the courage to be different. You really have the feeling you are with her in Africa and just have to read it, it's much better than the film!!!"
3,Lovely but incomplete,"Blixen writes beautifully. It is interesting to note that English was not her native tongue but that she paints with it a beautiful portrait of Kenya between the world wars, its people and its landscapes.But unlike Conrad, another non-native English speaker who wrote of his Colonial-era experiences, Blixen has neither written a book nor really told a story. She begins very well, and beautifully. And her description of the loss of her friend and then her farm are wonderfully and poingnantly done. But the middle of the book is a series of short - often less than a page - vignettes, largely unconnected, many of which are frankly nonsensical.This, very unfortunately, is not a story of her life; she is the autobiographical protagonist but there is no insight into her, her life, her love or even her loss. Nor is it a story of Africa in transition. it starts out to become these things, but it does not succeed.It's a lovely, easy read but it is not history nor is it literature."
5,A Book for Readers,"Others have explained the book well enough. I won't repeat them here.This book is for people who love to read; who love to linger over beautifully written sentences. Dinesen's writing has a beauty, an elegance, that is impossible to describe, but also impossible to ever forget. It is elegantly spare, elegant in its moderate pacing, and elegantly rich. No other author writes like Dinesen (Blixen). Read her to enrich your own life."
4,McEwan does Espionage?,"The Innocent starts out as a meticulously detailed period piece, a marked departure for those readers who are fans of McEwan's previous work. Protagonist Leonard Marnham is a nave new addition to a British-American military intelligence team in Cold War Berlin. Fans of espionage will find lots to like in McEwan's description of tunneling operations, surveillance, and the strange sequence of increasingly restrictive ""top secret"" classifications.McEwan shows his versatility here in depicting Cold War intelligence operations, but even though it consumes half of the novel this is merely staging for what will come. The story eventually (and suddenly) plunges back into familiar McEwan territory of love, sex, and violence as Marnham's relationship with his German lover spins brutally out of control.The Innocent in some ways lacks the complexity of Black Dogs and the subtlety of the Booker Prize winning Amsterdam, but it is immensely readable. An enjoyable novel."
4,Very intriguing read...,This book was sitting on my bookshelf for 2 years...sorry I didn't read it before. Difficult to put down once I picked up.
3,"Good performance, very poor sound quality","This is an excellent live performance of a splendid opera. Maria Callas excels as Medea. However, the sound quality is downright poor. When the choir starts to sing, the sound is even severely distorted. Moreover, the audience is very much present. Sometimes you hear as much coughing, and even talking as music, especially during the softer instrumental passages. The audience, too, applauds even before the music ends, in total disrespect for the orchestral performance.In short: this is a recording for lovers of opera singing, and of Maria Callas in particular. If you're one of them, you won't be dissapointed. However, people interested in the opera as a composition and lovers of orchestral sounds should look elsewhere."
4,Alice in--British Production,A work of art...Carol Marsh was Beautiful and talented. Brings back fond memories.....I was in the seventh grade when I saw it in the theater...
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR ANOTHER MOVIE,This was so awful that I did not bother to finish watching it. The film quality was awful. The songs were worst than corny. I am so bummed to have purchased this movie. I was looking for a version I saw when I was a child and this certainly was not it.
3,One of those movies...,"It's one of those movies that stays in your mind for a while... I was in love with this move as a teenager and never forgot it, but most people don't have any idea about this movie. I'd say buy it."
4,Should be part of every tai chi practitioners library.,"This book offers 108 cogent insights into many aspects of Tai Chi. This is NOT a step-by-step training guide and should not be thougth of in that way. There are many training books on the market that address the details of each form. This wonderful book helps you better understand the higher principles of Tai Chi and how to apply them through your ""play.""Every serious Tai Chi practitioner should have a copy of this book in their library. I found this book along with my copy of The Way of the Owl to be great companions. These resources help you to achieve a deeper understanding of our life energy and how it applies to our daily lives."
3,Excellent book - never ending action,"As I live in South Africa , it has been interesting reading Vortex.It is a book that is well written and the action never seems to stop. This book , just like Red Phoenix wouldnot be a dissapointment to anyone."
4,Very handy,"Before I got this bag, toting around my FBV was a bit of a chore. Now I sling it over my shoulder in the bag and I'm off!I only gave it four out of five stars because the interior had a small tear in the lining (about 4"" long, not a show-stopper as far as using the bag goes, but just a fit-and-finish type of quality control thing for me)."
2,low budget/high aspirations,"I have no objectivity. I wrote the script for this movie. It was so much less than it might have been. And yet, Ray Sharkey (in one of his last roles) brought something to the character that no one could write, something deep and tragic that almost saves the film from ""compleat scrap-heap"". Hard to find, and expensive, no video library is complete without it. RVC"
5,Paying it forward in action,"Best selling author Catherine Ryan Hyde, the inspiration behind the Pay it Forward Movement, introduces us to the Kindness Crew, a group of four guys, Val, Brad, Erik and Chris who take a 3 month road trip across Canada. Not your usual 'coming of age' or Thelma and Louise road trip. This is a random acts of kindness tour. What's inspiring about their story is that anyone can do these small kindnesses and make a big difference. If you want a little more happiness in your own life, try some of these small acts. These guys are on a roll and I am eagerly awaiting their next book."
5,Wonderful book.,I strongly recommend this book to improve life. I love this book .People should not forget mind and think of body only.
2,Dead On Arrival,"Another disappointing and flaccid serial killer thriller. Nightwatch never overcomes its genre cliches or matches the visceral intensity of earlier flicks such as Silence of the Lambs or Seven. This, despite a how-can-you-lose mise-en-scene morgue setting, creepy Lynchian details, and normally oddball actors. Instead, it relies on the inherent and cheap titillation of murder itself for any movie excitement-which, if you think about it, leaves a different kind of icky feeling than director Ole Bornedal or screenwriter Steven Soderbergh probably intended.The DVD itself looks and sounds great, especially in the morgue sequences. There are no special features to speak of."
1,Not very good. Disappointing,"I saw a commercial for this on the video for Scream and after seeing all the Children of the Corns (One through five), I rented this. It was REALLY bad. The opening murder was cool and I thought I was going to see a GREAT movie, but I was horribly wrong. The main character tries to act American but his accent keeps breaking, the killer was bad, and all the entertainment value went down the drain. If you rent this for the sake of Patricia Arquette, rent Lost Highway instead."
3,i liked his other album better,"Altho Ray's voice is the best, I liked his other album better....especially songs like ""How Come?"". There were no insightful songs like that on this album. I expected more from him, but he probably doesn't care. LOL He just wants to sing."
2,Not Weirs best,"For some reason, I had a terrible time finishing this book, which is unusual for Weir's books. Normally I can't put them down, but I just got bogged down in Liz's repetitive courtships to be fully engrossed. I know the author's intent was to present a personal history rather than a political one, but the resulting work is uneven, derivitive, and often just dull."
4,Captivating and Well-Researched,"As thorough as any academic biography yet so lively and captivating as to give the reader the sense of living in Elizabethan England, from Elizabeth's perspective as well as that of those who knew her. Chronologically covers the events of her life with scrupulous detail. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
3,Just her personal life,I thought that this book dealt more with Elizabeth personal life and her relationships. It did not highlight her political shrewdness which made her such a fantastic ruler of her times.It could be good read for people who would be interested in reading about her personal life and the events during her times. But would certainly be a dissappointment for people who are looking to explore her political genius.
2,Too narrow,"This book should have been entitled _The Marital Intrigues of Elizabeth I_. By page count, I estimate that it is:50% about Elizabeth's potential marriages;20% about marital and sexual politics at her court;20% about Mary, Queen of Scots;10% about everything else.No doubt these are important topics, but are they *that* important? I learned virtually nothing about Elizabethan domestic politics, art, society, technology, science, warfare, religion, or home life. Reading this book, one could easily be left with the impression that the only thing Elizabeth actually did during her entire reign was dynamically and proactively not get married.If your understanding of Elizabeth would be incomplete without a detailed description of rejected suitor Charles of Anjou's pockmarks, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, skip it."
5,Queen Elizabeth I for all.,"Weir's book was brought to my attention by two very reliable sources. One source is a Curator of an exhibit on the Queen and the other source was a Guild of Elizabethan reanactors. Both spoke highly of the book and its truthful information. I found the book incredible. I enjoyed how the text was very detailed but not overly academic. I enjoyed how the author mentioned what was fact and what was fiction about Her Majesties's life. I also enjoyed how the author noted whether establishments were still standing. Overall, the book was a wonderful read and gave me a mountian of useful information about Queen Elizabeth I."
4,History Without the Dryness,"I've read four of Alison Weir's books now, and whereas I usually dread to read dry historical novels, I truly enjoy hers. I enjoyed reading about the Elizabethan times, and the intricacies of politics, particularly when the monarch is a woman. With all the pressure to produce an heir, I find it amazing that she was able to hold out and never marry. And I also found it interesting that Weir never flinched from portraying Elizabeth's darker, pettier side. It made her seem more human than she has been portrayed before. I found it a great read for the British history enthusiast!"
5,excellent,"This is an excellent book. However it is not a beginners book. It is primarily a concept orientated tome, and will take a bit of work. While there is many booksthat claim to show you how computer progams run on a system, those books are mainly concerned with the hardware aspects of systems. This book completely ignores hardware and focuses exclusively on the software, which makes it a rarity. It is definetely worth 5 stars however a 4th edition is certainly due."
3,Tavern Crawling 101,"I oughtta love a book whose chapter headings all look like familiar beer bottle labels. And one that says: ""He's got that most useless of all college degrees, too: English Literature.""But - and it's a big a Lummox- sized butt, although this had a lot of heart, (a kind of flip of the tired ""hooker-with-a heart-of-gold,"" we have a Lummox with the same golden heart - if one takes the time to look further than the beer-belly) the scatologic preoccupation does grow rank. It is suitable for reading in the bathroom because of short segments & obsession w/ defecation. Still, it does have its moments. The ""insight"" into the male/female dynamic ain't John Gray, but it ain't bad for a Lummox.The author/subject/""cover boy"" of this biopic wrote in the 3rd person. He says he never figured out the mystery of the repeated ""vandalism"" to his Pinto. But a reader of many mysteries can do it!"
5,Very Informative Magazine,"Just subscribed to The Singing News and received it after about 6 wks! Thanks for putting our Gospel group, THE TIPTONS, inside the July 2012 (pg 36) issue. Love how you all help Southern Gospel groups and report on and about them. God bless you!:)"
1,"step down JUNK!! Don't waist your MONEY, AMO or TIME","Will not tighten up, scope moves, can not get rifle sighted in. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY, AMO or TIME!!"
5,Great Pirate Ship!,"Our son, who just turned 3 is obsessed with pirates, so we have alot of pirate toys around the house. This ship is great! It is very durable, which says alot coming from our household. Jackson is very active and not very ""gentle"" with his toys, but this ship has held up. I would definately recommend this ship!!!"
4,Excellent!,"As a new parent I was hesitant on cutting my son's nails but these really are a great set. I love that the clippers are ""beginner"" friendly - These are so gentle on baby's nails! TMany handles have blue rubber bump/grips on the handles! I used the brush, clippers, and emeryboards for about 10 months old. Then he took over (with the brush & comb, toothbrush).The grips are just right for him, too! We have had this set for a little over a year and a half now and we are still happy with the set!"
5,Into the WOW!!!!!!!!,"I saw these guys on many of their early tours and always loved them. I wondered how they would sound after all of these years and was pleasantly surprised. They still get it - heartfelt music, bluesy guitars and vocals, and hard driving songs. ALBUM OF THE YEAR. Look forward to seeing them this Saturday again."
2,Mixed bag,"When I first heard that Tesla had released a new album, I was afraid it was going to sound like it had been written in the early 90s. Thankfully, this CD sounds contemporary to current ""new"" bands.The music on the CD is comprised of mostly chunky guitar chords. I think the producers of this CD did an excellent job of making the guitars and drums stay alive and vibrant without wallowing in too much mud. I also liked the use of certain vocal, drum, and guitar effects I hadn't heard (or noticed) on previous Tesla albums. The music I think is pretty solid on this album.However, the lyrics are abominal. It's like they are sentences sung to the music. The lyrics don't compliment the music, but rather interfere with the flow. The word are clumbsy and fairly banal.The three strongest songs are What a Shame, Come to Me, and Caught in a Dream. There were several other songs I liked the music for, but the lyrics just ruined it."
3,Cute..,"Cute, but my daughter liked Babymugs better for some reason. For me it was interesting to see how some people dressed their babies."
5,Who wouldn't love these faces?,"I bought this tape to entertain my friends' babies when they come to visit. I honestly don't know who loves this tape more though, the babies or their mothers! Even toddlers like to watch and point out the 'babies'. These sweet little faces have provided hours of entertainment at my home. I recommend it anyone who has children or 'entertains' them."
3,Too improbable!,A great backdrop but too many odd characters and too many wildly improbable coincidences hurt the book. Grammatical and spelling errors abound. Three stars given only because I love the Coast Guard.
2,That sinking feeling,"I eagerly looked forward to reading this book. I'm from North Carolina and have spent wonderful days on the Outer Banks. I'm interested in submarine warfare; I just saw the full-length (nearly 5-hour) version of ""Das Boot."" I had read nothing but good things about all of Hickam's work.But I was quite disappointed. The plot starts well, as the reader learns of the tragic aspects of the two main characters' histories. But their romance is written on an adolescent level, as is the book's humor. The story quickly becomes rushed, sketchy, and ever more unbelievable.Hickam cripples his book with the use of preposterous coincidences, and his last chapter sinks the whole enterprise like a torpedo sinking a freighter."
5,Oprah's Book List,This book was great! I loved it ... and couldn't put it down.. Oprah got it right again!
2,Want a book about a strong AA woman? Look elsewhere.,"TEWWG is by no means a bad or boring book. In fact, it's a good read- it's dialogue may be difficult for some at first, but is actually an enjoyable aspect of the book.The only qualm I have with it is that its aimed at pleasing white folks. I'm not trying to be racist-- the main character is only 1/4 black, and her caucasian features are repeatedly exhalted for their beauty (thin lips, straight hair, etc.) The few white people in the book are the ones that give her support, while the AA community turns their back on her during her time of need. If you want a book that instills African American pride or about injustices, try Black Like Me because you ain't gonna find it here."
5,Janie Crawford is a model for the self-assured woman.,"I first read this novel as I was preparing to compose a seminar paper. I had no idea at the time that I would enjoy this tale so much.Janie Crawford is a hero(ine). Her struggle to protect her self from desecration is inspiring and wonderful.Zora Neale Hurston weaves humor and strength throughout to tie and bind this story. Her writing is, in my opinion, highly effective and the language and tone which Hurston uses has a story all their own. I loved this novel also because I was reminded of Alice Walker's The Color Purple for reasons so deep that I do not think I have enough room or time to describe."
1,Waste of Time,"It's been a while since I read this book, but there's nothing really special about it- it's not particularly deep, and the story doesnt really have all that much to say. Two thumbs down!"
1,Do Not Read This Book!,"I hated this book from page one. I had to read this last year in English and hated every minute of it. This is the most overated book of ALL TIME! Everyone in my class hated this book so much the teacher debated on if we should read this book or not. Unfortunatly we had to read it. I feel sorry for any person who has to read this ""book"""
5,"Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus...and her name is Zora","With breathtaking and insightful elegance, Hurston conveys the simplicity and complexity of a world now gone by. Her use of voice and poetic imagery is extraordinary -- and frequently misunderstood by the ""simple"" page-turning reader. This book must be read. Twice. Its power is surprising."
5,Their Eyes Were Watching God was a great book.,"Their Eyes Were Watching God, by famed African American writer Zora Neale Hurston. The book about the life, loves, and maturing of a woman, Janie, iis superb.Though the book begins slow, and some areas seem vague and irrelevant, after completion you will just sit there and think about it. I thought for a while and the book was excellent.Well written, topped off with southern dialect that makes the story all the more imaginable, Their Eyes Were Watching God was a powerful book that you will surely never forget, and be incredibly inspired by."
5,"wow, what an amazing story","This book trails the story of Janie as she finds her way towards her horizon. With beautiful words, Zora Neale Hurston lines the path of janie with gold as she meets Teacake, the man who ""engages her heart and spirit in equal measure and gives her the chance to enjoy life without being one man's mule or another man's adornment."""
2,An insult,"Like a large number of the reviewers here I was required to read this book for my English class. It was very difficult to get into it. It was near plotless and the dialect gets old very quickly. I couldn't stay focused on the story. I didn't see any substance in it. I can see why some people enjoy this book, but I don't think most people would. The thing I found most annoying about this book was the frequent jumping between southern dialect and the standard literary 40-letter-word vocabulary. They just don't go together very well. It shocks me that they expect highschoolers to read, comprehend, and enjoy this book."
4,Wonderful read by Ruby Dee,"Ruby Dee did an amazing job reading this book. In all honesty, I don't think I would have enjoyed reading the book, but with Ruby reading it was very easy to listen to. The book is beautifully written, but at times the prose seems a little too heavy for me. I would probably have struggled to read it."
4,Good Read,This book is an easy read but it contains underling themes and plot structures that can be discussed in a class room setting. This is a good book and provides an interesting insight in young black woman's life who is trying to find her perfect mate.
4,A classic in anthropological lit,"The title suggests why I feel that this work is so important. Hurston's purpose, in my mind, was to document a segment of society that was previously ignored by... well... everyone. Her power of prose in this work lies in her ability to capture the dialect of poor black folks effectively. Although her characters speak in an uneducated manner, due to their lot in life no doubt, the narrator's voice betrays a higher education than most black women of the time.I also feel that many people mistakenly read this work with a modern day life experience and don't realize that this work is, once again in my mind, meant to be read as an ideal of what women could be, not what they are, given the year in which it was published.A powerful book to which we owe its rediscovery to Alice Walker, not Oprah."
3,Their Eyes Were Watching God,"I was required to read this book in class. Although many of my peers disliked it, I found Their Eyes Were Watching God to be an interesting book. The vernacular dialect made it hard to read but I enjoyed the theme of love throughout the book. I was interested in the lessons that Janie, the main character, learned through each person that she met throughout her journey. I was interested in all of the African-American culture that filled this book. I would not recommend this book to everyone but it would be good for anyone who wants to broaden their horizons."
2,"Waiting to read the book, but uh...","The movie sure does suck. It's premiering on ABC right now. Apparently, this is Oprah's favorite love story of all time. I think she said the same thing about Dorothy West's The Wedding.This movie DOES NOT make me want to read this book."
5,Score booster,"I loved Bob Miller's SAT Math for the Clueless. I hate math- it has always been my greatest weakness in school and especially on the SAT. In math class, I never really comprehend the material and only memorize what I need to pass the tests. But this just wasn't cutting it for me on the SAT. This book was perfect for me because I am clueless when it comes to math. The explainations and exercises where simple and easy to understand and i felt more confident on test day. In the book's introduction, Bob Miller promises that he can help students raise their score by 100 or more points. I raised my own score by 140 points and am very pleased with what this book offers."
3,Not One of Terje's Best,"""Odyssey"" released in August of 1975 was a very successful release for Terje. It established him as a new voice in jazz-fusion guitar. I do feel, however, that this is not one of his best albums. The compositions are interesting, but unfortunately Terje's playing and in particular his guitar tone really ruin these songs for me. He hasn't achieved the soaring lead tone yet that all who are fans of his later work would recognize. What we have here is a tone that doesn't have any sustain and that's more harsh than smooth. I'm glad that I own this album, as now I have about 14 of his albums, but it's not an album that I'm going to listen to all the time.For essential Rypdal try these following releases:After the Rain (1976, ECM)Waves (1978, ECM)Descendre (1980, ECM)Eos (1984, ECM)Blue (1987, ECM)All of these albums have great compositions and great playing. These albums are also highly recommended by many Amazon reviewers."
4,useful for kinetic theory & statistical mechanics.,"Using it for a course right now. A little technical, but does have a lot of explanations. Highly recommended reference book/textbook."
5,Great Jazz Piece for a Rainy Day,"To set the mood for a reflective yet visionary piece, this collection ofBill Frisell with Paul Motian at drums cannot be surpassed."
2,Honestly people...,"Normaly, I would start of my review by summarizing the book. And thats what I started to do. But then I thought ""Whats the point? This book wasn't even very good""It starts off pretty intresting....Until Artemis meets back up with Holly. Then it just goes down hill from here.Hopefully Colfer will give us a better book in the near future, but for now, Skip this one"
4,One of the better ones......but,"I still think the first book is the best, but this is a close second and a much better book then the last installment. I felt the same thrills and laughed at the same humor as the other books. It brought to life more of the original spirit of the first book and the idea behind the series then the last two books. It is another fantastic read from Colfer, but all this being said, it just seems to be getting repetitive. There are no new characters of interest, and the characters aren't developing all that much for a series with four books. I am still unsure about getting the next one. Nevertheless, I suggest you read the first four!"
3,Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception,"Opal Koboi has been in a coma since we last saw her in The Eternity Code. However, even a coma won't keep Opal from exacting her revenge against those that twarted her earlier plot and placed her in this coma.With Artemis Fowl's memory wiped of all previous fairy memories, and Holly on the run and blamed for the death of the beloved Cmdr. Root there seems to be little hope for the fairy underworld when Opal decides to expose them. Nothing, however, ever seems to be impossible with a team of Holly, Artemis, Butler and Mulch Diggums."
5,"A book review of Eoin Colfer, 'The Opal Deception'","This is an excellent book, not only for children and adolescents, but also for adults. It continues the great tradition of 'the artic incident,'the eternity code' ..etc. I hope Artemis promise of 'more to follow'is also the Author's. Artemis ability to turn the tables on the pixie genius as he tries to recall his supressed memmories was entralling, and I really wish to follow his future adventures."
3,It could have been better...,"I have been hooked by this wonderful series since I read the original Artemis Fowl book and I consider it to be superior to Harry Potter.However, the Opal Deception unfortunately is a lacklustre book by Colfer's usually brilliant standard. Gone is the snappy and witty prose that marked the first three and his writing style in this book is completely different. This works well in the brilliantly written and beautifully handled death scene, but it jars in the rest of the story.I also think we see far too much of Mulch and his ""talents""; Colfer is going a bit overboard with the toilet humor in this one. Overall, the story was interesting and was action packed. I did love the truffle eating bit, that was hilarious! A good read, but it is very much a flawed work."
4,Thrilling!,This book keeps you guessing until the very end and it has a very surprising ending! Except I'm not sure how the changes Eoin Colfer will effect the later books.
4,This book was.....,"great! I would have to say that this is probably my favorite Artemis Fowl book, and I have read all of them counting the extra book that Eoin Colfer wrote. . . .I would recommend the whole series to anyone instersted in a series that has a plot and that's really fun and full of advanture!!"
4,VALUABLE FOR BOTH ASPIRING AND ESTABLISHED AUTHORS,"""The Writer's Handbook 2003"" is an informative book, which both new and established authors would benefit from. Regardless of its 2003 (annual) date, its information is much more durable than a year.In addition to information on publishers and their respective specialties, the contents of this handbook embraced all aspect of writing, including: poetry, audio books, e-books, newspapers and magazines. It also advises newcomers on how to expand their scope: with the view of becoming more versatile writers.This book appeals to both aspiring and established authors. It will particularly be of great value to those who are looking forward to publishing their works in Europe. But, I must add that anyone who already has a copy of 2000, 2001, or 2002 issue need not purchase this one. There is only a minor addition in this 2003 edition, when compared to the issues of the last three years."
2,Too much passion,"The actors in ths film are well-regarded and skilled. But the film is so heavy and depressing that even a well acted story does not redeem it. Passion is often regarded as dark. Sometimes it is. There are, however, real narratives of passion that include some nobility. This film is not one of them. I cannot say I enjoyed this film."
1,Just terrible.,It's like a daytime soap director attempted to copy David Lynch. Even Bill Murray can't save this. I'm not even going to go into details regarding the plot. Just stay sway.
2,Icky-poo,"Short attention span summary:1. Megan Fox plays a freak show attraction2. Mickey Rourke plays the male romantic lead3. Bill Murray plays a bad guy4. The movie is as implausible as the castingDescribed as surreal, gritty, seductive, hard-boiled and as classic film noir, this film delivers on none of its promises except if you enjoy watching two really seedy-looking old dudes hitting on a young babe with a rather pretty physical abnormality.The mere thought of Rourke's character ""Nate"", pawing at Fox's character, ""Lily"" with those freakishly ugly fingernails, or Murray's character ""Happy"" drooling over the young ""angel"" should be enough to give anyone the creeps.Weird fantasy movies are my cup of tea, but this one's lacking cream and sugar.Amanda Richards, June 23, 2011"
3,Love and passion UK70s+ Style,"A story of growing up pupils forming a love triangle of which one true lover has her hand up in a decade of a male participant played with less in love but more sexually active friend getting semi-handicapped at the end of story.Well, the seventies look different and no wonder at a young man changing attitude toward a healthy partner."
2,I can let go! Read the book-pass on the movie,"As always books are better than movies . Love most Keira Knightley movies- Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield were a plus.Movie lagged at times but what helped it was the location (beautiful).If you don't see it you wont be missing anything , read the book and play it out in your mind as you read it will be much better."
1,You'd have to sew my eyes open to watch this again!,"I had high hopes for this film which I take full blame for. I'm not going to spoil it because at the end of the day its just my opinion. The movie started off swell, seemed interested but quickly took a nose dive into the abyss of ""what the?!?!?!"" I think it was poorly executed and as a matter of fact, if I could execute this flick and put it to rest, I would!THUMBS DOWN!"
1,"Awful, don't waste your time!","What the heck? What a awful movie! So depressing. I got a headache! It was the most pathetic movie I've ever seen! They had no will to live, totally passive. I got so irritated with this ""so-called"" movie. What a waste of my time!"
5,Excellent CD,What a great CD. Wondering now why I kept on my wish list so long. Song selection is fantastic.
2,Economical! You may never have to buy another book EVER!,"Have you ever spent 3 days reading a book only to find that you're still on page 18? Well, neither have I until now. And no, it is NOT because I'm a slow reader. I've managed to plow through long or ""difficult"" novels with nary a hitch. Augie's picaresque adventures, however, make both ""The Sound and the Fury"" and the unabridged version of The Count of Monte-Cristo seem like Hemmingway's terse prose. Saul Bellow manages to place you, gentle reader, in an alternate BIZZARO universe where time passes while events around you unfold at breakneck speed. During Dingbat's stint as manager for the sea-sick boxer, I happened to observe the sun and clouds race across the sky as they invariably do in cheesy B-movie remakes of H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine"". My young bride was an aged crone by the time that dang lizard came around.I want my life back! What the? Get your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!"
2,Superficial and Sad Woman,"This book was interesting to a degree because Etta's career spans over many decades and she provides numerous anecdotes about famous people. However, her writing is self-indulgent and superficial most of the time and I got the feeling that although advanced in years, this woman has not gained much insight or maturity. I was angry that I had bothered to spend time reading the thoughts of someone with so little depth or integrity."
2,Creole for Travel,"This series would probably not be helpful to most people traveling to Haiti. The CD's do not cover enough vocabulary. Haiti is not exactly a place for tourists, which this series in various languages is intended for. Most people from the United States are going to this third world nation for humanitarian aid and could use something more along the lines of help phrases. However, the tapes have a lot of repitition and do provide a way to learn some simple phrases. I was very surprised how short each CD was. There is no written material to accompany the CD's for visual learners."
3,Very Basic & Limited,"Gives a pretty good idea of pronunciation, but is very limited in content. Provides a very small amount of written material meant for repetition only without giving the translation. For the price, I did not feel I recv'd very much. Was only slightly useful in preparing for trip to Haiti."
1,Reads like a first book,"This book has a reasonably engaging story line, but the author's inconsistent style and the abysmal editing made the book laughable. Literally. Out loud. It's apparent that Mr. Croft has a fertile imagination, but perhaps should spend more time on writing mechanics and/or should fire his editor. If you can get past the glaring grammatical mistakes, however, you may enjoy the plot. It would make an interesting screenplay -- a format which precludes sentence fragments and dangling participles."
1,Used 3 times and then stopped working,"I bought this at a local big box store. I used it 3 times and it quit working. In the manual it says there's a reset button, but it doesn't actually exist. To send it back to Rival themselves, you have to pay shipping both ways, costing approximately 1/2 of the purchase price. Search for this model before buying it. There are MANY problems with it."
1,LOSER!,"A terrible story and plotline. This is a poorly executed B movie and an obvious example of trying to make money by ripping off other films. The direction isn't bad for an action movie like an episode of TEXAS RANGER, a lot of blown up stuff. Just not happy I got suckered into renting it."
3,modern history in th emaking,"I think that the book sheds light on the misconceptions about the notorious Hollister incident, something that was handed to my generation as a ""legend"". Mind you, I'm an Athenian born in 1965 , when films like ""The Wild One"" werw considered as sf from the then conservative Greek society. I have to point out that BMW bikes played the role of HDs in Greece (same scenario: abandoned bikes by the German troops ), and probably that's the reason that I have not seen many Harley on the street, all my life !! You see, the ""dream"" bike is a BMW! (Swastikas not obligatory!)Do I ride ? Yes, I still backride with some friends that got old and drive CAREFULLY ! Did I like the book ??Well, it's like a n article from Easyriders, an extended one mind you, but it's pretty good, it shows that someone got in A LOT OF TROUBLE to fullproof his research, and, hell, it was a lot of fun!Glory days when nobody told you how and when you were supposed to enjoy your poor self!"
2,A Little Dry.,Good book if you're a Booze Fighter interested in the history of the club. Really the stories aren't that Wild.
3,Interesting Take on the Boozefighters history,"The antics of the original wild ones are somewhat interesting, but the book is a little repetitive and goes back to Hollister too much. The incident where the guy rides into the bar is repeated over and over again."
4,This cd is pretty good,"This cd is pretty good. All the songs have a good beat and good lyrics, they could have chosen some better unrelased songs but it is all good. A must have for any 2pac fan, 2pac still lives in his music and it shows on this cd!"
4,2 Pac,"This CD would be better if Outlawz weren't in it. HAs anyone here heard of the rapper BLACK HAZE ? He sounds exactly like 2 Pac! It wouldn't surprise me if Pac is still alive. Download napster, then get your self some songs by BLACK HAZE. SAME VOICE! Also listen to the words in 2 Pac's songs. In quite a few of them he explains what happended. ""Hit 'Em Up"" for example he say's ""You shot me, but you punks couldn't finish me""JUST LISTEN TO THE WORDS IN HIS MUSIC, and get some songs by BLACK HAZE (it's 2 PAc if you ask me) If you think he's dead, i'm sure this will change your mind.PS. 2 Pac is in Cuba."
1,I should have listened to The Source,"I thought it was gonna be a whole lot better but I guess I was wrong. I listened to it like 3 times then put it away. The source gave it 1 mic out of 5, guess I should have listened to them"
1,See this is mostly an Outlaw album.,"This album dont seem like it's 2pac's style, I guess because the outlawz are mostly rapping but it aint that good."
3,Not his best but some of it is pretty damn good,"This i thought was an ok album, the best songs being 4,5,10 & 12, but its probably better suited to hardcore pac fans."
5,Simple,"If you are a Tupac fan you need to have this album. Heard best played beginning to end. Just kick back and listen, relax, simple."
3,this is not 2pac but...,"When I heard the cd ""still I rise"" was out, I bought it immediately thinking it was going to be phat. Don't get me wrong, it was good but it just was not not 2pac. I mean the outlawz were just all over the album and they sort of took over control and kind of pushed 2pac to the back. And they are not really good rappers themselves. It's sad too. I mean this is supposed to be a fine reminder of rap music's best performer and song writer but it just ended up being - just an album."
1,not his best,"I love 2pac's music, don't get me wrong, he was a good man, but this has just got to be his worst album ever, it's not the worst, it;s just his worst. But if your a big 2pac fan like me, it's worth buying."
2,"BEATS,BEATS,BEATS!",NO DOUGHT I LIKE MR POOKIE AND ALL WE REP. THE SAME CITY BUT THE THING I DONT LIKE ABOUT THIS CD IS THAT ALL THE BEATS SOUND THE SAME! AND IT REALLY MAKES ME MAD CAUSE HE DOES NOT NOTICE. THERE IA ANOTHER RAPPER COME OUT OF NORTH DINO CALLED K-ROC AND IF YOU LISTEN TO BOTH OF THESE ALBUMS YOU WOULD THINK THEY ARE BOTH OF THE SAME BEATS USED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN! ALL I WISH TO SAT TO THE BOTH OF THEM IS SWITCH IT UP IF YALL DONT YOU WILL NEVER MAKE OUT OF THE CITY LIMETS AND THATS MY WORD! (OAK CLIFF SURREY ROW)
3,Standard,"SO first off this helmet kind of smells like dye. Every time I wear it and take it off, my hair smells like the same dye. The look of the helmet is great, but you have to wear the strap pretty tight because once you hit 40MPH it wants to sail. Not bad for a second helmet, but this will not be my primary."
2,DON'T listen to the audiobook!,"I have to be honest and say that I haven't quite finished this book yet, but wanted to warn anyone who is thinking of purchasing the audio book of The Innocent. I typically love audio books...they make my 35-minute commute go by so quickly. This one, however, is so over-detailed and TEDIOUS, that I'm tempted to go out and find the hard copy instead of finishing the audio version. I tend to be a skimmer, and this is one book that I would probably skim through at least half of if I had the opportunity. The whole time I'm listening to it I just want to yell ""Get on with it!""The story is okay so far, I guess. From reading the other reviews it sounds like I've already made it through the best part and it's all downhill from here....fabulous. Harlan Coben is not one of my top 10 authors anyway and I'll definitely never make the mistake of trying to listen to one of his books again!"
3,Not so Innocent?,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as most of Coben's books.. I have to agree with some of the other reviews, there were just too many people involved and hard to determine who actually killed whom. I was wondering if our poor couple Matt and Olivia got their $50,000 back to get their home and go on with life. Too many unanswered questions at the end."
4,Sustained Suspense,"Fast paced page turner all the way through, with plenty of rich characters and plot twists along the way. My only problem was with the conclusion. There were many, many loose ends of very complicated relationships, and every single one of them was tied off completely and in a fashion that the only missing line might be ""and they lived happily ever after"". This was satisfying in one way -- happy endings are okay. But with these tough people in the awful situations they faced all the way through the book, I expected a few tough things unresolved, as in real life. Anyway I'd recommend the book, since Coben's style and pace are great, his dialogue never flags and keeps the tension high throughout"
2,Not the greatest Coben,"This book started out well, and by the time I got half way through it, I didn't care if I finished it! Usually I like Coben's material, but this one---nope."
1,Very disappointed in this book,did not meet up to Harlen Coben standards. Very hokey. I like the father but not the son in these books. This was just plain awful. Typically I love Harlan Coben and have read about 20 of his books. This one...would not suggest.
3,For the first time,"A Harlan Coben novel that I didn't read cover to cover without hating to put it down. Not sure why, but this one didn't ""GRAB"" me like all of his others have to date. Still, a good read, just not one of my favs of his!"
5,Coben's Streak Continues,"Someone once described Harlan Coben's books as ""domestic mysteries"". I believe that is an apt description for this mystery that involved both husband and wife--and children born and unborn.I read this overnight and am still upset at myself that I was unable to make it last longer. Sometimes that Evelyn Wood speed-reading course is a curse.Having once worked at the Newark Airport, I can relate to the Howard Johnsons there and the well-described landscape that surrounds it. Mr. Coben's descriptions are lush and he pulls no punches. He describes what he sees and it is obvious he has been there. I like that in an author. Saves me the trip back.I highly recommend this book, but advise you to savor it slowly like a fine wine.One question: What about the felon-""borrowed"" white Isuzu left in the Harrisburg Airport parking lot? I want my loose ends tied up!"
5,WOW!!,"A teriffic roller-coaster read. I always snatch up the latest Coban at the library, and this one is a great read, Intricate, convoluted plot, likeable characters (although the violence is a tad graphic). Hard to put down."
4,Fun Book,I read this several months ago but never got around to writing the review. It is interesting to write a review of a mystery so much after finishing the book. What stays with me is the character development. Matt Hunter is terrific character. Portions of the book were far fetched but on the whole it was great fun.
4,Nice Mystery,Started out a bit slow. But the build up is good. I wasn't able to put down the book. The ending was a bit unexpected. Pretty good book.
4,Steam humidifier,Room humidity increases by 20%. The machine is very quiet. Filling the appliance daily and cleaning it weekly are somewhat of a bother. I live in a hard water area.
2,Choose another,This humidifier is now worth purchasing. It does not cover the square feet it indicates and the entire tank seems to get used in less than 10 hours. I am constantly refilling it. I had better usage from a humidifier I bought at Walgreens with half the tank size. I just don't recommend this item as it does not meet any of the indicators listed.
1,Do NOT Buy This Humidifier!,"Unfortunately, my experience was the same as most other reviewers. I only got two months use out of the unit before it stopped working completely: no mist, lights or power. Honeywell makes wonderful humidifiers, but this model is a complete dud.I have a couple of tips for other unfortunate souls who are about to return this horrible humidifier. A rep from KAZ told me to send the unit in to their Return Department and they would replace it at no cost (although I have to pay for the shipping to KAZ). If you're returning one of these units, be sure to tell the rep to do the following: waive the $10 warranty fee, and send a different model of humidifier as a replacement. The rep I spoke to had no problem with either of these requests. Now, I'll just have to wait and see if they follow-thru on a good replacement."
2,Disappointing,It stopped working in less than 3 weeks since arrival.....It should have a less than one star rating
4,:o),"Good, it keeps mosquitos away but not if you happen to sleep to close to it.... the mosquitos are terrible..... if you extented well beafore sleeping you will be ok"
3,Ink runs out quick,"Although I love my Canon camera and printer, I am disappointed with how quickly the ink runs out and needs to be replaced. As a matter of fact, the PIXMA printers won't allow you to print in black ink when a color tank is empty - even though you won't need the color. The price is always high too on the cartiridges."
3,Wrong Cartridge,I can't say that I have a problem with the product. I have a problem with the Amazon system bundling this black cartridge type with a different 4 pack that I got for the 3 non-photo color and 1 black cartridges I ordered.
3,Good but Expensive,"The 3 stars is because of the obscene price, otherwise it deserves higher.Quality of course is good.There are alternatives out there now for almost 1/2 the price, and with the chip attached - just insert and print.I must caution you though that the generics require an adjustment of your printer's color balance for optimum printing."
3,"OK, but very, very short shelf life and overpriced.","OK product, overpriced. Get this, and get used to buying ink quite a few times throughout the year. Think you will spend $25 once in the year you first buy this? No, you will spend over $200, because you will need to stock up on the product in order to ensure yourself that you will have ink at any given moment. Folks, it's not tremendously smart to buy one of these, when it will be emptied in about a month with moderate use. You will need to buy at least 2-3 each time you stock up, and expect to do this 2-3 times a year. Ink is actually of an ok quality, but the product is much, much too overpriced for me to recommend it to anyone outside of the very wealthy. If you buy this item in color, expect to use it once before it starts to wane."
1,ThIS IS NOT FOR CANON MP620 PRINTERS AS AMAZON SAYS IT IS,Amazon recommends this ink for the Canon MP620. It is NOT the right one. You would need a 220 ink for the MP620
3,seems ok?,"These seem to be as good as the tanks that came with the machine. It's hard to know, though. The ink seems to go really fast. I'd love to hear other opinions."
4,a Bottle of ink,"This ink does what it states. It prints well and does not seem to turn into some type of gelatinous mold clogging up your print heads like the kind that are 3 for 20...I just became sick of throwing out good printers because soaking the ink cartridges in alcohol does not really work completely unless you catch it in time. Soooo, its either buy the good stuff or buy laser and deal with the powdery stuff.Good Day I said..."
3,Not So Good,"Great idea, but this unit did not operate easily nor for very long. Batteries would fall out of hand held unit, etc. There must be better ones on the market. Look for them."
2,Excellent product and service initially,"This multimedia wireless presenter is everything you need to control your presentations. It has the laser pointer, volume control, etc. Price was super affordable. Works wonderfully initially but after several months of use, it has gone south with it not working with my projector or computer at all. I don't know what went wrong but you definitely do not want to buy this product."
3,shiny ring,"The make of the ring is fine but the finish on the ring is too shiny. It looks and feels like shiny plastic. I don't know why it is different than other silver rings I have bought from Amazon. I have bought earrings here also that had the super shiny finish. In my opinion, the shiny finish makes the items look like they aren't really silver."
4,Good coverage of what is known and what might have happend.,"Gave you a good feel for what the last trip of the Fitzgerald was like. And for the people who sailed her. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of how storm systems affect the great lakes region. The author did work hard to include biography material on each crew member, but was careful not to over do these sections.I enjoyed the book immensely and intend to read other works by the author."
3,A page-turner with good detail.,"Book's suggestion at end that official report of most probable cause of sinking ignores a very compelling alternative is the most disturbing part of this excellent book. Also, egregious mistakes detract: e.g., Egerton, Germershansen and Greer instead of Edgerton, Germeshausen and Grier; Lorain C for Loran C."
2,Torn,"Great images and the book does peek my 17 month olds attention, but the pages that lift up to reveal the animals tear off so easily. After only three reads most of the flaps were torn off - which means no more peek a boo!"
5,My husband loves them.,"My husband is very tall and they had the right size for him. I ordered 2 pairs, and they will last a very long time. We are very pleased with this product."
4,awsome,"I've had these about 3 weeks. I like them a lot, but I wear a 30x34 in jeans. I got 32x36 size in these, and they fit great, but not really big enough to wear over other clothes. So, if you plan to wear these over I would get 2 sizes bigger in the waste. Length was perfect."
3,bad paperwork,"have ordered lots of items through amazon , so iwas really suprised the way they fumbled the ball on thia carhartt order,i dont know if the supplier or amazon did it ,you have to pay frieght to return a blunder on amazon's part.buyer beware"
5,A Romantic Rhapsody,Gogol gives us in this little book a romantic snapshot from Russian history. Essential reading for all lovers of Russian literature.
4,Pretty Good,"Night of the Twisters is a book that 11-15 year olds should read. The characters are described well and book was pretty good. The books story line was great and easy to follow.I really liked the ending and the books setting was good too. Overal Night of the Twisters was a good, suspenseful, awsome, action packed book that I would recommend."
5,One of my favorites!,"This book is EXCELLENT, and not just for kids. And personally I think it's one of the scariest books I've ever read. Basically a 12 year old boy is home alone ona stormy night with his best friend and his baby brother when a twister hits, completely destroying their house and their entire neighborhood."
3,looks like it would work,I ordered this as a main seal for my engine but it was too small so I returned it. The listing said it would fit my D16Z6 honda engine but didn't.
2,se vendió???????????????????,"nooooooooooo, este disco es demasiado ""for export"", está echo para que bailen los chinitos (o japoneses mejor dicho, para mi es lo mismo).no se puede escuchar mucho este disco.no puedo creer que este musico no haya tenido un mejor disco en vivo debajo de la manga.no lo escuchen, no lo compren....stay away from this! (así se dice?)"
5,great,Purchased this item to enhance look of my jeep and it has done just that great product.easy to install and looks great
3,Waaay to small.,I got the premium delivery. I ordered it on a friday and got it on wednesday which I thought was pretty good from the States to Canada.The jacket is nice. The main letters are kind of frayed on the edges not as crisp as it looks on the picture.However - the sizing is way off. I've bought a lot of jackets and hoodies and usually wear an XL. This XL isnt even close. Its three inches higher than my wrists and hugging my waist. The XL is more like a medium. I'm gonna try to sell it to my ex - if it even fits her. I'm reluctant to exchange because even if I go up a size I doubt it'll be big enough. What do I need - a XXXL lol Im 6' tall and 185lbs. What a pain.
4,Goos Films Must Be Revisited,"If one contextualizes this film, Blockade revisits the Spanish Civil War and later the Hollywood Blacklist."
1,Unexpectedly boring,"I really expected to like this book, but I finally gave up. This is one of the few books that I just could not finish. The wry spark from the earlier books is just not there. I have to wonder if Clive wrote any of this?"
4,Great Read!,"Clive Cussler scores again in his first coordinated effort with his son Dirk. Fans of Cussler's hunky leading man Dirk Pitt will be surprised to see how the character has changed, but he's every bit as resourceful, and the overall action is even more exciting as Pitt teams up with his long lost children. Tough to put this one down!"
4,black wind CDs,We are enjoying Black Wind while traveling. But we are hooked on Clive Cussler books. We wish there were more Oregon files.
1,The intellectual stimulation of a Hardy Boys book,"I'll admit that I read this lumbering piece of drek all the way through, mostly just to observe how vapid it could become. If you read this book and want more of the same, try ""The Hardy Boys and the Secret of Pirate's Hill"". You'll be thrilled."
1,UGH! Very disappointing,"I like the adventures of earlier Clive Cussler NUMA Dirk Pitt Novels, so I was eager to read Black Wind. I found myself struggling through each page, wondering if the ""cookie cutter"" plot would get any better, but no. On top of that, why does Pitt JR get all the ""heroic"" stunts while his twin sister frets like a Victorian heroine? I hated to see her protrayed as a weak nervous second fiddle to her brother. Skip this book and re-visit some of the older classic Cussler novels, much more fun!"
4,ok curling iron for the price.,"i've only used my iron a few times, and i must say i am overall satisfied...i mean, for the price, it works well...i didn't have any outrageous expectations.i only gave it 4 stars because i've only had it for over 1 month...so , i don't know how long mine will last...If it'll last me years, then, id give it 5....."
3,"WRONG SWITCH, SWITCHED REVIEW","I am looking at Switched, with Tony Curtis and Roger Moore, I see Ellen Barkin and genger bending reviews. I hope this gets cleared up so the proper movie paid for isnt switched."
3,GOOD ENTERTAINMENT,"Ellen Barkin plays the role of Steve Brooks, after Steve gets killed by three ex-girl friends that he two-timed. But two-timing is how Steve Brooks plays all girl friends. As punishment his body gets stuck in limbo. The devil quickly intervenes and cuts a deal; if Steve can find one girl on planet earth that will say something nice about him, then the devil will allow him to pass into heaven.And so, the situation is set in place providing lots of fun and laughs.Eventually, Steve does get to heaven, but you will never guess in a million years who the girl is that says something nice about him. Only Blake Edwards could have contrived-up an outcome like this.The movie is good and for the price worth a look-see."
5,Chakra Balancing,This book is terrific! I recently had a client whose chakra's would not stay balanced. After reading Steve's book I tried his solution and had immediate success. Thanks Steve for another wonderful book. I find Steve's book to be clear and well written. The photos are especially informative and easy to understand.
3,worth reading if you're a fan,"If you're a Buk fan you'll want to check out his earlier 'more lyrical' poetry; basically not as raw and hard-hitting as his work in the Seventies and beyond, a bit more fancy word-work involved, but still interesting. If you're not a fan, and prefer all that pretentious abstract imagist poetry, then this is probably the only book by the man that you might like..."
5,orange+pink color,"I love this watch. The color is half way between orange and pink. On top of that it was a good deal, $99.99."
3,Tired,"I've read them all and either my expectations are too high or Tony Hillerman is getting tired. Wailing Wind just didn't rivet me the way previous books did.I've thoroughly enjoyed reading about the Desert Southwest and the Navajo nation in particular, though, and likely will continue to pick up his novels, but I'll probably opt for the paperback edition in the future."
5,Hillerman's Still Got It !,"Like most Hillerman fans, I have read every scrap that he's written about the goings on in the Navajo nation. I have never submitted an online review before, but I feel compelled to tell readers that this is one of his best. He has certainly not lost his edge in any way. In my opinion, Wailing Wind ranks near the top."
4,The World From a Different Point of View,"Terrific! Stayed up most of the night to finish it in one go!No mindless or gratuitous violence. Well thought out plots and down-to-earth dialog. And best of all, no passages I'm not old enough (at 60) to read without embarassment. Great read!The biggest problem with reading a Hillerman book is that you have to wait another year for the next one."
4,Good Old Friends,"Hillerman has a formula at work in his Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee mystery series, and. as time goes on, the smooth coating wears in places here and there and the fundamental structure shows through, a tad naked. THE WAILING WOMAN is one of those where you can see scattered holes unfilled by character development or cultural background information. It's not so much that there are inconsistencies in the plotting as there are some implausible motivations and non sequiturs. Hillerman's usual red herrings aren't running too strong in this stream. That said, Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee are good company, so if you like them, this won't disappoint. This volume does offer a wry tour of bureaucratic land rights issues and injustices that plague the Navajo nation."
3,Not up to Hillerman's usual standards,"Let's face it, if you're a Hillerman fan you're going to read this book no matter what the reviews say -- and in a sense you almost have to in order to make sense of subsequent books. But for the record, The Wailing Wind falls far short of the quality of most of the titles in the series. The plot is thin and improbable and the other typical Hillerman elements like character development, insight into the Navajo world, a sense of place and touches of mysticism are in short supply."
3,Good Basic Mystery,"An old murder is connected to a recent murder and a hunt is on for a missing woman. Joe Leaphorn is back and helping Jim Chee solve these mysteries. There is a little of the Navajo way in this story, but not as much as in previous Hillerman novels. Still, it was good to meet up with these characters again and Officer Bernadette Manuelito was a welcome addition. This is a good basic mystery and the budding romance between Bernie and Jim Chee was a nice touch."
3,Beware the Baracoda,I don't own this product but have experienced the absolute worst ever customer support from the company on another of their products.
4,Better Than Must See TV!,"Sharpe's stories add life to the flat existence of our culture's strange little filmic sales pitches. His humor is dark and the characters are fully-formed, not like some hack actors, but rather like the folks down the street. One of my favorite books of the year."
5,Equally appealing to both boys and girls. . .,"This beautifully written novel has all the ingredients kidslove -- flawed but likable characters, a secret, suspense, humor, snappy dialogue, and a satisfying ending.Sure to be a hit for individual reading or as a classroom readaloud."
5,Truth about a Savior,"I love this book!!! It was a book that had a lot of thought provoking truths to chew on. The way the author took me on a journey of the life of my Savior was one that I could relate to. She used personal testimony along the way that kept me intrigued to forge on in my travels down the streets of Nazareth. The truth about who Jesus is and how he came into the world was portrayed so vividly in my mind, it was like I was there in the stable. I was so encouraged by the power that reigns in Jesus Christ and the victory and freedom that comes when we relinquish all to Him.I have used many exerpts from this book in my personal life as well as in my ministry life. I would and have recommended this book for all to read. I am excited to see more from this author, she is definately annoited by the Lord. Praise the Lord for her faithfulness in carrying out the Great Commission!!"
5,All Time Favorite,"Footloose is a great movie and the soundtrack is even better. I purchased the album when it was originally released and I thought it was great. But now with the extra tracks it makes it more complete and grabs more of the movie's feel on CD. Like the addition of Quiet Riot's ""Bang Your Head (Metal Health)"" and Foreigner's ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"". This is a great CD to own for a fan of 80's music and of movie soundtracks."
3,FOOTLOOSE ~ A little too loose for me.,"A great CD! However, it cannot compete with the hits from ""FLASHDANCE""."
4,Blast from the Past,"Wow, look at those pictures of Kevin Bacon, remember when this movie was in the theater? Ages ago! The music here is dated and certainly riding the 80s synth wave, some of the songs stand the test of time while others really do deserve to be forgotten but if you're buying this you're buying it for nostalgic reasons. Maybe you remember sitting in the movies with your date, or dancing to these tracks at a party, maybe you had the tape and it played at the beach in your boombox; if so, then this disc is a reminder of days gone by, days that are fun to recall. So go ahead and spend a few bucks, pop this disc in the car and sing along with Kenny Loggins in traffic, you'll feel like a teenager again, after all that's who this was intended for, all of us that were teens in the 80s."
5,Great Source!,"This product does exactly what it is designed to do. It boosts your active vocabulary in the target language. If you already speak another romance language, or if you have studied French previously, this product will help you to gain a higher level of comprehension. Most products are designed for beginners and the expectations are kept at a minimal. Also, I am a foreign language teacher and I feel many professionals would disagree with the format of not classifying the vocabulary by theme. But, I find the random words to be a better challenge for people that will be experiencing exposure to the target language in random and varied settings. These situations don't always fit into perfect vocab sets...(ex: going to the airport - shopping - checking into a hotel). I recommend this product and intend to order the Spanish version for my students."
2,The music is too loud,"I agree with all the good things these other reviews say, except about the music. The music is way too loud; you're trying to listen to the pronunciation of the words, and this chamber music is trying its best to drown out the material. When the music isn't playing, the program is great, but when the music starts I want to strangle the producer. The music would be great if it was IN THE BACKGROUND where background music belongs!"
2,Confusing.,"Confusing is the word I use to describe this book. I guess if you are familiar with all this stuff, it may be ok, but I spent the whole quarter looking for stuff that I never found. I had to rely on internet search to help me with terminology and lingos."
2,not a great strap,you get what you pay for. its a strap. it has a locking mechanism (although not a sturdy one). the locks rub the finish of the guitar. not a great strap.
3,false picture,"Unfortunalty, I cannot reveiw the pictured item, because this is not what you get. The item pictured (which is what I wanted) is actually GS11DR. The item received is the upgrade from GS10RHR. The main difference between the GS10RHR and the newer GS11RH is the and extra 1000 watts. Don't see it. I've used the GS10RHR for many years. Loved it. The newer one is bigger, so of course it takes up more room and doesn't fit in my carrying case for the older model, but doesn't work any differant. Disappointed that you don't get the pants attachment that is pictured on Amazon (which is the GS11DR model)."
5,Dad's fav,"Gift for my dad so he could do his suit jackets hanging up, he said he really liked it and it was easy to use."
3,Desperado.,"Desperado is an ok movie, little overdone,excessive violence and near impossible things happening. It's worth watching for Selma Hayek. It's long,and at times pointless.dvd has no special features and the main screen looks like it was homemade.dreadful music too."
1,Totally unrealistic and lotsa gory [stuff],"That pretty much sums it up. Banderas' character is looking for his wife's killer, and is always finding himself being [at risk] by dozens of people at a time. Of course, the""Desparado"" is never grazed by a single bullet, and knife attacks don't seem to faze him either. He is the Latino Superman, but with no real purpose. He has a leading lady (Selma Hyack) who helps Desparado [destroy], and there is a memorable love scene. Lots of traumatic explosive [end of life], however, so be warned."
1,The worst movie I've ever seen.,"First let me say I loved ""El Mariachi,"" so I wanted to give this movie a chance. The first scene had promise--I love Steve Buscemi. The rest of the movie proved to be a disaster; I actually laughed at this movie, and I don't think it was meant to be funny at all. At least not the parts I laughed at. It actually contains the stupidest scene I have ever witnessed: Antonio Banderas jumps backwards from one building to another, kills everyone firing at him, both on the building and on the ground, and manages not to sustain one injury doing so. If you like action films, do not watch this one. And for the sake of all that is good and holy, don't waste your money on it."
4,A Mexican John Woo film,"Without question, Robert Rodriguez made a sequel to El MARIACHI that looks exactly like a John Woo movie. Antonio Banderas blasts away at the bad guys with two 9MM pistols in each hand. Thousands of ammunition rounds are fired. An unbelievable number of people are killed in the shootouts, and blood is sprayed all over the place. And it all takes place in Mexico."
1,DESPERADO SUPERBIT,DO NOT WASTE YOR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS NEW SUPERBIT FORMAT. THE FIRST DVD DID NOT WORK AFTER CHAPTER 4 SO I BROUGHT IT BACK AND GOT A NEW COPY THAT ONE ALSO DID NOT WORK AFTER CHAPTER 4. COLUMBIA THINKS IT CAN PUT A FANCY NAME ON A DVD COVER CHARGE US MORE FOR IT AND THEN FORGET ABOUT QUALITY. WHAT COLUMBIA FORGOT IS THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO WOULD BUY A SUPERBIT DVD IS SOMEONE WHO TRULY IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL IN A DVD. THIS PURE PERFORMANCE IS A TOTAL LET DOWN. DESPERADO/10 SUPERBIT/0
1,YEECH!!!! Violenced for its own sake.,"Mass killing and destruction with no point. Also has miserable acting. Amazingly in typical ""John Woo"" movie fashion the hero survives hundreds of gun shots fired at him along with several deadly knives. The horrible thing about violent movies like this is that it glorifys violence. Impressionable people think that it would be okay to engage in fights like this."
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER!,"RODRIGUEZ IS NOTHING BUT JUST AN OLIVER STONE WANNABE, WHO THINKS THAT ANY MOVIE WITH BLOOD AND SHOOTING CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. VIOLENCE WITH NO SENSE, POOR EFFECTS, AND ALSO I HAVE TO MENTION THAT BANDERAS IS THE WORST ACTOR I'VE EVER SEEN. IN A FEW WORDS, I WOULD DESCRIBE THIS MOVIE AS A POOR MEXICAN FLICK."
3,So what do you call normal?,"It was refreshing to see an author who is willing to view organisations from a perspective of whether or not their culture would represent healthy living or not. The verdict is 'no'. Wilson Schaef and Fassel, by presenting organisational culture and inflluence as pervasive and abberent makes us rethink their place in our human psyche and society. A refreshing view, even if a rather disturbing conclusion. A good book to let go our inertia."
2,needs better tape,"this is my second windguard from this company, looks really nice, but the ends keep peeling up, they need to put a stronger bonding tape on this, eventually they come completely off"
5,The Queen of Hip - Hop Opens Up !!,"Although in the past Mary has been known to sing of STRUGGLE/DEPRESSION and PAIN, on this albulm Mary is freeing herself of all the demons that haunt her. Mary's up beat tunes and open heart let's us know that soon there would be "" NO More Drama "" in her life. She even collaborates w/ an Ex- (from HELL!- KC), she dosen't forget the Mary she once was only BATTLES herself to be BETTER! Mary has Love, Sex, Joy, Pain and Experience all into this #1 CD. I RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Insipid doesn't begin to describe this book,"I have never been so disappointed in a book in my life. The premise is great, but the execution was beyond horrible. The characters are one-dimensional, the writing is bland, and you never get to know these people beyond the ""I'm a gay teenage jock in a small town."" There was a real opportunity to show gay people as REAL people, and sadly, the opportunity was missed. I can only hope Roeder's writing improves in the ensuing novels."
3,trouble in paridise The Fast Track One Day Detox,I am 48yrs old- read the book The Fat Flush Plan. Loved it. Did the fat flush diet easily and saw it work on me. I lost 10 lb. in two weeks. I continued to the Fast Track One Day Detox. I was so surprized that I felt so good on the fast. I was never hugery or did not have a headache--it was wonderful. I started the detox at 133lb (I needed to loose at least 13 more lb) The problem is that I woke up the day after the detox wieghing 135 and feeling weak and bloated. I followed the book page by page for the detox. I drank all the water and the juice --I did everything by the book --had the flax seed with the juice. Im now at the end of the 1st day after the detox feeling alful. there is no one to ask what to do. Nothing in the book to explain what to do. I assume Im constipated and these are the results but what else can I do. And why did this happen?signed lost
5,What a way to jumpstart my weightloss!!!,"I just LOVE Ann Louise Gittleman! I have all her books and this latest addition is truly remarkable! I discovered her Fat Flush plan in 2003 and lost 30 pounds in 10 weeks. I knew that this latest development of hers would work too! I had gotten ""off plan"" for a while and really regretted that and needed a jumpstart to begin again. I went through the 11 day prequel, fast & sequel and lost a total of 6.5 pounds and 10.5 inches off my body! 4 pounds lost during the prequel and then another 2 right after the fast and another 1/2 pound after the sequel. I am now eager to continue this way of eating, this way of LIFE! This got me back on track.... the FAST TRACK. Thank you ALG!"
5,I lost 9.5 lbs in 11 days!,"This is a great book. The name is a little deceptive, as the complete detox is actually 11 days, with 1 day of fasting (it is a juice and water fast, so it is not as bad as it sounds). Expect most of your results in the week prior to the fast. My scale did not budge on the day of the fast, but I lost 7.5 lbs in the week before that. Overall, this is a great book with sound guidance. I suggest that you follow up with the Fat Flush Plan book if you need to lose more than 10 or 15 lbs."
1,"disillusioned already, even before reading book.","I gave this one star even though I haven't read it yet. In fact, I probably will read it eventually. But I lost trust instantly. All it took was reading the title and the book description. I received a postcard from Ms Gittleman plugging this book. How wonderful, a one-day diet! And I will lose 8 pounds! Well, I went immediately to amazon to look up the Fast Track One-Day Diet! Here's the problem - Turns out this is not a one-day diet, it's an 11-day diet. How can I trust this book after this misleading hype? I have a bookshelf full of diet books that promise to be the last diet I will ever need, including just about every book Ms Gittleman has written. The ugly truth is that in order to lose weight we have to change our eating habits and we have to exercise. No one-day miracles."
2,only thing that keeps it from a one star is DICE!,"As mentioned by others, this is pretty bad. I think B action movies are worse that B-horror movies. It is also boring at time, no classic DICE lines in this either. The one African American head cop (or what ever he was) was one of the worse actors I ever seen: as soon as he said his lines he was so over acting i laughed my but off (only funny thing in the movie) Anyway, glad I did not rent this, or own it, i caught it on cable TV, i would never buy it. BTW - Dice needs to add hair color to his side burns, they look stupid!"
4,"Gorgeous ""coffee table"" book","This book is full of absolutely beautiful photos of (mostly old) American sterling place and serving pieces. Its strength is to help identify unusual pieces that people today don't have a clue about. Not very useful for identifying patterns, unless you happen to stumble across a photo of a pattern whose name you are seeking. Patterns are not indexed, but types of pieces are. The price guide (e.g., $30 to $85 for a teaspoon) is absolutely useless. Interesting form to photocopy to use to keep track of pieces you acquire."
2,Leaky Thermos,"Worked great for about 3 months then developed a leak. It started leaking from the main seal at the top. Leaks everytime I pour a new glass. Also, the smaller inset lid needs to be tourqued down very tight to prevent leaks. The Thermocafe was never in the dishwasher, never dropped and never used to store hot liquids. I only used mine for iced tea. Just seems to be a bad design with the leaky seals."
2,Did NOT work,"The idea is clever, clip the beefy holder to your vehicle's heating duct vent. This is accomplished with two little clips. The problem is that if your vents swivel VERTICALLY in addition to horizontally, when you put your Ipod on the holder, the weight of the Ipod swivels the vent downward so that your iPOD is now facing toward the floor. Other than jamming something in the vent to prevent this, there is no easy way to fix this problem...AND it is VERY hard to get the clips off ....SO - take a good look at your car first. If your vents swivel VERTICALLY then I'd really think twice about trying this.... BTW my vehicle is pretty standard, a Toyota Tundra."
3,Not so good Hardy book,"This was a good Hardy adventure, though there was goodparts and bad parts:The goodThe humorThe adventureThe badThe case was easy to solveHardy's are getting a bi corny"
2,Underwhelmed about says it all...,"This sequel could have been great, and in fact has a clever plot for the most part. It falls apart at the end, though. I admit, I'm a sucker for a happy ending, and grouchy when I don't get one. Still, although I admire Carole Nelson Douglas, I think the plot decayed into gibberish just as it was wrapping up. Characters start doing nonsensical things, the bad guy wins, etc.Left me with a bitter aftertaste. If you read the original Probe, skip the sequel and save yourself the hassle.Jkirk3279@aol.com"
1,Not nearly as good as the (much cheaper) competition. Avoid!,"I saw this software in a Mac store and based upon the features listed on the box, I bought it. The limitations for this version of the software are extreme: you can't make your own chord diagrams, you can't score more than a few instruments and play it back (there's apparently a limit of MIDI channels allowed) - getting around both of these problems require the most expensive version of the product --- and the ""upgrade"" cost is $400! The manuals aren't particularly helpful, either.As a comparison, check out Harmony Assistant which for $70 has all the features of Print Music 2006 and much much more (actually it's closer in features to the pricey upgraded version from Print Music)."
5,Perfection!,"These pans rock my world, we did a ton of reaserch on what to buy before we went ahead and chose anything and some of tge reviews I read for this product made it seem like a gamble.. So I'm here to say whoever says its not nonstick enough is justice moron. Keep a little bit of oil in your pan (coconut oil works amazing) like you would any pan, and your golden!!! Plus knowing their are no harmful chemicals possibly cooking right into my families food makes the price tag irrelevant.Love them! Won't ever buy anything else!"
1,Can't clean in the Dishwasher,To me the whole purpose of purchasing high end cookware is to make cooking and clean up a snap. With this product it's not dish washer safe so you always have to clean with hot soapy water. What a colossal waste of time.
1,Skip these!,These pans are really bad...Firstly they are non-stick... no I mean really food attracting. Second they came pre-scratched...Find something better... I'm taking my loss and moving on to another brand. Never again...
3,"Great for stores, not good for crafts fairs or festivals","The organization I work for bought three of these to use for the various events we go to where we sell our clients' artwork. We had a line of holiday ornaments, so that's why we needed something like this display stand.It was very easy and quick to put together and I think would work great for someone who is looking for a permanent stand in a store or something where you're not having to frequently transport it to different locations.We started calling these things ""the spiders"" because they catch on everything and take forever to untangle! They're impossible to carry around put together - they take up lots of space, are pretty fragile (we had several of the arms break off), and the top or the bottom always starts screwing off. Taking them apart wasn't much better since you still had odd angles and the arms easily break."
3,Average but not Bad,"This is a movie edited together from episodes of the Western TV series ""The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"" with Kurt Russell. Pretty average stuff but not bad."
2,No re-read value as an adult sadly,"This is a mini review for the original print of this book. For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book blog listed in my profile...I seemed to remember these being more ghostly in nature, and not so brief. A great read for children - it WILL spook them. But probably not a good read or reread for adults. It was nice to revisit some of the stories from my childhood, but I will look elsewhere for classic ghost stories. I do remember them being a lot better then they were."
4,More Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark,Alvin Schwartz can write some really scary stories. While I was reading this book I kept getting scared. Some parts in this weren't very scary though. But most of the time the stories were scary or funny. I would recommend this book to people who like getting scared or like to read funny stories. I like the fact that this book has lots of short stories. They leave you wondering what will happen next.
2,"Wanted used, received new...","Was actually disappointed with what I received. Was trying to find the original prints of the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark series, mainly for the original art work, but received the new reprints with tamed down art work."
2,Meh,"I guess I was just expecting more from this gift, and it is partially my fault for not reading the full description better but i basically expected them to be bigger, both from the picture and just in general due to the level of detail required to reproduce the characters. I will be keeeping them and giving them as a gift as intended, and see how well they go over, but my not hoping for a lot, definitely had higher expectations for the product than what was delivered."
2,Not great.,"I wasn't happy with this. It was a gift for a NBC fan. It was a while back but I remember feeling foolish that I paid that much for it. If you saw it in a store you would expect to pay $2 tops. I think she liked it as a fan, but it was more like a christmas ornament than a doll.To be fair, I probably didn't read the description well enough, and maybe my expectations were unrealistic. It does say that they are only 7"". I had other NBC items as a gift and I used this doll set as the ""bow"" on the package. For that it worked well."
3,Smaller than Thought,"My daughter loves Nightmare Before Christmas so I thought this would be a great Christmas present. However, they are almost the same size as a coke can. I guess I over looked the 7"" in the description."
5,Gentle Ben Rules!!,This is a great 60's TV series about a bear and a boy in the Florida Everglades.Starring Dennis Weaver and Clint Howard.
2,rebuttal,"Having read the most recent review in this data base, I must exercise my option for equal time. I found the content on the album to be disjointed, and it's lyrics quite subversive. The comparision to the Beatles I found interesting, yet not accurate. If I were forced to make a British Invasion comparision, I would liken the polyrythmic structure to that of the Richards, Jagger sounds of the mid 60's. All in all an interesting album to add to the collection if for nothing else than cocktail party converstion."
5,The clarinet sound is much better than other reeds.,"My daughter play her clarinet and all family listened the difference in the sound, it's a good product. It's and excellent reed."
1,Useless,Complete junk - they're not at all puncture resistant and the seems fell apart in about a week of moderate use.
2,A FLUFFY READ,"FOR A 6,000 MILE CANOE JOURNEY, MY HATS OFF TO THIS COUPLE BUT PUTTING DOWN ON PAPER IT MISSED THE MARK. A VERY FLUFFY READ AND IT NEVER CAUGHT THE FEELING OF THE ADVENTURE IT WAS. EVEN WHEN THEY ENDURED RAIN AND COLD IT FELT LIKE THE SUN WAS OUT."
2,from seance to exorcism,"This starts out as a seance held in a mortuary, with the whole thing videotaped by the intruders, until one gets possessed by a demon and the others try to exorcise it. Mayhem and chanting ensue. Nothing you haven't seen before."
4,Perfect but small...,"WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT FOR A SPECIAL JOB, like your back is itching and it need scratching or you want to put medication on your back or the heel of your foot or the back of your thighs and legs and can't reach those body parts...you need help, you need a good helper, a dependable helper.I like this applicator because it is a highly likeable design, one can put meds or lotions on and then simple snap out the head on the applicator and wash it with soap and water and put it back on in a snap.The lotion or med smooths onto the body like paint on a wall.The only thing I think needs to be imporved is maybe the size of the roller but they may have tested things and found that a better application of meds or lotion occurs with a smaller head. I like this product! It fits in my desk drawer at work because it folds."
3,The Presidents = How it's Changed,"Trying to keep up with the ever changing Presidency, we bought to refresh our own public education background, learn something new and continue our education. Nixon era could have used more depth, as could have Reagen years. The series could use an update with adding Clinton, Bush & Obama....and maybe a bit less scandel stuff."
5,Amazing Product,This is an outstanding set. I love the information contained on all the presidents. My kids actually enjoy watching this. I told them that the information learned was like hearing gossip... How fun and informational. Even if you are not a history buff you will enjoy this set.
3,"Chic, but pictures were rather tiny","I bought this book before all the Jackie style books came out. This is a good book, and what Oleg says of Jackie is insightful--but the pictures were secondary to the words! (And the cost!) There would be a drawing taking up the whole page, with this little picture of Jackie. Plus, it doesn't have all the clothes she wore--and--- They are not all his clothes!...This book, however, is a nice companion book to the Jay Mulveney book, or even the Hamish Bowles if you chose to buy that....If you want to know about Jackie's style, buy this or the IN THE KENNEDY STYLE by Latetia Baldridge, or especially the Jay Mulveney book."
1,Lushlife falls short...,"After a couple years of waiting for this album, I must say that I was quite disappointed. The band has now abandoned the subtle, drowned vocals that really made their style stand out. Lushlife fails to live up to the dreamy, transcendental classics of the past. Unless you'd like to complete your Bowery Electric collection, this album should be left on the shelve..."
4,another dope release from a doper artist known as Killah Priest,"""View From Masada"", hits me as a second chapter of his crittically acclaimed debut ""Heavy Mental"". every track bangs and he even worked with Just Blaze before he blew up, which i think is a plus. every track also is a lesson of it own contemplation. for example ""Gotta Eat"" is the struggle track along with ""Hard Times"" are both great at capturing the urban struggle. then you have ""What Part of The Game?"" is a track dissing the fakeness in the industry with Ras Kass providing his own unique perspective along with ""Bop Your Head"" feat Canibus showing how to tear apart phony emcees. both emcees rip the track with ease. to those who wanted the same actual fact type ideogram of lp that Priest bought for previously i'm sorry this is the next best thing. favorite tracks on ""View From Masada"" are1.Whut Part of The Game?2.Bop Your Head3.Rap Legend4.Live by the gun5.I'm Wit That"
2,fallen,Killah Priests first cd (heavy mental) is my favorite cd of all time but this cd is terrible. The only good song is macabean revault. KP has lost sight of his wisdom in this cd. Its like hes trying to turn into a gangster rapper.
5,This is a great cd.,"At one time, I thought Hanson were really dumb. Well, I tried listening to their music and scrapped that idea. They can sure put out some GREAT music! I like it because it's not like most pop. It sounds real, not canned, and that's 'cause they actually write their own songs and play their own instruments. If you decided you didn't like Hanson after hearing MMMBop, you should really try this cd. The songs are so much more grownup, and the boys don't sound like girls anymore."
5,This Time Around...........ROCKS!,"I LOVE THIS CD! I got it last night and now I can't stop listening to it. When Hanson was really popular around 1997 I was a fan, then i wasn't for awhile......but somehow I became a major fan again, but I'm glad that I did. This Time Around is totally different than MON, it isn't pop its more rock. I would recommend this CD to anyone even people that aren't Hanson fans, they should give Hanson another chance because this CD is different. I have even made my sister and cousins Hanson fans by playing the CD over and over they began to like it and were asking to borrow my CD. Ok well one last thing......HANSON ROCKS!!"
5,You'd never know it was Hanson,"I've been a Hanson fan since Middle of Nowhere, but this CD proves what they can do. Jumping leaps and Bounds above previous CDs, This Time Around is an amazing piece of work.The music and vocals are amazing, But it's the Lyrics that shine on this Album. ""A Song To Sing"" is one of the prettiest songs I've ever heard.My friends that hate Hanson actully enjoyed this CD. They grew up, and it shows. It's an amazing CD. It's really worth every penny!"
4,I just can't believe it....,"I go to school where these guys are from, and I have no idea how something so hard can come out of a place so....hick. They kick some serious ass and I have tons of friends that know them, so SUPPORT THE BAND - BUY THE ALBUM!"
5,Fascinating work about evil,"I found this book to be one of Zelazny's best, and one of my favorite books in general. It achieves a very difficult task: getting the reader to like and sympathize with an evil protagonist. Despite the unspeakable acts he committs, and the unsavory characters he associates with, you find yourself liking him. Definitely worth reading."
4,Comfortable pack,"As soon as you open the bag you can feel the quality of the Kata-102. I'm comfortable my camera and gear is safely ensconsed with in the soft yellow padding and tough outer shell. I do wish there were more ancillary storage spaces for things like my Copperhill cleaning kit, camera and flash manuals, extra batteries, charger, various cables, etc. The inside of the cover does have a narrow storage compartment but it would be better if it was broken into smaller compartments instead of one big one. Things tend to fall out when you're lokking for something.The straps are very comfortable and seem to displace the weight very well. It is a high quality product and should serve its owner well for many years."
1,You get what you pay for,"There's a reason it's only half the price of its nearest competitor. The description says ""sturdy construction"" -- it's lying."
3,"No kana version? Argh, romanji.","I'm using the highly excellent Japanese for Busy People I--KANA Version. Very good. So why would I want to then use a workbook that's not a kana version but uses romanji? (as far as I can tell from the excerpt, please correct me if I'm wrong) No good.I'm sad... Anyway, I didn't go to the work of learning kana so I could get bogged down with romanji this far along in my studies."
1,disapointed,"the books came eariler than what i was expected, but I was disapointed.because there is no cover, so so condition. but it was written on it.maybe, I did miss reading condition of the books. but it was poor quality."
2,Useless for me,"I am in the FIRST chapter of my calculus textbook and trying to do the homework, and the book can't even help me with that. How can a real calculus review only dedicate 6 pages to limits/continuity (not even 6 pages for each) if limits are the basis of all calculus?Maybe the derivatives part of the book would be useful. It seems to focus a lot on that. But I can't even get there because I can't understand limits enough to pass my homework."
4,Nice comfortable dress/casual hat,"This is a nice comfortable hat. Folks have told me they like it better than my other hats...whatever that means. Large fits 7 3/8 nicely. Other larges sometimes are too large, if you know what I mean. The only drawback that I have found... If you have a cat, the darn hairs will float, no matter where you hang it, and stick. So, you will probably need to invest in a small brass wire brush. I purchased the black hat. The brown would probably not show cat hairs very much. No cat? Then the hat deserves 5 stars!"
5,Great Buy,I really like this hat. It fits nice and is comfortable. Manufactured from good materials. I ordered the extra large and I normally wear a 7 3/8 hat. If anything the extra large might be considered a little small so don't downsize your size.
3,Low crown!,"I now know what low crown means!!! Nice hat, packs nice, looks good, just has the low crown, meaning the top of my head presses up on the bottom of the crown and, for me, it doesnt feel like it is all the way on so I am constantly adjusting trying to make it feel right. I still like it with my button down shirts just will order a higher crown next time.Charlie"
3,Warning ...,"This is not really a review as I have been unable to watch the DVD yet. This is just to point out that although the product description says 'all regions' it is made in Germany and does not play on my Canadian DVD player. I'm lucky enough to have some access to a 'all region' player and will be able to watch it on that, but am very disappointed that I was mis-lead."
1,Opteka Telephoto lens,This Opteka telephoto lens is made in China and is very poor quality.All my shots had lots of distortion and chromatic aberration.Your pictures look like they were taken on a toy camera with a very bad plastic lens.This was a complete waste of money!
1,Product fine; seller was a problem,"It took 4 weeks to get a simple part from these people. On their initial shipment they did not send me tracking information, so when the shipment was damaged by UPS neither they nor I knew anything about the halted shipment for another week after it happened. Then they took 4 days to ship a replacement, and sent it via ground, which took another 5 days. Don't order from them if you need something on a schedule.Oh, the product was fine."
5,Golden touch in the Silver Age,This is some of the best early Thor with the introduction of Crusher Kreel and Hercules and on into a space saga and Ego Prime. This is the stuff that established Thor as a Marvel cornerstone. During this time the Tales of Asgard provided a growing establishment of the mythic Asgardian world re-imagined from the Norse tales that Walter Simonson would later bring to great crescendo. Add to this all the fate of Jane Foster. This is one of Thor's greatest ages. Thor's relationship with Hercules and father Odin are also the stuff of great writing. Ego Prime and the High Evolutionary become staples of the Marvel future mythos from their origins here.
5,This is size A!,"The Intex Website shows this:Item No. For Filter Pump Models Dimensions Type59900 02, 12/12R, 108R 04-1/4"" x 8"" AThe Amazon website shows this to be for 12R/108R pumps. Easy enough to figure out!"
1,Very Poor Product,"this part didnt fit easily, then turned it on and it burnt within 30 seconds.I returned it, they threw me around like they didn't care too much, then sent a check that had the wrong date, couldn't cash it, then finally sent a good check.good waste of 2 months of projector use and a few bucks wasted!all parts are not factory and will not work like they should...stay away..."
2,Learning Polish is a daunting task,"Any way you look at it, to a complete novice, learning Polish is difficult. The book seems fairly well-laid out, but there is just not enough Polish on the cds to be helpful. Each lesson is approximately four minutes long. The dialogue goes by too fast to be comprehended and it seems that there is more English on them than Polish. That is annoying when I have to keep replaying the lessons."
3,Not Compelling Enough For Drabble,"First of all this is my second Drabble book. I read ""The Seven Sisters"" and was delighted. Drabble has the bitter tone down cold. Simply put, I like how she captures the emotion of ""heartlessness."" But in ""The needles eye"" i've been having a hard time not getting distracted. It's not as followable. It reads like an old novel, like something people might have liked to read one hundred years ago. I keep forgetting who is the central character- rose or simon- and what's going on- and why I care about the Rose's legal problems. And why does Simon seem to be enamored of rose, and is there going to be an illicit sex scene here or not? And if Simon is just realizing that Rose and her ex-husband are meant for one another, what is the point? Who is Emily? I'm disappointed that it's not compelling enough. I want more exploration of Simon.... He is too invisible and yet he is the only thing that holds my interest ."
3,"some great tracks, but too much filler","I wish I could rate this higher, I really do, because there really is some good stuff on here. It's still worth buying, even though it's far from their best album. Tunes like ""riot on broadstreet"", ""skeleton song"", ""Let me Be"", and the big radio-hit ""So Sad To Say"" are up there with some of the best songs the bosstones have ever laid down, but the abundance of filler material really weigh it down. Had they ditched maybe six of the sixteen tracks, we would've had a killer album on our hands here, but listening to the whole thing straight through becomes somewhat of a chore. I still reccommend it and maybe others out there will actually get something out of the whole thing. I hope their next one is tighter, but for right now, ""Pay Attention"" will do just fine. The skip button sure does come in handy, though."
2,Good until Warranty wore out,"This microwave worked very well until the 13th Month. (one month after warranty for parts and labor) The microwave quit working. All the other features work fine but the microwave quit heating. I was told by Sharp that I need to call a local repair shop, which I did. Sharp will replace the magnatron but will not cover the labor which is just about the cost of a standard microwave. Too bad for me. Anyways it's decision time to see if we want all the features this has and spend about 100.00 or buy new. I must say that I have never had a microwave oven quit after only 1 year, even a cheap one. Not sure if I just got a bad unit or just not a good durable unit to begin with."
4,"Sharp R-820JS .9-Cubic Foot Grill 2 Convection Microwave, Silver",Great all around microwave for singles. The only thing it does not do well is microwave popcorn.
5,Wow! Great little microwave/oven for the price!,"I ordered this microwave two days before Thanksgiving Day, and to my astonishment it arrived the very next day! I just love it. So far I have cooked frozen veggies, reheated lasagne, baked bread with the convection setting,(came out really great), and heated and reheated all sorts of things. Just a nice product at a great price. Thanks Amazon for coming to the rescue for my holiday dinner!"
1,DULL,Had this microwave for 2 years. The grill feature gives VERY uneven results - stick to your bbQ grill. It takes a long time to heat anything up and as I found out this week - it cannot pop a bag of popcorn - even a small bag. Each snack size popcorn bag took 5 minutes and then less than half the kernels popped.Will be replacing this with anything but a Sharp.
4,pleased with purchase,"My wife and I are very pleased with this purchase. The price at amazon was the best we found at the time. It arrived very quickly. This little oven has so many features and once you learn them food prep is a snap. We used this product to replace a micowave gone bad. Once it arrive though, we were able also to donate our toaster oven and save space.One item we wished was better was the noise level. We understand the oven needs to cool itself and accept the trade off of having a multifunctional device. The fan probably runs so long for safety. But it can be a bit noisey for a while after your through cooking with the device.One note to potential buyers, reconize its wattage. We went from a higher wattage microwave and had to readjust our cooking time a little to make up for the lower power level. The trade off is well worth have a microwave that microwaves, grills, toast, acts as a convection oven, defrost very nicely, and can do a combination of these."
4,Sharp Convection Microwave,"I love this Sharp convection/microwave oven. Since I purchased it I have not used my oven or outside grill. I have used it for roasting, baking, grilling, etc. and everything comes out perfect."
1,"It was fine, while it worked - Where's customer service?????","I got this DVD player during an after Thanksgiving sale for around 60 dollars. I thought it was a great deal for a portable DVD player. We bought it to use on long car trips for the kids to watch movies. I thought it was fine initially, I didn't really notice any problem with the volume. However, after using it on approx 5 car trips, it will now only work if we use a piece of duct tape to hold the lid down over the DVD. Some sensor went bad and even if the lid is closed it still says it's open. Some might wonder why I didn't call customer service for help. Therein lies the main reason I give this product 1 Star -- NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. I tried the number in the manual - I get a recording that the number is not in service. I looked up Spectroniq's website and tried that number also got the same message no service. I will never buy a product by this company again, and I feel really bad for people who bought expensive products from them."
1,Think Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"I had to throw the whole case out.I'm not unusually sensitive, but they are so high in hydrolyzed vegetable protein (the ingredient-list euphemism for MSG) that even a small amount used as seasoning was enough to set off a major 24-hour case of ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome."" Not worth the risk."
2,Worst DMX album,"I don't know so many people think this cd is so good. I bought it and was very disapointed. The only good songs on here are ""What's my name"" and ""Party Up,"" the rest of the songs are below average. I never listen to this cd, but I love It's Dark and Hell is Hot and The Great Depression. This cd has a million stupid skits and no good songs. I think everyone likes this cd so much is because they don't know good rap. If you want something good, go buy a Bone Thugs n Harmony or Tech N9ne cd."
1,this is hiphop at its worst,the beats are wack! the lyrics a 2 year old could write BUY STILL I RISE BY TUPAC & OUTLAWZ IF YOU BUY STILL I RISE EMAIL ME AND ILL PAY YOU TNE DOLLARS
1,This is sad,I bought it's dark and hell is hot it was a great album. this album is far fetched to say the least only a couple of good songs here the hooks are too repetitive and the album seems a little rushed Production wise ok but lyrically there are more unsigned mc's with more talent than this cat!
1,Not good at all,"Want to buy the same album OVER AND OVER AND OVER.. buy the three DMX cds...if you want real music.. buy the 2Pac/Outlawz CD that came out the same day as this ""barking"" garbage.. cause if you have DMX's first 2 you HAVE this one already"
5,NEVER EVER compare DMX to Jay-Z or 2pac,"I have great love for 2pac..and have Jay-z's Vol. 2 and will have 3. And then there was X cannot be compared to 2pac's work. Not to say that his work is bad, but 2pac has a different style. And what did you expect? Jay-z will rap fast, DMX will be agressive and always have a prayer, and Hot boys will always talk about jewelry. It's which one of these you cal relate to, that makes you a fan. I am a fan of DMX. he helped me. This is a great album...non-fans WILL be turned over. Garunteed. Just don't confuse X with others. Or others with X. One love"
1,wack..........,"Once again, another album put out by the notorious ""dog barker""...............i dont know what people see in this. He gots no skillz. Dont waste your money on this. Buy 2pac instead."
1,What is this?,"What does everyone see in this guy? Dude has no talent at all. All he does is bark like a dog in every song, and every song sounds the same. And why is he claimen thug? He aint no thug! The problem with dmx is, if you buy one of his albums, you've BOUGHT EM ALL! He also needs to stop yelling in every song and concentrate on his lyrics. Now, if you want REAL, true talent, buy a Bone Thugs N Harmony cd. Now thats a group with talent. And their new cd is coming out Feb. 29th. Dmx could NEVER touch Bone if his life depended on it. Thats my word........................"
1,Complete wackness,"Since his first album, DMX has been heading downhill. Without doubt this is his worst release to date. This album lacks originality. If you really want, you can buy it and hear all the same thugged out sh1t that you can get on most other hip hop releases (including DMX's).Most of the beats on this are worse than previous albums, and DMX just recycles the exact same formula that he used on his previous two albums. Worse is the hypocrisy on his tracks. In one he talks about how it doesn't matter how much you pay for what you have and how rich you are, but then on another track the theme is getting money.Everybody's already heard about getting money, getting women, killing enemies. If DMX wasn't going to say anything new, why did he bother making this album at all?If you want some good hip hop, check out Mos Def or Gang Starr, because this is definitely an album to miss."
4,AND THEN THERE WAS A LEGEND,"THIS ALBUM REALLY BROUGHT OUT THE MORE EMOTIONAL SIDE OF DMX, EVERY SONG IS HOT AND I REALLY LIKE FAME AND MORE 2 A SONG. MORE 2 A SONG EXPLAINS LIFE IS NOT ALL ABOUT MONEY,GIRLS,AND HOW MANY CARS YOU GOT. THAT SONG IS DEDICATED TO ALL THE FAKE CHUMP ASS RAPPERS OUT THERE. X KEEP DOING YOUR THING DOG."
4,still coming raw wit it,"For it bieng DMX'S 3rd album, it is one of the best-just as was his 1st album. I would have to say that this one does top them all. I expect more albums from DMX like ""And Then There Was X"""
1,How do you go from It's dark to this?,"I thought you are supposed to get better not worse with every disc but DMX put out it's dark and hell is hot (one of the best cd's I have EVER heard)then does blood and then this it's just sad and I am starting to understand where kurupt is coming from.There is nothing that even comes close to it's dark,no damien no talks to god no nothing he is definately following the east coast puff daddy jigga fall off every year trend at least da WU TANG will be able to hold down a piece of da east because the WEST IS back on top where we should be.Sincerly Calvin Brodus AKA Snoop Dogg."
1,Where's the 0 star option?,"What the Heck is this? The only half decent song on this album is "" What's My Name""! Don't buy it.Dear God don't buy this CD!"
1,Burned By Skillet,"We bought this skillet while on vacation,what a mistake,I agree with everyone else who gave this thing negative responses. The coating started to peel off after a couple of uses. I wish I could take it back to the store but we were in another state when we bought it. We plan on calling the company and complain but I don't expect much success. DO NOT BUY THIS SKILLET !!!!!"
1,Very unsatisfactory,My rival pan immediately got bowed up in the middle the first time I used. it. It is no longer useable.
1,Planned Obsolescence,"I purchased this skillet at my local Meijer store and felt compelled to leave a review. I agree with the others. After seasoning the pan in advance (per instructions), I made pancakes the next morning - it was a disaster. The center is slightly raised (probably to allow grease to drain), but that caused my batter to spill to the sides. Even at 400, it couldn't hold the batter in the center of the pan or brown my pancakes...well it could, but by the time the entire pancake was cooked on one side there was no need to flip it! The concept is admirable (removable server), but this may have been part of the reason it couldn't hold heat. Plus it was more difficult to handle. The removable pan doesn't lock in securely, so I had to remove two pieces of equipment from my cupboard instead of one.I'm glad I hadn't thrown out my old trusty pan. Planned obsolescence really stinks."
1,Still waiting for mine to heat...,"For the price that I paid, I also expected a quality product. However, it is slow to heat and it never gets really hot enough. I agree with all the reviewers. I wish I'd read the other product reviews as well. Looks like and is priced like a winner, but a total loser."
1,"Too bad Rival, nice idea, poor implimentation","I hate this product. Although, the pan has only been used a few times, I am getting rid of it. My time is more valuable than the grief this pan causes: 1) it doesn't heat consistently 2) it is raised in the center and liquids run to the sides 3) the non-stick coating is a joke. I loved the idea of the removable pan and the glass lid, but the product performs so poorly I refuse to use it. At this point, I am willing to pay 3 times as much for product that will work."
1,Do not waste your money,"I bought this skillet 6 months ago and I have already thrown it out! Everything, even with cooking spray stuck to it from the beginning. Then the surface started to scratch even with non metal utensils. Now, there is very little surface left, down to the raw metal. It always burned things in the middle and didn't cook good along the outside edges. I wasted $50 and I'm so disappointed I will never buy another Rival product!!"
1,RUN AWAY!!!,"This is the absolute WORST skillet I have ever owned by far. In short, YES, it is raised in the middle so everything runs to the sides... YES, absolutely everything sticks no matter what you do.. YES, it does not heat evenly at all. We have owned it for maybe 2 months and we are just so fed up that we have to buy a new one.. UGH!"
1,not very durable,"I bought the skillet to replace my last rival skillet that the teflon finally wore down after 5 years of heavy use,with the new skillet after a month the teflon started bubbling and flaking. Rival sent me out a replacement at no charge which has bubbled after the first use,i never heated the skillet over 350 and used a nylon spatula seems awfully cheap for a 50 dollarpan"
1,A disapointed burer,"After owning a Rival electric skillet for several years I needed a new one, so I bought a new one. The heat transfer to the removable skillet is so poor that I'm now looking for a new electric skillet.I guess I'll have to try another brand."
1,The joke Is On The Customer!,I love the 5 start reviews for this piece of garbage..Wat a couple of weeks till the coating starts flaking off..Takes forever to heat..after about 6 weeks I threw this junk in the garbage.....Talk about cheap Chinese crap..This is the poster boy for junk.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SKILLET,"I got this skillet as a Christmas present and it doesn't work. It heats to where you can't touch it but doesn't cook anything. It took over an hour at 400 degrees to cook thin hamburger patties. Won't fry, won't sizzle, can't even smell food cooking. We've also tried potatoes, onions, bacon... nothing cooks. Total waste of money. I do not recommend this product!!!! Way too much money for a piece of garbage!"
2,Rival S16RB 12-by-16-Inch Oblong-Shaped Electric Skillet with Removable Pan,Doesn't get as hot as my old Rival Skillet.Takes a long time to brown anything.
1,One use. Returning it.,"I received this as a present and went to cook bacon in it on it. The bacon only cooked in the middle of the slice, leaving the ends mostly raw.I am returning it and purchasing one that has much better reviews."
1,Keep looking,This was a replacement for a similar rival skillet we had with a removable pan that had a griddle for a base. I loved that one but the non-stick surface wore off. So I bought this one. It works but it sucks. I like the convenience of taking just the pan off to wash it like our old one. But everything else about it sucks. Takes FOREVER to warm up and the center of the pan is taller and hotter than the edges. So everything runs to the sides where they don't get cooked as well. After having it a month and probably using it a dozen times the non-stick is not so non-stick any longer. The other one lasted about 3 years before this started happening. I see this one going in the trash in another month or two.
5,One of Elmore's best!,"Elmore Leonard is a renowned Mystery Writer but HOMBRE is a Western classic that brings out the best of the hard life in the days of cowboys. Leonard's crisp, no excess dialog puts the characters at the center of his stories. Tension, feelings, the rugged life and land all come through his characters.Elmore Leonard is a master and anyone who wants to liv in a story should read his works!"
5,A classic western,"For me, Hombre is one of the best novels that I have ever read. Life sometimes offers things that you wish would never end, and this book is one of those things. Leonard created a memorable hero in John Russell who is the stuff that legends are made of. This is a must read for anyone who can appreciate the Western genre on any level or anyone looking for a good read period."
5,¡Excelente!,Well written. Saw the movie with Paul Newman many moons ago and also liked it. Didn't know Leonard had written this book...
5,Best Bengali writing learning book out there,a bengali writing book at par with american preschool/kindergarten books. Must have for bengali-american kids.
4,Looks good and very easy to install,"I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the finished edges which are a little frayed in areas. However, it's not noticeable. The canopy is AMAZINGLY easy to install and fits perfectly with my California King and vaulted ceilings. I truly did not think it would touch the floor and it does, with a little room to spare. It's really a great purchase for such a wonderful price."
2,Worth a try considering the price but not a solution in my case,"Every canopy bed is different. Ours has 4 post with curtian rods connecting each post. This item doesnt have rod sleves and hangs from post to post. The middle is solid so from overhead looking up there its covered from post to post by fabric. This creates several challenges, 1) what to do about the sag from post to post and 2) What to do with the sagging center top fabric. It comes with some hooks to attach the center to the ceiling but our celing was too high to use them. Bottom line is if you have a low ceiling or a bed with several slats across the top you'll get this to fit. Else, you in for problems and will need a sewing machine to make adjustments.I wound up buying sheer drapes to hang from our canopy bed rods. The quality certianly isnt bad for the price but its not a one size fits all situation."
3,Hangs too low,"I read some of the reviews that said it was too big for a full size, it hangs too low, etc. But I thought since I have a king size bed that I'd be okay. Not so. On a king size four poster bed the top still hangs far too low - about two feet above the bed. I made it work by tying the top parts to the sides (thus creating a hole the shape of a diamond in the top) using the ties provided, but this has made it not as pretty as it could be, and absolutely non-functional as a mosquito net."
2,Not pleased,"The material is cheaper looking and instructions are a joke, like another poster said. I literally had to hold the canopy drapes on my posts with hair bands! I also placed two sheets on the top and front post to give me a greater sense of coziness. I looked for a better canopy curtain prior to this one. I wanted something thicker and romantic looking. It does look romantic and it goes well with my bed color. However, the difficulty of putting it up and the very thin material made me dissatisfied."
1,doesn't look like the picture,This product looked very cool when I saw it on the computer. I was extremely dissapointed when I opened the box and saw that it was a crappy piece of netting that I could have bought at the dollar store. It looks nothing like the picture and definately not worth the money! I would not reccomend this product to anyone.
3,canopy top,Fast delivery. I got this for a full sized bed and it's a bit big. Would be great for a queen size. Other then the size issue it's good.
4,Parents love it,"Got this for my parents for the month of december along with a couple other red buffalo coffees. They seem to really like it and my mom says that it has a rich flavor, but at the same time doesnt taste like a synthetic flavor.They love it"
3,Album sounds very R. Kelly-ish,"This was a good first effort for his debut. But most of the time Avant sounds too much like his Chicago competitor R. Kelly, since this album was recorded in the same city. The same bump and grind themes so common in R's songs are felt within this album. Steve Huff's production wasn't as well known in 2000 before his 2001 assault on three different albums. But it showed Avant's promise as an R&B singer and he has gotten better. Album #2 is really his best."
4,Brilliant,"The story of Hemingway's last years lets you enter a world of desillusion, faked grandeur and, ultimately, madness.It seems as if the reader was present at the scenes which are brilliantly depicted by Reynolds.Getting to know the life of Hemingway lets you add a supplementary dimension to the reading of his works."
5,great product,"I bought these for some slingback heels I have. They're soft and cushioned enough given that the shoes are not that comfortable. I was surprised that a coworker noticed the clear strap immediately, as I didn't think it was that noticeable (or that she was that observant). They've held up fine to a few washings."
5,Had to hide from kids!,"Similar to another brand, I had to hide it from the kids! They enjoy with peanut or almond butter, on toast and even pancakes. Nice creamy but not oily taste.Very pleased with the product."
4,Hilarious and kinda gory,"Hilarious horror comedy about a creepy looking guy in a ""Gremlin"" mask trying to spook people who enter his woods. He also runs around the whole time in his underwear which only adds to the hilarity. Competently made and acted with a decent amount of quality gore scenes. Also features a ridiculous Gremlin training montage with various horror monsters played by guys in cheap masks. As far as low budget horror comedies go The Gremlin is a winner."
1,Cut! Cut! Cut!,Don't bother with this! The movie had been cut to pieces in the transfer. The trailer at the end shows you how much is missing.
1,Don't usually like to put negative reviews but HATED this shaver,"I had the Panasonic ES-SA40-K before and loved the shaver. However, it didn't seem to be available anymore so I thought I'd try this cheaper one out. I saw the good reviews and thought it's worth a shot. The first time I tried it though, I couldn't even use it. It kept pulling my hair and it HURT. I've never had such an uncomfortable shave before. Had to return instantly. Not sure if anyone else had the problem but wanted to share my own experience."
3,fair shaver,"This shaver works best when the battery is kept fully charged, that beihg said it takes time to get a semi close shave"
1,1970 -1980,"Please provide the titles of the songs on this CD then I will be guided on the review, otherwise I would like to make an order after knowing the the songs content. Thanks in advance."
5,The old country,"If you have ever wanted to know what it feels like to go to Texas Tech or spend time in west Texas buy this CD. Lukes first two CD's are great and this is his best work yet! I think the best song on here ""If you belive in me"" has something in it for everyone. Adios"
5,A wonderful piece of pure art,"You simply can't have better songs and arrangements, also track numer 3 is worth the entire CD... Mulligan and Piazzolla is a magic mixture :)"
1,give me a break,"I can suspend disbelief as well as anyone, but I find it very hard to believe that anyone with a brain would live in the desert with no running water. I also found it impossible to believe a scene where Blue lets a friend make her an outfit out of smelly used clothes. And the police hiring her just because she found some statistics that didn't match??? The book didn't work for me."
4,Baby LOVES it!,"I bought this mobile because I loved the way it looked and I hoped our little girl would like it well enough. I never would have guessed our little girl would LOVE it as much as she does: M is 6 weeks old and smiles and gurgles away at the little mouse and bear. I'm starting to suspect that she likes this mobile and her little friends more than she likes me! :(This mobile can be found for a few dollars less elsewhere, but I'd say any dollar you spend on this is money well spent.The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because no hook or other means of attaching the mobile to the ceiling or a crib is included in the box and the string is FAR too short to hang directly from the ceiling (we have ours situated above our diaper changing station). It was easy enough to find a way to hang it, but it seems like the string should be longer (trimmable) and a hook should be included."
5,Missing Hologram?,"Did anyone purchase Season 1 Volume 2 with the hologram on the outside of the box? My copies of Season 1 Volume 1 and Season 2 Volume 1 have them, so I am curious why this one does not."
3,Not as high quality as I would have liked,"I loved this show and taped the whole series off of the tv when it was on. I got these sets because I thought they would have to be better than my home-made discs, but they aren't. They might even be worse. Lion-O's anointment trials are spread out every five episodes instead of all shown back-to-back. I know they were aired that way, but they shouldn't have been. In the season one, volume two box (the blue one), I ended up with two copies of the first disc and no copy of the third disc. That is a very weird error that I've never run into before. Anyway, if anyone ends up with two copies of the third disc and none of the first, maybe we can arrange a swap."
1,"terrible, chemical-like flavor","OK, so I'm spoiled by Gevalia's German Chocolate Cake coffee. (Unfortunately, they only have theirs seasonally). So I went looking for something comparable, tried Coffee Masters and am still looking. To my taste, there was no hint of any velvety-smooth coffee flavor nor of German Chocolate Cake. Just harsh chemical flavored brown stuff. Sorry."
5,"yeah, it's real, real good . . .","Put this album on your ears, you won't be disappointed. ""Sun's Work Undone"" and ""Alabama Shamrock"" are masterpieces in their own right, but can't begin to define this album or these ""boys"" . . . ."
5,Perfect!,I have several good brand knives but this is the best one I have ever owned. Super sharp and sturdy.
1,Noam Chomsky is an idiot,"This book was a mandatory read for my propaganda class at UCLA. If colleges didn't force people to read this smut, his book would be even lower than his 1800 on amazon.com. Noam Chomsky's whole argument is based on cause correlation which is an inherently flawed way to measure the media's reporting. Chomsky believes that when one event occurs it is directly related to another. Anybody who understands how to do research knows that you can't rely on this method to make valid conclusions. To make up for this discrepancy, Chomsky repeats himself a thousand times throughout the book. This book gets my lowest score. I highly recommend Anne Coulter's book Slander which does a much better job of explaining biases in the media. She presents facts explaining how the media is liberal, not conservative."
5,camera battery,camera guickly and fit correctly in camera. Charged up as desired and is holding charge. Would order from here again.
2,"Works, but...",It does not last nearly as long as the rated Ah implies. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Good book but another new one is better,"This book is good, but it is out of print. A new book, ""Genuine Gold"" by Paul L. King, is an excellent book on the same topic. As an Alliance pastor, I stongly recommend it if you want to know the true early history of the Alliance. I was excited when I read of the early years of the Holy Spirit working powerfully in the C&MA."
1,"DVD ""not compatible""","I finally got around to trying the DVD that was shipped to me in June. I've tried it on two DVD players - they both tell me this DVD is not compatible. I have never had this happen before when ordering through Amazon. It was definitely a waste of money... So word to the wise, before placing your order, make sure your DVD will be compatible with your DVD player."
3,"Eh, just ok","This video was a bit of a let-down to me. I didn't think the girls were that fantastic, and the scenes were just ok. Maybe because the video is a bit older? If I had had a chance to see it before buying it, I wouldn't have purchased it..."
2,A great disapointment,"If your expecting a P.O.D. like in Fundamental Elements of Southtown or Satelite, then don't buy this cd.What you'll get is a slow and mellow p.o.d., and not the hard hitting and exploding p.o.d. that we know.Out of the 11 songs 'Will You' and Asthema are the only 2 songs that come at least close to the old p.o.d. Don't waste your money on this album, instead burn it and you be the jugde."
1,Old parfume.,This perfume was old and smelled bad. The bottle was leaking and the box was all wrinkled without wrapping.I was very unhappy with this purchase.
1,not worth it,"I bought this book after using the study guide that the state sent out, which wasn't much. It had totally different type questions than the state study guide. I was worried that I hadn't studied the right things, so I reviewed this book and took the test. This book did not help me at all. It had me studying the rules of grammar, sentence structure and punctuation type things. None of that was on the test. The test was mostly on how to teach English, strategies and such."
3,"Love the show, hated the ending - SPOILER","I have been a faithful watcher of this show from the beginning and have really enjoyed it. I live overseas and have been anxiously awaiting the DVD to come out so I could watch it. I enjoyed the season but I could not get over the ending. It left such a bad and negative taste in my mouth. I by no means need rainbows and butterflies and expect a happy ending, but WHAT? I don't understand what the purpose of it was, the way it happened seemed a bit far fetched. I think if it was going to happen it would be at the hands of an extremist or an angry resident of Juniper Creek. Maybe it was the way the left Margene that left the bad taste in my mouth more. Something that was also nagging on me is what on earth are these women to do now? Margene is what, 22? Will she never marry again, or will they try to find a man that will marry them all? That's another issue entirely but regardless, I was dissapointed."
4,Hooked Again on an HBO Series!,"I said I wasn't going to do it, but it happened again with Big Love. I enjoyed the ride, but a tradition that began with the Sopranos, HBO writers don't end a series well. Final episodes seem to just ""push us off a cliff"" and it's just over! The final season of Big Love got to be a bit overwhelming with the story lines, but still riveting. Yet, on the final episode, instead of giving us a 90min conclusion to some intense stories, they crammed everything into the same time frame as the series format and just abruptly stopped each story line, cold! Oh well, I enjoyed ride, just the same!"
2,Bad Disk,"Just when you wonder what else could possibly go wrong, season five brings the family to the brink on a number of levels. The climax caught me by surprise. The flash-forward denouement was a little abrupt.We were disappointed by a quality problem with the final disk in the set. It locked up in several episodes, and we therefore missed some of the action."
3,easy to read but...,"This book is easy to read but don't expect to learn how to do the actual tests. If you only want to know what a test is about, this is a good book to start with. It only covers basic parametric and non-parametric tests.One mistake that I found - Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is treated as an alternative to t-test, which is misleading. K-S test is for testing distributions not the means or medians. Though this is a common mistake, it should not come from a statistic book.Not worth the money!"
1,an unsatisfactory purchase,"This tension rod is thin and very weak. It could not hold itself up. Sadly, I will be returning it."
2,not so good,"I bought this as a holiday gift for a friend in 2006. She's not overly picky about her coffee, but in 2007 right before Christmas she let me know it wasn't very good and to PLEASE not purchase more for her because it didn't taste good. :("
1,Terrible terrible film,"Panned by the Hollywood Reporter as follows: ""Stenn, an accomplished TV writer-producer with an ebullient personality that doesn't wear well, undercuts his material by putting himself front and center -- he has more screen time than Douglas. Stenn films himself pacing in his hotel room, thinking out loud in the car and, in a lapse of taste, dancing on Ross' grave. Declarations of his good intentions, however genuine, come across as self-serving. There's certainly a whiff of exploitation here.""For me, this film made me feel pretty repulsed, a woman who was exploited by one man is exploited all over again by the repulsive David Stenn (he's the writer of Vanilla Ice vehicle Cool As Ice by the way)."
3,Sad in many ways,"The saddest aspect of this story is how thoroughly ruined Patricia Douglas's life was. I feel so sorry for her beautiful daughter, who bore the brunt of her mother's emotional damage. Not only did she suffer as a child from her stepfather's depredations, but she seemed to receive no love or support from her mother the entire time her mother was alive. It's a shame that someone as strong-willed as Patricia Douglas was, in standing up to her attacker and the studio to try and receive justice, could not put the pieces of her broken life back together. Why she treated her own daughter so badly is hard to fathom, but it appeared in the movie that her daughter was able break the cycle and be a loving mother herself. It's sad that her mother never let her within her emotional walls, while the filmmaker, David Stenn, somehow charmed his way in.Overall a compelling and tragic story, but it would have been better had the filmmaker not injected himself so much into the story."
1,Slurping Sexist,"If you can stand extremely off colored 'jokes' about how you should try oral, the degradation of term changes in the UCC to make it more gender neutral and listening to this guys slurp and swallow something every few minutes this is the Sales review for you!If not, look for something else. This isn't worth supporting."
1,I'm sooo disappointed!,"I've four different DVD's from Waves, and they are good! Really good!This one is terrible. First of all, it's boring.Introduction is forever; breaks between segments (or days) are even longer. Beaches are my second problem with this DVD - where they came from? Is this what Hawaii is all about? Lake Helen in Wisconsin looks better."
4,Great album,"This was a pumping, heart racing album that is a good album to put into your collection if you're a techno or electronica fan. Very energetic and good music goes together like peas and carrots."
5,Great for the new Navy Spouse,"This is the perfect book for the new Navy Spouse. Tells you everything you need to know. Now, I just have to get my copy back from my friend who also is new and loves it!"
5,an awesome story no ordinary teen goes through,"Ceres is a very interesting story, that talks about twins aki and aya, and how they will discover that they are no ordiany teenagers like others, and that they have powers that is beyond what they are expecting, it si really interesting,I recommend it for who is interested in drama and lots of comedy."
2,A Surprise Failure,"Unlike ""Fushigi Yugi"", one of my favorite manga titles, this one really falls flat. This is generic shoujo at it's blandest; not the worst title I've picked up, but not even good in an average way. Bypass it and read Yu Watase's far superior ""Fushigi Yugi"". Hopefully the next title of hers to be released, here, will be one less boring than ""Ceres""."
2,Don't bother,This pad really isn't that great. I was surprised by how small it really was. The tent isn't cheap but the footprint feels that way.
4,scooby game,"We enjoy playing this game. It helps to have more than two players because more players increases the chances of one's gamepiece being returned to the start. This aspect of the game helps my four year old son, who is a huge scooby-do fan, deal with set backs. I only wish it was simpler to take apart and put back together again. We have left it set up and out of the way when we're not playing the game."
3,Scooby Haunted House game,"Very fun concept for a game. It is pretty simple to play, but the board is very shakey. The side panels fall off and the ghost does not click down as the instructions say. Overall, a fun game, just not very sturdy."
1,Like Totaly Worthless,"Please spare yourself the agony of this poor excuse of a toy. I can't say enough bad things. Took my wife 1 hour of trying to put together before she gave up. I managed to get it together in about 20 minutes. Beware, you will need a micro scope to read the directions. It's so small an un-legible there may as well be no directions.Once the game is together it's very flimsy and poorly bilt. This game was obviously never tested by children when it was being produced. B/c had it, it never would have been made. I couldn't even push the ghost on top down without pieces of the game falling apart. Forget a kid doing it.My 2 boys are huge Scooby Doo fans. They couldn't wait to play it. Even my 5 yeard old is quoting as saying, ""this game's a piece of junk.""Save your kids the disapointment and stay far away from this garbage."
1,Great fun if you like to waste your time and money,"This game was only fun for my family insofar as we laughed and laughed every time another piece fell off. Every time someone had to push the ghost down, one of us would yell, ""call the repairman!"" Traps almost spring, hinges jam, and players fall off the board (creating amusing family controversy over which player used to be on which space). One of the most fun and entertaining challenges of this game was trying to figure out where the players start, which is not indicated on the board or in the instructions. The game is especially fun for four players, as the instructions state that players may not occupy the same space, and must therefore stack up behind one another in a delightful log-jam configuration. After a rollicking ten minutes of sheer side-splitting frustration, we declared our six-year-old the winner and then selected another game that might tempt us to play it more than once."
2,"Reasonably fun, but a pain","This game is reasonably fun, but a pain to set up and take down. Even worse, it doesn't fit back in the box it came in, and so is a pain to store. All the hassle makes us not want to play it much."
3,Disappointing...,"My son insisted on this toy and to cope with the disappointment of the game, we've turned it into a sort of Scooby Doo ""doll house."" The assembly directions are awful and it falls apart with the slightest bump. I ended up superglueing it together and it became a permanent play fixture for the kids..."
3,Haunted House,The kids have a lot of fun with this game but it falls apart pretty easy. I have to stay close by to put it back together again.
3,Great Concept - Doesn't stay together well,"This game is really cute, but the pieces are hard to put together and they don't stay together well. We were also missing one of the pieces of the castle. Once we got it set up our 5 year old enjoyed playing it."
5,Rapid Charger for Batteries (Olympus Digital Camera),"This is the charger I expected. It replaced my existing one that was burned down from 220V electricity (in London). The charger is excellent, for the price range, and even better, because four additional batteries were included in this package. In some stores just a charger itself will cost more than the entire package, including batteries. Strongly recommended."
1,horrible,when i received this item i opened it and plugged it in n followed the directions to let it charge for 16 hours before 1st use. it did not charge the batteries and the charger itself does not work. dont buy this product!
4,Good beginning guide,"Sampley's book is a good resource for beginning a deaf ministry. It contains a little information about sign language and deaf culture, and ideas for approaches to deaf minstry, including ASL translations of well-known hymns. If you are interested in starting a deaf worship, or adding sign language to your worship service, this book should be one of your resources. This is not a sign language resource, but a deaf ministry resource."
3,A worthwhile read,"As a reader with no particular agenda except that a book be well-written and/or informative, I found Nossiter's latest work to be a bit weak stylistically but strong in reportage.He describes all too well the phenomena of the Emperor's new clothes - townspeople turning a blind eye to the obvious, and rationalizing their actions to an extreme. Shadows of the horrors which occured hang over the selected three towns he visited even today though the people and the physical settings have changed almost beyond recognition.I found especially interesting the part the American Embassy in Vichy and its employees played during these dark days.A book which increases my knowledge of a time and place and which impels me to do further reading on the subject is one I like to recommend to others."
5,Great understanding on procrastination.,"I got many ideas and self-understanding from this book, what I really found helpful was that the author instead on focusing too much on motivation he focus in a different strategy for self-discipline that really works, that is the elimination of self-made psychological roadblocks that create procrastination."
1,Very disappointing book,"The book has more to do with self esteem than self discipline. Boosting your self esteem will motivate you to do more; but the exercises in the book just don't cut it. A better book on self esteem would be ""Self Esteem"" by Mathew McKay.I also found the wording in the book more designed to target children than adults. With references to a mysterious Mr Hyde, when the author is in fact referring to your inner critic. Many statements about the inner critic are duplicated in most chapters, suggesting the author did a lot of cutting and pasting to build up content.All in all this is not good value for money"
5,Simple & Affirming,"This book cuts to the chase, is very easy to understand and is motivating. Self discipline is never fun, but when you see things presented in an easy to understand manner, you see how simple it really can be. I highly recommend this book."
1,Not what I ordered.,I ordered vol 2 and i was vol 1. I sent the book back and hopefully she will send my payment back.
3,Too big,"I thought this item would be cute on my niece's bicycle, but it's actually quite large and awkward on the handlebars. I should have checked the size before ordering."
1,stay away from this.. please,"A piece of real [...]. Never even think of buying this.After lot of difficulties, I could finally point it to the moon. I only saw white light through its eye-piece as much as I can see with my naked eyes!!! The eye piece is so small, it seems as if I poked a hole on a piece of paper and watched a portion of the moon through the paper. And I paid so much money to see that [...]?Then I focussed on a distant star. It just appeared as it would appear through a 4x cheap binocular.Believe me, don't buy a telescope if you live in a city and have enough ""noise"" from other light sources. If you live in a country side, you'd better buy a better telescope and not this [...].I finally sold it on ebay and bought a good pair of Nikon binocular. The moon looks awesome through the Nikon binoculars. Read my other review on Nikon binoculars."
4,very thoughtful,"When I bought this book, I expected to read it in spurts, here and there, in my hectic life as a writer, a widow with four children (three of them teenagers), a boyfriend, an unfinished house.... But I found it so compelling that I read it basically in two sittings. I really appreciate Ms. Swallow's honesty, describing how difficult it was for her to re-marry. I read several times over some passages she wrote about trying to hold on to her own identity. Ms. Swallow helped me think hard about my own situation. I'm going to pass this book on to a friend, but when I get it back I believe I'll read it all over again"
4,not as bad as all that!,"What's the matter guys, no pictures to keep you entertained? It was not as bad as all that really! Entertaining and fast paced.Besides it is really the Editors and Publishers fault for letting all those typos through. I've seen enough of them in the books of the great authors, so this was not really a big deal to me. I live in the area the story is written about and there are alot of creepy things around here..not just Casinos and bars! So this was refreshing. Not just another 'bird' story, or shipwreck."
1,"Awful, dull, and just plain silly","Many reviews have commented on the length of the book. This could have been a good thing if the author had used the many pages to fully develop the ""alternate"" history. Instead the alternate world is barely explained. The book only focus is on the dreary existence of the main character. Just about nothing is explained about how the world came to be like this. I don't think the author has much actual background in history, but instead wanted to write about human suffering. And suffer the READER does -- through endless repetitive pages of mind numbing brutality. I actually threw the book away -- something I have never done. It is truly an awful book - it should get negative stars.Read Harris' ""Fatherland"" (and don't watch the HBO movie)."
2,Accutron,"This is a very nice watch. However, it is not for a man unless he is 2 feet tall and wears his hair in a blue/pink bun. It is the size of an old grandmother's watch. Very dainty and pretty on the wrist, just not for a man."
3,"""Brown-ish""","""Brown-ish"" is the word hovering in my mind from the start till the end of reading this book (or ""Dan-ish"", same meaning anyway). I have the impression that Berry is trying hard to produce a Dan Brown-type story. I've done Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons & Digital Fortress, and there're so many similarities: brutal killings, male main actor helped by a female partner, friend turned out to be betrayer, escape from killers across the continents, riddles that lead to scavenger hunts, an underground guardian organization whose objective is to protect a big secret with their lives...and yes, royal blood too. But sorry Mr Berry, although your story is Brown-ish, the real Brown is better."
3,Decent paced novel,I have read several of Steve Berry's books and this one is a pretty good page turner. It's a well crafted idea inspired from old Russian legends and conspiracy theories. The characters are believeable but I have to say that I thought Miles Lord just didn't get it. He didn't seem to notice the obvious (when it came to his nemesis) although everyone around him did.One thing that Berry does is replay the same scenes using different vantage points. Maybe it is used more frquently than I think but his are the only books I've read that do that. It's an effective technique.Overall the book is a fairly enjoyable ride. A new copy is a good buy but even a better buy would be some of these used copies selling for some spare change.
5,CD is the way to go,"I was surprised to read so much negativity toward this novel. I haven't read the book, but have been listening to the story on CD. I think it's a great audio CD, fast-paced, interesting, catchy, not bogging down, but then again, I like Stephen King on CD and can't stand reading him, so perhaps it's just the format and the abridgement that helps. I've really enjoyed this CD though and would recommend it."
4,A Great Read,"What a great read! If you love adventure, intrigue, and good characters, you will love this book. The historic background and vivid descriptions of Russia provide substance."
1,Once I put it down I could hardly pick it up again..........,"This started out to be a fairly interesting book, but by the time I got halfway thru it, I gave up. I hate to not finish a book, but why waste your time reading something that doesn't hold your attention? This book is just plain dull. Very disappointing. I wish I had waited and checked it out at the library instead of buying it."
4,A good story line on top of a famous historical mystery,"I started with The Amber Room, and then proceeded to the Cotton Malone series. This was Berry's second novel. I expected to see a progression in his writing where it was better than ""Amber Room"" but not as good as the Cotton Malone Series.I was pleasantly surprised to find much better character interaction and dialog than in the Malone series. I felt that the character development was some of Berry's best I've read so far. I thought the characters and their actions were logical and credible. To my mind, this novel corrected some of the weak spots I witnessed in Berry's other books.As always, Berry takes an interesting historical mystery and weaves a good story line on top of it. I really enjoyed this novel."
2,"Interesting, but...","This was a very interesting concept, and Russian history is twisted and fascinating enough to pull this off. Russia wants a return to the old ways, specifically to the tsarist regime, and are conducting inquiries into the closest living male relative to Nicholas II to be their next autocrat. However, concept aside, there were entirely too many coincidences for this to be believable. An example would be how one of the villains agreed that such an action was too expensive to maintain, but - don't worry! - he personally felt the need to reinstate it when their joint venture began.I just didn't buy it, though the hero's actions were often human - he sometimes just didn't know. Good, but again...Fate lent a hand, and everything was fine."
2,Fried? Eggplant~,"As far as I can tell, this eggplant product is not fried at all. I was very disappointed to open up an oily can of mushed-up eggplant. After I diligently poured/swabbed off as much oil as possible, I then warmed up the contents to discover that the aroma and flavor is very appealing and tasty--just not the fried product that the can label depicts. Also, the bottoms of the cans of the case that I received were forming rust spots in many areas. It makes me wonder where this case was stored. Had I realized that the contents were this mushy, I never would have bought a case of it. However, it will make nice addition to my home-style pasta sauces and other tomato-based stews."
3,Just fine,"I gotta buy this book for my class. I have some troubles with the topics inside. I agree that this is a good book but I gotta read from other sources to get more details. The author didn't make clear in many points. However, he covered all of the important topics. If you have some economic background, it would be your wonderful book, but for me it's not."
4,Fascinated with 70's rock and roll,"If you love rock and roll, you will love this CD! It gives you a taste of the 70's rock frenzy but definitely with a 90's twist.It's a great cd to play at your next get together. Try it, you'll like it."
3,Good fun,"The writer, who has obviously worked at creating a breezy, humorous style, has created a fun read. His hero is entertainingly dangerous and the dialogue sparkles. The ending is somewhat of a let down, but I'm going looking for his earlier efforts anyway."
5,THE BEST I'VE USED,"I have used this product for a few years now, and I love it. I have dark circles under my eyes and I've tried everything to cover it up. This is the best so far. It works best if mixed with a little moisturizer and then set with the Covermark clear finishing powder."
5,Don't Let The Title Put You Off,"Hilarious and informative. Good to read on the airplane en route to a developing country, although you may want to scan it beforehand in case there are any supplies you may need to pack. The author's amusing style lends the book a reassuring tone. I felt very much in control after my last trip to SE Asia and used more than a couple of the suggestions offered. Even if you are not a traveler, I would recommend this charming little book."
1,Who would believe this guy?,"Would you believe this guy? He obviously has little insight into sexuality, because even after being caught with a rent boy, he claims to be heterosexual. His level of self-deception is astounding.I'm just guessing here - but lying to yourself is probably not something Jesus would encourage."
4,Your typical movie sound track,"I'ts your typical movie soundtrack, in that it is a mix ofvaroius artists of different styles, with of course the occasionalremix. Many people predicted the soundtrack would contain cheesy eighties hits by bands such as genisis and witney Housten. What in effect happend then was that a decision was made to either make an appropriate soundtrack or qaulity soundtrack.Since the soundtack contains none of the music mentioned in the book, you can assume that the music on the soundtrack was so good that it was worth cancelling music that fit the movie more. And you would be right. The new order track is still as fresh as anything produced today, and the David Bowie is fantastic (this from a non Bowie fan). I onely have to ask the question , why didn't they use Bowies's ""I'm afraid of Americans""?You may have trouble finding this title so you will probably have to buy it here. END"
5,The Best Italian Dictionary!!!!!,"This dictionary is GREAT!!!! It has all kinds of examples as to how you use the words, which helps a lot if you are learning the language. I highly recommend this! I wish the new one had come out sooner... I would have bought that! But this is still a good dictionary! It even has crossword puzzles in it!"
2,"Pointless, Disjointed, But With Interesting Sentences","Geek Love is one of my favorite books ever, but this novel seemed like a Kerouac-style ramble without a plot, compelling characterization, beginning or ending. Underwater misery with no subtlety or explanation."
2,"anti climactic, but has good ideas","I borrowed this book from the library on a whim and, if it wasn't such an easy read, i would have returned it after the first few chapters. It may just have been that my style is different, but if I remove that from my opinion, you still have a book that doesn't deliver many interesting ideas. Without spoiling it, I'll just say that there are a few plots going on at the same time. One is a trite story about an abusive father, one is about a ghost and the last major plot is of a ""mysterious"" storm called the darkness that supposedly always takes a member of the main character's family. The set up is decent enough, but fails to deliver anything thrilling or original. I give the author props for his writing style, but the story itself is dull and painful to get through."
2,Parallel Port connections ...,"The player is great. Just great, especially if you use rechargeable batteries. The parallel port connection is the worst though. I've had the unit for over a year and for the past 4 months I've been unable to upload mp3s to it.Go for a unit with a USB connection instead and save your money."
2,Many problems,"The Cabo MP3 player is NOT what I expected. The company that produces the player (Best Data) has no help or troubleshooting on their sight. I bought a 64 mb memory card for it, and It wouldn't work. This puzzled me, and I looked all over to find the answer. I finally found it. It only supports up to 32 mb memory! This site told me that 64 would work with it. Apparently not. Also, it skips when I listen to recordings. (Not good quality one's either.)The cover for it, isn't very durable. I now have to be careful where the batteries go because a little tab broke off of it. All together, I think that an MP3 player is a good buy, but not this brand."
1,Glitchasaurus,"LED screen: half the characters are faded and unreadableParallel port: puh-leese. I had to reconfigure my CMOS (that was scary) and mess around with basic operating system issues before it would work. Then had to pull CPU out, disconnect printer to use port. What a pain.Software did not work. One of the reasons I spent a lot of time with windows systems settings and looking for online hints was the recurring message that my computer could not find the device when I tried to initialize the internal memory (per the instructions). For grins, I tried to download without this step and low-and-behold the transfer worked. Could have saved myself a couple of hours--ARGH!!!!Bottom line: unpleasant experience."
1,Someone set this player up the bomb!,"I bought one of these little zigs two weeks ago, and strugled with it for like three hours before I could get it to connect wich it only did once the refused to do ever again. Then I found out the headphone jack doesn't work.What you say? Theres no way I'm calling tech support and paying 7 dollars (my dad would kill me) just to have them tell me that ""all my bases belong to them"" when they don't now what their doing. ... I'm firing this zig!As for you, if your reading this, you have a chance to escape - make your time!"
1,Just Plain Stinks,"This was my first MP3 player. Of course I was excited (at first!) It took me about a week to get the thing connected. I had to call in for 7 bucks to talk to someone who told me what to do. sure that worked, the first time. The download was extremely slow and when I wanted to use the printer, I had to go down under and re-connect the cables. The sound is good and so is the MB, but I think Best Data could of worked a little harder to make this thing fun!"
2,Blue Dial Fossil,"Judge me with this watch because the picture was not very good, the chain of the watch makes a lot of noise and is not quality, but the color and the area are great, and apparently came out of inventory and no return, I recommend you see Pulsar's watches, are of better quality."
2,Not a serious drum,"I own a nice Remo djembe and assumed all of their drums were well made. This ocean drum has the decorative ""fabric"" on the back and sides - the fabric is very rough and unpleasant to handle. Additionally, I don't like the sound of the drum. The ""ocean"" effect is not what I expected, either.I bought this for myself, but the drum is going to be given to my niece and nephew (4 and 5 years old). They'll enjoy the pretty fish and banging on the drum with the mallet."
5,Toner Saver saves 20%,"When considering the output of this cartridge, it's important to note that the printers it is used in have a toner saver feature. Using toner saver I have produced quite nice prints and managed to squeeze 20% more out of the cartridge."
1,What is this?,"I don't know if this is a water pump or a wiper blade. The picture is that of a water pump, yet the description says ""wiper blade"". Would you buy this?"
2,Ineffective for me.,"I found this sharpener completely ineffective; perhaps I have the technique wrong, but it didn't work for me or for a couple of more knife-knowledgeable friends I had try it."
1,Strikingly disappointing,"I waited years to see this series, and I couldn't believe how awfully poor the production is. Even for something made in the 70's. Any high-school drama class could do much better. At least they'd think of including subtitles! Couldn't watch more than 20 minutes of the first book. Laughed a little at the ridiculously reddish Robert D'Artois and his unconvincing acting. The worst part of the experience was that neither amazon.com nor the sellers (inetvideo.com) accept returns. Guess the garbage can will have to be it's destiny."
1,"Repetitive, untalented and sloppy.","VNV Nation is a terrible example of the music i love. Their compostition is weak, repetitive and slow. The pentamiter of the lyrics does not match with rythym or bass. The vocals are slow sloppy and untalented. Listening to this vocalist is like listening to the jaw bone of a donkey being scraped along a chalk board in a wide hallway."
4,Good Stuff,Exactly as described. A great item for pocket or purse. The only improvement would be to get the model with the LED light.
2,Not Done Yet,"Dang, this book is S-L-O-W.I have not finished this book, so some may say that I am not 'qualified' to review it, and on some levels I agree.However, let it be known, this book is NOT a page turner!If you have some cash to spare, get the book, if your on a budget, purchase at a later time!"
3,Let's get at least a few facts correct before we lampoon him,"First of all I say kudoos to Justin for having the temerity to stand up to this hegemonist Neo Con cadre trying to impose their dim minded ideals upon the likes of the rest of the thinking denizens of this proud country. Justin Raimondo IS NOT a liberal, and talks proudly of his conservative roots for those above who have decided to do no research on the matter before typing their usual banter.Secondly, anyone who reads the Libertarian platform will see that they are definitely not Anti Americans, Liberals, Conservatives, ect. It is a very open ended viewpoint running the gamut of ideas. It is open, honest, and above and beyond all, very patriotic...probably more so than any other political and idealistic philosophy.Just get at least a few of the facts straight next time guys."
3,poorly annotated,"Where is the evidence to Raimundo's contention that there has been a ""concerted campaign by...supporters of Israel to shape the news [and of] a relentless barrage of baseless accusations [by supporters of Israel]"" referred to on pg. 2? It is possible that Raimundo may be right on in his accusations, but he gives no independent corroboration and thus offers only speculation and innuendo. But, I suppose this is the brave new world of political writing in an Ann Coulter literary universe where anything can be said and nothing need be supported by evidence."
3,Not completely satisfied,"I ordered this (fake) glass of milk for photography & I must say that I'm not completely satisfied with it, especially for the price that I gave!It seems a bit heavier than I antisipated, it doesn't look like the same glass online, it's much more slender. When you turn it to one side it's defected...I suppose air got in while it was being made & it doesn't look real (only on one side though)!All in all...it's very cute & does look realistic! I didn't know that the glass was gonna be REAL glass so I hope it works out for the kids holding it & giving Santa milk/cookies! :)Kim"
1,"Really, really bad!","I found this movie very tedious. I didn't understand this movie at all and it is not because I haven't seen the first one. None of the scenes make any sense. All they did was slap a bunch of crappy action sequences together and didn't even bother to think up a good storyline or at least write a decent script. I kept trying not to fall asleep as I watched this! All of my friends loved this, which makes me really mad. ""People actually fly!"" Oh please! If you want to see people fly, watch Superman. If you want to see a good action movie, watch The Terminator 3."
2,I found tomb raider 2 to be a big disappointment,"I hate the plot - it's poorly executed & doesn't hang together well enough. I also found her butler & geek friend to look too different from the previous movie to actually work - they feel like completely different characters. Overall I also found Lara to be kind of unattractive in this movie (either too chunky or too arrogant looking at all the wrong times).On the upside I do like the relationship between her & her jail gent - it really works, and feels good (even the ending). I also like the realistic & semi-realistic toys (although they do date the movie).Overall though the movie's a big disappointment over the first one, but heck, that's showbiz - can't win 'em all."
4,Good Against Evil!,"No one can deny the appeal that Angelina Jolie has in her role as Lara. She is a beautiful woman who pulls off her character with great strength and grace! Not an easy thing to do.Of course we have our villian, a Scientist who is determined to find the famous ""Pandora's Box"", open it and expel horror upon mankind. Lara takes on the challenge to see this does not happen.This is an action packed movie, a thrill a minute, crammed full of exotic places, breathtaking stunts and even a sprinkle of romance for our heroine! I enjoyed this one! I don't think you will be disappointed!"
4,Cradle of Action,"Once again Lara takes us on an adventure around the globe. This time to find Pandora's Box. The action may not be quite as intense and the supporting cast not as interesting, but it is still an excellent movie.WARNING! this paragraph contains details of the movie. The movie starts with Lara and some Greecian friends exploring Alexander the Greats hidden temple. The bad guys show up and kill her friends and steal the treasure that sheds light on the existence of Pandora's Box. She enlists the aid of an old boy friend that is sprung from jail by MI-5 to help her recover it. This time her nemisis is an entrepreneur that will sell viruses like Eboli to the highest bidder. That is his intent when he gets his hands on Pandora's Box.This movie includes commentary, a documentary, and several other extras. The picture and sound quality are superb. The widescreen edition I got was flawless and it looks exceptional on a large screen high definition TV."
4,"""The Cradle of Life is better than the first Tomb Raider on some aspects.""","Jan de Bont does a better job directing the sequal from the way Simon West did the first movie. The story is better, the performances ( especially Jolie's) are better in this one. We get to know Lara Croft a little more with Gerard Butler's character thrown into the mix. Even Alan Silvestri's score is better than Graeme Revell's from the first movie. The only problem this time is the action, none of the action sequences for the second movie are that interesting, with the exception of the parachute sequence which is pretty neat. If they do a ""Tomb Raider 3"", might I suggest the director for the sequal being (even though he hasn't had the best track record in movies as of recent years) Renny Harlin. He has an eye that would work for this franchise."
2,Boring!,"If you like to look at Angelina Jolie(who is truly stunning) this is the movie for you. If you like to be entertained and don't want to be bored out of your mind, you might want to pass this one."
3,Angelina Jolie = Perfect Lara. Shame about the movie.,"Quite simply Angelina Jolie is perfect as Lara Croft. Her accent, the way she looks and moves are all spot on. I remember telling a friend years ago there was only two actresses who could play Lara, Angelina and Elizabeth Hurley. I'm glad they went with Angelina for 2 reasons, one she is much more athletic than Hurley and two she can actually act.Put simply though even Jolie as Croft cannot save this movie. I found some of the dialogue cheesy beyond belief. The actor who played her partner was completely unbelievable as an ex-Marine ""super soldier."" The action sequences weren't all that.Lets hope for a better 3rd movie with Jolie again playing Lara, but this time with a better story and more impressive action sequences. Get rid of the love interest as well, it really isn't interesting at all. I guess i would like to see the next movie rated 15, have a more adult Lara, more guns, more action, just like the games."
5,Booda's Best Bet,"Although they have to manipulated and one should always use two, the liners and Booda Box make people wonder where the cat box is! Great product."
1,UNWATCHABLE,"From the absolutely horrific acting, to the laughably trite script, everything about this pic is amateurish. Not funny, not scary, not sexy, not interesting. A sub-mental waste of time."
3,Great Price BUT at a Cost to end-user,"I purchased this projector and found it a great deal for the price. There is one major problem however. The engineers at Mitsubishi forget to survey the real life end-users about day to day usage and they ELIMINATED the front height adjustment. While they may have saved a few dollars by doing this, it's back to using ash trays and folded napkins to adjust the image height on a screen. I called Mitsubishi Techical Support about this and quess what??? They agreed it was a bad design! With luck Mitsubishi will come out with some variable-height ash trays in the near future."
5,Great salsa from the masters!!,"Excelente album con un excelente sonido. Fue grabado en vivo en Puerto Rico, en un concierto para celebrar los 30 años de la F.A.S, en 1994. Todas las canciones son muy buenas, en especial ""Quitate la máscara"" con Adalberto Santiago. Tambien ""Bombele"", con Celia Cruz, y ""Mi gente"", en homenaje al fallecido Hector Lavoe. El sonido es buenísimo (en vivo), muy diferente al de Habana Jam, que dejaba mucho que desear. Los arreglos son muy buenos, con esa mezcla de salsa y latin jazz muy característicos de la Fania. Todos los tracks lo ponen a bailar a uno. Buena compra. Ojalá graben mas como éste."
3,tennis,"più pratico del precedente ma sempre poco pratico se lo utilizzi come giocatore, tuttavia, sempre se lo utilizzi come giocatore ti ""permette"" di dare delle pause strategiche al gioco/partita"
3,"Enticing at first, then not.","Cunningham's descriptions of each of the five friends in this book are vivid and real- with each one experiencing the pleasures and pains of life for single women in their 30's. Maybe it's my personal preference, but I found the book a page turner until halfway through, when it became somewhat ho-hum with an anticlimatic ending. Nevertheless, I recommend this book for a quick, light read."
2,Bland Buddy Book,"Friends attempt to make it to a dinner party/baby shower...hostess is rushed, critical snob friend doesn't make it a priority, pregnant friend insecure....blah, blah. The information you get on these gals is not enough to connect you ...but if you had more time with them, you may not find it all that interesting anyway. I love books about female friendships but not this one. This one is just okay. If your reading time is precious, don't bother."
1,You've got to be kidding,"This book, which was recommended in a reputable book review, is one of the biggest wastes of time I've spent in a long while. (I only finished it becayse my book group is reading it.) The characters are caricatures: Not one of them seems remotely believable, and nothing that happens to them rings true. Even the small details are off the mark: A woman from Kentucky pronounces the word kids as ""keeds""? Sorry, but I don't think so."
5,Can't say enough good about it....,Best of all summer reads. Engaging. Moments of laugh out loud funny. Her characters truly take on life of their own. LOVED IT.Highest of all recommendations.
5,Dragon Ball Z at its best,"Listen up ya'll. You want the pure, unsaturated Dragon Ball Z, then the Mangas are your best buy! I have issues 1-7 for DBZ and DB and they are great. Uncensored, uncut, blood, guts, perverted humor, the works! They even use the real names (i.e. Son Goku and Kurirun).See the things America networks didn't want you to see (like the a Ginyu Force member getting his head torn off). Plus one issue is like 10 eps of the TV show. Issue 1 has the entire Raditz saga up to Goku's death Issue two is the snake way and Gohan's training and so on.This series is a must for Dragon Ball fans."
4,Typical SD Card,"nothing special about this purchase, normal 2GB SD card, uhm nice box, exactly what you expect to get from buying a SD card, can't beat the price but watch out for expensive shipping and handling price add-ons."
3,looking for cheap mem card,cheap got here over weekend haven't used yet will use in a car radio adaption smaller seems to be more costly per gigabyte
3,I never used it,The item was recommended by amazon for purchase with another item. So i purchased it and it didn't even fit that item. I gave it away. No problems reported by the person I gave it to.
1,SanDisk 2GB SD Memory Card 2 GB,We purchased two this item. Each cost $11.58. The cost for USPS shipping was outrageous!! The item weighed 1oz and we were charged $12.98. Even with handling charges the total probably should have been $5.41 (.41 for 1 oz w/USPS). Needless to say we will NOT be doing business with this company again.
1,"If you are going to buy it, do not get it from ChiTek!!!!","I am 100% sure that this product is excellent, but please do not buy it from ChiTek. You will be better of buying it from another seller. There are many sellers on Amazon selling this same product and even at cheaper prices. I had a very bad experience with this seller, they mess up with my order, charge me for it and I never received the item because they wrote a wrong address on the item box, when they obtained my address from Amazon records??? And after they realiced they made a mistake they cancelled my order and did not enven told me about it. Just don't buy it from ChiTek."
3,memory card,It was okay - it does not seem to be clear in the camera - have not printed any pictures from this memory card yet
3,Excessive Shipping,"I received this product in a very timely manner, in good shape. BUT the shipping was aweful! Mine was just like another persons, came in a small little package with 1, yes 1 piece of packing peanuts. Like that would help and the postage said $.58! Still cheaper than going to the store, but they are a rip off for the shipping."
3,ScanDisk,"Memory is memory, I'm not sure if it's my adapter that's on the fritz or if its the disk thats giving me trouble, but the only way I can get the info off of the disk is plugging my camera into the computer, other then that, works like a charm"
3,Good product,I'm a writer who has suffered through one too many computer crashes. I keep this card in my SD reader and save all work to it. I have other backups but this is easily transportable to another computer. This prices is a good value. I paid much more at the office supply stores.
5,great product,"I am using this with my FM transmitter in my car. I have sound tracks that I have purchased and saved on this card and plug it into the FM transmitter in my car, Very easy to use. Nothing else to say"
5,memory card,"I recently got this card a month or two ago for my EASYSHARE V803 Zoom Digital Camera and it works great! For 8 mgp camera, it can store over 800 pictures!"
4,works fine,This works fine. Not much to add. It was a decent bargain and has been fine since purchase.
5,Huge Storage and Savings,Good value for money. I clicked around 200 pics and i still have 1.4 GB free space. Worth the money spent.
1,Check out the shipping price!,"I placed an order for 3 of these SD cards, thinking they were are great deal at about $4 each. When I saw the shipping charge, though, I reconsidered. The SD cards came to $12.03, but shipping & handling was $18.97! Actual mailing costs has to be under $2 for these things, so the seller is luring people in with a low product cost and making a killing on the shipping."
5,Spectacular,"Es un libro espectacular y excelente, muy bueno, claro, explicativo y bellas fotos. Lo recomiendo a todas las personas que deseen aprender como decorar exoticos y majestuosos pasteles, tortas o biscochos.It is spectacular and excellent book, descriptive and with beautiful pictures. I recommend it for all people that want to learn how to decorate exotic and majestic cakes."
1,NICE COLOR,"NICE COLOR BUT, IS NO GOOD BOOK JUST BEAUTIFUL PICTURE,I' M SORRY REALLY NICE DECORATION BUT NO EXPLAIN HOW WE CAN MADE IS NO NICE"
5,ENJOYED THIS MOVIE.,"I watched ""Cobra"" this weekend (had viewed segments of it on YouTube previously).Loved the sets and the ladies outfits....Valentino's wife, Natacha Rambova, might have had no money-sense but she most assuredly could design.Loved the story and the acting. I particularly enjoyed the night club setting and Valentino's response to the little note the waiter brought.My son, having pulled up a site on the internet about the movie, noted that Rambova had a small part as a dancer in the film. But I could not find her. I know (having viewed a photograph in Hill's ""Silent Idol"" of Valentino talking to the girl who was the Cobra dancer) so where was Rambova?If you are a Valentino fan, this movie is a must have."
3,"Good Writing, Poor Story Line",I like Suzanne Matson's style of writing...but i thought that the story line left something to be desired. I do hope she writes more though. If you are considering buying this book...I think its worth it...it's pretty touching...But it wont be one of your all time favorites.
1,"Trite story, cliche characters","This book was recommmended by a book store employee, so I was expecting a good read. The story was not well developed (even flawed), and while not predictable, it was rather trite. Cliche characters -- a bulemic dancer, an aging independent woman and a single mom obsessed with her baby -- come together, but don't seem to get very far."
4,I wished this book was longer.,I read this book in one day because I couldn't put it down. I wanted to know more. I thought the author wrapped up the book too quickly in the end. I enjoyed the way she entwined the three women through life circumstance.
4,Women learning to befriend one another: Easy reading.,"While The Hunger Moon does not compete with the striking characters of Where the Heart Is or Ellen Foster, Matson presents realistic characters who reach outside their comfort zone and find reward in it. Not verbose, the reader does not have to wade through pages of picuayne details as in In Dark Water or Jewel. A good stress-breaker."
3,Not all have adjustable inner liners...,"I bought these for my 2 year old's birthday. We have other helmets but they don't stay put on his head...they are all too large. So the fact that these helmets were advertised as ""having adjustable plastic liners for a perfect fit"" were a big selling point. Unfortunately it was a false statement. Only the construction and fire hats are adjustable inside. The other two helmets have very inflexible and uncomfortable chin straps.The bottom line is that my son likes playing with them but I am disappointed."
5,a legendary album,"Kris Kristofferson's ""Kristofferson"" is one of the most original and underrated albums of his generation. While his contemporaries were rehashing the same material and ides over and over, Kristofferson offered something new to Nashville. What makes this album so great is how Kristofferson tells the bitter truth. His songs are about drunks and despair and straying away from one's path. Instead of being depressing however, it is uplifting and can be cathartic to people who have been through similar experiences as Kristofferson did. The music is top notch and a great mixture of different genres. The highlights on the album are: ""To Beat The Devil,"" ""Me And Bobby McGee,"" ""Help Me Make It Through The Night,"" ""Just The Other Side Of Nowhere,"" and of course ""Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down."" A must have for anyone who likes good and sincere music. I can't even begin to explain how much this album means to me."
5,Never before have two morons been so inspirational.,"I loved ""Anvil: The Story of Anvil"". If you rent or buy one DVD this month make it this one. I remember Anvil's song ""Metal on Metal"" from back in the day. Little did I know they're still around. They've been at it for 30 years--still trying to make it as rock stars. The movie is like ""Spinal Tap"" meets ""The Wrestler"" meets ""Some Kind of Monster"". Never before have two morons been so inspirational. My wife loved it too even though she didn't like the music. Turn it up to 11."
3,Enjoyable,"Despite being a sort of poorer version of Spinal Tap (which I would rate at 4*s), this d(m)ocumentary held my interest for 80 minutes.It's difficult to tell how much was real, and what was put on for the camera. Having seen Anvil play Reading in 1981(or was that 2?), I know something of their background (from Toronto), play crappy heavy metal (oops, did I say that out loud).Then saw them last weekend and they haven't changed a bit (well maybe the bassist has). Music still as bad.This was a band destined to go nowhere .. and they would have succeeded, but for this film.If you liked Spinal Tap, you won't be bored by this, only this band is for real (for the most part)."
1,You've Got to be Kidding,"Is this supposed to be a joke? Is this supposed to be the new Spinal Tap? If this is a joke -- I don't get it. Everyone likes to root for an ""underdog"", but the underdog has to at least have a little bit of talent and a genuine reason why they should succeed. Why has Anvil struggled for 25 years trying to make it? Because they aren't any good. Their playing is mediocre at best and their songs are lame and amateurish. There are a thousand highschool garage bands who are just as good as these guys.At least Spinal Tap's songs were clever and well done."
3,ANVIL; THE STORY OF ANVIL,LIKED A FEW SONGS SO I DECIDED TO GET THIS CD. AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS CD COVERS IT ALL. LIKE I SAID NOT A BIG FAN JUST LIKED SOME SONGS. SO IF NOT A BIG FAN IT'S WORTH BUYING USED THRU AMAZON.
5,the band can play!!,"and the story is lovely. the whole thing, one of the best documentaries ive ever seen.. if you like metal, of any kind , youll like this movie. very few movies show people being so honest."
1,It's the worst,I just can't get the idea for a children's book that a wolf eats pigs. And it made my little brother very afraid of wolfs. He even tried to build a brick house out of mud and rocks.
5,Saved Me Money on College Textbooks,"This book arrived in excellent condition, with limited highlighting. I got it much cheaper than the price our college bookstore was selling it for."
4,A bear named trouble,All little boys love adventure and my grandson loved this story. He was born in Alaska and it was a nice way for him to see a story set in a place he knew.Wonderful pictures for him to look at too!
5,a timeless classic,"I love all of the music on this disc, but ""Thanksgiving"" is, in my opinion, one of the most breathtakingly beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard."
1,Good Music Bad CD,"This is a great CD. However, the copy that I bought from Amazon -- along with the CD Forest would not play properly. I have never had this problem before but it would make me think twice about buying a CD, especially as a gift, from Amazon. Since I already own copies of these albums, I thought my gift was a sure thing. What a disapointment!"
5,you are absolutely the best of all time,Please come back to Stetson University (your favorite place to play) and play for us again. We missed you last year and dearly want you to play for us again. We hear the acoustics are perfect in Elizabeth Hall!!
5,Magnifico,"A wonderful experience, listening to the hypnotic seductive voice of Enrique. Meaningful lyrics that invite you to try and get inside his mind. He puts so much emotion and passion into his songs which makes you feel as if you are living an experience with him. My favourite song is probably Addicted (they are all too good to put into words that give Enrique the credit he deserves). This is mainly due to having seen him singing it on CD Uk and Graham Norton. Also the additional experience of seeing the video. It makes me feel like reaching out to him through the window. I want more!!Welcome back Enrique!!!"
5,IM IN LOVE WITH THIS 7 CD,"HI MY NAME IS LUZ.I HAVE ALREADY MY 7 , I LOVE IT, I PLAYED LOTS OF TIMES, YEP, I LOVE TO DANCE WITH IM NOT IN LOVE, IM ADICTED TO ENRIQUE MUSIC, AND BE YOURSELF IS MORE TO ENCOURAGEMENT FOR ME TO BE MY TRUE SELF.ALSO ALL THE CD IS SO GOOD, SO I PLAY 7 DAYS A WEEK MY CD. IM IN LOVE WITH ENRIQUE MUSIC.THANK YOU GUYS AND ENRIQUE.LOVE LUZ."
5,5+ Stars All the Way,This is the best Enrique CD yet! You will not be disappointed! Great variety of classic Enrique with an up beat twist.
2,Predictable pop,"I must say that Enrique is going a bit downhill lately. At first he was the great latino star with hits like ""Bailamos"" ""Rhythm Devine"" and ""Be With You"" all were a kind of trademark for his style, but the longer he's been singing the less of those songs we hear. This album is just blatant ordinary pop, it could have been sang by anyone. Well it works, he continue to sell albums and he'll score a few hits most likely but it's neither very good or entertaining. Let's just compare ""Addicted"" to ""Hero"" if that's possible. It's miles away from his last Cd's hitsingle. I Think ""The Way you touch me"" is one of the best here, also ""You Rock me"" should get mentioned. This album is not exactly a bad record, but it's far from what he can and should archive."
3,Description questionable,"Rated 'average' because I don't know what I got. I bought this to be used out of doors to secure a gate.The ""Technical Details"" include:""All brass internal mechanisms for strength and durability""Which would be good to stop it from rusting up.But the product packaging says(see image above):Body MaterialX ZINC diecastI have it out on the fence and it will probably take 2 years of weather to see if it locks up (no pun intended) due to oxidation. I would think that brass internals would be something touted in the products packaging."
1,REALLY STUPID,"This is just nauseating stuff folks. If your idea of watching 'erotic horror' involves grotesque fat feminist Amy Lynn Worst (aka Amy Lynn Best) rolling around in Karo syrup then have at it. Yes, this is her latest insult / exploitation of horror fans - created simply because she isn't attractive enough to be the lead in a proper horror movie (she also nurtures a deep hatred of horror fans over this fact which has slipped out in her interviews). Well known as a charlatan who brown-noses magazine editors and distributors in the underground horror industry (along with her 'director' husband Mike Watt) the woman actually loathes horror fans for being so 'misogynistic' yet turns around and hypocritically releases this! Desperate to exploit horror fans at all costs, here we find her AGAIN trying to rip people off with this ridiculous video that continues to mock the intelligence of genre fans. Don't waste your money on this pathetic charlatan who loathes the fans she markets to."
1,A word of Warning,I recently purchased a phone which called for a MicroSD chip. I purchased the bargain brand thinking that one would be as good as another. Come to find out this perticular brand tends to be between 1-2 mm thin to register in an array of devices. If your instruction manual reccomends a certain brand I discovered the hard way you probably want to follow their advice. I paid a little more and traded brands and every thing worked fine. I easily found tech support discussion boards and blogs questioning this brand's capabilities.
4,snugfit,They are ok but a little expensive considering you have to cut them yourself. But like them better than the seabond cushions !!
5,Off the charts awesome!!,This is probably one of my all-time favorite kung-fu movies.It is the classic revenge story (set in the west?) with theincredible talents of Billy Chong and Carl Scott. This movie also featuresnutzo NY Karate legend Louis Neglia...Great acting and training sequences. Phenomal fighting!Why haven't you ordered this yet?
2,CD skips,"The first CD arrived with a skip on the very number I bought the disc for. A second CD was sent and it also skips on the same song. I was willing to work it out with the seller but can't figure out how to contact him. I'd just like to get one that doesn't skip, or at least let them know what is happening. (I don't want to go through the return/exchange process again.)"
3,5 and 2 Stars - GREAT tool ... no keepsake tin,"GREAT tool (5 Stars) ... but does not include ""Individually boxed in keepsake tin with a silver lid"" (2 stars) ...I owned one of the Victorinox SwissTools several years go and I LOVED it. I'm happy to say that I like my new one even better (the RS model has a cross section of individual tools that I prefer to the ones in my older model). The belt pouch is well designed and handsom and the quality with which everything is made is simply top notch. I've never seen a tool of this kind that I liked better and I can HIGHLY recommend it.However ... as advertised, this model is said to come with a tin gift box ... and it simply doesn't."
4,Great multitool,"This is a very good tool if you are camping, hiking or just to get stuff done.I would recommended this to any one who likes to do those things(like my self),the only problem is that the metal part witch keeps the tools is to big and uncomfortable on your hands. But over all I love this multitool and it is like a dog, a man`s best friend."
2,Works but fragile,"With only lightest use, managed to lose 3 of the ear cushions in less than 3 wks. Plus the bracket no longer holds the earboom on the winder.Now I can hear but no one on the other end can. Plus it falls out of my ear. I know the the cushions are cheap and replaceable but I'd need to buy 10 packs...Would love to find one that would stand up to daily use."
1,"Ineffective, uncomfortable, a waste of money","There's not much to say about this item except that I'm embarrassed and regretful that I didn't send it back during the 30-day return period.Here's why it's awful:1) It's a pain to actually GET on your ear!Unlike the wonderful in-ear jabra gel thing I use with my cordless phone at home, this takes at least 20-30 seconds to get on my ear each and every time. Not the sort of thing you want to be doing while driving, which sort of defeats the purpose now, doesn't it?2) It's uncomfortable when it's against your ear.Rough plastic. 'nuff said.3) The sound quality -- at least on my end -- is lousy.When there's even a moderate amount of ambient noise, I have a lot of trouble hearing the other party, though they can hear me just fine.Definitely a bummer of an item, and quite a disappointment after my earlier happy experience with Jabra!"
4,Micheal Cain as the anti-Bond....,"Micheal is the crook who gets the lucky break from prison to work for British Intelligence. Unlike Bond, however they don't even give him a gun. All that's between him and those dodgy East German Agents is his quick wit, East London nonce and his love of cooking...."" I'm going to cook you...the best meal...you've ever had"" and if that doesn't get the ladies to bed, I don't Know what does."
5,Magnificent!,"Compelling, entertaining, historical... this book is a real page-turner.Muller's keenly-observed journey skillfully interweaves past and present, giving the reader a glimpse of what life must have been like in the golden heyday of the Inca empire as she walks along stones and walkways trodden by warriors and peasants for hundreds of years. She writes with compassion and genuine understanding of those she meets along the way - peopling her book with characters who come to life and leap off the page. Along the Inca Road transports the reader into a world most of us will never see - probably for the best, since the road is long and arduous. I'm glad I didn't have to do it - but I'm even more glad that she did!"
5,Great story,Caddie Woodlawn is one of the best books a girl can read. It is like the little house books only better. I love this bok and recamed it to anyone.
5,A wonderful book for all ages,"I liked this book alot because it was a whole different view from pioneer life. I got tired of cooking and sewing because that got boring to me. Caddie Woodlawn did things that other girls did not even dream about doing, and that is good! I liked the story and I reccomend it for all ages, no matter what the ages on your book say. It is a wonderful book and I hope you will read it."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,I GAVE THIS A FIVE STAR BECAUSE WHEN MY MOM READ IT TO ME AND MY SISTER WE LOVED IT SO MUCH THAT WHEN MY MOM STOPPED READING ME AND MY SISTER BEGGED HER TO READ MORE. SHE ONLY GAVE IN ONCE. Caddie Woodlawn was a girl who lived in Wisconsin during the Civil War. My favorite scene was when Indians attacked. I highly recommend it.
4,Excellent for Beginners,This book has very well written instructions to learn in-line skating from the beginning. It has been very useful for me to get some background before heading to a formal skating course. It is nice that the book also contains advice on equipment and related magazines.I think it should have further figures because many drills are difficult to understand by only a written description.
1,Not a qualitative product,"For a long time searched for this album.But when has received a disk, it was found out that there it is written down four tracks, instead of seventeen.And taking into account delivery to Russia it has turned out not cheaply."
4,Excellent,Bought as a gift for my wife but my daughter has claimed it so I will need to buy another one - also I need a wide margin of the same but dose not seem to be a printed item>BlessingsTrevor d
1,I didn't get what i payed for!,"I didn't get what I payed for! The screen said large print bible and I recived a bible with regular print! It was for my moms birthday, it was a good thing she wasn't to dissapointed."
2,i let my husband read it first,"usually when an anne rice novel comes in to this house a fight breaks out. this fight is so predictable that in the past i have purchased two copies, of her latest work, one for him one for me. something told me this would not be necessary this trip out.. i read 30 pages, left it lying about, he read 50 pages , while on the treadmill and the book has been sitting on the night stand, untouched for a week.. last night he asked me if i could recommend something good to read. anne, thanks for saving me from another marital argument."
2,Good Bargain,"I bought this book at a garage sale. It's a good book to read before bedtime during our winter season up here. I had a hard time following the details and found myself skimming past numerous pages just to get to any sort of plot. I love the character Stefan; I think because of his Russian aristocrat background; something different and more haunting. However, the character, Triana, because she was depicted as being an over weight, whoa is me Ugly Duckling, I had a hard time enjoying (or believing) the script with the tender & passionate kissing from Stefan during the part when he was trying to get his violin back. I would get a mental image of Triana and her character description. Just killed it. I felt more sorry for Stefan then I did for Triana."
1,"I couldn't make it past 30 pages, and I'm a big Rice fan.","At the risk of simply repeating the reviews of others, Ann Rice has greatly disappointed this once loyal fan. Although her quality has at times been uneven, I've always spent many a late night finishing her books. This time, I just couldn't get past the first few chapters. The more I read, the worse it got. I became so bored and disinterested that I could no longer even keep the characters straight. I'm going to forget that Ann ever wrote this book, and I'll instead look forward to her next work...but next time, I'll play it safe and wait for the paperback version."
1,A waste of trees,"The vampire Lestat was her last good book. Since then, she's slid farther and farther down hill and ""Violin"" is just awful. I couldn't finish it."
1,Yeesh.,"This book was appalling--ridiculously dramatic with a meandering writing style that is mind-numbing. I found myself flipping ahead in the hopes of some type of plot formation, but alas, no such satisfaction. It took me three tries to get past the first few pages--and after that every page was irritatingly convuluted and meaningless. Awful. Save yourself the trouble."
2,Boring and oppressive,"All I can say is that, compared to ""The Witching Hour"" which I couldn't put down and was sorry it ended, the ""Violin"", on the other hand, is one that I can't wait to finish so that I can read something else.... I keep waiting for it to get better!"
1,Disappointing,I am a great fan of Anne Rice but this book is one of the worst books I've ever read. I simply hated the main character Triana and only kept on reading just to see if the ghost finally gets his violin back. Maybe a short story would have been a better idea and not a complete novel of 372 pages.
1,I did not like this book at all.,"I was supremely excited to last week to find that Anne Rice's newest novel, Violin, was at my local public library. I checked it out and took it home. I sat down in my favorite chair to begin reading it as I had done with all of the other Anne Rice books that I had read and loved. But as I began with the Proem, something seemed wrong to me. I think I read about 20 pages before I was thoroughly disgusted with its lack of action and complete abstraction. I could make no sense of the latest work by one of my favorite authors. The book sat around for about a week before I returned it today, unread."
1,Grim and Silly story.,"It is hard to believe that someone who has written so many great and interesting stories can also write this book. It was a chore to get through it and although I read 80% of it, I realized I did not need to dread going back to it. I could just put it down unfinished, which I did. This book is a vast betrayal to the many Anne Rice fans. Please, Anne don't do this again!!!"
