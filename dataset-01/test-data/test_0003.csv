3,smaller than swaddlers,"order the same size from amazon, but this one is a little bit smaller than swaddlers. Swaddlers is softer than this one, too."
1,lumps in the diapers,"i don't know if it's pampers or this particular distributor, but there are what seems to be dried up resins in lumps in the diapers. i wonder if they absorbed moisture then dried. i'll never buy another pampers diaper."
3,Love pampers,"I do love pampers diapers. I was a little disappointed in the baby dry vs the swaddlers. The swaddlers are definitely softer and just fit my babies better. I wish the swaddlers went up in the next size. I will say that these baby dry do work well but they are a tiny bit smaller than the swaddlers in the back. I had a hard time finishing the box b/c of them being smaller. I purchased the next size up the next time and they fit great. I am use to them now and like them. If I had a choice over these and the swaddlers, I would def pick the swaddlers for the softness."
2,contents leaking,I got the replacement because of severe diaper rash which is the first time for my son. I have to say amazon customer is good. They send me new box and I send old ones back.But the new box is even worse. There s Crystal like stuff come out from the diaper. I need wash my son every time.
3,Not very satisfied with Pampers Baby dry size 1 diapers,"I used pampers baby dry size 1 for my 2 months old and I'm not very satisfied with them.They soak the pee ok but you can feel the wetness from outside and they are really badwhen my little on poops,they cannot stand it and it all comes out and she needs a completechange everytime she poops.I really didn't like these much.Pampers swaddlers dry max are byfar the best ones I used."
2,You get what you pay for . . .,"Rather flimsy construction, prone to leaks, with a distinct chemical smell when baby is wet--I wouldn't buy these diapers again."
1,Unacceptable,"We started out with Pampers Swaddlers from newborn to Size 2-3 which is the largest that they make. These were hands down the best diapers we have tried during the first year. After our daughter outgrew the Swaddlers we tried Pampers Cruisers and were a little disappointed, however the Cruisers did their job of keeping everything where it was supposed to be. I saw the reviews for Baby Dry and thought ""hey let's try these and see if they are better than Cruisers"" BIG MISTAKE. We received the diapers yesterday and have already had multiple leaks and overflows. These diapers have almost no absorbency and need to be changed approximately every 2 hours for us. We made the mistake of using it overnight and the entire bed was soaking wet this morning.These diapers may work for some, however I can't believe that they would work for many considering how little they can hold. Buyer beware."
5,Pampers Economy Pack Plus,When my Grandbaby is happy. I'm happy. I've always liked Pampers for many years with my kids and now I'm using them for my Grandbabies. The Pampers Economy Pack Plus is really nice. Why? Because it keeps me from running back to the store which save me gas money and it's also saves me money going with the Economy Pack Plus. Thank you Pampers for being there when we need you. =)
4,Ok For the money,They are good for the money however you can get more for the same price at walmart. I think I will be going with that option from now on.
3,Too thick,"seemed like everytime we went and tried to pull out a wipe, we ended up getting two or three. Honestly the wipes just seemed thicker than what we would need."
2,Not that great,"I wasn't too impressed by these diapers. The diaper itself stays dry overnight and doesn't leak through if the baby just pees. However, these diapers (size 2) seem low on my 14 lb baby (he is on the longer side though) and he had several leaks (pooped out the back and front at the same time on several occasions), honestly, I wondered if I should have gotten a size 3 for him. The size 2 pampers swaddlers are great and the pampers baby dry just don't compare."
1,Watch out---New Design EXPLODES!,"Ever since they've redesigned these, almost every morning, my son is found wet, and the diaper has actually split on the sides with the gel contents spilling everywhere. It's ever so much fun having to clean a toddler, crib, walls, floor, all first thing in the morning. I have used these religiously since the first couple of months, but I've changed brands."
5,excellent,"Amazon is the best place to shop. The price is reasonable and because of the count, it last long. Overall, it is a good buy."
2,Cheaply made.,This is the very cheap product that does not measure up to the standards of the other Pampers diapers. I would recommend not to buy this but the 186 count instead.
2,don't like the quality,"I won't use it again.very low quality. I feel the frequency with which I change these ,adds up the cost.so better to buy a good quality diaper."
2,Leaks all the time,"My bundle of joy is 4.5 mo old and none of the other diapers leaked until I started using this one. I tried other brands, Huggies, Luv and also Pampers Swaddlers and they all work fine except this one."
1,Worst costumer service ever!!!!!!!! size runs small,"My baby isn't 17lbs yet and these diapers were too small for her, and they say it is for 16 to 28 lbs. Plus, even though my baby sleeps through the night , when I used this diaper, she woke up at 2:30am all WEAT. I called the Pampers costumer service and they offered me a $5 coupom...........yes, I could not believe it, at last they offered a $10 coupom, so I'll still need to spend monwy on it? I hopped to have at least a size 4 sent to me. Be carefull, those diapers can work for you, but be concious that whenever you need the costumer service they will not replace the diapers.Not buying Pampers agin........by the way, seventh generation and Huggies are far better!Viviane"
1,Try another diaper!,These diapers have been a huge disappointment! They claim to be Baby Dry but they don't keep anything dry. We've only been using them for a few days and every day we've had to change outfits because of wet diapers. The diaper doesn't even seem to absorb anything. As far as night protection? There's no way it offers 12 hours of protection. Maybe one or two and that's if you're willing to change the sheets.I'm going back to Luvs.
3,Great diaper except for the stains,"We have used Pampers Baby Dry since our daughter was 3 months old. We love this diaper, it keeps our daughter dry throughout the night and doesn't cause any skin irritations. However, since January, every box we have purchased has contained numerous diapers with redish brown stains on them. I'm not sure what the stain is, the company isn't sure but thinks it might just be oil/grease and will look into the problem. Considering it is now May I would think the problem would have been solved by now yet the most recent box we received had several stained diapers. I don't feel comfortable putting stained diapers on my child and therefore, as much as we love Pampers Baby Dry we will possibly have to switch diapers. Diapers are just too expensive to have to toss several due to stains. I expect better from Pampers and I'm disappointed."
5,Pampers Baby Dry - Size 4.,"I've been ordering this pampers size 4 now for about a year. Subscribe and save.Very Good Deal, Item exactly as expected!"
3,"Great product, SLOW shipping!",I held off on buying diapers in the store because I had a coupon for diapers here. The coupon was supposed to have them here in 2 days (from when it shipped out) and it took over a week. Let's just say that I had to improvise while we waited. I'll be going back to the old fashioned method of buying diapers in the store from here on out.
4,Good product... but no more subscribe and save!,"I love these diapers. They work well with my daughter. No leaks here! But I used to buy them on the Subscribe and Save program, and that's no longer available. Now the price at Amazon is just as high as anywhere else. I am upset that it's not a good deal anymore."
5,Great Deal,"This was such an amazing deal! Pampers diapers for below off-brand prices. The box, even though from the warehouse, was in excellent condition and there was no indication that it had ever been opened. Couldn't be happier."
2,A defective pack,"This is the first time I ordered size 5. It was a defective pack. The sides stick to the inside of the diaper when I try to open up the diaper to put it on my child. When I forcibly pull them apart, plastic is left on the area my daughters bum will be, as well as strands of plastic left hanging that I have to be careful to pick off so my child doesn't get them. Hopefully it is just this pack. It still absorbs as Pampers usually do."
5,Pampers dry max,"My 18 months old daughter is prone to diaper rashes. Anything that's a little hard rubs against her sensitive skin and she gets rashes which look like pimples and red, in a few seconds. I tried all the brands- huggies baby dry, luvs, rite-aid brand, Walgreens brand but only pampers dry max worked for her. It absorbs a lot n she is always dry, unless left overnight( more than 8 hrs). Huggies little movers are also good, but none can beat pampers and as for the price with amazon subscribe and save, pampers is cheaper and delivery is fast. I highly recommend this product for babies with sensitive skin."
1,DO NOT BUY if your child has sensitive skin!,"If your child has sensitive skin DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND. Our child suffered for 3 months with total body rash - we thought it was due to food allergies, but it was actually due to the diaper. Pampers use TOO MUCH DYE on the images on the diapers. The dye is totally unnecessary. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, even more so, DON""T SUBJECT YOUR BABY TO unnecessary CHEMICALS and ALLERGENS.TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!!"
2,I'm switching back to Swaddlers,"I figured for the price I'd give pampers dry a chance and now I'm incredibly disappointed with this product. I'm not exactly why it's called ""Pampers Dry"" since it does a horrible job at absorbing urine. On many occasions I'd have to change my baby's clothes simply because the urine has run up her back and wet her clothes along with my bedsheets.I'm going back to Swaddlers!"
1,go somewhere else,"You can buy these cheaper at the babiesareus store (with mail/email coupons) Product itself is good, I am a pampers brand mom."
3,increible price,"These diapers smell kinda plastic!!! But besides that the diapers function very, very well and has an incredible price. This is great since I just had triplets. Economy pack highly recommended for those with many kids!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Bad Diapers,"We have been using Pampers Cruisers, I got these by mistake. These are not anywhere near as good as the Cruisers."
4,Like the price & quantity,I bought these diapers mainly because of the price and the quantity. I like them but found they leak often. I prefer Luvs.
2,Not as good as Cruisers,"I normally buy Pampers Cruisers, I will not buy these again. They seem really cheap, plastic like, I don't like the smell. Yuck, can't wait for the jumbo pack to be done!"
4,Minimal graphics,"Of course these are absorbant and highly functional--the industry has that figured out. Of the mainstream affordable disposible diapers, these have the least noticable and annoying graphics. The other kind of Pampers are the worst--covered in purple."
4,Best Daytime Diapers We've Found,"I really like these diapers. They are great at preventing daytime leaks. I would give them five stars, but they don't work well at night. We use Pampers Extra Protection at night instead."
3,Its ok,"Nothing special to report here, was looking for an overnight diaper for my 21 month old, it does an adequate job, only one or two leaks out of the diaper, but that may have been because it was loose or she was in a position where it was apt to leak. Not bad, not the best, but works well enough, maybe there are other brands out there that perform as well for less dollars."
4,Pampers Size 4 Economy Pack,I ordered the Economy Pack of Pampers Baby Dry Size 4 and I LOVE Pampers although the size is a little small for 4 it was very convenient and nice sized!! I will order this product again!!!
1,Not my favorite,We used Pampers sensitive swaddlers for my son but by the time he was size 3 they did not work. The swaddlers didn't have good protection and he would poop out of them. We decided to try baby dry. They are awful every diaper he either pees or poops out of. Now I am constantly washing his clothes and going through at least 3 outfits a day. I am really not happy with Baby Dry. I loved Pampers but a friend of mine told me she had same problem with the larger sizes of Pampers and had to switch to huggies. :(
3,"They work, but not my favorite diaper","I ordered these diapers because there were no more Luvs in size 5 available for my subscribe and save. I have usually liked Pampers in the past, but I was not impressed with these. For a size 5 they were considerably smaller than other brands in a size 5. They have not leaked so far, but they are not comfortable for my son at all and for the price, they should be. I am on baby number four and I do know that different diapers work differently for each person/child, but I am not impressed with these."
1,Horrible,"If we don't change the diaper at least every 3 hours, there is a spill. So every morning when our daughter wakes up we have to wash everything in her bed. The jell in the diapers gets saturated so easily. Some of the jell has actually leaked out and given our daughter a break out on her tummy and legs. Not to mention everything else she has leaked on. The swadlers were the best. I should have just sticked with them."
2,Leaky diapers,When my baby did #2 they always leaked. I switched to pampers swaddlers and they are perfect. I ordered these by mistake to begin with.
5,our favorite diapers,"These are the least bulky, most silky feeling of all the diapers we've tried (and we've tried them all.) My daughter LOVES Elmo and the Sesame Street characters on them, and they are as leakproof as any other brand."
5,Best Diapers EVER!!!!,"In the year we have been using these, my son has never once soaked through. Not even over night. That speaks VOLUMES in this house!!!"
5,Great value! The quality product for the price I wanted!,I purchased these for my sister in law's baby shower and they were a big hit! I made these adorable diapers into a 4 layer diaper cake and had plenty more to spare. I trust the pamper brand name and so I was glad that I was able to give her a functional and yet presentable gift. My family has always bought Pampers and I'm glad we can continue this tradition with the next bundle of joy.
1,Poor quality - new design?,"I am a long-time Pampers buyer and have never had a complaint before, but my latest batch of baby dry must be either defective or a new design. The tabs tear off of the diaper with the tiniest amount of force. Which means as I'm diapering my wiggly baby, I sometimes go through three diapers before I get one on that stays intact. Very frustrating for such an expensive product. Never had this experience with this brand with my older children, so have to assume Pampers is cutting corners."
1,Terrible diaper,I got these diapers because I had a coupon. Big mistake. It felt like it took forever for me to get through this one pack of diapers. I almost threw them out completely. They have hardly ANY tabs on the size so they are too tight on my little one. They are also pretty scratchy and not at all soft.I think the best diapers on the market are the swaddlers made by the same company.
2,Diapers ok...delivery: HORRIBLE,"Diapers are Pampers, so they work as well as any diaper. Except, that I prefer Safeway brand diapers because they hold overnight and are slightly bigger than Pampers. But, the price is comparable to Amazon.com. Delivery, on the other hand was horrible! Box was totally ripped, torn and almost all the diapers were exposed. Deivery by UPS and I took a pic. Very disappointed Amazon didn't put box into another to protect the cheap box the diapers are orginiall packaged in."
2,Exploding diapers,At your peril let your child fill one of these diapers eg during a long overnight sleep or nap... The diapers literally explode and you will find bits of soaked absorbent material all over the place. These are not as absorbent as other leading brands and when they are wet they also feel wet on the outside. I expected so much more from pampers
2,Won't order these again.,We prefer the Swaddlers! Much more roomy - big difference between these and the Swaddlers. We won't order these again!
4,feels squishy with the slightest bit of wetness,"I don't remember the Baby Dry being like this before, but they feel like that dry max stuff. It feels like she's soaking wet and squishy after the tiniest bit of urine hits the diaper. I much prefer the other high cost brand that doesn't cost as much!"
1,PAMPERS BABY DRY ARE TERRIBLE!!!,"Don't buy these!!! I have always used Pampers diapers, and think they are far superior to other brands. Until, that is, I tried these Baby Dry diapers! They leaked like crazy! Not onece or twice, but every time I used them! If I didn't change the baby IMMEDIATELY after them getting wet, it would soak straight through the diaper and wet her clothes! NEVER had a problem like that with the Cruisers...I still have an almost full package of Baby Dry because I got sick of changing clothes constantly from the leaks! I will never buy these again-- only Pampers Cruisers from now on!!!"
1,NOT GOOD,I was shocked at how poor these diapers were for a name brand. My 2 year old would constantly pee through these after being in one for only an hour! The Target diapers and the Huggies work much better for my son.
2,DO NOT last the night,"I bought these based on the reviews and the price. Big mistake. I only get 6 hrs of ""dry"" time before my little one soaks through his clothes and leaves a big wet spot on the bed."
3,Not Bad but I would recommend Earth's Best,"Pros: Cheap,Free Shipping to home directlyCons: Has Chlorine and other Synthetic ugly stuff when compared with other productsMy daughter had a serious Rash, we turned to Earth's Best Organic Chlorine free diapers and It is worth it."
5,Great buy!,I have been getting these diapers since my baby was new born. My son bed stay dry for now all night. The diaper is really heavy by the morning but no concerns of leaks.
1,never buy it again,"use it as not using, the diaper even broke on the side...... never buy it again!!!!! it make skin rash, . babd bad bad !!!"
1,Diapers had strange stain,Some of the diapers in the box had a strange stain on them! Had to throw them out. What a waste. LM for Amazon to provide a refund.
2,Too smelly for me,"Well these diapers are ok as far as soaking capacity goes and I didn't have any problem with leaks. Size is pretty accurate as well.My problem with these diapers is the green color on the inside (that touches baby's skin), with strong chemically smell. We got Pampers at hospital as well, and they had similar smell. But green on these makes them even more unappealing. After having used other brands and cloth diapers for a long time, I just couldn't get past the smell and decided to cancel my subscription."
2,Wanted these to work for my youngest,"I used Pampers Baby Dry for my 2-year-old daughter with no problems. I started my youngest daughter on Swaddlers after she was born and when she started having leaks, we switched to Pampers Baby Dry diapers. They seemed okay at first, but then the leaks started again. She would leak out of the legs and would have blowouts out of the back. It was very frustrating for me. I know that the same diapers don't work for all babies, and this was the case for us! We're now using Target's Up & Up diapers with no issues!"
4,Great deal,"You cannot beat the deal you get on these diapers on Amazon.com! We have had a few problems with overnight leaks, but that was after 7-8 hours of sleep and a large cup of milk or two each time."
3,Pampers Review,These diapers seem to run small. My son is husky but usually wears a size 4 in diapers. The size 4 Pampers barely fit around his stomach. Daytime absorbency is fine since he is changed more frequently during the day. The pampers are not absorbent enough for a night time diaper.
2,Rashes and pee crystals,"This may be a kid specific thing, but little man got a terrible rash shortly after switching to Pampers. AND, diaper tearing - resulting in pee crystals. A HUGE diaper pet peeve of mine. Back to Huggies we go. :("
2,Poop everywhere!,"These diapers are great for pee (never leaks), but terrible for poop (frequently leaks). We've been using these for the past 2 months (my daughter is now 4 .5 months, average size). She is breastfed so her poop is really runny. Even if I literally run to change her as soon as I hear her poop, it still regularly squeezes up and out all over her back and clothes. Most days she messes her clothes at least once. I'm going to try something else because this is just ridiculous (and gross!)."
3,Not as good as swaddlers,The baby dry were not as good as swaddlers in my mind. We have had a lot of blowouts with these and hardy ever had them before. I think the waist doesn't cinch up as much - there is a gap between the diaper and our daughters back. I will switch back to swaddlers after this pack.
3,Pampers Baby Dry,"We have been using the Pampers baby dry diapers for a week now. As far as performance we are pleased. We are not experiencing any leaks and they fit our baby well. However, before I ordered them I kept wondering what was the difference between the baby dry vs. the swaddlers. As far as I can tell, the only difference is that the baby dry does not have the colored line to indicate when the diaper is wet. This feature is a huge plus when you are a new parent."
3,"Okay, but sag like crazy!",My son seems to go through more of these than Huggies or even my beloved Sam's Club brand. They sag really badly and don't hold as much urine. I got a great price on them so they worked for us.
1,"""Baby Wet"" should be the name!","Diapers don't absorb wetness at all, everything goes through clothes! Super thin too! Don't buy it! Waste of money for sure!"
5,The best,My son's skin sensitivity works great with Pampers. A great brand and a great loyalty to the brand has been our families opinion. We will always recommend Pampers.
4,Work for Us!,"Both of my kids (a boy and a girl) have used Pampers from birth. I like the Baby-Dry, they are nicely absorbent and seem to fit well. There was a big jump in size from 5 to 6. The 5s were getting small, the 6s are still quite big and she's been wearing them for about 3 months now. Because they are bigger, they have plenty of room for all the overnight filling."
1,Subscribe n save price increase 16%!,"I recently purchased a case of diapers and noticed that there was a huge increase in the diapers I bought. Nothing has changed, but the list price was ~$43 and increased to $51 within two months! This is a overwhelming increase. I don't know what is going on, but you can see the price comparison between other vendors that the Amazon price is significantly higher than Target or Babies R Us. With subscribe and save, it used to provide excellent savings, but now, I have to reevaluate and perhaps close my subscription! Rethink and check out other vendors!"
2,Diaper rash alert,"A little over a week of use, I noticed a bad diaper rash that rapidly progressed to blisters. They healed when I switched to a different diaper and broke out again when I tried to go back to using this diaper. I'm giving two stars because pampers agreed to refund my money even though I was outside the week window to return them to Amazon and because according to Pampers, this is the same formula they have been using for 20 years, which means they were my favorite diapers for my daughter."
4,Leaves of Grass,"Having read only tid bits, here and there, from Leaves of Grass, I found that it was full of truly unique American poetry. Whitman definitely achieved his goal of becoming a truly innovative poet. The fact that he rarely uses any type of meter, rhyme scheme, or exaggerated rhetorical devices almost says that he has mastered the basic fundamentals of poetry and surpassed his peers. He is so far above the simple and frequently used methods that he must create his own fresh and new style of writing. I found Leaves of Grass to be a lot to grapple with as a high school student, especially his philosophy pertaining to Deism, and yet, it was most intriguing and made me want to simply delve deeper into it. I look forward to completing Leaves of Grass and recommend it to anyone looking for truly original forms of American poetry."
1,Fallen Leaves,"Although he may be as genius as he is, Walt Whitman is just random. His structure and development are atrocious, leaving us in a cloud of confusion. His lists, names, and metaphors can only be described as random thought. And don't even get me started on his comma use. That's how my little sister writes for crying out loud! I mean, don't you remember? You'd get lucky if you found an ""and"" in there somewhere. Granted, he did revolutionize poetry and writing as we know it. However, certain selections for his ever famous Song of Myself show that he can sure describe those bodily actions that he seems to love so much. I can cut him some slack, probably because he's a romantic writer, but his random stringing of words, phrases, and lists do his poetry injustice. Poor Jonathon Edwards would be turning in his grave..."
2,Kindle Edition,"The Kindle edition of this great book is not well formatted, and is thus physically difficult to read. Line breaks appear in the middle of words, not always divided by syllable or in a way that would meet the approval of any author of a manual of style.Having only paid 99 cents for this tome, I can only comment that I suppose I got what I paid for."
5,will certainly outlast Bill & Monica,"Whitman set out, like James Joyce, to define and recreate his nation's literature, and perhaps the nation itself, and to express his wildest ideas, glorying in their contradictions. The amazing thing is that he succeeded. There's so much in this book, I wouldn't know where to begin to say any more, except to suggest that opening pages at random over a long period of time is my preferred method of reading this book."
2,A classic must read,NOT! So many times I have tried to catch up with classics I missed reading when I was younger. I found this almost impossible to wade through. I never finished it.
4,Gripping,"One of the best made-for-TV movies I've seen, gripping from beginning to end. You see the minute-by-minute unfolding of an atomic disaster just as it is reported in a live TV news broadcast. Unlike other TV movies that try to emulate theatrical films, ""Special Bulletin"", due to the way it is presented, is truly made to be seen on TV for greatest impact."
4,It's deja-vu all over again!,"I saw this movie when it was broadcast 24 years ago, and have never forgotten it. Although I never mistook it for an actual broadcast of a terroristic event (comparisons to Orson Wells' War of the Worlds notwithstanding), the realism and plausibility of the story were truly frightening. Some of you may remember the commotion caused by the 1979 movie ""The China Syndrome,"" about the cover-up of a nuclear accident. That film was released just weeks before the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island. Just as then, I had a palpable sense of deja-vu when I saw ""Special Bulletin,"" and 24 years later, when terror struck in New York City on 9/11, I was just 40 blocks away, and I thought ""it's finally happening."" Watch this movie - given today's political climate, it will scare the socks off you."
4,A vital piece of the New Mexico fiction reads,"The Bradford books, Red Sky at Morning and So Far From Heaven are two tomes slightly before their times. When most of the New Mexico fiction enthusiasts discovered Hillerman and Nichols these two had already gone into decline and were settling into obscurity. Each is well worth pulling from the bottom of the heap, dusting carefully and settling down for a great read.Red Sky at Morning would fit well into the John Nichols collection insofar as insight, humor and good story-telling. The characterization is great in both Bradford books; the plotting is excellent; the penetrating insights into a New Mexico forever in transition between a colorful past, chaotic present and incomprehensible future are all conveyed here.Whether the reader wishes to know New Mexico or simply to spend the evening in smiles and laughs, Bradford will provide."
1,Only if you like flying people,"I gave 1 star for Jet li, cause he is my favorite, but a guy in a boulder shooting him with lightning? Come'on, this movie is bad, Jet li is the man and Chingmy Yau is hot!, but this movie was just bad, too much flying. i dont know what these people are thinking giving it 5 stars, NO WAY not even close, see fist of legend thats 5 stars!"
1,Disgusting and poorly written,"Trick or Treat sounded like a great book from the blurb on the cover, What I found was vile and disgusting. I kept reading thinking it must get better. But no. It never got better. What I found was that the ending proved how really poorly written this book is--the author had multiple threads going. At the end, she dealt with none of them and ended on an improbability that only left more improbabilities. This is the only book I've ever consigned straight to the trash."
1,"battery replacement, wtf?","For those of you that haven't bought Polar, be forewarned that in order to replace the batteries, in either the watch or band, you will have to ship the device back to Polar.You cannot replace it yourself. You cannot go to a watch shop and have it replaced. You MUST send it to Polar.This process will cost you around $50 and you will have to go without your watch for several weeks.Since you can buy a Timex with similar functionality for around $60 and replace the battery yourself, or go to any local watch repair store, I highly suggest you go with something less stupidly designed."
5,You can make it learn to sew 2 dvd,This is the 2nd in the series and is great! I have watched it twice and so far bigin to sew a couple of things. I do very much recommend this series to any one wanting to learn to sew. It is FANTASTIC!!!!!!!
1,Elizabeth Hurley topless is all this movie has going for it.,"The only reason why I think this ""movie"" continues to actually exist is the fact that the luscious & amazingly gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley does topless nudity in the film.Other than that asset, this film is absolutely abysmal.Atrocious acting, hackneyed script, ham fisted direction and terrible lighting.It's not even good in a so-bad-it's-good type of way.Avoid at all costs and just download the Elizabeth Hurley nudity off of the internet."
4,"A strange film with a weird plot, but I LIKED IT!!!","Jurgen Prochnow, Patsy Kensit, and Elizabeth Hurley are well-cast in this odd little movie about two good-looking bar girls looking for a way to get to the Bahamas from their current home in Gibraltar. Jurgen Prochnow is the quiet drunk who offers them a lift in his boat/yacht. At first I thought he was the luckiest guy in the world, to have two such beautiful women all to himself for a couple of weeks at sea, and in the beginning it seems to live up to its potential. Needless to say, things get worse. I liked a lot of things about this film --- like the musical number the girls perform together for the crowd at the club in Gibralter. They were HOT! Anyway, it's not a GREAT film, but I still liked it!"
1,Worst racing game ever?,"This game is incredibly bad. I really can't stress that enough. It has aspirations of being fantastic and some of the obvious ideas expressed in it are great, but to say that they fail in meeting their goal would be a vast understatement. The game is virutally unplayable out of the box and requires you to download at least three (thus far) giant patches that still don't fix everything. I have a high-end computer that more than doubles the recommended requirements of this game and it still runs terribly. At the price, it's still a horrible investment."
4,Mystery of the Flying Express,"When I started reading it, it was hard to understand. The author didn't give very much information at the beginning of the book. After I read a few chapters I understood it. This isn't my favorite Hardy Boy book, but it has plenty of action, and it kept me on the edge of my seat. If you are a Hardy Boy fan you will find it anything but boring."
1,So very odd...,"I bought this book because of the good review I read in 'Preview' and was really kind of confused when I actually sat down and read it. I have never read anything like it, the whole set up and style was foriegn to me. I found the story itself pretty depressing. At least the parts of it I understood. I can see how some people would consider it deep and moving, but when I finished it I just felt like I had been tricked out of fourteen bucks. Read the first few pages of the preview on this site, it gives you a pretty good idea of the tone of the book. Wish that I had done that."
5,Excellent.,"Jason, Hey, Wait... (Fantagraphics, 2001)Graphic novel artist Jason made a huge splash with this slim volume when it first came out a few years back. It's pretty easy to see why; with a minimum of dialogue and a ot of abstraction, Jason paints a deeply affecting pastiche.The story concerns two childhood friends who decide to start a fan club. While they're planning out the initiation, something goes horribly wrong, and the rest of the book deals with one friend's lifelong reaction to a life-changing event.Hey, Wait... is unflinching. If you haven't yet come to the world of graphic novels, this is a great place to start; even the toughest critics of graphic novels, I should think, would be hard-pressed to deny the emotional power of this little tale (and it certainly puts to bed the idea that all comics are for kids). ****"
4,Clever and simple,"Jason's comic coming-of-age story has many gems. His simplistic style and steady pacing with the use of the same comic panels on every page forge a universe made of a very personal visual language. The lines between adulthood and childhood are clearly drawn (so to speak): adults are tired, working-class that rarely smile as they tread the streets on stilts; the two kids in the story have boundless imagination and their world is populated by undead bullies and comic monsters.The second part does not read as cleverly as the first, though done with the same care. The symbolism of the first half is only seen when the main character hits his lowest ebb. Its not clear why this character is made to suffer so much as his guilt succumbs to an unsatisfying life. Jason's very linear narrative could have used a little more complexity on this end but is otherwise a work that strikes a dark chord in regards to lost innocence and lost life and the parallels between the two."
3,Uumm new info,Well I didn't find much interest in this book but I did learn lots of new things from it. Each chapter kind of contains the same info as another chapter which is why I felt like I was reading things over n over
4,Great text...,"wish I had a better professor teaching the material. This is a great primer to the history of charity and philanthropy. I used it as a text for a Masters level course. The book taught me more than its presentation in the course, but... it happens..."
4,"For Shoes,waders,bike tires","This stuff can extend the life of a pair of shoes, waders, rain gear, or a punctured bike tire, my most frequent applications. For shoe soles, has worked best for me to apply several thin coats, allowing complete drying/hardening between coats--does not peel off quite so quickly as one thick layer which tends to get scuffed off all at once. Reliable patch adhesive & hole filler for patching bike tubes and leaky waders--works better than the rubber cement typically supplied with a patch kit. Agree with other reviewers that it's better to buy several smaller tubes, as it does dry out in the full-size tube faster than I can use it. Trick to removing from your hands or other places you do not want it is to rub with petroleum jelly (e.g. Vaseline) BEFORE it dries--should easily, quickly dissolve it."
4,Not Quite as Good as Aquaseal,"I use this mainly for repairing my fen boots. The surface needs to well roughened and clean for it to stick well. It shouldn't make a difference but the black version of this seems to have worked better than this clear version for me. It is thicker than Aquaseal so it doesn't go into as small crevices but it is cheaper and can be used when there is a wide gap between the surfaces, like for reattaching soles."
5,A Very Useful Product!,"Shoe Goo is great on soles of sneakers.I used to go through at least two pairs of sneakers in a year, but with Shoe Goo, I have been able to get at least a year (and often, more than that).I highly recommnend this fine product."
2,doesn't work as promised,"Tried to repair shoes that were pulling away from the soles...directions said to apply lots of glue, so I did. Once it dried, it made the shoes very heavy...so much so that I don't like to wear them anymore. It did seem to hold the soles back together pretty well, but again, made the shoes very heavy."
5,I use it for more than just shoes,"This is one tough glue. I have used it to fix rips in bicycle seats. Glue the rubber feet back to the base of items ect. I have had the same tube for years and I have used it on every gluing need I have had and it has performed beyond my expectations. It may not fix every shoe problem you may have but shoes take serious amount of twisting and flexing. The fact that this glue will hold the way that it does is worth having around. That is my opinion I hope you find it as useful as I have.Good luck,Matthew"
5,Great stuff!,"I had 2 pair of my favorite shoes come apart within a month. I did some research on line on what I could repair them with and found shoo goo. I glued them both ""back to health"" and have worn them several times since. At first I took an extra pair of shoes with me just in case the sole came loose again but that never happened. I love this product. I'm planning on buying the clear as well to use on my tennis shoes."
4,Very pretty,"I actually liked it very much and bought it in all three colors --peridot, amethyst and topaz. They very clearly state 3mm, hence I did not expect it to be big. The setting is more prominent than I would like but pretty all the same and seems secure."
1,DON'T LET THE TITLE OF THIS FILM MISLEAD YOU.......,"If you are looking for the Audrey Hepburn Story, then this is most definately not the place. While the film is whimsical and pretty to look at, a documentary film or biography on the late actress would be far more capable of telling the story. The title role was horribly miscast, and while Ms. Hewitt tries very hard, she lacks the age, grace and wisdom to conquer such a role. I was very dissapointed in the picture, especially at the fact that they dedicated three hours to such a small portion of Audrey Hepburn's life and only ten seconds to her work with UNICEF (the best ten seconds of the film). While Hewitt fans are sure to enjoy her in a role that was very obviously tailored for her, I urge people in search of the ""real"" Audrey Hepburn to look elsewhere."
4,Stunning,"Although Audrey Hepburn can not be compared to anyone, I feel that Jennifer Love Hewitt demonstrated Audrey's sweetness and innoncence very well. It is soo easy to understand how so many of us love Audrey, her charm and smile. I really enjoyed the way the movie was set up and I loved the costumes."
1,Hewitt is horrible. Story is inaccurate! The list goes on.,"First, I will give Jennifer Love Hewitt some credit... She did a wonderful job at slaughtering the story of a true film icon. But then, what do you expect from the co-executive producer who just happened to cast herself in the lead? Hewitt makes no secret that she's an Audrey wanna-be, and this movie just shows how hard she'll try (and how much money she'll spend) to be Audrey.I agree 100% with the reviewer that mentioned she would have rather seen a ""documentary style special."" So much of the 'Audrey Hepburn Story' is not even accurate and I think its a shame! Get the real Audrey story from RELIABLE sources... like A&E's biography or Lifetime's Intimate Portrait!"
2,a travesty,"This film did nothing to portray Audrey in the best light possible. sub-par acting (Natalie Portman was the obvious choice!!!), and the directing was 'off.' Also, that ""moon river"" crooning had to be a JOKE! Buy or rent one of Audrey's REAL films, and you'll be much better off."
4,Great find!,"I picked this up after seeing a review in Pitchfork, and what an excellent find this is! In some of his neosoul songs I hear Cody Chestnutt, Martin Luther, Bill Withers, and even Anthony Hamilton on a ""Change Goin to Come."" He astutely covers a range of styles from latin and hip hop to R&B. The carribean flavor of a couple of the songs surprised me - I'd never heard of an artist intermingling neosoul with latin, but Blacc pulls this feat off with aplomb ease. Not all the songs are consistent throughout, but his beautiful vocals and fine production make this a superb first effort. I really like the song where he is singing about waiting for a bus at the bus stop. This song really displays the honesty and spontaneity of his artistry. Highly recommended!"
3,Average Attempt,"I enjoy reading John Douglas's books; I have always found his insights interesting. This book is not up to par with some of his other works, however. Perhaps it is because these are cases that remain unsolved and much that he would use in ""working cases"" has been muddied by years of mystery. Perhaps the best thing he says is that all killings deserve equality in the press -- that the press shouldn't single some cases out because of some sensational in the case, whether it be the brutality or the wealth of the family. Everyone deserves for their suffering to receive equal attention."
1,Misleading rhetoric from self adulating Douglas,"Typical Douglas, in his self aggrandizing style, makes himself the authority on all crime related topics. If Douglas could downsize his ego, it would make it easier to read. For example, despite what the police, the state, and even his former colleagues in the FBI considered about the Ramsey case, Douglas ""alone"" has it solved -- i.e. the parents, from whom he took a substantial sum of money for his ""consultation"", are innocent. Incredible that Douglas makes such a conclusion, even though he wasnt privvy to the evidence, as the FBI was and who came to a markedly different conclusion about the parents' involvement.A waste of time to read this book. I have to agree with McCrary and Ressler, two greatly respected FBI profilers, that Douglas has gone Hollywood."
3,Not bad...could have been better,"I read a previous book by John Douglas and was fascinated by the science of profiling. As a result, I also enjoyed this book. I believe the book could have been improved by not including the Lizzy Border case; the Bembenek story; and the Black Dahlia case, none of which many Americans are really familiar with. Douglas could have included theories about the more reknown cases such as the Green River Killer and the OJ Simpson case. The book is certainly worth a read if you enjoy the true crime genre."
2,Pretty much useless,"Generally, it and its wall wart just adds useless clutter. Doesn't hold much charge (might double the life of the average cell phone). Three or four times as large and heavy as the average cell phone. Not much in the way of uses: most of the time, you're going to be near an electric socket, a usb port or a car's cigarette lighter recepticle, so might as well just get the appropriate wires."
3,Battery Backup,"I bought this as a battery backup for my MP3 player. I use it to listen to audio books on airline flights. It does the job fine, but I feel it is overly heavy for the job and has features, like an AC output, which I really don't need. My only real gripe is that it takes a very long time to recharge."
2,"Charges on the cheap, or not","It's a little bigger and bulkier than an SNES game cartridge. It's about the weight of a shoe. I tested it on my Zune 30 and my friend's iTouch 8gb. It didn't charge the iTouch at all, so don't count on that. It charged my Zune, but took pretty much two of these using the USB charging outlet to charge it from completely empty (non-functioning) to completely full (green battery icon). I plugged in my Zune AC wall charger into the pocket power AC outlet and had a little more success. It didn't quite take two. It didn't charge my laptop.I gave it two stars based on the Amazon price. I got two for $15, and would give it three based on that. I guess I can only recommend this if you find two really cheap and you have a Zune."
2,battery backup time,i needed a battery back up just in case if i am unable to plug in my wall charger. i tested this unit several times after fully charging the back up unit and it will charge my cell phone for 20 minutes and then it will run out of energy.the price dropped dramatically here on amazon so i am guessing it is being discontinued or it is on clearance.i am going to look for another back up unit
5,When you're tired of Vegas,"As a three going on four year resdient of the Silver State, I highly recommend this book for even short term visitors who want to see something more than the Vegas strip. There's more to Nevada than casinos - beautiful desert vistas and some really offbeat places, like Area 51, are a welcome break from the neon."
4,Great R&B song,"I first heard it on TV - the video. I wasn't actually watching it but the (as the previous reviewer mentioned) sythesized bass caught my attention. I buy almost only club music/mixes from shops like perfectbeat or beatport, but this song sounded special. For me it has great catchy beat, is dark, sexy vocals (and the vocalist!), great video that is different from all other videos like Beyonce's Deja Vu (her worst video ever). The song is Dark & Sexy. What else do you need?"
1,"Cassie is good eye-candy,but wack musically","this song is ok nothing special. vocally ain't much to Cassie,but the Lyrics&overall vibe make this song work."
1,Seemed like a good concept...,"First off, let me say that I have been braiding hair for two decades and although I am not a licensed professional, I think I would definitely qualify as an experienced braid technician, or whatever you wish to call it. I bought this product because I thought, ""Wow! This is pretty cool! It might spare the tips of my fingers from being burned"". Well, I was wrong. It doesn't ""cut"" the braid as described. It burns off the bottom portion and creates a finished look that is quite tacky considering that you have to clamp down on the braid longer than you might expect just to ""cut"" it. I ended up using my lighter. Whoever designed this should get back to the drawing board. Do not buy this product unless you want the end of your braids to look like a big flat piece of melted plastic. To give this item one star is giving it way too much credit."
5,Bridesmaid Dresses - great value for the money,"I purchased 4 of these dresses in black. One extra small for my 12 yr old daughter(12/14 in girls), a small for my 14 yr old daughter (1/2 in ladies) and 2 larges for other bridal party members (8-10 in ladies). The dresses pretty much fit everyone perfectly. I am having all hemmed, but my 14yr old who is 5'5"" and the dress falls right below the knee on her, the other ladies are shorter and the dress fell mid-calf. We were very pleased with the dresses. Quality was consistent throughout all the dresses, material a little thin, but for the cost of the dress it was acceptable. I was very pleased and everyone looks great!! Getting married October 2nd, 2010 - can't wait. I was a little nervous with all the reviews being all over the place regarding sizing, quality, etc. I recommend these dresses. Also, they came very fast!"
1,TERRIBLE,"This dress adds 100 lbs, i swear. It is a good price, but you would look better naked. It is unfortunate, but please save yourself and do not purchase this dress."
4,Bridesmaid Dress,Dress was exactly as described. The fit was true to size. Perfect color. The dress is just what we needed for a perfect bridesmaid dress.
3,frustrated,"I like this dress and its affordable price. However, when I ordered the size according to the measurements, it was much too big for me. I sent it back for an exchange in the manner they said to do. However, they didn't send me an exchange, they just gave me a refund. By the time I realized what had happened, I had to pay $20 for expedited shipping in order to make sure I get it in time for my friend's wedding."
4,Great dress,"I love this dress. I ordered this dress at the last minute and it was delievered in due time. I even had a few days to spare before my big event and had the dress altered. Since I am a big girl, I ordered a 3X and it fit very well. I received ALOT of compliments. The material is strong. I personally think it's worth the time and money. The color I ordered was black."
3,Alright,Not really crazy about purple but I was a bridesmaid....sized a little smaller than most clothing.
3,"Love it, but the sizing is way strange","As soon as I saw this dress I had to have it..it's all retro hotness, so I thought it would be perfect for dinner parties and such. It arrived and I've worn it only once. The bust portion is WAY big (I'm a 36C and usually have the reverse problem with dresses) and the waist is a little tight (I'm a size 14). This was my first strapless dress, so I felt a little self-concious with the loose bust enough as it was. I think I could deal with it if it came with straps."
5,Very Very Pleased!,"Was hesitant to purchase because of the price. I was not expecting such quality for the price. I am very very pleased with the fit. It came with a matching shawl and satin straps that I can attach to the dress myself, which I thought was nice because I don't really feel comfortable wearing strapless dresses. I actually ordered two other styles of dresses from this company when I purchased this one to make sure I had a dress suitable to wear for my occasion. I was pleasantly pleased with all of them. They all fit well. I purchased Mediums (my measurements are 34-29-41, pear-shaped) and this dress flatters my figure. I will be purchasing others. I found that the dresses fit according to the sizing chart that is one of the pictures shown."
2,"What was this about, really?","Planning a trip to both of these wonderful places and was tickled to see a book with both in the title. Unfortunately, the book was just strange ramblings and I never could find a point."
3,OK but not quite there,"This book addresses 2 topics, both digital photography and Photoshop Elements 3, doing an average job of each. It's reasonably easy to read, but doesn't quite work for me. I was most keen on the PSE3 section and found the flow odd .... I would have thought after the intro about accessing photos, basic editing would have followed. No, instead there is discussion around line drawings and adding text etc, not closely related to photography.As most photos are black & white and printed on average quality paper, it is sometimes difficult to appreciate what is happening when following editing of photos.I was disappointed that it doesn't discuss basic editing of RAW files, nor does it really discuss workflowsOverall, an easy read and an OK/good intro book, not quite hitting the mark"
5,A Thousand Years of History in one concise book,"Ostrogorsky's History of the Byzantine State is an excellent book for the scholar, as well as the interested reader to use for any understanding of the history of the Byzantine Empire. Well written, concise, and thoroughly interesting, Ostrogorsky depicts the transition of a multi-cultural Late Roman Empire, to a smaller but more centralized and powerful Byzantine State, that became the cultural Renaissance for Eastern Europe and the Near East. Anyone wishing to expand his/her knowledge on this important time in history will not be disappointed to read this work"
5,Fantastic work,Recommended for anyone serious about understanding the Byzantine Empire in depth. A richly detailed examination of of both the topic and its historiography.
4,Can be a migraine trigger,"Very talky, lots of fun, and a tour de force for both Olivier and Caine. In fact it's overload for some viewers, i.e. if your idea of a great film isn't a dialog between just two characters for 2+ hours, you'll likely hate this movie. Personally, while watching ""Sleuth"", I kept expecting Jon Lovitz to pop out of a closet and yell, ""ACTING!""If a few of the props in ""Sleuth"" look strangely familiar, they're from original ""Twilight Zone"" episodes."
5,Masterpiece of suspense and wit.,"Two great stars of the 20th Century combine in this classic whodunnit which might more correctly be termed a who-exactly-done-what-to-whom-and-when? Stage and screen legend, Laurence Olivier, and Michael Caine perform an intricate pas de deu which at all times engrosses while being witty as well as devilishly clever. Highly recommended viewing."
4,Not about content but presentation,"I am writing this review having not seen this film but having just bought it. I wanted to warn anybody potential buyers that this version of Sleuth is flawed. It claims to be a Widescreen presentation, but the credits clearly run off the side of the screen. Also, the label of the film looks like really questionable as if someone printed out labels on their computer and slapped them on the tape. There is not even a running time on the actual tape. Although people who do not like Widescreen probably will not mind, those that do like widescreen will be rather annoyed by this false advertising. The image is a little wider than the standard format, but not wide enough. And it is so blatant. At least make it less obvious! But oh well. I hope the film is good."
5,Worth the Trouble,"This is one of the hardest books of Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's to find in some areas, but it is worth any trouble you have to go to find it. It's a gorgeous tale bringing together many of the popular characters from Yarbro's vampire novels--Saint Germain, Rogerian, Aumtehotep and Olivia. The attention to Roman history tied in with the personal stories of the characters is some of the most skillful writing I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. I fully intend to recommend this novel and its fellows to my historical fiction professor. If you have an opportunity to read this book, then grab it. You'll be grateful for it."
4,"Sensual, compassionate historical vampire romance","Ms. Yarbro takes St. Germaine to the ancient world of the Roman Circus and the cruelties that men can to in the name of power and entertainment. Germaine is far more compassionate and kind than most of the so called normal humans. His great love and respect for life cost him dearly, but also allow him to meet a great love for all time"
2,5 stars for content; 2 stars for the format,"Avoid any edition from bnpublishing -- this is the second I have unsuspectingly bought and both are laid out exceptionally poorly, to the point that they are difficult to read.I think this book was taken from an ASCII text file in the public domain, copied and pasted into Microsoft Word, then printed. It is that amateurish.If you can get past the hard-to-read format (weird line breaks, missing paragraph indentations, typos, etc.) this book will change your life."
4,Great Buy,I brought this product for my nephew to wear at my wedding. They look great with his black suit. After trying on the shoes my sister turned around and brought her son more footwear from amazon.
3,nice shoe but laces are cheap,"These shoes are very nice and my son wears them every week on Saturday, but the laces came apart after about a month's worth of wearing. I guess I kind of expected better."
2,Experience notes are missing to be practical,"Apart from the first few pages I lost the author as observations based on experience was put to an end. The remaining chapters are based on mechanics of Spells. Conclusions drawn from observations is far greater in value than mechanics with no real experience notes as to what worked or what failed or how should the performer be feeling when all is going right and when it is out of sync. See works of Joseph C. Lisiewski, Ph.D. on Time and Flow and practicality to a reader in day to day work processing. This work Moon Spells misses this value to end user who wants to Do, Observe, Correct and again Do, Observe, Correct processes in his or her efforts to make a better quality of life."
3,My review of the Last Days of Patton,"I recently purchased a copy of THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON. I was a fan of George C Scott and his works since a I saw Patton some years ago and I was pleased by Scott's reprised role of OL BLOOD & GUTS the movie goes into detail about the months after Germany surrenders and the US rebuilding of Germany. The movie is a source of information, but when Patton is involved in a fatal car wreck the movie goes down hill, because all u c is Patton layin a bed for a 1 and a half havin flashbacks of him during his youth, it is one of the longest deaths scenes in history"
4,good follow up,"this movie is not a academy award winner, but documents the life after the war in germany, and general patton's need tostill be a effective leader even with the buracey of post ar germany.this movie fill's in the gap's after the opriginal 1970movie. the dvd is a decent version, but needs to becleaned upa bit."
1,Movie Quit in middle and wouldn't reload.,Watched movie till halfway point and then just quit playing. Tried several times with no success and even moved to a different machine. Only paid $ 5 so I should have suspected something. Not worth the effort to mail back to seller.
5,DVD and Product Review,"The ""must have"" companion to ""Patton."" George C. Scott reprises his role with the same insight and depth of portrayal that won him the Oscar for ""Patton."" The DVD version is excellent, and arrived exactly when promised."
4,A great conclusion to PATTON!,"I enjoyed learning about the ending of Patton the man. Not as fast paced as Patton but really entertaining. We feel pitty for this warrior of a man in his unfortunate condition. I enjoyed the emotions drawn from his desire to remain the leader in charge, of a situation which he has no control. You'll enjoy this ending saga of a leader who will be a forever part of world history."
4,A personal voyage through India's railways,"The author is a Brit who has lived in India for a long time. He has written a number of books on travels to various parts of India,most of them covering train journeys to some extent. This book may be considered as a series of somewhat unconnected essays about different aspects of the Indian railways. He has a keen eye for observation of the nuances of life in India. This is not a travel guide, but a good account of various things which would be of interest to the railfan or anyone who is interested in knowing more about India and its trains."
3,This book was okay,"This book was okay, but there were a couple of things I didn't like. There were a couple of questions that the writer didn't answer, like what happened to Travis and Priscilla. Those are some loose ends that were not tied up. I did like the ending. I would think this book is for kids ages eight and up. There are some things that are hard to understand, and there are no pictures. I liked that there was a map in the front that tells where everything in the story is located. I would recommend this book for people that like chapter books and for people that want to learn about Florida."
4,look good,cant wait to put some pictures on them saw on pinterest to mod podge a pic on it to make it look like its canvas and good price!!
3,House of Madness,"Flawed but interesting retelling of the classic Poe tale. Oliver Reed gives a very good performance as the ailing Roderick Usher and Donald Pleasence is wonderful as his insane older brother Walter. The sets are also well done. Only a few elements of Poe's tale remains and the ending is pretty lousy, but overall it is an entertaining,well paced, and somewhat bizarre gothic horror film."
4,"Content=Fabulous, Format=Tedious","The recipes are delicious, and directions are thorough, as other readers have noted. I have owned this book for several years, and have one complaint. No recipe is all on one page or even consecutive pages. Once you find what you want to make, you have to flip back to the pastry part of the recipe. Then you have to find the cooking directions for the pastry. Then you flip back to the item you want to bake. Sometimes, in the course of that recipe, it says to use a particular technique and refers to another page. I made a pecan tart with wonderful results (and many compliments), but had to find information in no fewer than four different parts of the book to accomplish this. This book is only for people who are very good readers who follow directions well and are not easily discouraged."
5,another wonderful guide to baking,"Rose has created yet another essential guide to the world of baking. My only concern is that it might take her another ten years to put out her next masterpiece. She is, as usual, concise, clear, and oblivious to calorie counting, so you can be assured of turning out desserts that your family and guests will swoon over without having had to attend culinary arts schools around the world. For those of you who have and enjoy her Cake Bible, ponder this a moment: Rose relates to us that, while she likes cake, she's really a pie person--can you imagine to extra effort that went into this book? How can you resist?"
1,don't waste your money,I love pie but not this book. I have been consistently disappointed with the seven recipes I have made from this book. I followed the directions carefully but a crust that the author raves about as her favorite was dry and crumbly and lacked flavor. Several fillings were similarly lacking in flavor. Author admits a bias against fillings she deems overly sweet but her versions seemed bland to me and to my tasters. I understand tastes differ but I have not found one recipe in this book that I would make again.
5,The Illustrations rule!!!!!!,I loved this book for my kid. He thought the pictures were great. The are so colorful and lively. He is four and just loves all the baseball stuff. The story is pretty good too. I am going to buy this book for all my neices and nephews cause i am sure they will love it too. BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!
1,not the right fit,"This belt was not the right fit, we used the letters and numbers off the belt to place the order.... but still would not fit it was too big."
5,Masterpiece,"I've just started exploring jazz and this is definately the best album I've bought so far. With this album, John Coltrane takes you on a journey. It's as if you're watching a movie. A real masterpiece, which you can listen over and over and over..."
2,A BORE SUPREME...A BORE SUPREME...,"I bought this CD. I listened to this CD. And then I listened again, and again...ad nauseum. I get jazz. I love jazz. I ""get"" spiritual jazz. This music is a load of crap. It is boring, goes nowhere, and I fail to see why, when so much brilliantly done spiritual oriented jazz has been created, one would rather kneel at the alter of such mediocrity. That Coltrane may have advanced the modal boundaries of jazz/sax does not a great (or even good, evidently) album make. Trance-inducing offerings by Szabo, Tjader, Byrd, Hubbard, Hancock, Hutcherson, Horn and many others actually DO achieve the accolades unrightfully heaped upon this monotonous drone of a squak, so forego the lip service paid this and pursue those players for genuinely moving soul food if you, too, are able to listen to the MUSIC with your ears, instead of the hype."
4,Great but not his best,I know that everyone insists this is the mother of all Coltrane albums. Don't get me wrong it's a fine piece of work. I just don't see the rainbows and stars shooting out of the cd player when it is on.
5,"Guaranteed to stir even ""non-religious"" types","I usually ignore the ""religious"" or ""sacred"" tag in a piece of music and find that I still can fully appreciate the pure musical beauty of it. This album could easily be enjoyed in a similar vein for its sheer passion and energy. (religious or otherwise). So even if you are turned-off by these this ""spiritual"" hype surrounding this landmark album go ahead and buy it! Like Miles Davis's ""Kind of Blue"", the hype is more than justified."
5,Like Coltrane,My friend is in search of his interpretation of God. So I gave this cd to him to help him on his quest. I hope he finds what he is looking for. <3
2,"Same movie as ""Lassie"".","I am little disappointed about this is. This is the exact same movie as ""Lassie"" I bought in November - just different cover.I love the movie but I am disappointed about the ""misleading marketing trick"". That's why I only gave it a 2 stars."
5,Great Product,This black silicon cover fits my Treo Palm without a problem. I use it since the first day I got it. Great Product.
2,Doesn't close properly,"This case does provide some protection for my Palm, but it doesn't close well or stay closed... I've ended up using it with a rubberband around it."
2,Phone Cover,"Not the greatest produce. I have used the product for about 3 weeks and just recently took it off. The cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which I had to cut bigger. It attracts lots of lint from your pockets. I just haven't really been pleased with it. But for as cheap that it was, I shouldn't really complain."
3,Not as good as the last release (On Your Side),"His voice is still as good but the album is nowhere near as engaging as his earlier release ""On Your Side."" I would not purchase this one again if I had the choice. I'm going to have to look and see what the difference were in terms of the production crew because I can't find any other way to account for the lackluster feel of this CD."
4,You should get this album,"""An Irish Christmas"" is Moya's 6th album and was released last year in the UK. This CD is a beautiful listening experience for Christmas in Moya's signature sound. Many will know Moya as the first lady of Celtic music, the voice of Clannad and older sister to Enya. ""An Irish Christmas"" is a collection of Christmas carols celebrating Moya's beliefs in the Nativity. The good thing about this CD is that there are two songs added that where not included on the UK release but the bad thing is Moya's two original songs from the UK release where not included on this CD. My favorite song from this CD is ""Carol Of The Bells"" which is perfect for Moya's haunting vocal style. Her song ""Oiche Chin"" Galic for ""Silent Night"" is sure to be a hit as her two children sing with her on it. This CD brought a touch of Ireland to my home last year with the UK release and I am sure will this year with this release."
5,the most sexist cookbook ever written,"My mom bought this for me when I went to college. She felt that it might help in preparing quick, cheap meals. While the book does detail some decent recipes and contains some basic tips for the novice cook, it also provides instructions of a different type, that of cooking up some romantic love. The main theme of the book is that if the co-ed cannot cook, then she cannot catch and keep a man. The book is damn funny with chapters titled such as ""Day Dreams Do Come True"", ""Men Love Meat"", and my favorite chapter ""Is He a Fisherman?"". If you want to learn to cook or to make cheap meals, skip this book, but if you want to laugh your ass off, don't miss this one."
5,Title Grossly Understated,"This is the book I was looking for in Highschool, but never found, it not having been written yet. So, I started writing it myself. I am still writing, and then a friend points out its existence. Better than mine, and as if a commentary on mine. Excellent work. Only those who have spent a large portion of their lifetime asking the right questions will realize this book has many of the right answers, and, expressed very succinctly. what I took 20,000 pages and 20 years to find, he condenses beautifully to his first 100 pages. Awesome. Sublime. Profound. Genius unrecognized as such in his own time. If you think it is too long, you have no idea how short it is; you are too immature for the subject and should indeed go with your gut feeling and not bother to read it and go watch Paris Hilton or The Jonas Brothers; such greatness you are not worthy of."
5,Will read again,"I finished this book the other day and as soon as I digest it a bit, I will read it again. To me this is a very important book.For someone interested in witchcraft and shamanism this is essential reading."
3,Short short and short!,I bought these pants for my boyfriend's Bday and when he put them on they looked like clam diggers.... at a normal height of 6'1 they sat above his ankles!!! I have requested a return but no one from the company has even contacted me to find out why or ask if they can fix it in anyway. Not impressed.
5,Classic Silk ~ Classic Quality!,"This ""Classic Silk"" pant has a classic-style design and quality of a bygone era. Combine this dense and durable authentic silk pant with a sport-knit top, smoking jacket and a pair of crocodile slippers...and you'll give even Hugh Hefner a run for his money. Honey-bunnies just can't resist a man in classic, luxurious silk! Live long and lounge well..."
5,Very comfy,"These sleep pants are really comfy, fit perfectly, and look pretty good, too! They are definately real silk, and while I could do without the pockets, I love sleeping in them."
5,great story,"Stirling was a ne'er do well who irritated other officers. He created the SAS out of nothing, and used cast off equipment, to harry Rommel's Afrika Korps with very few people. At one point, a general proposed to give him a Distinguished Flying Cross, because he destroyed over 250 German planes, with far less expenditure than any other branch. He made a lot of mistakes, early on- like Geronimo- but he persevered. Fascinating story.Geronimo: The True Story of America's Most Ferocious Warrioris a comparable, as isPopski's Private Army (Cassell Military Paperbacks)."
5,extremely well polished and Produced album,"I grew up a big Styx fan and followed them through the years. I bought this on cassette way back in 1987 and a few years later I found the original Atlantic CD in some dscount bin (what a find!).I think this is the BEST Shaw solo effort (""What If"" comes in very close though).The songs have a very rich texture and are very well produced. Songs like Outsider and Lay them Down are very well done. No Such thing, the only single and video is a great rocker. I was amazed the album totally bombed in 1987 and even more shocked when a few years later Tommy Shaw become a household name when he scored the No.3 hit with Damn yankees, it was Atlantics time then to re-release this album and market it, they seriously dropped the ball or prob didnt even remember they signed him to a one time record deal.This remains a lost treasure. The songs are great, there isnt a crappy song on this album. a solid 5 stars."
5,Candid comments about his own observations.,"Excellent book for someone trying to obtain insight into characters of the conflict. Sorrel is candid and generally does not fall into the ""hero worship"" that many Confederate Officers did when writing their memoirs.He makes it very clear throughout the book that his observations are his own and may be flawed when viewed historically (and some are).Very easy reading -- not a lot of Victorian memorializing and generally flows well. A real good book for the beginner or historian alike."
3,buyer beware!!,"Bought this product as a ""new"" product. Got it, and installed it, and it would not work. The base was ok,but the light would not come on. My dad has the same thing,so we tried his light,and his worked great. Upon closer inspection, we found that the bottom plug on the pole light where it plugs into the base had been tampered with and opened before. This item appeared to be in factory packaging, but the light pole had plier marks on it where I guess someone else tried to get into the wiring after it would not work for them. After about 2 hours of working with it,and rewiring it, we finally got the pole to work. I was very dissapointed that this seller advertised this as a new product, when it was clearly used, just repackaged."
3,Pretty Good Lugosi Vehicle,"Lugosi's horror movies of the late thirties and forties for Monogram pictures weren't particularly memorable or ingenious, but they served their purposes and were reasonably entertaining. In this movie, Lugosi is haunted by the ghost of his dead wife, and every time he sees her, he is put in a murderous trance. The plot is kind of hokey, but there are a few atmospheric scenes, and the acting is surprisingly good for this kind of movie.The DVD from St. Claire Vision is in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Unsurprisingly for a public domain horror movie, the picture is plauged with scratches, and it is consistently blurry (although if you're shopping in the bargain bin, like I did, you should know what to expect). There are no extra features, which is also unsurprising."
3,Bela's First Monogram Thriller,"""The Invisible Ghost"" (1941) features an effectively underplayed Bela Lugosi performance and some striking directorial touches courtesy of Joseph H. Lewis - eight years before his cult classic ""Gun Crazy."" As a result, this atmospheric thriller rises above the usual Poverty Row fare. Clarence Muse provides memorable support as the non-stereotypical butler. One of Lugosi's best Monogram efforts. The Roan Group DVD includes a good 35mm print and the original trailer."
1,Broken within 2 weeks,"I used this product for less than an hour a day, and the band broke within two weeks."
2,This is really for a teacher or counselor,"I was just curious as to what it talks about. I read the foreword only and I felt as though it was not only realistic but outlined as though there is some formula for someone to like you. It may have been informative for someone else but not for me because I do not care who does not like me. Usually people that do not like you do not like themselves and you remind them of something that they are not and never will be.I passed it on to someone else. If you buy this keep in mind that if you love yourself, to not care what someone else thinks becomes second nature. Books cannot generalize a subject like this because everyone is different and there is always inner spirits of people in conflict with one another. If people do not like you that means you are doing something right. Probably not everything but something."
1,Cheaply made!,"These weights break apart VERY easily...the material is very cheap. They don't last and not worth the money, even on sale"
5,very satisfied,have nothing negative to say about this product. Very please!delicious satisfying I use these every day and I have no problems with any leakage from the product. Thanks for such a marvelous product.
2,Ripped After 2 Months,"I purchased these weights for my 9 year old daughter, who has a petite build. They fit perfectly on her ankles, but would likely be too small for anyone over 5 feet. After wearing them a couple of times each week for two months, a rip developed along one of the seams and the sand came out. This is upsetting because otherwise these weights were perfect for my daughter - snug fit, soft fabric."
1,Not what I thought,These are a real disappointment. I thought I was buying 2 2lb weights. What I recceived was 2 1lb weights. they are very small and hard to get over my hands. I keep them overnight on a beer glass so that I can put them on. The accompanuing folder was for women. I will never againybuy items like this va the internet.
1,Useless Waste of Money,These one pound wrist weights are pointless. They offer no useful weight resistance. My watch is heavier than these!
2,Get ready to play pick up.,If you have large/thick wrists do not purchase this product. Each weight is a pound of tiny beads inside an oddly shaped design. Think of an oval that is thick on only two opposite facing curves. The given picture shows the thick sides but the surrounding edges are very thin.Cutting to the chase there is a high probability that the cloth will be cut or worn out very fast and you will have tiny beads leaking and spilling everywhere.Look elsewhere for wrist weights.
3,wrist weights,I found the weights to be of good quality. I do not have any other comments for this product at this time
1,Way Too Small!,"Do not ignore the previous posters complaints about the size of these weights. I did! I'm a woman with a wrist 6.75 inches in diameter and I wear a size 7 or medium glove. These weights are extremely hard to get on and very uncomfortable to wear. I really think they are only suitable for a child or a very, very small woman.Also the weights I received do not look like the pictured item. Valeo seems to have changed the entire design of these. Maybe they were better before? The pictured item seems to have a larger diameter in the opening. The ones I got desperately need some elastic or something."
2,too small,"Very hard to put on, they are not very big, and I am a slender petite woman with little hands & wrists, but it feels like I am scraping my skin to get them on and off, do not care to wear them at all. Look nice, built well, but need to make bigger. Going to see if I can return them or resell them myself."
2,not so great,came in great timing but after useing them for afew workouts a little sand came out of the seam.
4,Easy Workout,Comfortable to wear on your wrists while you are walking or just doing every day choirs. I wear them a few hours a day on days I don't go to the gym. They appear to be doing the job of firming my upper arms.
3,"Okay, but not great","As a primer I got this book, Jill Dyche's CRM Handbook and John Freeland's The Ultimate CRM Handbook. While you probably could use all three to get a full understand of a very broad topic, I personally found the other two to be more insightful."
1,"Beware, only Castillian spoken here",This set is fine if you only want to learn Spanish in the Castillian accent. Castillian is a rare accent that you will encounter in certain areas of Spain. No Latin American countries use Castillian! You'd be better off with a different set of software if you truly want to learn the Spanish that most native speakers use.
5,"Can't talk, Need to save Hyrule","This is THE soundtrack to buy. Don't go for the English version. Who needs English anyway? I am taken aback each time I listen to this soundtrack. It is so great. The sound is crystal clear. With every song, I am taken back to Hyrule itself. Over 80 tracks, this soundtrack leaves nothing behind. Did I mention the sound? I'd love to review more, but this soundtrack has made me want to play the game again."
3,"Use Only if you have very Dry, Damaged Hair...","I have a difficult time finding a shampoo that's ""just right"" for my combination hair: oily at roots, dry at the ends. I mostly use a daily shampoo for normal/oily hair but then my ends can really dry out, so ocassionally I need to indulge with some Moisturizing shampoo or conditioner. So, I decided to try this product. MAN. This is very ""nourishing""...it made my hair look so ""oiled down"" that I thought that maybe I didn't rinse it all... After a 3rd rinse, I still couldn't blow dry the ""wet look"" away.I'm sure that it is a good product if your hair is VERY dry. Not good for normal hair and if your hair is slightly oily, stay away!!"
5,Beautiul music (and I hate the game too..),"Yes, I'm one of those people who hate FF8. Having said that, I heard a friend play this music one time, and not being that familiar with the music, I was intrigued. He told me what it was and after listening to 2 tracks, I bought the album. And it's nothing short of GREAT. The composer is a genius, and I'm now thingking about getting all the Piano Collections. It's a shame not many people know that game music is as beautiful as this."
3,strangely limited,"The book has a very narrow view, focused on ultimate luxury and non-afrikaaner history. oddly, safe is equated with boring. hotel guide is absurd, with proices rangeing from expensive to stratospheric. despite the above, it does contain decent and useful information, and is worht the money. it cannot, however, serve as the sole bookin in planning a trip."
3,Not One of Her Best,"A longer novel than usual for Christie, ""Cat Among the Pigeons"" deals with international intrigue at an exclusive English girls' school. A coup in the Middle East triggers off a deadly search for missing jewels. Action converges on the school. The Special Branch and local police try to solve the string of murders among the schoolmistresses, but it takes Hercule Poirot's little grey cells to see through the disguises and subterfuge and bring all the loose ends together. The plot seemed flimsy at times and some of the attitudes expressed in the novel made it appear dated in the extreme. For a better Agatha Christie set partly in the Middle East, I would recommend They Came To Bagdad."
4,How far can one go?,"How far can a person really go to kill, to slice on'e self, to glide through the world of evil. Poirot, the belgian detective scrambling through the holes of a mystery like a mouse, not powerful but ready to zoom in.That day when I went to the library he was prepared to zoom in to a barden school for girls. It seems very peaceful until two teachers die. The interesting thing about this book ias that Poirot comes at the end. Thsi is a sign.. at the end things gom wrong. In each Poirot mystery there is a lesson to be learned, a thread to pull on. Not 0only these suspects learn, but we do too! This book has elemants of a regular mystery but thery disapear to a far away island they do not escape but get covered. By Hercule Poirot, the suspects. And I still now am getting covered up. For Iam a cat among the pigoens, we all are and all will be."
4,Thinking horror,"It took me a while to get really ""into"" this one. However, I was really hooked from page one because I just couldn't put it down. The writing is lyrical, nearly poetic, the images created are haunting. The novel introduces a series of characters on a variety of levels; nothing is truly as it first appears in this novel. The Succubus is such an incredible character; she is erotic and dangerous without any other motive than to fulfill her purpose for coming to earth. Her image will stick with you throughout this read. The dialogue is intelligent and realistic, the images are sharp, and the plot keeps building throughout the novel. This is a must-read for the intelligent horror reader."
5,Third time's a charm,"I'm listening to this record for the third time as I write this, and it's not going to leave the CD player anytime soon. Immediate favorites on the disc are ""Pillars"", ""Every shining time you arrive"", the title song, and one of the last 3 (I don't recall- they're all good). In the words of Jeremy Enigk, ""The new album, pardon my french, is gonna kick a__!""- and it does. It's mellower on average than ""Diary,"" and all the new stylistic touches of s/t are used plus even more new stuff. The sonic variance gives them even more depth of expression and makes for a truly enjoyable listen. The lyrics are as great as I expected. I just can't praise it enough. An instant classic."
4,It's About Time to Write a Review for this Record,"Well I've owned this record for four years now, almost to the date. It's a great album- the guitars ring in counterpoint, the bass is melodic, the drums pound. . .subtely, and Mr. Enigk spouts forth a little LESS elliptically than in the previous two records. There's even a little piano line, etc. I think that this was their best studio recording, personally.Buy the album and love it."
1,Who is the translator?,"With hundreds of versions of The Cherry Orchard available, you would think that Amazon would have the sense to name the translator. I think this is the same version used by LA Theater Works in which case the translator would be Michael Frayn."
5,Timeless,"The Cherry Orchard was me first experience with Chekhov, and I was surprised at the depth in this 49 page play. By no means would I considered myself a ""literary expert,"" but this was very readable and you can pull a lot of the deeper meanings and its context in Russian history by yourself. I was confused at a couple people who write that the simply couldn't understand it and it put them to sleep! It's not THAT tough! If I could understand and appreciate it, almost anyone can!What I like most about Chekhov is that he doesn't simplify his characters. He's a realist in this sense. Lopahkin and Trophimof each have admirable and detestable characteristics, just like you and I. While it may be set in the tumultuous period prior to the Russian revolution, the ideas and the discussions this play provokes are timeless.Highly recommended!"
4,"Lego doors, windows, and roof tiles",Great for kids who like legos and never have enough doors and windows. Will keep them busy for hours.
5,Vocally obnoxious and musically brutal,"Start to finish, it's like Judas Priest on steroids and a singer that is so over the top on his highs it's like a banshee having a seizure. The music is heavy, catchy and intricate and his vocals soar over it all making it ten times more intense and fun, yes fun to listen to. Some disagree and think his vocals are TOO OTT but it all comes down to personal opinion. It's like a metal opera that is very dramatic. It can go from vengeance to a very emotional state from song to song and it takes you on a journey. You know those crazy Italians. They're intense in everything they do and it is all over this cd. I bought this purely because I thought the cover was ridiculously awesome. I mean, a centurion holding a pump action sawed off shotgun? Sold."
3,One Dimension of War,"Brian de Palma's film is based on a true incident during the war in Vietnam, in which some G.I.s decided to ""reward"" themselves for their efforts with a South Vietnamese girl, whom they proceeded to [attack], torture, and murder. Michael Fox is good as the ""good guy""; Sean Penn is better as the leader of the pack. All roles suffer from one-dimensionality."
3,depalma need i say more.,One of the best vietnam movies of all time. fox performance was great.sean penn also created a realm of dishonor. thet had not been seen in film before.depalmas direction was great as always and i think that it was an over all great movie. and a must buy for any one who likes war movies.
1,Poor,Disk#1 - too few wordsDisk#2 - starts with based on reading; but there are no lessons on how to readetc
3,Maggie Can do Better,"I almost didn't finish this book because it was so trite, but being a Maggie Osborne fan, I continued reading. In my opinion, it didn't get a whole lot better.I felt like another reviewer who said they suspected it was one of Osborne's first books and she lost her way in this story. If this had been my first Maggie Osborne book, I would not have continued reading more of her books, but this is one of the last books of hers that I have read, so I know she can do better. She is ordinarilly a fabulous writer."
4,Skip the the last three tracks ...,"... because that's all you need to hear. Absolutelyincredible. Aeris' Theme, The Overworld Theme and the most evilvillian music ever- One Winged Angel have all been arranged to a fullorchestra.The rest of the tracks are just mediocre in comparison,but the OST to VII was solid anyway, so they're good to hear.Butunfortunately, unlike the Final Fantasy VIII Arranged album (which isalso sold on amazon ... GET IT), 90% of these tracks are old and justrecycled off the original soundtrack. If you're a diehard fan and mustown everything, get it... those three songs are incredible. If youthink paying [this much] for three songs is too much, well- then passon this one."
1,Disappointed,"The book did bring back pleasant memories of attending a Catholic School. It's too bad that Gina Cascone hated attending a Catholic School. I kept reading hoping that at some time she would say something good about being a Catholic. But that never happened. If I hadn't experienced Catholic Schools myself, this book would convince me that sending your child to a Catholic school is child abuse. I only recommend this book for people who hated being Catholic."
1,Catholic bashing packaged as humor...,"I, too, grew up Catholic. I, too, have hilarious stories of my experiences. How lucky I feel, though, to have been raised to honor and respect my faith. Yes, my old friends and I still chuckle over certain eccentric nuns, over chapel veils and pagan baby collections, but mostly we feel lucky and richer for this experience. Since my patent leather shoe days, I've been widowed (young), lost my father (young), raised six children...no heartache or challenge has been too great, as I have been comforted and strengthened by this two thousand year old faith Gina Cascone so glibly dismisses. Had she remained true to her faith, some of what she says could be taken as good natured fun. She has instead turned her back on Catholicism and puts herself above sacraments and revered practices and beliefs. Her humor smacks of arrogance and ignorance. How sad."
3,Different and cool.,"It's been a while since I read this book, but I wanted to be the first one to review!! The book was filled with small excerpts from Dylan Thomas' life, many of which dealt with surreal type encounters. The first part of the book seemed to lag somewhat, but the last story got me hooked and then ended in a very odd way, which was really cool. Maybe I shouldn't be writing this, I'm no lit expert. I'd reccommend it though."
3,And they call this shampoo SPORT?!,"This could be a really good shampoo...but where is it written that shampoo must smell like a piece of candy? A lot of the ""good"" shampoos I've tried smelled like a candy bar..this one smells like a sour apple jaw breaker. YUCK!It's really a shame. This shampoo leaves your hair conditioned and clean. If it weren't for the aroma I'd give it five stars. But then I may not be a member of their target demographic. So if you prefer wine to a good craft beer, don't eat red meat, and are in touch with your feminine side, this may be the shampoo for you!"
4,One Of The Better Soundtracks,I'm not a huge soundtrack fan but this is a good soundtrack. It has all of the vocal songs from the movie along with most of the instrumental stuff. If you liked the music in the movie this would be a good buy.
3,Great for the movie...But....,"Many people enjoyed the soundtrack to the original Toy Story video...anybody who did will also like this soundtrack. They are both very similar, and Toy Story 2 has themes from the original movie mixed into some of the tracks. However, this soundtrack is not good to just sit down and listen to. Sure, it went perfect with the movie! Fun and happy. But I wouldn't recommend getting this soundtrack usless you really enjoyed it from the movie, and the original Toy Story music appealed to you. It's one of those half and half soundtracks. Get it or don't! Anybody who likes fun music and wants to add a piece to their Randy Newman collection, this is a good CD to do so with."
2,Ho-hum,"Not much new here. I listened to it for the Sarah song, and it is what gave it two stars. Not horrible, but the music is generic movie soundtrack music. The two versions of ""You Got A Friend In Me"" add nothing to the song. ""When She Loved Me"" is a nice song performed wonderfully by Sarah Mclachlan, but not enought to spend money on this whole CD."
2,Hope you like instrumentals!,"I bought this album expecting songs to sing with the kids. The music is probably great, but I have not yet gotten past the disappointment of so few sing alongs."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this CD for my 3 year old son after seeing the movie and absolutely loving it! We were so disappointed that we immediately returned it and got our money back! The CD only has 3 songs that are actually sung and the rest are all instrumental. My son was so excited to listen to the songs he had heard in the movie, but when they played they (the main song) was sung by a different person and just not the same. I am sorry to say this was not worth putting a CD together for...they should have just left it in the film for everyone to enjoy."
2,This book appeared to a small group of shepherd girls,"Unlike other religiously oriented books such as the Da Vinci Code, in this one you really have to take religion seriously. If you don't believe, then the book will look silly. If you do believe, then the book will make your beliefs look silly. Kind of a no-win situation. I found it boring.But, more importantly, can we stop publishing books in which ""suspense"" is created and maintained by telling the story from two or three perspectives, then breaking up these stories into three-page fragments?I swear, I almost grabbed a razor blade and cut the book up so that I could reassemble it into a coherent narrative."
5,Spellbinding thriller,"Another Da Vinci Code-like thriller - fast paced of course, but this one is very well written. The Third Secret is driven by the events of the miracle at Fatima, Portugal and a conspiracy in the Catholic Church, if you can imagine such a thing. The intricacies and politics of the Vatican are examined while the story races along, and coming on the heels of the latest conclave and installation of the new Pope just makes this book even more irresistible. Fascinating history, meticulously researched (as always by this author) and spellbinding to boot."
4,Fast paced mix of facts and fiction with no great secret,"If you are looking for a deep secret to be revealed at the end, read no further, its a let down. However, the storyline and the plots are fast-paced and intriguing, that it is unputdownable. It is set against the background of the catholic kingdom, the vatican city, and offers a mix of insightful facts and fiction about the people that run the catholic church. The details of the ceremony and procedures followed upon a pope's death, the conclave and election are instructive.Overall, its a good weekend book that should not be mistaken for a serious theological treatise."
3,Pretty Good,"At least this book didn't try to tear christianity in half - it was quite spiritual and still managed to dispel all the ""falderal"" of the Vatican. Berry is an excellent author and you should read his offerings."
4,"A good, tight piece of FICTION.",People take these books too seriously. It is a work of FICTION that draws upon history. Read it and enjoy it for what it is. It's not the gospel.
1,"I don't normally write reviews of books I didn't finish, but...","... the first dozen or so pages are crammed chock-a-block with most every anti-Catholic cliche you can think of. I didn't continue to find the rest of them. It's as if the world-changing reign of John Paul the Great had never happened. I know it's only a thriller, but I just didn't buy the set-up, YMMV."
2,Nothing Electrifying about this Secret,"Father Michener is plagued with worry for his dear friend and mentor Pope Clement XV.Clement is concerned with a starling secret that is hidden in the archives of the Vatican. He then sends Michener on a trip to unravel the mystery of the third secret that the Virgin Mary has reveled to three youngstersGripping page turner? No, the only reason why I kept turning pages was because I was highly expecting a blow out a secret to end all secrets but once reveled I was sorely let downInsights on the Vatican was nothing more than the writers own opinion which makes this book a decent fiction read , one that you can take on a long airplane trip to pass away the timeblah"
3,Could have been MUCH better,"Like many of the reviews here, I feel the author blew it big time in the end. 8/10 of this book is very good, very entertaining and leading up to something big. But then...it happens...(spoilers) the author puts his political ideas (pro-abortion, pro-homosexuality, etc.) into the mouth of the Virgin Mary. I have little problem with the celibacy issue and female priest issue that he also advocates, but even that does not allow this book to wrap up on a positive note.A great book with a cartoon ending, that ultimately means it is a not so great book. If you like Vatican intrigue read 'Angels and Demons' or an actual history book....leave this one alone."
2,The Third Secret: A Novel of (not that much) suspense,"The Third Secret is another entry in the Vatican intrigue genre. It has the usual elements: Vatican conservatives the usual bad guys vs liberal Catholics the usual good guys. The ""Third Secret"" refers to secret revelations given to Marian visionaries at such places as Fatima and Medjugorge, the existence of which is historical fact. If there is any suspense in the novel, it is not with the plot which is remarkably predictable and derivative. The only thing that kept my interest was waiting to find out the actual content of the third secret(s), at least according to the novel's author. In the end, these proved to be rather predictable too, given the author's religious inclinations."
2,Weak Work In The Style Of Angels & Demons Or The Da Vinci Code,"How many stories can intrigue in Catholic Church spawn?Berry tries to imitate Dan Brown (which is also, admittedly, his own basic style) but he really falls flat with this work.Stock characters: a moderate dying pope, a somewhat secret liberal investigating priest, a conservative Catholic powerful priest/villan who is willing to murder to achieve his aims.It all culminates in a real religious ""truth"" that shows that the powerful interests in the Church have really been working against the true will of God (in this case through various Marian appearances) for decades.Not to be a spoiler, but the ultimate ""secret"" wasn't all that exciting either. My own personal views are pretty much in line with Berry's so this is far from a political statement. It just wasn't that much from a thriller perspective.This one can be given a pass. The lackluster plot sinks this one."
2,Author: do homework,"It is difficult to understand why this book has been rated so highly.The place where the Pope spends the Summer is spelled incorrectly throughout. Author: write 100 times ""Castel Gandolfo"" (in the book: ""Castle Gandolfo"")."
3,Homosexuality and abortion are OK.,"Yep that's it, The Third Secret. Oh yeah, throw in the slightly less controversial ideas that priests should be allowed to marry and woman should be ordained, and you've got the whole story. No need to read any further.Why three stars? Because for the first 300 pages this is a better than average thriller. There isn't anything new here, as several other recent books have explored the machinations of the Vatican and papal selection process, but Berry has crafted a tight story with (almost) believable characters.If you're a member of NARAL or NAMBLA, you'll thoroughly enjoy this romp of Catholic bashing.For the reast, try Berry's ""Ambler"" or ""Romanov"" novels; much better and far less offensive."
3,Ok buy it if u really want to.,"Ok. Just where do I start?It seems that the way to sell books these days is to stir enough controversy and hope that the publicity sells it. It used to be political conspiracy theories, these days you take a swipe at major religions of the world.The above is what stopping me from giving anything higher then a 3/5. I admit I enjoyed the cat & mouse game, though not as thrilling as the first time you read the Da Vinci Code. Of the three Mr Berry's books I read, this one I managed to stop the urge to read the last few chapters to find out what the ho-ha is all about.The 'conspiracy' topic seemed rather dated, not too ground breaking (I'm not telling here just in case you do want to get it yourself).In any case, if you need something to buy at the airport bookshop, and need to hold and read something, well... it's ok. You might however finish reading it after you arrived at your hotel."
2,fatima,the author uses a great inspiring event to sneak in at the end of his story his personal perverted idea of morality..this book iwould describe as a piece of garbage..i assinged my copy to the garbage disposal where it belongs....
1,Terrible Book,"This book is contrived, poorly written, and far-fetched. It casts Church conservatives as evil and diabolical men trying to thwart the will of God by hiding and/or destroying the revelations from Fatima and Medjugorie. It turns out that the 'revelations' are based on God's dissatisfaction with Church doctrine in areas that liberals are always whiny about.(...)So the repeated appearances of the Virgin Mary were due to her anger that the Church opposed homosexual marriage, abortion, female priests, and allowing priests to marry and have families. How lame and predictable. (...)"
2,Disappointing.,A good book constantly makes you wonder what is going to happen next. It makes you care about the characters. It stirs emotion. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It makes you want to go back to it and keep reading.The Third Secret does none of these.
2,the third secret,"I enjoyed berry's novel,The Amber Room, and thought this would be worth reading. It wasn't!! The plot was well done,but when it came to the revelation of the ""secret"", I moaned and wanted to toss the book across the room. What a letdown!! I literally laughed out loud and thought just another liberal minded person wrote this book. Very disappointing"
4,My review,I am a big Steve Berry fan and have read all of his books. This one is controversial and makes you think about thesubject. Very well written and I look forward to reading his future books.
5,Great read!,This Berry book is a wonderful adventure...easy and exciting...as are all his books. He starts slow...puts in the detail that keeps you engrossed.
4,Blending Action and Reflection,"A great blend of page-turning thriller-action and thoughtful reflection on the state and history of the Catholic church. The craze for books like The Da Vinci Code has mostly died down, but this novel reminded me of why I jumped on that bandwagon in the first place. There is just enough there to make me stop and think about my own faith and beliefs and to keep me engaged with that aspect of the tale, and there is just enough action to keep me turning pages. The writing is sound enough that I truly cared about what was happening, not just for myself but for the characters involved. Really, Berry is a master of that blend, and I especially enjoyed the challenge to reflect in the context of the novel's action."
1,An Insult to all Christians,"I read this book thinking that the author may have some good insight into what the famous ""Third Secret"" of Fatima is, especially in view of today's world. Instead he wrote a book that ended up insulting Christians, Catholics in particular. I was shocked when he finally gets to the end of the book and suggests the Mary was sending messages from heaven implying that God is upset because there is not enough acceptance of abortion ,homosexualitry, promiscuity, you name it. Steve Barry has totally lost it. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Way too much Catholicism,I liked The Amber Room and LOVED The Romanov Prophecy. I was prepared for another terrific book. What a disappointment. This book is far more a fictional in-depth look at the selection of a Pope than a mystery thriller. I found it too far-fetched to be remotely believable.The flyleaf says Steve Berry is at work on his next book. Let's hope it's better than this one.
1,One of the worst six sigma reference,This is one of the worst written six sigma book I have read. It has neither depth or clarityThere are also many mistakes in the book. The formatting is also badly done. It is a poor effort and I am shock that this book is associated with ASQ.
3,great aim,"I think that this book was not too bad, and is worth the buy, but it could be improved. Content wise it was not so bad, but it was the layout and presentation (amateur photographs) with heavily packed text. It looks like a scrapbook a child would throw together - and this may not necessarily be a bad thing considering the audience is children. I was really up in the air rating this one and would have given it a 4 if the organization was a bit cleaner. It deserves a 5 if it was organized a bit better ""and"" images were professional throughout - so you can see why I am saying it is worth a buy.If your child has an interest in becoming a vet this is a recommendable book, along with others, and let them decide if the content within is worth a visit."
2,Broken after a few uses,"Filter is a little narrow, but it worked fine until I unscrewed it during the third use. Perhaps I overtighted it, but it was a little hard to unscrew from the lens. When it finally came off, the two glass pieces separated. Unfortunately I wasn't able to reassemble the two pieces, so I tossed them in the trash and thought to myself, ""That's what I get for [...]."""
1,no!!!!,"iguess you have to be stoned to enjoy this moviebecause any other way its just bad its just not interesting ,not funny, not worth it"
3,Older Works Better! This Is Too Sticky!,This newer version of leave in treatment left my hair feeling stiff and sticky. I'm trying to get away from weighted down hair and get that natural soft feeling without it. I've found that just a small amount of cheap ole regular rinse out conditioner actually works better. Just rub small amount in palms and distribute evenly through hair ends.
1,Extreme Disappointment,Don't purchase one of these - their are better options at Amazon.The first one (which was shipped very promptly) refused to accept a charge after a day or so. While Amazon sent a replacement as soon as I reported the problem the second one has now stopped accepting a charge after three weeks.The service (as always) from Amazon has been great but needless to say this particular batch of batteries has some inherent problems so look at the alternative brands available at amazon.
3,Just ok,"I would have to agree with another review that said this movie was disappointing. Indeed much of it seemed pointless. To me this was a movie that had a lot of potential, but never really explored that potential. To explain more would take a while and give away spoilers, suffice to say you're not missing anything here. If you're a fan of ji-hyun jun then maybe see it just for her, but that's about it."
4,A wonderful book for pilots and dreamers alike,"Richard Bach describes the marvel of flight so well in his easily-digested shorts about airplanes, personal journeys, and philosophy. I almost don't need the book anymore- several of the stories are so easily recalled, not for their context of wings and propellers and runways, but for the enthusiastic care for freedom and self-determination that Bach extends to the reader."
4,Tivo is much better than your cable company's DVR,"Tivo is a great service and well worth the extra costs compared to the cable or satellite company DVR. It works well, is reliable, and will truly change the way you watch tv. The downside to all this is that most Tivo boxes (except for the expensive Series3) all rely on analog cable connections. This will be a problem in the future, as cable companies move away from analog systems and to digital systems. (Of course, there are work-arounds, but they aren't very elegant or cost effective). As long as you know this limitation, and that the future of the Tivo Series2 is limited - it's the best thing since sliced bread and well worth every penny!"
5,Must-have item,Whatever did I do before my TiVo?? This product has performed as promised. No sweat with the set-up and veddy-veddy user-friendly!! I highly recommend it to anyone.
4,Love my Tivo!,"Learned of Tivo and how it works at my brother's house. I love mine, but I guess due to it's age it is now sticking and often I have to unplug it to get it going again. Also, it is changing channels by itself now at times. Overall, though, I love it."
1,TiVo TCD49080 Series2,"This model TiVo is out of date. It will only record Digital and Analog programs and NOT Hi Def. You must have a Multi-Channel tuner card installed in order to receive cable TV channels -- this costs $1.50/month plus a $20.00 installation charge from Comcast -- plus the monthly charge from TiVo is $12.95 (as I recall) -- this is an EXPENSIVE proposition.I'm returning the TiVo because Comcast offers their Hi Def DVR for $9.95 for 6 moths, then $12.95 there after.Oh did I mention that if you have Vonage or cable telephone service that you MUST buy a wireless adapter for ~$50.00?This is not only an outdated piece of equipment, but a very expensive solution to recording TV programs/movies!"
2,Dual Tunner noooo,Tivo is a big rip-off. I purchased a TiVo TCD649080 Series2 80-Hour Dual-Tuner on line and hooked it up for 1 month at $9.95 and after a week I found it could only record 1 channel at a time so I called and canceled it. So for that one-week they charged me $109.50 and said it was an early termination fee. Even the Cable Company is not that bad beware of the moneygrubbers. Get you DVR from your cable or sat provider their Dual tuners are real dual tuners not pretend tuners.
3,"Great information, poorly written.","Military historians are notorious for being poor writers; they seem to have a quota on the amount of howevers, moreovers and indeeds they must put into a book. This reference sets the bar, I scanned the book to my computer and did a count of the historians use of the words however, moreover and indeed; 322 howevers, 297 moreovers, and 244 indeeds.The writer had one more extremely annoying habit, for some reason he loves to use the phrase ""none other than."" For example the pilot was none other than the squadron commander; or the passenger was none other than the president.The book is very difficult to read because of the writers frequent use of writer's crutches. If the reader can ignore that, this book is still quite interesting."
1,Piece Of Poo!!!,"This is the worst cd i have ever heard. If you like no hooks and, emotionless dribble then this is the record for you. was this recorded through an A.M. radio? I wouldn't give this cd to my worst enemy.THIS SUCKS!!! I want my money back!!!"
1,boring,If you like this album you will probably like any other mediocre band out there now. It is the same recycled music over and over. Over singing and generic guitars make for a bland album. Just my opinion.
5,incredible cd,"i just picked this cd up on a whim today because i saw a good review of it on alternativeaddiction.com awhile back. This is alternative rock at its finest, some of the best i have heard in a long time. Highly reccomended"
1,GARGAGE,"Please. Save your money and don't buy this or any other book by Gail Howard. The entire premise of number combinations that are more likely to hit is bogus. It sounds good but its not real. Do some research online about statistics and probability. Each remaining ball has the same odds of being drawn. There is no skill to these types of lottery games-unlike say following the remaining scratch ticket prizes available for a certain game online and seeing what is the best buy. She has her success by people randomly winning with her book. Those that win are publicized. Those that don't are quietly forgotten. Seriously, youll win more money by taking the money you would have spent on this book and buying lottery tickets."
1,THE SAME SONGS,"THIS GUY IS SSOOOOOOOO WACK IT HURTS.....HE RECYCLES SO MANY LINES AND EVERY ALBUM OF HIS THAT YOU BUY HAS THREE TO FOUR DUPLICATE TRACKS FROM THE ALBUM BEFORE JUST WITH A DIFFERENT BEAT. ITS RIDICULOUS....WHAT ARE THEY PAYING HIM FOR. HE DOESN'T EVER COME WITH ANY NEW MATERIAL....HIS KKKILER FETUS ALBUM HAD NUMEROUS RECYCLED SONGS FROM THE CLOSED CASKET ALBUM AS DID THE GOTHAM CITY CD.....JUST LIKE THE HELLTER SKELLLTER ALBUM , AND ALL OF HIS SUBSIQUENT ALBUMS FOLLOWED SUIT....HOW ARE THESE PEOPLE GIVING HIM 5 STAR REVIEWS, I HAVE LOST ALL HOPE IN HIP HOP. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ORIGINALITY."
2,Disappointment,"This trip down memory lane did not work for me. What was funny when I was a child, now pretty much not at all. Fodder for Goodwill."
3,Billy Connolly - Live in New York (DVD),Product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. Not as funny as some of his previous work.
3,"No Subtitles necessary, NY","I own a set concluding all the disks mentioned separately of Billy Connolly's World Tour (New York,Billy Connolly - World Tour of Scotland [Region 2] and England, Australia and NZ).His perfect classic English pronunciation needs no subtitles also this DVD function is possible, jocks are funny as humour is understandable, and shows equipped with nice sightseeing of countries he was performing in."
4,Helpful in understanding dressage,Mueseler of the German School writes a useful text in understanding dressage & riding in general. It has long been a classic & should be considered a must-read.
3,Good tasting nutritional yeast with lots of folic acid reinforcement.,"This yeast tastes better than some. The product has high folic acid reinforcement, five times the recommended total daily allowance in each serving according to the product label as of late 2011. This extra folic acid might be a good thing, might be too much of a good thing, might be a bad thing, or might not make any difference to health. A popular-press medical negative alarm around the year 2010 over the issue of too much folic acid in the diet, or too high a RBC folate level in the blood, I'm not sure which, may have been misleading and both Dr. Kelly Robinson of California and Chris A., a health care professional of Maine say in the comments below, comments posted to an earlier version of this customer review, if I understand correctly, to not worry much if at all about negative health effects of high levels of folic acid in food."
3,"Well written, but way off the mark","I purchased this book just to see how the the Calvinists looked at Holiness, the baptism with the Holy Spirit. It is a shame how the enemy of our souls can deceive us into not believing what the Scriptures so plainly teaches. No one can be holy and retain any sin, to include our sin nature. I believe it was God who stated, ""be holy AS I AM HOLY,"" and BE PERFECT as your heavenly Father is perfect."" My dear friends, God is without sin, any sin. Be careful little heart what you believe.If I believed this type of theology, I would have probably given it 5 stars, it is well written, therefore three with my prayers."
3,Saw it on cable & was not inspired to buy it,I saw 2009's All Star show at it was hilarious. So much so I came to Amozon to buy it. This one I got bored so I did not even watch the whole thing. I'm not crazy about a lot of cursing but if your funny I can handle it better. I did not think Monique was funny just profane. Queens of Comedy was better material. Nonethelss- I say rent before buying.
3,everythang that looks good aint good 4 u.,"This dvd is live. Monique hosts the show and she is off the chain. She addresses Tiger woods situation, marriage, these groupies that try to get professional ball players in trouble and much more. She talks to individuals in the audience during the show like shaq, lisa lessley,Judge Mathis and stephen smith. Michael Blackson was the second funniest comedian. That strong ass AFRICAN accent. Corey Holcomb was aight. He thinks he too cool to tell jokes. Paul mooney had his liberal arts educated jokes that were only funny to people who had college degrees. All in all i recommend this dvd to anybody who likes stand up comedy."
5,Hilarious cynicism,"This is a ""laugh-out-loud"" funny book. Voltaire sounds very contemporary as he lashes out at everything foolish and stupid in the world. I can easily imagine Voltaire giggling hysterically as he wrote this one-and it comes through in this hilarious comedy. Not to be missed."
4,One-note concerto,"I loved this book the first time I read it in college. But after re-reading it, I've concluded that while Voltaire has a lot going on in this story, there is a simple formula directing the action: Candide meets some people. They do him wrong somehow. On the verge of death Candide escapes. Rinse, repeat.I still love reading the early chapters, they are comical masterpieces. I see Cunegonde in an entirely different light now than when I was younger. Candide and Pangloss are still naive morons, of course. And I have new found appreciation for Martin.Overall, Candide is great fun, but can get repetitious. Best read in one sitting."
5,Very good reading but certainly a work of a bad taste,"This book has two things which good book needs: first, it's a work of extremely talanted man, second, it's a book of a person with which you'll never agree. Voltaire was one who talked about bad taste of Shakespeare, but his taste is really extremely bad. When you begin to read this book, you think it to be a work of honest man, but in the middle of it you see that he was just a tricky politician. But it all just adds fun to the reading."
2,Even Proust isn&#65533;t this french.,"This is a french book. French books are, of course, often french, but this one is frencher than most. Ah, Pierrot! Reading this fine french book makes me the sad clown of life. Could Voltaire be any frencher, you ask? I doubt it. I am a sad clown, I say. Even when he criticizes the French he does so in a, how do you say, french way. Oui, oui! So come, bring along your Jerry Lewis video tapes and we will read this very french book together. It is frencher than a Quebecer at a Steisand concert. Frencher than Little Richard at an amfAR banquet. Frencher than Richard Simmons at a french pride parade. Read Candide and you too can be a very french sad clown. Sacre Bleu!!!"
3,"Good, but not great","I recently read Candide for a college history course and was not disappointed at all. I found it moved very well (spatially as well as dramatically) and the Voltaire's wit is everything is has been cracked up to be, not losing much to the passing of time. Overall, very enjoyable and reader fridenly. The only reason I didn't rate it higher than I did is that, due to its rapid movement of plot and action, Voltaire does not give us quite enough philosophical miles to the gallon. Too much of the novella is dedicated to the action and not enough to the thoughts and ideas of the characters involved."
2,A BAD ANIME,I can say that this a bad anime.the animation quality is average and the story is dull from start to finish.There isnt any heat or excitement and it doent have a real ending.
3,Too old,"It's made for the Macintosh. Unfortunately, the book isn't available as an updated version for the newest Adobe Professional. The examples are quite simple."
3,Varied offering with some great jams and tepid covers,"The Godfathers of Groove comprise Rueben Wilson (Hammond B-3organ), Bernard Purdie (the consummate session drummer), and Grant Green Jr. (guitars and the son of jazz legend, Grant Green), and Jerry Jemmott (bass guitar).When on their game, this ensemble sounds just as you hoped they wood: plenty of funky, jazzy grooves; a loose jazzy vibe; and reason to appreciate vintage JBL speakers. It doesn't matter whether the results are soul or jazz or something in-between.The original tracks are the strongest. It's hard to garner much interest, however, in yet another remake of Just My Imagination, and this one sounds polished but perfunctory. The other weakness, in my view, is that half the songs here do not hold up to repeated, focused listening, and the covers in particular sound too much like lounge music."
3,Vir-us?!,"Interesting read. King's ""The Stand"" for younger readers is the best way to sum this story up. It was somewhat a slow start, however, ends good.I feel there is no major character development going on in this book, however there are two more I've yet to read. The only two characters I really feel any strong emotions towards are Hunter and Angerman. Hunter is one of the main characters and seems to me pretty level headed. Angerman on the other hand is kind of creepy. I seriously hope is killed off in this series soon. He agitates me too much. Him doing so, however, proves to me that his character was well developed (seeing that I feel so strongly towards his demise).Overall a pretty good read."
4,A Rollicking Lusty Highlands Romance! I Loved It!,"This was my favorite Garwood book so far... I actually laughed during parts of it and truly enjoyed the story which I'd describe as a rollicking lusty Highlands adventure! The characters were well-developed. Since I'd already read The Secret, which was a book that preceded this tale, I loved reading a bit involving characters from that tale also ..."
4,This is one of her better stories in the past few years!,"The story line and characters were full of detail and charm. This book reminds me of her books prior to the ""Rose"" series. Both Brodrick and Ramsey were such strong characters in her previous book with Judity and Ian Maitland that I was glad to see ""their"" story. However, I felt Ramsey deserved his own book or more of this book to share his story. I feel his character and involvment could of been enhanced in greater detail and length. I liked the pace of the book, it kept moving throughout the story."
2,Mixed Up,"This book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth I don't understand why Bridig was even in the book, she was extremely irritating. Brodick was also another irritating character, I mean like some kind of wild caveman. I Liked Gillian and Ramsey and think they would have made a better couple. This is her first book where I think she overwrote the male lead. This is the first book I've read by JG that I wasn't crazy about but Gillian, Ramsey, Ian and Judith made up for the shortcoming with this one."
3,Ransom,"I'm a fan of Ms. Garwood, but please madame, try to enforce some shrewdness into your heroine's character. Gillian just irritated and upset me throughout the novel. She is described as having a strong character, but does nothing to emphasize this. I found her dense, very slow in the brain, and lacking, especially when the priest was marrying her to the hero (couldn't she get the hint that she was getting married, how stupid can a person be!) As for the hero, I must admit that for the setting of the story, he was described in such a way that did justice to his character as a Scottish laird, even if all he wanted to do was to get her in the sack."
3,Actually..3 1/2 stars.......,"""Ransom"" started out very strongly with a very well developed plot and likeable characters,however, I felt that once Gillian and Brodick met, the story fell flat....I believed this for a couple of reasons...the first reason being...All of the attention was focused on the development of the plot, but we were rushed into Gillian's and Brodick's relationship...for this reason, I didn't care overlymuch about the outcome of their love....But my main problem with this book was that we didnt really get to know Bridgid and Ramsey...I was so interested in them..I feel that they should have gotten their own book...all in all ..not a bad read...there were some definite perks..for instance, I adored Alec..he was so sweet...and I really enjoyed Bridgid with her myriad proposals.....This book had such promise, but there were just too many loose ends when it was all over and done with.....NOT Garwood's best."
4,Good story.... Just lacked a little,"So I love Julie Garwood. Her books are great, however this one is just good. I do feel that it lacked a bit of emotion between Brodick and Gillian. They don't meet until page 130! More info needed to be in there about Brigid and Ramsey, it would have made the ending have more of an impact! Anyways, it's still good and worth the read, just not as good as The Bride or Saving Grace! Just started reading Honor's Splendour."
2,TSTL Heroines ...,"I bought the new Kindle version of this book. Believe it or not, I just started reading Julie Garwood and have liked her work for the most part. I loved The Prize and The Bride. Lions Lady was okay. I did not like Ransom at all. The heroines both seemed weak to me and the heros were always in control and getting the better of the heroines. The heoines never stuck to their guns on any issue and there were several badly needed ""hero grovels"" scenes missing. Honestly, I didn't feel the love. Oh well. I'm thinking of trying the Secret just to fill in Judith and Ian's story, but I'm not sure I'm interested anymore."
5,THIS BOOK WAS WORTH THE WAIT!!!!!,"JULIE GARWOOD IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE ROMANCE WRITER. I'VE READ EVERYONE OF HER NOVELS (EXCEPT FOR HER ROSE SERIES)AND I WASN'T DISSAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE. THE HEROINE WAS STRONG, THE HERO WAS FUNNY AND TENDER, AND THE STORY LINE JUST CAPTURED MY ATTENTION. I READ THIS BOOK IN JUST 2 DAYS!!!! I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN IT CAME OUT AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO LOVE TO READ GREAT ROMANTIC STORIES TO GET RANSOM!!! I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEW BOOK TO COME OUT!!!"
5,"An exciting, humorous, sweet romance full of fun!!!","All I have to say is if you are a true Julie Garwood fan you will go and get this book. I love and own all her books and this one did not disappoint. Reading it was like visiting old friends, happy to be there again laughing and crying, yet sad for the good time coming to an end. This book was so much fun to read. You should read ""The Secret"" first, and then read Ransom it will make the story that much more complete. My only regret is that I finished reading it so fast, but that's ok because now I can read it over again, this time slowly."
5,I Loved it!!!!,"This is definately one of my all time favorite books and... I have read a number of them. The plot, characters, and dialouge are well thought out and well developed. The book, Castles, comes before this in the series and it is also very enjoyable. If you haven't read this book, do so."
5,Ransom,"I've read every book Julie Garwood has written. I started in paperback and have watched her books go to hard cover. It's a testimony to how much I enjoy her books, that I can't ever just wait for the soft cover. I rush out and get the book the day it releases. Ransom lived up to all of my expectations. If they asked me to pay twice I would have. The characters are engaging and the dialogue is witty and intelligent. The romance is sweet and romantic in spite of the Buchanans reputation."
2,old and out of date,Was a good book in it's time but is out of date now.Don't waste your money. The up to date Black and Decker is probably great.
4,"A good performance, but there's better copies out there.","This copy of Scheherazade is technically perfect, which is a trait of the current New York Philharmonic. However, I think that the low brass could have been louder (especially during the important tuba part in the first movement). Movements 2 and 3 were really good, but there is some random coughing during crucial sections of these movements. The last movement was too slow during the fast sections and too fast during the slow sections (like the ending). However, Masur delivers the BEST Capriccio Espagnol I have ever heard. Movement 2 was lovely, and the solos were outstanding in movement 4. This copy has great sound quality, but it also muffles the low brass in Scheherazade. For a great Scheherazade, get the copy with Leonard Bernstein directing the New York Philharmonic. It's not perfect technically, but it has got it where it counts."
3,Stubborn Twig,"This was a gift to someone. I talked to the person that got it and she said it was ok, but she would have liked to read more about one particular family"
3,class,This book was required for a class at Eastern Oregon University and I ordered it for use in the class.
3,Beautiful but leaking white powder,"I bought this statue in 2006 from Amazon and I fell in love with it. It's a gorgeous statue. It looks like it's solid bronze, and it certainly cost enough ($148) but it must be only a bronze-like coating because, after about a year, a white powdery substance began to emanate from the crevices of the statue that requires daily wiping to keep it clean. I don't know how this statue was made or how to fix it, but evidently I can't throw a Buddha statue in the trash, or it's considered disrespectful. I wish I knew what was wrong with it."
1,don't recieve,"i buy this one with other four books on 11/12/2008.i still don't recieve this one now.but i have recieved other four books two weeks ago.by asking support why? they let me wait untill January 13, 2008.this is weird.i am in china"
1,waste of time and money,"This DVD is awful. I have never written a review, but after 5 minutes of this DVD I couldn't believe I wasted my money. Maybe a beginner might enjoy this, but certainly not someone who has exercised a day in their life. There is no need for all the breaks except to waste your time."
5,Good DVD,"I bought this DVD after reading all of the great reviews on Amazon as well as checking out Lisa's Youtube page. I enjoy Lisa's no nonsense approach to fitness and her body is amazing and you can't argue with that. I live too far away to meet with a kettlebell trainer I bought this as a beginner intro to kettlebell. I do not regret this purchase, the rests are a little long between sets but I fast forward if I am low on time or continue the exercise from the completed set.I am not a ""sweater"" but I do sweat with this DVD. I know there is room to grow with these fundamentals and I will eventually buy a heavier kettlebell. I am currently using a 20lb."
1,Worst kettlebell dvd out there,Don't waste your money. The only way to make this video a decent workout is to repeat each sequence by yourself during the 2 to 3 minute rest periods which follow each 1 minute of exercise. Terrible. Don't know who gave it five stars. Perhaps the friends of the instructor!
3,Good instruction,"This DVD is good production quality instructional video for very new beginners. No warm-up or cool-down. Good explanation of beginners versions of exersises, but pauses between sets are way to long to get a full benefits of KB workout. For workout purposes I like more Ami Bento videos. Hope next one video from Lisa shell be more workout oriented. If you are total beginner-this one contains a very detailed and visual explanations of form and exersises."
1,Another rip-off from the Asylum,"The Asylum has the reputation of putting out quickly produced rip-offs of major studio movies. Well they have gone across the Atlantic to ""borrow"" their next production. A Finish/German/Austrailian co-production called IRON SKY in which as a last ditch effort to save the 3rd Reich in the form of a base on the moon comes to fruition in 2018 when they return.The Asylum moved the new base to Antarctica and into the earth,added Josef Mengele,some flesh transplants and flesh eating bacteria bombs to this mess. I like some of the Asylum films because they are fun and SOMETIMES are pretty good. But after recently seeing IRON SKY this was painful to watch.The sets were pretty much non existant using warehouses for all the interiors( don't think a cinder block wall would be found inside a UFO).The only effects that worked were the air battles at the end and the ""machine"" Mengele is trying to get to work. This one is best LEFT at the center of the earth!"
5,One of the best books I have ever read!,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the qualities which made Jesus the most remembered, and loved leader in all of history. It is also a good tool to help anyone, in business, or just in life, sharpen their ability to become a great leader. I highly recomend this book to anyone searching for ways to live a happier and more lucrative life. GOD BLESS!!!!!!"
1,VIPER,"how can anyone with half a brain not see through this viper? not only is this book a farce, just look at him on tv, CLUE > he does NOT EVER SMILE, he just peers into the tv like some WWE Wrestler.another clue, he and his ""brethren"" are all peeps in the south, they believe just about anything.Matt 3:7But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, ""Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?Matt 12:34Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.Matt 23:33Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell?"
2,This is product is not a tutor,"I purchased this product after all the wonderful reviews. This product is not a tutor. It ask questions and gives a short explanation of the answer, if you click on 'Explanation'. This product offers no tutoring at all."
5,Must Read lesson in Faith and Courage,"This short book contains the story of Humberto Alexander's 22 years in Castro's prisons. It is a story of courage and faith under the ugliest of conditions. Alexander was shot, tortured repeatedly, starved, and treated in the most unspeakably inhuman ways, yet through it all his faith in Christ allows him and his fellow prisoners to survive and even to love those who were torturing them. You will not regret reading this book!"
1,waste of paper and money!,"As a list of what carts were made, it's ok. As a price guide this book is complete garbage. The prices it lists are guaranteed to get you laughed at and chased out of every video game store in America, if not the entire world."
4,solid,"I am very pleased with these levels. The price was great, they are light weight, easy to read and feel super solid. My only beef is that the aluminum sides leave black scuff marks, not a big deal on framing, but a real drag on a white painted cabinet!"
3,From Westrex,"Personally I was Dissapointed in this documentary about the strugle for Stalingrad . To me their was very little new footagethat I had not seen before , in fact it seemed to borrow itemsfrom earlier documentaries which I have seen many times . Forthe price and length of running times ,to me this had to be awinner and I thought this is going to be something very special ,but no , it felt flat . I should have just looked at some DVD'sI have on this subject and forgot this one ."
4,Detailed Hystorical war Documentary,I'm very impressed to view this emotional documentary about Stalingrad german's defeat. The movie's director take care for good images and interviews. Anyone have fun for war review must see it.
1,Professional issues in Speech Language Pathology,"I was extremely disappointed by Amazon. I needed this text book for a course and Amazon sent me the 2nd edition of the text; which is the older version; there is a 3rd edition out of this text.This is a terrible blunder by Amazon and it cost me undue stress and money since I now have to replace it with the newer edition, which I will purchase from my campus bookstore."
3,not up to stuff,"I was disappointed that the description isn't specific about the % down and % feathers, as was the tag on the pillow I had in a hotel. I wanted the same pillow, and I don't think I got it. This pillow is too firm for me. I liked the softness of the hotel pillow. I took a chance and ordered it anyway, but I think next time I'll just offer to buy the hotel pillow I like right on the spot, used and all."
5,A charming film about what happens when you start something.,"This is a wonderful, witty and often heartwrenching film. If you want to know how starting one thing can lead to finishing something else, watch Walters & Caine change each other for the better. A must see for any adult returning to college, if for no other reason than just to keep your morale up."
2,I would like to review it...,"but the seller (greenman19) took my money and I never received the item. Thus, I'm sure the movie is great, but I've still not seen it."
5,The big picture and the small picture,"Two warnings: First, the book is long. Second, the author is conservative and doesn't make an effort to hide it. If these facts don't disturb you then I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is a wonderful story of twentieth-century American politics, crammed with polls, stats, and insightful commentary. Why has ethnicity been a more important factor in politics than class? How did the political pendulum shift from conservatism to liberalism to conservatism again? Who are some of the most important statesmen in history that you've never heard of? And much, much more. If Michael Barone's ""The Almanac of American Politics"" is the Holy Bible of politics, then this work is a book of prayer."
4,Ho Hum,"This is a classic for sure but a classic of what? Most of the people Harrington writes about have created their own worlds and then populated them. Yes, we do feel sorry for the underprivileged but most people in America have the privilege of a free education, free libraries and free charity. If they fail, whose fault is it?"
3,Elite Performance -- Not a Very Good Recording,"I'll make this short & simple. I like the performance, but have a hard time getting past the sound. For some reason the violin sound is completely lacking in the high frequencies. The piano sounds fine, however. I suspect that there was a lot of spotlighting with the microphone placement, and that the violins were recorded too closely. Other recordings I have of various Mozart piano concertos are with Brendel/Marriner, Brendel/Mackerras, O'Conor/Mackerras, Uchida/Tate, Schiff/Vegh. I consider them all the be very fine performances. As far as sound goes, the Goode/Orpheus and Uchida/Tate are my least favorite recordings. The playing by the Orpheus CO is top notch."
3,Jim the Boy: A Review,"If only for the mere fact that I really enjoyed some of the more corky characters like Whitey and the Uncles, Jim the Boy was a bit of a snoozer. Although it was a fast read, I still wasn't connecting with the main character on any kind of level. A pretty good coming of age story, but Jim is no Holden Caulfield in my opinion.The lessons to be learned throughout the book are typical. Some scenes were very touching and well-written, but because I felt disconnected from Jim, I didn't emotionally react. This is a good book to read for leisure, but as far as teaching it to students, one might have a difficult time coming up with material that's fresh."
5,Simple writing that was anything but simple,"What a breath of fresh air - a book of deceptive simplicity that probes deeply into concepts like family loyalty, sacrifice and love. Without ever veering into the overly precious, the author conveys a sense of wonder at life's simple pleasures that we in modern times have all but lost. A distinctive authorial voice, and a life-affirming story that never sets off the Hallmark/Chicken Soup alarm. Nicely done."
5,You will love it,I liked this book a lot. I liked the drawings and the words. I learned alot about nature. I'm glad my mom bought this book for me. Someday I want to work in the outdoors.
5,"A ""Must-Have""!!!","WOW! This book deals beautifully with what was a very painful and tragic day for all of us... and it is a must-have for ALL Americans, for ALL time! The imagery is awesome and sometimes disturbing... but we should be disturbed, and we should NEVER forget! To forget the day... is to forget the huge loss of life. This book not only immortalizes the significance of the events of September 11th, but it immortalizes those who were lost and those who lost, those who were heroes and those who continue heroic efforts on a daily basis. LIFE has done a great job of balancing the tragedy of that day, with the hope for the future. So... as we move forward... and you begin to slip back into a sense of complacency... open this book... look at the pictures and read the words... and I am sure that it will once again seal your resolve to treasure every moment and to continue striving to make the world a better place."
1,Uninformative,"The events of 9-11 are still unfolding 8 years later. Scientists from BYU and the University of Copenhagen have recently completed a well-researched and comprehensive analysis of nano-thermite found within numerous samples taken on and shortly after 9-11. NIST only recently completed their investigation of Building 7, and concluded that fire, alone, caused this 47-story building to freefall (in the exact same manner as an engineered implosion) at 5:20 pm on 9-11. NIST refuses to analyze samples for explosive materials (even after the recent confirmation of presence at the scene of this horrific crime). This book, like the media, does not include these uncomfortable facts...but these facts must be known by every caring citizen of this Nation. Our future depends upon the public taking the time to educate themselves."
5,Interesting history,"As is always the case with Beard's work, I found it very interesting and thorough."
4,one of the top comics in the world,He is so talented and expressive with his face. I love his humor that is relatively clean but so dead on true.
3,Wrong product received,"The Cosmic Pet Double Wide Scratcher is the best product on the market for cats that love to stratch. However, I did not receive the item ordered. I received 4 regular scratchers with no top. Disappointed."
2,I SADLY MUST SAY THAT THIS IS BORING....,"I'm a huge fan of Kai Hansen. I also like very much some recent works by German powermetal bands ( ""EXCALIBUR"" by Grave Digger and ""NIGHTFALL ON MIDDLE EARTH"" by BLind Guardian, for example ). But Kai Hansen appearance in IRON SAVIOR is almos as guest, since Pit Sielck writes all the songs, sings, plays guitar, bass and keyboards !!! The result is an album in which you clearly see the musicians skills, but where every song sounds the same: a furious metal assault with melodic choruses in between. After the first listening, the CD will be stuck into you collection pile for a long time ..."
5,Best Text for Learning Communication Skills,"I am an instructor for a local college. I selected the Essntials of Business Communication as the textbook for my Business Communications course after working with it in a previous class. It is the best organized text I have found with step by step instructions for students to readily grasp the techniques used in modern business documents. The book covers e-mails, memos, a variety of business letters, reports, business proposals, resumes, letters of application and communication skills for oral presentations and interviews. Lectures, examples, assignments, and grammatical challenges are pre-designed for the instructor's use, making this a turn-key system for teaching communication skills."
2,Learning to Program with Visual Basic,I had to buy this book for a class and frankly it is not a good book. Lots of code errors that make it confusing. Every one of my classmates complained about the book. The professor eventually told us to not use the book and he gave handouts he had written instead.
1,Horrible ending,"I was totally enthralled by this entire series, even the Sherlock Holmes style story of Stonecutter but this ending was horrible. Took a perfectly good sword and sorcery series and turned it sci-fi. I'll read sci-fi when I want that, I read this series for magic and swordplay. I'd read the entire series again and simply leave this one out."
2,THE text on advanced calculus at my school,"I can't believe this is the book my advanced calc 1 class used at university. They sold it to me for $114.50+tax! This is a deal here. This class was the hardest class I took for undergrad. The book was no help. I learned everything I knew from the teacher and from the Internet/study groups. I do like how organized the book is, but the information was impossible for me to learn from the book."
5,the best scratcher,This is my 2d time I bought this replacement for my cat... She likes it so muuuuuch.... when I put catnip... it's awesome how she has a delight by enjoying to claw this kind of simple but effective thing.
5,A Testimony: Conversion to Screenplays,"This affectionate and humorous screenplay moves so quickly it may convert me to reading fewer novels, more screenplays. It is also a beautifully motivated piece and, in my opinion, Gompertz's best writing to date. What a lovely seasonal gift this will make--for yourself or a friend.----Reviewed by Carolyn Howard-Johnson, awardj-winning author of THIS IS THE PLACE, HARKENING and THE FRUGAL BOOK PROMOTER: HOW TO DO WHAT YOUR PUBLISHER WON'T, the winner of USA Book News Best Book of 2004, Professional Books Category."
5,A Must Read for Catholics and anyone interested in Christianity.,I had this book recommended to me by two people. I'm glad a listened. I enjoyed the read. It was easy to understand and very informative. The book clears up many misconceptions created by hearsay and the media. We Catholics are just as guilty as promoting these misconceptions therefore I considered it a must read. There is also a version available called Catholic and Christian for Teens.
4,Another book bought as a gift,"I bought my mother several crochet books and this is one of them. I don't crochet, so can't give too much guidance, but she liked it and I thought a lot of the patterns were nice."
2,Daughter of time,the book is very boring for my taste but its essential for what you may have to study for the class.
5,"Brilliant, Riveting","Anyone who loves a read about Tudor and Elizabethan times will not be able to put this book down. In it a 20th Century British detective laid up in the hospital solves the mystery of the disappearance of the Little Princes in the Tower. These were the two little boys, sons of the late King Edward IV, who were taken to the Tower of London for ""safekeeping,"" and never came out again. [And whose bodies were found hundreds of years later buried under a staircase in the Tower.] In the end the policeman comes up with the biggest expose in English history. And there is a twist on top of that. Irresistible."
3,Pretty good book,Liked the historical facts and the humour of the dialogue. Sometimes the connections between the various historical figures were hard to follow and the word definitions were difficult to figure out. It certainly made me very interested in Richard III
4,A great King.,"In view of the recent discovery in the Leicester car park, this book throws up some interesting theories about a maligned king. Worth a read."
5,Unique and interesting,"I love everything about this book. I love the pacing, the hilarious comments that you must read carefully to not skim over without catching the joke and the exploration of one of the most intriguing mysteries in English history. Well done!"
1,Poor quality,"I have only had them a week and already they are falling apart, I would not recommend them to anyone"
3,Silk PJ,The product is of decent quality but too over priced. It took quite some time to fill the order. Overall I will not be going back to that vendor and be more selective in the future.
2,RIP OFF-not what they seem,"When you first get these, you will realize that they are WAY BIGGER than they should be & assume they have made a mistake. But then, when you wash them, they will shrink into TINY kids looking clothes. I washed these in cold water, did not put in dryer, yet they shrunk about 4 to 5 sizes. I also washed in a gentle cycle, yet the seams look they are starting to fall apart and lint sticks all over them & they come out of the machine FULL OF WRINKLES..so basically after the first wash they are garbage...so unless you plan on having your PJ's dry cleaned, I wouldn't waste my money on these, they were cozy & comfortable at first (although when they arrive they will be WAY TO BIG) but once they make contact with water they are ruined (even though it says they can be machine washed & dried) I can't imagine if I had put them in the dryer, they would probably turn into doll clothes, save your money & buy the cheaper satin version, at leat they don't get ruined in the wash."
3,Good but for how long.,"My first impression of these was very good the silk is very nice and comfortable the only problem i have with them is how long will they last. After just one wash (in cold, gentile cycle) the small fibers started to come loose near the seems. I hate to see what they would look like after few washes. But I guess if you don't mind dry cleaning your PJs then go ahead."
1,Bad customer service and Cheap Printers,"We have had our printer for a little for over a year (also a bit over warranty, of course). We have had a paper feeding issue, so I spent two hours on a phone with someone from India trying to correct the problem. They eventually sent me a new one. Recently, we have had a problem with a big black line through our scanned images. Called again and since it was over a year, they would not help us. AAAH..I will not buy again."
3,"Prints well, poor paper feed","I got this for Christmas and didn't use it much until it was too late to return. The printing quality is terrific, but I get paper jams and/or no paper alerts every time I use it. I have to gently press the paper while it's printing but if it's slightly too hard it jams. What a headache. I use high quality HP paper but it doesn't matter.The online help is free but none of the stuff they said to do works consistently. I've unplugged wires and restarted and changed where the plugs is and everything. It will work while I'm talking to the tech support for that time and then mess up.I expected HP to have a high quality product and I like everything else about it but this tender care to every page I print is horrendous."
1,SMASHED,"I had all the same paper feed, paper jam, customer service problems just like everyone else. I fixed the problem by smashing the printer into my wall. Of course I had to pick up thousands of glass shards and buy some drywall mud, but I feel much better!"
1,"Paper jams, bloated driver, shutdowns","To begin, the software installation is a headache. I had trouble installing it even though I work in IT. Why do you need a 40MB - 200MB driver that requires you to turn off your Anti-virus during installation?! The printer jams often and will sometimes shutdown while printing. While I think HP business grade printers are great, this consumer grade printer is junk."
1,Worst Printer Ever,I signed up just to write this review. I have had printers from Canon Epson Lexmark and Hp in the last 10 years. I have to say that this printer is the worst of the lost.I have had all of the feed issues that others have had and more.My printer cleaned itself so often that the sponge under the ink cartridges actually turned into a mountain. The ink is insanley expensive and does not last long at all. The software is bloated and like others the scanner software just stopped working.I will never buy another HP printer again.
1,The worst !!,"I'm so glad to see others corroborate my experience with this meshuggah printer !Nothing but trouble - paper jams all the time, slow, awful - I thought it was maybe because I was using a Mac but apparently not.STAY AWAY at ANY price !"
1,Causes Reboot Delay...,"The system works great and the clarity is perfect. The problem is when I reboot the computer, it takes 10 minutes. I just get a single flashing dot in the top left corner for 10 solid minutes and then it will finally boot up. If I unhook the printer, the system boots up normally... HELP!!!"
1,HORRIBLE customer support,"Like everyone else, I had the paper feed problem. However, what's really awful is the customer support. I service rep in India took the call, and while I knew exactly what the problem was, it was like talking to a robot. All the rep could do was follow exactly what his script said, then he transferred me to someone else who asked the same exact questions all over again.HP was so gung-ho about offshoring all of their customer service. Well, since I can no longer GET any competent service I certainly won't be an HP customer again."
1,Horrible Scans,I picked up this device to replace a ten year old HP Deskjet & a Canon scanner.It didn't print as well as the old Deskjet & the picture scans were horrible with lines in the image & it didn't seem to have enough gray levels as b/w pictures were clipped
1,HP isn't getting any more chances this time...,"I originally bought the printer in November '05, and it worked splendidly for about three weeks, at which point I had it replaced because, as has happened to so many other people, the printer started refusing to take the paper in the tray out of the blue one day.I got the replacement, unpacked it, and it worked beautifully again. As I was away from my apartment during the Christmas season, it didn't see much use during the return period, and didn't stop feeding paper again until I (finally) threw the box away three days ago.I'd never buy a computer from HP, but I thought, ""It's just a printer, and what are the chances of the same thing going wrong twice?"" Pretty good, apparently."
1,You've done nothing to deserve this,"No piece of hardware should be as painful to use as this was. Not a bad printer when it worked -- but between the expiring ink cartridge issue, which a web search will tell you more about, functions that were dead on arrival, flaky tech support, paper feed issues, expensive ink, bloated hardware, and a scan/copy button that did nothing, it didn't work often enough. It does have an ethernet port, but there's no point in networking a printer that doesn't print. Also, if you get stuck with vague cartridge errors, removing one of the two ink cartridges may be a work around. Not acceptable performance, though.This printer's about to go the way of Old Yeller, and be replaced with something that actually prints."
2,Wrong Region,"Not really sure how the whole region thing works, or which region I live in. It's obviously not region 2, because this disc, although in great condition, refuses to play in any dvd player around. Will be returning it if possible. Shipping time was excellent though, it arrived two weeks ahead of the expected arrival date."
1,Who Framed Rogerll Rabbit - REGION 2,I can't believe Amazon actually shipped this product to someone living of MAssachusetts seeing it was for Region 2 which I had no idea what that was. We found out when we tried to play it and it wouldn't play. It cost $12+ and by the time all the charges were taken off we only got a $3+ credit when we returned it.
1,Bad movie,"When i received the movie, it wouldnt play in any of the dvd players that we have in the house,,i think the movie was a fake!!!!"
3,actually the first DVD was censored,"there were a couple of quick digital edits Disney made to Roger Rabbit, when they first released it on DVD. check the cut list at [web address]for complete information on these edits, and hope that they restore Zemeckis's original vision for this release!(I checked 3 stars only because some stars have to be given. If it is the original cut, make that 5 stars)"
5,I love it .,"This movie produce in year 1988 , it was very good movie then , but when I witch it again now , I love it more and more than before ."
1,This is a disgrace to DVDs,"There could have been so many extras here, and we get nothing. When the movie aired on network television, it put in entire sequences that made the cutting room floor, including the weasels painting a pig head on Eddie. Not only do they not give us the cut scenes, but I would have also liked to see some ""making of"" features or maybe some commentary. Anything! This movie deserves better."
1,DVD doesn't work,"The DVD came rattling in the box. When I tried to get the DVD to play my DVD player it said, "" wrong region."" I'm not sure what this meant???. All my other DVDs work just fine."
4,I liked it.,"Being a kid, I probably shouldn't have seen this movie, but it was awesome! The cartoon elements are cool, and Bob Hoskins makes for a great show. My parents hate this movie because of all the language, but I thought it was great! Definately a must-see if you love cartoon/live action movies. No wonder it won a ton of Oscars!"
3,who indeed?,"this is a ground breaking cartoon/film.basicly,roger rabbit,a cartoon rabit,is married to jessica whose a cartoon human.shes a real hussy and plays patty cake with another man.i think hes a real person.then that guy gets whacked.so,this drunken detective goes out searching for who framed roger rabbit.it IS designed for kids,however there are a few things to watch out for such as strong language and rogers wife who makes my toes curl and i know shes only animated.the detective gets drunk as often as possible too.it is the very first movie where animated and real life characters interact.overprotective parents beware!"
5,Who Framed Roger Rabbit?,wonderful mix of animation and real time actors. Harkens to old MGM days when Jerry the Mouse danced with Gene Kelly. Bob Hoskins is great in the detective role.
1,Featureless DVD,This DVD is a very weak release of a terrific movie. There are no bonus features -- including scenes once broadcast on network television -- and Disney went back and changed some of the animation to sanitize it. Here's a big thumbs down and I hope they re-release it with the original animation and with enough features to make the DVD worth the price.
4,The problem at the end of the movie,"At the end of the movie, their is the Roger Rabbit short Tummy Trouble (Amazon.com sells the other two shorts on VHS) I noticed that the entire cartoon was discolored slightly. If this is what ""Digital Restoration"" is than I want no part of it. They take the crisp, sharp colors and dull them down! does this make any sence?"
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought one of these after my second Sonic Care died within a year. The toothbrush does not clean quite as well as a Sonic Care but it is much better than a manual toothbrush. You don't need to spend the kind of money they are offering them for here however. Found mine at a ""big box"" for a lot less money. You might also want to consider an Oral B sonic for about $24 at a big box."
1,OMG this is so awful,"how can you people listen to this? this is so awful. i can't stand this... abomination. the pace is so gruelingly slow. i dont mind slow songs every now and then, but jesus, this is slower than slow. these guys give a new meaning to the word slow. it may be a little bit more listenable if they picked up the pace just a little bit. but its so slow, how can they even play that slow, its so mindnumbing, i cant stand it, it drives me insane. its so dark, and its also frightening. i just cannot listen to it. the only reason i checked this horrific disc out is because it got such rave reviews. call me what you will, but i would not recomend this to anybody. i cannot see how anybody could like this. its so awful."
3,Completely misses the hardest part of going to Mars,"Which of course is politics.The technology to go to Mars has existed since the 1970s. What no longer exists is the political will to do so.When I was a teenager growing up in the 1960s most everyone was ""space happy"". We all assumed permanent bases on the moon and a manned landing on Mars within 10 years.Today we have no U.S. manned space program, no way for us to get into space. Sure, decades from now there MAY be a robust private space-travel industry. But that is a long time. In the interim, space will be owned by Russia and China.When John F. Kennedy pledged to go to the moon, he meant it. He had an intense personal commitment to the enterprise. He delivered speeches remembered to this day. He dedicated astronomical sums to make it happen.What should our space program be like? Search the Internet for ""Man conquers space"" and watch the trailers."
3,The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the old testament,"This Lexicon is way above my paygrade, to hard to use. I'm sure people with PhD's get it. I will have to look for an easier book to use."
5,My all time favorite movie,"This is my all time favorite movie. I Know most people don't like it. But I don't understand why it has to be like the game. What kind of movie would this be, if it was? Come on it would be two guys running around jumping on Gumba's heads. Not saying I have anything aganist the games. They're fun and challenging. And who couldn't love Spike and Iggy and don't forget Yoshi. All you people who hated , it's your fault we don't have sequel! It will always be the best movie."
3,An OK cheesy video game movie.,"This was passable entertainment, nothing more. It is not as bad as people make it out to be, and it is certainly better than most horrible movies i've seen. The two leads have good chemistry which works, and Dennis Hopper does an OK job playing Koopa. The script is campy, and the lines given by the two guys in the cab is plain dumb. Just watch this movie once, or twice, but it does the video game it's justice."
2,Super Mario Bros The Movie,"Hello People, I am going to be reviewing a Movie that ruined my school reputation.... The Movie itself is OK....These famous actors who are chosen to play mario and luigi are acting in this movie, OK.. So I was in first grade when I watched this on VHS, and then my best friend Louis who was sitting next to me at story time was talking to me and then this picture from the movie came in to my mind and I told him ""Let's be bad!"" From that day in first grade I would always go to the pricipals office and never complete assignments. That is why I would NOT recommend this movie for anyone under the age of 10, if you are 10, please have an adult with you so you don't get any ideas.Huge Mario Bros fan that is above 10... OK you can watch it, if you are age 9 or below please steer clear of this title.Please get this movie if you are above the age of ten!J.R. Platt"
2,Mario and Luigi on the big screen..not so good,putting Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as the plumber brothers Mario and Luigi. Samantha Mathis is Princess Peach and Dennis Hopper is the boring King Bowser. some good moments here and there but whats the deal yo. the games are better then this monstrousity. damnit...they should of made a cartoon version. Leguizamo and Hoskins are ok as the brothers but wow.....not good and the Yoshi dinosaur is idiotic
2,pitiful,"If you ask me, any movie that is based on a video game and they don't have similar story lines is a lame attempt at a movie. Lets take a look at the games, it doesn't take place in a city, iggy and spike are dinosaurs, Yoshi is not a pet to koopa, koopa's are turtle like creatures, Luigi has a moustache, and the maidens name is peach. In the movie, Mario and Luigi have to jump by using air stompers, the maiden's name is Daisy, Goomba's are humanoid in appearance, Koopa Troopa's drive around in cars, and there is no Bowser, just Koopa. I could go on for hours, but if you are a Mario fan, don't see this movie, STAY AWAY!!!"
5,Love it,So glad I actually found it! Remember seeing it when I was little but no one else seems to have seen it. Now I have proof! And some 90s flashbacks haha
3,Brings Back Old Memories. . .,"This is one of my son's favorite movies from his childhood. He has looked for it for ages and Amazon not only had it in stock but also at a great price. It may be a bit silly and goofy, but it brings back fun memories and was a great surprise stocking stuffer."
1,The 90's,"You may have used the arguement that this movie was released in the 90's, 93 to be exact, and that cgi wasn't developed yet. But, Jurassic Park came out that same year, didn't use cgi, and it didn't look like crap. Did the producers just not care? Explain that. Stop trying to mkae reasons whythis movie is good, because it just isn't."
3,awsome,i've also seen this movie on disney. it's weird because the caractors look and act different. like mario is bald and luigi is younger. but most of all what i thought was weird was that luigi falls in love with a dinosuar princess...
3,$,Little twig powder has a better rating from Envirornmental Working Group. I like to put this on babys creases in summer.
5,TGN 3,"When I first heard this CD, I loved it from the get go. The music is very hypnotic, while at the same time it infuses you with a lightening bolt of high powered trance trip'n. This makes an excellent medium for visualization (the internal kind, not the video kind), meditation, and just trancing out. Oh yeah, and dance. Dance, dance, and dance to this badboy. Even at 56 years old, I can feel the electric current going through me like I was made of copper. Did I mention it's downright sensuous too...oooeee baby, it sure'nuff is."
4,Great Starting Place!,"This book is a great starting place for building a happier and fuller life. I particularly enjoy the idea of taking charge of my own life. What it didn't seem to give me was a hands on system for creating my success.If you like this book, you love ""I'm Rich Byond My Wildest Dreams. I am. I am. I am."" By Thomas L. Pauley and Penelope Pauley. It did give me that step-by-step system I was looking for."
2,Not the best,"I am an avid reader so when I had an assignment in my Psychology class I was excited to see what there was to offer on Erik Erikson. I read the reviews on this book and it was promising. I bought it from Amazon.com and it came quickly, quicker then it said it would. I got through the first chapter all right but then things just went downhill. It was boring, I found it not to be well written. I normally enjoy reading about his theories and studies but this was not a great book. I would not recommend this book."
2,Dissappoinment,"So was the movie chilling or frightening? The answer is no. I didn't like the movie at all. I may have seen the Exorcist too many times but I think that the movie wasn't scary enough to keep me satisfied. It wasn't a surprise that I was dissappointed after seeing it. It's absolutely not a horror movie only a good psychic thriller. I think that the fault is all Ira Levin's and his original book. Well, he has never been my favourite writer. Of course Roman Polanski is a good film director and Rosemary's Baby were a nice sightseeing into New York in the 60's. But it offered me nothing else."
2,Be careful.....,"I bought this movie because I heard and read good things about it. Maybe these reviews were all written in the 60s who knows. Personally, this movie is overrated and the ending is just awful. I gave 2 stars for the simple reason that Mia Farrow is stunning."
1,could not see it...,"yet i guess the movie must be great, i did not see that this dvd is only for certain countries n doesnt play here in the States.. so that kinda sucks money down the drain...."
2,So....,"I do not know why this is a classic horror. It's pretty stupid. The characters are vacuous, the plot line is clice""d, the ending was retarded."
5,The best supsense movie,"I saw this movie over a dozen times & enjoy it everytime. Some viewers confuse this movie as a HORROR movie, & they expect to see blood & massacre on screen. But this is certainly not Polanski style. This one keeps you in suspense until the end of the movie. If you have read the book, you appreciate how Polanski directed the movie true to the essence of the novel. The dream sequence is exactly how IRA LEVIN wrote in his book & Polanski did a good job. There are too many young audiences nowadays only look for 'blood & terror' in movies & don't appreciate such a fine film. They better off just watch the cheap flicks...."
5,Movia...please....,"This movie is a masterpiece of terror & suspence & Beautifully filmed & acted.Comparisons to reality are not ""allowed"" when reviewing films of this caliber. Your reaction(though it MAY be sarcastic) is EXACT proof of it's genius! Watch it again...and this time....bask in all it's glory!"
5,"""They use blood in their ritual's, and the blood that has the most power is baby's blood.""","Rosemary's Baby is satanic good fun. This is one of the most impressive horror film's I've ever seen in my life and may be my favorite horror movie of all time. Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is extremely ahead of it's time with the use of strange dream sequences, experimental cinematography and truely disturbing subject matter. Mia Farrow's performance is amazing to say the least and she has cemented her role as one of my favorite actesses of all time. Not much blood or gore in this movie but focuses on it's acting and satanic vibe to scare viewers......and it does! This is an amazing movie I recommend to anyone who has not seen it, GO BUY IT NOW!"
1,The most overrated movie I have ever seen.,"Maybe I am just too young to get it, but it was not scary, not clever, and just not good.I watched the movie anticipating that it had to end well, but the ending made the movie worse.This is my first review. I just had to speak out against this movie."
1,This is a classic??,"I had heard this was one of the best horror movies of all time, but my experience was that it was one of the most ridiculous and worst movies I had ever seen. I'd steer clear of this lemon. Ugh!"
1,Yuck!,"Rosemary's Baby starring Mia Farrow is a total disaster. The ending is cheesy, what was Roman Polanski thinking? This horror flick is considered a classic but I think it's a muddled mess. Stay away from this turkey."
1,One of the worst ever.,"This stands out in my mind as one of the biggest wastes of time I ever spent watching a movie. The name of the movie is Rosemary's Baby, the whole movie centers around awaiting the birth of the baby, and after all is said and done, we spend a lot of time being bored and not seeing the baby. Total rip-off. Save your time and money. This movie is complete garbage, regardless of the decent acting."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box. First, the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy, and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back. There was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance. Finally, it is just not good looking at all...extremely cheap in appearance. It did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to Amazon. I went with the Bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers. Evidently, another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!! Get the Braun KF550-BK AromaDeluxe instead!"
2,Wouldn't buy again,"We bought this coffeemaker to replace a Melitta. This unit is much taller, barely fits under the cabinets in our kitchen. The carafe is a strange design, have to turn it almost upside down to get all the liquid out. The device that forces water through the filter is narrow, so when I tried to use my re-usable filter, most of the coffee did not even get wet and made a poor pot of coffee; you have to use a paper filter. The dripper drips every time you take the pot off, even though it has a stopper device, which splashes and makes a mess. The mess is more evident because the coffeemaker is white. The coffee it makes is marginal, seems to take more coffee to make it ordinary strength. I would not recommend this coffeemaker."
3,Not bad,"The Bosch 12 cup coffeemaker is good for the price of $24.00 but its plastic construction and support holding the large top lid is way to flimsy. It has broken twice. So,it functions well but I have to manually push the drip arm over the coffee filter. Next time I will spend the extra $$ to purchase a better constructed coffeemaker. I am not certain as to country of origin but this coffeemaker does NOT come from Bosch in Germany."
1,Discovery Atlas Italy & Australia DOES NOT WORK,"I have done some researching online and found out that these 2 HD-DVDs have been recorded in a different way from the Brazil & China which do work. DO NOT ORDER this product until they have created a working batch. I have also spoken with Discovery Channel and they advised they are aware of the problem and are trying to get this problem resolved. I was advised to return the product from where I bought it and keep checking back with them. Be very cautious who you purchase this from. You dont want to order a defective title and then not be able to get your refund. The only ones working at this time as mentioned above is Brazil and China, you should be ok ordering those."
3,"It's good, but the narration is in French.","As indicated in my earlier review, I listened to some RealAudio segments of a few musical cuts and ordered a copy on the basis of what I heard. Unfortunately, for those who don't speak French, the NARRATIVE portion of the work, done in the original by Duke, is in French. Lyrics are in English, but ""Congo Square,"" the narrative highlight of the work (for me) is not. Caveat emptor."
4,Terrible Tragedy Wonderfully Told,"Philbrick deserves the praise given to Into the Heart of the Sea. In giving a historic account of the true story that gave inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Philbrick unveils the world of the Nantucket whaling industry and the fate of one unfortunate crew. For a history book, this is a rich page-turner that is uncommon in its historic depth and compelling narrrative."
3,Moderately Hype-Worthy,"Much has been written (and now shown on national TV) about Philbrick's ""In the Heart of the Sea"". This short (less than 300 page) historical account of the whaleship Essex will quickly send those who are fans of the genre back to the Andes Mountains of the early 1970s in ""Alive"" and the New England coastline where the hearty seamen from ""The Perfect Storm"" met their fate. What separates Philbrick's writing (and ultimately makes the book interesting) is the often graphic and well-researched accounting of 1820s Nantucket and the brutal lives of the whalers who made a living by going off to sea for nearly 2 years at a time. I cannot rate the book higher only because while the storyline is compelling, I did not find the story of such a unique character as to separate it from other books that deal with brutal human hardships."
4,Window into a lost world,"A harrowing recount of a Nantucket whaleship's destruction in the Pacific, stoved in by an angry whale. The story inspired Melville to write Moby Dick, but's it's a gripping tale of survival all on its own. The survivors of the sinking have to make sail with their tiny skiffs across half of the Pacific Ocean.The story is grim but incredible. Philbrick wears his research lightly, although his work is thorough the research doesn't get in the way of telling the story well. It's a real window the lost world of the Nantucket whalers, their culture and life, as well as the story of men's behaviour when tested to the limits."
5,Very Entertaining,This book was the first in the series and it has gotten me hooked. I am going to read all five books and will enjoy everyone.
2,Of Limited Worth,"For the raw beginner wishing to gain an insight into the various methods of gluing veneer using a variety of different adhesives and their accompanying techniques, this book more than adequately serves to address this function. However, the all-important minutiae of veneering are not touched upon in any respect. The art of veneering lies not so much in the methods of gluing, but in the laying-out and trimming, particularly where the edges are concerned. An examination of any piece of pre 20th century cabinetwork will bear out this conclusion: the edges are blended with an almost surgical degree of precision to give the impression that the piece has been hewn from a solid piece of wood. This book's title should read: ""A Beginner's Guide to Gluing Veneer"" which is a far more accurate description of this book's contents and function."
5,better than gas-x,take two of these compared to 4 gas-x and all is well. cheaper and less pills. this is a great product at a great price.
2,Disappointing start from Conrad,"This is Joseph Conrads first novel. It deals with the conflicts between native people (Malayans) and Dutch tradesmen in the jungle of Borneo. It has some brilliant passages, but all in all it's a quite dull read."
5,Excellent,"I live in Kobe, Japan. I went a concert of Kremerata Baltica last year. Fortunately I encountered this program, ""Eight Seasons"". Everybody who was there at that night is a witness of miracle. So nice play, very few left concert hall. This CD is also very impressive, I found. Kremer is also good for very classical classic. Buy one copy."
1,Still a Mystery,"Anybody who is interested in learning about the beauty of Sufism should not turn to this book. This book, in fact, does not examine anything of intellectual, spiritual, or social value as related to Sufism or Islam. I have come across many books written by so-called Sufi Masters, who expound upon the complexity of the universe with inspirational imagery. This is not one of them. While books in this genre easily turn into polemics, this one surely takes the unenlightened cake. The stream of consciousness writing style lacks purpose in this setting and appears to have been an 'easy way out' of organizing a coherent book of ideology."
3,"Está bien, dependiendo para qué lo quieres","Compré La Historia de la Belleza para mi tesis sobre estética. Estudio Filosofía y al momento de hacer una tesis sobre estética creo que ya tengo algo de información al respecto, por este motivo sólo por este no recomiendo el libro; es decir no lo recomiendo si lo buscas con fines académicos, al menos que quieras algo muy genérico y amplio. Sin embargo, si deseas hacer una aproximación a ""la belleza"" es libro es ua maravilla, tiene un lenguaje muy ameno, directo y simple que no complica su lectura. Además, se trata de un libro perfecto para mesita de café en la sala de casa, porque está lleno de láminas e imágenes y los textos son bastante cortos, por eso se trata del libro perfecto para pasar el tiempo mientras alguie te dejó solo esperando en la sala.La Historia de la Belleza"
5,Opens up a world of possibilities,My wife wanted to get rid of the phone line connection for our Tivo. She couldn't stand the phone line snaking around the family room to the outlet. The Tivo wireless adapter took care of that issue and opened up lots of possibilities. I have now used Amazon Unbox to get a video and download it over the network to the Tivo box. Easy to do once you download the Amazon Unbox software.The adapter was easy to connect. I followed the very easy to follow instructions on the Tivo site to connect the adapter and set up the network. Make sure to follow the directions and not try to bypass something because you think you know what you are doing. I'm an electrical engineer and tried to figure it out without reading the instructions. Much easier to follow the excellent Tivo instructions.
4,Great condition and prompt delivery,The product was in good condition and it came in the mail in a timely manner.
4,TIVO Wireless Adapter,The TIVO adapter was easy to set up and works perfectly with my Linksys router. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the industrial strength packaging that I had to saw my way through.
5,Yeah for Wireless TiVo!,"Great product and price (bought from System 405, Inc). Quick shipping and worked great. Tired of paying more for your land land than TiVo service or tripping over phone wires? Easy plug and play adapter and 5 minutes to set up to run with your wireless network."
5,Wireless Tivo adapter,"The Tivo Ag0100 Wireless G USB Network Adapter for Tivo is just what I needed for my Tivo. My phone jack was clear across the room and every time I wanted to connect to Tivo, I had to drag a 30 foot cord across the room and plug it in. Then I would forget to connect and Tivo would have to remind me to connect or I wouldn't get updated information for my recordings. I have a wireless laptop and I heard that tivo could connect to my broadband wireless connection with an adapter. This adapter solved all my problems. It was so easy to connect right into the USB port of the Tivo unit and I never have to think about connecting now. It's great!"
3,Looks nice but !,I had been using an old wifi card that wasn't supposed to work with my Series 3 but it did. I decided to get the new adapter on advice from my son but I honestly can say that I don't see any difference at all .
5,TiVo Wirless Adapter Gives Your More,"I have 3 TiVo machines each hooked to one of these; two of them are HD. Having a wireless adapter allows you the freedom of placing your TiVo machine away from a phone connection and it is a lot faster. In the case of the HDs, they are linked so you can transfer programs from upstairs to downstairs, you can pull photos/videos off your computer, and you can download movies/videos from places such as Amazon - Un-box. Can't hook up the Comcast Scientific Alanta DVR to this network, but if it wasn't almost free with digital cable, I'd have another TiVo with one of these adapters."
3,Works as advertised,If you are struggling with another brand of wireless adapter for your Tivo do yourself a favor and get this one. This item deserves 5 stars for usability but I gave it three because it's a shame Tivo almost forces you to use their propriety adapter when there are dozens of other cheaper brands that work with most all wireless products.
5,Absolutely Perfect!,"After I had my landline disconnected and began using my cell phone, I thought my TiVo would be useless. I tried to hook it up wirelessly with a linksys adapter and it didn't work. With a lot of reservations, I ordered TiVo AG0100. Since I'm about as far from a computer geek as you can get, I was praying it wouldn't take me weeks to figure out how to use it. The day it arrived I took a deep breath and plugged it into the back of the TiVo. Immediately, I got the prompt that a wireless connection had been detected. From there, all I had to do was enter the network name and encryption key. The entire process took me less than ten minutes, and now I have my TiVo back! One caveat; I did have to restart my TiVo afterward, but I think it was because I'd let the information run out before my AG0100 arrived. I love this adapter!"
4,Ease of Use!!,"TIVO locked upon install, but chatted with tech support and they provided me a code to get it unlocked. Other than that, operates well, no complaints. Would recommend if you want to have a TIVO set up without having a bunch of ethernet cables ran to it. Can attest that this DOES work with TIVO HD Premiere!! Don't spend extra on the 'G' unless you absolutely want to, this works just fine!!!"
5,Excellent Product,"Excellent product. If you are using your tivo through a telephone cord and have wireless in your home, you should definitely by this and switch. (I did not rate customer service because I have had no problems.)"
5,Gets the job done,It works as advertised. It is unfortunate that Tivo doesn't support as many G class wireless adapters as it did with B. I'm hoping that they come out with an inexpensive 802.11N adapter so I can transfer shows to and from my Tivo at better rates.
3,Works OK,"I love the functionality that this device gives the tivo. Being able to transfer recordings to the tivo is great. I just feel that it should be faster than it is, though I'm not sure if the lag in the menus is due to this device or it's just the tivo. Also, it seems to lose connection to my LAN occasionally and needs to be resetup, not sure why. Being able to download movies from Amazon, cheaply and easily, is the biggest bonus in my opinion. I definitely recommend the product, just wish that the tivo menus were a bit more responsive and that it was solid with the network."
5,Great upgrade to our system,"We have 2 series 2 tivo DVRa in seprate rooms. We were not ready to upgrade our boxes, but the wireless adadapters were a less expensive upgrade we decided to try. The adapters allow us to share shows between the 2 DVRs and our computer with the software from TIVO. Now we can tape different shows on each, but watch them wherever we want.Glad we did it. Easy to set up, just plug them in and enter the wi-fi password. took about 5 minutes."
5,Flawless for N Router,"I purchased this after upgrading to a ""N"" router. The wireless adapter I had for Tivo no longer worked. This was a flawless installation and has worked perfectly in the month since I have used it."
4,Big Improvement over Phone line,"We purchased this because we were tired of Tivo taking over our home phone line. This adapter was very easy to install, and within 10 minutes it was programmed and ready to go. Very pleased with the product and delivery."
3,"Works, but could be better","I have it hooked up to my Tivo in the living room and I get between 50-58% signal strength. Not great considering my laptop in the same room gets about 80-90% signal strength. Tivo's suggestion of getting the adapter closer to my wireless router is a joke. The reason I have this is so they can be apart. If they were closer, I would just use a network cable."
5,Great product,"It was very easy to install the Tivo Wireless G Usb Network adapter. I did have some problems hooking it up to the wireless, but that was my fault. It is now working great. It is so small most do not even see it."
5,This works great,Quick delivery on these 2 wireless adapters let us install and get our TIVO up and running in no time. These adapters allows our two tivo's to basically talk to each other. We can watch what is recording on one can be view on the other. Great reception as well. The TIVO people will walk you thru installation if necessary.
5,Superb,This product works great and we are happy to be able to use TIVO again. We did not have a phone line because of using cell phones. This brought this capability back to us. We are very happy. THANKS!
5,Nice adapter!,"The adapter arrived quickly and effortlessly and just like that, poof! our Tivo was wireless. It's a wondrous thing, this Tivo Wireless adapter.I highly recommend it. If you have Tivo."
5,TiVo Wireless Adapter Works Great,I have been using TiVo with the TiVo Wireless USB Network Adapter for several months now and I haven't had any issues with this device. I was pleased to see the device work right from the start. I just plugged it in and TiVo recognized the device and started communicating with the TiVo servers.
5,Works Perfect!,Works perfectly with our new HD Tivo. Very easy to set-up and use. And a great price on Amazon.com
3,ok,"All things considered, it's okay. It was a pain in the rear to set up. It doesn't seem to work as well as it could, but it basically does the job."
2,Doesn't work with Tivo Basic,"This item will not work with Tivo Basic (the Tivo service included on some Pioneer and Toshiba boxes). We bought a Pioneer 810H several years ago that included Tivo. This is Tivo Basic and this item requires Tivo Plus. You do not have a Media Access Key if you have Tivo Basic, which is required to get this to work. Unfortunately, Tivo Plus is an upgrade to Basic, so it costs extra. Since we already paid a lot for the box (equal to a lifetime membership), we didn't want to do that again and sent it back, so I can't really attest to its functionality or ease of use (although it was a huge pain to figure out why we didn't have a MAK...that took some serious googling since they don't make our box anymore)."
4,The only adapter that works with Series 3 TiVo,"I just got a TiVo Series 3, and hoped to use my Linksys USB adapter to connect to the network. It didn't happen. TiVo has programmed the new boxes to only accept their adapter (a message pops up to let you know this when you try to plug anything else in.I was going to just hardwire it, but relented and bought the TiVo adapter. Plugged it in and it fired right up. I also understand this adapter does some of the proceesing for the TiVo, so there is some benefit to using it over another brand (if you have a Series 2, which will accept other adapters).So I give it high marks for ease of use and performance, but deducted for crippling the Series 3 to force me to use it, and price.I don't have WEP enabled yet, but doubt it will be a problem when I do. I use a Linksys WRT-54g router.If you don't want to mess around getting your TiVo to connect through your wireless network connection, this is the way to do it."
4,"Interesting, but slow","The Mayor of Casterbridge isn't really about a man who sells his wife and daughter. Yes, that is part of it, but 80% of the story has little to do with that fact. In actuality, it is about relationships, and the choices we make that can have an impact on those we love. The story twists and turns, and weaves several different characters' stories into one neat ending, but can be predictable at times.I personally enjoyed the book, but it can be slow and predictable at times, as I already mentioned."
2,A mash of cobbled coincidences,"This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection, but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."
1,Excruciatingly Boring,"I began reading this novel since it has such a great reputation as being a ""classic."" However, after reading well over a hundred pages, the book failed to keep my attention in the least bit. The plot is weak and pathetic, and the characters are too one-dimensional. Although it may pick up later, it certainly is not worth it."
2,Chapter Missing,"Even though it is free, and I appreciate that, there was about a chapter missing. I would suggest this either be fixed, or the book removed from sale."
1,missing most of chapter 20,Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit. Suggest you try another kindle version.
1,Waste of paper,"I recently had to read this book as part of my English GCSE and I can honestly say that much paper has been wasted and our trees are being destroyed to churn out a book, which is quite frankly absolutly awfull. I also am very glad that I was not around to ever meet Thomas Hardy as from this book it sounds to me that he may well of been a manic depresent, also in most, if not all, of his other books they all end in a very sad a depressing way. Hardy describes Henchard as 'dogged' and i feel if you want to read this you too will have to be dogged and determind to start and finish this book."
2,Dubious creation,"There is already a book very similar to this one about a dog's adventure in Paris. Findley took credit,with the true author's approval however, for this book that John Demires actually entirely wrote. The book was indeed entertaining and it gave a good overview of many of New Orleans' novel attractions."
4,Love this album,"I really am glad to have found this album on Amazon for such a reasonable price. My favorite Songs are #Let Me Know, # Stupid and # Let's Chill... I love her voice!"
3,Refreshing Perspective on Faith,"An intelligent critical analysis of the New Testament, particularly the four gospels. Gives thoughtful seekers the freedom to come to faith without having to abandon their intelligence. Author suggests it is not necessary to take every story in the gospels literally in order to learn the important lessons or to come to know Jesus as the Savior."
5,Rare Glow Fribee Delivered Fast,"I live in a small town with the local Wal-Mart as the 'get all' store. Yea, like they are classy enough to carry Whamo glow frisbees. Leave it to AMAZON to direct me to this exact Model Frisbee. SO easy on checkout...No problems and my son is starting to understand how to fly a frisbee! Thanks much you guys!"
1,Don't Bother,"Bought this for my aging father-in-law, he couldn't read it, said it was too complicated, and he already knew how to play pinochle so this book was pretty much a bomb. Don't waste your money."
1,Very boring film....,"I'm a huge Nirvana fan. I got this movie because I figured it might be good......Well.....it's ""based"" on Kurt but honestly to me it didn't make any sence at all..... I know everything there is to know about Kurt.....I didn't like this movie one bit... It bored me to death......on his final days no one knew where he was so yeah....those friends of his didn't exist.....Well. For all you Nirvana/Kurt fans don't buy this movie. If you like Gus Van Sant I guess you could get this movie.....are all his movies this boring?"
1,The worst movie Ive every seen,"This movie was the worst movie Ive ever seen, Waste of 90 mins of time. I wish I could get paid for the time I wasted watching it.And no I ""get It""It is not art."
2,BEWARE!!!,"This was a good movie from an artistic perspective, like what everyone else said so far (very very slow, quiet etc.). However only one person mentioned the fact that there is a gay scene. There is a gay scene! By gay scene I mean two guys making-out on a bed.I I guess it could be worse, but (being hetero) I had a hard time accepting it's connection to Kurt Cobain. I Just have to make sure you all know what you're getting in to."
4,The Pearl Jam Lion sucks...not Pearl jam,"Let's clarify something...one, this is supposed to be reviews of the movie, not the merits of two great bands. Second, why in hell a Pearl Jam fan would jump up and say ""Cobain is overrated"" is beyond me...it makes other Pearl Jam fans look like morons. Both bands have their supporters and their detractors, but no one can take away from the fact that they were both very different, very talented, and only have the ""Seattle stigma"" to connect them. People seem to forget near the end of Cobain's life that both Cobain and Eddie Vedder had a mutual respect for each other, only able to occur after both of them dropped their pretenses and actually paid attention and learned what the other was really doing. Fans could stand to do the same and make their heroes, dead or alive, proud."
1,Dreadful,"The _not_ Cobain character rambles, mumbles, stutters, attempts to write music and finally manages to kill himself, about five minutes before I was ready to kill myself.Avoid."
4,On A Plain and I Can't Complain,"This movie has received mixed reviews and I can understand why. Those expecting something similar to ""The Doors"", ""Sid and Nancy"" or ""24 Hour Party People"" will be extremely disappointed. However, those expecting nothing at all may actually find themselves intrigued by this stunning piece of ""art on film"". The film is beautifully shot. The vibrant colors in many scenes contrast the feeling of sadness and loneliness conveyed by the main character, Blake. I was very impressed by this film and it stayed with me for many days after my initial viewing. That is when I realized that ""Last Days"" was not a MOVIE, but rather, a work of art. I know that may sound kind of dumb but it really felt like I had just viewed a painting at an art museum or something. I've never experienced that before. So I guess the question is: Was it worth the time viewing this ""motion picture art"" for 2 hours? My answer: Absolutely."
2,neck harness - poor design,"Neck harness is a great addition to the gym equipment, however, this specific one is less than comfortable. This harness is the first one I tried so I am not sure how it compares with others on the market."
5,Finally!,"Finally a head harness that is meant to hold some weight!very sturdy construction, padded and adjustable!"
3,Intruder in the Dust Review,"I have a Literature exam tomorrow - kind of a final- and this is one of the books included. I never got past chapter 2 but I really wish I had! I just couldn't keep up with it but I'm pretty sure that if I understood what I was reading I would have enjoyed it very much. The sentences are extremely long and by the time you get to the end of one, you don't even know what you read. I think that Faulkner's ""stream of conciousness"" writing is very interesting - you need to read it as if you were having a conversation with Faulker and he's telling you the story and he's jumping all over the place. I SHOULD TAKE MY OWN ADVICE...BUT ANYWAY GIVE IT A CHANCE!"
5,"Riveting story, great characterization, vibrant.","For everyone that loves John Grisham, and his legal thrillers.You really owe it to yourself to read Faulkner. Once you capturehis rant, and learn to wade through his long sentences-you willbe glued to this novel. His writing pattern and imagery areaddictive, and you will want to learn more about him and otherMississippi writers like Larry Brown, and Barry Hannah--notthe millionaire from Oxford."
1,Bites,"I hated this book. William Faulkner has to be the poorest excuse for a writer that ever lived. I got so tired of his pages long sentences and parentheticals within parentheticals within sentences within parentheticals (I wish I were making this up). To make matters worse, sometimes his parentheticals were so long, I forgot what preceded it! And let's not forget his made-up words (uninsatiable? ever hear of a dictionary, Will? IT'S NOT IN THERE!) This book bites, HARD. And let's face it, if he were alive today, no way would anyone with a brain publish this garbage. At least not without some serious editing."
1,Long sentences that are extremely confusing.,"Bad book overall, only interesting about the themes of discrimination"
4,about the long sentences...,"he purposely made the sentences long like that for a reason. through his style, he was trying to show you the mindset of people in the South after World War 2. If you don't understand why he made that choice, don't go off saying that it's just poor writing, you are making yourself sound stupid like that."
3,This book makes you think and THINK a lot !!!,"My opinion is that this book was overly long and boring. The ideas and the narratives are difficult to understand. Of course, the book is an enticing novel or racism in the south. Of couse what the hell do I know? I am 16 years old."
5,Compelling Reading,"Did you ever wonder about the synchronicities in your life? Ever look at the clock only to see it say 11:11, again and again? Maybe these are hints to your connection with the universe and the spirits that inhabit it. Pay attention and grab a copy of this book. George Barnard has paid attention and has been working in the service of the 1,111 spirit guardians that are the permanent residents of this planet and these are his stories. Read this book and then think about your own opportunities.Something's happening hereWhat it is ain't exactly clear-Buffalo Springfield-"
2,"okay, but not great","I used this to study for the recertification exam in the summer of '09. I passed the exam, but I'm not sure how much this book helped. It focused a lot of questions on certain diseases that were not on the exam, and some diseases that were hit multiple times on the exam were never mentioned in the book. Also, like other reviewers have mentioned, there are numerous mistakes and dated practice guidelines in the book. If I had to do it over again, I would try a different book."
1,too many errors! How can I trust what I am studying!,"I have been out of medicine for 5 years and am reviewing to re-enter practice. I am only on question #145 but have come across 6-10 errors- mainly things that are contradicting previous answers. Many times I am double-checking answers on up to date.Otherwise, I guess the material is fine, but really for me personally, it is intolerable to have so many errors. Studying should NOT induce extra anxiety!!I have stopped using this book and just ordered Swanson's 6th edition and one other resource as well."
1,Errors. Repetitive questions. Some out-of-date answers.,"I threw it away after 100 pages. Spend the $300+ on Core Content. (I've no financial relationship with them.) Also, I used the Kaplan Master the Boards for Int Med and I'm getting the one for Peds for my ABFM exam."
3,"Helpful, but certainly not well edited.",I just finished the book. I prefer to do questions when studying for boards. It is a good book to use to study just prior to the boards and helps get you in the mind set of thinking in terms of questions.My biggest gripe about the book is that some of the answers were just plain wrong...and the explanations that were given to substantiate the wrong answers contradicted the answers. There were some typos as well. Having some noticeably wrong answers does not give me a whole lot of confidence about the other answers that I was learning from.Best of luck.
5,Bond...Brilliant!,"Another outstanding DVD production. This one filled with more music, but the lighting for the finale is poor. Great buy!"
2,Not My Style,"I got interested in this group as I was looking at a U-Tube video that utilized the song ""Lullaby"" from the Bond Classified album as back-drop music. I was so mesmerized by the tune I bought every Bond album there was available as well as this Live video. Unfortunately, for me - all the other songs on all the other albums were nothing like the ""Lullaby"" song and quite honestly, I threw everything else in the trash. This is not to say that the group plays bad music or are untalented in any respect...This type of Techno-Symphony is just not my speed...I prefer soft rock as opposed to this."
2,Get's boring,"What's not to like about four hot chicks shaking their bottoms playing classical music? ""Victory"", the song you probably heard in the watch commercial is by far their best song. All the others are not so great. Unfortunately, it gets tiresome after a while, the bottom-shaking and classical music - definitely not something that will stay with us for a while."
1,eye/ear catching,"well i as well saw/heared the DVD playing at a local electronic store and was tempted to buy it.after the first time playing it i was dissapointed to find only a couple notes worthy of listenign to.after the 2nd round the dvd became old.the impressions looked fake and the energy everybodys talking about somehow didnt show on my DVD.to sum it up, i expected something new and exciting and i found an early 80`s like band playing on a cheap movie.not really recomended."
1,FAKE,"very disapointed in this DVD!it is not live! they are very obviously faking playing to a recordingthat being said, I enjoy the cds and will probably buy future releases...but after watching the dvd, it makes me wonder if there is a Milli Vanilli thing going on here"
2,"FACTS good, authors OPINION on religion(s) unnecessary","Edward Chiera presented wonderful information on his research of ancient civilizations. Very easy to read for Jr. High students. However, his personal comments on religion(s) was just that, his personal comments, nothing factual. Recommeded reading for students with religious chapters omitted."
5,A wonderful CD,This is a wonderful CD from Nick Kemp who studied with Richard Bandler the creator of NLP.The CD takes the listener on a magical ride into deep relaxation and altered states and produces a great sense of well being. The music is fantastic and the intricate use of hypnosis makes this an important product for students of NLP and hypnosis.
2,used to be good,"I have lots of these , using them almost daily as underware . my first pair having purchased at least 6 years ago. my two most recent purchases of these has yielded a variety of quality and sizes . seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control . won't be buying again"
5,The original accept no substitute!,These are amazing! My workouts are some much better with these! Support galore yet pliant for easy movement! The fabric formula is an Uner Armour exclusive! Yes! It matters. Athletes rejoice in total support! Way recommended!
5,great product,My husband loves theses. They fit great and get the job done.The blue that I ordered for him is a really nice solid color.
5,"Great Quality, Quick Shipping",Great for running and staying cool. I have a pair of Starter brand compression shorts that are awful in comparison to these.
5,Just what he wanted,"I purchased this for my partner. It is exactly what he wanted. He really loves them! Very comfortable, excellent fit, perfect for workouts."
4,I like 'em,"I bought one pair of these and one pair of Road Runner Sports Velocity compression shorts to compare for running. I thought the UA pair was going to feel very hot, as the material is thick compared to other brands (Nike, RRS, etc). These must do a great job wicking away moisture, because they felt very comfortable on a 20 mile run, and not hot like others in comparison. There is a reason you see UA products everywhere, they are really quality goods. I'll be wearing these next weekend for a marathon, if that tells you the level of confidence and comfort (no chafing with these!) I have in this product. Would give 5 stars, but I've got to own them a bit longer before I go all in."
4,"Disappointed initially, but still worthwhile","When I purchased these, I was thought they had a pad in the crotch area. I wanted to use them for cycling. Well, they don't have a pad and even worse there is a seam running right through the center. This is usually a bad thing for me because it can cause chaffing in a place that can be very uncomfortable. However, I decided to use these shorts anyways to see what would happen. Fortunately, they didn't chafe me. I do find them to be a bit tighter than I expected as well, but again it ultimately doesn't cause any issues. Therefore, I have to say that it was a good deal considering the price difference between these and the ones that cost significantly more but have a pad."
5,Great product!,"The product came quickly and was exactly what I wanted. In the past, these shorts have been great quality and have lasted much longer than other brands I have tried."
5,HOKEY BUT SATISFYING,.....Somewhat dated and a little syrupy but if you like to be entertained the Gaynor/March original is superior to the remakes with Garland/Mason and Streisand/Kristophern.
2,Tasted awful and did not really work for me,"I was referred to this product by a lactation consultant who swore by it. I had gone back to work a few weeks prior and my supply was dwindling severly due to the pump not being nearly as efficient as my little man. I began taking far more than the recommended dose of the More Milk Plus, in an effort to really up my supply. The product tasted really nasty, even when mixed with a strong tasting drink and I did not see any major difference in my supply."
2,Casey at the Bat,"One of the book covers was torn and covered with a black substance. It was unsuitable to gift to the intended recipient. I had to obtain another book locally. I tried to contact Horizon Books via telephone, but never got an answer. I would appreciate a replacement copy!"
5,Wonderful reading for all guitar enthuiasts.,"In The PRS Guitar Book, Dave Burrluck describes in detail the evolution of PRS Guitars, the renowned company founded by expert guitar maker Paul Reed Smith in 1985. The PRS Guitar Book showcases every artistic and technical facet of these exquisite instruments that sold to an enthusiasts clientele for $2000 and up. The PRS Guitar Book is enhanced with lavish color photography, anecdotes and reminiscences from Smith, famous guitarists, and PRS employees, collectors and fans. The PRS Guitar Book is highly recommended, wonderful reading for all serious guitar enthusiasts, professional or amateur."
2,OK but not great,"If you are going to spend the money on a book regarding spearfishing, spend the extra money for ""Bluewater Hunting and Freediving"" by Terry Maas. It has much more info that this book.This book is elementary at best."
1,Save your money,"Although this book has some decent pictures the writing and analysis is below average. Writer appears more interested in underwater photography. His coverage of spearguns borders on the flimsy. He appears to have little actual experience in this area. Book is only 133 pages. 1. I saw no pictures of author with fish. 2. Written in third party format. Appears to be commercial diver or instructor. 3. Speargun coverage lightweight, knowledge of powerheads insufficient. Nothing on shark defense. 4. Seems to condone not using safeties on guns. 5. Does not use own equipment in book but refers to borrowed spearguns, etc.. 6. Appears to own little or none of his own spearing equipment. Written from the reporter, photographer point of view. I recommend looking elsewhere."
4,quite good,fairly basic but fundamental intro to spearfishing with a few gems often missed in other more 'advanced' books.worth having in your 'spearo' collection.
3,Spearfishing for Skin and Scuba Divers,"Pretty good, a little dated but gives you most of the info you'll need to get started."
5,Great book for Physiotheraby Board exam,"I find this book very helpful. It's very organized, concise and well explained. It is a good source of review along with you.I am highly recommending this book to anyone aspiring for more knowledge in the exam."
2,Not very good,"We own every European travel book that exists. I can honestly say that this one is by far the worst one I have seen, hands down. The coverage of accommodations is sparse and only includes extraordinarily expensive hotels, for the most part, and the dining recommendations are little better. There are no unique tips in this guide and it really covers 6 cities, and not very comprehensively. I give an extra star for making the attempt to write a kids travel guide, since they are not common."
1,Boring,I read a lot of historical fiction. This is perhaps the third novel in the last 10 years that I could not finish because it was so slow. I forced myself to 250 or 270 pages but the story drags on.Its simply boring.
3,"""My Opinion""",(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S. WHERE I LIVE I HAVE SEEN THE FILA TRUCK AND WITH THESE SPECIFIC PAIR OF SHOES ON IT AND I SAID TO MYSELF OUT OF ALL THE FILA'S I'VE WORN I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THESE AND I HAVE TO HAVE A PAIR OF THEM.SO THIS IS MY OPINION THAT IF YOU ALL HAVEN'T MADE ANY OF THEM OR HAVE EVER SENT ANY TO MY STATE I THINK YOU SHOULD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC COLOR EVERY WHERE I GO AND PEOLPE REALLY SAID THEY WOULD BUY THEM TO ONLY IF YOU SOLD THEM OR PUT THEM ON THE INTERNET SO IF YOU CAN COULD YOU PLEASE SEND ME A E-MAIL BACK FOR I COULD PURCHASE THESE SHOES OR COULD YOU PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING THESE COLOR OF SHOE SO PLENTY OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS LIKE ME COULD CONTINUE PURCHASING YOUR PRODUCT.THANK YOU
4,"Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck","The story took place in Soledad, California during the Great Depression. There were two migrant workers mentioned in this book, George and Lennie. They were best friends. Their relationship symbolizes strong vs. weak. One of them always causes the other trouble. You will think the weak one always causes strong trouble right? But the truth is, the strong guy(Lennie) always causes the weak(George) trouble. Why was that? First Lennie cause tiny problems, then bigger and finally the biggest trouble. Now what and how should the weak one(George) help or save his best friend?I give the rate of 4 stars to this book. It's a great book for love, friendship and at a loss as what to do. The theme of this book is sometimes friends have to force themselves do something that he/she doesn't want to. I recommend this book to those young children and adults who have been lost as to what to do."
4,A Simple Read,"Of Mice and Men was about the best book I have ever read. It's a story of George and Lenny, two men that have not much more than each other. It's a captivating book, but not one to read if you like exciting, happily ever after endings. John Steinbeck is not that kind of writer. Everything that happens in the book is foreshadowed, and by the end it has you saying, ""Oh, that's why he wrote whate he wrote in the beginning."" It's a great book and a must read for high school students."
4,"Review of ""of mice and Men""","""Of Mice and Men"" writen by John Steinbeek is a book which narrates during the great depression era, the relationship of two men among the indifference of the world around them.Those are George -described as a small and quick and dark of face- and Lennie -a very strong and tall guy who has the mind of a young child.As they travel together, Lennie goes getting them into trables. That's why they had to move form Weed to Soledad. They only want to reach their dream, to get a own place where yo live, but Lennie's actions get him into a trable which has awful and irrepable consequences that affect not only himself and George but also other characters of the story.This is a story of loneliness, frienship, loyalty and corage."
4,Of Mice and Men,"Of Mice and Men is about two friends that are on a journey together. Lennie is a big man that is strong, and has memeory problems. George watches over Lennie and cares for him. They aren't related, just friends. Lennie likes to pet soft things, and often leads him to trouble.They got ran out of their old town because of something Lennie did. Now they are trying to get a new job working on a farm, in hopes of geting enough money to get their own farm. George convinces Lennie to work hard and try not to get in trouble. George tells Lennie he can tend the rabbits when the get the farm, as motivation.Read this book and find out what happens to George and Lennie."
4,Of Mice and Men,"Of Mice and Men, written during the great depression, explains, in beautiful detail, the life of two homless men. The book takes place on a ranch in Soledad, California. George and Lennie are the main characters. These two homeless men travel around the United States looking for work. They find it in Soledad. George is small and has all the brains bteween the two friends, Lennie is tal and slow but ""One hell of a strong worker,"" according to George. I canit say anymore. They dream of making enough money at this ranch and buy a small plot of land with a small house on it. It's a short book with only one hundered and eighteen pages. It is one of the best classic,s I've ever read, (the others being The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series.) The main and supporting characters are George and Lennie, Slim, Crooks, Curley, Curley's Wife (she doesn't have a name), Carlson, and Candy. I'm not going to tell the end but I will say that it is quite depressing, though a great book."
1,The REAL Of Mice and men,"Now, then:Of Mice and Men Is one of the worst books I have ever read. Let me count the ways:1) It has immeasuably two dimensional chacters. Steinbeck stays so close to the archetypal ""strong man"" ""seedy guy"" ""angry little guy"" ""seductive wife"" its disgusting. he even has a token black guy! Absurd.2) An equally two-dimensional plot. Steinbeck's unbearable heavy handedness in getting his all important ""moral"" across completely crushes out any vestige of meaningful charcterization or subtext.3) The ending. No, I'm not about to say ""ew!"" What i will say is that thats what he WANTS you to think. He wants you to put down this book and ""realzie the impossibility the america dream, and the cutthroat nature of humans in general."" The problem with this conclusion is the entire book is completely contrived! The most absurd confluence of cicumstances that could possible occur come togethr in this book. its all crap.There. Just in case you missed it...[...]"
5,A simple tale for the ages,"An outstanding, chilling, and thought provoking book that helped to shape my thought processes as an adolescent when I read the book for the first time, Of Mice and Men is Steinbeck's most succinct piece. A delicacy I enjoyed again this past summer, its messages change, its characters evolve, and its definitions are redefined with a readers age and experience.Regardless, this book is a classic and a staple for any fan of literature."
5,All time classic-fast read,"I was on a ""classic"" book binge this summer. This was the last on my list and it was the perfect way to wind down after books like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""The Great Gatsby"" and ""The Bell Jar""."
5,book,This item arrived on time and it was just as described! Highly recommended and great to do business with! Thanks.
5,a good book,I am from BLA high school in the bronx and I thank my teacher MS. Solomon for giving us this book to read. This book tells the story of true friends and how hard it was during the great depression. From this book I have learned that sometimes you just got to do what is best for you and your friend. This book always has a new surprise. The author uses symbolism and foreshadowing to tell the story. As the story goes on the better it gets. I have read this book twice and I can just keep reading it over and over because it tells such good details and information. Reading this book you will feel as if you were there because the action never ends you will keep being surprised until the last sentence of the book.
5,"Tell it again, George . . .","It's easy to see why Steinbeck's classic has been the subject of study for so many years; it's a master-class of literary form. Clean prose and simple storytelling, no added unnecessarys. Even the metaphor is unfussy.But Steinbeck's true gift lies in characterisation and his understanding of dialogue. When his characters speak and act they betray themselves for who they are. The reader listens and sees, gleans a past from the characters' voices and gestures. The power of the novel comes from the intimacy the reader has with these characters, and it's a testament to Steinbeck that in such a short book he reveals so much.Everyone should meet Lennie and George at least once, and if you do, you'll never forget them."
5,Classic,"I accidentally ordered this. The day it arrived, I spent the afternoon enthralled by Steinbeck's writing and his unique view of the world. ""East of Eden"" is one of my very favorite books and I don't really know why I've never read ""Of Mice and Men"" before. I vaguely remember seeing it as a play while I was in high school.A story about two men working together to attain their own version of the American Dream, it brings up many ethical questions and can lead to some interesting discussion and thought.Excellent. I no longer have to wonder why it is a classic."
3,Great Book to read for English class,"This book is a great book to read and do a project on for a LA class, mostly honors LA, 8th grade and upto HS. What makes it so good is the fact that the plotline is interesting, even if it does get thrown away in a suprise ending, it is intresting to read about until that point. It is short, you can read it in 1-2 days, and LA teachers love it because it is one of those novels that gets you to think 'critically'. It's a win-win-win. Great story for your entertainment, short if you are short on time, and gets you to think. It actully contains some pretty heavy stuff in a little package."
3,Steinbeck's worse....???,Steinbeck himself thought this book was most likely his worst workings.The story line is quite intresting and humorous from time to time.Though its plagued with wordiness and underdeveloped characters.The over all message of the book is excellent and is portrayed as such.
4,This book was pretty good,"I had to read this book for school, so at first I didn't appreciate it. Now, after I finished it, I think it is a great book. I recommend this book to others."
4,Of Mice and Men,"Stienbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"" was a prime novel, filled with important issues and underlying motives. There were many forshadowing events that led up to the (to me) unexpected ending.The two charactors, George and Lennie, are developed into astounding realisim. From the descisons and the thought patterns to thier problems and people skills the two men bloom into fenominal people.I enjoyed this novel because it constantly had me reading inbetween the lines. It also captured my attention with its realisem."
4,Great book,"I enjoyed reading this novel. It taught the true meaning of a friendship. It was the story of a dream that was unreachable, but George kept the dream alive for Lennie, until he was forced to...nevermind I won't tell the ending. Read it, the ending id great!"
2,of mice and men,"The story is about two gays that are looking for any job. All that time while they are looking for a place also to stay, they pass trough lots of bad and good things. They always help and got each other,""I got you, you got me""said George, one of the principal characters, and this shows de people who read this book, that when you have a friend that is passing a bad moment, you have to support him , and that is a good example for children. Also, the main theme of the story is loneliness, this also help people to trie to get lots of friends, for not being alon ein the future. Story statement by Jhon Steinbeck, is a very interesting book for all ages, who wants two know about two gays that pass unforgetable moments and that one of the two lives will end in the ranch, where they finally lived and work."
3,Good and Bad,"I thought this book was good except for the weird ending, Curley's wife dying and Lennie, that was strange."
4,slow mice. fast one gets the cheese,"a book that made me put tear stains on the book.About a big stupid man and a quick sharp-witted guy,looking for a good, happy way to live.Both have ambitions for a farm, except it keeps on slipping away from their grasp.It's great, but I gave it 4 stars.I have a feeling that about 1 out of 3rd of the book are details explaining the world around them.Goes veeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrry slow."
4,Coolio,"'Merica done right--in a righteous book. And now, because I need a few more words to finish the review, blah."
3,Not as good as The Grapes of Wrath,"“Of Mice and Men” tells the story of two friends who wander from ranch to ranch to make money, and hopefully, own their own farm someday. The only Achilles’ heel in this plan is Lenny, a giant of a man with the mind of a child, who tends to get in trouble although he is full of good intentions.“Of Mice and Men” has similar social criticisms to “The Grapes of Wrath”, also written by John Steinbeck. I am aware it was published before “The Grapes of Wrath”, but still I recommend reading “The Grapes of Wrath” which is a better version of “Of Mice and Men.” The plot and characters are more developed, and the message behind it is deeper. In my opinion, “The Grapes of Wrath” is better in every aspect."
3,Jp the koolest kat,"I think the book was an ok book to read if it is for sfa, and you have to read it in a certain amout of time. It is very short and i think it was to easy to read for an 8th grader. It had a lot of swears in it so you can say them out loud in class and you wont get in troble. I think the worst part in the book is when Lennnie dies. I thought Lennie was funny and he did not desevre to die. And i also did not like how the book ended so soon."
3,Kris-Tina A. and Sara W.,"Confusing, yet satisfying, ""Of Mice And Men"" by John Steinbeck offers some depressing surprises. The story revolves around George, a small, well-defined man, and Lennie, a large, mentally retarded man. Together, they run from authorities from ranch to ranch with a quest for a ranch of their own. The theme of this slightly disturbing novel was lonliness. Two other themes of this novel was violence and dreams. Even though it may seem like George doesn't care about Lennie when he verbally abuses him but he really does. Two conficts in the novel are Lennie's petting problem and George's inner problems. Lennie constantly finds trouble and his angelic mind wont let him see why. George can't really help him out of it though, he taught him all he knows. At the end ""Of Mice And Men"" even though it seems horrible, George does what is best for Lennie."
3,"Brilliant Author, Mediocre Novel.....","Let me make a declaration: John Steinbeck was a genius and a brilliant writer; however, with ""Of Mice and Men"" he simply fell short. Although it was extremely well-written in Steinbeck's signature simple style, the novel was just too brief for the plot resolve itself. The resolution seemed forced and rushed. Despite this, Steinbeck did fit in an amazing amount of character development in just over one-hundred pages. I would recommend ""The Grapes of Wrath"" over ""Of Mice and Men."" I would also strongly urge readers to shy away from ""The Red Pony"" and ""The Pearl,"" also by John Steinbeck. READ ""THE GRAPES OF WRATH"" INSTEAD!"
5,A beautiful and compelling novel,"An unforgettable, highly moving story with much to say about love, yearning, and loss. So powerful and affecting, it is a crime that some schools keep the book from teenagers who would undoubtedly find the story hugely important and compelling. The book is a subtle, but very powerful indictment of predjudice and mistreatment of the weak. For that reason alone,the book should be celebrated and taught regularly in our schools. A great classic."
4,Touching and very well written story,"I think this is an excellent story which is very thought provoking. It's a tale of two unlikely partners who are in pursuit of their American dream. The dream ends tragically for many of the characters, who are all very different yet very similar in predicament. I'ts not long, but I'd definitely recommend this book."
1,Over Priced,"Despite being a very well writen work, this ebook is over priced for the length and content. I have a paper copy sitting next to me, and even it is less expensive! I am disappointed."
5,HILARIOUS!,"This book was absolutely hilarious, by far the funniest book i've ever read! It's a barrel of laughs with a new surprise around every corner! I don't like to give away the end of books, but I just can't help myself! The part when they fly to Paris, and that crazy stuardess! I know, I know, i laughed my fanny off! If you're looking for laughs, this is definately it! Enjoy!"
4,Of MIce and Men,The book has great story about how two men with very different personaliltes get along. They travel together trying to earn enough moeny to live out their dream. It shows how no matter what happens they have a friendship which connects them in some way. They have a wonderful frienship and stand by each other. Lennie is not the brightest man and can be a little aggrivating but no matter what George is there to help and protect him.
5,Of Mice and Men,"George and Lennie are best friend. George is a small guy but he has a quick mind and is dark of face. Lennie is a huge man, and has the mind of a young child. They feel lonely. They need each other. they work togeter and begin their dream in the bunkhouse. Those days, some conflicts happen in this little house. And then, George and Lennie need to face these problems.I love this book. The book is great as welll. Because it completely decribes everybody. I can see the hardship of their lives. Sometimes you have no choice. I learned something from this book. What happens in the bunkhouse? How do george and lennie face their problem? You will only find out if You read it! I think you can learn something fromthis book too."
3,"SHORT AND SWEET, BUT BRUTAL","THIS BOOK WAS A CLASSIC, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE A REALLY LONG BOOK TO MAKE A GOOD BOOK THAT STICKS AROUND. THE BOOK IS RIVETING AND SHOWS CHARACTER AND PLOT, ABOUT A MAN WHO IS POOR AND HAS COMMITTED A CRIME BUT THERE IS A QUESTION ON WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD BE HELD RESPNSIBLE BECAUSE HE IS A HALF-WIT AND ALSO HAS BEEN POOR AND MISTREATED DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION"
2,What's the Point?,"I honestly thought that this book by Steinbeck is pointless. It is so short, it really has not plot at all! Yes, it does show the value of friendship, and offers plenty of bookgroup discussion, but I was not thrilled. It really was much too short to go anywhere."
4,"Of mice and men, by John Steinbeck","Of mice and men is written by the nobel prize winner John Steinbeck. It's basicliy about two guys George and Lennie.We neet them in California together on their way to a new job at a ranch. George is the small one and the quick whitted of them, he has promised Lennies aunt to look after him. Lennie is the a big guy, strong as a bull but he is mentally retartded, he's like a kid's head in an adult body. Together they have a dream to own a place where they can live fatta the lan as said in the book and they will have rabbits. Lennie likes animals, espesially small one like rabbits. But he has a strengt he cannot handle, so he ends of killing them.George and Lennie gets a job at the ranch where they meet Slim, Curley, his wife and some ohters. Slim is the ""group leader"" he lokks after everone, Curley is the bosses son, his wife likes boys a lot, Thats what kills George and Lennies dream in the end."
1,Winning the Affiliate Game,It's not even a book. It's a photo copied ringed binder. I was surprised that Amazon marketed this as a ligitimate book published by a real publisher. It is an absolute joke.
3,Mayfair toilet seat hinges defective,Purchased this seat 6 months ago. Love the look and the wood. Put the seat up today and one of the (metal)hinges broke in half. Very surprised at flimsiness of this supposedly quality product. Still want to keep the seat but am having no luck finding new hardware. How can I contact Mayfair products company? Am hopeful they will send me new hardware.
1,JUST SAY NO!!!!!,"This movie is atrocious!! It took away several (or at least FELT like several) hours of my life that I will never ever get back. I really am a Morrissey fan, but this movie makes a mockery of all things Moz - and not in a good way.Don't waste your time with this one. Honestly, the only individuals who might moderately enjoy this film are family members & close friends of those involved in the making of it. The writing is bad & the ""acting"" is even worse. Don't waste your time. I can't say it enough! It's an embarrassment and just AWFUL in every sense of the word. Don't waste your time - SERIOUSLY! I took one for the team on this one. Save yourself!!!"
3,Rent Before You Buy!,"This movie is very low budget and mildly funny throughout. There are a few extra-funny moments. There are NO Smiths or Morrissey songs in this movie and, of course, Morrissey is not in this movie.If you want to buy this movie because you are a big Morrissey fan you should reconsider."
2,Think twice,"I read the reviews before ordering the movie and chose to disregard all the negative feedback and order it anyways. I made a mistake. It isn't the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's pretty close. I wouldn't be as upset about it being bad if I hadn't spent money on it. I am a huge Morrissey fan, and this movie did let me laugh at myself a bit, which was nice. But overall she could have been obsessed with any other star, the movie didn't actually have much to do with Morrissey. If you know someone who owns this movie or can rent it, please do that instead. I don't regret seeing it, but I do regret spending money on it."
1,Rent it before you buy it!,"I'm a big fan of off the wall movies. When I read the reviews I thought this would be a great movie. I really didn't pay attention to the negative ones. The description was interesting and the cover art made it look like this girl was over the top, and would be fun to watch her. It was the WORST movie I have ever seen. It was 30 minutes into the movie before I even laughed, and that was the only laugh of the movie. I was hoping it would just end, it was so STUPID! I waisted my money big time! I've never reviewed any of my past purchases, but after watching this I had to warn people. My only recommendation is try to watch it first before you buy it. I guarantee you won't"
1,Just Plain Bad,"Production quality aside (I allow a little leeway for independent films) this movie was possibly the worst movie I have even seen in my life. After reading other bad reviews I was ready to dismiss them and attempt to enjoy My Life with Morrisey. I am a Smiths fan, but did not care if Morissey was in it or not as long as there was a good storyline to follow. Boy was I wrong. The only thing worse than the script was the acting. That was 125 minutes of my life that I will never have back. Save yourself the time and headache and get a different movie."
4,Handy comp covering the whole of Lydon's career,"Spanning three decades and featuring singles from the Sex Pistols, Public Image Limited, Lydon's post-PiL solo career and a couple of collaborations with other artists, ""The Best of British One Pound Notes"" is a must for any John Lydon fan--particularly if you want to hear the highlights of PiL's spotty later albums. (Yes, this collection is very PiL-intensive, but that's only natural since the group was around from 1978 to 1992, and since they had so many first-rate songs.) Very nice single-disc career retrospective! My only complaint has to do with the edits necessary to fit all this music onto one CD. The ""fools and horses"" verse has been cut from the conclusion of 'Disappointed', one of my all-time favorite PiL songs, and I'm...well, disappointed :( Otherwise, ""Best of British One Pound Notes"" is a pleasure to hear from start to finish."
1,Waste of money,"These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment."
2,Not a Practical Book,"To be honest, I was quite unimpressed with this book. It was a bit interesting, but other than a chapter on being up/down the exchange, it was all things that I may never use in a real game. As well, it didn't provide as many examples of each type of Material unbalance as I'd like, and, though I like Andrew Soltis as an author, his writing wasn't his best here."
5,Perfect for the Corporate Crook in Your Life,My brother is a CEO and this is what I gave him for his birthday! He totally loved it. It is a truly hilarious book.
1,Not funny,I laughed a lot at the description of this book but not even once when reading the real book! All the funny parts were on the cover of the book - nothing left inside.
3,Taffy was ok...,"I would rate this book 1 star if the whole book was like the beginning, and five stars if the whole book was like the end, and the average of 5&1 is 3 so this book is definitely a 3. I liked the saboteur, kidnapping, and rescuing parts the best, and hated the unimportant parts in the beginning."
1,ugh,Hated this movie instantly. It had too much crude humor to be enjoyable. The only good part was the end.
2,The First Fifty Sandler Movies...,"... could be cut and re-edited in arbitrary sequences and nobody would notice. Sandler is the apotheosis of the one-trick pony, the actor who is always exactly the same character in every film. In short, he doesn't act at all; like Yahweh, he just 'is that he is.'Take a look at the expression on the face of Ms Barrymore in the picture on the DVD cover; that's exactly how I look when I find myself watching another Adam Sandler film. Unfortunately, my teenage son and my two twenty-something nieces all find Sandler rib-splitting funny. Being a companionate adult, therefore, I sit cross-legged among them and gape at the screen, forcing a chuckle now and then like a losing presidential candidate at a town meeting. Then sometimes I offer to run out for ice cream...."
3,Very Good,"Very good movie to watch, if nothing else is on. I would advise not to buy this, only if you don't have anything else to do"
2,Rent Groundhog Day instead. . .,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just left me just a little disappointed. Sure, it was a pleasant and cheap way to spend an evening, but it just did not draw me in. Perhaps the humor was just a little to adolescent, and the character development a little to predictable- the potty humor of the Drew Barrymore characters brother was unnecessary and the silly characterization of support characters (i.e., the German lady) was a distractionThe premise, though unlikely, could have been workable; but as I watched it, I could not help but think how much better Groundhog Day covered the same material. So, if you are thinking about a comic romance, skip Fifty First Dates and rent Groundhog day."
4,Quality comedy with heart,"Adam Sandler's previous track record has been shaky, with some underwritten comedies (Anger Management) and movies that failed to find a mainstream audience (Big Daddy). 50 firsts Dates makes an improvement by not only providing an original script that lends itself to both comedic double entrees and depth, courtesy of Drew Barrymore's stunning performance, with convincing pathos. Sandler brings another great character to the screen, especially since this story provokes just as many tears as guffaws. This is possibly Sandler's best film and boasts great comedic turns from Rob Scheider and Sean Astin. This film really does work on all levels, and considering I'm not a fan of the genre. Combining an impressive supporting cast with a sprightly running time and hip soundtrack, and you have one of the best comedies of recent years. Highly reccomended."
5,50 first Dates Blu-ray,I was going to purchase this movie on standard DVD until I bought my PS3. I've seen the movie previously on DVD but after watching it on Blu-ray I am glad I waited to purchase it. The picture quality is so much better than DVD and the sound is so clear. I have fallen in love with Blu-ray since I bought this movie and I plan to buy Blu-ray from now on.
2,Not what I expected.,"I just saw this for the first time today and I must admit, I'm disappointed. I didn't get many laughs from it, I heard it was really funny. To me, this is a recycled version of The Wedding Singer, but it's much, much worse. The Wedding Singer was actually good. Nothing new here."
5,Yusef Komunyaakaa meet your spiritual twin...,"she is angela jackson from woodside california, by way of chicago, by way of woodville mississipi, born from the goddess...her poems speak blues, religion, jazz, down-home cooking, long lasting sugar kisses and journeys by astral travelling. she is a spider walking across the face of history a spook opening her heart to reveal her family secrets...this book is poignant, powerful, sexy, and shows the capabilities of lamguage when placed with someone who has respect for it....very few poetry books have moved me...this one does...."
3,its alright!,"came in the mail today, sprayed it on and its just o.k. came fast and packaging was good, i would use this vendor again!"
5,Deal with the Devil!,Great horror/fantasy movie with Claude Rains and Paul Muni.It's scary and it's funny and it's just a gem. Claude Rainsis awesome as the devil who makes a deal with a bad man whocan come back from the dead. The ending is great as the badman has a change of heart. I love this movie. They don'tand can't make movies like this anymore. I bought a $1 dvdat some place a while back and watch it often. you will too!
3,Should have believed the earlier poor reviews,"I chose this item simply because I felt it would be an upgrade on the expandable basket I normally used in my larger pots to steam a multitude of vegetables such as potatos, ear corn, carrots, many onions,brocoli and sometimes more. The prior Item I owned never left me wanting for additional space to contain the items.This set is visually pleasing to look at, but so small that it came in a box almost half the size of a shoe box. That being said, the internal basket is less than half the allowable space inside the main pot. I'd be lucky to steam more than two or three ears of corn at one time. I'm now dealing with a device that never would have been purchased had it been available for me to look at in a store.In summation, don't expect a sizable item, you will be greatly disappointed."
4,so did you read the DNA report?,"it appears that except Indologist everybody else know how to read mtDNA findings. nowhere in the book I could read the recent breakthrough about the lack of genetic evidence on Aryan invasion and migration. and after concluding that Indus valley had the evidence of fire place, shiva and shakti seals and so on, she then again go back to the imaginary of how European white Aryan descended to the black Dravidian world of Indus valley. if that is how Westerner try to write history of other cultures, I myself being a westerner feel very sorry for my own people. The bottom line is this: do not try to defend something that is indefensible. please start writing all the facts in details, and tell us cleary: what happened to the Indus valley culture? did it disappear or continued as the Vedic culture?"
3,A small contribution to the growing lit. on TBLT,"There are better books - Willis, Skehan, Ellis, Edwards and Willis. I read the original of this book, and the new updated version is definitely better. Nunan a lot of the time when he thinks he's talking about TBL is in fact really talking about PPP. I have read almost everything on TBLT and Nunan in my view is a very minor figure rather than one of the important researchers/writers in this area of methodology. I bet in the future his next article or book won't be on this subject. So based on all the above I give it 3 and say there are better books out there."
2,Book ends at climax=horrible!:<,"I am writing this review based on the words of my 4th grade son. He was really excited to get this book as he thought that it was going to be a great story. His grandparents live in TX and he thought that it would be a lot of fun to read a book that takes place where they live.He breezed through the book and then was SOOOO disappointed at the ending. He said that just as the book was getting more exciting, it just ended. He was really wishing that the author could have solved the mystery of the boy ghost.Hope that our next book is a better one. He said that he would NOT recommend this book to a friend."
1,You GOTTA be kidding!!!,"Okay, I brought this home, looked it over, and IMMEDIATELY took it back. This is supposed to be for a KID, right? I DON'T THINK SO, at least not mine. I purchased it for my 8 yr. old...my 15 yr. old called it ""skanky"" (which I thought was kind). I can't see how any reasonable parent would want this for a child. Skirt is slutty, comes w/ see-thru thong, and is definately inappropriate, even as a gag gift, unless you're shopping for a pedophile."
2,WOW!,"Guessthey weren't kidding when they said ""BIG"" babys!Well,yeah I agree that these dolls don't really sent a good message for kids.But regular barbie dolls are now old and some how...childish.Most of the barbies are pretty much same old ""Princess"" stuff.ANd since sales haven't been doing too well,Mattel has been rushing and making dumb movies.Anyway The doll is really big.It's lips (lIke every other bratz doll)are huge.THe legs of this doll and big and fat.The skirt too short.She seems to have big hips,I rather have the small bratz dolls."
4,'Harmoniom' could be great or flop...,"For Vanessa Carlton fans, this album is a delight. It is musically much stronger than 'Be Not Nobody', and it really showcases Vanessa's playing ability in certain songs. I feel that this album will probably not be as successful as her first release, simply because it is not as marketable from a radio standpoint. It doesn't have as many strong singles as 'Be Not Nobody' because there is more piano and less background music, making it sound more like easy listening than textured, brooding pop. 'White Houses' is a great song, but not nearly as strong of a single as 'A Thousand Miles'. The only reason for four stars is because you have to have a marketable second album if you want to make a third."
2,Vanessa is getting weird,"There are a few mildly catchy songs, but tracks like ""Half A Week Before Winter,"" which mentions vampires, ""She Floats,"" which seemingly tells the tale of a ghost, and ""The Wreckage,"" which make it seem like Vanessa has a death wish, are too disturbing for me. Vanessa almost comes off as a suicidal Goth at times, and that's just weird. This CD is very dark, making it too different from her first album. And there's nothing as catchy and radio-friendly as ""A Thousand Miles."" The melodies are usually upbeat and catchy, but the album seems bittersweet because of its depressing lyrics. I don't like this as much as her debut."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALL,do not buy this product go somewhere else i got mine today and its horrible i wasted money on a stupid bootleg version go to another site or something the bootleg version in the picture it the one you get im writing this so nobody else wastes there money and time for nothing
1,Bootleg Headband,"This headband sucks!! its not the official one. Its too small for my head. Its supposed to be blue, not black. I'm currently using it as a collar for my dog and thats the only cool thing about it. I'm trying to find a real one in time for this costume party im going to. Plz help!"
5,awesome,"I'm what you call a narutard, this version of sasukes anti leaf headband is awesome. I sort of expected to receive a cruddy metal with cloth flimsily attatched, but it was bolted to the cloth, the cloth was durable and tough, the metal was the real steel, and it bent wherever I wanted it to... definately buy from this seller"
5,perfect,fits great looks great had no problems with it at all i would recommend anyone buying this for crossplay its ligit
3,"Dated, but okay","I learned some adequate skills by watching the guys in ""short shorts"" with ""Eye of the Tiger"" music. After all, the art of attacking and defending doesn't change so much that you need modern music or kits. The breakdown of what's happening in each late 80s game really does explain how the player is responding in a game situation. However, the aforementioned attire/soundtrack makes it hard to shake the feeling that I'm learning an outdated style."
5,Cant stop playing!,"what can i say this album rocks...i mean it may not be American Idol but it is Clay!...who could hate this album...especially with songs like ""The Way"" and ""Touch""...I really wonder who would hate that this album."
5,Great Debut,"Clay is off to a great start. His voice really comes through and the album is well produced. Lots of catchy songs from a vocalist who can really belt them out. His future should be very bright. A few too many love songs, but that's a minor complaint because each song has it's own personality and they're not as mellow as I thought they would be. My favorite tunes are Invisible, I Will Carry You, No More Sad Songs, Perfect Day and Touch. As you can see, that's about half the CD. Well done Clay."
3,Clay needs a new Producer and Song Writer,"What a dissapointment. The songs were over-produced. You can barely hear Clay sing. In an effort to make his style more ""pop"" they have lost the characteristics that made Clay so great. Honestly, I wouldn't have even known it was him singing. Plus, all the songs sound the same. He really needs a new writer. I heard Invisible live and it was great. On the cd it is ok. I thought ""Invisible, The Way, No More Sad Songs, This is the Night and Perfect Day"" had potential. Lets here Clay sing something more upbeat like ""Build me up Buttercup"". Too much like Christain Rock for me! Hoping for something better next time. Clay is worth so much more than this!"
5,Could Not Ask For More,"Don't know what ""Dork Rock"" is coming from, a lot of the comments weren't even about the CD! I think this is a fantastic CD as do a lot of my peers, young and old. It really is a CD for everyone. Clay's voice is wonderful, he has a lot of range and there isn't a bad song on his CD. Usually, when I buy a CD, I have one or maybe, two tracks that I really like, but this CD doesn't have just one or two, they are all great!!! Definitely worth buying and listening to!"
1,I love the way I wisper your name when I'm asleep,"Does this guy tape record himself at night? For more grade school poetry, nonsensical statements, and Haiku's written by dumb people go out and get this CD ASAP."
4,Give us back the real voice of Clay Aiken,"I am a huge fan of Clay Aiken and his beautiful natural voice.After listening to Clay's new Cd I was disappointed.Not in Clay but what the mixers and engineers did to his voice.I wasn't sure it was Clay. I love the songs that were chosen for Clay to sing like Touch,Shine,The Way and I Will Carry You.All The songs on the Cd had very powerful words and great music.But lacked Clay's powerful voice.Maybe Clay's next Cd will be in his orginal voice."
1,Why won't amazon post my review,"I wonder why Amazon will not post my review of this album. I loved clay on american idol - but he lost get over it. This album is average at best. Stop pushing him as though he won. Reuben is the winner and Clay's ""Measure of a Man"" does not measure up to Reuben's ""Soulful""."
2,Yawn.....,"Don't get me wrong. Clay can really sing. His voice is good enough, but his music is just so corny and boring. All ballads and wanna be broadway sounding songs. I can't even bear to listen. I only do it to figure out what all the furor is about. I still haven't. Save yourself the effort."
1,schmalz,"In the new edition of webster's they should stick a photo of this to define ""schmalz"". Oh my god, is this what our music culture has devolved to?. This album was inflicted on me as I was in Border's the other day. I left without buying anything, which is unusual for me. By the way, cats are wonderful creatures."
5,clay proves his greatness again,wow. just wow. clay has proven his greatness once again. his voice is just so powerful you just fall in love. you can play this cd for hours and it never tires. i love it. no words can express how wonderful it is.
5,magnifiscent !! a must have in any CD collection,"For anyone who appreciates good music these days this CD is a must have. It is easy to listen to , timeless, classic and Clay Aikens voice is truly something special after a long time.it is not overproduced , and all the songs included are catchy and listenable. My favourites are measure of a man , the way, i survived you, . i have listened to this CD over and over again and still not sick of it.it is finally a CD where i love all the songs included and dont haveto skip any.Clay keeps the fans of pop,country,rock, ballad happy. it was no coincidence he won the Fans choice american music award.For anyone who has not had the pleasure of hearing this amazing voice, this collection is a must."
1,AMAZING!!,"It's AMAZING how horrible this CD is. The truth needs to be told, and the other reviews for this CD up to this point are very misleading. Clay has talent for sure. It takes talent to dupe all of America into thinking you have a wonderful voice. Clay, I love you, you're my homey, but for God's sake.. stop making music. Or at least release it independently so we don't have to see and hear this CD everywhere we go. The first two tracks are disappointing. Three and four are boring, and the rest are just plain gut-wrenchingly awful. I'm sorry for all you Clay fans out there that will have problems with what I'm saying but please be honest with yourselves and boycott Aiken."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,ALTHOUGH I AM AFAN OF CLAYS I DID NOT THINK THAT THE ALBUM WAS ANYTHING SPECIAL. THE BACKGROUND MUSIC SEEMED OUT OF SYNC WITH HIS VOICE
3,Achin' for the real Clay,"Frustration sums up my feelings about Clay Aiken's cd debut. Many of the qualities that made all of us jump on the ""Clay Bandwagon"" during American Idol are missing here. The music is polished and clean, too clean. Gone are the vulnerable moments and the ""surprise"" elements of his songs. The lyrics are insipid. This is elevator music, ""Musak"". I wish that Neil Sedaka had produced this album. Then we would have all enjoyed Clay's version of ""Solitaire"", done only as Clay can do. I do not fault Clay with this. The blame rest solely on the songwriters and producers of this Cd. Let's hope Clay's ""sophomore"" effort allows him to be himself, the Clay that earned him all our votes."
5,BEST MUSIC CD IN YEARS,THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST CD I'VE BOUGHT IN YEARS!!! EVERY SONG IS BURSTING WITH CLAY'S ENERGY AND SPECTACULAR VOICE. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM SING THEM IN PERSON! HE WAS DEFINITELY THE BEST ON AMERICAN IDOL 2. THE STRENGTH OF HIS VOICE WILL CARRY HIM A LONG WAY. EVERY SONG TOUCHED ME!
3,Disappointing,"Clay was so much better on Amercinal Idol. This CD is good, but not even close to what I was expecting given how he performed on TV. Hopefully, this album was a compromise with record execs and he'll be able to really impress us on his next album."
1,what.................. he wont be big,ok clay has a good vocie but come on hes ugly in the songs are the same'ol pop songs just think of him as another ruben good vocie but to ugly but one thing ruben can sing better in is a real singer with good song but clay sucks big time he wont be big so trust me on this one i know music in i know when i say this cd ant worth it dont buy it ant worth the money theres not even one good song on this cd this whole cd sucks so DONT BUY IT
1,Very bland,"I am a big fan of pop music among other genres but this album lacks a personality. Sort of like being stuck in a time warp and transported back to the late 90s. The songs just seem to blend together. It also appears as if Mr. Aiken is not too invested in his on product, he seems very detached from the songs.I also found the album overproduced. It lacks oomph and edge, in other words, I found it boring."
1,california,"I am highly entertained not by this horrible music but by the marketing scam perpetrated on the music buying public over and over. Tell them it's good, a thousnad times, and they will buy anything. It is an admirable thing to see Clive Davis become even more wealthy by pumping out more and more drivel for the masses to consume. A good clue to the quality of the five star reviews for this release can be found by the list of music purchases made by those who bought this CD:* CDs from The American Idol Series* Closer ~ Josh Groban* The Movie Album ~ Barbra Streisand* Bette Midler Sings The Rosemary Clooney Songbook ~ Bette Midler* One Heart ~ Celine Dion* The Very Best Of Cher ~ Cher* Buddy Jewell ~ Buddy Jewell* Michael Buble [ENHANCED] ~ Michael BubleIf lack of taste were a crime, all involved with this release would be in jail."
2,Disappointing,"The majority of the songs on this album are very poorly written; borderline cheesy.Although Clay's voice has improved even further since winning runner up on American Idol, these songs do not do his voice justice.""Invisible"" is the strongest song on the album and is very catchy, but the album just nose dives after the 1st song.Being a huge fan of American Idol, I am extremely disappointed in Clay's debut album. His sales may end up being higher than Kelly Clarkson's or Justin Guarini's, but out of the 3, I'd have to say that Kelly is still American Idol's golden child.I'll pass Clay's cd onto someone else and keep Kelly's in my cd player. Too bad that Clay didn't receive the same quality of songs as Kelly did. Now I can only cross my fingers and hope that Ruben & Tamyra will not have an album full of poorly written songs like Clay and Justin have."
5,Measure of a Man - I Love Every Single Track!,"It's hard to believe that a debut album could be this terrific! This is the first time I've listened to a CD and have no desire to skip a single track. I love every one of them and each day I have a new favorite. At first my favorite was 'No More Sad Song' (his voice just sounds so rich on that song) then it was 'Perfect Day' (another wonderful showcase for his beautiful voice) then it was 'Touch' (one of the most poetic and sensual songs I've ever heard; if you use your imagination while you listen to that song, you will drive yourself crazy) and today my favorite is 'The Way' (I think this could become a Number 1 song for weeks, maybe months!). The title track is really growing on me, too. Clay Aiken is, simply, PERFECTION! (My apologies to Neil Sedaka for stealing his description of Clay Aiken.)"
4,Fabulous Voice,"Love this album. Didn't give it a full 5 stars only because the songs are a little weak - However, they grow on you and Clay's voice is wonderful. So nice to hear an artist who does not need technology to make him sound better. Must say, I like all of the songs, which is unusual for any album no matter how good the artist. Have not stopped playing the album and can't wait to see him get some really good material to show what he can do. My favorite is The Way."
5,5+++++++ Stars!,"Wow, I am extremely impressed!!! Clay Aiken's voice is just amazing. I adore the songs ""Invisible"" and ""No More Sad Songs"". I want Clay to put out a Christmas CD and a Christian CD next. I am buying a ton of these for gifts - go Clay!!!"
5,"13-Year old that's ""Aiken for Clay""","Clay Aiken's Measure of a Man is extraordinary. It has a little bit of everything in it. When I first heard Invisible, it sounded a bit stalkeresque to me. But the music & lyrics really makes you want to sing along. 'When You Say You Love Me' sounds country to me, as well as other songs. A lot of his songs are about getting over someone, so I get them mixed up often. The beat of 'No More Sad Songs' is really good, it sounds pretty different from the rest of the album. I already got tired of 'This is the Night', although it brought back a lot of American Idol memories. 'Measure of a Man' is extremely well-written, and I love to sing along to it! 'Touch' is the flip-side of the album. It's a bit seductive, but the music is amazing. Overall, it's a really good CD if you like Clay Aiken."
3,"All right, but...","This CD was ok - Clay has a great voice, but the album sounded overproduced and all of the songs sounded very similar to me. I didn't think it showed off his range and the magnitude of his voice very well. Probably the biggest problem, though, is that I bought this and Josh Groban's Closer CD at the same time. Poor Clay can't compete with Josh for time in my CD player..."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"In watching Clay on TV, I was in hopes of great things from him in his first CD. It was VERY vanilla! Nothing spectacular...or stretching. I think he played it safe and I was hoping it sounded a bit better. I won't purchase it. I borrowed the CD from a friend and decided not to buy it. I think you'll be disappointed if you purchase this CD."
1,"Great Singer, Wrong Material","The Clive Davis churned out anothere same ol', same ol'...like what David Foster did to Josh Groban....great voices with little to do. The singer can be great but if the material is mostly wrong...oh, well....I will hope for better next time!"
4,What is the deal with No More Sad Songs?,"Okay, I only searched through 100 reviews to see if anyone mentioned No More Sad Songs, and very few did. So, let me say that it is by far the best song on the album and frankly, worth the price of the entire album. Of course, I like the other songs, too, but I'm shocked more people haven't said glowing things about No More Sad Songs. Then again, I don't typically like the pop music of the last 2 decades -- I probably can't name one song on the Top 40. So, my tastes are probably unusual.I was hoping Clay would do some covers like during AI. His versions of To Love Someboday, Sugar Pie Honey Bunch, and Here There and Everywhere were absolutely amazing. Clay's AI performances were the only performances by anyone that have ever reminded me of Elvis (though he doesn't dance much like him : )."
2,A disapointed debut album,"I've anticipated this cd for some time and must say it is not what I had expected it to be. I thought it would contain more ballads, lite pop and broadway songs, which he performed on American Idol. This cd is very boring, everything sounds alike. Clay has great range but the music Clive Davis selected for his first cd does not show the versatility shown on American Idol. I still believe Clay is Broadway, not this run of the mill type music."
2,Disappointing debut from a very talented young man,"I agree with the other reviews that Clay Aiken has one of the most beautiful voices in music today. But I am disappointed in his new album. He has been interviewed many times saying ""I sing from my heart about things that move me,"" yet, it seems as if every song sounds the same. I blame this on poor writing on and not on the vocalist himself. I am a HUGE Clay supporter and rooted for him throughout the entire American Idol competition, but I must say, this album does nothing for me. After hearing ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" I was expecting to be really WOWED by his debut album... I am bummed out this one didn't stack up to his single. I am surprised there are so many people impressed by this CD... I can't help but wonder what song I'm listening to when every track sounds like the same ol' same ol' to me."
3,"#2 in American Idol, #1 CD for sure!","This Cd has a wonderful range of beautiful songs from Clay Aiken. His voice is magnetic! You can listen for hours and hours and never get tired of his beautiful voice and sweet music!Hey, there's got to be something to it if my mom loves it as much as I do!"
5,Wonderful CD.,"I have waited patiently for this first CD from Clay Aiken and now that I have it - I am extremely pleased. The more I listen to it, the more I love it. My favourite songs change daily but at the moment they are - I Survived You; No More Sad Songs; Invisible and I Will Carry You.Well done Clay."
5,Amazing,I usually have one or two songs that I skip on each cd. I love all of the songs on this cd. What else can I say? His voice is so pure. I reccommend this cd to people of all ages.
5,OUTSTANDING,"The CD shows Clay's range. I especially liked Run to Me, I Survived You, Perfect Day, Measure of a Man, well, the whole thing. His lower register is so smooth. He has a great voice and has proven it time and time again. I would like to see him come out with a Christmas CD."
1,cd up for trash,tried to listen to it again to give it a chance. still it sounded as disgusting as the first try.my only advice to Clay now is to make sure he completes his college degree soonest cos he may be back sooner teaching than he expects.i also wish him all the luck in his future endeavors.i know he has already lost several fans who can tell good music from bad.
2,clay still second best,"clay aiken is not only a very bad role model and icon, but i don't think he can reach to the stasis of ruben studdard. this album had only 1 song that i liked, invincible. clay aiken could be more upbeat."
5,Excellant,I was very surprised at how good an album this is. This album is full of great pop songs. Billboard was right when it said this was the best pop album of 2003. I guess my favorite songs are Perfect Day and Invisible. They are all very good songs with very good melodies.
5,They said he couldn't do pop...,"... well he did... and it works! I didn't see much of either AI, but when I heard this guy's voice! WOW! I took notice and was anxious to hear the CD. I was surprised at the total pop/contemporary sound and impressed at how well he carried it off. While I could listen to his huge voice singing Bridge Over Troubled Waters all day long, I'm glad his album wasn't full of a bunch of old remakes, mainly because in this album he proved he could do more. Had the songs been from AI, he would have then been accused of karaoke and over-singing. This album is full of new songs (new to most of the population anyway) that get better each time you hear them and that after a few listens, you can't stop singing them. The future of Clay Aiken will be an exciting and different one to watch!"
1,SO Disappointing,"A great voice impeded by dreadful songs, most written by a committee (it seems) and humdrum orchestration. Clay, please listen to GREAT songs by the master songwriters -- Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, so many others. You have the voice. Please find the music."
1,"One Extended, Boring Song",Clay said he's not an artist and he's absolutely correct. This CD is so unbelievably over hyped for a worthless collection of mediocre pop tunes sung by a mediocre singer who could not put emotion into a song if his life depended on it.Total manufactured crap.
1,Woohooo Bland Ballads,"Clay has a horrible voice (sorry obsessed Claymates,it's true) and this cd proves it. All the songs are generic and unoriginal, he brings nothing new to the music industry. His voice is so irritating and grating. A year from now (or not even) he will be forgotten."
2,What happened?,"Clay knocked my socks off on American Idol, and I will always believe that he should have won. His interpretations of familiar pop tunes and standards were awesome. That's why the CD was disappointing. Comprised of unfamiliar tunes, and without his exciting stage presence, this CD is completely unremarkable. I'm sure it was popular with the teenyboppers (the CD includes a mini-poster), but his fan base is much, much broader. Clay, if you're reading, we'd like to hear more of your unique interpretations of familiar music. Pick a decade, pick an era, pick a genre. You have the potential to be a icon and not just an idol, but it won't happen with stuff like this,"
5,Awesome. Simply Awesome.,Clay should have won American Idol. Everyone knows that. This cd will kill the sales of Ruben's cd. I hope this cd is still in the top 5 when Ruben's cd comes out. Go Clay. You are a true American Idol.
5,Year of the Clay,"We found a new idol and he just turns out to be one of the coolest and smartest guy around. An amazing voice, such charisma and feeling in his tone....He's the best. Love you Clay."
5,I love Clay!!,This CD was an absolute joy and I'm so very glad I bought it. I never watched American Idol and somehow I keep thinking he's the winner because I see more of him than the other guy. I love his voice and the songs on this CD are excellent.
5,CLAY FAN FROM MIAMI,THIS IF FOR THE MUSIC FAN FROM WASHINGTON STATEIF ANYONE HAS POOPY FOR BRAINS IT IS YOU.MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICEABOUT SOMEBODY DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.CLAY HAS A GREAT VOICE AND A WONDERFUL CD AND IS A NICERESPECTUL PERSON - YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM HIM.
5,Clay's Wonderful Voice,I love hearing Clay sing anything. This album brings out a remarkable range of emotions. His voice is beautiful in every song. The songs are interesting and Clay's voice captures the listener the moment the songs begin. I hope this is the beginning of many more albums for Clay. I would like to see him continue to experiment and still stay true to who he is. I highly recommend purchasing this CD.
1,The End of Music,"The entire concept is just bad. I don't care how much this guy whines about his hard life, he's not deserving. He is wasting tons of record label space that could be occupied by true, creative, artists. The whole idea of a country picking the next big pop star from a TV show is just sad. It's a shame children will grow up thinking this is good. Radio is forever gone, hang the DJ.JB"
2,Broadway Clay,"I still do not understand how this guy is getting more attention than the winner of AI, but that said, how can anyone listen to this CD and not think that he has a voice for Broadway and only Broadway. He punctuates every single syllable, lighten up Clay!The music on the CD is catchy, but the voice behind the music is just plain annoying."
5,America's Choice,"Clayton has hit a homerun with his debut CD, Measure of a Man! What an outstanding voice and what a refreshing change in themusic industry. Finally, someone has come along to sing the songs that we can listen to with our children, and not be ashamed at what they might hear. Finally, an artist who is not afraid to stand up to the record producers and lets them know that he will not record anything that he wouldn't want his own children to hear. Finally, a musical CD that we can sing along with. Thank you, Clayton for an outstanding CD!"
5,Definitely 2003s Biggest New Talent,With 2003 came the angelic voice of a pure raw talent. This southern crooner can definitely move your heart and soul with every word he sings. I have loved music all my life including a little of everything from the 60s clear to now and no one can move me over and over again like Clay Aiken. He has proven that music can span across all boundaries to join fans both young and old alike. If you have not yet bought this album it is a definite must have for any music collection.
5,Greatest Male Vocalist Of All Time,"I highly anticipated this album and and was pleased, but not suprised to find it refreshing and moving. Clay Aiken delivers his songs with emotion and beauty leaving the listener wanting more. This album will not disappoint. I bought 2!"
5,Silver lining in a dark cloud of top 40 music in 2003.,"In my opinion, there really hasn't been a top 40 artist who has stood out this year (besides 3DD with ""Here without You""). I heard AI Clay Aiken's hit single ""Invisible"" and this has been one of the better hit songs of the year. I would recommend this CD if you are for easy listening."
5,Measure of a Man,"I ordered this album 3 months ago (it was just released today, Oct 14 and it is being sent now) but I couldn't wait so I went and bought one today.It was worth waiting for!! Every song in it is CLAY. Of course I have my favorites but I'll let you choose yours.Buy it now. You won't be sorry."
5,This guy measures up!,"I bought this CD for my 12yr old daughter who is a big fan of Clay Aiken, and I have to say that I'm hooked as well! How refreshing it is to hear a performer that isn't a pig..., foul,violent, druggie or has sold out to the recording mecca's! Easily the best new artist I have heard in years,Clay's ""Measure Of A Man"" delivers and you won't be dissapointed. I personally have listened to the CD a dozen times, and ALL the songs are well done.I honestly like all the songs,[many give me chills with that voice] and feel many of the cuts could be big hits. This CD is probably destined for greatness. I will buy this guys stuff from now on, he is an impressive young man on and off the stage, and I'm pround to say he's a good example for young people today..."
4,Measure of a Man,Fabulous CD for first timer Clay Aiken. Incredible voice and music will appeal to all age crowd. Congratulations Clay.....you deserve the best!!!
5,It's All Good,"When was the last time you bought a CD and loved every single song? This is a CD that will definately please anyone who listens to it. Each day my favorite track changes. Easy to listen to, emotional lyrics, and upbeat songs- this CD has it all. I'll be listening to this for a long time."
1,Worst recording to come along,"in a long time.This has got to be a joke. Please don't wasteyour money on this CD. It's not all what somereviewers on here are saying it is. They areobviously Clay's fans trying to convince the worldthat he has a golden voice. The guy can sing, butbelieve me so can a lot of people. He released thisthing too soon and should have selected better songsto sing. Measure of a man just doesn't do it for me.Sorry Clay, this one flopped."
1,Too syrupy,Reminds me of buble gum pop too much. I hate it. It was one ofthe worse cds ever. I am gonna sell it and get my money back.
4,"a music lover from rochester, ny","This CD was great. Every Clay fan should own it. In my opinion, the best songs on the CD are ""Invisible"", ""When You Say You Love Me"" & ""This Is The Night"". However, every song is great. He has a great pop sound that is very ""radio-friendly"" with that great ""pop hook"" and will appeal to most pop lovers. This CD will surely go straight to the top of the charts!"
5,Awesome CD,"Honestly the guy can sing. Out of 12 songs, I would say more than half are excellent, and the others are worth listening too. Most cd's have 2-4 decent songs out of 12-15, however this one tops them all. If you think the cd could be better, I disagree. Everyhting in life could always be better, you cant change that. As a first Clay Aiken Deput album...?? well It Rocks. Worth every penny."
5,A CD that you never need the skip button to enjoy,"Track after glorious track, Mr. Aiken allows us into his soul and spreads joy through our hearts. His voice is truly blessed. Listen to this CD and just try not to sing along and smile."
1,Disappointed - sorry,"I went mad for this guy during the American Idol trials! Sat down and watched and cheered each week; all excited when the album came out and more importantly arrived in Ireland! But when I listened to it; he didn't sound at all like he did in American Idol.I think his song choices on this album left a lot to be desired. Where were all the brilliant songs he sang on the American Idol show? That's what I wanted to hear, that's what I would WANT to hear if I went to see him live in concert.But other than that, I wish him well and hope he takes note of this!"
2,Not What I Expected!!,"I waited in anticipation for the release of this album. I think it's awful with the exception of two tracks - ""Measure of A Man"" and ""This is the Night"". The background music is far too loud and drowns out Clay most of the time. It sounds like he is shouting to be heard above the music. The wonderful voice we heard on ""American Idol"" is certainly not evident on this CD. The lack of ballads is disappointing - he's certainly not cut out to be the next rock star - please don't try to portray him as such."
4,It TOUCHED me!,"I'm not a fan of pop music particularly but I bought the CD because of Aiken's voice and personality. The highest compliment I can pay is that after repeated listenings, I still enjoy it. My biggest complaint is that I think the CD's over-produced (I like the live bootleg version of ""Invisible"" better than the CD, e.g.) But, overall, it's catchy and fun and I find myself humming a lot of the tunes through the day. I don't understand why it's not getting more radio play. My favorite track is ""Touch."" Clay sounds like a G-version George Michael. Ooh baby!"
1,Ridiculous effort,Clay Aiken needs to take a seat. His 15 minutes of fame has ended and it's a wrap for him. He should stick to doing broadway tunes and not Pop. His album is a sad attempt and i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone... not even my worst enemy.
1,SUCKED,"Pointless CD unless u like badly sung ballads that have no meaning worst thing everdo not be persuaded by these ""claymate"" people they are biased and know that clay does infact stink they just can't except it if u know wats good for u STAY AWAY FROM ""MEASURE OF A MAN"""
5,Great First CD,"Clay's voice is amazing, as usual. The CD contains ""radio-friendly"" songs, as well as ballads that AI fans will expect (a tough balance to achieve). It is nearly impossible to please everyone, without alienating someone, but this CD comes about as close as any I have ever heard. It is a great CD and I would recommend it to anyone. I look forward to many more Clay Aiken CDs in the future."
1,wow what a bomb,i am sorry to say that this album really changed my opinion of clay aiken. This album is horrible and if you want to know why there are so many used copys available to buy you'll know after listening to this. I want Ruben Studdard
4,Clay's voice shines through,"Reading the reviews it seems that many are based on the like or dislike of Clay or the continuation of a Ruben/Clay competition. Get over it! Ruben won the AI contest, they are both talented singers and their styles are different. That said, my critique of the album is that the songs are a little weak, overly orchestrated in some cases and some hokey instrumentals in other cases. Clay's voice, however, shines through and overcomes the weak material and the little time that was taken to put the album together. If you are sentimental and romantic at heart, like ballads, like to sing along, love Clays voice ... or any of the above, you will like this album. It just makes you feel good. Despite its shortcomings, I couldn't give it less than 4 stars since I love it and listen to it at least once a day. My favorite is The Way co written by Enrique Iglesias and hopefully we'll see some more like this on the next album ... stronger songs to match the depth of Clay's voice."
5,clay is a true measure of a man,"Clay's first CD is actually very good. It is not the raw voice that all of us Clay fans expected from the american idol performances but, it is of a more experienced Clay. His voice range is incredible and the music is soft and beautiful. It is not surprising that this CD has gone double platinum in one week. The fans really appreciate his talent. This young man is going to be around for a long time. This CD is the blossoming of a living legend."
5,I'M IN LOVE WITH CLAY'S VOICE!!!,"I think this CD is Fantastic! To the person from Charlotte, who said there was no emotion in the songs, what CD were you listening to? Certainly not Measure of A Man!! I feel the emotion in every song and DO feel like he is singing to me. It's been a long time since I have listened to a CD that touched my heart and soul as much as this one. I am sooooo in love with his voice!!!"
5,The Only American Idol worth listening to,"This album will not disappoint. I am not a big fan of Clay Aiken but I ended up enjoying the album; you will never hear more beautiful songs as softly sung by him. He sings in a voice that is smooth, mature- and he can really soar when he wants. This is a great ""feel good""album!"
3,Sweet but subdued,"I listened to the entire CD today and kept waiting for that big voice to come belting out, the way it did on Clay's performances of ""Bridge"" or ""Somewhere Out There"" on the show. All of the tracks on this debut were well done, definitely a pop record. The collection didn't blow me away like Kelly's did last year, but I liked the title track as well as ""Invisible"" (which he sang in the concert). If Clay ever makes it to Broadway and is able to use his voice to its full volume and emotion, I think he will blow the audiences away."
3,upsetting,"I was very surprised about the poor quality for the CD. Clay's voice is awesome but many of the songs lack some...umph. The songs Invisible and Measure Of A Man have grown on me but I believe that the lyrics and music on most of the CD is poor quality. I am hoping that Neil Sedekah will write a CD for Clay really soon, to show off the AMAZING voice that Clay has."
5,Addictive,"I can't get enough of this CD. I am a BIG Clay Aiken fan, so I was prepared to like it. But, even with my favorite performers there are always songs I love and songs I skip over. Well, on this CD I don't skip over any songs! They are all incredible. He makes you feel like he is singing directly to you! His voice is masterful and knowing a bit about the person behind the music makes one like him even more! I had to buy two to have one in my car and one in my purse (in my portable cd player)! I can't wait until the next one!"
4,Clay's voice is amazing.,"When I first listened to Clay's album it didn't really grab me, but it was in my cd player and I kept listening to it and it got better and better each time. His voice is absolutly amazing, I could listen to him sing forever. It amazes me at how much talent he has. If you liked him on American Idol you'll definately enjoy this album."
5,Measure of a Man........the best CD ever!,"I highly recommend this CD, Clay's voice is amazing. I'm so glad he is finally getting the recognition he deserves. My favorite song is ""Measure of a Man"" but they are all wonderful. Add this CD to your collection you won't be sorry and you'll forever be a fan!"
3,Overproduced,"Yes, Clay is an awesome singer, but coming from a show where the contestants sung songs that actually showcased their voices, I was disappointed in this album. Why does everything have to sound popish? The music drowns out Clay's voice on the majority of the cd. And the little ""rawness"" that Clay had on the show has been toned down and smoothed out. I think those qualities were part of why I love his singing so much. The cd is nice, but I hope he can last long enough to release another cd, one where more of his vocal talent can actually be heard and appreciated."
3,disappointed,"I love Clay's voice, but on the CD I was looking forward to the style he portrayed on the show. I was very disappointed that it was all pop music, when his voice comes through the best with ballads and soulful songs like he did on the show. Yes, his voice sounds good still, but the CD is nothing special as it sounds like any other male pop singer. You can't hear the bits of his accent as he sings. The whole CD through i was just hoping for more of his old style."
5,VERY PLEASED!!!,"I am surprised by what bad reviews Clay has received here. I purchased the CD today and have played it twice now. I am quite satisfied.You know it's a great song if on the first play you find yourself wanting to play it over again. Although I can't say all of these tracks made me feel this way, a few did. These were, ""Invisible,"" I Will Carry You,"" ""When You Say You Love Me,"" ""I Survived You"" and of course ""This Is The Night.""I enjoyed all tracks. It's hard to find a CD that you can actually say that about! Though I have one complaint.. the track titled ""No More Sad Song!"" I don't know maybe it's not such a bad song, and even though I don't have a problem with Elton John, just being reminded of Elton's song ""Sad Songs"" made me want to scream! God I hate that song!!! (Sorry fans of that song.)I know it's not the same song that clay is singing... I just don't like the title!Overall, 12 tracks and only just the one I couldn't stand to hear, just based on Elton Johns song..."
3,A solid debut,"This album is a good way to start a recording career, but it's not the best pop album of the year. It's not full of hits, maybe a couple. The best chance is with ""The Way"". There are a couple of low points too as with ""I Survived You"" The lyrics in that one are on the silly side with words like ""You wrote me off like I was doomed"". His voice carries the album well even with some subpar songwriting. I don't know where people are getting double platinum from. The album sold a little over 600,000 copies in it's first week to debut at number one. It will be platinum soon."
2,Barry Manilow meets Neal Diamond,"This is a huge diappointment. The producers of this CD should be publicly flogged. Clay's fans love his strong, booming voice and ability to pound out ballads. You'll hear NONE of that on this CD. I am amazed that producers with decades of experience wouldn't understand that fans want to hear the full range of Clay's voice. Instead, what you will hear are a bunch of sappy, run of the mill pop tunes that will uninspire. Save your money and buy some old Barry Manilow cd's. At least you'll get what you are paying for. Let's hope, on his next CD, that Clay is allowed to sing the way we all know that he can."
2,Doesn't do it.,"I've honestly heard this entire album, I'm glad that I didn't buy it. Everything sounds almost the same and I find myself getting bored with his voice. I'm a big fan of everyone on AI, so I listen to every song first before I judge. I would say Kelly Clarkson and Ruben Studdard's CD's are better than this. Please, do yourself a favor and buy those instead, not this. I would recommend maybe downloading some of Clay's songs, but don't spend your money."
2,Rather Boring,Living in Australia we are in the middle of our first series of Australian Idol so I was very curious as to what Clay Aiken actually sounded like so brought this CD. I found the majority of the CD rather boring. I do already own both Kelly and Justins CD's both of which I find alot more entertaining than Clays.Clay's CD seems very radio friendly and MORish which I spose alot of people would like but I found that maybe I needed the Hype of American Idol II to enjoy him more.
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"This is an amazing work. His album is full of songs that are full of substance, you can relate to them and he sings them very meaningfully. I Will Carry You is a fabulous song.Well done!"
4,Great Debut,"This man's voice is even better than I remember it from the show. Some of the material is a little trite, but Clay's soaring voice and interpretation make it rise above the fray. Clay paints his lyrics for the listener - committing to every word. I really enjoyed the simplicity, albeit, Christian overtones of Measure of a Man, the confidence in Run to Me and for some reason, I can't get I Will Follow You out of my head. If this were the 80's or 90's, he'd easily have 3 or 4 solid singles from this album. Sadly, non-melodic rap music has driven more soothing sounds from the radio. Let's hoping some radio stations are willing to take a chance on Clay....."
5,Simply Awesome,Clay was my favorite male of the second Idol serious from the word go. I have looked forward to this CD forever and I was not let down!!! It is really good!!!
3,Clay Aiken,"Personally I dont know what all the fuss is about, Clay Aiken is average at best, which is why I gave him a 3, all the American Idol singers are average because its something they are trying to learn how to do. Music Artists have to have it in them from the beginning like Mariah, or Whitney or even Justin Timberlake, its something theyve always wanted to do and thats what sets them apart from all the rest, including Clay. I will say one thing good about him for all his fans, ""The Way"" is the best song on the album, and he should have done it more Country and he would be sitting at #1 on the Charts. Record sales mean little actually if they only play your music on elevator radio stations! Can you say Flash in the Pan!!!"
1,Please tell me this is a joke.,You've got to be kidding me. I've got a 12 year old brother that can sing really loud and smile a lot. Can he get a record deal? Straight to the top of the list as WORST RECORD OF THE YEAR.
1,It sucks!,"Clay has an incredible beautiful voice, but the song selections are annoyingly boring! I found myself skipping each sound alike song until I reached the start of the CD...I want my money back. Clay, your CD sucks"
5,HE's So CUTE!!!,"His singing is ok, and the songs are not my style, but the four stars are for his looks, oowww!!!"
5,GREAT CD by CLAY AIKEN!!!!!,"I truly love this entire album, beautifully done! I love all of the songs so much! If I had to choose a favorite it would be THE WAY, my goodness, so darn romantic!!! WOW, then I would say touch, WOW, talk about GREAT MUSIC!!! Thank you Clay for making such a wonderful album my entire family can listen to, and my kids can dance to!"
2,"Clay, buddy what happened?","Yuk! is about all I can say. I loved Clay on the show but this cd sounds like one 50 min track. Save your money and get a copy used if you must. They are here for $4. If you bought This Is The Night/Bridge cd single, then you got the best. These people saying Amazing! 5 stars! must be with the Arista marketing team. They must be getting paid to log on reviews. Clay is great and Clay can sing, but this cd has three good tracks."
5,Clay Aiken - God Given Talent,"This CD is fabulous! I cannot say enough kind things about his music or him as a person. The song choices are perfect for his vocal range. He gives me goose bumps, his voice is so intense. If you like Adult Contemporary music, then you will love this CD. Since I purchased it, October 14, 2003, I have listened to it everyday at work for the entire 8 hour day. Co-workers have asked me what I'm listening to and have purchased it too. I can truly see this CD going Platnum! Go Clay!!"
5,And WHY didn't he win again?,"Clay Aiken's debut album, Measure of A Man, blew me away the first time I listened to it. Along with several beautiful ballads, there are also some upbeat tracks that allow Clay to show his versatility as an artist. Some of my favorite songs were Invisible, the catchy, upbeat first song on the album, and The Way, which showcases Clay's amazing voice. Overall, this is a great album which many people will enjoy!"
5,How can you not like it?,"I just don't understand anybody who didn't like this CD. I love every single song. These sweet power ballads are just awesome!! A voice like Clay's makes me smile. Why he was a runner-up, I have no idea.You have to get this CD, because each of the songs have great hooks, melodies and tempos. I can't just pick one favorite. I encourage everybody to get this CD and dance with your loved one. I read a review where someone said that Clay lost his ""soul"". I could not disagree with you more. It is his soul that makes these songs work and make them powerful.Whoever reads this review, I encourage you to buy this CD and give it a try."
5,Measure of a Man,"I love eveyone of the songs on this CD. The voice of Clay Aiken is refreshing and mezermizing. I'm amazed that in this day and age with the stuff that's out there that an album such as this is even possible. The music and words are beautiful and very reminiscent of music from the 80's. There is actually hope for music today, thanks to Clay Aiken."
2,Clay Aiken... where are you???,"Clay is a true talent... and I am sure he will grow / mature into a great singer. But this cd is full of pop fluff... there are no show stoppingnumbers to be found here... Clay is not a pop star... he should be in aWestend or Broadway show delivering show stopping number after number. And as one reviewer said... that even ""Solitaire"" wasn't included (which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent)... As for the American Idol creators... we're slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion... and even Clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is INVISIBLE!!!"
5,INCREDIBLE VOICE,"Even if the material is not the best, Clay more than makes up for it with his spectacular voice. Buy this cd, then listen to the kind of voice that only comes along once in a while.Happy listening! :)"
4,Sing in the shower,"This album is not too edgy nor is it complete schlock. It doesn't hit you over the head with sex and swearing, but it does not go over the top in the smaltz. There are some songs that manage to be edgy and sexy, mainly because they don't try to be. This is pretty much just a fun cd. You can sing these songs in the shower. Touch is a very smooth song. With it's hip hop/latin rhythms, this song should be a hit. Invisible is pretty catchy. When You Say You Love Me will get you going. It's a country pop song that could really go eitiher way. This is the Night is stuck on here. That is not one of the best. If you really want to hear something sexy, put on Run To Me. He sings in his gorgeous and deep lower register. There are plenty of key changes in this one. Listen to that and The Way and Perfect Day. You'll be impressed with the range. Perfect Day and No More Sad Songs have a rockin edge. The songs on this cd could be better. Hopefully, Aiken will further try out hip hop and country."
5,Refreshing,Received Clays CD and have almost worn it out! Just great - great voice - great music - great words!!! So nice to finally have a man who can sing!!! A young man the youth can look up to!I recomend this CD to all ages - you will love it!!
1,Was disappointed,All the songs sounded the same. Sappy twiny ballads. I heard he had a great voice yet heard nothing spectacular in this cd. I could just bought an all love song cd of various artists and gotten better satisfaction. I would not recommend this cd to anyone with musical taste and it will put you to sleep. Go back to the drawing board Clay and try again and maybe with some feeling and variety this time. I should have known it would blow considering how fast he put it out my dumb.
2,Disappointing,"This cd is very disappointing...His voice is not used to the fullest extent at all. He compromises his voice, it's computerized, and his values on this cd."
5,Billboard said it.,"This is on the Billboard site: Clay Aiken's ""Measure of a Man"" is the best pop album of 2003. Every song, every note is brimming with ambition and glory. Thanks to the bull's-eye A&R talents of RCA chief Clive Davis and a cast of grade-A songwriters-including Cathy Dennis, Desmond Child, Kara DioGuardi, Gary Burr, Steve Morales, Andreas Carlsson-the ""American Idol"" hero's debut album perfectly matches his radiantly melodramatic voice with good, old-fashioned power ballads aimed straight for the gods. Throughout, the timeless production focuses squarely on Aiken's immense talent. ""Run to Me"" is arguably the sweet spot, the quintessential tear-jerker, along with show-stoppers ""No More Sad Songs,"" ""I Survived You"" and the title track. In another radio era, this album could be the ""Thriller"" of the day, spawning hit after hit. In any case, fans have plenty to celebrate. ""Measure of a Man"" is an utter triumph of art and commerce.-CT"
4,Clay,"Clay strikes a bigger hype than any of the American Idols and debuts his first album which is just amazing! Clay is a talented, sweet young man with many ambitions for the future.His voice is so strong and will carry you track to track. My favorite song on this album is ""I survived you""My only complaint to this CD, is that many of the songs sound the same. However, clay did a good job vocally on the songs, and many people will enjoy this CD!"
5,Timeless Music From a Singer That Sings From The Heart,"It's been many years since I've been this moved by a singer and the songs he sings are straight from his heart and touch the soul with it's magic. The songs Clay sings, his heart and his voice cross the generation ""gap"" (my daughter and parents also enjoy Clay's style and voice) and truly can be enjoyed by all. This CD is one you can sing to, slow dance to and love to both now and in the future.... it truly is a timeless and classic treasure."
2,Not A Good Introduction,"I knew nothing about struts before picking up this book. I know just a little more after having read all that I can stand of it. The book provides very little example code and what it does provide is just in little snippets that don't really help. I'm halfway through the book and I can't take any more theory without being able to get some basic examples running. I consider this book more of a reference than a learning tool. I am abandoning it in favor of a different book. If you're new to struts, look elsewhere for a good introduction."
2,"Good Start but, ...","Good start. But, sort of slumps downward and never comes back.Might be ok as a reference."
4,why this cd compilation was necessary,"This compilation is a pretty good mix of their best songs. I would have bought the original cds instead, but they don't seem to sell ""Don't Tread"" anymore. They are rereleasing it in May. The nice thing about this compilation is that it made me look at the songs from ""Damn Yankees"" again and I was surprised to find that I like more songs from it than I had originally had. If you like good rock 'n' roll, buy this disk. If you like it, buy ""Don't Tread"" in May. It is definitely worth the money. There are some good rockers on it that aren't on ""Essentials."""
3,If You Own....,"If you already own ""Damn Yankees"", and ""Don't Tread"" CD's, there is no need to buy this ""Best Of"" release. If you don't own either of the CD's, this has all the songs you will need. It would have been nice, (in this compilation), if there was something new that didn't make it to either original CD's. That is why I'm only giving this CD, 3 stars. To bad Ted, Tommy, Jack & Michael didn't give us another release. If or when they ever do, crank up this or either of the only 2 original CD's, and enjoy true American musicians, doing what they do best...playing good solid kick ass rock & roll!"
2,Was this necessary?,"I guess they will put out a greatest hits album for about anybody now. This ""supergroup"" put out 2 albums and really had only one big hit in ""High Enough"". It is here and there are a few other good tracks, but nothing to write home about. This is the work that Tommy Shaw did after his first falling out with Dennis DeYoung and it has influenced him ever since. this band is a major reason why STYX is without DeYoung and the joke of the classic rock world today."
3,Do not be deceived!,Beowulf was NEVER a 'christian' story!!! It was written long before Europe was 'converted' at sword-point. I suppose that christians were also the firt to tell the tale of a great flood too??? (apologies to gilgamesh).It is a rather weak retelling- but if it gets children interested in reading about real heros- that's stilll a goood thing.
5,This Is An Awesome Book!,"I liked this book a lot. It converted ancient history into what people love to read these more modern days. I'm a 7th grade student in Indiana. I read all the time, but this is one of the best books i've ever read.it's really hard to believe this used to be ancient folklore. I recommend this book to all people who like a good book."
2,iLuv 702 FM transmitter on Nano,Dies after Nano battery is about 75% of full charge. Excellent sound quality when it works.
4,Deep Fried Texas Soul,"Vastly underrated and underrecorded Texas soul and funkster's 1960's recorded output for Huey P. Meaux's Crazy Cajun label. Medwick, was employed as staff songwriter for Don Robey's Duke/Peacock label during the 50's and 60's where he penned several hit records for Bobby ""Blue"" Bland including, ""Further On Up The Road"" & ""Cry Cry Cry"". Although, known less for his singing then his songwriting abilities, Medwick proves beyond a dobt that he's got the vocal chops. Medwick, convincingly tackles everything from the guttiest of gut wrenching ballad's to sanctified soul numbers, Texas funk and r&b. This disc is certainly worth it's weight in soul, My only complaint would be the sometimes oppresive church organ which challenges rather than compliments Mr. Medwick's efforts. A nice acquisition for lovers of no frills southern soul."
3,Looking for a little more,I'm hoping the second episode delivers the real goods on these 2 main characters! These are a couple of my 2 favorite actors.
4,Good entertainment.,Amazon service and playback works great. The show I like but I have a soft spot for period pieces. The story lines are predictable but in a good way.
4,Good Stuff,"I picked this out of the bargain bin at Amoeba Records, in San Francisco. For a buck, I thought, hey, why not? I can still afford a couple of Crimson and Sabbath discs. Turned out that this record became one of my favorite listens. I can't even start to describe the genre, I just go with what I like. The ingredients include: One heartbroken girl, singing hearttugging songs, a guitar with enough fuzz to sand wood, steel-corded bass(very little thump, presumably to let the notes go through,) lilting sustain-driven keys, and snappy drum sounds. To try to embellish any more aspects of their sound technically would be foolish. I will say this, however. Their interpretation of the ""The little drummer boy"" is one-of-a-kind. Ah rum pumpum pum... rum pumpum pum...."
5,A great collection from Richard,"Richard D. James, the mastermind behind Caustic Window now has a collection of tracks from various Caustic releases that are very hard to find. With this disc, you can get a lot of what youre missing! Bizzare, trippy, funny, and sci-fi worlds of electronika is what you fly into while listening to Caustic Window Compilation. Those with open minds about music, and have patience for the infinite world of electronika, then this album is a must add to your list. If you didn't know, Rich is also the Aphex Twin, Polygon Window, Gak... hes a genuis. He is my #2 all time artist, falling short only to Trent Reznor. Check out Aphex Twin's Ambient Works 85-92. Richard composed this album at the age of 15. Also check out Ambient Works II for a more soothing abd relaxing feel rather than the raw energy emitted by Caustic Window. A definite reccomendation!"
2,maybe better kept unpublished,"First of all, I have to say Alice Adams is (was, alas) one of my favorite writers. Of short stories. Not novels. I was thrilled to have won a short story competition to be in one of her workshops. To me, almost all of her stories are perfect. I can read them over and over. Her novels, however, are a different story. Rich Rewards has its rewards and there is something intriguing about Second Chances. But all the others left me disappointed. A disaster. Which is how I saw ""After the War"" from page one. Ridiculous characters. A mess. I would rather that my memories of Alice Adams did not include this awful work."
4,"Design Flaws, But Works Great","WARNING: This product contains only one (1) ankle weight.I purchased this product for use with physical therapy from knee surgery.Pros: Works as advertised, comfortable, the design/contour of the arches make for a comfortable fit with shoes on. The adjustable bars make for a good product. Unlike granulated/sand materials that seep into your sock/shoe/pants over time.Cons: There are several design flaws that come to mind. For one, the one strip of velcro is all there is to hold the 10lbs. One would think a belt loop would give added support. When not using all 10lbs, the excess velcro strap is in the way and does not stay down. The entire ankle weight slips up and when doing leg lifts (the entire ankle weight, not the bars themselves)."
2,"Some good features, some bad.","The ability to adjust the weight of this product is great. The BIG disappointment is the velcro strap, which I can't believe will last long, especially as I begin to add more weights. I think this product would have been far better if the ankle weight came with an adjustable strap with a plastic buckle closure. Then you would adjust once and just simply buckle the strap when you put it on. This feature is especially critical when you're trying to put the weight on your ""bad"" leg and struggling to get it snug with the long unwieldy velcro strap. I can not recommend this device with this strap mechanism."
3,Slips around ankle,"It is easy to adjust the weights to get the desired pounds. The problem for me is that I use them for leg lifts and the weights slip around my ankle; therefore, the weight is not equally distributed."
3,It has charm....but at what cost?,"It must have been about 5 years ago or so that I bought this album. I listened to it fairly regularly for about a month, and it fit well in my summer listening rotation. I enjoyed the inherent charm of this bedroom-recorded affair. Bikeride doesn't overdo anything: handclaps, whistling, horns. But perhaps that's the problem. If you haven't heard it, maybe a good way to describe it is on par with 3rd generation Elephant 6 bands. But wait - they predate those bands, so I guess you could say they were the first of the 3rd generation to pray at the altar of the Beach Boys. The album is most certainly a little bit twee, but I went through that important stage in my emotional devlopment (what a confessional review this has become). By the end of the summer the album found its way underneath my bed. Being stuffed in a trash can for the second time by my roommates was a good catalyst for change."
3,"Nice album, not the best of EC",Not the best album but a good one. Great invitations on it as Ron Wood & Bob Dylan.My points 3 out of 5.-
5,Great Read,This is one of the greatest SF/Fantasy books ever written I more than enjoyed this book it sits up there on my book shelf alongside Stranger in a Strange Land - magic.
2,Don't bother with this one.,"Now maybe I'm just dumb, but I found this book incredibly tedious to read. I could live with the vague religion, the convoluted story line, the cheesezy references to ""old earth"", even the dense and overly decriptive paragraphs that yield little in the way of plot or character devlopment. I slogged though all that and at the end of it we find out very little about ""sam"" or what he was doing this whole time except that he is fighting a civil war againist the gods. I could go on and on, but basically don't waste your money on Lord of Light."
4,Always entertaining,"...To avoid repetition, I won't repeat the details of the story.While it's not as easy a read as his Amber series - the story seems more dense somehow, maybe because it's all in one book - Zelazny's dialogue still sparkles and his humor is still as sharp. While it's not exactly hard-core SF, it's an entertaining read, full of surprises, epic moments, and memorable characters.I was recommended this book by a friend who said I remind him of Yama (the God of Death character in this book). I'm not sure what he meant, but I assume he meant it as a compliment somehow. That's what sticks with me about this book. Hope that helps."
5,An awesome book,"I've read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy over the years, and Zelazny remains one of my favourite authors. His style may not suit everyone: the pace can be quick and he often gives you brief allusions to things you never hear much more about. It's a part of the way he creates a world, by giving his characters a story and a history beyond that which is set down in the actual novel.Zelazny didn't always get it right - for example, I found ""Eye of Cat"" very hard to follow - but I think he's done it perfectly in ""Lord of Light"". It gives a powerful beauty and poignancy to both the beginning and the end of the novel, while the imagination and presentation of the magic/technology remains as consistent and fresh today as when he wrote the novel in the 1960s. This novel has a permanent place on my bookshelf."
5,One of the Best,"Without question one of the finest SF novels ever written, by one of the absolute masters. If you have never read this book, find it and buy it and read it and read it again. This is such a rich, rewarding novel that once is simply not enough to appreciate the brilliance that flashes from every facet.Heaven is a much more interesting place now, and the world is a bit more mundane, with his passing."
2,Didn't work for me,"Maybe I would have loved this when I was in college? My 13-year-old son turned me on to this book. He loved it but to be honest, the first half of the book seemed to be intentionally confusing and unexplained. I was too tired to take the rest of it seriously. I sped through it slowing down to wonder about the significance the character spouting the sermon on the mount near the end. I'm giving it two stars to show my lack of enthusiasm in the first reading. Since my son liked enough to get the hardback for his 'best books' collection, I feel bound to give it another chance some day."
2,Stay away from U3,"My flash drive stopped working after I plugged it on a Windows Vista machine. After that, I couldn't even format it. I had to install and uninstall U3 three times to (luckly!) revive it. This drive now is in probation mode until I can trust on it again to keep important data.Just google ""u3 cruzer format problem"" and you'll understand the problem."
5,fits my Bosch BSA2101UC canister,My Bosch BSA2101UC canister that I picked up at a pretty reasonable price does a great job but began expelling stinky exhaust. The exhaust comes out the top directed towards the user so I thought I'd try one of these. It did solve the problem but it sure is an expensive solution. The smell might be caused by our 2 dogs although we keep them regularly washed and I don't notice a smell until I vacuum.
3,Not very fun,My little girl (18mos) and my 3 year old son have shown no interest in this toy. I can not say that I blame them. It is just not a fun toy for children to interact with. It has been shoved to the back of their toys and not played with at all.
1,Farm or Blocks?,"This toy is quite small. I think when you see this toy, should think if you are going for the block or farm concept. Whichever one it is, either get another farm toy or blocks. (Mega Blocks) Also animals roam, they don't jump, so when child plays they wouldn't naturally want to stick the animal in the block numerous times to get where they are going. Just my thoughts."
3,"Rather tepid, considering its subject matter....","It's hard to believe that you can make a tepid documentary out of the Jonestown massacre, but that's exactly what we have here. The film is interesting solely because of its subject matter, not because of its presentation. The documentary ends up being very superficial, covering things in a very quick, piecemeal way, and there is precious little new information that I haven't read and/or seen before. The only thing that I didn't know was that Jones's church was one of the most integrated churches during its time (with a mostly black congregation), and this caused much consternation during Jones's time in Indiana. The interviews are interesting and sad (many of the subjects lost relatives in the massacre), but there's nothing particularly new here, and for such a fascinating, tragic subject, you'd figure the filmmaker could come up with more material. There's a better film to be made out there about Jim Jones, Jonestown, and the People's Temple."
4,"Good, but could have been great.","This documentary is well made, but I feel bad for anyone who saw only the film and didn't see the DVD. Without the deleted scenes, which explain how some of the members escaped and what happened to them afterwards, the film makes even less sense, and frankly, there are many questions left unanswered. For example, why Guyana? We never hear how or why Jones chose that country to establish Jonestown. At 90 minutes, the film should at least be re-cut to include the deleted scenes, and could have gone much further in its exploration of People's Temple. That said, it's well done and interesting to watch."
5,Very insightful devotional,"I haven't completed the book yet, but so far have found it to be very insightful and enjoyable. It begins in Genesis and continues from there hitting on the most commonly read Bible sections to the not so often or seldom read sections. He ends everyday with a thought provoking question to think on through out the rest of your day. I always look for to the next reading."
4,great easy book of all bible stories,"This book is about all the main stories from the bible with a commentary after each by yancey and quinn, it is a very easy introduction to the bible and easy to read for anyone, especially those who find the bible tough going. I brought this book for my husband on the recommendation of 40yr male,and he was right, my husband loves it has brought one for his friend and is still reading it months after I brought it. A great book to read completely through, to get a good knowledge of the bible"
3,Vanilla,"Although at times very engaging, it wasn't as captivating for me as the Arthur or the Hood series. But the author's grasp of Celtic ways, terms,and places is wonderful, and sometimes subtle."
2,The book can be half of its size!,"I'm sure the otherworld is absolutely beatiful but do we have to spent soooo many pages describing it?! The plot moves along soooo slow, I almost didn't finish reading it. Now that I did, I wish I didn't waste my time."
1,yuk!,one of the few books that i just couldn't make myself finish. so bored after reading a third book i just couldnt make myself read any more.'
1,The Paradise War,"I wanted to like this book but it seemed to shuffle on and not land anywhere. It started out so good and then was slow explain what it was like in paradise. I could imagine that if you were a fantasy fan you may be interested in these details but alas, I was not...skip it."
4,Good book but I've seen it's type before,Much of the material is familiar to me as I recall reading a book about King Kong back in the 90's that was a lot like this one. I do not recall the other book's title but I feel certain this book deliberately draws heavily from it. This book goes back and forth between the different Kong films a little too much (it would have been better to keep the descriptions of the films in more sequential order) but it is very imformative just the same.
3,not what i expected,The belt turned out to be not what I expected. While it worked great for the first two weeks one of the grommets fell out of the belt. Coincidentally it's the same spot where I'd buckle the belt when wearing it. Otherwise it was very comfortable to wear and work with. I do wish that CLC replaced one of the hammer loops with a clip for a tape measure as I use FatMax tapes that don't fit into the pouches very well. At this time I'm trying to get it exchanged for a different model belt.
3,Sanctuary the complete second season BluRay,"Unfortunbately cannot review as although the BluRay Packaging shows as valid for zones A, B and C It will not play in Zone B so money has been wasted My advice to people is if buying BluRay from Amazon be very careful as the labeling on the packageing may not be correct and you may purchase a product that that will not play in your zone even the laleling indicates that it is valid for all zones."
5,Should serve as the basis for a required course in every Seminary,Well written - fast read - thoughtful - excellent footnotes.Clearly and forcefully refutes much of the fuzzy thinking of the last fifty years.
5,No other name upon which humankind may be saved,"It used to be typical for the majority of Evangelical Christians to insist that the true Jesus (2 Cor. 11:4) was the only way to God, as all other ways fell short. John 14:6 used to have meaning to the church. However, in recent years, the meaning about the exclusivity of Jesus have blurred, as many have turned to pluralism or, at best, inclusivisim (Jesus can be found innately in other faiths).In this book, James Edwards deals with the issue head on. Indeed, he holds to the conservative position that a true relationship with Christ is vital to one's standing before God. In the last chapters, he hits Postmodernism head on and also talks about what to do with other monotheistic faiths such as Judaism. His conclusion? We should continue to preach the gospel to everyone who does not have a personal relationship with Christ. I, for one, am glad to see this scholar hold such a view, and think the book is worth a look."
3,Deceiving work,"Well, I consider that previous works where really better. In this CD we can find to remakes(Taa Dem and Rebel Warrior), and they are the better songs of the CD!I'm a little bit deceived. It seems like they are trying new beats and rythms but ,in my opinion, they still have a lot of work to do. I liked a lot Fictions and Facts, Rafi's and Conscious Party. All previous CD's where on the same line: mixing New Dance Trends with amazing asian sounds and REALLY POWERFUL lyrics.The lyrics are still strong and with a lot of meaning, but the music is not so exciting for me."
3,better than other marai's,"i really gave it an honest shot, but i am not a fan of marai in general. he was a master of making you feel like you are on the hungarian border: lots of tension over what is to come, but nothing comes in the end."
2,Not the best...,"I usually wear a size 7 and purchased a size 7. They fit OK. I do get a little bit of room in the back of the heels. I have definitely had more comfortable heels than these. I'm used to wearing heels, but these are some of the most uncomfortable I own."
4,Better than Previous,This cd contains 23 tracks of Southern Rap. Wich can be sometimes annoying but Silkk Comes through with this one.
5,Sylvia Brown's Book of Dreams,I enjoyed this book very much especially the chapter on Astral Visits. I have experienced this but didn't know what it was. This book is filled with lots of information and Sylvia never disappoints me.
3,Dream a little dream of me,"Sylvia gives her interpretation of dreams in general - from our screaming nightmares to running on a sun-kissed beach. If you want a simple explanation of what did last nights dream mean, this isn't the book for you. I like it, but most of my questions still aren't answered."
2,Book of Dreams,I was a bit disappointed in this book. The beginning started out well and then I lost interest in the subject matter.
4,A Classic Endures,"I love Rangonis, and this shoe is no exception. The style is classic, works well with slacks or skirts or jeans, and it feels great!"
5,"Good price, good product","This is the most comfortable tennis elbow support on the market. For the money, the set of two is a great deal!"
2,I could make something better myself,I have the Bandit product and got another one but wanted something that I can alternate and wear at work without looking like a lost squash player.This did not give me any relief and after adjusting it every which way it just did not cut the mustard. The only time it gave me relief was when it also kept blood flowing to my fingers.I would give it one star but I am going to use it as a fancy - and pricey - cuff guard instead so I don't get chain grease on my trousers.
4,Awesome,"This product is great!There was a thunderstorm in which i had other screen tents break, but this one stood strong Although it doesnt come with directions to put it together it pretty straight forward"
5,Good bedtime book for baby,"We have been reading this book at bedtime toour 7 month old baby. He loves to hold the book andlook at the glowing pictures. There is one sentenceper page, and they rhyme nicely, ""Sun sets, crickets chirp,day has turned to night. Stars twinkle up above, housesglowing bright."""
1,Thank Your for the warning,"I had 3 of these shirts in my cart and saw the reviews and just took these shirts out of my basket. Thanks all for the warning. Bill Blass, Hmmmmmmm, I thought they made quality merchandize. Live and learn."
4,"Thin, but worth the price","If you wear dress shirts to work everyday, you might choose to pick up a few ""cheapies"" for some days. These shirts fit well, the measurements seem to be accurate (mine were 16.5 34/35) and in line with many of my ""brand name"" shirts. They are however thin, a nice clean undershirt is a must. That being said, they are good value for money, especially if you tend to stain shirts often... cheap enough to throw away, nice enough to wear to the office."
2,"Below average shirts, nice stitch","Paid around 10 bucks for the shirt, but its not wort 10 bucks at all, cant wear to office cos the cloth is see thru. very thin cloth."
1,"Terrible shirt, low quality and bad fit.","All I can say is don't waste your money.This has to be one of the worst shirts I have ever purchased.It looks nice in the pictures, but in this case looks can be deciving. Flimsy material, and the collar appears to be simply paper inside."
1,DONT EVER BUY THIS SHIRT,The shirt is NOT at all of a good quality. It does not worth $6 at all. Its transparent also. Please save your money and buy a better quality shirt.
4,CRANK IT UP,"GOOD CONCERT, LOTS OF THE HITS. WISH I KNEW WHAT HE WAS SAYING IN GERMAN THOUGH. OVERALL GOOD CONCERT. GREAT TO SEE FORMER MEMBERS. GREAT DVD FOR THE MONEY."
4,The same great band on stage,"A great band always give you excellent music. A good review of their best hits, including their previous players. I just hate the camera moving. You can't see nothing. Every take last half second. When they are doing solos the camera is taking everything but the player. In spite of this, good video."
5,Uncle Tom,"This is a touching story of a boy whose mother abuses him during World War II. William is sent to live with a man named Tom, who lives in the country. As William slowely settles in he and Tom become the best of friends. Then one day he is sent back to his mother, who beats him and locks him in the cellar. Uncle Tom follows William and finds him and gets him to a hospital. They then get to live together. This is an exccelent book. I would reccomend it to EVERYONE!!!"
4,Super Reader,"A group of men come to misfortune at sea. They have the dubious misfortune to come to the attention of Captain Nemo and his highly advanced submarine, Nautilus. While this prevents them from drowning, they do get caught up with some of the odd Captain's other pursuits. Ned and company do certainly get some education in oceanography and marine biology along the way.They do have to worry about what the antiheroic supergenius Nemo is actually up to, though."
5,Falt like I was right there,This story was a fast pace adventure that kept stretching your imagination to great measures.I would defidently recomend this book to everyone with a taste for adventure.
2,Good first half -- extremely dissappointing end,"I really enjoyed the first half of this book. I had to read it for a school assignment, and I was liking it. Once it got past the first halh, the book's plot went downhill. Majorly!!! I think it had a very disappointing end."
1,I only gave it 1 because you can't give it 0.,"Don't get it. It was the worst $[amount] I ever spent on something. It has an impossible-to-follow story line and a boring, boring, plot. Classical? Harry Potter's more Classical than this. Save your $[amount], buy gum or something, I don't know."
2,"Volume changes, two tapes not understandable","I was hoping to introduce my teens to Jules Verne while traveling; so, I ordered the audio cassettes. However, on most of the tapes, the volume would suddenly go down to be almost inaudible. The quality of two of the cassettes was so bad that only about 1/4 of the tape could be understood."
1,Very Hard to understand.,"I gave this book this raiting because it was hard to understand. The words were very hard and I didn't know any of them. The book did have a good plot but they made it to hard to know what it meant. This book did teach us about sea life, which was the ONLY thing in my opinion. I would only reccomend this book for highschoolers."
2,Interesting but Repetative,"While reading this book I was extremely fascinated and into it in the beginning. But as the book goes on, the main character continues to classify underwater creatures over and over and over. The only thing that kept me reading until the end was the mystery of Captain Nemo (which i have to say, was never really revealed, and a bit disapointing ending). So all together, and VERY detailed and interesting book, but too slow and boring overall."
3,alright,i thoght thisbook was okay it was a tad bit boring thogh it had its exciting parts but i feel it could have had more action and suspece.
5,Verne Classic,Story perhaps more relevant today than we realize at first glance. Passions controlled yet unleashed in righteous indignation are prevalent both yesterday and today.
4,Bought from Amazon for my kindle,"A classic book I never read. Totally enjoyed reading or perhaps re-reading it. I saw the movie many times, and several different versions. A joy to finally read the real story as written. Even after all these years I could not put it down and intend to re- read it often!"
2,Too dull through most of the story,"I agree with most of the other reviews in the sense that there are four or five scenes in this book that get your heart-pumping. Unfortunately that accounts for about a quarter of the book. The rest is full of detailed descriptions of sea life that would appeal to the most passionate environmentalist. The story was interesting, but you have to plow through a lot of boring text. Have a pot of coffee ready!"
1,Beautiful packaging - but the translation is terribly flawed.,"For those who, like me, have found great pleasure in surrounding oneself with great literary works, the Easton Press edition books seem to have a lot of draw. However, it has been my experience that many of their novels by foreign authors can be found to contain older and flawed translations.This specific Easton Press contains the Mercier 1873 translation that edits out 25% of the original text. The major flaws in this translation led to a slew of critiques by the scientific and literary communities (that did not refer to the original French).Fortunately now there is a new version:Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea/Completely Restored and Annotated. This translation is true to the original text that shows Verne's actual correct calculations as well as including the 25% of the text lost to English readers for over a century. Happy reading.Peace, Ben"
3,Details were sometimes tedious,"I read this after reading ""Mysterious Island"" just to get the background story. I think that Verne must have been a botanist and/or marine biologist - he goes into SO much detail on fauna and aquatic wildlife. This distracted from the story for me, I often found myself skipping pages just to get back to the journey."
5,Dynamite songs here!!!!,"This year of 2005 is very young, a couple of months, but this is one of best I've heard of the new music of the new year! Brian McKnight really tops himself with Gemini. This album focuses on a live sound and it shows on many songs. Everything I Do (with its similar Bryan Adams song title in the chorus) is the best song here, as Brian shows that falsetto a lot on this song! A couple of the songs, he sounds eerily close to Marvin Gaye. Because Brian is so true to his music, writing and producing his own songs, this album is one of his best. I like his hip-hop driven songs with Talib Kweli, Juvenile and others, and he has his own heavy beats on those songs! Brian does his own Dr. Dre thing on these few songs! The final number is dramatic and very timely for the Lent season of some religions. Brian's song about Jesus on this final song is moving and emotional. This album just shows Brian McKnight at the top of his music game. I hope this album has a lot of hits soon!"
2,Weak,I waited many months for this album to drop and when I finally bought it whenit came out I was very dissapointed! I give it 2 stars to stand for the only 2 songs worth a second listen. What we do here is a decent song . Everytime you Go Away is an amazing song but doesn't keep this album from sinking.
2,Needs rebooting several times a day.,"Works well when the modem initially connects to the provider CO. Wireless seems to work well. NAT functionality seems good. However, within minutes to hours, the connection to the CO slows to a virtual stand still. Cycling the power makes the problem go away for a while, if you can put up with doing that every few hours. Firmware upgrades so far have contained empty and unrealized hopes of fixing this problem. You may feel like you've been taken advantage of by the manufacture if you buy this modem after reading on the box how wonderful the product is."
4,Good Combo!,"The Zoom X6 is a good combo if you are wanting a little less clutter on your desk. I did not have much luck with the install disk though, I went online and found the users manual to get it set up. Works very nicely indeed. Would have rated it a 5 if the install software worked. The speed of my connection is great for both my ADSL service and wireless network."
1,Look before you leap,"I should have glanced at this book's format before I wasted my hard-earned dollars on this junk. It's simply a huge heap of quotes, regurgitated in some order known only to the authors. The ""story"" (simply interviews ad infinitum) unfolds by seasons of the show, without any sort of context, without any stab at putting the times in any perspective, without a clue, often, how the lesser-known characters contributed.It quickly became a very frustrating read, and then became one that left me shaking my head in disbelief.It would have been a good story if the outside world had been permitted to enter into it. But it doesn't. I know the writers aren't lazy, look at all this verbiage!, but it doesn't add up to a hill of beans. Dang, the ratings system doesn't allow one to enter NO stars at all. Save your money. Terrible."
3,Zweibel's phraseology threw my back out,"My favorite bit of commentary is from the shlub named after a German onion.ALAN ZWEIBEL: ""It's like when I was doing Garry Shandling's first series, we wanted to have Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop on. I said, 'Of course we'll fly you out', and she said, 'Well, what about Lamb Chop?' What *about* Lamb Chop?!? She says that Lamb Chop gets a seat. I swear to God, I almost threw my back out giving her the benefit of the doubt that she wasn't insane. I laughed and she said, 'Lamb Chop doesn't sit in the back'. I said, 'If I'm not mistaken, are we talking about the same Lamb Chop? Because, you know, it's a sock! It's a sock with a button, okay?!?' And it ended up we didn't use her because it was too insane."""
2,It deviated a lot from the book,"Really, the title of my review is my review. The movie deviated a lot from the book and being a lover of Narnia, that was very disappointing to me. I hate what they did to Peter's character, I was annoyed by the added ""love interest"" and most importantly, Aslan was often left out. I love in the book the picture of faith and trust with Lucy having to decide whether to follow Aslan even when noone else believed her that he was there. That was not fully addressed in the movie - I suppose cut in leu of more battle scenes and false tension between Peter and Caspian. sigh. A very pretty movie though - I loved the river god - just sadly altered."
5,+Great Family movie!,This was a purchase for family movie night. I was very pleased my husband even enjoyed watching!
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Repeating the formula of the moderately-better ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" (poor CGI, lots of religious references, and uneven performances) but with a worse script and a terrible turn by Ben Barnes as a hunky European version of the film's title character, Prince Caspian not only fails as a self-contained film, but bodes very poorly for the franchise."
1,Wasted my money,The disc was a region 1 and i cudnt watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!! And i could not change my Samsung player to multi region.
3,Movie was great!,I screwed up with this one and didn't read everything. I didn't read the fact that it was a disc only which was not good. The movie played great!!! I just wish I would have read the fact that it didn't come in a case.
1,Thanks for the case,I was disappointed with this seller. I got an empty DVD case that was shrink wrapped. The most frustrating part about it was I never received a response back from the seller after trying to get in contact over and over again. There goes my hard earned cash!
1,terrible quality when it did play,Let me start with my internet connection was great. I checked my connection and my settings 7 times. And I had rented another movie from Amazon and it played flawlessly. And just to be absolutely sure I rented yet another movie(all 48 HR paid movies) and that one worked perfect. At least 10 times I for a error message saying you are having trouble playing this title please try again or choose another movie. Or you are unable to view this movie etc... When it did play it was terrible quality. Or a scene would freeze up but the audio still continued. Very dissapointed.
1,Disappointing sequel,"This sequel is greatly inferior to the first movie. Where the first one had an interesting story, nice atmospheric environment with the ice world, and a sense of awe, this sequel is almost nothing but fights and chases. Very dull."
3,"for what it was, it was pretty good","But the thing that had me checking out emotionally was the assault on the castle about midway through the movie. I just wasn't buying that the army of beasts and birds would have been repulsed:1. The main army was supposed to have been bivouacked somewhere, leaving the castle thinly defended.2. Element of surprise intact: the castle defenders were supposed to be sleeping, yet here here they all were suited up lickety-split in chain mail!3. The soldiers would have been freaked out seeing centaurs and talking mice.4. The gryphons should have been lending some formidable assist, yet after depositing their cargo, they pretty much disappeared.5. A key commander, Prince Caspian, knew the castle grounds intimately and would have been able to brief his troops superbly.Because I couldn't take the result of this battle seriously, I was unable to take the rest of the movie seriously and so kept watching the minutes count down until it ended."
3,Prince Caspian review,"We chose this for our grandson as he had enoyed 'The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe'. Unfortunately this was beyond his comprehension and did not therefore capture his imagination. It will keep until he is older, he is 5 years old."
2,Disappointing - stick with the 1st movie,"I purchased this for my 11 year old son for Christmas. He has the first movie and has watched it numerous times. After we watched this movie I asked how he liked it. His response was same as mine. We give this a D rating, at best, a C. I have a feeling he won't be watching this over and over again."
4,Story doesn't follow the book all that well.,"There was an allusion to a romance between two of the characters that was not in the book at all. Also not in the book was an entire sequence with a character from the first movie. Many things were completely out of chronological order from the original story. Those things said. It was an overall good movie adaptation of the story. Mostly you come away with the same message as the original. If you enjoyed the book you will probably enjoy the movie, provided you realize the story is similar, but enough changed that (beyond the obvious differences between books and films) it is a different experience."
4,Great sequel,"This 2nd installment in the Narnia movie franchise picks up one year after the end of the first movie; in England time. When our four heroes return to Narnia, it is actually a millenium later. But the ensuing movie is just as exciting as the first one, with even some romance thrown in at the end. Like any good fantasy movies, Prince Caspian has several grand battle scenes, creatures of various species interacting with each other in English, great swordfighting, and some double-crossing, both by good guys and by the bad guys. All in all, a great 2+ hours of movie-watching experience. Some of the movie does take part in the night, so turn of the lights while watching it."
1,Wretched,"C.S. Lewis has to be rolling over in his grave, as this pathetic adaptation abandons his story early on and turns into a smarmy, boring CGI exercise. Pointless battles, pointless special effects, flat characters, ridiculous dialog and no sense of wonder at all. The film invents half baked soap opera subplots that go nowhere. I can't imagine a worse film adaptation. Prince Caspian is the weakest of the Narnia books, but it is a jewel compared to this dreck."
2,caspian falls short,"It is unfortunate that there was not a ""C.S. Lewis"" fan club to keep an eye on these movie makers like the Lord of the Rings fans did. There are many beauties and strengths of the Narnia series so far, but in Caspian, the departure from the novel changes the story in an extremely unfortunate way. There is no real justification for the filmmakers' changing the story, it is change for the sake of change. They could have adhered more closely to the book without losing anything. Caspian was my favorite book of the series, and the movie is terribly disappointing. Peter and Caspian were allies, not antagonists. For the sake of ""high concept,"" the filmmakers have pretty much gutted the story. Good luck with all that. We are stuck with this version now, in the sequence. The actors continue to be good, but the story has been altered for no apparent reason. Sorry, I wish I could have liked this more. There was a lot of potential."
4,We Were Soldiers review.,I have not watched this movie for about 4 yrs but I remember it being very moving in how it portrayed the sacrifice a person makes in leaving home and family to physically fight an enemy who is determined to take away another culture's right and ability to live in a society with a democratic level of the right to choose for oneself one's future and present. I met a man recently who said he had been in the battle portrayed in this film and he felt the movie was pretty accurate in capturing the intensity and brutality and terror of it.
5,The Chronical of Narnia - Prince Caspian,I gave this DVD to one of my God-daughters as a Christmas gift. We watched it with the whole family and we all enjoyed seeing the movie. It is nice for young children to see and learn the battle between good and evil and watch good to prevail.
3,I liked it,I liked it but I don't have much to say about it. It was good and I would buy it. The Dawm Treader movie was the least liked movie of all the movies to date but I would still buy it.
3,"Don't know how it compares to book, visually great","I've bought all three Narnia movies, just this one from Amazon, and perhaps the best thing about this one and the others is how beautiful it looks, the story is also interesting. I don't know what sort of career young actress Georgie Henley will have in later years but I liked what I saw here.Pay attention to the special features disc, that'll be we'll worth your time."
5,OMG,"OMG!! This was TERRIFIC! I was so pleased that all the actors/actresses from ""TL, TW, ATW"" came back to Prince Caspian!!! It was awesome... the sword fights, the battles, the waking of the trees, Reepicheep, and the bits of humor mixed in here and there! I loved it!"
4,Got it back,I lost this CD a while back & was never able to find it so I'm glad I was able to download it. Now I have a permanent digital copy of a lot of my favorite reggae tunes.
5,A great resource,"This is a great knot resource; compact, durable, very accessible, and well designed. You can't go wrong."
4,From Longy,I'm never surprised by anything Connie Francis does. In this album she takes on the greats from Patsy Cline to Hank Williams and does not disappoint. Well worth the purchase for any Connie Francis and Country fan.
5,A new perspective,"A groundbreaking work with a new perspective on how to achieve successful outcomes in business. I use the Smart Spot techniques daily.Nancy Copeland, President, Copeland Strategies"
5,"""My Favorite Book""","We had seen a fantastic theatrical production of The Wind and the Willows at Imagination Stage in Bethesda. My 6 year old granddaughter was mesmerized. I had seen the book in the gift shop and was very impressed with the illustrations. I decided to give it to her for a Christmas gift. I did worry that this edition is abridged, but the other reviews convinced me that it really was not a problem. She declared it her favorite book and her Mom reports that she takes it into her ""tent"" to read and really seems to be enjoying it."
1,Deceptive presentation,"This product is abridged and not what I wanted. If Amazon wishes to sell an abridged version of a product the word ""ABRIDGED"" should be at the top of the page in big flashing letters, not buried somewhere."
2,Sharp looking but quite thin!,"My husband doesn't like to wear shirts under his dress shirts; however, he will have to with these. I ordered 2 whites and 1 tan. They are nice looking but very, very thin. The retail tags say $45. I'd be quite upset if I had paid that much! I guess for $9.99, they'll be okay. I didn't save a lot though cause now I have to buy some new t-shirts to wear underneath! If you don't have a white-collar job, these would be fine (at a reasonable price) for occassional wear. However, my husband has to wear them everyday, and I doubt they will hold up well since they are so thin."
1,Boots,"The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.Drop ya boots, dawg!!!It"
3,Not yet convinced,"I read this book as a part of a class. In this class we discussed Washington's work as written from the 'trickster' perspective. In this light it was quite interesting to see how he points out hypocrasies indirectly, while apparently stating the opposite. Thus, creating a self-aware hypocrasy within the text itself. I'm not sure that I am yet convinced, however. The work often seems a little bit on the acquiescent side to me."
5,A wonderful book,I found this book both enlightening and informative. I had no knowledge of this institution and had only heard of Mr. Booker T. Washington in my history class some 46 years ago. Easy reading.
5,An inspiration,"This book reminds us of the great truth, that hard work will always in the end be rewarded. Booker T. Washington exemplified the American spirit."
2,High Mountain but a flat book,What an amazing accomplishment! I wish she could had written the book better! I admire mountaineers but this book was frustrating to read. She sounds so arrogant in this and just not a nice person. I can understand being on a team with some annoying or inexperienced people but that is the chance you take being part of a team. If she didn't want to listen to someone talk all the time or deal with someone that didn't have her experience she should have hired a private guide to take her up the mountain. She always mentioned her compliments and her achievements and how she triumphed eventhough she was a girl-and how the guys on the team would make comments- OH PLEASE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. If you want a really good book read Into thin Air or Seven Summits.
1,A Great Story; A Bad Book,"After reading ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer and ""The Climb"" by Anatoli Boukreev with G. Weston DeWalt, both of which were excellent and engaging books, I turned to ""Facing the Extreme"" by Ruth Anne Kocuour. Like Krakauer and Boukreev, Kocuour found herself high on a dangerous mountain in a blizzard. Like them, she survived, while others met their death. Unlike Krakauer and Boukreev, she did not write a great book about her experiences. The biggest problems with this book are the constant flow of bad jokes and puns, the constant put-downs of several of her climbing companions, and her total lack of modesty. Krakauer opines in his book that who lived and who died was a matter of chance, and that he could have easily died. Kocuour repeatedly tells the reader that it was her skill and planning that made her a survivor. I found her and her book to be obnoxious and less than entertaining."
2,Not Good,"I picked up this book from my library because the cover looked interesting and the blurb looked interesting. The book consists more musings and less research and organization. The author begins to tell a story or talk about a myth or idea, and then jumps from topic to topic, and we never see the end of her train of thought.I stopped reading around Chapter 3, when the book turned to the ""taboo"" of being a redhead in the Elizabethan era without any mention of Queen Elizabeth being a redhead - not to mention that red hair during this time was actually quite fashionable."
1,Sleep-Inducing at best.,"This book poses somewhat of a conundrum. Is it an over-thought monologue on the author's own hair color, or an exceedingly dull scholarly treatise? The answer: it is both! It's a hodge-podge of historical references, anecdotes, and Patty Scialfa. Never delving deep enough into the history, it manages to still lay on what it does say with an all-too heavy brush, dripping with overindulgent prose.In the end, it is sound and fury signifying... the onset of sleep. If you are in need of a never-ending supply of sleep medication, save yourself some money and buy this book. If not, don't bother."
3,REDHEADS UNITE!,"This book was written by a woman, for women. I enjoyed the parts of the book that explained the science and history of red hair."
4,Take the Ride!,"Get ready to ride through history, science,lore, myth and fun stuff about redheads. It takes one to know one! I have recommended this book to other redheads, and will continue to do so. And yes, we are different!"
5,A GREAT BOOK!,"A VREY GOOD BOOK. I like the inventions that Alvin made and how the book was written. It was neat how Alvin solved the mystery with his great inventions. I reccommand this book to you if you enjoy reading mystery books. So go to the bookstore and but it, Right Now!"
2,Misaligned Parts,"Under the table surface, there are two factory-assembled bars used to connect the four legs. Clearly the bars on my table were misaligned, as they almost stick out of the table surface at one end (I will upload a photo for that), and left no room for the legs. This rendered the whole table useless.It surprised me how such a defected part could get through the manufacturer's quality control. You don't need any fancy tool to discover it. Looking at it would suffice.Finally I chose to fix it myself. It was not very difficult for me, just taking off the 6 screws that hold the bars, realigning the bars to the correct position, and then put the screws back in again. The extra 20 minutes work was still worth it, comparing to repackaging the whole set, the hassle to ask for a return, plus shopping for another table.The quality of the table (other than the misaligned bars) is OK. That's why I still give it two stars. But I would really hesitate to buy again from this manufacturer."
5,Tombstone Shuffle rises beyond the grave!,"Oh my GOD! This is absolutely the best album I have heard all year! ""Little Queen"" ROCKS! If you don't have this album, you should definately make it part of your collection! Definately your money's worth! And his fan club gives out AWESOME stickers..... KEWL!"
3,Good sun protection but a little greasy,"My title says it all. I like the sun protection but find that my combination skin and the oil content of Eucerin are not necessarily compatible, even in the hottest, low-humidity conditions of Southern California. Haven't given up. Will see how it works in what we call ""winter""."
4,A plain-English version of the life of Jesus.,"This retelling of the life of Jesus, is a simple, straightforward account. It would be very nice for a teenager or useful for a youth minister or a Sunday school teacher of teens and/or young adults.Bible Scholars and readers who enjoy more poetic language and more complexity would probably not enjoy this version; however, I don't think that's who it's intended for! :)I would recommend it for use by and instruction of younger readers and less experienced readers of the Bible."
4,Long Live Robin Hood!,"Just got the collection. Watched it in two consecutive nights. I loved this show from the first time I saw it. Brought back many memories sitting in front of the TV with my Dad watching it. I agree with a follower reviewer, the casing is not great. It's cheap at best. I will be removing the DVD's from the plastic casing and store them in an soft DVD case. ""Robin of Sherwood"" was ahead of it's time. I like the BBC America version of Robin Hood too, but this series had a grittiness to it that made it more believable. The ""pagan"" aspect of the show scared me a little when I first saw it (as a kid), but now I understand the fantasy aspect (I'm talking about the character Gunnar). The acting was incredible. The writing too. I wish the series had continued, but I am glad to own this set, finally."
3,Not much of a surprise ending,"After reading this book, all I can say is ""wow."" That was one long book. It was full of so much information on stocks and when to buy and sell. But the information was not the same old stuff that I have heard before, I was introduced to a whole new theory of buying when everyone else says that you shouldn't because you have sound information on your side. Loeb also talked about putting a good amount of your available money in a smart investment, and watch that investment carefully. A main point that he stressed over and over was not to invest just to invest, only invest when you are going to put in the effort to make money. I thought that it was a difficult book to read because it was about economics, but I think that it might come in handy once I do get money to invest. It was written a long time ago, but I think that the advice that Loeb gives in the book can still be used today."
3,Lacks one important connector: motor-control plug,"I've been pulling my hair trying to find a cassette recorder with two features:-Auto-reverse-Pause-control plug (for microphones with a record/pause switch).So far, all auto-reverse models I found lack this plug.The only currently produced tape recorder I was able to find with a ""pause control"" (aka Mic remote control) plug next to the mic-in is the Casio TP-7, but it lacks a motor/pause control plug.This is a note to manufacturers, why remove a useful feature for those of us who like control the recording from the mic, or use it to record phone calls (with a third party automatic recording control that starts the recording when the phone is in use)?."
4,Importance of nubmer 12,"Well, after reading the book the first time I was amazed how the number 12 is repeated during the history. The book is quite interesting ..."
1,Hex nut driver is not 2.2mm,I purchased this for some rimless glasses that have 2.2mm hexnuts. The driver in the tool is NOT for hex nuts - only star nuts. Do not buy if you have 2.2mm hexnuts - it won't work.
5,SNL Season 32,Excellent item! This is really an amazing item that anyone can buy for their own personal spare time and pleasure..
2,"Great film, lousy print","It's difficult to figure why anybody would bother using a poor 16mm print to transfer to DVD when there must be good 35mm prints out there, but this is another case of showcasing a very poor 16mm print. Otherwise, this is an excellent madcap film, but it doesn't start cooking until the Edgar Kennedy bartender scene, and Kennedy was absolutely masterful. From this scene on, the rest of the film is a romp. There was much luck with the sequences with Jacky the lion, so Sturges must have lived a charmed life. All the performances shine."
4,Really makes a difference,"We have a multiple pet household and are always working to keep it fresh. Over time, most vacuums start to get a 'dog smell' through the exhaust. I tried other products but this is the one that worked. Highly recommend for anyone with dogs or other issues involving vacuum odors. Note that changing the bag on a regular basis, and rinsing the foam filter pad, is also helpful!"
4,Filter away the doggy smell,I wish this filter came with the vacuum at purchase! With two big German Shepard dogs and endless hair about the house my Bosch vacuum was better at cleaning up after them than any other vacuum. The bags are so big that it takes them a while to fill up. This filter greatly reduces that old vacuum bag doggy smell I used to get. I'm very glad I purchased it. Delivery was very prompt too!
3,NFL Quarterback reflects on childhood,"This book is an attempt by Boomer Esiason to show that his childhood was not much different from any other child's. It is set up like a diary with reflections on many different events in Boomers youth. He relates stories such as giving a girl a valentines gift, fishing with his dad, building and wrecking a fort with his friends, playing baseball with friends and picking the weakest player first, etc.As I was reading this book I thought that a better title might have been ""Random Thoughts of My Childhood by Boomer Esiason"". There just didn't seem to be a point to many of the stories he was sharing, other than his desire to show that he was just a normal kid.Avid young football fans will probably appreciate the end of this book which includes several pages of photographs of Boomer and tells all about his football career."
4,Nice to have on the workbench,"While this isn't a ""must have"" tool for your building bench, it is worth having one around. A nice combination of a ruler, fin guide, and square edge which will keep your door and window jambs from getting marked up as you try to use them to draw the straight lines for your fins."
5,Makes it easier,"This is a relatively inexpensive tool that will make your model making easier and help you avoid the need to be using door frames to draw lines. If you're new to model rockets, or returning after 20 or 30 years as the grown-up, here's the easiest way I can describe why you need this: you're going to be measuring and drawing lines on tubes. They need to be accurate, from end to end. There are plenty of other purposes for this item, but that will probably be the first difficult step you'll face. It's definitely worth having."
3,Not so dumb.,"If you look on the cover it says,' Dumb Dora Edition. The problem with this is there was not one Dumb Dora question on this whole DVD though there is a good thing about it. It is for all of you Michael Landon fans out there as he appears in two Match Game episodes. Brett Somers talks about her time on Match Game in the bonus section. Guests are Michael Landon, Jack Klugman, Vicki Lawrance, Loratta Swit, Mclean Stevenson, Fannie Flag, Eva Gabor, Arte Johnson, Marcia Wallace, Avery Schreiber, Richard Dwson, Charles Nelson Reilly and Betty White.Best of Match Game DVD CollectionIf you care to give this one a shot this has more episodes and of course more laughs."
5,yummy,their not only good for you but their yummy.they smell like cloves when their cooking and taste a little sweet.
4,"Reminds us all to ask, what are we not being told?","Despite the fact that this book is well over 30 years old, it is still right on target. The examples given are a bit dated, but still do a good job in illustrating the principle.You do not need a background in any kind of statistics to understand and appreciate the lessons in this book."
5,Read it and understand,"An old book, but a must read for understanding the world today. Twisted statistics are nothing new, but we are bombarded by them all the time from every media outlet! This old book feels dated and the examples seem even more so, but the message is one we all need, look at the base data, understand the reason behind the author's presentation of the data and think for yourself! Start here and head for some of the newer examples and start to question the reasons behind the statistics."
3,Good but only for beginners,"A friend recommended this book. It is a quick and easy read, and entertaining enough. I'm giving it 3 stars because it really is only for people with very little knowledge of math and statistics. If you've ever taken even a single statistics or probability course, in high school or college, this book isn't for you. You already know everything it tells you. There are a few amusing examples here and there, but beyond that, it doesn't provide any particular insight."
2,Not Impressed,"I had hoped to really like this book, because the theme seemed so pertinent and promising. Instead, I was sadly disappointed. It was very much like watching Oprah. Lots of sunny stories about community turnaround, neatly packaged for consumption, with no individual relevance or useful guidelines for reproducing the effect elsewhere. This is not a book about getting to know your neighbors, or building bridges in your community. Whether this is a failing of the book, or just misleading marketing you can decide."
5,Good News!,"Have already got Waltz Favourites for the accordion so I knew what toexpect from this book. However, like the waltz music it's really good,easy to follow and I'm enjoying playing the many pieces and wouldrecommend it to anyone else. Many thanks"
5,First class! Works great. Folds for Compactness,"We got this for our daughter, she had a high-end Yamaha flue. It fits perfectly on this peg. The idea is not just to hold the flute, but after you are done playing, and you clean the flute, you still want it to really DRY OUT before you put it back in the case. This is the way to go. (Don't leave it flat, someone will sit on your expensive flute, or they'll put a book on it, or worse...)Very Happy. We'll look into adding a peg to this for a piccolo; that will be nice too!"
4,Best of the best in flute stands,"I bought this stand because I needed a stronger stand for my flute just to make sure that during orchestra, band, technical excerpt class, and other musician crowded spaces, my flute would be very safe and it would be harder for it to fall over. This is a great product! I have a gig bag for my flute, and it fits perfectly, but the stand is a little bit bigger and heavier than a regular stand. If you have a really small flute bag, you probably are going to have a hard time fitting it in, but the sure thing is that your flute will be very safe."
5,Janet is 'All For You',"There aren't words enough to express my love for Music's Multi-talented Ms. Janet Jackson. This CD is one of her Top and Best to date. The gritty ""You Ain't Right""(Stupied B***h!), the fun and dance ""All For You"", the pumping heart of ""C'mon Get Up"" to ""Trust A Try"", and favorites ""Doesn't Really Matter"", ""Son Of A Gun"", and ""Someone To Be My Lover"". The CD is jam packed with hits. And with the Bonus Track ""Who""..... the icing on the cake. BUY THIS CD! You won't be sorry."
3,Not really scary.,"This J-Horror flick starring the Japanese actress from Kill Bill vol. 1. Isn't really all that scary, but it's still kind of entertaining."
3,"Solid can, lousy spout","I really don't like the plastic ""spill-proof"" spout that comes with this can. There's a rubber gasket that wants to come out and actually *prevent* the valve from closing, which completely defeats its purpose.This is a very solid can, so I'm glad I bought it. But do yourself a favor and buy the traditional metal spout for it (Blitz 12040 3/4"" Metal Screw On Spout) -- you'll be glad you did."
5,classic (slapstick)comedy,"Its been said that the Three Stooges just werent the same without Curly, and this package has Curly,as well as Moe and Larry.Its a must for every fan and an exceptional bargain!"
1,Horrible!,"Only 4 of the Columbia shorts, one with Curly and three with Shemp. The rest is the cartoon version, Ted Healy shorts with one, two, or three or three of the stooges, and a terrible, amateur documentary. Even the box listing the cast is wrong on the Columbia shorts. It lists Curly Joe DeRita as the star of all of them. Run away from this product, or don't pay more than $2 for it."
1,junk,"junk, waste of money, very disappointed, even misleading as the packaging contains pictures of episodes that are not even in the collection"
1,Disapointed,"When I bought this set from wal-mart, I should have taken my own advice:""Let the buyer beware.""Given the number of shorts the 3 stooges made, the content of this set is lame. How they get away with calling this ""75th anniversary collection"" I'll never know. I enjoyed watching what is on this set-but there's not a whole lot to brag about. ""Kooks ture"" is about the best thing here-but still it's not worth it.Don't buy this set! Now you've been warned."
3,I Was Disappointed,"The video is okay,but it's a fooler. It shows Larry Moe and Curly on the jacket and both films have Shemp instead."
2,boring...,"i had actually purchased this movie at my local target store and i can say you cant judge a movie by its cover, it may look all nice and fancy but there is only a total of 4 stooges episodes on the first dvd, the second dvd are all cartoons and the 3rd is all special features and exclusive interviews with the stooges families, children/grandchildren. extremely disapointed."
4,Fiendishly clever,"Like many reviewers of this book, I also read it about 20 years ago, having already fallen in love with Thomas Tryon's writing in Harvest Home. From the first page of The Other, the haunting and insistent voice of the narrator grips you, and you are ineluctably drawn into his strange, isolated world. The story of the twins Niles and Holland, with its psychologically devastating twist in the tail, has haunted me ever since I first read it, and having lost my copy some time ago, I am desperate to find another so that I can read it over and over. A real classic of the genre."
4,I hate reductionists,"As philosophy of science this work is very fascinating. Unfortunately it is permeated with rather Marxist ideas which the author seems to cherish. But, as an incissive criticism of reductionist science, especially biology, it is very good."
4,Yeay Wormie!,"Green Wormie is my new best friend.Take him with you into the shower after a long, stressful day and let him vibrate all of your worries away.Now if someone asks you if you have worms, you can proudly say, ""YES!"""
4,Who knew worms could be so much fun?,"This is a delightful toy and very powerful. The downside is that it is very loud, looks like a child's toy, and it is a lint/hair magnet. However I would still recommend this product. It is a great product for misdirection or concealment if you at all concerned about getting flack for having a vibrator because the average Joe isn't gonna realize what it is unless you tell them. Great for travel since I personally think that it would be less embarrassing for some airport attendant to pull this out of your bag at checkout/check in then a different style vibrator."
2,"Just so, so....",Just didn't care for this story. Synopsis was interesting but the story didn't keep my interest. I will not recommend this book and hesitate to buy another book from this author.
5,Buy extra copies for your friends,"The book is short, engaging, and easy to read. It makes a strong case for keeping sexual sins out of your life and offers practical advice - as well as Biblical encouragement - for developing a lifestyle free of sexual misconduct. This book was well-received by my non-Christian friends, too, so don't hesitate to buy extra copies for them! Well worth the read."
5,A Necessary Resource for the subject of Sexual Purity,"What a great book! It is short and to the point about sexual sin. A quick read. It discusses it in a very honest but tasteful manner. It provides plenty of scripture. It convicts the reader regardless of how much sexual sin is in their life (mental or physical) and gives practicle and biblical strategies to either avoid it all together or to combat the sin that the reader might already be ensnared in. This book is good for men AND women, high school age and above! Great resource for pastors and youth pastors to have on hand. This book has given me a realistic perspective and has helped me to understand that where it all starts is with that first thought or that first glance...and that this is where we recognize it as sin and stop the process. Life changing!"
5,Works as advertised,"I just installed 2 garage door openers (Chamberlain) and I wanted a simple dual control module. This is not as fancy as the ones that came with the openers but it works just as well. I don't need any LCDs on my garage door openers. I just want a simple, easy to use opener that looks nice. This fit the bill."
3,"Eat Well, Feel Great, Gain Weight","I love the receipes in the book. The only thing I have a problem with is that the book states that ""No more weighing"", however it does not explain what an actual serving size is, it mentions briefly that you can weigh your food to get an idea of what a serving is, and then use your judgement from then on. Well, being someone that is over weight and has a problem with determining what an actual serving is poses a HUGE problem. That would mean, I WOULD have to weigh my food to figure out whether I am eating a serving or more. The title of the book is misleading, as well as the excerpts on the back and front cover."
1,The non-chef's cookbook (subtitle: Not just for dieter's),"I have had this cookbook for a couple of years without really using it. But a few months ago, I pulled it back of the shelf and never put it back on that shelf since. I never considered myself a good cook. In fact I am just the opposite, the typical single guy who used to eat out all of the time. This book has definately changed that. The recipes are very easy. And the dinners that I have made do not taste anything like diet meals. I recommend this cookbook for everyone - dieters as well as non-dieters. I am also not the type to write book reviews (this is the first and probably the only) except that I think so highly of this cookbook that I wanted to recommend it to others."
5,great disk,"I've liked Soul Coughing for a while now. I first heard them on the X-files soundtrack. Over time, I became more familiar with the band's music. When I heard that soul coughing released lust in phaze, I thought that was a great idea since I did not own any of their albums so I figured that Lust in Phaze would provide a good introduction to the band. After buying and listening to the album. Lust in Phaze covers soul coughing's career from Ruby Vroom to El oso. It also includes unreleased songs like Casiotone Nation peformed live. There is also the song from unmarked helicopters from Songs in the Key of X.Overall, the album provides a really great history of a band that should have been given more attention for its great music."
4,A movie that makes Sopranos look like a network soap opera,"Ok never heard of this guy knew of Omar Epps seen him do mostly Black Dramas so along comes this movie that had it not had him on the cover I probably would have ignored it so I picked it up read the back cover put it down came back a week later on one of movie nights at home and pop it into my DVD player and was loving it from the moment it started Takeshi kitano is pure genius he made me chuckle at his mannerisms but I loved his intimate relationship with Omar Epps character after running into him on the street. I'm glad there was a mix of races in this movie from Asain ,Blacks,Hispanic and,Italian.It gave the movie depth it made it seem more realistic. The only reason I gave it four stars was that the pacing threw me for a couple moments and I was tempted to fall asleep until the action started other wise it was a treat to see definently a buy when I can track it down on DVD."
5,A great movie - beyond just violence,"Beat Takeshi provides another violent movie, whose purpose seems to be that violence begets violence, and ultimately it's a dead end. The basic plot has Takeshi playing a yakuza forced to leave Japan upon the death of his boss. He finds his half brother in LA pushing drugs rather than attending school. Takeshi violently turns the small time crew into a major crime cartel.Yakuza themes of loyalty to family and honor over life pervade the movie. The omnipresent violence somehow avoids being gratuitous, perhaps because one realizes how more graphic it could have been. Unlike traditional western shoot 'em ups, we are left with the aftermath instead of the fight scenes themselves. At times it is hard to follow the plot and remember who is on whose sides, but perhaps that is the point."
1,TRUE CHRISTIANS recognize this book as a COMIC! book hahaha,"The Paid clergy are ""witnessing"" to their flocks to beware of the scarry Mormons!! If the truth be know, the paid clergy and evangelical hypocrites are more intersted in maintianing there meal tickets and car payments. haven forbid that there is a TRUE CHURCH of the Lord that doesn't pay its clergy, and young 19 year old men and women go on missions at their own expense. Gosh, those sound like christ like traits w, wonder why... ALL, PLEASE IGNORE your paid clergy and Evangelical Witnesser's, they are wrong and blinded by money. Seek out and LET THE MORMONS IN. YOU WILL JOIN THE countless MILLIONS who have found TRUE HAPPINESS and TRUE knowledge of CHrist and become a TRUE CHRISTIAN, a MORMON."
1,Glad I let them in!,I let the missionaries in and am forever thankful that I did. I wish I had grown up in the church--but I'm very happy that my kids are learning an important set of VALUES which they have the agency to choose to incorporate into their lives.
1,choco tacos,"I have to say I haven't actually read this book, but I feel like if you are considering giving this author a chance to influence your eternal salvation, you ought to give the nice people who come knocking at your door a chance too. Then pray about what you have learned and decide for yourself. But if you want to celebrate over Choco Tacos, you would have to go to Taco Johns, I used to work there and they are the ones who sell the tasty treat. (see other reviews for this book to understand what I am talking about!)"
2,Would you like to know more?,"Let me add a piece of advice to the ideas proposed in this book. When you hear the words, ""Would you like to know more?"" just say ""No thank you, and close the door. Closing the door is VERY important. When I lived in Salt Lake City, I had to learn to do that, because some people wouldn't take no for an answer. One furious Relief Society lady was so upset with my attitude of unbelief that she pointed to my dog and said, ""I suppose you think that dog is just as good as you are!"" I replied, ""Probably better."" and THEN I shut the door and watched through the window as her embarrased husband tried to lead her down the porch stairs. She must have spread the word in the neighborhood, because I wasn't bothered after that. Though this book poses some good questions, my advice is to not even get started or you are in for an evening of flip charts!"
1,Fascinating,"Actually, Taco Bell DOES sell ChocoTacos - I just had one myself! As a Mormon, I have to say that I found this book mildly amusing. The ""carefully hidden secrets"" about the founders of the church have never been hidden from me. There is nothing in Mormonism that is ""covered up"" - everyone is free, and encouraged, to learn as much as they possibly can! What the missionaries teach is the truth - the basic beliefs of the church. If you study them, the other controversial topics that come up have little relevancy to what we actually believe and what we practice. I have studied many religions and I've found that even among ""mainstream"" Christians there is a wide range of beliefs. It is the same for Mormons, and yet people are continually telling us what we do and don't believe! Really astounding when you think about it."
1,Easier way to handle the Mormons at the door.,"I have an even easier way to handle the Mormons at the door, and I'll give it to you for FREE. When they come to your door, say ""Thank you, but I'm not interested"" and then close the door. Save yourself 6 bucks and let people believe what they want. I do this every time some person comes peddling to my door. Be it a salesman or a religious representative of any religion."
2,Most Difficult English Assignment I ever had...,"I had the honor of reading this book in my 9th grade Advanced English class and while I am an avid reader and love all different types of literature this book still makes me cringe when I see it on summer reading list.While I've read review and I wish I read what they read because it seems like a very good book, but I could not make it through this book to save me. It was 10years ago I had to read this book and I often wonder if I picked it up today would it make any sense? But out of all the books I read throughout highschool and College this book is tedious and very difficult to read.Even with a tutor and note taking I still did not pass the exams that were related to this book."
2,Boring!,William Golding likes to kill you with detail in this book and he comes pretty close! There is one part about a fox and you wish that you would just die. The characters are confusing and the book is just bad!
3,"Different, a book to be read by all!","When asked to read this book my first reaction was, it looks so old, it can't be good. As i started to read it i found it different from all other books that i had read. The book is slow at the start but it does become more interesting as the author discribes the way the world is seen by Neanderthal man; 'pictures' are memories and they believe logs are alive and have a mind of their own. William Golding's view point on their world is really an eye opener and this is a book that should be read by all. Inspiring!"
4,SHOTGUN,"THIS CD IS MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH RUSSELL GUNN'S TRUMPET.ITS A NICE SURPRISE . I DO HEAR A NEW TEATMENT HERE FOR ""OLD CHESNUTS"" HE HAS HIS OWN VOICE IN THE INSTRUMENT AND A GREAT FUTURE AHEAD."
5,You can't go wrong with the Simpsons,"I purchased this set specifically for the Edgar Allen Poe's, ""The Raven,"" spoof, but the entire set is a great addition to any Simpsons' Fan video library. I recommend highly!"
1,Fuzzy Logic,Something NOT being disproven[sic] doesn't make it true. Example: You can't prove there isn't a tooth fairy.
3,i regret loosing the hour glass shape,"I got the garment and oh my,I had a perfect figure using the garment.The rubber detatched on the lower right side of the abdomen in less that 3 months and each time i put it on,i looked like i was pregnant on one side of my abdomen.People are wondering what happened to my hour glass shape and honestly i am considering getting a replacement but my fear is the issue of durability.I enjoyed the hour glass shape the garment gave me while it lasted.Chibuzor N."
1,Nothing Like Described,"Received the product and it is NOTHING like described. Instead of the item as shown, the item is only a short stomach wrap and not a more full body item as pictured. Returned."
2,Ouch!,I thought I was going to break by hands trying to get this on. There are like a MILLION little bra like hooks all the way down this thing and it takes FOREVER to get them hooked and it hurts my hands like crazy! BUT my fiancé did say that once I had it on he could see the difference it was making but by the time I got it on I was too fed up with it I just wanted it off! Go get some spanx!!!
1,MNOnlineBuyer2012,"Worst thing ever... I don't know how anyone could even wear this thing... It is so uncomfortable, and it hurts to sit down... and it makes you look lumpy. It's in my drawer collecting dust. I've owned it for almost a year, and gave it many chances, and I still can't get comfortable with it. I'm better off getting the cheap one at the local mall or some plain ole spanks!! Kudos to anyone who can wear this thing all evening under a beautiful cocktail dress or gown... not me!!! I wouldn't recommend it to family or friends... it is overly priced."
2,Very difficult to put on,The product was very difficult to put on that I just gave up on it. Couldn't return it because the orginal wrapping had been thrown away.
3,"I'm with Omaha - Mormon PR all the way, but enjoyable.","This book - like the Tabernacle Choir, a visit from Mormon Missionaries, and the video *Ensign to the Nations* - is both appealing and enticing. It gratifies you, while showing you how WONDERFUL the LDS church is.I enjoyed paging through this book(Did you know that Salt Lake City has a clothier which specializes in attiring LDS missionaries?), but I have to say - it makes my heart heavy."
2,Wan't as described,There was an inscription on inside of cover that wasn't described. Other than that price was fair. xxx xxx xxx
4,"i actually cried, i never cry when i read a book","i hated this book when i picked it up. my 8th grade class is making me read a war book and what better then a nazi/jewish story? wrong!! it was an amazing story....not one to want to read again, but one you get the first time. i guess my parents aren't really that bad, compared to hers"
4,"Good, but the ending could have been better","This book was very good, but the ending could have been better before adding on a sequel to it. I recommend this book. This book can get you upset though. Patty, the main character, is constantly beat by her father."
3,not exciting but good considering it was for school,This book is a one sitting book an ok book overall.Although naturally being a novel it has its turnoffs for instance throughout the book patty(main character) is in a search for heart and love and truth and right towards the climax when the book starts to jerk a few nerves and get your blood pumping faster it comes to a sour unresolutionary ending it basicly left me in the same state of mind as the whole book:important info not there in an unsuspenseful way. Also vital in a good book you have to like even spartially the main character which i didnt in this book. Patty was selfish and to hard to please and not mentally mature. I give it a B and for summer homework (which is why i read it)a B+
4,A Story with a Tooth-and-Nail Heart,"This is a beautiful story, told from the perspective of twelve-year old Patty, who is ready to see more than her parents can show her of love, and yes, at her age, of romance. Patty is loveably brave with her tooth-and-nail grit, but Greene never loses sight of the vulnerability of being twelve-years old. There is one awkwardly written scene, in which Anton is a bit too self-congratulatory for really having risked nothing, but overall, this book shows a different kind of Nazi soldier than the stock characters, and it shows heart."
2,way too sappy!,"this book was okay, but it wasn't the best book i have ever read. its basically a cheesed-up romance novel about a 12-year-old. its a bit unbelievable and unrealistic, but it got exciting at the end of the book."
3,Summer Of Josie's German Book Report,"This is a story of Patty Bergen, a trouble making, homely thirteen-year-old growing up on the American World War Two homefront. Patty's parents are verbally abusive, and her father is known to beat her on occasion. When a German POW escapes from the local prison camp, she allows him sanctuary in hidden rooms in her home. This German soldier proves to be her first love and one of the only people who truly loves her back.I, personally, would not recommend this book for pleasure reading. The novel had well-developed characters, and that was mostly what the author concentrated on. It seemed Bette Greene wanted to just develop a character, and not a story. When something tragic happens to Patty, I'm so busy learning everything about her that I did not shed a tear. Summer of My German Soldier seems to be an analysis of the adolescent human mind, not a novel I could fall in love with."
3,MIND TEASER!!,": "" Summer of My German Soldier"" is about a girl named Patty, who is 13yrs old, and how she tries to hide a secret from everyone, except a black woman, who is her maid and nanny, Ruth. Ruth is her only friend until she meets Anton, a Nazi soldier. Anton (his nickname) is a prisoner of America after the WWII. The narrator tells where the Nazis stayed when the war was over. Plus Bette wrote how people treated the Nazis when they came over- but also Bette writes how some of the Nazis were nice! I thought that this is an awesome book!!!"
3,What it is like to be an outcast,"""The Summer of my German Soldier"" gives an inside look to what it is like to be outcasted by society, family, friends, and peers. It is an ideal book to teach to high school students. Patty, the main character in the book, is abused by her parents physically as well as emotionaly. All she wants is love, and she finds it with a German prisoner, Anton, who was brought to US soil to be held.Germans were not liked by US citzens. It didn't matter if the Germans were soldiers or citizens themselves. The hatred was the same for both. Patty, outcasted by her family, took a liking to Anton. She looked at him for who he was; not what he was. This is an idea that should be instilled in all people.And this is the reason why this is a good book to teach to high school students. It can show them new ways to look at different people."
3,Leo Young - The Magickal Childe,"Odd Italian techno, courtesy of Leo Young. Even though the sampldelic ""A True American Hero"" is all about the bongo and electric guitar funk, we soon find ourselves in the bouncy noir of ""Cagliostro Is Back."" The drums that announce ""4 The Emperor"" seem a far cry from the anti-erotic moaning on ""DJ Pimp And The Scarlet Woman."" Young, above all, seems to be having fun, and there's nothing wrong with that: The retro disco of ""Mega Therion""; the returning bongos on ""The Caliph And The Alien""; or the pagan groove of ""Magus Tannino."" Enjoyable, if not particularly deep."
4,Cute story :),"I had no idea we had this book, I found it in my basement :)Tomas is usually watched by his sister after school until is mother gets home, but one day his mother is late and late, so his sister leaves him alone so she can get to her job. He's a big boy, right?This book realistically covers the normal feelings of being scared on your first time alone in the house, and also Tomas' pride in his resourcefulness in having an impromptu party for his teacher when she shows up at his door (to invite his mother to a school meeting, apparently).A previous reviewer said the characters are African-American. This is possible, however, with the names Tomas and Ana I suspect they may be Hispanic instead. No matter, it's not a crucial plot point."
4,This is a great machine,"I was a bit hesitant to spend so much on a rice cooker. From my 20+ years of making white rice almost daily, a rice cooker is a rice cooker. After using this machine everyday for 2 months, I find it to be no different from the many others I had used of similar style (ie a non-removable outer lid and a removable inner lid), except that it has something I desperately in need of --- a timer. The quality of the cooked rice is the same, though it takes almost twice as long to cook and reheat as other cookers. As another reviewer mentioned, I too don't particularly care for the condensation dripping, but I did not find the gross build-up. I find this cooker to be more bulky than my previous 10-cup cooker. However, because of the timer, I am very happy with this machine."
1,ABRIDGED!!!,"I bought this so I wouldn't have to spend a fortune on the book for school. Well this Kindle edition is so abridged, I found I didn't read half of the play. Don't waste your dollar. Find another version of this play."
2,A little bit wimpy.,"They write good music. They play their instruments well. The can write crafty hooks. So blame it on the singer and the lyricist (my guess, same person). The vocals are as weak as it's content, which ranges from anywhere to wimpy subjects as being afraid to ride rollercoasters to things so dull and ordinary it makes you roll your eyes when you hear them. The closest comparisons to this band is Orange Peels. Never heard of them either? Then imagine what Air Supply would sound like if they made an alternative album. The Lucksmiths could be a great a band if they didn't sing about such stupid things. ..."
5,A good game and a great Anime,"If you have played the games then you know the basic story of this anime.Compared to the Video Games of the same titles the story seems trimmed down and quit a few things changed.However as a anime this story is done rather well, the animation seems choppy in some places but it is done rather well as well.The story moves quickly due to it only being 12 30 min. episodes but you will enjoy it over and over again.This is a great Sci-fi anime with alot of action.If you like sci-fi action then this one is for you...."
3,"Okay, but not great",This review is from my nephew: Not enough episodes or back story on the characters; but it had a good plot and pretty good artwork.
5,It's a Guy Thing,"Face it - Guys like tooth picks better than floss - if we will use floss at all. If you are not into flossing try these picks. They work very well at getting between teeth and removing food that floss will miss. The tooth pick tip is tapered and ridged to get between teeth and clean out the tartar as well as food particles. The 'feathered' end is great at removing the smaller particles (similar to floss). These will improve your dental health when used regularly, and they are way easier to use than floss."
3,A little harsh for my older gums.,"I had been using GUM brand, but cannot find them just now. They were very soft and flexible for older gums.If you have a young, healthy mouth - these would be fine, I'm sure. They work fine, just a little harsh for older mouths."
1,I'd rather stick razors into my mouth,"Maybe it was my bad to buy a knockoff product that was so cheap. Compared to Gum brand picks, Doctor's BrushPicks are unusable. The picks have no flexibility or give. Maybe I could use them to clean out tiny metal machine parts."
5,Doctor's Brushpicks,Exactly as advertised and works much better than the Walmart brand which was tried after the original container of Doctor's Bruhpicks was depleted.
4,Liked them...didn't love them,"These brushpicks worked and did what they said they would do and most of them were excellent, but more than a few had rough places on the pick and the brush which was the reason I gave them 4 stars. It would help if they were uniform in quality."
5,Easy to use and it fits,"I could not find a bike rack from either Yakima or Thule that would attach to my two cars. So, it was with a great deal of trepidation that I ordered the Saris sight unseen. The mounting instructions were easy to understand and the rack attachs firmly to either of my two cars. Being the lazy sort, I store it in the mounting position for one of them. When I need to use it, I simply position the straps and snug them up. The straps are well made and protect the attachment points.Movement of the front wheel is minimal, but a bungee cord securing it might be advisable for long or bumpy trips.The practical and minimalist design of this rack is outstanding. I will tell anyone who seeks my advice on a bike rack to check out Saris before looking at any of the competition."
2,"Nice rack, but",Make sure your bike will fit the rack. They have a chart to make sure rack fits car but not that your bike will fit rack. I have two Treck Pures. They won't work on this rack.
2,overpriced and bulky,"I purchased this rack because it looked modern and cool. When it arrived, I was disappointed to discover how big it is. Even when folded, it takes up a lot more space than other racks. Since I have a small car, space is important to me and I don't want a rack that won't fit in my trunk or my closet.Also, the straps required a lot of effort to adjust and I could never get it really tight.There are better racks that are much cheaper, so I would recommed looking elsewhere. I exchanged this rack for an Allen Ultra Compact."
2,President,"The book was in good condition, however, they should have stated that it had been owned by a library. I would have known then that it was stamped in several places and not have purchased it."
1,Shockumentary: Extreme Collection,"I was very dissatisfied with this purchase because after I received the product, I found out that it was in a different language and I couldn't understand anything on the cd's."
3,Pci Express System Architecture,(...)I spent a couple of days trying to use this book and found engineering inforamation and details lacking as much as they are lacking in the spec. I am looking at other references for engineering help.
5,Perfect reference for PCIe newbie,I have 2 PCEe books and this one is the best one. I don't have any experience on PCI and PCI-X. This books really have a lot of basic stuff which is very good for PCIe beginners.
4,Two from Agar,"Journey to the 7th Planet:A United Nation exploration team lands on Uranus and discovers that a ""brain"" rules the planet. This brain uses the memories from the team's mind to create images for them to experience while on Uranus (e.g. one finds a replica of his village, one that is scared of rats finds a giant one, and or course they all meet their girlfriends.)Invisible Invaders:The Invisible Invaders have been on the moon (of all places) for 20,000 years and have decided to take over the Earth unless it's surrenders immediately. Well the Earth does not surrender and the Invaders arrive and start taking over human corpses. These corpses march all over the countryside reeking havoc, and taking over bodies as people are killed. The day is saved when John Agar uses a high frequency sound device to drive the invaders out of the corpses."
1,A book written by a torture lawyer,There's no way I would read a book and give profit to a man who wrote memos to attempt to allow Bush to circumvent the Geneva Convention against torture.
5,Important to understand Constitution after 9/11,"This is an important book in order to understand the Constitution and the response to 9/11. The attacks on this book here are ridiculous. Even liberal critics of the Bush administration and Yoo think this is an important book. Cass Sunstein, a famous liberal law professor, wrote a review in the New Republic that said: ""The most important theorist of the 9/11 Constitution is John Yoo."" He says ""Yoo has offered an inventive and provocative set of arguments about fundamental questions, and he presents his arguments with unmistakable determination and all the skill of a good lawyer."""
1,Yoo has no clue!,The 2 biggest mistakes made by government in my lifetime are Congress giving away war powers in 1965 and 2002. The constitution holds that declaring war is the responsibility of the Congress. If the Executive has grounds for war let him/her present them and Ccongress vote. Twice I have seen Congress abdicate this important power with disasterous results. This is just one of many examples why Yoo has no clue.
4,Great except for...,"Yes, the version of Back of My Hand is not the original which is very disappointing. There is a different version on the vinyl album, and still another version on the Starry Eyes compilation UK Pop. There is also one 45 RPM B-side that did not make the cut for this CD and that is Dumb Blonde which is also an excellent 80's Power Pop song! Other than those issues the CD is GREAT, can better appreciate that 80's sound with the digital clarity and no Rice Krispies sounds from vinyl!"
1,I didn't know they wrote so many songs,"I bought this album just for one song, their cover of ""There Goes My Baby"". The rest of the songs are okay."
3,opening Night,Not the same standard as some of her other novels but worth the read. Seemed like the reason thrown in as an unrelated fact to everything else.
2,1 good chapter,"The info in this book is terrible for a novice grower and an expert can use only the section on BREEDING thats it the only detailed chapter in the whole book.Another book lost in the past 70s and 80s knowledge of growing,and odd enough all the plant pics are of poor unhealthy,badly pruned,and terrible bud pics .....If you went by this book you will end up with the ABSOLUTE CRAP YOU WILL SEE IN IT!!!!!!!This guy makes me want to write a book on the subject very much,this book should be sent to 1970..............GEORGE CERVANTES REVISED INDOOR HORTICULURE IS YOUR BEST BUY TODAY and this book only for BREEDING..."
3,Not for the experienced!,"This video is a little slow for intermediate to advanced exercisers. You don't really sweat that much, and it's kind of along the lines of ""Sweatin' to the Oldies."" If you like this sort of thing, then this is the workout for you. If you enjoy more fast pace aerobics that will get you sweating, try her ""30 days to thinner arms and abs."""
4,Definitely a Motown party!,"I must admit that I couldn't stop smiling during this video. The choreography is somewhat challenging. But I enjoy learning routines. You watch exercise videos so many times, I prefer them to be a little difficult to master.If you don't like 60's Motown, don't bother. Otherwise, It's a lot of fun, and a great workout. You're so busy with the ""dance"" steps, the time goes by quickly."
5,TO RAISE A JEWISH CHILD,"A MUST read for everyone who is dealing whith the infinite steps that should be climbe, during the raising of a jewish child, as she (he) should be raised."
2,I like Elton but...,I admit I did not read the back of this CD carefully. I happily bought it and popped it into the CD player anticipating the wonderful tunes I had heard throughout the movie. But my favorites weren't there. The most important missing item? It's Tough To Be A God as sung by the stars of the movie. Elton John's duet with Randy Newman just isn't as much fun. It's not a bad album really. I was just disappointed.
3,Where in God's name are they?,"Ok Elton has a wonderful voice I was thinking of hearing some song clips from the ""so called soundtrack"" I liked the CD up until It's Tough To Be A God I was shocked when instead of Kevin and Kenneth singing it was ELTON AND RANDY! I like all the songs expect It's Tough To Be A God you could of at least putted the people who really sang it on that song (He sounds a little selfish putting his own voice on there )Elton you are a talented singer and piano player ,but you could of just for once putted someone else on the sountrack beside's you and Randy.Here's my tip when you listen to the songs on the sountrack skip over track 8 because Kevin and Kennetth don't sing it just all Elton ."
1,Never received,It is now June 5th and the cd has not arrived. Not happy. How do I get my money back? I had planned to perform a musical freestyle on my horse for a huge charity fair with this music but had to change my plans and use another selection as it takes weeks to compose the choreography and practice the timing with the horse..
1,"the ""greatest?"" now wait a second..","Now, I don't want to downplay the importance of WW2 and all the heroes, known and unknown, that contributed to the efforts of that struggle.. But to dub them the absolute ""greatest"" is an insult to both older and younger generations. What about the Revolutionary War or the Civil War, or WWI for that matter? What about the founders of our country who fought so desperately on the American frontier long before any of us were born.. Being 19, i belong to a younger generation, one that doesn't (at present) have any large scale wars to fight, though I'd like to think we can still amount to something and not have to live forever in the shadows of our valiant elders."
4,A good book that goes on too long.,"While the begining stories of the Medal of Honor winners were fascinating - and the stories of the famous were interesting - some of the others didn't grab me. It would have been better if it were somewhat shorter.I do agree with his premise - These people are from the ""Greatest Generation"""
5,a fine tribute to the men and women of an aging generaion,"Brokaw certainly captured the spirit of the 30's and 40's and he went right to the horse's mouth to do it.He offers biographial sketches of the big and the small, the rich and the poor who shared a common life defining experience in WW11. A wonderful gift book for the sons and daughters and grandchildren of this wonderful generation who took it all in stride and returned to devote a lifetime to continuing to build a strong America."
2,Tripe to make baby boomers feel good about themselves,"The book itself isn't bad - as bad as I would have expected from a media talking head.The problem is that the whole premise of the book seems to be a way for baby boomers to redeem themselves by attaching themselves to the people who fought World War II. This from a generation that never gave a thought for its own children, that trashed their parents until - surprise, surprise, they realized they're growing old, too. So now, all that is old is wonderful, when 30 years ago, all that is young was wonderful.So, while the baby boomers make themselves feel good, yet again, it'll be up to the generations after them to clean up their messes.More books like this will start pouring out as baby boomers realize their own mortality and start searching for ways to make themselves look better."
3,"Great Concept, Poor Execution...","Intriguing notion of getting a feel for the events that shaped ""the greatest generation"", but the utter lack of depth in these vignettes really does a disservice, not only to the reader, but to the subjects of the vignettes themselves. These people obviously are so interesting, have had such intense experiences--why does Brokaw allow them each two or three pages? Disappointing to be sure."
2,What about everyone else?,"Yeah, I'm impressed with everything that those veterans did in the years following the war, but Brokaw seems to focus only (or mostly) on those that became politicians or in government. What about the effects of the war on musicians? or artists? I would have liked to see him expand on his stories more. All in all, I felt obligated to finish the book (my mother raved about it, but then, she is one of ""those generation"") but I wouldn't recommend it or read it again."
3,"An entertaining, quick read, but the thesis doesn't hold up.","It's true what some critics have said. This book is not the most skillfully or subtly written. It also whitewashes the issues by making the entire generation look like war heroes who later became business and government dynamos. This is not a balanced sociological study however, it's Brokaw's celebration of a generation and a set of values that he admires. Those values are almost exclusively the values of the warrior (warrior in battle and warrior in business). Once that limitation is understood however, the reader can settle back for a fun read. For younger readers who know little of this period in American history, this is a good starting place (but hopefully not an ending place). I congratulate Tom Brokaw for writing it. I only want to tell him that there are other ways to be great, and other generations have explored and will continue to explore those ways."
5,A real treasure,"My husband loves watching documentaries, but cannot sit down and read a book. Until this one! He read everyday, until he finished it, and has started reading it again, 2 months later. His dad was an Army veteran, but he would never talk about it."
2,A Story Already Told,"I had heard good things about this book, but was disappointed. This story had already been told in this format, and been told better, by Studs Terkel in his book The Good War. Terkel interviewed more persons, let them tell their own story, and interviewed persons who had been successful as well as those that had not. Brokaw focuses only on those that had gone on to become successful, while Terkel includes those from all walks of life. If you are interested in reading a history in this format, I would recommend The Good War over The Greatest Generation."
1,"I agree with the title, but..........","I simply cannot understand why everyone is gushing praise on such a poorly written piece of patriotic blather. Is it that you can readily identify with the author when you plop down on the couch to watch the Nightly News? The rambling, disconnected content of this book left me wanting a refund. I am a proud American, and one who has studied this period of time quite extensively, and this definitely WAS the Greatest Generation indeed! This book, I fear, is going to lead to a host of copycat writings by those who will use their celebrity exposure to command a princely sum for a cliche-ridden hack job of a novel. Enough already!"
1,Greatest? Who says so?,"Ugh, probably every generation thought it was the greatest. While this book is highly popular because it caters to the current generation, it is hardly objective or researched in comparing it to other generations. What is the measure of greatenss? If it is number of lives given for one's country, then surely the Civil War generation gave much more and at a greatest cost to family. If it is technology, then surely it is the current generation. Brokaw never mentions that this same generation produced the nazis and the repressive values that decimated American families once the war was over. I think the book needs to be toned down and put in its proper perspective."
3,Somewhat tiring.,A great generation but an average book. Brokaw's celebrity status provided the publicity but you it's just plain boring after the first couple of chapters. The writing is flat and unimaginative.
5,wonderful reading,Why do they abridge audio tapes of wonderful books? It's a crime and punishment to endure.
2,Teleprompter journalism,"The storys of triumph and achievement are incredible and we owe a debt of honor to those who lived them and lived in the day. However the writing reminds me of a series of news segments on the nightly news. I found the book hard to read and bought the audio version and that too was unfinishable. I get a certain arrogance from Brokaw that I personally find hard to stomach. Just my opinion, I could be my revulsion of the product they put on the airwaves nightly and call the news."
4,Easy Read,"Entertaining book overall but was a little ""hokie"" in some parts. The author chose an interesting format by compiling a collection of individual stories about World War II. All the stories share a common theme of sacrifice, courage and duty. A very fast and easy read. Students of World War II will especially enjoy this work. RECOMMENDED."
2,Repetitive,"I couldn't even finish this book which says a lot because I hate not finishing what I've started. It's way to repetitive and one dimensional. The only part I really enjoyed of the book were the love stories. The rest were just the same thing over and over...guy joins the army, comes home and becomes a lawyer, politician, something of that sort. I have the utmost respect for that generation, but this book was lacking feeling..."
2,utterly underwhelming,"This book has received a lot of attention and is selling well---but that's a testament to the power of the marketing machine that's been fired up behind it, not to the book itself. Search back articles from the Wall Street Journal if you want to read about how the marketing was done. You'll learn very little from reading the book itself, though."
2,Disappointed!,"Americans reviewed EXTREMELY worthy--Just that there was no depth--more like a sound byte. And most of the stories came from American soldiers from the Midwest who were fighting in Europe. Hey,there were southerners, and there also was a PACIFIC War. Tom whom I adore and admire can do better than this!!"
1,Is this man running for office?,"Rarely have I been so put-off by a book. I take nothing away from the experience and hardhships of the generation of Americans who suffered the depression and WWII. That surely is a 5-Star story and my parents lived it. But this book is not that story. Instead I find cliche's and stereotypes. For sure, the last 50 years of American history has been one of accomplishment and success. But it is easy to forget that this was largely because the rest of the industrial world was in rubble after the War, and America had a special opportunity to excel and grow. - - I feel alarm bells when any group of people are described as special or superior. This type of thinking has resulted in too much suffering in our world. I suspect the reality is that Brokaw is laying the groundwork for a political career. Is 'The Greatest Generation' the modern 'Profiles in Courage?.'"
2,A fair picture of the depression/WWII generation,"Tom Brokaw's book is an evaluation of those he interviewed, much like the news he reports each night - detailed and personal. For those Marines who want a look at the same information, but just about the enlisted man of the Corps during that period, a comparable book is ""Gyrene"" written by Wilbur Jones, and published by White Mane Press."
2,Good idea - poor execution - shallow and simplistic.,"I listened to Imus for two weeks, and had to have this book. The I-Man should stick to politics and sports; book reviews are not his strength. I really liked the concept, and couldn't wait to read the book, particularly after having seen recent video interviews of WW II veterans, and Saving Private Ryan. About 25% into it, I had to take a break. There is nothing exciting or revealing here - just the very basic facts, folks - and that doesn't make for five stars. It really is too bad, because the premise was good, that is, telling the stories of the greatest generation. But it's all surface; there's no depth, and, therefore, no interest in the people whose stories are being told. Sorry Tom."
3,A pedestrain look at heroes who deserve much more,"Tom Brokaw has complosed short biographies of men and women who served in various ways in WWII, ways for which they should be honored. Their contributions in the war were given short shrift and no story is given the depth deserved. The book does serve a purpose, however, by reminding us that we are still living among heroes."
3,Great tribute to a deserving generation,"As my father noted, (he's a WW II veteran of the Third Division who was in Africa, Italy and France), no mention was made in the book of the Third Division, which had more casualties, saw more combat and won more Congressional Medals of Honor than the Big Red. This is a glaring omission, which Mr. Brokaw should correct in the next edition. Please forward this critique to Mr. Brokaw. Many thanks."
2,More Sound Than Substance,"I picked up this book intending to like it. ""Saving Private Ryen"" had predisposed me to a certain nostalga for the WWII generation, as had Dole's 1996 candidacy. Disappointment followed. The title, on reflection, is hyperbolic: was this really the greatest generation in all history, or even American history? Greater than the Civil War or Founding Fathers' generations? The stories are well-written, and interesting. The whole is not as great as the sum of the parts, however. I came away with the impression that this was another 'last good war' book, and thus it covering old ground. -Lloyd A. Conway"
1,"I only read half the book, more than I wanted to.","I found the experiences of these people somewhat interesting but not enough to feel that it is a best seller. I was born in Britain and was there until my early twenties, and after reading the short stories of those people I felt as though my story could have been included but never ever thought that it was that interesting for it to be published. I lived through the ""Blitz"" and had acquaintances killed and bombed out of their homes. When I spoke of these experiences with my five children as they grew up, I could tell by their reactions that it was not one to dwell on. The book I found to be not that interesting. There are probably Tens of Thousands of stories like these, maybe more interesting than in the Greatest Generation."
3,Misses a major irony...,"With numbing regularity, Brokaw and his news colleagues trash 1990s young people, apparently unaware that the youth of the 1930s, the ""greatest generation,"" were relentlessly trashed by the media, scholars, and politicians of their day as a cesspool of bad values, promiscuity, criminality, terminal apathy, drugs, welfare, and laziness. Maybe Brokaw should pause to reflect before regurgitating the latest ""kids today"" bashing his profession (and my academic one) specialize in."
2,Sound bite literature,"This book has about as much depth as a 30 second news story on the six o'clock news with even less fact. Obviously written to sell, not to illuminate the people it pretends to reveal. Come on, is this all that can be said about ""The Greatest Generation""? Any PBS program dealing with WWII is infinitely superior and informative."
2,Should have left the politics out.,"The day I bought this book I couldn't wait to start reading it. But I soon realized it was just another Politically correct book from one of TV's talking heads. Almost every life story in the book was about how they made it through the war and into the Democratic party to make the world a better place, with a few token stories about some other people who happened to be republicans and thus thier stories were glossed over. My question is, What does politics have to do with these storise? A disappointing book over all."
3,Worth the read,"I hesitate to give this book only three stars, because it might not signify how much I appreciated reading it. I'm two generations removed from Brokaw's ""Greatest Generation"" and while I consider myself somewhat educated had never really appreciated the sacrifices made during WWII. So why didn't I give it a higher rating? Probably because I save those 4 and 5 star ratings for books one can truly call great -- ones which are that rare combination of style and content that result in a great work of art.There's little that is artistic about Brokaw's book, nor should there be. It is reported in a journalistic style, of course. But that being said, it is a book well worth reading and one that I recommend."
2,"Shut up, Brokaw.","Evidently, the good news anchorman has been watching a little too much Saving Private Ryan lately. Naturally, the book gloats with little restraint over this generation's stance against fascism, neglecting its evident shortcomings as a nation half-governed by Jim Crow laws, or the social preception of the proper role of women as being confined to the household. Simply utilizing the fact that this generation took such actions that would easily have been undertaken by any sane people under these circumstances as an excuse to decry other generations as less worthy is grossly unfair. Yet, given Tom's journalistic background, his embellishments is hardly surprising. If anything, this book is testimony that history can only be properly evaluated by historians, not the news media."
4,"Not The Greatest, But, A Very Good Generation.","Brokaw wouldn't sell many books with that title so he had to fog it in a bit. Yes, my parents generation gave willingly and sacrificed much. They had a definition of what the words duty, honor and commitment meant more than my generation does and, I fear, more than my children's generation.However, the lads who risked it all back in 1776 were our greatest generation. No other one even comes close. These were wealthy men who could have settled with The Crown and remained rich. But, they didn't. They risked it all for the sake of an idea. Then, made that idea work better and stronger than any society in the history of the world. Adams, Jefferson, Washington, etc. They were our Greatest Generation."
1,A waste of time,"Mostly pontification. Where's the scholarship? The only reason I sat through this one was that it was an audio book and I was on an eight hour drive. If this is the greatest generation, I'm in the generation that got the bill. This book glossed over most everything. If anything it proved the opposite of its title."
3,lousy writing,"juvenile, composition is terrible,reads like a high school term paperwhile stories of soldiers and their families can be interestingbrokaw turned this into a chore.it is jumpy, and a lazy selection of other peoples words"
2,Publications crossed up,"I decided to buy The Greatest Generation 'Kindle Edition' and when I downloaded my purchase, I got instead 'The Greatest Generation SPEAKS'. The follow-up to it. Apparently this is some crossed up links at Amazon Kindle and if you look at this particular ad you will notice that in spite of the title saying 'The Greatest Generation', the actual graphic is from the aforementioned follow-up book. And I am warning you that if you click to buy, you may NOT get the book your actually wanting."
3,Terrible shipping,"This product arrived with the box broken open which had been put back together with packing tape. The perforated display box was punched open and I received only 11 of the 12 packages that where originally in the box. The shipper should have put the display box inside a regular brown shipping box in order to avoid this problem. I'm giving 3 stars because the sunflower kennels were fresh and very good, however, because of this problem I am reluctant to order this product again fearing that I might receive fewer than 11 packages next time. I've decided to place my next order with another company through Amazon."
4,TGMiller,"The Vtech I6775 5.8GHz 3-Handset System with Digital Answering Device and Caller ID is very easy to set up and use without the help of its user's manual.The display is easy to read and the ringer volume options are better than all of my previous cordless phones which were either too loud or too quiet, without much mid-range volume.This phone is a bargain in its price range."
2,one of the batterys was bad,of the 4 phones 1 had a bad battery. It hasn't been worth the trouble of returning since there are still 3 good phones. might be what you get with amazon
3,eh its aight,when i got it i wasnt impressed with the packaging.......another thing i didnt like was that it was kinda small.....like it said it would fit people 6'4 and up.....well im 6'1 and a half........and it was pretty small.....but other then that i do like it.....it is a nice vest....its good for airsofting
1,"This is a FIRST EDITION REPRINT, not the latest 9th edition","If you want a copy of the original 1940s edition, that is what this is. The Amazon webpage makes it look like you are buying a paperback copy of the most recent hardcover, but that's not the case.I purchased this item and will be returning it, not because the the 2007 edited version is so great, but because this edition doesn't even have the benefit of the original authors correcting their own work based on feedback and review!!"
1,this is not the latest version of the book!,"I bought the book because I think it is of the latest edition (edition 9?). But obviously, it is not, although it is printed in 2008.Amazon should specify the edition of the book!"
3,"Good, Bad or Indifferent - still a must have","In my opinion, this is one of a handful of books that any good student or practitioner of technical analysis has in their library. It's not an easy read but making money in the market isn't easy either."
1,NOT an OFFICIAL 2 Skinnee J's Digital Download! Support THE BAND!,"Hello Champions, this IS NOT an OFFICIAL 2 Skinnee J's Digital Download! Support THE BAND by downloading it from the band's official website webstore (2SJ.com) where it's available for LESS MONEY and in Hi-Res format!-=AA/2SJ"
5,Great Review for the DBA,"After reading this book and playing with the included practice test you will be in great shape to pass the 70-228 exam. That's assuming you already have a working knowledge of either SQL Server 7.0 or 2000. If you are not a DBA this review will not do the trick.One other note, while the practice test does not include many questions they will prepare you well for the exam. I found them as helpful as any of the more costly test prep products."
1,They just keep milking the old stuff,With 100s of unreleased tapes in the archives all Universal can do is re-hash old stuff again and againThe CDs are classic Allmans but why a box set ???
5,Great book,"I recently purchased this book and have found it to be immensily useful. My infant son died three months ago and I have been scouring literature to help me 'face' my grief. I love this book and, at times, I am shocked how elequently Kathy writes how I am feeling. I like the Biblical devotions that accompany each chapter. I use this book as a sort of Bible study to give me Biblical foundations to build my healing upon. I know that someday I will be a sort of 'mentor' to another parent who has lost their child and this is a book that I will give to them. I would say that this is a must-have. Also, if you are reviewing this particular book, I assume you also have experienced the loss of a child or know someone who has....my heart goes out to you."
5,"Be aware: The insert is in Japanese, and there are only 12 tracks. But it's worth it anyway.","The insert in this CD is almost entirely in Japanese, which was somewhat of a disappointment to me. And Amazon lists 17 tracks for this CD, but the CD that I got (directly from Amazon, not through a dealer) had only 12 tracks. Tracks 13-17 shown on Amazon were not on the CD.Despite these two problems, this CD is still very much worth having. This is truly beautiful music."
5,A correction to Amazon's list of performers,"In Amazon's description of the CD, they list the backup musicians as though they were primary, and make no mention of most of the actual choir members. Connor Burrowes sings the solos, backed up by his younger brother Edward, Simon Acott, Tim Burtt, Gerald Beatty, Matthew Davies, and Edward Pattenden. Critics have acclaimed Connor Burrowes as possibly the best treble soloist in recording history. As of 2007, he is still at university studying music, and has developed an excellent tenor voice."
3,"It's OK, but too environmentally wacko!","The work is is good and long. But, the commentary about environmentalism distracts from the work out. I'm not one of those kool-aid drinking environmental wackos."
2,a lot of useless information (within the total of 754 pages),"This is the kind of book which asks to be read for hours and hours AND then you go on double check on the internet. E.g. the list of hotels in Santa Cruz refers to the type of traveler who loves to spend more than $250 per night - tripadvisor.com offers a different picture...While planning a tour I'm looking for a tour guide which gives me distances on the map, smaller maps with an overview about an area or town (not only for SF or Yosemite) and more background information than the frequent use of adjectives (""breathtaking"" ""the world's most spectacular"").There is a lot in this book BUT..."
5,An excellent coffee table book,I purchased this book while in the Smoky Mountains. Even paying full retail it was a bargain with all of the great photographs and short but well written narrative to accompany the photos. An excellent photo book!
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"BY THE REVIEWS YOU WOULD THINK IT WILL BE GLORIOUS,BUT I HONESTLY LIKE ONLY 3 SONGS....BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME."
2,"Good, but already heard.","I expected this album to have NEW remixes but I felt like I was listening to the Love:Destiny CD (a special remix CD DC, put out for target.)We've all heard, Say my name mix, Jumpin jumpin', bug a boo and some others,the only ones i lke are Nasty Girl, ID2,and Dot, which are new remixesI liked Michelle's song. She a an ok voice, I was happy not to hear Beyonce wailing on the track. I still think this could have had ALL new remixes and I would have given more stars."
3,Excellent but needs more....,"THIS IS THE REMIX is a great remix cd overall.. i just think that they were being a little bit lazy... if they had the strength to release a remix album then bring new material not old turned new...dont get me wrong.. this is one of my favourites by DC3...my favourite song on here is ""dot"" the original was not that appealing at all until i heard the remix... this song is a constant in my cd changer in the car...other car bangers ""emotions"" (neptunes), ""bug-a-boo"" (refugee remix) ""no, no, no"" (extended) w/ wyclef and ""jumpin jumpin"" (so so def).I am not feelin the 'survivor' (extended) because 1. not extended at all, 2. da brat is not rapping as good in it, and 3. michelle's part is cut out of it (her part in 'survivor' is the best in the whole song). also, the 'so good' is not all that great. 'independent woman pt. 2' is the worst song DC has ever put out.overall this cd is alright but most of the remixes are great, and most of all of them suck...3.5= very average"
4,It's Destiny's Child so it must be good!,"Ok, so it's only a remix album- the band are currently at a 'crossroads' in their career so this package has been quickly released.On the whole, the remixes are of a superb quality (the best ones being the incredible ""Bootylicious Rockwilder Mix"" and ""Say My Name Timbaland Mix"").The problem is: Independent Women Mix and No No No Pt 2 have already been included on DC's previous albums.Also, the ""Survivor"" and ""Jumpin Jumpin"" mixes are good, but there are better ones.A remix of ""Get On The Bus"" would of been nice,too."
5,Exellent and great value. (5 star but could not enter above),The large muff is a great product for someone with circulation problems. Holds the heat for hours.
5,Excellent for kids,My son loves it. And he keeps watching it. Lots of lessons to learn from this movie. Even adults can benefit from watching a child movie.
1,Ummmmmm........scared,"I think that this is innappropriate for kids, because they should not grow up thinking that vegetables can talk. This should be taken into consideration before purchasing this video. My daughter now talks to any vegetable that comes home with the groceries."
3,Obscure Mod Revival Group,"I came across this group totally by accident in the early eighties, finding a cut-out bin vinyl copy for probably under a buck;they looked cool and I took a chance, and it proved to be more than a worthwhile purchase. Because of this group's obscurity I was surprised to see it released on CD, although the Japanese put out plenty of stuff like this. This record is pleasant, listenable, but nothing earth shattering. It should appeal to fans of The Jam, though the group is not quite in their league as songwriters. ""Time For Action"" and ""New Dance"" are the most memorable tracks. Some nice brass arrangements on this record also."
2,Not much of a game,"While entertaining, there's not much ""game"" to this... game. It's all luck, no strategy or ability to impact how the game moves or progresses. While that may be age-appropriate for 2 year olds, this game is definitely well below the suggested developmental age range of 4. I wouldn't even rate the educational value of this game very high, as by the age of 4, kids can already count, discern directions, and read symbols. The game isn't worthless, just not on par with Gamewright's usual flair, and definitely developmentally geared toward younger children. As this game has small pieces, though, it wouldn't be feasible to play this game with children in that age range. I don't recommend this game for 4+. Rather, check out Kids of Carcasonne, or Monza."
3,Not too good,"There are a few good songs here. Long Legged Linda notably, as well as I love Rock 'n' rollOh well"
1,Simply Unbelievable: It died 14 months after purchase,I would of given it 0 stars because it died 14 months after I purchase it(right out of warranty). I would have thought that for such an expensive product that would be more durable or have a longer warranty such as Cuisinarts 3 year warranty. I know that the main reason that people buyer this rice cooker is to make rice in it. But for $150 it really should have a slow cook and steaming function. You can buy a fuzzy logic rice cooker from Panasonic with both of these features for less and Panasonic rice cookers last a long time.
5,Fantastic Appliance,"** Be forewarned the 5 cups refer to 5 Japanese cups, each of which is equal to 3/4 cups. This does not hold 5.5 American cups**I did not even eat rice regularly before I bought my rice cooker. I do now!Reasons I love it:1. The rice comes out perfect every time2. Even brown rice is fantastic3. It cooks oatmeal on the porridge cycle and it is really good4. It is quick and easy to use.5. You can cook rice earlier in the day.6. I make extra rice with it and keep rice salad on hand for lunches.7. So, it has simplified dinner time and lunch time.I could go on and on. Do not hesitate to buy this.One small drawback-- the instruction manual is next to worthless. It makes sense to buy a cookbook like The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook by Beth Hensperger to go with it."
5,Love it!,I have owned several rice cookers in the past but this one is by far the best. It makes perfect rice every time.
2,Worked good for a month then became like any other rice cooker,"First off, we are an asian family and we cook rice everyday through the cooker or through a pot.This rice cooker was great for a month. The rice came out perfect and very soft and moist during that time. Now the cooker cooks the rice dry and hard like any other cheap rice cooker. Though we cleaned the lids and maintained it well, it's like one of those cheap cookers now; you just have to guess whether to add more or less water to get good rice.For the price, I expected more especially when you can get basically 5 or 6 decent cookers at Costco. In the end this machine will be like any other machine."
4,For 3 cups making,"After reading all the reviews, I have settled on this model because:1) Made in Japan2) NOT made in ChinaWe have always made 2 cups of rice but always thought it didn't turn out the best but it was a lot better than the Tiger that I have had for 12 years. With 2 cups, the rice came out kinda soggy and too mushy even on the harder option. Then one day I had to make a little more rice and used 3 cups and the rice came out perfect!!! It wasn't mushy. The individual grains wad defined and soft and delish.The porridge setting made the congee silky like, almost a silken tofu consistency."
2,"Good Rice, Poor Construction & Warranty","I agree with all the positive reviews regarding the quality of the rice, but I have to give this rice cooker 2 stars on the basis of its poor quality of construction. We've had this cooker for 5 months. The removable inner lid was recently dropped from a height of < 4feet. This short drop resulted in one of the tabs breaking off the inner lid. Since it was so new, I figured it would be under warranty, but Zojirushi said this wasn't covered and I had to pay for a new part ($15 with slow shipping, 10 days). I expected either better construction or better warranty coverage from a $155 rice cooker. (Now, effectively a $170 rice cooker for me) :("
5,Working perfectly,"We have had no problems with this rice cooker so far (a month along), and are using it regularly (every 1-3 days). The rice tastes wonderful, and is consistent texture and stickniness every time. I appreciate the measuring cup and setting for no-wash rice, which is what we typically purchase. It also does a good job of keeping the rice warm, and it is very easy to remove and wash the inner lid along with the rice cooking pot, which is a big improvement on our previous rice cooker. We have cooked takikomi gohan in this rice cooker and it also came out great. The only minor quibble I have with this rice cooker so far is that the buttons are quite hard to press without also moving the whole rice cooker, and the button labels were slightly confusing so I had to read the (quite well written) instructions before using it."
3,Battery Replacement,"For starter I have no complaints about the quality of the rice this machine makes but I am sure there are many other machines that make very good rice in the same price category. I am giving it a mediocre review because of the process and expense you have to go through to change the battery (even though it is only every 4 years or so). You cannot do it. The machine must be taken (or sent at additonal expense) to an authorized dealer who will have to desolder the battery from the circuit board for replacement. The charge for this work is around $20 or more plus $7+ for the battery. This process annoys me because I am sure other rice machines have a simple and inexpensive way to replace the battery (and it must be changed at some point, it won't work without it). Just something to be aware of."
4,Good for busy mom,"I just started to use it about for a couple of weeks and find it very convenient, especially for me a very busy, full time working mom with kid. Setting up time and go, when back, you have the warm rice ready. I haven't use this kind of product before, so I can't compare this one with others. What I am worried about is the damage of the inner bowl and the built-in battery. Where to find the services is a question for the future. One thing I want to mention here is the user instruction, it is not easy to follow. Two weeks ago I remembered I set time and left for work, when I am back with take-out dishes, the rice was not cooked, we almost missed the concert."
3,Too slow,"this rice cooker is really slow and unlike other reviews, this cooker does not make the rice taste better than the cheaper rice cooker we had. Our house is a blend of chinese and american and have a lot of experience with cooking rice."
3,"Great Quality, Rice Tastes Great.","This product is excellent. If you want great tasting rice, use the regular setting (around 45-60 minutes to cook). If you're in a hurry, use the ""Quick"" setting for a 15-20 minute cook time. Apparently the ""Quick"" setting doesn't soak the rice but it seems to taste just as good. Overall, the device is compact, high quality, and has a convenient retractable cord. Although a little pricy, I feel that the quality and features are worth it."
5,"Once into it, a wonderful and uplifting read.","Betsy Howie's Snow took me a few pages to get into -- she starts without providing the context upon which we readers tend to depend. I also feared that the book would be an angst-filled and self-absorbed ramble...it starts out feeling that way. After 20 pages, I was hooked. With creativity, humor, and heart, Howie takes us through a woman's self-discovery and her meeting of herself. There were moments when I felt I had lost the storyline, but that was due to my concrete thinking rather than any fault of the author. She asks the reader to stretch reality, break out of the dictates of linear time and one-dimensional experience, and imagine an inner world as real and tangible as the one we usually think of as ""reality."" I loved the cat, Vinny, who gently encourages the narrator on her journey of self-discovery. I loved that Vinny, himself, ended up learning about self-acceptance, truth, and happiness. I recommend this book highly!"
4,Very Sturdy,"Ball is very sturdy and provides a great workout. Would have given it a five if the pump provided had not been so worthless. Threw it away after my first workout, which consisted entirely of trying to use the pump to blow up the ball. It wore me out and never got the ball inflated. Fortunately, I had a bicycle pump that worked well. But, the ball is great and you will be very satisfied with the ball."
5,Use as a chair,I'm glad I bought the largest one since I am using this as a chair and to stretch on. High quality and holds up nicely.
4,great,"i got this not for yoga but for sitting at my desk. there's nothing wrong with it, but it's just a bit too small for purposes of sitting at my desk. i'm 5'10"" and followed the measurements to get this 65cm ball, but too small. so i gave it to my sister. anyway, quality is great."
4,"love the ball, be prepared to buy a pump","The ball is great (I ordered it to replace my office chair). I ordered the 75cm, and it is indeed 75 cm (at full inflation, which I am finding difficult to achieve, since the damn pump has already broken). 4 stars because the pump was seemingly made by grumpy people that lack hands or glue. The part of the pump that enters the ball usually stays in the ball (and breaks away from the main body of the pump). So you have to yank that part out (breaking your fingernails while listening to the whoosh as all of your hard-won pumped air whooshes out of the ball). So I haven't actually gotten the ball to full inflation; I am awaiting delivery of a different (and hopefully better-made) pump. I will update when I have had the ball for longer."
1,NOT 75 CM,"just bought the 75cm Go Fit Proball. It was delivered quickly; however, when inflated, it is clearly not 75cm in diameter - though it's printed on the ball. In actuality, it's 55 cm. This is annoying."
1,Not too useful without a functional pump!,The ball itself seems like it would be nice and sturdy -- unfortunately you need to actually put air into it. The accompanying pump is completely non-functional. The only exercise we are going to have with the GoFit Stability ball is the effort it takes to return it.Update a week later: OK...finally found a different pump and managed to inflate the ball. I have to say the quality of the GoFit Ball is excellent. But I leaving them with one star -- as the pump you are paying for should actually work!
4,not as brilliant as some make it out to be,"OK first thing's first, I love the beta band. Secondly, they're a typical prog band. If you can imagine Stone Roses inviting Kraftwerk for an acoustic jam session (NOT an album recording though) you may get some idea of what this album is about.Standout tracks for ANYONE are Dry The Rain (of course), Inner Meet Me, She's the One, and Needles in my Eyes. Some of the other songs on the album are just too average and boring but good as background music when you're busy doing something.In some ways, the third album is more complete and much more accessible."
5,Beatles + Beck + RadioHead = BetaBand,Beatles + Beck + RadioHead = BetaBandI love this album. Can hardly get past the first half of the CD becuase it' s so good I keep listening over and over. Cannot wait to hear what's in store on the second half!
5,Al Rose's Storyville is a thorough and insightful account.,"In my research for a recent paper on the lives of prostitutes, I found this book indispensible, not only for its inclusion of interviews with actual Storyville prostitutes, or its thorough examination of the history and availiable statistics on the district, but also for the strange and beautiful photographs that are abundant in its pages. The expressions, attitudes, and settings the women and photographer chose say volumes about life in Storyville, as does Al Rose's wonderful book!"
4,Good value for lesser price,"This devise delivers good volumn, is very light weight and remains firmly my ear during my daily activities; A good value."
3,Best headset there is while it lasts...,"I absolutely ADORE this headset. It fits snugly in your ear without being uncomfortable, stays in place, sounds great, battery life is fine for normal use all day long. It took the tiniest bit of work to figure out the thingy that curls up inside your ear. Although it looks like it would be extremely uncomfortable, you can't even feel it in there. There's nothing to wrap around the outside of your ear, so it doesn't bind and it doesn't interfere with glasses or sunglasses. It's so light it just floats there.So why 3 stars? My first one, the Bluespoon AX, lasted about a month then overheated while charging and wouldn't stay on anymore. But, I loved it SOOOOOO much, I went out and bought a second one, this time the AX2. It lasted about 2 weeks and did exactly the same thing.Why, oh why, did they finally make a headset that truly fits in my life, and make it so poorly that it won't keep working??????"
1,Echo,"Had to return this one. It echos back to the the called party. My hearing isn't the best and I needed to run the volume all the way up. If I held it pushed in hard the echo goes away. The manual says to turn the volume down to eliminate echo. Great, but, then I can't hear. Ordering a model with the mike further away from the speaker."
1,stay away if u sre using T-Mobile MDA / T-Mobile SDA,Poor sound quality when paired with T-Mobile MDA / T-Mobile SDA.
5,Great educational take on a classic song.,"My daughter and I love reading, singing, and signing this song/book! Great way to teach kids more than one way to read and Sing."
5,#1 FAN SINCE THE BEGINNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IF THERE'S ANYBODY OUT THERE THAT DOESNT HAVE NELLY'S NEW ALBUM, IT'S A MUST THAT U GET IT. IF U LIKED HIS OTHER TWO ALBUMS-SWEAT AND SUIT-THEN I KNOW FOR SURE YOU'LL LOVE SWEATSUIT. THE NUMBER 1 TRACK FOR ME ON THE ALBUM IS GRILLZ. WHEN THAT SONG COMES ON, I GOTTA TURN IT UP CAUSE ITS SO CRUNK AND CAUSE I LIKE GRILLZ ALSO.HOLLA!!!!"
5,GRAEAT,I reallly like this cd!!!!!!! It so good I LOVE NELLY WITH A LL MY HEART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,only works with straight top tubes,"great looking rack. folds up small enough to keep in the trunk.HOWEVER, it only works well for straight top tubes and pretty much eliminates anything except road bikes. top tube adapters do not work well with this rack.Does not work well with over-sized tubed bikes. Large tubes simply do not fit into the slots."
1,The Sari Bones is Good but it Takes the Paint off your car,"If you own a car that you don't care about the paint, then this bike mount is perfect for you. However, if you have a car that you would like to preserve your paint job, then invest in a trailer hitch mount. I personally like my mount but I'm giving it a 1 because it is really tough on the car's paint job. Especially where the 6 rubber tipped connectors attach to different parts of the body of the car. There is a lot of strain on the paint due to the weight of the bikes. The rubber feet on the top and bottom of the center of the device is great but it too will eventually harm your paint. Giving it a 1 because of this."
5,Longhouse is Long Awaited,"The beautiful Guardian cover art is what got me to listen...but boy was I in for a treat - this group is incredible!! Extremely high quality sound, and I'm picky. There are few groups that come along like this one. Their sound is deep, rich, and meaningful. Their compositions are extremely unique in their non-standard song formats but each note intrigues and holds your interest, leaving you wanting to hear more, more, more! They draw your spirit into traveling and feeling alive, and nothing about this group is cheap-sounding. I've never heard this kind of music before (and I own almost every Native cd out there) - it has it's very own sound and I strongly commend them. All genres will be interested - from spiritual to upbeat, from contemporary to traditional, they've go it all in a new kind of blend. Wow - I was SO impressed! Telling all my friends and you! I bought everything they have. And it's timeless."
2,I Fell alot on Beginner Trails,"After watching this video, I fell on Beginners trails. I also almost died getting on and off the lift. I should sue the producer."
5,Great Christmas nostalgia for the 50+ generation: lovely!,"Amahl and the Night Visitors was a part of all of my early childhood Christmases, shown on the little family black-and-white TV in our 1950's, 1960's living room, and some years just aired on NPR on the radio (turned up loud on my dad's ""hi-fi"" so that we could listen to it in our beds.) For me and for many of my generation, this is the ultimate Christmas nostalgia item. I can still sing along to every word, and my grandchildren watched it over and over with me in fascination, pulled into the romantic story of the little crippled boy visited by the 3 kings on their way to the Christ child. Excellent sound quality and heart-wrenchingly beautiful voices."
3,DVD Quality - Amazon Verified Purchase,"I am aware that the opera itself was first produced back in the 50s, but I would have thought the quality of the DVD would have been much better."
4,Great Old Movie,I ordered this movie because I remembered watching it as a child. I told my children about it and wanted them to see it at least once.
1,Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors,"The Quality is tenth rate, this DVD is almost unwatchable and the audio sucks."
1,Not worth your time!,"Okay, so I read the bio on the series and thought I would like this anime. Boy, was I wrong. there are several cute episodes, but the story line is totally empty. Almost every episode is really sad, and in the end, the main character never reaches her goal. Everybody dies, and it is just aweful."
5,A Great Short Series,"I bought this series based on reviews and the description, and I'm not disappointed. The DVDs arrived on time in perfect condition. It's a short series that consists of two discs with short episodes (and a third disc with ova episodes and extras). I thought it was funny at the beginning, how everyone has all these problems and Yukito is in the middle of it all, without really caring, and how Misuzu randomly falls. (this is funny until later, but I won't give it away), but it all follows a strong storyline, basically about a winged girl in the sky who has bad dreams, and most of the characters goals, overall, are to find her and give her good dreams. It sounds a little stupid when you say it, but it makes sense in the manga. Anyway, I liked this series, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new anime to watch. However, it's very short, so if it's a long, dramatic series you're looking for, I would not suggest this."
1,Unplayable,Disc would not play here in Australia...due to wrong regional code. I suggest future offers of DVD's include warnings that some might not play in certain countries. I have had to return this item. W.Patey Queensland Australia
4,enjoyable quick read,"Haven't read many books by L'Amour, but what I have read, I've enjoyed. This was fast-paced, with all the usual elements - gunfights, Indians, intrigue, romance, survival - all tied together in a good story.Nice twist at the end.Not really sure where the name Heller comes from though??"
5,RAYMOND EDWARDS,I LIKE THIS BOOK SO WELL I WENT BACK IN TWO OR THREE PLACES TO MAKE SURE I REMEMBERED EVERYTHING ABOUT DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES OF STORY.
5,The definitve work on Irish traditional culture.,"This is the work that those of us who have been studying Irish traitional culture have been waiting for years for. As far as I know, there has never been a work like this published. This is an amazing encyclopedia of articles that are very thorough and are written by people with impressive professional expertise. If you've ever come across a term or topic in Irish music or dance that you wished for more information about, this is the place to find it. The extensive appendix is a very valuable collection of sources from every facet of the genre. This reference work is essential for any serious student of Irish culture. It is well worth the price."
5,I never put this romantic book away,This book stays on my coffee table because I use it all the time. It has changed my life because I've used it to cozy up every room in our home. It's made me fall in love with my home. I love the ideas that are shown in the pictures but really like the simple tips that the writer has emphasized which let me add romantic cottage touches to what I already own. I looked at other cottage books but they seemed too much about architecture or about rooms from Europe that don't look like my suburban home. This book has shown me that I can have a cottage wherever I live.
4,Helped define exact style I want,"This is the first interior Design book that I actually purchased & I thought it was well worth the price. It gave a broad overview of various ""cottage style"" interiors - everything from rustic cabin to English garden cottage to plain American farm house. I was able to get a much more focused idea of the look that I want to achieve. I'm taking this book with me while shopping for a few new furniture pieces in the next 12-18 months and I think it may have prevented a costly mistake."
2,Interdesign Clear Drainboard,"As nice as it looks, it was a disappointment. It doesn't slope to make the water drain into the sink, the edge is so sharp it cut my finger and last but not least, that ""tire rubber"" smell has not left after multiple washings. I've since been on the lookout for a better one."
1,Do not buy.,I hate this memory card I had been using for 3 months for Madden 2000 when it became corrupted.Do not get stick to the basic Nintendo pack.Don't mess around I have had a nintendo controller pack since I owned my nintendo 64 (about a year and half now) and have never had a problem.I tried to save a few bucks and got burned.
5,I truly believe it works when used properly,"When taken at the first sign of illness this product has helped me fend off a few colds and who knows what else.The key is to have it on hand and use it ASAP,drink plenty of water, eat well, you know the rest.It gives your immune system an added boost."
3,"It took a Long Time to get ""Inside the Ropes""","One of the more disappointing books by John Feinstein. He acts like the people putting on the 2002 U.S. Open were working on a cure for cancer. But seriously if the people described have all the abilities that Feinstein accredits them with, why aren't they doing something more meaningful than putting on a Golf Tournament. ALSO since I am a Huge Tiger Woods fan the usual Feinstein bashing of Tiger is not appreciated. One thing that surprised me is that NBC dictates pairings and starting times. If David Fay has all the integrity that Feinstein gives him credit for, he should not allow NBC to be so selective.Also, I remeber watching this event on the tube. And Feinstein does not capture the enthusiasm that New Yorkers displayed for Phil Mickelson. The Book does not mention that he was called ""The Mick.""The only question was how low to rate this book. Though unscientific 3 stars ""feels"" right."
2,A MAJOR ( PUN INTENDED) DISAPPOINTMENT,"I was so disappointed in this book. Having read most of Feinsteins other works. It was certainly not, "" Inside the Ropes"", as the sub title implies.I was totally bored by the business end of the open. Aside from the introduction, the golfers don t enter the book for about three hundred pages.I found myself skimming to get to the good stuff, which took a long time to materialize."
4,Good Inside look at the U.S. Open,"The author does a great job of taking the reader inside the historic 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, and includes all the main players involved. Be advised that the book does not focus much on the action at the Open, only the last 75-100 pages deal with the actual championship, the rest involves the story behind bringing the championship to the club. The book is a good read and will be enjoyed by any golf fan, not the best Feinstein has ever written, but one of his best."
1,A Good Open Spoiled,"The subtitle should be, ""Inside the Port-o-Johns at Bethpage Black,"" because Feinstein devotes many pages to the man who set up all those portable toilets that lined the golf course, every last one, even one that Tiger briefly did some business in! The guy who unloaded the Port-o-Johns off the truck is interesting for about a clause, but we get page after page of this guy. You'd think he was the Pope of Bethpage Black. If you want to know fascinating stuff like the PRECISE NUMBER of Port-O-Johns that actually lined the golf course, then attempt to burrow your way through Open. The playing of golf -- I'm talking about the first actual golf shot of the tournament -- doesn't make its first appearance until page 256. At that point, the book is more than two-thirds over!!!Feinstein phoned this one in. Did someone edit this? He should have called it, ""A Good Open Spoiled."" Don't waste your money."
2,"Good ideas, but horrible context","I praise Ostebee and Zorn for making an attempt to make calculus easy and for everyone. But I just don't think that is true. Calculus is a sophisticated form of mathematics and sometimes it needs to be taught with vocabulary and methods within the mathematics community and outside of everyday life. When you combine this with the usual high number of mistakes present in a first-edition book, a great deal of the phrase ""we'll discuss/define this soon"", excessive use of the graphing calculator, and some pretty lame jokes, you get a product that's not really worthy of being used in a college-level course."
3,High Volume of Typos,"This is not a literary review of Philip Roth's work, but of the quality of this digital translation. I'm only into about the first 50 pages or so, but got so annoyed with the high frequency of typos in this digital version that I felt compelled to bring it to Amazon's attention. I just bought my Kindle a few days ago and this is actually my first digital book I'm reading, so I have nothing to compare it to in terms of frequency, other than paper books, however, for the price that Amazon is charging to download these books, the quality of proofreading should be just as good or better! This is unexceptionable."
