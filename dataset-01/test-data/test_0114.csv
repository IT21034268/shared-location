3,"An interesting story, though probably fictional.","I'm amazed at the poor travel experiences Paul Theroux has. I've been to New Zealand three times so far, and I've had excellent experiences. The only folks I've met that are friendlier than the Kiwis are the Fijians. I'm not alone in my experiences, I've yet to meet someone who didn't love their trip to Fiji. I've read several of Theroux's books and decided that he either has the worst experiences, or makes things up. In Sunrise with Seamonsters he writes how he thought Henry Miller was a better write because Miller's supposed experiences were actually fiction. For a more realistic view of the South Pacific, read Mahina Tiare by Barbara Marrett and John Neal."
4,Good Sturdy Press,"My husband and I were very happy to see that this press is as sturdy as it is. It is very easy to use, comes apart for easy cleaning. Just make sure to use wax paper to get the patty out easier. We are not sorry for our purchase."
3,Good for pressing meat - but be careful!,"It is hard to find a quality non-sticking meat presser these days, and let me tell you, Weston delivers. My July 4 BBQ was a complete success thanks to Weston. Thanks, Weston!But not everything is bright and sunny with Weston Non-Stick Single Hamburger Press. Yes, it presses meat without that stick and smudge but it is at the price of danger and dismay. I got the wrong kind of meat stuck in my Weston the other day (I won't get too specific!), and I was very traumatized and suffered from extreme pain for several days. Please be careful using this product! It is not for children, and should only be used for hamburgers or circular-shaped hotdogs.All in all, Weston delivers. Great product. But please watch out!"
3,Not so much non-stick,The best part of this product is the changeable patty size. But it was a pain to clean because you have to take the whole thing apart. And the patty DID stick but after I figured out I really had to smack the patty together before putting it in there it did better.
4,This press is great,"I only have one complaint it should have been design with of a non stick surface, other than that I just cut out some wax paper and set them up for cook outs and put them away in the freezer which comes out great. I now save 1.50 per lbs doing it my self. My daughter loves pressing them for me which is even better."
3,Per la Gloria,"The CD was not quite what I expected, but did contain the music I wanted, albeit with piano, not orchestral accompaniment. But it is worth having and I am satisfied with Amazon's and the suppliers' service."
2,Don't buy if you just want your printouts to look right,"If you are looking for a practical, concise book explaining how to get the best possible match between what you seen on screen and what gets printed, this is NOT the book. It spends loads of time discussing background theory and how to create color profiles. Most people just don't need or want to get into this much detail or to control the process to this extent. If you just want to use color management tools and existing color profiles--which is at least 80% of us--this book is too long winded and not nearly practical enough. If you are in the elite 20%, this is a great book (see the glowing reviews for details)."
3,Specifically designed for very high-end professionals,"Unless you have a few thousand bucks to throw at profiling and calibrating software and the accompanying measuring instrument or two don't waste your time on this book, it is just too high-end for the average, discriminating color dabbler or even mid-grade designer on a budget."
1,Sticky Mess,"Every single candy in every single bag was a sticky mess, inside and outside the wrappers. Will never buy from this vendor again!!!"
5,I am in Shangri-la,"I am in Shangri-la every time I hear this recording! It is beautiful, and I go to sleep to it every night. My only regret is that I often do not get to hear the end because I am asleep before then. Soft, shimmering, tranquil-- everything that our modern existence usually is not-- it transports me into another world. There is not a single note of discord in it. I considered buying another album using Tibetan bowls but was disturbed when I heard the sample selections because there were discordant, wierd ""New Age"" elements of modern music piercing it. I am happy to say that there is none of this sort of thing in this album. It is nothing but the bowls, played by an expert hand, and that is just what I wanted. I'm sure that those seeking a background for meditation, rather than sleep would find it helpful too-- it does not put me to sleep because it is boring, but because it is so peaceful."
3,"postscript to useful, but flawed","if you are looking for a book of this type, i recommend jeremy harmer's how to teach english (isbn# 0-582-29796-6). this is also the one used by cambridge celta courses. i can also recommend jeff mohamed's teaching english overseas: a guide for americans and canadians, which is chock full of useful information about the dynamics of getting yourself abroad and employed. viel Gl√ºck!!"
1,Is he dead or something?,"Isn't it about time for a new album from Mo_zart(where's the first ""t""). Not impressed."
4,Blasts From My Past,"I am very pleased with my purchase of the Big Hits of the 80s. I purchased this for my daughter. She said it took her back to her childhood days. Each song evoked a memory. The sound quality is excellent. The complilation of songs is fairly representative of the period. However, there were a couple of unfamiliar songs that could not be found on any ""Hits of the 80s"" lists. Despite this, my daughter and I still recommend this purchase to others interested in 80s music."
3,A very limited story.,"Robert Bacon's story is fine up until his time in World War I. I thought I would learn a lot about Bacon's adventures during World War I but he was limited in what he could tell his wife in the letters. All you learned is that war is difficult and he would rather be with his wife than in a war zone. His early career is handled well by the author. Finding books about this Secretary of State is very limited.John NavarraDaytona Beach, Florida"
3,cat likes to stick head inside,"my cats never scratch this. still scratch the carpet. I put catnip on it and they just lick it. They do, however, enjoy sticking their heads through the hole on the side. it's pretty amusing."
2,Not Quite the Book I Thought it was....,"This wasn't quite what I was looking for, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. Just not for me. A bit boring....."
1,Flawed Design,"This comes equiped with a feature that requires the bin to be properly in place before the unit will operate. Sounds good, right? Only problem is the bin does not fit smoothly into place. From our first use, we had trouble getting the bin to line up with the safety switch and it never did seem to fit right. It seemed necessary to force the bin into place to get the on switch to make contact. Needless to say, after only 2 times of emptying the bin, the switch broke and the shredder would no longer even turn on. Target no longer carries Royal but traded me straight across for an Embassy brand which seems to have a much better design."
1,Promises not kept...,"The Introduction states, ""there is a dichotomous key to plant families included""... but don't believe it; and a good key would really be a helpful addition! You better know your plant families (as previously stated by an earlier reviewer) quite well before I would recommend this book. The map in this book indicates it's focused on Canada and North Dakota - although the book does indicate on a general map that ""some"" of the included plants range quite widely to the east past Lake Ontario, south into Missouri and Kansas, and west into Idaho and Utah. The text doesn't clarify which of the plants these are however."
2,The Pattern,"When I ordered this tablecloth it looked very pretty in the picture but when I received it you hardly see the pattern, but it was made very good. Just disappointed. Maybe if they had put a fancy border around it would have help, not really for the home maybe for commerical use I should have return it but couldn't find the receipt."
4,A Great Introduction to Satie,"It takes a very fine sense of balance to play Satie correctly, to avoid ruining the score by being either overly sonorous or overly energetic. Aldo Ciccolini cuts just the right line, picking a well-balanced middle ground.Aside from delivering one of the better performances of 'Trois Gymnopedies', Ciccolini offers both an invigorating version of 'Jack in the Box', as well as a suitably loopy rendition of 'Le Balle Excentrique'. All in all, a great introduction to Satie, and one that may be enough for most."
3,Erik Satie/Seraphim Classics,"This is an analogue recording, the recording date is not given. The sound quality is excellant and some of the pieces are performed well; however, his perforfance of the Gymnopedies on EMI catalogue #67282 is superior."
2,"Repetitive, annoying toy","It seems like a great toy, and it does deliver with lights, sounds, and nice renditions of kids songs. It has a nice concept of growing with your child, too, offering new functionalities based on age.Unfortunately, where it falls very short is the repetitive voice that says to press a button. Most other electronic toys have an automatic shut off, rather than use a voice to remind you to push a button over and over again. It's unfortunate, but it's a significant design flaw that's annoying to parents and kids. Ours is gathering dust.For its high price, I cannot recommend this item."
1,author is one unhappy man,I think the author would have been unhappy regardless of the color of the family he grew up in. We all have issues to deal with and decisions to make about how we perceive them. If you are looking for a book on trans-racial adoption look some where else.
5,Book of my soul,"Jaiya John very articulately expresses what it's like to be adopted by parents who are not the same color as him. As a black woman adopted by white parents, he expressed things that I thought but never had the words to express.Yes it's true, there are bits of the story that might be depressing or seem like a pity party, but it comes from his 10 year old perspective. I love this book. I call it the book of my soul because I feel like I could have written it.I have felt different my whole life because they people I love and call my family don't look like me. No matter how much we love each other the world doesn't always understand or accept. It's cute when they are babies, but what happens when the children grow up.Please read it's very enlightening!"
5,"""Catholicism Wow!""","See ""DOGMA"". See ""DOGMA"" again. Then see ""DOGMA"" again. Then you will see the light and have to buy your own ""BUDDY CHRIST""The future?The Second Coming of ""DOGMA""!"
2,Can't Mount on dashboard,"It's a nice little statue. But it doesn't include a mount for the dashboard. So you have to invent your own. I haven't solved this problem. This isn't exactly what I expected. And I'm disappointed I can't cruise down the road singing,""I don't care if it rains or freezesLong as I got my plastic JesusSitting up on the dashboard of my car......."""
4,Looks great on the dashboard,Its hard not to smile and give him a thumbs up back. He's ridden on my dash for many many miles.
4,Great picture......Poor design,"Owned about 2 years before it went caput. The unit is not sealed like many other higher end projectors, so dust can get inside. This can be very annoying as one piece of dust covers a big area and is very noticeable on a 120' screen. The bulb cannot be tightened to tight or the bulb casing will rub against the color wheel, as it did in my case, cauing holes in the glass color wheel and loss of color. Was fun while it lasted and looked great, just need to improve design."
5,Awesome,This is a great Concert on DVD! It has been shown on PBS and is a great quality concert with almost all of my favorite songs. Great DVD!!!
2,Buy this antenna if you don't mind dropouts.,"I bought this antenna for my Pioneer GEX-P910XM tuner in my car. I like the profile of the antenna, but I have had many dropouts. I have an XM Commander with the mini antenna and have had few dropouts. This antenna is not even worth the $14 that I paid for it. I don't know if its defective or what, but I would not recommend this antenna to anyone. Visit XMFAN.com before buying any XM radio equipment, the people there willl be willing to help you make a good decision."
1,Death Race down memory lane,30 years ago this movie was the coolest thing a kid could see on late night cable. What an absolutely terrible flic!! Even the nude scenes are bad! Thank God for Jason Statham!!!
5,Carmaggedon the movie.,"Yes a movie so cultish that a video game was based on the themes and car designs. I'm talking about Carmaggedon 1,2 and 3. Movies that causes such creations are truly magical. If you are a fan of the Carmageddon series this is must see movie for you. Yes at times the movie can be chessy but thats what makes it a classic. No its not a Blade Runner style setting but the plot line seems that way dealing with population control by supporting a race to kill citizens. Thats what the people in Soylent Green should have thought up instead of eating the people or they could of just ran the people over in this race and eat them. It seems the movies of the 70s spent alot of time with the concept of over population, the anarchy of youth gone wild against social justice (Clockwork Orange). Oh well do you a favor and buy this movie and then buy Carmageddon for the full effect."
4,Definitly a must for cheese-ball sci-fi fans..,Definitly better than I had anticipated! Both David Carradine and Sly Stallone ham it up as their respective charcters Frankenstein and Machine Gun Joe. The Gore is there and the required T&A for a 70's schlock film. Should not be overlooked!
5,Best Satire of American Consumer Society up to Romero's Dawn of the Dead,"This David Carradine vehicle (pun intended) directed by Paul Bartel of 'EATING RAOUL' fame, is the best sci-fi/action/black comedy of all time. Anyone looking for serious violence or gore should go elsewhere (but there's PLENTY of over the top tongue-in-cheek blood & action). Long out of print, I look forward to seeing what SHOUTfactory does with the property-their treatment of MST3K has been outstanding so far! (UPDATE-the SHOUTfactory Roger Corman series of reissues are ALL very sharp with interesting bonus features-any Corman/New World fan should buy them all!)"
5,Wow...,"When I was a kid and saw this film I thought that it was the greatest...Wow have things changed! Bad acting, terrible movie plot but still hysterically FUNNY!"
5,The best Stalone Movie you never saw.,This is one of my favorite movies. This is an instant cult classic. This is a crude movie with bad lines and an unlikely sport. I think it is just fun and wish they still put out films like this.
4,Good Book**!!,"Bush is a fantastic president and this book is the perfect description of his presidency. these liberals who are writing these reviews probably havent even read the book! they are just using it as a way to make fun of our president! anyways, the book looks really good even though I only read a couple chapters.**:-)Tanya<-:**"
3,Sun and BBQ,The vaults of CAPITOL records swing open to provide 10 original recordings with a solar theme on MUSIC FOR A SUMMER BARBEQUE. Sound quality of this budget-priced CD is excellent.
3,Disappointed with Defective Green Genie,"I love the Karen Voight workouts, so I was excited to start using the Green Genies which I ordered a little over a week ago. The item arrived via FedEx last night and the package was in good condition. When I opend the package, the DVD inside was also in excellent condition. To my disappointment, one of the Green Genies felt lighter than the other one, as if it had lost some of the sand out of it. It also felt kind of saggy whereas the other weight felt solid when I held it. I am returning the kit today and I hope that Amazon will refund my money without a problem. I am a bit diappointed as I have several other of the Karen Voight workouts and I love them. They really keep me motivated and have helped me to get back into the fitness regimen after the birth of my daughter 10 months ago."
2,not such a great buy,"I bought this DVD with the idea of getting more deeply into the Mahabarata. The acting is poor, a third grader could do better special effects. There is a lot of spoken Hindi with very little english subtitle. After the second disc I changed my mind about purchasing their version of the Ramayana. This is a very poor product. It's better than nothing at all, but not much."
5,Great product,"I love this product for my dog. Everyone always comments on how SOFT her coat is and how healthy she looks. She has a history of a broken leg, so we purchased the joint support version of the Nupro and couldn't be happier. She loves the taste when we sprinkle it on her dry food and add a little water to make a gravy. The price on this purchase was very good; will buy again."
5,Best Product Ever,"This product took about 10 days to kick in, and when it did it worked wonders. We were worried that our dog was going to need hip surgery, now she is running and jumping like she did when she was a puppy. HIGHLY recommend this product."
4,for its size not bad,"First off I want to say that I love this product. I have only had it for a few days but it has been great, It is small and it gets to a decent level in regard to the sound level. I work in a guard both and it fills the whole thing up. In fact I have to turn It down if it is at its max. The only real complaint that I have with this product is that it is designed like every thing else for the Ipod. Meaning, that the jack is in the center. My mp3 player has it on the right hand side so it is a bit off centered."
2,Macally Podwave Portable Stereo Speakers,Not loud enough. Battery doesn't last long enough. Maybe they will improve but right now don't buy.
2,"Low volume, but works for me....","I got this because I listen to audiobooks all the time. Needed something around the house, etc. It's not easy to find something this small that I can use with my IAUDIO U2 (great product!) - Got it at Circuit City for 39.99 which I felt was overpriced, but I was desperate. As soon as I plugged it in, I noticed that it was VERY quiet - even when cranked up all the way. Hard to hear in the car. But I find that it works at the desk and around the house. And audiobooks work good with it. So for my purposes, it works out fine. Depends on what you're gonna use it for. I recommend getting the cheapest price though."
3,Acceptable sound,"I got this speaker for my Sansa MP3 player, for when I'm cycling. The volume is not great, but acceptable. I can hear it from the handlebars, altho road noise can tend to drown it out. Hanging from a chest strap, I can hear it, and my buddy next to me can hear a bit of music.To be able to listen to my music while riding, without infringing on other riders or walkers, is good. It keeps my ears free of earbuds so I still hear oncoming trafic, and other sounds I need to hear while riding.It does tend to go thru batteries, but I am going to start using rechargeables."
1,Waste of Money,"Please dont waste your money on this thing, the sound is very faint even when turned up to the max and you'll go through alot of batteries just to use it."
2,WTF,"one time use I guess...1st time worked ok, 2nd time nothing. there is no off switch so my thinking is if there is no power going to the device it should not drain the batteries if i leave it plugged in.....WRONG...not portable but disposable. but it is my fault for getting something cheap...won't happen again! can't put new batteries everytime i go to use it and not pulling batteries out everytime either."
4,not too bad considering the size,"This tiny set of speakers play fairly decent for their size. I don't expect miracles here and the fact that they can do what they do is impressive especially for under $10 now. Some background here, I am an audio type with large tower speakers (100lbs each, planar-magnetic hybrids driven by a 70lb multichannel amp) and have listened to many speakers from near-field studio monitors to very high end audiophile products. So I can say that I'm pretty discerning with sound but fair as well.The best comparison I have is this sounds EXACTLY an average pair of laptop speakers with slightly less bass. Not a high end ""multimedia"" laptop with a name brand speakers and/or a sub but very much like my work Dell Latitude speakers. Coming from something that small, that's pretty good. And when you are strapped for space, this thing is hard to beat."
1,Horrible sound quality,"The sound quality is horrible. Only one volume control and that is ""on"". The volume is so low it is hardly audible. It doesnt help that the speakers are on the ends of the unit and not in the front where you might hear them. Buy only with the attitude I had, Im not out that much money if its quality is low. You will be out your money !"
4,Macally Podwave Portable Stereo Speakers for iPod,"It wasn't too loud, but it's great for when you're doing your homework or something..."
1,Poorly packaged. No packing.,"This was incredibly packed without any cushioning material. It arrived in a dozen pieces, and was returned as soon as they sent me a shipping label."
3,Disappointing Ending,"This book was a page turner and I did enjoy it, but it left unresolved issues and ended terribly. It would have been okay if it led you to believe there would be a sequel, but it did not."
1,Dimentions???,"Sure would be nice to know the dimentions of this thing. And I'm kind-of curious about the ""Set of 12"". If I was to order this, would I really get 12 chalkboards? Maybe if I was opening up a Dart Bar (do those exist?). Please describe this item better and I might consider buying it. Ugh."
2,"Gimmicky, but Where's the Substance?","The title of this book, NEW IDEAS ABOUT NEW IDEAS really grabbed me.Behind all that, and a lot of jargons, what could readers like me reallyget out of that? No eye-opening creativity skillsets or practical, well-thought out case studies on innovations to share,nor clear-cut author's perspective on creativity and innovations.The ideas in book are fuzzy, jumping from here and there, complicating rather than simplifying things for the readers.Buyers be aware! In the New Economy, here comes a lot of Innovations or Creativity Gurus, who wrote books, but hardly have any solid practical and theoretical backgrounds on Innovations or Creativity. So many writers want to cash out from such a Creativity and Innovation Boom.Read classics like"" Whack the Side of Your Head"", ""Technique For Producing Ideas"", ""Serious Creativity"", ""Aha"", and ""Conceptual Blockbusting"" to save your hard-earned dollars, my friends!"
2,Beware! This is nothing new!,The performances are great (hence the stars) BUT it is simply two previously issued CDs (Camelot/My Fair Lady and Tara's Theme/Jealousy) in a wooden box. There are no additional liner notes or anything (which is why it's two stars and not five) -- just two individually shrink-wrapped CDs. Buy them separately -- it's cheaper and you won't miss anything but the wood box.
1,Not Natural,Love the smell and feel but very disappointed that this uses CANCER causing parabens. I made the mistake of thinking this was only organic and natural which it is not. I wll NEVER buy another product from the manufacturer.
2,bad sound,"Can't recommend this recording, the sound is just terrible. But Sutherland voice is spectacular here, of course."
4,nat king cole cd,"this was a wonderful CD, I play it all the time and it arrived as described and on time. thanks"
1,Do not reflect reality!Outdated!,"This book is outdated. It was published in 1980. As an elemnetary school teacher I do not think this is an appropirate book for kids.To begin with, every student should be represented, and accurately, in the literature used. Negative images and inaccurate stereotyping of people and cultures in children's fiction books is harmful to students whose ethnicity is being portrayed. Students should be able to see themselves and their lives reflected in the books they read. When you look at the illustrations at that book for example the page where the clothes are shown it doesn't reflect the reality. Even though it looks like a multi cultural book it is based on streotypes."
2,unhappy,"I am not to happy with this item. Only had it maybe a month and it only seems to toast on one side, have to put on darker than I would usually, to get it just right. I wish I saw the reviews before I bought it because I wouldn't have."
2,Sad Cheap Plastic,"We had previously owned a Sunbeam for many years without a problem. But We needed a larger toaster. So we decided to try this 4 toast toaster, but right out of the box you could feel the cheapness. The first time we used it, it smelled like burning plastic. So we sent it back. The other problem was the levers which must have been broken, as well , because we had regular bread to toast and when it came up the toast was still down inside- even after raising the lever manually it still 90% in the toaster! Very disappointed will not recommend this to anyone."
5,So convenient!,"I love with this boxed tofu I can have it on hand at anytime and not risk spoilage (or space) in the fridge! I've used it in soups, stews, stir fries, pan-fried and deep-fried tofu dishes. It's a softer than the fresh tofu in the store but does the job! I go through phases where I eat lots of tofu or none at all, so the long shelf-life factor has been really important to me. I usually buy the firm or extra firm for what I am cooking, but the soft and medium versions are great too depending on what you are cooking."
4,Pretty Funny,This is a pretty good book; easy reads and fun stories. There's one about Vin Diesel that you'll tell your friends about. I suggest picking it up.
2,Predicatble,Was excited to read it after all the hype around the Swedish crime genre but was super unimpressed. Wallanders character is boring and the whole story is predictable and you are just kept busy reading what you already know is going to happen.
4,An accomplished debut by a promising young Irish poet.,"Chief among the book's pleasures are its acuteness of observation, its accurate evocation of rural and urban Ireland and its verbal wit. Wheatley's is a new voice in Irish poetry: gentle, quizzical and urbane. Especially enjoyable were ""Landscape with Satellite Dish,"" ""At a Yuan Play"" ""Alba"" and ""A Skimming Stone, Lough Bray."" This is a thoughful, formally accomplished and beautifully produced first book by a young Irish writer of great promise. Warmly endorsed."
3,Swabs were ok.,"Product was ok. Not high quality, the swabs were a bit dry, not enough iodine in each individual pack. After swabbing few times felt dry."
3,Alright,"The metal of the earrings almost overwhelms the small stones. They're pretty, but look a little naked. For the price though, a decent buy."
4,Philips PH61071 Component-Video,"I bought these cables to upgrade from my previous no name very cheap one, to see if i would get better quqlity.The truth be told, there was no diffrence but im using it anyway, after all, brand name sometimes gives u peace of mind.The Cable is very reasonable priced, dosent look to appealing but it does the job...."
4,"It is a cable, and it works","I know that analog cables are the one area where it sometimes is justified to spend the big bucks on Monster Cables, but c'mon, they are cables. It just makes no sense to spend half the amount of money on the cable as you do on the hardware you are connecting.These cables are currently serving up a fine picture from my DVD player to my Sharp 1080p HDTV. They are nice and thick, seem quite durable, and they work. What more does one need?"
2,"Not for your typical pre-teen ""Idol"" fan","I purchased the clean version of this CD hoping my whole family could enjoy it. We were huge fans of Constantine Maroulis on American Idol. I generally pre-screen new CD's before giving them to my 11-year-old daughter. I wan't completely surprised that this would not pass my test -- if it has both an explicit and clean version I already wonder. The band has never pretended to be anything other than a metal band, so that was no surprise either. Let's just say that we'll wait for Constantine's solo CD to come out -- the one that might contain ""My Funny Valentine"" and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" on it -- before my daughter gets her own copy. Until then, my closet head-banger husband can enjoy our copy of Pray for the Soul of Betty."
4,Helps my back.,I mainly got it for my back and it is holding up under some good pressure. I wish it came along with a booklet or some ideas on exercises to do with it.
2,Bridge Humor,"A humorous story about a couple of low-life newlyweds from the 1920s who decide to take up bridge to raise their social standing (wife's idea). Amusing stories told from husband's point of view about his unconventional play and attempts to swindle the upper class at this game. When he sacrifices in 8 clubs doubled the opponents claim 100 points, but he counter-claims 60 for honors and 100 for making the grand. Warning - this book will not improve your bridge play."
2,Expensive and short on performance,"I had to return the detector. The button was too hard to press. It also has too blunt of a point so you can not push it into the ground. The return was a little painful. Return instructions were hard to follow, but I finally succeeded."
4,wonderful,"I love Scott Sonnon's work. I love his focus, his explanation, his presence. And I love whathis videos do for me. My body has gotten more flexible and stronger than with any otherworkout. I feel younger and more supple, and have lost weight.Unlike so many others who purport to be experts in the field, Sonnon really knows his stuffand communicates it efficiently and powerfully. This is a good workout for anyone, beginnerthrough advanced. It really gets you ""in the flow"". Highly recommended."
3,The sweep of history,"I enjoyed this story, which carried its protagonist through the years of the Russian Revolution and the Jazz Age. The book has a lot of interesting things to say about architecture, and the portrayal of Finland is certainly compelling.The author's execution, however, left something to be desired: Some of the supporting characters are stereotypes, the dialogue was a trifle trite, and the story gets bogged down in rehashing certain doomed relationships. This book certainly could have been better."
4,Nice Piece of Modern Fiction,"I have to admit I picked this book up first because of my Finnish ancestry. Nobody seems to give a darn about Finland, so it was fun to find something to relate to.By in large I found the book compelling, it kept me turning pages and wondering what happens next. I thought quite a bit about who I'd like to pass it on to next, (my architect friend? my mother?) and that tells me I have to recommend this book.The Cloud Sketcher is a bit dark, filled with tragedy after tragedy, and I at times grew frustrated with the protagonist, Esko Vanannen; however, I thought throughout that the book was written solidly."
5,Renegade season one,Quite possibly the best TV show ever. Its realistic and gritty depiction of a cop wrongfully accused of a crime he didn't commit both inspired and moved me.After watching this I felt a connection with Reno and it left me feeling touched by him.
2,The Singers vs The Score,"Interesting mix of reactions to this somewhat creaky recording. My 2-star, ""feh"", is not based on the singing, which is quite good (to say the least) . . . and if that's why you buy these things, you'll probably be relatively happy here . . . but on the fact that (a) the opera has been slashed like cheap goods after Xmas; and (b) the performance has all the drive of a Studebaker running on 1 cylinder. If you are interested, therefore, in ""Les Huguenots"" as an opera in every facet, youwill be disappointed.Much more rewarding, although the singing is not at Sutherland-Corelli level (although the cast is not exactly a throw away)- is the difficult to find French/Erato live (Montepellier) performance that is truly exciting to listen to - great visceral drive and panache by all involved - and is note complete (on 4 discs)!! THIS is why Huguentos was one of the great hits of the 19th century.Depends on why you listen to opera."
2,don't bother,"I am using this product now as it seemed like a good idea at the time, but I would not have purchased it if I had put some thought into it. Firstly and I think this is a bit dangerous for exclusively breastfed babies, the ounces are off on the storage bags. I know I placed 3oz in the most recent bag but it comes up as 6oz in on the bag. This is not good especially if mom is not home and a caregiver might be fooled into believing they have enough milk on hand. Secondly, the storage bags are expensive. Ziploc snack size bags are much cheaper and I am going to try those to see if they fit so I can as least make the most of the small spaces."
2,Returned...,"We got new ceiling tiles in my office and I lost reception of my favorite radio station.. I bought several different Amplified Antenna including this one... All together they were mostly about the same.. I returned this one because it was larger and more expensive than the other smaller ""Terk Pi"" I bought at my local best buy for $40... which worked just as good... I still don't don't have a decent signal but it helped a little."
5,Big Improvement!!,My new house is in a terrible reception area. I have a battery of assorted amplified antennas and none of them did diddly. The Terk FM-50 was the next best alternative to a roof mounted TV antenna with a rotor. Am very happy with this product.
1,Don't be bamboozled,"Installation and use of this FM antenna actually degraded the reception of my favorite NPR station, which is a low-powered broadcast from a local university. The antenna pulls in radio stations from distant cities that broadcast on the same frequency as my local favorite just fine, but the result is an unsatisfactory, irritating, garbled mix of at least three radio signals from my speakers. The windshield antenna on my car, when parked in the driveway outside, never fails to pick up this favorite station perfectly clearly in comparison. I got the best results just connecting my radio with the 75 ohm to 300 ohm converter jack included with the antenna and leaving the antenna and its coax cable out of the picture altogether. I could have bought that component at the local Radio Hut for peanuts."
1,Didn't work for me.,I want to give a fair review on this product but I must say it seems Amazon could have done a much better job securing the package. When it was sent the antenna box was not taped. All it had to secure it was the strings that wrap around plastic buttons to hold the box together. So the product may have been damaged in shipment but Amazon could not send another for me to try as at the time they were out of stock. I tried the product with and without the amplifier and noticed absolutely no difference. I tried it in different places in my home as well. It just did not work for me at all. Sent it back for a refund. I still have not found a good antenna.
1,Not any help at all,"I have found this antenna of very little help at all with HD radio signals on my Sangean HDT-1X. The amplifier does absoulutely nothing. As is the case with most amplified antennas. The noise created by the amp somtimes causes interference. I am an experienced tech who does install low voltage system for a living and have done so since 1980. I have this up high in attic and I get pretty good reception I do not get the vast majority of NYC HD stations. I do live a good distance away from NYC in NJ approx. 60 miles. Depending on the area you live and distance from towers I would say to take that into consideration, and if possible go to an outdoor if possible which will give the best reception. The key as with any antenna is height, and good quality cable use RG6 or better."
3,superflirt,its a good book for the public in general but for the specialist reader its too simple and without any references to make a better research on the subject in special
3,"It came in perfect, but the case was cracked","I got this for my brother for Christmas b/c it was what he told me that he wanted. It came in fine, but the case where you open it was broken. I don't know if it just got banged around during shipping or what, but I was a litle upset. My brother didn't care though, so it's all good."
3,"Right size, not thick enough","I was looking for the perfect fit for my new jumbo litter boxes with lids. Needed extra large and the size is perfect but my kittens have sharp claws, too sharp for thin plastic. If it doesn't hold, what's the point? If all cats were declawed this would be a fine bag for the job."
3,Middle of the pack,Not great writing and the ending is a little disjointed and abrupt. Three stars - just average maybe the subsequent ones will get better
4,Gypsy flamenco Romeo & Juliet,"I would have gotten more out this with English subtitles, but my Spanish isn't bad and there is still plenty to get. For me it was all about the dancing; oh sure, there's the family feud, and star-crossed lovers and the beat lifestyle of this subculture, but what really animates the story is the passionate and frenetic stamping and strumming that goes on. So while the story marches on to its inevitable tragic outcome, what is really interesting and essential here is the character of the people revealed in their dancing. Eso es!"
5,She loves it,I bought this for my mom. She says it still smells the way it did years ago when she used to wear it. She was soooo happy with it! Great price too.
3,Unicorn Goblins!,"This was a surprisingly good movie. An old friend and myself watched this really late one night. Neither of us are really into any sort of horror films, so needless to say it did unnerve us quite a bit. We nicknamed these sharks ""Unicorn-Goblin sharks"" because of they're odd appearances. The CGI was disappointing, but other than that it was a good movie, as far as killer shark films go."
2,"Oh my god, really","this would have been a really good movie if the sharks were not goblin sharks, any other types of sharks and acting is not that good, I mean come on really goblin sharks, and to top it off the sharks look so fake(duh) everything is so CGIed to death."
5,Great product works well.,"Not much to write other than it shipped fast, worked well, and works perfect for what my intended use is for."
3,"A good starter set, great case, and a bargain price","As with other reviewers I would agree that this is a good set to start you off, and the case will serve as a good home for better harps and you buy them.Try it out. As you find the keys that suit your needs replace the original cheap harps with better quality ones, but keep the originals for the keys that you don't use too often.I'm very happy with this purchase."
3,Fun to play with but kinda cheap,"It's worth $20 just for the nice case and to have harps in keys like B flat that you might not normally own. These harmonicas are actually not bad, but they're made out of cheap plastic and are super light. No one has yet mentioned that they smell and taste like plastic when you play them, though. I hope the smell goes away.They are much quieter than metal harmonicas, so they're good for practicing. You can definitely bend notes no problem, but the high notes squeak easily. The light weight is also good for keeping one in your pocket."
3,"good t start with, but not rugged enough","My wife bought me this set (Minus the bonus hurricane harp) from a local music store in Ohio. She is a not too bad Karaoke singer at our local club, and I cant carry a tune vocally to save my life, so she bought these for me to learn with.The sound is OK, but they weren't very rugged as I learned how to play them.(notes would change, and sometime the reeds would just quit producing sound after prolonged use) Of course this may be my fault(due to ""rookie"" abuse), but I replaced them with Hohner Blues Harps, and the problem didnt repeat on the better harps. I also noted that the printing on the back plastic wore off fairly quickly, as well as the note designators. (Had to etch the key into the plastic)However, the case alone is in my humble opinion worth the price. Fits the Blues Harp just fine. Thus the 3-star rating"
1,Hohner harmonicas strictly for amateurs,"This is a nice package but the harps are very poorly made. They are some sort of composite material. The screws fell out of two of them in two weeks and the key ""imprint"" wore off two. They are very lightweight. I like Hohner but not this package"
2,Cheap Toy,"Cheap toy. Low volume and low quality tone. Cheap, lightweight plastic. Requires more wind than a normal harmonica. If you have ANY experience playing harmonicas or are a musician in ANY capacity spend the money for a better set. If you are looking for a toy for a child to play with you found it."
2,I should have returned it...,"Some of the harmonicas were fine, but a few of them came with broken reeds. In addition, the harmonicas didn't last very long at all. I thought it was too troublesome to return it, so I continue to use some of them for practice, but of the seven harmonicas, only two work well now."
2,don't be fooled by the good reviews,"first let me start out by saying that I am a beginner. I bought these harmonicas so that I can learn on them, however that's not the case. They are not air tight, some notes do not want to play and it takes a lot of air to get something out of it. Also, these harps are made in china and the quality hohner harps are made in germany. Oh, the case is nice."
3,Inexpensive Harps,"A needed a set of spares in several keys, and couldn't resist the price. These are a lot harder to play than better quality harmonicas. The low notes require extra effort and some of the reeds are sticky. The case is nice. A reasonable value for the price."
3,Ok harps for jamming. Not great if your serious about performing,"Ok harps for jamming. Not great if your serious about performing. Good sounds, butnot quality made. Also not the best key selection, but that was my not reading the adwell."
1,"He calls it an ""Encyclopedia"", but it's not comprehensive.","When I first saw this book on the shelf, I was very happy. I have been an avid movie-goer and movie-lover for years, and the only other Movie Encyclopedia I had was several years old. Unfortunately, when I got this book home I realized that MANY names were misssing. For example, Pamelyn Ferdin who was in a Clint Eastwood movie called ""The Beguiled"" in 1971. It seems there is no consistency regarding who he includes in this book, and who is left out. It should be ALL or nothing."
1,Urgently needs updating,"An exceptional compendium, invaluable source of information and research, this work nonetheless needs an updating. Unless the reader is consulting entries prior to the early nineties, the book is useless."
3,"The bad, and the not so good","I am a biochemistry student; Analytical Chemistry by Christian is a required text for the lecture portion of my techniques in chemistry. I wouldn't be that harsh on this book if not for the fact that the lab portion of the class requires Quantitative Chemical Analysis by Harris. When comparing the two texts the Harris book is more detailed, through and clear. Now, the Christian text is okay, it does teach you the necessary procedures of problem solving. I find those procedures somewhat elementary. The practice problems have no depth to them. It's an Okay buy, I would rather spend my money on the Harris book though."
4,Great story,"I am looking forward to another movie by Vondie Curtis Hall. Gridlock'd had a great anti-bureaucracy plot and was well acted by three wonderful actors, Thandie Newton, Tim Roth, and the late great Tupac Shakur. There were a few dragging moments, but they are easily overlooked. I was too busy wondering what was going to happen next!"
5,Tupac N' Roth Made This Look Good,"Tim Roth And Tupac Amaru Shakur Are Just Kicking It In This Movie! There No Doubt About It, Tupac Will Be Missed Both As A Rapper And As An Actor."
1,this movie is a waste of time.,"this movie has to be the worst i have ever seen dont purchase this movie. its only bout drugs and violence , its not a good movie trust me , i wasted my money on this movie."
2,Not worth the price,"I have read McMillan's other books and found them interesting and educational. But this book does not have any eyeopening material. If you are a beginner in options then this is not for you; if you are not a beginner then this book is not for you also. You probably know how volatility affects option prices etc., The author has just filled the pages with many historical charts of stocks. Instead he could have just illustrated his points with a couple of charts for each topic. Instead of a book this just deserves to be a booklet."
4,my statement,I liked this book a lot. this is a story about a girl named kristine who gets a puppy for her birthday. a lot of funny and interesting things happen through the book.
1,Caveat Emptor,"I purchased this for work back in March this year. After less than 5 months with usage maybe a few times a day, this Canon LS-100TS calculator is completely dead. Despite having solar power, leaving it on the windowsill for a day failed to get any response from it. I'd send it back, but the cost involved both in postage and effort is more than this calculator is worth. I thought Canon was a reliable brand - one of the factors in my choosing this calculator - but apparently not in this case. Waste of money - choose something else."
2,Poor build quality,"I've used many calculators at work and they have all managed to last a fair amount of time. These survive 2-3 months before the buttons start failing and they need constant resetting. Resets work for a couple hours. Battery life is weak, solar doesn't pull through in low light. The frame does not sufficiently protect the circuit board inside. I've found the circuit board cracked from just being dropped. I have used over ten units of this model and these are not isolated issues."
1,lousy,"I've had this for 10 months, haven't used it much, mainly just copying discs or burning files on them. I'm really sorry I paid money for this. Most of the discs I've tried to copy it has hung up and I've had to cancel the operation and throw away another disc. Best I can tell there is NO customer service.When I researched, it seemed to be either Roxio or Nero, and Roxio had better reviews. How Nero could be worse I just can't imagine.Also the program wants me to upgrade. No way."
4,Record Now 9,"In many ways it's easier to use for editing & volume control than the volume 6 that I was using, but it does this automatic fade into songs that I can't quite get around, & I can't stand that. As far as tagging goes, it's great. I don't like the jewell case options at all. I only do mixed cds & I can't get the artist's names to come up on the song lists."
2,Contact lists only decent part of book,"I purchased this book for information on a research project thinking it would provide helpful information. Much to my dismay, the only useful pieces of information is a short ""to-do"" list and a few, mostly unhelpful, contact lists. The commentary in the book is unhelpful and tells you nothing, while leaving you wanting more. Also included is NON-INFORMATIVE information about getting radio airplay seemingly to get you to purchase his book on gaining radio airplay. If it is an uninformed as this book is, I would strongly discourage others from purchasing it."
2,NO RELATIONS,"THE ONLY SONGS ON THIS RECORDS THAT TIGHT IS THE BLOCK IS HOT AND KIESHA, EVERYTHING ELSE IS LIKE A FREESTLE. THIS ALBUM IS WHACK. HOLLA IF YAHERAD ME"
4,Up To Me,"The main reason I got this CD was because I wanted to hear Turk on it, and yea I like Lil wayne's voice and how he raps. So when I listened to it for the first time yea I liked track 2 ""tha block is hot"" then everything was ok after that until the track ""F the world"" rolls around. Lil wayne got deep with the lyrics and I was kinda surprised to hear that from him. A couple good songs in the middle after that and even more surprised with ""Up To Me"" with Turk. All in all it's a good CD. My favorites are 2,8,9,11,12,16,17."
4,Tha Block Is Hot,I think the song sound good. It just that LiL Wayne need more good beat in his song and more people featuring in his song. But i think next song will be good.
4,"this cd is hot,this cd is hot,hot,","tha block is hot.This is the first solo effort by lil wayne.This cd took all that was wrong with 400 degeez and fixed it.It also brought the good parts of 400 degreez.Tha block is hot is an irrestitable title and you need to go pick it up.The beats and lyrics all go together.The cd would have gotten a five had it not had repeatitive lyrics.lil wayne is here to stay,thats all i know.Tha block is hot proves that with great songs like,that block is hot,loud pipes,drop it like its hot,and many others.This is a must have for any ca$h money millionaire.Even people who dislike rap,can find enjoyment in this title.As i said its a must have.So get this must have groundbreaking title."
4,Lil Wayne is the Shhhh,"Yo, I dig the whole Cash Money Click, because they young and making money. They style are so diverse and these Money Makers just keep it real. If you like Juvenile's 400 Degreez and B.G. Chopper City in the Ghetto then you probally need to buy Lil Wayne's The Block Is Hot"
5,RELIGIOUS!,"I saw the face of G-d listening to this album. Lil' Wayne is a young Mark Twain. He is James Joyce and Jean-Paul Sartre rolled into one enlightening package. This is required listening for any youth or teen trying to understand the plight and authenticity of urban life. I quit my job yesterday and told me boss that my new occupation was to be ""a soldier in Professor Lil' Wayne's Army."" He's a brother. He's a role model. He's a saint."
4,The block is hot,"The block is hot was lil waynes first solo album, and he comes through good. You have to apreciate this cd for what it is, some beats are outdated so its hard to judge them in this day of time, and lyrically Wayne gets clever once in a while, but most of the time keeps it simple. So overall I'd say this album is worth listening to, this is probably his 3rd best cd, in order they go Tha carter, Lights out, The block is hot, then 500 Degreez. Some of the best tracks on here are :#2 the block is hot#3 loud pipes#8 F the world#9 Remember me#10 Respect us#11 drop it like its hot#12 young playa#13 enemy turf(best song)#15 Come on#16 up to meif you're thinking about getting this I recommend it for CMR fans, and maybe rap fans in general if you're open minded. 3.5 - 4 stars."
1,li wanye needs to go back to school,yo at times li wanye come off straigfht illiterrate and unable to grip the mic when compared to other southern giants as outkast or goodie mob i can't believe people but the same cash money joints over and over again when people such as cash money don't even care or have the talent to write new lyrics to their music i hear the same lines repeated in almost evey one of their cd these cd's are horrible and lack all the things to nmake a good emcee people where i stay love this stuff but i ain't much feeling all this flash but no lyrics it has nothing for me cause i am not a matrelistic cat i just miss the days when people had skills and didn't try to rhyme every thing with simple words like ha and blindg bling cash money is a fad
3,WAYNE'S FRESHMEN CD IS A DISAPPOINTMENT,"Every since I heard Lil' Wayne rap on Big Tymers CD, I have been waiting for his solo project. Now the wait is over and I'm disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the CD is okay but I expect more from Cash Money. I hope they can redeem their self on December 7 when Juve drops his new album G-Code."
4,THE BLOCK IS ON FIRE!!,"CLASSIC LIL WAYNE WITH MANNIE FRESH BEATS,ALL THE HOTBOYS AND BIG TYMERS!!THIS IS THE WAYNE I GROW UP ON BEFORE HE STARTED WEARING SKINNY JEANS AND VANS!!PLEASE HE USED 2 SPIT WITHOUT EVEN CUSRSING NOW THATS TALENT!"
2,It worked but cable layout a bit weird,"The reader and hub did mostly what I wanted it to do. Would not work on bandwidth hogs such as a scanner or video capture device. Read the cards ok. I didn't like the way it looked as it had the USB cables coming out of the back but the power cable out the side. Kinda sloppy, would have been better if all the cables exited the device on the same side."
5,A Great Way For Teens To Get Closer To God!,This devotional is absolutely wonderful in using circumstances that teens relate to in order to illustrate a concept found in God's word. I encourage all Christian teens to get this book! It is really wonderful in encouraging your faith!
2,Terrible Music,"After listening to Cardio 2 which was very good, Cardio 3 was a real disappointment. It did not sound like original artist music to me. The beat was fast, which was okay, but I tried listening twice, and I couldn't stand it. I like disco, but this was garbage."
5,I love Totoro!,"This is a lovely toy! Totoro is one of my favorite movies, so I have my little Totoro sitting on my desk, and I smile whenever I see him. Very cute!"
4,Great angle to the Civil War,Wonderful way to tie several story lines into each other while revealing true stories from the Civil War. I'd recommend this for anyone interested in the history of this period.
3,PUBLIC DELIGHTER,"This album by tina was the one that put her back on track in the early '80's, and it got her back on the music map for good!This cd boasts a grammy winner and chart topper, WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, the mark knopfler's written titletrack PRIVATE DANCER and the club hit LET'S STAY TOGETHER.There is no mistake, Tina WAS the female rockstar the music world was in need...and she proved that charisma got nothing to do with age.This is a perfect rock production, i reccomend it to anyone in search of raw thrills!"
5,Best book on writing I've ever read,"Being a PR professional, I have read numerous books on writing. On Writing Well is the best one yet! It's got great examples and the author keeps you engaged in every chapter. Anyone interested in writing anything needs this book. It's a gem."
5,An excellent guide to writing.,The book is very informative . I recently moved into a position at my job where writing correspondence is required so i am garnering different styles of writing to enhance my writing skills.This book is highly recommended
3,Needs updating on one point,"I love this book and have taught from it for many years. I understand that the writer is of an earlier generation, but I find it hard to justify presenting my students with a book that uses the universal male pronoun. The writer is always ""he."" The person trying to decipher an insurance policy is ""he."" The reader is ""he.""I get it that the publisher may not want to mess with Zinsser's prose, but this choice really dates the book."
3,Little Einsteins Pat Pat Rocket,My grandson loves Little Einsteins. I had hoped to find a better selection of Little Einsteins toys. He likes his rocket but it really doesn't have very much play value.
5,Forever my favorite!,"I've seen this movie thousands of times and I must say, it gets better every time I watch it. The fact that this was put together by a bunch of college kids is absolutely amazing to me. One of the best movies I've seen. The songs are pure genius! Trey Parker is one of the most intelegent people out in Hollywood today and should get a LOT more credit for his brilliant work than what he does. Matt Stone was hysterically funny in this film as James Humphrey. A must see for any South Park fan."
2,Rated too highly,"This was rated highly because Trey Parker's halo effect. Lower expectations and watch it, and it will be more enjoyable. The first half of the movie has funny parts, but it really drags towards the end."
4,"Awesome, but just a little too rough in form for the 5 stars I was tempted to give","The budget for this was so low I think was actually a negative balance (it was done out of their pockets their sophomore year of college and filmed over spring break!). That being said the brilliance Trey Parker and Matt Stone is unmistakable in this true story of Alfred Packer, a name that lives in infamy in Colorado. This musical is done in the style of ""OKLAHOMA!"", as a story of cannibalism should be told. It starts a little slow, but the musical numbers alone are worth watching the film in its entirety. You can download the soundtrack on iTunes and I highly recommend it. I often catch myself singing ""Sprodionkle Day"", ""Lets Build a Snowman"" and of course my favorite, ""The Trapper Song"". If you pay attention you'll see other worldly visitors to the old west and you'll hear the voice of Cartman years before anyone heard of South Park!"
4,It's a schpedoinkel movie!,"If you are a Trey Parker fan, get this movie immediately! If you are not a fan, give it a go, you may be surprised.The songs alone are worth the price of admission! Therein lies the genius of this musical. The opening song and the ""Trappers' Song"" will haunt you for weeks and months. At least once every other day or so, one of those songs gets stuck in my head, like so many pieces of gristle between the teeth. My wife hits me repeatedly upon hearing a single word or opening note leave my mouth, for she will be ruined for the rest of the day being dogged by such catchy tunes.And who better than the wonderful folks over at Troma to bring this film to us! They consistantly prove their worth and their value in the true independant movie world."
2,Cannibal - B Movie on Steriods,"If you like spoofs, cheap movies, poor effects, and silly humor, you'll like this movie. Low budget, I think by buying a copy of the VHS, I paid 1/2 of the development costs. This makes Attack of the Killer Tomatoes look like a classic of film work. Oh you can enjoy the film and have a good time. I suggest having several beers before watching though. The humor will make more sense. I loved South Park the movie, this ways obviously their first attempt at a movie and they needed the practice. The songs use many of the same music from the Southpark TV show. The Braniff-Beleive It sounds are constantly playing in the music for this movie which was a little confusing. Frankly, it looked like a college film school project."
1,Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,I love South Park and I liked Baseketball but this movie wasn't funny at all. It was total film student torture. If your curiosity is killin' ya rent the thing but please don't buy it.
2,"Student film, but OK for fans of Trey","No-budget fare from lowbrow comedian Trey Parker (famous for co-creating the South Park TV series) taking a stab at the musical-comedy-horror genre in his student film. He plays Alfred Packer, a cannibal who rides a pony named Liane (played by Duster, based on Parker's real-life ex-girlfriend who done him wrong; it's safe to bet she was a real horse's ass). When Liane is stolen by a band of ragtag trappers, Packer goes after them with a vengeance - and a healthy appetite. You really have to be be in the mood for this odd fare.Staci Layne Wilson"
4,Not that good like savage dreams,If you love baby beeshs first album you will be a lil disappointed of that one. It's much slower than savage dreams but still tight. The Intro is my favourite song because it`s too cold for this world!
5,More Johnny Test!,Please make more Johhny Test Season series available. This is one of the best show for family to enjoy. My daughter loves watching it and my wife and myself start watching it and it is so funny!
5,Great Product,Had it up and running in less than 5 minutes. Works great. No problems recieving low signal strength stations. I love it.
2,Only margingal reception improvement,"While this unit did improve my FM reception as compared to the wire, it was only marginally effective and left me a little disappointed but was not a huge investment so I can live with it."
5,walker coat,"i love this coat. it's very versatile, because you can choose to zipper the fleece liner only or the liner and coat for extra warmth. i enjoy wearing it when i go for my walks because the length allows freedom of movement.the lining is like having an attached scarf, when you zip it all the way up.it washed beautifully as well."
5,Magnificent,"Simply put, this collection is one of my prized personal possessions. Buy this book today!"
2,Horrible!!!,"Without any question the worst official Hawkwind album. they trash everything that moves .Huw Lloyd Langton seemed to have only learnt one set guitar chords and one tone..his lack of suitable style and limited dimensions to his playing severly tested my huge love otherwise of Hawkwind for a decade almost. (I like Huw personally but in Hawkwind he was a disaster!)A dreadful heavy trash of Swindells ""Shot Down in the night"" .. a crass ruining of ""Spirit of the Age"" .. ""Lighthouse"" is just pathetic.. ""Brainstorm"" and ""Master of the Universe"" are insipid and listening to this reminds one of the saying of feeling like you are savaged aurally by a dead sheep!Urban Guerilla is crass but listenable. Motorway City is ok.Silver Machine cuts out with an explosion (mercifully!) to save the listener any more pain.Get the idea.. I hate this album LOL!!"
5,Very Shiny,"I bought this ring and was really impressed. It is very shiny, always new looking. If you keep it cleaned with silver jewelry wipes or cloths it stays like brand new. I have had alot of compliments and I wear this ring on a daily basis. From first glance you will think it is real diamonds. If someone is that close to my fingers and says its not -THEY NEED TO MOVE BACK. Guaranteed to impress. I would highly recommend to friends and family."
4,The Looney Tunes are BACK!!,"For anyone who has seen Space Jams, unless your age 16 or under, Looney Tunes: Back In Action is better, funnier, and more true to the spirit of our WB friends.There was, in my opinion, only one really good scene in Space Jams. The scene where Bugs and Daffy go to the real world. Looney Tunes took that great scene and ran with it.I've always said that these were great characters but they needed new material. Space Jams was, for the most part, just a rehash of all their old routines. Well, in Looney Tunes: Back In Action they finally got new bits and their great!I took my daughter to see Looney Tunes: BIA. She was not a fan of Bugs and the gang when we walk into the theater. She WAS when we left. She even went back a week later to see it again.I hope they keep writing new scripts and making new movies. If they do, I'll be there."
2,It's the little things that matter...,"I would have rated this book at least a 4 since the content is really good, however, the spelling and grammar is just awful. As I read this book I kept wondering, ""was the editor on vacation when this book went to print?"". It has more grammatical errors and typos than I have ever seen in a published book, even for a technical book. Literally, I found errors in every single chapter. I would accept this level of quality from a high school student but not from a professionally published book."
2,unhappy loop user,I bought it to use on my new bose radio thinking it would help to bring more stations. but it never changed it at all.
1,am radio loop,"tried on to differnt radio,s, didn,t help at all. one was a boise with built in antenna, the other was apanosonic which l could plug in and that help was so minute it didnt matter"
5,the sheikhs virgin bride,"Very well written and capture my attention. I did not want to put the book down. I could imagin all that was happening,in the passages of this book as i read. Enjoyed reading this kind of book and the aurthor did a great job with the story line."
3,"Good game, but nothing special",I bought this game to replace an older Mah Jong when I upgraded to a new computer.The game works fine on Vista but isn't a whole lot better then the Mahjong Tiles game that comes with Vista.
1,This battery does not fit the V60t phone I have,"This battery does not fit the V60t phone I have. It also does not fit the desktop charger for V60t phone that I bought from Amazon.com either. Basically, this battery is not compatible with the V60t phone that I have and I have to return it since it is of no use to me for this reason."
2,Works fine occasionally,"I've had this heart rate monitor for about 8 months now and if it's not for the fact that I'm cheap, I would've tossed it long time ago. The watch itself looks okay, the band is plastic and cheap looking. The main complaint that I have about this watch is the heart rate monitor reliability. More time than not, my heart rate can't be picked up. I've tried every trick in the book, but still have trouble with it. Everytime I put it on, I have to keep my fingers crossed and hope that it will pick up my heart rate, but most of the time it doesn't. When it does work, very occasionally, the heart rate is pretty accurate.Just save up some more money and buy a Polar to avoid all this hassel."
3,Too late for romance,I bought it to see a girl friend who acted in the movie. Unfortunately she broke it off before delivery.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CABLE!!!,"You will not get what you see or what is described! You will get something that says Philips PH61106 on the package, but it will be a standard, cheap AV cable with the little red/white/yellow connections, it's not even a composite cable at all, it's the standard cheap piece of junk they give you whenever you buy any audio/video component! BUYER BEWARE!"
3,Not Constantine's Style,"I'm not too thrilled with it. It's alright. I like Constantine when he sings songs that require voice ranges and enthusiasm. He did better songs that proved his talent on A.I.Maybe if I saw Betty perform live, it would change my opinion."
1,Pray for the freedom of Constantine,"While I did enjoy Cry and Drift, the rest of the album is just average.Constantine Maroulis is a much better singer than this lack luster album shows. The quality only enforces the belief of some, that the band rushed this project while constantine was on the show. They knew the bus was leaving without them. And Koch was more than willing to cash in with them. (William Hung anyone?)Lets all take a moment, and Pray for the freedom of Constantine. May he find a much needed reprise from this band."
2,"Too Raw, Not enough Real Talent","I ordered this CD to support Constantine; I was really impressed by his voice, his style & his ability to charm a crowd during his stint on American Idol. I was terribly disappointed with this CD, however. There is little evidence of the strong voice & charismatic singing on this CD. It's very grunge; very Nirvana meets Nine Inch Nails, and fails to be original or exciting. I think these pieces must have been recorded a long time ago, before Constantine developed a sense of personal style & identity (at least I hope so.) It's not bad for it's type of music, but is't not amazing, either, and simply does not show case the amazing voice Constantine posesses, or any particular grace or talent of the musicians.I hope Constantive breaks out, soon, and makes his own CD, or that the band really finds Betty's soul, if they keep working together. I found this CD to be soulless..."
1,Constantine needs Queen!,"The music is totally devoid of creativity or originality and the musicians really suck bad...Constantine Maroulis has shown the world over that he has greatness thrust upon him and one of the most beautiful voices I have heard in recent years, but it is being litteraly thrashed by this work. Constantine deserves way better musicians and quality music to exploit the full range of his rare talent. Hence...the title of this review! And by the way, Constantine could really kick butt with a band like Queen and give it a serious shot of rejuvenation! Sorry, just being honest here:-)"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,You've probably heard better singing at your local bar....late at night when everyone's had a little too much to drink.Save your money.
2,Pray for Con to leave Betty,"I really wanted to like this album. I kept playing it over and over, hoping to be drawn in, and except for a moment here and there on the album, I'm just not.This is not the Constantine Maroulis of American Idol fame. That Constantine sings with a beautiful, open, sonorous voice full of joy for life and for performing. This voice of his is all angst, and very affected, like he's singing the way he thinks a rock star should sing instead of singing the way HIS voice and personality shines.If you are STILL into grunge, or angry, you may like this album. If you want to hear Constantine shine, pray for Constantine to leave Betty behind."
1,just bad,"CONSTANTINE MAROULIS may be easy on the eyes, but thei s cd is awful. A bit to hardcore for a debut albumn. Maybe payback for not getting further in AI, I really think he can sing and does have talent, when he did David Cassidy's I THINK I LOVE YOU, it was a good take on a old 70's song. Then when he did Queens Bohmeian Rhaposdy it sent shivers down my bones, (no Freddy) but not bad. Sorry this is just a disappointment, better luck next cd. This may have been a let down to his fans, not to mention that AI has a large pre teen audience not to mention how many parents would go out and buy this cd, for it surely would have a explicit warning label on it."
1,Con bites..so does Betty,"Is this really Constantine? I expected soooo much more from him than this piece of crap. Nothing that a little frisbee with a CD against the wall can't cure.. Do it, you'll feel better."
1,Greek Tragedy,"I bought this CD because I was a huge fan of Constantine Maroulis when he was on American Idol and I was very disappointed with it. The music is dated, derivative, watered down grunge with vapid, embarassing lyrics.The people calling this the best CD they have ever owned are simply members of the band's street team on orders from Betty bassist Craig to spam this site with faux positivity. This is a two-star Alice in Chains rip-off at best, a money-grubbing cash-in on Constantine's newfound fame at worst.Constantine escaped the obscurity he was destined for as Betty front man with his run on American Idol, but if he doesn't leave this garage band he will be forgotten after all. Don't encourage him to stay, Constantine fans. Save your money and support his solo efforts instead."
1,"OK, but nothing original","Finally had the chance to listen to the whole CD, and the truth is it's OK, nothing new or original. Don't waste the money on it, wait until Con has the chance to do something on his own with proper songwriters and producers, and musicians.If you go backwards and read the five star comments, 90% of them are coming from the regulars that frequent the Betty Boards, and so they are giving a biased opinion...and yes, most of them are 30 plus women lusting over a bunch of mediocre looking guys (except for CON), hoping to get lucky...kind of embarassing actually!I hope you do better with your next production CON, because we know that you can do it!"
4,"Historical, full of suspense, humor! and romance","A good read. This is my third Susan Wiggs book. Pippa, Aidan, Iago and Donal Og, what a delightful bunch they were in the telling of their adventures through England to Ireland and beyond. It was so easy to visualize their experiences. This book made me both laugh and cry. Because of the storm of emotions among the key players in Aidan and Pippa's final fate, I expected a different ending. I was surprised. One suggestion. A glossary of the Gaelic terms would have been nice."
5,This compilation is SMOKING!,"This bomba compilation is the real thing... fast-paced, extremely rich in the drum section, quite solid in the chorus response. Should anyone need a primer on Afro-Puerto Rican music, this may be the place to start. Another alternative would be any production by another Loiza native, William Cepeda (who played trombone with Dizzy Gillespie, among others), or Raices, a CD/DVD documentary produced by Puerto Rico's Banco Popular"
1,Not worth buying,"I'm glad I hadn't bought this cd, but had just checked it out at the library! The cd says ""Compliments of Huggies"" on it and it is basically a sampler cd. It only seemed to last about 15 minutes, and so each of the 10 tracks was quite short. It was disappointing and is not worth buying in my opinion. If you want a baby einstein cd, pick a different one!"
3,Dream-like,Beattie writes beautifully. But I found this story flowed kind of like a dream that you can vaguely remember when you wake up. I felt that the story didn't really go anywhere.
4,Scholarly Review,"... The author/editor has compiled a very scholarly work on the Hopi and the place of the kachina in their life and spirituality. Each contributor has done extensive research in his/her field of expertise. If there is a negative side to the book, I would say it is TOO SCHOLARLY for the average reader. It is not a book which one should consider for pure enjoyment and 'light' reading. It reads much more like a graduate text book ... for which many of these articles were intended. If you are looking for indepth material, this is the book for you. If you like to relax and curl up with an 'enjoyable read' ... you won't find it here."
5,Excellent overview of modern kachina scholarship,"Polly Schaafsma, an expert on Ancestral Puebloan rock art, edits 16 chapters that look at various aspects of the kachinas of the Puebloan world.This includes:1. Just what are kachinas?2. Whence did the kachina phenomenon come from/arise?3. What led to it landing on fertile soil in the late Ancestral Puebloan world?4. What was the relation in kachina development between western pueblos and Rio Grande pueblos?5. How did kachina worship/cult survive the Spanish missionary effort to wipe it out? Related to that, how much survived, and can we trace what changes happened?The intellectual level on some pieces may be fairly high, but I have to disagree with another person; you do not need to be an anthropology or archaeology grad student to get a welter of information out of this book.One should have a basic knowledge of Ancestral Puebloan history, but any reaonably informed ""Southwest buff"" probably is OK as a starting point."
5,Fanciful country fun,"Paul Brett Johnson's imaginative adventures with Miss Rosemary and her farm-full of precocious animals just keep getting better with The Pig Who Ran a Red Light. Playful watercolor illustrations and country-toned jargon add up to adorable fun for all ages, and especially ""those who have sometimes wished to be somebody else."" I think I got as much of a kick out of this delightful book as my nearly-three-year-old himself, and we liked it even more than its fun-filled predecessor, The Cow Who Wouldn't Come Down."
5,The First Nite is all that...,"I don't know whether I first heard this on the radio or saw it on the video, but either way I loved it immediately. Along with some other tunes, this is one of my ""on the way to work, pick me up"" songs. If you're in the Edison, NJ area and you here this song blasting out of a car, it will probably be me. Honk if you love ""The First Night""."
3,America's Favorite Millionaire Lunatic Toots His Own Horn...,"This is one of the funniest books I've read in a long, long time; unfortunately for Pat Robertson, the comedy is all unintentional. The man who once claimed that feminism is ""a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft and become lesbians"" now tries to paint himself as every women's best pal; the man who claimed, in ""The New World Order"" that Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter and George Bush were doing the secret bidding of a hideous ""cabal whose goal is nothing less than a new order for the human race under the domination of Lucifer and his followers"" tries once again to be psychotic and credible simultaneously. (...)"
1,Remember that Pat wrote this,"Pat Robertson's photo should be placed next to the word egotistical in the dictionary. This autobiography is very well-written, as it should be by a Yale lawyer, but the work conveniently fails to mention some of Pat's life story, including his fathering an illegitimate child, his barefaced lying about his war record, and his father being a Freemason. Pat Robertson is a very intelligent, dangerous man."
2,mom1sue,"It seems as if there is more static now that I am using the anti-static dryer balls, but in all honestly it could be just the change in weather. I do not see much difference one way or the other really."
1,Don't work!,I'm so disappointed that even on the first wash without fabric softener these did not work at all for static! My load of laundry had as much static as when I do not use fabric softener!
3,Watched! out for SIMITAR...,"The copy of WATCHED that I got here recently is NOT the inferior SIMITAR brand SLP speed tape, but a VESTRON label SP edition. It's a shame that more of this ""last gasp of the counterculture"" film aren't available from Vestron, a superior company.WATCHED! (1974) is no work of art and SIMITAR, the manufacturer listed here, was no class label. If their product wasn't overmodulating, then the EP speed wreaked havoc with even the best-maintained VCRs.I bought a few of their tapes many years ago from a dollar store. One in particular was a documentary of the recently-ended Gulf War. Wow, was that thing LOUD! (oy) And talk about boring!So forewarned is forearmed, right? Not necessarily. WATCHED! is NEVER gonna be shown on TV as it's way-too coke-heavy, and NObody uses that stuff, right? Not even back in the day. Uh-uh, not us.Whether or not you've got a 3-dollah bill to burn on SIMITAR's product in order to watch WATCHED is a hard choice, fer sure!"
2,Jazzman jarvis wants jazz!!!!!,"I will be short and sweet. Push the rap and get back to more Starfish and the Moon. In his sleeve notes he States, be true to your focus and believe in what you do. I say, give the customers what they want A good jazz saxaphonist."
4,Good product,"What a product should be, not high performance but quality like oem works great and the product came on time and good packaging"
5,Beautiful thoughts for beautiful houses,"Your home will never be profiled in Town & Country. Your house isn't grand enough, which you couldn't afford and wouldn't want anyway. Turning away from the architectural glossies and their emphasis on intriguing design, Susan Susanka instead examines what makes a house a home--what arrangements of space lead to the comfort and familiarity that we all treasure.The book is not a cheap do-it-yourself manual. ""Not enormous"" does not mean ""thrifty."" If, however, you are interested in building your own home, you cannot afford to ignore this book."
5,Wonderfully written and great info!,"This book is wonderful for someone who is looking to learn a few essential tricks to creating a ""home the rises up to great you"". It uses home examples to illustrate the fundamental concepts to creating a aesthetically pleasing home. If you are designing a home, an interior designer/architect, or someone who loves to read about the built world, this book is a great read. It can really help you understand why one home ""works"" and another is always up for sale!"
1,Think before you buy!,"This for me was a lesson in how not to take any notice of what the reviewers say. The first thing that struck me was the awful, heavy, plodding sound - did he record it in the bathroom? Then I wondered how he could drag each syllable out so painfully and oh god, it's like that on every track. It never lets up. I really wanted to like this album but after skipping through all the tracks in about 2 minutes I can't bear the thought of ever hearing it again. And he sounds like such a cool guy..."
1,Horrible,"I think that his music is dreadful. I unfortunately went to a concert of his in Ridgefield CT and he turned out to be the worst musician i have ever heard, and he practically used Ridgefield as a practice session. His singing was horrible, his guitar playing was horrible (hey!...have you ever heard of a pick?) and just the whole concert was terrible. Rufus....no wait...i mean Dufus Wainwright is an all-around horrible musician."
1,Ugh! Such schlock.,"I'm really stunned that this is rated so highly. I absolutely hated it and kept coming back to it over and over trying to bridge the gap between my experience and his media darling reviews. I couldn't. Months later I still absolutely despised this indulgent crappy, schlocky cd. I loaned it to a friend who loved it.""It's yours!"" I said.I'm glad it found a good home because it was destined for the garbage can. There is no relief on in the songs from the impossibly pointless, wimpy depths rufus attempts to fill with his caterwauling version of soul.I never thought I'd be able to tolerate another simpering Rufus Wainright moment, but later I heard the song ""Vibrate"" which I think is really quite nice."
5,dreamy and eloquent,"The more I listen to it, the more I am captivated by the melody, the imagery. It is one of my favorite 'driving' cds because I can really be swept up by the experience, listen to the lyrics and enjoy the orchestration"
5,Absolutely Incredible!,"I picked up this CD at a used music store after hearing some of RW's music in a coffee shop. I was blown away by it! Incredible depth of lyrics, lush layers of music. RW is truly a unique, extremely talented songwriter. I just ordered his ""Poses"" album...can't wait!"
4,Everyone needs a Totoro!,"If you are unfamiliar with the Miyazaki film, My Neighbor Totoro, then you will not understand how wonderful having your own Totoro is! My family loves this movie and any and all toys associated with the film!"
3,A so-so effort,"Better to buy Briefcase Full Of Blues rather than this effort. If you'd like to beef up your collection of Blues Brothers songs, that's fine. It's just not a 'best effort' CD."
1,Sabat the ignorant A-Hole,Want to read a book about a dufus who likes to bully people with his meager martial art skills and lack of any buddhist enlightenment? Read this. It won't teach you self-defense or offense but it is a guide to getting yourself killed or killing someone by accident because you lack any foundation. Also the title is very unoriginal and Sabat seems half-illiterate.
4,"Good Unit, but a more powerful one is available","This is a very good unit. However after purchasing it, I realized that there is one that is almost identical but more powerful. This one can't handle my receiver, dvd player and plasma all at once if there is a loud audio influx- it shuts down as an overload. For some reason it occasionally makes a whirring noise and beeps, even though there was no power failure at the time. All in all I would recommend this unit, but would encourage other buyers to get the more powerful unit."
2,Hypnosis Tapes,"I have used hypnosis tapes before, I ordered this one to change it up. British product, British accent, I just didn't care for it as much as some others I still use."
5,For any Full House Fan!!!,Has a ton of Full House pictures. For anyone who loves Full House this is for you.
3,MY WILD IRISH CHINA.,"The Chairman is a cold war drama and thriller,Gregory Peck plays a scientist who receives a letter from and old friend in China about an enzyne that might help a starving world,but he would have to go to China to bring it out.The military puts a tracker in his head to track his movements,but he doesn""t know that a explosive device is built into it.Greg goes to China and gets to meet the Chairman,and it goes from there,The movie was filmed in Ireland but who would know that but the people in it,overall not great film but it keeps you involved and some nice action stuff and explosions to wake you up at the end."
2,"Interesting, yet ultimately flawed","Like Fantasia, this movie features many short animated clips, but set to ""modern"" music -- if you consider the 40's to be modern. A number of interesting clips - the wintertime one, the bumblebee one and johnny appleseed stand out. There are unfortunately an equal number of segments that seem to drag or are incredibly dated: the trees and the samba segments come to mind.However, the worst thing about this particular DVD is that the Pecos Bill segment has been obviously edited from the original to remove a cigarette from Pecos Bill. This seems the height of hypocrisy - plenty of new Disney films have no such resistance to cigarettes appearing onscreen. This version of the film stands as a bad example of spineless political correctness for no reason that benefits the end product."
5,Disney Gold Classic,I bought the DVD because it included the ballad of Pecos Bill. This was done with Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers back in the late 40s. The story is animated and narrated by Roy and the band with song and clever lyric. It is a great story and the music is pure western lore. It is interesting that it has been edited to make it politically correct meaning that Pecos Bill doesn't roll and smoke his cigarettes as he did in the original version. It is certainly a classic and enjoyable to have in DVD quality sound and picture. JBW
1,A child's book...,This book had little to no useful information about actually working on or modifying a jeep. It reads like Chryslers propaganda glorifying the Grand Cherokee with out any facts to back it up. This book is trivial at best and grossly miss titled. In short I feel dumb for even buying this book and advise anyone with serious questions about the vehicle to look elsewhere. But then again maybe I'm being a little harsh; it might be an all right coffee table book or a piece of bathroom literature.
3,"AN INSPIRING STORY, BUT FLAWED STORY TELLING!","I can understand why a lot of people loved this film as it is hard to deny it's inspiring story. My biggest problem with this film is that is never seems to go deeper than the surface on the subject. There are a few scenes where I thought we were going to get a much deeper dialogue, but instead we are treated to a little music montage to mask over any script deficiencies. This gives the film a TV movie quality at times.The actors are all in the moment and who can't feel sorry for anyone who has to deal with such a catastrophic disease. When the film started I didn't even think I wanted to continue to watch it as it just seemed too depressing, but when the story unfolds into the parents search for a cure it draws our focus to that task. Is this film manipulative? absolutely, but it is a very touching story with a very likable cast."
3,Basic Information,I may have rated to harshly as I don't have a problem with living without electricity. Some folks I have talked with think it is impossible or just to weird. They won't be convinced of anything in the book. Those who want to know why the Amish live without electricity may find a few answers to their questions-as well has how they do it. I would have liked more photos of equipment the Amish do use and explanation of how they modify motors and machines to work without being on the grid.
5,An excellent Read & Translation,"I unlocked my iPhone when I was traveling in Europe from www.frimobil.se/iphone and they immediately linked me an epub copy of this book. Taking the Euro-rail from Northern Europe southward was accentuated all the more with this tittle. If you have some time on a plane, train, or beach...get it!"
4,A fascinating book,"This book developed a fascination within me for the history of this time period. With this book you will feel as though you are riding with Napolean's army on one page and the next you will be a Russian watching your capital be sacked. Tolstoy's beautifully woven tale is a master piece. The book is intimidating due to its size, but it is well worth the time and effort."
5,A thrill in every episode,"I look forward to finding out how our reluctant hero will overcome the next challange. Good writing, good acting, and great special effects. The primise of the movie is fantastaic. I won't miss an episode."
5,A scorcher!,"This was an absolutely perfect way for Nick to come clean with Hank, and to develop the amnesia plot-line without getting too ""tragic""."
5,Excellent Series,I love this show! My friend just got me hooked on it and I cannot get enough! I had to buy season 1 to know everything I had missed. Looking forward to the second half of season 2.
4,A Wise Purchase,"As a new owner of a quality table saw and following the suggestions of a woodshop instructor friend, I purchased this ""manual"" to better understand the proper and safe use of a powerful table saw.Most of my woodworking education has been, ""self-taught"" and as I age I appreciate the benefits of following safe practises and still having ten fingers."
4,Great Comparative Book,"This book gives an excellent insight into the various forms of Filipino Fighting Arts. It examines 27 different styles, giving a brief description of the history of the style, training progressions, training methods, fighting strategies and free sparring. The only downfall of the book is that due to the wide range of styles discussed, it does not go into depth on any of the styles. However, once you obtain this background, you can then select books that are more in depth on a particular style. I enjoyed see the stylistic difference and learned some of the background of each style."
2,disappointed,was very heartbroken with this product to small not a well made at all wish i would have sent it back
1,A novel that takes a bold step...,"Of not including a single likable character! Rado, Thorn, their mysterious backers, the Fact, the Fact's worshippers...there is no one to root for. In some books the 'heroes' are useless and we're reduced to pulling for the villains; here we don't even have that luxury."
1,HOW ARROGANT AND IGNORANT CAN YOU GET?,"The enigma machine was discovered by the BRITISH - not American's. Robin Hood was British, not an American, so on and so on. Why does Hollywood feel it needs to take British Hitory and fables, and twist it round or make it ridiculously inacurate so that gullible people think it's therefore part of American history? Come on people, I know America is a new country, but make your own history instead of trying to steal ours, we wouldnt try to say president Linoln was actually British, sheesh!"
2,Pale shadow of Das Boot,"The HD DVD is a very fine transfer, and the audio is great. That said, this movie follows in the fine tradition of Hollywood doing a lame imitation of a great foreign film.Where Das Boot strove for claustrophobia, along with a sense of humanity, U-571 delivers a story full of explosions but devoid of accuracy or emotion. In the end, you don't really care who lives or dies.That kind of says it all, except that if you're interested in naval realism, don't expect if from torpedo shots that make miraculous hits, and depth charges that pop every second for, oh, it seems like minutes. And the back of the German ""destroyer"" seemed to look a lot like the low rounded back of a tugboat, which was odd as the destroyer in the combat sequence looked credible."
3,A Solid World War 2 Naval Movie,"It's not very often we see a World War Two Naval movie. Being a fan of this genre of movie it was with a degree of nervousness that I watched U571, hoping that the Director could pull it off. I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. It isn't a classic but it is an enjoyable and entertaining movie that is a little different to most of the war dramas we see these days. The story line is interesting if not pretty basic. Capture a deciphering machine for decoding messages that can alter the direction of the war. The sets used to depict the submarine are believable. There is plenty of action to keep the adrenaline pumping and the tension is steady throughout the movie. The acting is sound if not overly spectacular and there are no real twists in the movie. World War Two enthusiasts and those who enjoy a slice of action should enjoy the movie. Recommended."
1,A fill that distorts completly history,"This one of those films that distorts completly history. A US crew gets an Enigma machine and break the German World War II codes. This is false, the British with some help from the Poles broke the Enigma and the German codes. Hollywood must not produce this type of movies that have nothing to do with reality and are clearly a lie."
4,Very entertaining!,"After reading some of the reviews, I have to tell my opinion on this movie.I watched Das Boot after I saw this movie because of all of the people saying it was not that good, you should see Das Boot, It's more realistic and historically correct. Well, Das Boot was more realistic, which made it boring at some points. Historically correct, yes, but who cares. If I wanted to watch something about history I would watch Das Boot or the history channel, and U-571 never claimed to based on a true story. Das Boot did have its moments, but far fewer then the boring parts.U-571 was all action, non stop. Very entertaining to watch, I even watched it three more times within one week. The fx are spectacular, and it always kept you wondering how they would get out of their situation. I recommend this to be part of anyone's DVD or VHS collection."
2,Watch Das Boot instead,"I just finished watching Das Boot. To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous. Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot."
1,"I'm very, very angry.","It is typically American to sacrifice historical truth on the altar of financial gain, and that is exactly what this film does. Ignoring the fact that the single action that saved an estimated one million lives in WWII was perpetrated by the British Navy, it is of course the US navy that has to save the day. It is not enough that the DVD states the historical truth after the film has finished. This is hugely disrespectful to servicemen, and an embarassing display of crass ignorance. Once again, Hollywood has presented a bastardised version of history."
3,An excelent movie but americans are too full of themselves,"I love this movie and on DVD it's great. The effects are amaing and it's true claustrophobic terror. Not quite as good as Das Boot (German for ""The Boat"") but comes close. Harvey Kietel was great along with Matthew McConoaughey. Can't say the same for Bon Jovi though. This would have been four star movie if they would have thrown in other people from different countries on this sub. But no it was all americans on board, typical, just like in saving private ryan all americans. The writers are obviously american. British war movies have people from different nationalities why can't these american films. Because americans think they won the war by themselves. This is the only downfall to the movie and maybe a flaw here or there but other wise get it."
4,Good WWII flick.,"Great movie. Well thought out plot. A lot of people complain about the fact that the movie portrays a US submarine crew capturing the enigma when it was actually the British that first captured it. A lot of people have put this movie down as a result. Let me point out something. The movie was fictional and dedicated to the memory of those that fought in submarines during WWII. Also, at the end of the movie the makers of the movie DO GIVE CREDIT to the British. If you read the sequence at the end of the movie it lists two HMS submarines as having first captured the enigma. HMS - HER MAJESTY's SERVICE. That's Britain, guys."
4,ACTION - ADVENTURE - GREAT SOUND,"I found this movie to be very entertaining and an enjoyable ride. the sound effects in this movie were TOP NOTCH. perhaps, there were inaccuaracies in this movie but, this is to be entertainment NOT a documentary. i really enjoyed the story, the acting, and the movie for it's sound. if you want a movie that makes your state of the art surround system go BANG then this is the one to buy! enjoy it!"
4,Great Stuff,"A very entertaining movie that is only made better seeing on DVD. The sound quality enhances the scenes with the depth charges so much it is unbelievable. Great cast, well written and a gutsy movie. Also love the short hair on Bon Jovi, you could barely recognize him. Much like the Matrix and Gladiator, this is a must for anyone how loves thier DVD player and loves movies. The extra stuff is also a great bonus."
2,Hollywood Honker,"The extremely heavy-handed hollywood style made parts unwatchable - the worst being the German destroyer ( I don't think the Germans had destroyers ) dropping 2 depth charges every 20 seconds as they cruised along, but the people in the sub were having to endure 10 of them blowing up in a 10 second period, and all of them too close to survive. If you want a sub flic, see Das Boot."
1,oh dear,"An absolutely awful awful film.Take an event in history, and corrupt it so almost nothing of the truth remains.As a nation are we really so insecure we have to steal the history of other countries to bolster our own national pride and identity?!In short, this film takes an event of amazing heroism done by the BRITISH during World War 2, and makes out it was done by AMERICANS. Frankly I'm embarassed my nation feels it's necessary to go down this low.What next?! How the USA won the Battle of Britain?! How America beat Napolean?! How we were responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire?!Anyone with the slightest sense of nation or even the remotest knowledge of history will feel the same."
1,"Ignorance is bliss, huh.","David Scott Roberts review (See above) inadvertently proves the point of those criticising this film's bastradisation of history. Alan Turing, the inventor of the computer, was not based at Princeton University, USA, but at Kings College Cambridge, UK. Now what were you saying about films like this not affecting the lamentably ignorant US publics' views of history??"
2,Do yourself a favor and go read a good book instead.,"This really isn't a very good movie. It's a barely passablemovie. It's made up as a period piece, but it is not verycredible in that respect. A simple-minded enough wayto kill a couple hours, I guess, but this is clearly justanother effort to make money off of the WWII jones thatmost people have and cannot refuse. The acting is veryminimal, and in fact there is wasted talent all over --Harvey Keitel in particular. The explosions are ... ok,I guess, but the sense of triumph in this one is mutedby the fact that I can turn on the History Channel any dayof the week and watch something more compelling.Das Boot, the German movie, is frankly a bit better thanthis, and I didn't even like Das Boot very much!"
1,Pathetic,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Matthew McConaughey can act, but with this poor excuse for a movie he is given no room to shine. Also, I disliked Harvey Keitel in 1999's Holy Smoke and after seeing this I dislike him even more. Do yourself a favor and pass this movie up the next time you want to rent a movie"
5,Great Movie,"This is one of the great submarine movies of all time. Best depiction of a depth charge attack ever. Solid acting, script and execution."
1,Why do we accept this American propaganda?,"Right, so this film isn't actually based on the real life event, so therefore we British shouldn't feel offended by the disgraceful revisionist ideas of this film?This doesn't stop you Yankees waving your stars and stripes every time an American hero (no matter if they're fictional or not) kills a nasty Russian, Vietnamese or German does it?This film may be made up, but a very similar event did take place, so you can understand why we British feel offended at whats being implied.If you can't tell I really did not like this film."
2,"Good story, poor editing","I liked the storyline for this DVD, but did not like the editing. I saw the original movie when it was released, and this is not the original. Some of the characters have been changed, and the editing is poor. For the original DVD I would give 5 stars, but for this (the non-region 2 DVD) edited version I would give 1 star but I like the story so I give it 2 stars."
1,Deceitful plotline and full of submarine movie cliches.,"I was very disappointed in this film. The enigma codes were in reality recovered by the British sailors in surface ships and I am not aware of any heroic American mission to recover them. For a start the construction of American heroes on this theme seemed wrong. Then the plot began to drag as all the old submarine war movie cliches were rerun - the tension between CO and XO, the destroyer-submarine combat, the depth charges, the leaking pipes and the frightened faces of cocooned men hundreds of feet below the surface. The representation of the technology also wrankled me. The rate at which charges are dropped by destroyers would make the close succession of explosions near the sub impossible. Moreover, the closeness of those explosions at 200m depth would definitely have imploded the hull. Generally, a load of garbage."
1,Sure won't raise any eyebrows.,"You don't see too many submarine-movies anymore these days. I think that's a shame. I also think it's a shame u-571 isn't anything remarkable. It's watching sweaty faces looking up as they hear their own sub collapsing under the pressure for two hours. It's not really about the crew or the enemy, it's just about the submarine. And then there are some nice action sequences and some passable 'thrills' and a forgettable climax with a bunch of bangs and that's it."
1,How low can Hollywood go?,"This film should be the last war film you ever watch. What a waste of time! If I had paid to see this I would have demanded my money back! Many other reviewers have picked holes in the film itself and the many technical mistakes so it is pointless repeating it here.The real story of ""U-571"" is far more exciting and captivating than the fiction within this film. At least the film refers to the real heroes at the start of the credits, but I guess Hollywood doesn't like the idea of foreigners being heroes!In short, just don't watch it."
3,Fun for fans of historical fiction,"Interesting war drama full of great visual effects, but cardboard performances and cliched ""Saturday matinee"" script. At 1 hour, 57 minuts, this might be overlong for the casual action moviegoer.The special/bonus features could have been better, in my opinion, and basically only serve to showcase the already ubiquitous presence of multi-credited Jonathan Mostow. An actor's commentary, more submarine/war achival footage and actual historical detail would have been more greatly appreciated. Still, this was purchased in a supermarket at the bargain price of $9.99, so it actually contained a lot more material than I expected.Strictly for genre fans."
1,Hmmm.....,"I was wondering why I was the only person in the cinema when I saw this movie. By the end of the 2 hours, I realized why no-one else had come to see it. It is simply because it is dumb. Flat-out dumb. The script is weak and needed improving, the acting is terrible and disappointing because it had such a good cast, and the director...well, lets not go there. On the other hand, U-571 had awesome sound, great special effects and good editing, but I suppose those aren't really the important things, are they? I do not recommend this movie at all."
1,Pure Nonsense,"Definitely the worst war movie since ""Saving private ryan"". Once again the Germans are one dimensional ""Bad guys"" and the Americans are unrealistic and cliched. Cannot even begin to compare with ""Das Boot"" which is in a class all its own. Not surprising really considering Mostow sincerely believes that all Germans were rabid Nazis."
3,"Good movie, But Fake and Absurd.","U-571 is a good movie. But the story is untrue and not authentic. Like one revieweer said, depth charges can't be released that fast and shooting thompsons, 45s, and everything else in a U boat is STUPID. I think that it should have been about the British capturing the Enigma and not some fairytale about some American submarine sailors shooting up and then sailing in a U boat."
5,"Great exercise pants, especially for slightly overweight girls","I'm about 10 pounds overweight, but these flared stretchy legging are very flattering and forgiving to my figure. Also have a pair in black. They run a little big -- not so big that you should order a size up, but big enough that you might decide to throw them in the dryer."
1,WRONG PRODUCT,"Buyer Beware! Amazon fulfills this order but the inventory comes from another company. The inventory must be mixed up because we received a *maternity* support belt, not a *postpartum* support wrap."
3,Does its job,"I recently purchased this item after having my first child. I'm 21 and was very worried about my getting my shape back, after using the product for the last 2 weeks I have seen a noticeable change in my stomach and waist size. the only complaint I have is that under certain shirts you are able to see it. Other than ""that it does its job."
4,Works Well But...,"I purchased this after I had my baby. My tummy shrank quite a bit after wearing it for two weeks. But like the previous reviewers said, it does have a bad tendency to roll up on you if you sit down or bend over, and the seam were the velcro is happens to be very visible under clothing. So I don't recommend taking it to yoga class. I am hoping that by the time I have my next child they will come out with something that is less visible under clothing and doesn't roll up. But the bottom line is that it does work, and I would use it again for the next baby."
2,Not Exactly What I Ordered... :(,"I've been collecting Disney's 50 animated feature films on DVD for the past 12 YEARS...The last one I needed to complete my collection was Saludos Amigos.I ordered this DVD that was listed as the ""Saludos Amigos Gold Classic Collection"" DVD, which would have just contained the movie, Saludos Amigos, on it's own. Instead I received the ""Classic Caballeros Collection DVD with Saludos Amigos AND The Three Caballeros"". This is NOT what I ordered at all. I already own The Three Caballeros. Why would I need two copies of this movie? Very upset, very disappointed. I just want what I ordered...Be wary of emerald_city_collectibles--their listing was false and I did not get exactly what I wanted."
3,Way too short for the price,"The packaging says 75 minutes, the film is 45. For such a short movie, it sure is expensive. Maybe its 75 minutes with all the previews they put before the movie even begins. This is for diehard Disney fans."
4,Disney gem!,"This is great and one of the classic Disney hits I'm pleased, as a collector, to see come out on DVD! There's no escape from having to say that the 'film' is odd, but it's a great entertainer which you can watch over and over again without ANYONE moaning! The animation is great and the extras you get make it well worth its price. Kids and adults will have great fun. A must-have DVD!"
5,The best RPG ever made for PC,"This is the best RPG that has ever hit the PC! Final Fantasy 8 has the best story line with outstanding graphics. This is a must have game for PC, even if you are not a RPG lover. This game has the coolest characters that fit in the story line perfectly. If you like magic, weapons, powerful attacks, and realistic CG cinemas. This is a game I highly recommend to any one."
5,Dont be afraid to buy it.,"After reading some of the rewiews below, i was a little afraid of buying the game,afraid to waste my money, afraid to play the game for ten minutes and then throw it to the trash. Finally i buy it, and i have to say that the game is absolutly awesome. The story is complex and keep you reading and reading the dialogs just to know more. The grafics, especialy the cutscenes are incredible (except maybe for the backgrounds, but they are not terrible). The junction system its not a pain in the head, the manual and the tutorial in the game teach you very well how to use it. My advice is that you dont be afraid to buy this game, i told you, you wont be dissapointed."
1,Gratuitous.,Poorly written. Not worth my time. Loved Duchovy in X-Files. I was disappointed with this show. Too bad for me.
2,Nothing wrong with it,"The show is great, VERY raunchy so not for the faint of heart or youngesters. I didn't have any problems with the DVD."
5,Brilliant show,"Wow, i remember watching a few episodes of this show when it was well into its first season during showtime's free preview weekend and i said to myself ""this is the most awesome show i've ever seen"". Californication also marked senor duchovny's return to the small screen and in my opinion, this is his best work since his days on the x files. plus, the season one dvd set is almost worn out since i've been watching it so much."
5,"Feisty, sexy and hilariously funny...","Maybe it's due to the fact that I was born and raised in Europe, that I find this show not at all shocking. Duchovny's character is quite common over here and it's best to take them with a good laugh. Underneath all this broken up, f.cked up image he depicts, there is a little lost boy. But, as in life, not everybody can be saved. I think this show is very funny, finally an intelligent adult series. I hate all these cleaned up versions of happy-go-lucky soap operas, where nobody ever uses a bad word, nor takes a serious gulp of whiskey or even has some steamy sex. Well this is more like it. Life isn't at all like Gilmore-Girls and why not tell about it? I hope the show will carry on for some time, I'd love to see all the characters develop. And as I am on the subject, I am not all too sure about that sex-addiction thing of Mr. Duchovny. Maybe it is just a publicity stunt. Well, I don't care, as long as he keeps on doing this fine work."
2,"Pales in comparison to other ""behaving badly"" shows, unoriginal, unfunny","Very good acting, the rest of this is a mess of cliches and platitudes for aging hipster wannabes. Nothing original to see here. Compare to much better shows of the genre such as Weeds and Entourage, to see just how lacking this is. Actually fell asleep on the couch during some of the sex scenes.Only wrote this as got gypped buying the boxed set based on all the shill or misguided reviews here and wanted to add some objectivity. The amazon ratings are way off on this one."
2,Too many errors,"I bought this book for my last M&A class, and as I am going through the book now, I find it to be riddled with computational errors. Why is that so? Shouldn't there be editors to check for these sorts of simple mistakes? Within the first few chapters, some of the problems and examples given in the chapter have data that don't match up and can cause confusion for those who are using it. Other than that, this book seems like a good backup reference, but all the math errors really make this book seem very unprofessional."
1,Much ado about nothing,"This is a very superficial book. If you've had an introductory course in finance (Brealey and Myers or Ross, Westerfield and Jaffe) it is unlikely that you will learn anything new or profund."
4,Great Resource!,This book is great for family discussions. It's perfect for teens and tweens. I will definitely recommend this book to my friends.
5,Freddy's Back,"Suffer The Children is a nice start to a brand new Freddy storyline so to speak. The characters, with their abilities, resemble the teenagers in Nightmare 3 - Dream Warriors.This is a very interesting book, along with Protege, keeps you wanting to read more to see what happens next. The characters are well-developed, Freddy is a sicko like usual. All around it's a great book."
5,Editors Choice in NY Times Book Review,"The blurb I read there looked interesting, which is why I came here to look for more info. They term it ""an intellectual autobiography"" (Sunday, Feb 13, 2005, page 20.)A life unexamined was said not to be worth living. Perhaps this is a contemporary account in that vein? The sole review here seemed insufficient as a guide to the book's merits or demerits. I've ordered the book, and will review later...on the assumption that the topic looks promising enough to fork over some cash for some answers to, well, living a good life, right? Can't get enough of that these days..."
2,"O Europe, o India!","Pankaj Mishra is one of those intellectual Indians Alain Dani√©lou once described as anglicized and completly out of touch with India's ancient cultures. The book reflects this. Mr. Mishra seems to draw his knowledge on buddhism more or less from European sources. He obviously is not conversant with Sanskrit. Yoga and magic, core elements of hinduism as well as buddhism, are unfamiliar to him. As a result he does not come to the point which makes the book quite tiresome."
2,Berndt Weikl is a bore,"Berndt Weikl is a bore. Siegfried Jerusalem is weak and a poor actor. MariAnne Haggander is pretty and Hermann Prey has celebrity value, but they don't redeem this tedious performance.Go for James Morris and Ben Heppner at the Met. Or, if you really want to hear MEISTERSINGER as it should be, listen to the Bayreuth 1960 live performance, conducted by Knappertsbusch, with Wolfgang Windgassen and Josef Greindl."
1,Disappointing,"These may be the original artist, but these are not the original hits they played on the radio. These are new recordings of the hits. This should be stated in the Amazon ad."
1,"Stay Away From This, or You'll Be Sorry!!!",The songs on this collection (as with many) are NOT the original versions. They've been re-mixed or re-recorded by one or more of the original group members which is mentioned in the fine print of the liner notes. The only problem with that is that I had to find out the hard way by purchasing this disc and then it was too late. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!
2,Disappointed,"I have been awaiting this film's release on video, as it is one of the few early Disney releases I've never seen. Admittedly, ""Music"" is a mixed bag with some very good features and some pretty lame ones. It was nice that they included ""Band Concert"" on the tape too. However, my biggest disappointment was the censoring of ""The Martins and the Coys"" sequence! Why take that out? In reading other viewers' comments, I see that this wasn't the only aspect of the film revised. I can accept that this was one of Disney's compilation films and I wasn't expecting a ""Snow White"". If Disney was going to release the film on video, they should have released the entire thing in its original uncut form!"
1,Anouther censored piece of art.,Disney once again felt they needed to censor one of Walt's classics films. As I said in anouther review I like to watch classic films because they are not PC. I feel Disney should release 2 versions. The same way Dragonball is released. Both edited & uncut versions. That way I can decide what is appropriate for me & my family.
3,make mine music,Disney should have EDITED VERSION printed on the cover to let people know they are not getting the original version of MAKE MINE MUSIC and MELODY TIME
2,Make Mine Music,"I must say this is the most dissapointing Disney effort to date on DVD. To begin with they have edited out the first segnent of the movie. I have no idea why they would do that. Shame on you Disney! Furthermore the quality of the video and aaudio is berlow par. To add insult to injury, Disney all but forces you to wade through a bunch of previews before getting to the main feature. I am now thinking twice about buying any more DVD's from the mouse."
5,"Works better, and smells better...","A fine hair tonic that smells great! It is light, goes on well and doesn't goop up your head/hair with heavy feeling motor oil. Great hair tonic."
2,Oily and smelly,"I bought this product with the hope that it would be similar to the unfortunately discontinued Vitalis hair tonic. In terms of hair conditioning, it is acceptable though oilier than Vitalis. The smell, however, is unbearable. Its reek is comparable to the effect of wearing too much cologne or perfume."
5,very addicting,"this is a very fun game but at this point, i see no point in buying it because Sims 2 is infinitely better. I can honestly say i was addicted to the Sims (and then to The Sims 2) for a long time. I am no longer addicted, but The Sims 3 is coming out in a few months ;)"
2,Yah...,"I played this game with my friends and I ended up getting in trouble. I had played the original ""Sim"" games with my dad and we both enjoyed them, but this...this...well, I really don't know what this is. I saw things like female nudity and gross humor, but I suppose you have to make games over the top to sell them.-Ben Russell"
3,Needs an Editor,"On practically every page there is a spelling or punctation error. Sometimes the mistake changed the whole meaning of the statement. ""Let's prey"" instead of pray, ""Waiting for the raid"" instead of rain. Sometimes I gave up trying to figure out what was really meant.The story was interesting, but the mystery was solved within the first few chapters and it became a story of ""How do we fix the mess?"" I did enjoy the author's descriptions of Thailand & Burma and the little cultural tidbits he threw in, but the frustration of reading with so many errors ruined the experience."
4,Buddha's Mystery Unraveled,"A young woman half-American and half-French, spending the summer in the palace in Bangkok, Thailand with her photographer father didn't waste any time finding a mystery. Lisette Paul came upon the disappearance of the Emerald Buddha very suddenly. With the help of a few new found friends and bustling city, Lisette figures out the Buddha's puzzling disappearance. I liked this book a lot. It was very descriptive. I felt like I was there and could feel and see everything. It also included a lot of truth and real facts about the palace. It combined facts, fiction and mystery all together. Just when you think it's all over, it gets even more intense.Compared to other books, I like this one a lot more than even science fiction, which few books I've read even close to being like this were. On a scale of 1-10 stars, I give this book 8 stars."
4,Invicta Watch,"I bought an Invicta Men's Pro Diver 2-tone 8934. It is built like a tank, keeps perfect time and looks like a Rolex Submariner - only 1/100 of the cost. I am very pleased."
2,Too slow,"The story line was good, but it takes Mark Billingham forever to make a point and get to the climax. When I couldn't sleep, I read 2 or 3 pages of this novel and fell right off."
2,Only Okay,"Tom Thorne is a classically dark, English detective with the usually gang of very human fellow officers. But for that, I never had a real sense of the character. The plot is interesting, but so focused on character that it is way too slow at times and I found myself skimming, and when the killer is exposed I had to go back to figure out when he'd been introduced to the story. I have to admit being disappointed. It was an okay read, but nothing extraordinary."
2,Megaphone volume,"The mini megaphone I ordered was a disappointment because the volume could not be turned loud enough to be heard at the distance I needed within the house. Within a smaller space, it should be adequate."
2,eh no,"this one was no were neer as good as the first one why did she choose john rolfe over John smith John rolfe is a posh bum bum wile john smith was a realy nice guy. i hope there will be a third one where she dumps John Rolfe for John Smith and they moved to Pocahontas's land, that would be good"
5,Great book in a fantastic series,I love these books and order each one as they come out. Fun and easy to read series.
1,not worth buying,"VERY disappointing. I purchased this dvd to show to a group who live in an assisted living facility. There is no dialogue, no explanation of what is being shown. Not recommended."
3,$20 is too much,"Wait til it's on sale or something. Mr. Toad's story is pretty boring, and goes right into it before it show's Icabod Crane's. This ""Gold"" Edition sucks. The sound is terrible.However, the second story will always be a classic."
4,Great movie!,I received the movie quickly and in good condition. A great family movie for the Halloween season. Brings back a lot of memories of when I was a kid! Thank you so much!
5,great classic cartoon,the movie is a great cartoon for halloween and its ok for kidsi would highly recommend these movie for people of all ages
4,A Wacky Thrill Ride.,"In this two part Disney movie, Disney brings you two of the more iconic Disney characters. The wild Mr. Toad, and Ichabod Crane. In the first you are inside a great whimsical story inspired by the Wind in the Willows. You meet Mr. Toad, the rat and mole and along the way encounter a group of finicky weasels. In the second half you meet Ichabod, and encounter the legendary Headless Horseman. They are both good fun. I highly reccomend them."
5,The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad,Such a classic! This is a great movie for halloween. It is such a funny story for back in the day...
3,Disturbing,"I bought this just for the Headless Horseman cartoon. There are two on this disc. The Mr. Toad Adventures, which is the first, sucks. It is psychotic, and scary. Even for an adult. The Headless Horseman story is a classic and worth watching."
1,Does not stand the test of time...,"This feature may have been groundbreaking and awe-inspiring in its day, but animation and children's entertainment has come a long way since then. In short, this piece is dreadfully slow, utterly boring, and guaranteed to put your children to sleep (if it doesn't make them run around crazy, looking for something else to do). For Disney historians, completists, and nostalgians only."
5,Childhood Favorite,"I loved this little movie since I was a kid. Even in my early twenties, I would turn down the lights on Halloween night and watch this on TV. But, they stopped showing it, or at least I couldn't find it and I haven't seen it in quite awhile. I'm planning on watching this as a yearly Halloween tradition."
4,Great memories,"This DVD is a compilation of two shorter Disney films.The Adventures of Ichabod which is Disney's version of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is still as good today as it was when I was a little kid. This movie, is one of those few great Disney films that have been forgotten..another notable would be Tim Burton's short film, Vincent.I didn't care for Mr. Toad as a kid...and I still don't. But the adventures of Mr. Ichabod is well worth the purchase if you are a Disney fan. It's a great Halloween film...and it's got Bing Crosby!"
3,better than the rest,"Yes- it is a pain in the neck, and it is difficult to get the skin taut, and yes it is painful. I have tried all the other brands creams, which burnt my skin so badly especially my underarms. But I still return to Nads it works great on my upper lip and under my chin which I now have hardly any hairs 1 or 2. My legs I'll continue and as one of your reviews said it minimizes the hairs as they slowly grow back. It's all about practicing the technique. One more option other than shaving (ugh) is have a girls get together and help do each others legs. Or have your hubby help you like mine does."
1,Nads is Australian for Painful,"Messy, extremely painful, and after all that screaming it left enough hair that I shaved my legs 2 days later. Those Aussie women must be from tough stock to use this junk on their pits!"
1,"""Two Women"" (Madacy Entertainment)","Never mind the merits of this movie, which won an Oscar. Madacy has... extremely poor quality of the picture. It looks like a 5th generation copy of a VHS tape that has been copied to DVD. Shame on Madacy Entertainment for creating more landfill! I am giving it 1 star because they do not let me give it zero stars."
4,Not so racist...,"I have seen this movie several times and, although it is not a comparable work to ""Roma Citta Aperta"" or ""Bicycle Thieves"", it is good rendition of a superb novel, and deals with the painful transition of the liberation period.I am very disappointed to see a reviewer classify it as racist, because he's ""never heard"" of Moroccan soldiers in Italy. This ignorant standpoint is very unfortunate. Those facts really did happen, the Moroccan troops being part of the French liberation contingent. It is one of the darkest pages in the war in Italy."
3,a suave academic excercise in obscuratinism,"Rose's book is a suave excercise in academic obscuratism, seemingly a book about the of Victorian life it ends up an apology for itself. The story of 5 LITERARY mariages, 2 of which were unconsumated and a third which had ""no smoking gun"" goes at it for 318pp w/o the word homosexuality. The Ruskin-Millias-Love Object Triangle which in its Proustian driven ethos seems archtypal brings un nothing but more suavity. This a book about marriage sans sex or foresight, it's own way as conventional as the Victorians it takes for its subject. Under neath all this stuff what we see is a Professor at a Protestant University who has something to say and which we'd like to hear but are unble to...Maybe next time... or by the time she retires when it is too late...Academic life offers the leisure to think and read, and the double leisure to fear that what is said will erase the former.."
3,WHOLE PREMISE OF BOOK FALLS APART BECAUSE....,"The autopsy states ""that Short was not and had never been pregnant"", also in Severed by John Gilmore, when Elizabeth was in San Diego just before she was murdered she would ask the boy Cory, son of Dorothy French to buy ""sanitary napkins"" and other items for her, does this sound like she was pregnant? This book is good for information about the corruption of the PD but I don't feel it is correct in its conclusion. If I was in charge of the case today I would reopen and ask a coroner there opinion on the findings, apart from a knife used, could the killing have occured at an abbatoir. The criss cross marks on Elizabeth's lip, right hip and vagina, why were they done, the marks on the forehead are they intentional cuts with a message or a result of a blow? The incision on the abdomen why? Was she cut in two for easier handling or for another reason? [...] at least offers possibilities."
3,Interesting Overview,"This guide provides an interesting overview to the Grand Canyon. Parents will find this guide useful in sharing this awesome wonder with their children. However, this guide falls short as a vacation planner."
2,"Great singer, Kelly Marie!","This CD has three different versions of the song which gave name to this album: ""Feels like I'm in love"". Only track one was a big hit in Brazil. Kelly Marie is an excellent singer, indeed. I bought it because I was looking for different versions of the title song. All songs are centered on a loving appeal. Sound quality is level. I gave it two stars because of the strength of the singer, but, to tell you the truth, I was disappointed with this CD. Friends in Brazil share the same opinion about it. It seems that Kelly's record company wished only to create a sex symbol of her. A beautiful voice singer could have reached much further if it weren't for that. Eliezer, Brazil."
4,Great Price!!,Quick delivery-good price. Need one size bigger than shoe size. My daughters love the skates-can assume that they are comfortable. The inside pink padding is a great feature-helps to make the skate more sturdy and comfortable.
5,"Update this description, please","This 2003 edition has been out for quite some time and the description provided by Amazon refers to a previous edition in the collection. I hoped they were just a little behind but with the 2004 edition on the horizon, I hope that Amazon soon changes the book description to reflect the contents of BWE2003 instead of 2001 or whichever ed. this refers to."
1,dont waste your time in aliens,"use a real linux distribution, in your main pc, whit ext2 partition, and whit all your documents secure, and use your old computer to play with windows. don't play with linux"
4,Great Science Fiction,"This is a good thrilling book for any young fan of science fiction. Adults can easily get into it too, which is great for them if they are looking for a quick read.The main character of this tale is sad when her favorite teacher is no longer teaching her class, much to her surprise she finds out that...her teacher is an alien! She enlists the help of a boy classmate of hers and together they work to expose the alien and rescue their original teacher. A pesky bully is also present in this tale, which helps to further relate this book as a tale that young readers can relate to, despite the presence of the alien.There aren't any real morals in this story, but it certainly is entertaining. Its surprise ending for one of the main characters, makes you want to read the rest of the series.Darien Summers, author of The Mischievous Hare, a children's book.The Mischievous Hare"
5,"I couldn't put the book down, great book.","I like the book, My Teacher Is An Alien because I like books about aliens and of suspence. I like the characters. Susan's personality is that of a real fearless explorer. But Smith/Broxholm scares me. He acts weird. He might try and take any one of the kids to his home planet. It keeps the readers reading on."
5,An old favorite!,"Coville's books have a unique charm that makes people wish to read them for years after they've passed the suggested age limit. The title makes it sound like a fifties B movie, but My Teacher is an Alien is far from that. This story, which starts off the quadrilogy (in which ordinary, typical middle school children find themselves trying to save the earth) contains believeable characters, vivid imagery, and a fresh perspective on young reactions to alien invaders."
4,Like having a golf pro on call 24/7,"This book is a great mix of the common-sense and the ""Jeez- I wish I had thought of that""... many of the drills come at ""swing memory"" from slightly different angles- doing 2 or 3 different drills in sequence is really helpful, adding significantly to my confidence over the ball... most of the putting and short game drills are actually fun... I'm looking forward to sharing some of these with my pre-teen daughter on the practice green as a first/light introduction to the game... Well-done, Moyer and Berggoetz!"
3,Mostly enjoyable,"I did like the story, but felt that Amelie's reasons for holding back didn't hold much water at all, so that made her character less believable for me. Things also felt a little rushed towards the end. I thought more space could have been devoted to the rescue attempt and its implications.I've read some of Jarrett's other books and would generally recommend them as light reading. They aren't keepers for me though."
4,"Great show,","Great show, but the CD is not in HD and the sound quality is not amazing ... a little disappointing."
2,ReliaMed Alcohol Pads,"These pads do not have very much alcohol in them. After purchasing them, I determined I could buy the BD Brand (larger pads and much more alcohol on the pad) on the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market shelf every day for $1.14/100 count box--the same I paid for these. At Wal-Mart, I would not have had to pay shipping."
4,1st in the series,"This is a good read and a good beginning to the world of Eberron - I agree with most others that this seems to have a tinge of the Players Guide sprinkled throughout, but, considering that this was written by one of the major sources for Eberron, I would expect no less - moving on to tale #2 and hoping for more story and more character development"
3,"Good action frames wooden characters, cliches","Unfortunately Keith has not fully transferred his prowess as a creative game designer into the field of story telling. I found his plots to be cliche, his characters contrived, and his conceptualization of 'the dreaming dark' to be shallow. The action and build up were well done, but failed to match tension with tempo. What really burns is that given more time and honest effort the story could have really shone. Add a decent edit to remove needless words -- which the story is rife with -- and it could have been an excellent tale.That said, and casting the literary mantle aside, the book WAS fun. Kinda like pink bubble gum and soda pop. Overall, it will be a good and enjoyable read for those who like pulpy action in the vein of R.A. Salvatore and other game fiction authors."
4,Great introduction to Eberron,"This is an adventure novel that pulls you in to the fantasy world of eberron. The book is highly readible and is great for those who are interested in the eberron campaign setting.Altough the author of this book clearly didn't intend to write literature it's detective style makes it an interesting read. You can finish it within a day and that plus the extremely good appendix makes it perfect for RPG players wanting inspiration for a true in-depth adventure game.Within this genre is clearly deserves a good rating:4 stars!now i'm looking for book II, ;-)"
3,"not dull, not sparkling","The premise was promising; the execution was less than promised. Not a bad read, but I wished I'd spent my time on something more fulfilling."
4,A great book for book club!,"I found this book fascinating and thought it would be great for book club as all my friends I discussed it with had different opinions about woman's roles in relation to this book. I thought the book jumped back and forth a bit between sections about the different men and sections regarding the authors marriage, a long trip home and her son. I still think it paints an interesting portrait of her quest and the happenings in relation to that."
3,Eddie Kantar Teaches Modern Bridge Defense,It was not suitable for my purposes- I am teaching a bridge class of 40 people on all levels. I ended up downloading videos.
5,"Read it at least 5 times, it's worth it","This is a great book on defense, because Kantar covers almost every intermediate situation comprehensively and give you black and white rules for every situation. He doesn't in this book consider varied leading/signalling conventions but just gives one way to play, but that's fine as he explains his method clearly and shows why he recommends everything he does. I'd recommend it to every player."
3,"GREAT DANCING, LOUSY MOVIE","Does anyone take note of Cynthia Rhodes in this movie? She's the blonde they call ""Tina Tech"". She also had roles in the movies Dirty Dancing and Staying Alive, the sequel to Saturday Night Fever. Talk about a dancer! She was magnificent!!! Whatever happened to her anyway?"
2,"Good dancing, Bad Movie, No DVD Extras","I was 3 or 4 when this movie came out so I never got to see it until now. I'm into b-boying (breakdancing) and that's why I got this DVD. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Soundtrack is top-notch for a movie from 1983. The movie had an extremely weak plot. Like others have said, what is Hannah's relationship to Alex? Why did she go to confessional all the time and then have sex with her bf 2 minutes later?My biggest gripe is what happened to the break-dancing scene? I've seen that part of the movie in numerous break-dancing tapes and the scene in the DVD was much shorter. I mean they showed Crazy Legs 3 times, Frosty once, and the 2 poppers, but where was Prince Ken Swift? This movie is supposedly what brought break-dancing into the mainstream back in the early 80s, but yet the DVD which has no features at all, shortens it a lot.This DVD gets a generous 2-stars from me and only because of the good audio."
3,My Rating,"I chose this rating only because of the lack of experienced acting. The dancing was very good. I would like to sit and watch this with with my daughter, It is a true classic."
2,Warhip Jamz,This was not the product I had intended to get for my daughter. There was no warning or description regarding the difference between this CD and the 2 disc version. We were mislead into buying this product and are very disappointed.
4,watch out for the size,"Feels nice and looks nice but when it came it was waaaaay too small. The Amazon sizing chart must be off for swimwear or Speedo's sizing is off. Dunno. I wear size 34 jeans and just about anything else, however this is more like a 32... Just be aware of this. You might want to go at least 2 sizes higher when ordering..."
4,Good idea but...,"I bought this for extra storage space in the attic. They arrived quickly without a scratch. A six pack does not cover that much space however. For the price it was easier and cheaper to put down some plywood giving me more space to walk and store stuff. Also, be CERTAIN that the studs are 16 inches... in typical wall construction studs are placed 16 inches on center, it is also typical that depending on your roof/ceiling type that the floor studs are NOT always 16 inches apart."
4,rugged construction,"Had to go hunting for a holster for my husband's Nextel ""wheel chock"" phone. There's not many options out there due to the phone's obsolete construction. However, this item fits the bill perfectly for the price. It's made from a durable canvas material, with a great metal clip for your belt. As other reviewers stated, don't know how long the velcro will hold up due to constant opening to remove the phone, but for there aren't many other options out there, and for the price, it's a good value."
5,Delightful!,"Despite what one reviewer said, silly is funny to a child... and even to a grown up that enjoys children. I found this and all of ""The Last ..."" tales delightful and my daughter has enjoyed them for years. I highly recommend these tales for children (and good-humored parents)."
2,Not for the pre-K crowd,Little hands are begging to break the spindly plastic arms on this thing. It seems like it would be a lot of fun for kids over 8. The facts are pretty generic and the questions are also very basic. This is not a motor inside the center causing the planets to revolve around the sun but the sun Does light up. This toy is jut OK.
1,"Alright Ken Griffey Baseball game, but the 64 versions are a lot better","not a bad game by any means, but the Nintendo 64 versions are just so much better. I would rate this game 2 stars."
5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT","This is THE pet owners best friend. It gets all the loose hair off in one or to swipes. Be gentle with it though, don't press down. After the first few times you only need to brush with it once a week, really keeps the shedding down. ( I have 3 dogs, what a blessing)"
1,Broke after just a few uses,"This 2-in-1 seems like a good idea, but it is not built very sturdily. It broke after just a couple of uses. What a waste."
4,Good Read,"I'm on a Bette Ford kick this week. I loved the story and plot. However I thought the story was draged out to long. Zach knew he wanted the marriage to work. Amanda was to blind to see that Zach was not like her drunk father. I wanted to reach in the book and SLAP her a few times. I also feel like a lot of info was missing. Like what was up with her mother? Why Zach's mom, brother, and a distance cousin didn't like Amanda? There was not a lot to go on. The ending kind of ticked me off. I feel like sequel to the book was need with Barbara and Brad. Maybe we could have had more history of the family. Like how the heck family gonna marry family. Over all a good read."
4,You could actually feel this story,Zach truly loved Amanda. But she had real issues she needed to address. I was in Zach's corner the whole time. Girlfriend just could never relax and accept what he wanted to give her. But the end was good. The book was an easy read.
5,great,this is one of my absolute favorite novels. great line and plot. i fell in love with this book. i'm in love with all of bette ford's books. she has a gift and i offer it to you all.
1,"No instructions; ""thrifty"" = ""cheap & poor quality""","This was a very disappointing set to receive. The box came with absolutely NO instructions and a defective clamp for one of the lights. The strange thing is that the set has decent stands, but everything else is extremely cheap and low-quality. When I was finally able to correctly assemble (I think) one of the lamps with it's umbrella reflector, the whole lamp and umbrella fell over as if the flimsy ball-clamp couldn't hold the weight.I understand value and that you can't get a Mercedes for a Yugo price. But the clamps for these lamps are terrible and the lack of instructions is inexcusable. You can get decent reflector clamp/workshop lights at Lowes and Home Depot for $9 a piece. This would probably be a better investment.As this set sits now, it's unusuable. I'll need to return it and waste more money on shipping."
1,"barely usable, maybe","I second the above comments. This kit is difficult to figure out how to put together, difficult to put together, and doesn't fit well or work well when it is put together. The single nut that both adjusts the clamp that holds the reflector to the stand and the umbrella is poorly designed and barely functions. I could not tighten it enough to get the reflector to stay pointed above the horizontal even without the umbrella.Maybe some salvagable parts, and maybe useful for some tabletop photos destined for eBay. Maybe."
4,Solid basic calculator,"This is your basic calculator. It's small, lightweight. Great for a student or for home use. I wouldn't use it for counting millions. ;)It's solar powered which is a plus but it doesn't have a manual off button.Definitely worth the price."
3,Not what I expected,"Let's face it...it's only a calculator! However, for the price I thought I might get a little bigger and better quality. The buttons have a cheap feel and the size is smaller than your typical desk calculator. If you really don't care then just get it...it's only $10, but if you want a little better for your money then shop your local office supply store."
2,Small calculator as the size of a standard wallet,"If you are looking for an office-size calculator like I do, this product is NOT for you."
1,Goofy !,"I'm going to break from everyone's reviews here and say that I found this movie to be annoying, cheesy, and just plain dumb. I guess that's why everyone liked it, but I for one didn't. My husband thought it was great, my kids think it's great, and I can't wait to return it to the library.If there's one thing I'm sick of, it's fathers being portrayed in the media as bumbling idiots...or insensitive control freaks and all the children in Disney movies it seems disrespect their parents.I cannot think of a single Disney movie with a positive role model for a dad and with children who respect him, with the exception of Ol' Yeller, and in that case, the father is gone for 90% of the film.Goofy is yet another addition to the ""Stupid Fathers"" club, and I'm disappointed to say the least, but not surprised. I only gave this one star because I can't give it zero."
4,Great Movie,This is one of my favorite Disney movies and is a staple of my child hood. I was so thankful to find it on Amazon and not only that but it was an affordable price. I was able to order it quickly and it arrived in a timely manner!
4,one song haunted me from this album for three years,"I first heard Dave Carter by chance when I was stuck in traffic one dreary Monday morning on the way to work. I caught ""Workin' for Jesus"" (track 9 on this album) in the middle as I was messing with the radio, and was mesmerized. I couldn't believe the man's voice--it was so strange and almost too sweet to be human. I waited to find out who he was and where I could get the album, but the station went out of range. I've been googling the title for years trying to track it down. Finally! I love this album; how smart and heartbreaking and sincere it is. Dave can get a little new-agey for me on some of his songs, but when he's really good his voice is like a kevlar piercing bullet--it can puncture the most cynically armored heart."
3,Fun Track,"A, Stop the Rock (Album Version). AA, Stop the Rock (Mint Royal Mix). AAB, Stop the Rock (Gigolo Stop the Jocks Mix). B, Raw Power (Urban Takeover Mix). BB, Krupa (USA).Something to get the party started I think. Nothing heavy on here otherwies."
5,"Takes over where ""Priestesses' Left Off","This book is the glossy version of 'Priestesses', which I reviewed earlier in the year. It has a lot of photos, good information and inspiration for those interested in learning about women's religious roles outside of Abrahamic traditions."
1,Painfully Terrible,"I really, really tried to like this movie. I also tried hard to stick it out till the end. Don't think I even made it halfway through. It has potential but I don't know - tires too hard perhaps...I get the point but it just didn't play out well. Disappointing."
2,The director scratched on this one...,"I was hoping this was going to be another awesome movie with great pool shots like ""Poolhall Junkies"" but if you're looking for that kind of movie from""Stickmen"" then this is not the movie for you. Most of the pool table scenes are cut away camera shots, that is you see the player line up his shot and shoot and then the camera cuts to the view of the ball going into the pocket, so you can be pretty sure these guys can't play pool. Unfortunately neither can the director as he left two scenes in where the players clearly make push shot fouls on the cue ball. Seems the movie is more about the rules of pool and how they apply to your life, that is if your life is about beers, bars, and shagging. As one reviewer said the theme of the movie is old, and I found the acting, filming, and pool playing mediocrity at best. The only redeeming feature is the part played by Kirk Torrance who is cast in the role of narrator/quasi-villian which is why I gave this movie a two."
2,829 telltale signs...NOT!!!,This book just lists the same signs over and over again in each chapter. Most of it is common sense stuff. Save your money and use your own brain. You will do better on your own.
3,"Tangentially interesting, but meandering and pointless","Who cares if the king of Laos died 23 years ago or 21 years ago? I was hoping to learn more about the country, history, and people, but this was the wrong book. This guy goes on a crusade that never gripped me; the minor details he mentions in passing were much more interesting than his quest. There must be more interesting books about Laos than this."
1,Ridiculously goofy!!,"This book was nothing like the films... so juvenile and poorly written, I had to laugh when Freddy would make a kill. There were no scary things about this book just a goofy, comically stupid Freddy Kreuger, who wrestles a boy to death in tights,and turns into a zombie and eats the brains of another girl.Also, this novel took an eternity to go anywhere. The characterization was so painful to get through, I almost gave up on the book 3/4 way through. Then the book gets so far-fetched as Freddy slaughters the whole high school on a crazed rampage.I would skip this one. It doesnt have any relevance to the movies and is so comically stupid, I cant see how anyone can enjoy it."
4,A very thorough and comprehensive biography,Scholarly and very prefessional. A rare insight into the life of Mehmed Celebi. Well-balanced and soberly written. Only point of critique is that for some reason the author persists in using the modern Turkish names for cities which were Byzantine at the time of the events described. This does become a little annoying when using this book with primary sources. Apart from that - splendid!
3,Thinking Man's Spy Movie,"Although it's set in the 60's, it holds up today. Think of it as a period piece and remember it was during the cold war. You have to think Michael Caine turned this down because it's so close to his spy movies. There's no thrilling chases or Bond-type tricks, just plodding pursuit of his quest. However the enemy just lets him go twice and that will spoil it for the real thinkers. Just enjoy it and try to forget George in his ""Just Shoot Me"" TV role."
1,Overrated,"I went to see Man Man play live at McCarren Park in Brooklyn after hearing great things about their live performances, but honestly, I wasn't impressed. Their sound was distorted and while the costumes were interesting they offered nothing new in terms of sound. Think of a Junior Varsity version of Mr. Bungle. Way overrated."
5,Inventive fun that never Ends........,"Anyone who enjoys the inventivness of Zappa, the deep caverns of Tom Waits or the other worldly 16/4 of Captain Beefheart look no further then the delightfully playfull debut of Philly's Man Man. These guys breath new life into the contemporary lifeforce of music in 2005. Enjoyable to the point of tears..........."
1,Not so natural afterall,"We were considering these wipes until we found that some of the ingredients are considered to cause allergies and other health problems. The product title is somewhat misleading ""naturally refreshing"" has nothing to do with natural ingredients. Buyer beware![...]"
5,Wonderful,This bra fits great and washes beautifully. I will purchase another soon. [Bali Women's Double Support Spa Closure Wire-Free Bra]
5,Great bra!,This is the most comfortable bra I have had in a long time. The Amazon experience was great. Shipment was very quick. Very satisfied customer.
5,Great Bras & Great Prices at Amazon,"I have purchased these Bali bras for over a year. I have them in white, grey, black and beige. They wash well and don't show any sign of wear. I line dry my bras instead of using the dryer so maybe that helps keep them looking better. They are comfortable and supportive."
2,Ouch!,"I am a 36DD, 27 y.o. female and I was looking for a bra that could support me and at least be a little cute for me to wear under shirts with no cleavage popping out. I tried this bra out and it dug into my skin. I like the look of it but, obviously, comfort comes first. I tried to send it back but it must have been lost en route back to Amazon because I haven't heard anything about it."
4,PIGMANS LEGACY,THE PIGMANSLEGACY THE BOOK THE PIGMANS LEGACY BY PAUL ZINDELWAS A TERRIFIC BOOK. I LIKE THE BOOK BECAUSE IT SHOWED WHAT ONES LOVE CAN DO. THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A MAN NAMED GUS WHO IS ONE THE RUN FROM THE TAX COLLECTOR. JOHN AND LORRAINE WHO ARE HIGH SCHOOLERS HELPS THE COLONELAND FINDS TRUE LOVE AMONG THEMSELVES.THE AGE GROUP WHO WOULD READ THIS WOULD BE 12 YRS AND OLDER.
4,A great follow-up,"This book is a terrific follow-up to The Pigman. Thankfully, it was not a carbon copy of it, although it did include some o fthe same elements: a lonely old man who the teens befriend. The conclusion involving John and Lorraine is extremely satisfying for anyone who, like me, wanted more than the last book provided."
4,Not your everyday holiday music,"This CD works well for the holidays, but is not limited to holiday use. The Renaissance instrumentals are upbeat, yet classic, and well-performed. It would be enjoyable background music at a dinner or low-key party. I would have liked it to be a bit longer playing CD."
4,heard taped version and found it inspirational,"though i would have liked to have seen more detail on each individual . . . inspirational and got me thinking: i still have a long way to go . . . in fact, we all do!"
1,Overpriced basic advice,"I read this not too long ago. Here's the message of this book in a nutshell-If you're messing up, leave the devil alone and go to God. THERE! Now you can save your money and let the Right Reverend Deacon Dr. Bishop [...], OOPS! I mean Jakes, look elsewhere for desperate people without common sense to help pay for his cadillacs!"
4,Awesome,"This book is great especially for fathers and husbands. I think not only men should read this but also women. Bishop Jakes has done it again. Truly awesome. After reading it myself I went back and bought one for my brothers, sons, ex and friend."
5,Good quality copy,"I'm not going to comment on the actual series... except to say that I enjoyed ""Wild Palms"" very much, having missed out when it was first broadcast.The video quality is acceptable (you'll just have to live with the fact that this was made when 4/3 TV was the norm), but don't expect too much on the audio side. You're only getting 192 kbps stereo AC3 sound; though let's remember this was a TV production."
1,Wild Hype,"This ABC produced mess was hype without substance. It passes for edgy intelligent techno whatever because it was aimed at the great middle brow. It is Oliver Stone trading on his name and rapidly falling clout. This thing was produced in the shadow of JFK and the afterglow of Natural Born Killers, or back when people still thought Oliver Stone had something to say. After U Turn, Any Given Sunday and Alexander, most of us know better. Oliver Stone is a Tony Scott level director with sophmoric political insights. Finding anything deep in this made for TV event is like championing 12 Monkeys over the films of Chris Marker"
4,Priced Right,"The quality is pretty bad. It looks just like my old VHS tapes, but it's a great show and you can't really complain because they are selling it so cheaply. It would be great to get a clean widescreen edition, but I'm grateful to have this one."
4,Great show,I was impressed with this mini-series when it was shown on Dutch television 10 years ago. Finally I got to buy a good version on DVD from somebody on eBay. I can hardly wait for the official DVD-version.
2,Enough is enough already!,"I've read every Midnight Louis book to date, but I probably won't finish this one. For starters, it meanders in and out of the characters' brains, probing, ad nauseum, their unresolved doubts and fears. If you haven't read the other books in the series, I have no idea how you'll catch on to what is happening in this one. What's more, why would you care? None of these people are appealing, as they were in earlier books. The first few chapters are maudlin and the mystery is boring. I get the impression the author is treading water with the book's plot in order to keep the series' plot alive. At this point they both look half-drowned to me. Add to that the incessant similes and metaphors that are becoming extremely annoying and you have a book that is hard to pick up and easy to put down. I loved the Irene Adler series and I enjoyed the early Midnight Louis books, but Cat in a Leopard Spot is too irritating for words."
2,I agree with 'Enough already',"Except for two things - I gave up on Irene Adler when I read that Chapel Noir was volume one and Chapel Rouge volume two. I feared more Chapels. I do keep reading Midnight Louie's adventures but the later ones aren't as much fun as the early ones. If I'd have known I would have to read 27 books, I would never have picked up Blue Monday."
5,Hermitage Art and Alzheimer's,"Helen, a mother and woman with rapidly developing Alzheimer's recalls her days as a guide at the Hermitage Art Museum in Leningrad during the city's WWII destruction. All of the art was removed and hidden for safe keeping, yet even though the paintings are gone, each frame is left hanging on the walls. She and another woman friend wander through the Hermitage bringing the framed blanks alive by recalling and memorizing each painting in vivid detail. The staff moved to the basement during the bombings in starvation conditions. Juxtaposed is Helen's family's struggle to deal with her failing memory and not understanding Helen's confused comments, her disorientation between past and present. A tightly written double story about repressed memories and each family member's facing their mother's or wife's missing present. Well done."
5,Transcending the Horrors of War Through Art,"I loved this book. It is about a woman in war-torn Leningrad during World War II. She looks with sorrow at the empty museum surrounding her. She gazes at the blank spaces on the wall where paintings used to be and visualizes them. This enables her to rise to the greatest heights of hope and spirituality despite the realities of death, war and starvation all around her.This is a great novella and I highly recommend it."
3,they made it right,i ordered a 'very good' condition book which was not 'very good'. i wrote inand the company refunded my money quickly and apologized for the error.
5,For Art Lovers,"The Madonnas of Leningrad is a very moving book. I had planned a trip to Russia to see the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. My trip never happened but by reading this book, I felt like I had seen the paintings at the museum. I loved this book! Anyone who loves art would enjoy reading this wonderful account of how Russians love their art."
2,It was okay.,The book started off well but focused on the present instead of the very interesting past. I felt it just ended without answering some questions.
3,"Great topic, not so great application","In The Madonnas of Leningrad, the author did a wonderful job of describing the desolation and desperation felt by those who remained in Leningrad for that horrible winter. That's about it though. The characters lacked depth, the plot left several loose ends, and though the depiction of the treasures from the museum was fascinating, it also went on a little too long. If you are interested in this particular period of Russian history, I suggest Kristin Hannah's Winter Garden. The emotions are much more real and the characters more developed."
4,Art & history lesson,"To anyone who has visited the Hermitage, this look back at what happened during the seige of Leningrad will be a rewarding read. Debra Dean clearly has done extensive and detailed research to paint a picture of what life was like during that horrendous time - and how some managed tosurvive. She intertwines the current life of two of them, and the story unfolds through flashbacks. An interesting footnote is these two main characters reside in Seattle, as does the author.Viewing the Hermitage website adds another dimension to discussions of the artwork saved from the German attacks."
5,A Classic in its own RIGHT.,One of Terror's best albums. I wish he would make A smashing return for the new millenium;if not I'll catch him at the sound clashes.. BACHMENT TING !!!!!
1,"Lousy product, Lousy company","I purchased a Sony portable DVD player this time last year. Big mistake. It stopped working shortly after the 90 day warranty and Sony would do nothing but let me pay them for a repair/exchange. So I paid for an exchange + Shipping. Then the replacement they sent (same model) would not even turn on. Then they offer to let me pay to send that one back too (months have transpired because they do not send a replacement until they have logged in and assessed the one you send back). Meanwhile, I still have nothing. Sony charge me $500 for a lemon product and will not stand behind it. I will never purchase a Sony product again."
4,"""Freeze!""",Gotta admit I love the little thing BUT when I play my home made DVDs on it has a slight freezing problem and the funny thing is that it doesn't happen to all of them. Cleaning the disc and the lens won't do the job either. Other than that I really can't complain about it. I'd still recommend it.
5,obscure because he choose it. Top class flamenco guitarist,"He plays with a lot of crisp strong precision. It has all the lyrical melodies or joyous rhumba or fliud driving rhythm or a mean bulerias as expected from the best players.The reason he's not well known or famous is because he chose to play for himself alone or with afictionados. No large concert schedule and only one Vinyl. See his video on U-tube. 30yrs ago he was living out of one room backing onto a garden with shared bathroom in a good London neighbourhood. He liked to teach guitar from his bed-room sometimes. He used to teach me.As you would expect from an artist who shunned the lime-light, he has an awful lot of integrity and so you will not be disappointed .He built himself a guitar as well as taught himself to play as a teen. Then went to to finishing school with the gypsies in Spain. Sadly Philip John Lee passed on a year ago or so (2010/11)"
2,don't take this movie seriously,"or you'll dread it's stupidity. there is a strong message throughout the film about the kids being able to accept a new man in their life. Ice Cube is quite good in this role, I was impressed! However, I don't consider making faces at the camera acting. heck, i could do that. yes, I'm talking about the boy in the film. the director doesn't even let him act so how are we supposed to like him? & yes, I think this movie is a little cruel at points and I dreaded it for that. it stopped being a fun film and instead just became a dull & hated film. I give points for effort, mostly on Ice Cube's part! but this film is awful. it has nothing that stands out, the message could've been delivered better, though I do like the fact that it did have one! so it wasn't completely pointless, I just felt it could've been done in so many better ways. I thought this film was a major let down and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone ever."
1,Is This Movie Over Yet?,"That's what movie fans will say when they see this film. This makes Mr.Nanny look like Citizen Kane(The 1941 film). At least when Mr.Nanny did the Home Alone Slapstick,it was still popular at the time but when Are We There Yet? did it,it was made in 2005 when the Home Alone slapstick was old and dated. They also ruined Ice Cube. He use to be the bad boy of the N.W.A rapping group then he turned into a slapstick goof in this film. The acting and 99.9% of the movie is cartoony and over-the-top. It might been passable in the 1980's or even the 1990's but that [bleep] won't fly in the 2000's. I give this [bleep] a 0 out of 10."
1,"It's a movie, it's an ad, but mostly it's a waste of time","Oh okay, I may have smiled once...with the ending credits. Though the previews looked sort of promising, this movie is absurd without being funny, illogical without being clever and so chock full of cliches and bad acting that the camera itself seems uncomfortable. To top it off, a large part of the movie seems like a paid advert for the Lincoln Navigator. So the joke's on us."
4,In the right direction,"One of the very few bands that take on the Soft's/Zeuhl/RIO tradition and do so well. Without being prententious, predictable, overintellectualised or strained they perform some relaxed pieces which often even seems to stretch the format a little bit. This could be developed further. So to reach perfection some more originality would be advised."
5,Supervolano is a winner,Arrived sooner than I expected. Brilliantly edited. A great story I'd been longing to have for ages before I bought it.
1,Might have been good if it had been viewable :(,Could not view the movie (it was not viewable in my region) is what kept coming up on the screen...very frustrating
4,Some nice jams,"Again this album is good, not great. A lot of nice jams on it. He could have accomplished so much more if he wasn't shot in 1980."
2,But there is one great song....,"I love John, but this is one of his worst albums. If you're sampling his work for the first time, obviously ""Imagine"" or ""Plastic Ono Band"" are the two albums that are essential. This album is dominated by sub-par music with the exception of the hit single, ""Mind Games.""But there is one outstanding and almost unknown track on this album and is one of John's better ballads, ""You Are Here."" In this love song to Yoko, John sings it in an understated and simple way, right from the heart. The lyrics and melody are beautiful, reminiscent of ""Jealous Guy"" and ""Love.""It's worth buying for this track alone."
4,Life Without Yoko,"This may be John's most overlooked album due to the somewhat muddy sounding production. If you prefer John when he was a Beatle, you'll probably like ""I Know I Know""."
2,It Ain't Real...,"John Lennon wrote some of the most affecting music in pop history. To say he was capable of transcendant, brilliant work would in no way be an overstatement. Just listen to any one of his Beatles tracks, or any from his first two solo discs. And then listen to this...This is Lennon craftsmanship (as opposed to artistry...) Cliches abound (""Freeda Peeple"", ""Out The Blue"", ""Intuition"")...and Lennon the craftsman does not equal McCartney. John can't turn a tune like Paul, and never could...The title cut is as close as he gets to anything of real merit, but the production is shrill and tinny. Too bad McCartney and Martin weren't around. No, it had to be real with John. and if it ain't, don't bother. And it ain't."
2,marginal cowboy music; ok commercial country,"This cd is a departure from the true cowboy music in MMM's prior cowboy cd's. It has a ""country"" hue that may please MMM's early fans who long for his return to that category."
3,"Nice price, but they run out very quickly.","Tired of paying through the nose for ink cartridges for my little printer, I decided to try these out.Quick shipping, arrived intact, and in the quantity I ordered.They fit and seem to have no problems with installation.They seem to run out very quickly though, compared to the ones I buy in Best Buy or Target.One of them had a ""blank line"" for its entire life, but it only lasted for a dozen pages or so, so it was no big deal.I probably will buy them again, but will ALSO buy one of the real ones from the store to print out ""important"" papers.You get what you pay for ..."
4,The snap at the neck makes all the difference,"I'm usually not a good sleeper on a plane, but this combined with ear plugs and sleep mask have made all the difference. It holds your head up, doesn't slide around, and you're less likely to wake with a kink. I do wish the fabric was a little softer, but the trade-in for being inflatable is worth it."
1,Uncomfortable,"I bought two of those for travel to Europe. Both of them broke (had holes in the seam area) after coule of uses.Besides, in my opinion extra cushions on the sides are unnecessary. I had a pillow before with a simple design and was happy with it, and my next pillow will be without any extra cushions and buttons."
2,Susan's review,"The seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable. The extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support don't measure up. THe snaps that should hold the ends together don't work. Basically, it would be OK if it came with a soft cover."
1,"Not nice, uncomfortable","This is the kind of item that can only sell if all you have to make a decision is the photo. Whereas I travel for work constantly, I thought I could use this travel pillow. Forget it. It's got a sharp plastic seam running along the inner part that touches your neck. That doesn't feel good.The other design flaw is actually the shape. The back part, what goes behind your neck, should be thin but it's wide. That means when you ""wear"" this, your head will be unnaturally bent forward. Ouch!Don't get it."
1,A big disappointment,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as I am a big Adam Sandler fan. The previews were funny, but the rest of the movie was really lame and irritating. I do NOT recommend this one. Pass this up."
1,Over the Top,"I watched this movie knowing that it might be too over-the-top and sadly, it was. I can take Adam Sandler in small amounts or supporting roles. Had he acted opposite a real woman and a better developed story, I may have liked the movie better. However, his role as the sister was just too much and downright annoying. I couldn't even make it through half of the movie. If you are a huge Adam Sandler fan, you might like this movie. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
2,pretty lame,Adam Sandler is another one who's movies just keep getting worse (like Sasha Baron Cohen). I don't know why producers think more crass = more funny. A couple of humorous moments but I don't recommend this one.
5,Great movie,Movie was great had so many great punch lines and cast. Watched with my girlfriend and mom. Easily one of Adam sanders best movies.
2,Don't waste your money,"I am a Happy Gilmore, Billy Maddison, Big Daddy fan and this doesn't even come close. I think I laughed once through the entire movie and my wife actually fell asleep. Some movies you have to see in the theater some you can wait until they come out to rent and this one you can just pass on all together. Don't waste your time."
1,awful,"I rented this movie on my kindle thinking I would enjoy it. I was so wrong... the whole movie to me was not funny and weird... Adam sandler is funny but this movie was just awful... not his best movie. If you want to see a funny movie of his buy or rent just go with it, or grown ups... dont waste your money or time on jack and Jill..."
3,Jack and Jill,"Thought it was going to be another funny movie from Sandler, I was disapointed.It did have some funny parts but you saw most of them in the previews.Sorry, i wont recommend seeing this movie."
3,Not My All Time Fav,"In the realm of Sandler films, this was not one of my favorites. It was pretty funny, but not hysterical like some of Sandler's other films."
2,Not For Me,"My wife drug me, kicking and screaming, to see the movie thinking I would enjoy it once I saw it. Well not only did I not like the movie, she left it saying it was by far the worst Adam Sandler movie she has seen, and she is a HUGE Sandler fan. I know there are those that will say I don't understand or appreciate his comedy or other comments like that, but in this case it was just a bad movie.I did not enjoy the storyline, and was not entertained by the movie at all. I can't believe Al Pachino was in the movie and played had such a horrible role. I would not spend any money to rent this movie, let alone buy the DVD. I think I would rather watch paint dry!"
5,A GOOD MOVIE!!!!,"I loved this movie, my family loved this movie. I laughed sooo much. DO NOT listen to the negative reviews. Adam Sandler ROCKS!!!"
1,.H O R R I B L E !!!,"Seriously - this movie could be considered a cruel and inhuman form of torture. It's absolutely excruciating. The ""Jill"" character is HORRIBLE. I couldn't even bring myself to watch the full movie. It was too painfully hard to sit through watching that character - who by the way is NOT in the least bit funny.I usually enjoy Sandler's movies, but this one is a big stinky elephant dump."
2,Not so good,"We love Adam Sandler, this was just our least favorite Adam Sandler movie to date. We wanted to like it and it was just not very good. My 10 year old and I watched it together and, although he found it more entertaining than I, we were both still not impressed."
2,Eh - not up to par,"Of all the Saddler movies, I do not think this one even comes close. Videography wise they do a great job of editing but story line -- not."
5,Great Movie!!,"Just hilliarious, classic Sandler, loved it, really showed a new dimension to his acting ability. Loved that he was willing to play a woman"
3,Its one of those its so dumb it's funny type movies.,"It's a Sandler movie. Either you are a fan and find him funny or you don't. I find him funny. I get a laugh out of the stupid humor.Its not on the top of the list of his funniest but its up there. It's actually quite surprising the amount of celebrities he got to make cameo's in the movie.If you like stupid humor check this movie out. If you don't, pass on it."
1,Does not last...,"This product did not really work on me. First when I applied it, it got on my skin and it was very hard to take it away, very hard. I wash my face 2 times a day so maybe it is the reason why it did not last but I really expected something better than that."
5,GOOD BOOK ABOUT GREAT HOTEL,"This is local history at its best. The account is detailed and entertaining, with lots of fascinating historical photos. I highly recommend THE GRAND LADY OF FOURTH AVENUE."
5,Get this back in print!,"This is the best university text on traditional microeconomics in the English language. Its only rival is George Stigler's ""Price Theory"". Written with wit and humor by a masterful writer. McCloskey is not a theorist or a failed mathematician; he is a historian and a student of human beings."
2,Poor thing falls apart!,"When this card reader worked, it was AWESOME! I carried it around in my purse and pulled it out whenever anyone needed a card read... any size!Then it started to come apart. The smaller cards still work but the main one (for me) is the SD card for my camera. That no longer works.I went out and replaced it with a more stable unit... one by Dynex. It's more stable."
2,feh,"Yea, it works, but it's a cheap circuit board inside a couple of pieces of cheap plastic. Don't expect it to be in one piece for more than 6 months."
4,recommended bridge book for advanced players,a must book for advanced players. every hand is special. i like the book because it teaches how to think bridge
2,"good video, unlistenable sound quality","This is a wonderful, exciting, moving rendition of Mahler 2, the picture is crisp and two of the three speeches are included. The most dramatic and important speech, by then Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was taken out for reasons beyond my knowledge. If you're interested in listening to the music, buy the CD. The sound on the video is perfectly awful. The level is absurdly low and turning up the volume only amplifies the hiss, behind which there is a muddy, indistinct shadow of the music. I only bought the video, in a moment of maudlin nostalgia, because I happen to be in it, playing my trumpet as a bright-eyed kid. I don't understand the point of producing a music video without paying attention to the sound. This technical incompetence is an embarrassment and a disservice to the musicians not to mention the listeners."
5,This is the Frankie Avalon and Annette Show,"Buy this video if you like Frankie and Annette since this is a 1hr show in black and white and has them both together singing and dancing from February 16,1965 with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello hosting and singing songs and dancing.Frankie Avalon and Annette sing the song ""All I need is The Girl""/""All I Need is The Boy"".Frankie and Annette sing ""Beach Party"" and ""Love Letters in The Sand"" and other beach songs.Frankie does a comedy interview with Don Adams.This video shows that Frankie and Annette should have had their own show.They are good together.If you like Frankie and Annette movies then you should enjoy this video.Frankie and Annette are at their best like they always are."
3,From Back Cover,"MR. AUGUST - The Montana Man: He'd lived for his son and the land--until she came into his life...His Mystery Woman: She was called Sierra. She was beautiful and vulnerable, and he felt an immediate connection to her.All rancher Clint Barrow knew was her name. But from the first he'd needed to stake his claim. He'd brought her hometo heal, but as the days stretched into long, hot nights, Clint wanted the woman herself. And just when their denied desire exploded into full-blown passion, Sierra's past began to come clear. Would she soon have to leave her Montana man behind?"
2,one star for each good song on the album,"Most of the songs on this album are very self indulgent. That's great if you just want art, but not if you want to sell CDs. There are 2 well known, and listenable songs."
4,Great characters.,Great recovery from a horrible Season 6. Watch it on my Kindle while on the treadmill and the hour passes quickly.
3,"Good, but not for me.","I can't stand the texture of this product. It doesn't feel like cream... it almost feels gritty (even though everything rubs in). The scent is mild and seems alright at first, but it kind of ""grows off"" you. Once I have it on a few minutes, I start to find it irritating. It's okay for a hand cream, I wouldn't recommend it as a face cream at all. It indeed softens your skin well, but for the price, there are better products."
1,Buyer Beware,"I was excited to receive Hope in a Jar for Christmas but after a few uses developed a horrible, raised, itchy red rash all over my face and developed very sensitive dry skin. Thinking that perhaps daily use was too much at first I decided to try it again - the rash started developing about 8 hours later and got worse even after washing my face with a gentle cleanser. Took about 5 days before my skin was back to normal.I've never had this type of reaction to a product before and will stick to Philosophy scents as opposed to skin products."
1,"SMELLS VERY, VERY BAD...NO HOPE FOR THIS","I got this with a kit that I bought from Philosophy. I LOVE Philosophy, their fragrances, body washes, shampoos, creams etc. However, I have to be truthfull...I was so excited to try this product...however when I opened the jar...the smell almost bowled me over. I can't even describe it...YUK>>>AWFUL....I thought maybe it was just that jar so I found another in Sephora in Manhattan and BINGO...same smell. I can honestly say that I don't know if it works as I just couldn't get past the awful smell...it was making me gag. Never had anything like that happen before. Read the reviews on [...]....I was suprised others felt the same way.Just my opinion, plenty of people love it...NOT ME."
1,SMELLS AWEFUL PERIOD,I regret purchasing this product.smells disgusting and it lingers in my face all day long.moisturizing effect is just as good as other things. so buy other product. NOT THIS
1,break out,"I decided to try Hope in the Jar because I like trying new products for my face....I was out of my last moisturizer and was placing an order through Amazon anyways. It had a bad smell to it but that was not the reason I had to toss it. It took a few weeks to realize that after I started using it, my face was breaking out in tiny pimples. I am 55 and had not had a pimple in 30 years. I stopped using it and the pimples stopped coming."
5,Wonderful product,I believe no matter what product you look up you'll never find a product everyone loves.I LOVE this face moisturizer. It's light and the smell doesn't bother me at all unlike some other reviewers.I like that it's lightweight and non greasy.My skin felt so soft after I put it on.I look forward to the long term effects on my skin.
1,Oily..made me break out in zits along with allergic issues,"I was looking for a daily moisturizer that would actually moisturize my face, so when I saw Hope in a Jar on QVC, I had to buy it. I have tried the product for two weeks now, and, all I have gotten is the same result. I have only put a pea-sized drop of this stuff on each and every night, and, when I wake up, I wake up to a cluster of blackheads and zits, usually on either my nose or my forehead. I am also very allergic to a lot of chemicals in beauty products, but this was the worst! I actually have to be put on steroids for 30 days because it is making my asthma and high IGE levels of allergies act up badly. Also, if you have oily skin, BEWARE. I don't have oily skin, and this made me break out in tons of zits, so, imagine what it would do to people that have really oily or oily skin! I am not saying that Hope in a Jar isn't good for everyone. All I know is, it's not good for me! It's Refund Time!!"
2,Not the same product I bought in store.,"I had purchased the original Hope in a Jar at my Ulta last year and loved it. It wasn't until now that I worked up the courage to spend a chunk of cash again for something that really hydrated and brightened my skin. Low and behold what I received in the mail was not at all what I bought in store. While it came in the beautiful Philosophy packaging, the product itself was goopy and runny (it spilled on me as I was trying to open it!); not at all the light, gel-like moisturizer I used to know. People harped on the smell which I remember being pleasant and fresh -- whatever was in this jar was a very strange, chemical type smell. Not at all pleasant. Thinking perhaps my memory wasn't what it used to be, I tested it out for a week. It slicked onto my skin, felt very slippery and moisturized my skin for a couple hours at best. Overall very disappointed. I'm going to try to return this because it isn't at all what I wanted, especially for the price."
3,No SPF,"I purchased this for my husband, but failed to notice that this one doesn't have the SPF. If you want SPF, pay attention to the label. I didn't and wish that I had."
1,Displeased with product!,"The consistency of the lotion looks like curdled milk. I don't know if it was stored properly, shipped properly or even if the product is truly authentic... I am disappointed!"
5,Great,I was looking all over for a good moisturizer for my dry skin and I found it with hope in a jar. Best thing is that it was sent to me so quickly!
3,Just OK,"I typically use Biore or Neutrogena skin care products, but the Sephora rep hooked me into buying a trial size of the Purity cleanser (which is great), Hope in a Jar moisturizer and the Help Me retinol treatment. I can't use the retinol since I am nursing, but I have been using the other two products a week and a half now. I do like the Purity cream cleanser because my face feels really fresh after I use it. I am on the fence about the Hope in a Jar. My main complaint is the ""wet dog"" smell. It does go on smoothly, but I haven't really noticed a big change in my complexion. I wish it had sunscreen in it too, like my fave Oil of Olay moisturizer. Bottom line: I plan to use up the rest of what I have and switch back to my old skin care regime."
1,Bad reaction,"I was very excited when I received a sample of this from sephora after hearing and reading about it for years. However, after two uses I had to toss this....I developed some sort of reaction that made my face and neck itchy and red. Never have had a reaction like this to skin cream."
2,Allergic Reaction & Rosacea,"So I purchased the small trial jar first..it worked out great...although it did give me some slight tingling feeling every time I put it on.Soon after, I bought the large jar for a big price! When I went in to see my Skin specialist a week after my small trial size was done...he told me I had rosacea!! I can't really use the product now coz it makes my rosacea so so bad! My face is all itchy and has tiny red patches again...! Have a bottle full and Don't know what to do with it...switching to Biotherm for now."
1,Bad Allergic Reaction,"I used this product for one day, and woke up this morning with my face hot and red, swelling and little bumps all over. My doctor advised me to go to an urgent care center -- they gave me prednisone to take. I wish I had read reviews before buying this. My face is so swollen and itchy I had to take a day out of work. I don't have extremely sensitive skin, and I don't know which ingredient caused the allergic reaction. If you are thinking about buying this product, get a sample first and do a test. My face feels like I rubbed poison ivy leaves all over it. :("
5,My wife loves it!,It's her favorite.The price is not too bad considering it last forever. :)And her beauty is important for me. ;)
5,Too kool for skool! Lol!,I wanted to try something new. So I decided on this mousterizer and the cleanser. I wasn't too excited to pay so much. After I received my order I'd have to say its worth it. I love that its not a thick heavy cream. Its slides on nice and thin and I don't have to put more on after 10 mins. My skin is no longer flaky dry. Its awesome! My face looks younger. I LOVE IT!
1,Not for Sensitive Skins-- Perfume is Unnecessary,"Not for Sensitive Skins-- Perfume is UnnecessaryWhy would a company put such a heavy perfume in a facial moisturizer? It seems that the majority of the negative reviews are because of the odor.I usually use Clinique, or Bare Minerals which is completely fragrance-free. Even then, I sometimes get reactions (usually to chemical sunscreens that are in a lot of day creams).This product is not a good choice for women who have sensitive skin. It didn't make me break out, because it actually burned and I had to take it off immediately. This product contains Diazolidinyl Urea which is irritating to a lot of people (including me).Conclusion: Lots of good reviews, so I guess it's worth a try, but skip it if you don't like perfumed moisturizers."
5,"Great, easy reading book that packs a punch.",Minasi's writing style is relaxed and fun. This comes about when someone has depth of knowledge on a particular subject and is comfortable with it. The book covers all the areas dealing with PC repair and goes into considerable detail on hard drives. Well worth the investment. Two gnarly thumbs up.
3,Annie - A Royal Adventure,Movie not what I expected ~ Well Pleased With selling merchant ~ Seller perfomance wsd great ~ A-1 !!!!!
3,Extra Annie Story Made for Molly,The sequel of Annie(1982) the motion picture based upon the long-running Broadway musical of the same title during late 70s became more like TV soap opera and has less element of musical the first of the Annie movie had. Yet the drama otherwise failed second attempt was saved by the new character Dr. Eon and Annie's little friend who was left behind Ms. Hanningan's house. Molly is cute and almost steals the show. And I am glad Camille Belle who played the part of Molly quite well has grown up well to play the lead part of WHEN A STRANGER CALL in 2006.Verdict: Enjoyable but lack action like the predesessor.Rating: 75 out of 100. Mixed bag but I like the character of Dr. Eon and Molly.Recommended for: Camille Belle fans and Annie fans.
4,"deep, heavy book but makes Kaz more understandable","We are adopting a baby from Kaz and wanted a little background on the country. This is not a light read by any means. It gives you a lot of info on the current Kaz president (and his corrupt ways), oil reserves and who's competing for them, ethnic struggles between the Russians and Kakahs, and the apathetic ways of the Kaz voters to name a few of the many topics it addresses. Get it for good background on a variety of important topics vital to Kaz's future success."
3,Okay Cleanser,"I have tried different cleansers and while this is not my favorite it is still good. At first I didn't like it and then I realized I was using it wrong -- not applying to dry skin. Once I got it right it did a fine job of removing makeup and and rejuvenating the skin. It is soap-free and gentle but I prefer a gel cleanser that can be used with water like Murad's Anti-redness cleanser, which is also gentle enough to remove eye makeup with very little rubbing. It doesn't have a luxurious feel at all, which I like. It's fine but for the price I wasn't overly impressed."
3,It's OK...,"I purchased this CD (my first Deftones CD) two weeks ago, after hearing Back to School, Be Quiet and Drive and Passenger. I have to say I was pretty dissapointed with it, the presentation of the CD was cool but the content on the CD is average, it certainly doesn't showcase Deftones at their best. Because of a crack on the cover, yesterday I took this back for a refund. The next Deftones CDs I plan to buy are ""Around the Fur"" and ""Deftones"", released on May 20th 2003. As for ""Back to School EP"", only buy it if you want to complete your 'Tones collection."
1,How many guesses do we get?,So what do we do guess what this is and how many guesses do we get? Would be nice if you lazy people would put down what this is get with it people!
4,Listen to it,"Nothing like the sound of a good trombone player and Delfeayo is just that. Elvin Jones is on the CD and sounds wonderful. I love the variety of sound. From Lonesone Warrior to the last cut, just wonderful. The mark for me is would I listen to it again and again, YES I would. I hope Delfeayo makes more and more music."
1,There are better books,"This book is not really that great. It is small and incomplete, the wrong size for taking into the field, and it doesn't hold up well(spine breaks and pages fall out). You are MUCH better off using an Audubon or Peterson guide. Save your money."
4,interesting angle,First time I've read anything that involved some of the history of Eygpt in a fiction story. I enjoyed reading it.
5,A brilliant offering of blissed-out magistry,Prior singles and compilation offerings did not prepare me for the full length debut of Asteroid #4. I was hooked from the get go and keep the cd in heavy rotation on my cd player. The first song to really hit me was the Admiral's Address. A magnificent song with a cool story line to boot. Any song that can evoke memories of the Star Force is A-OK with me. What is most impressive about this album is the broad range of songs on the album. There is something for everyone on this album yet the songs still retain a coherency as a whole. Some records have just a few good tracks that make the album great. This album hits on all accounts. Splendid. A sonic blanket that washes over the listener and transports them to a world of sonic loveliness.
3,Wonderful Content but Book Binding is Substandard,The information and photographs get a 5-star Rating. The binding (0 stars) fell apart the second time I opened the book.
5,classic album,"This is Suzi's first debut album its raw, it rocks, and its a great rock n roll album. After hearing the album tracks Chinn & Chinn then wrote Suzi's first single based on what they had heard, just as the singles where chart toppers the album tracks are just classic. This is the album that started it all for Suzi her raunchy leather image and good looks, laced with her ability to belt out a hard edge tunned paid off, people got to know who she was and the rest is history so they say,,, great work Suzi,,, defenately a classic album."
2,"runs like a freezer unit and sounds like it too, does not cool my CPU, only it'self.","I bought this one because my Quad RAID 0 arrey was failing on one of the controllers. my four raptors needed extra power. Now they are fine but the CPU overheats and the mobo exceeds temp of my previous P/S. The power is there but what a dumb design why the offset fans? This trend stinks. I preferr the belly suck fan or a tri fan system. Listed as ""having two fans"" is not enough. I assumed they all had belly fans for the second fan. not this one. Do NOT buy unless your Mobo is a weird configuration or something and your case has more than on rear fan. On last thing, I've had mine for only the better half of the week and the rear fan has already given up the goat. I'm returning this one."
2,Not as good as my Milwaukee 18V NiCads,"Tested on two new sets Milwaukee 18V NiCads and two sets of new Milwaukee 18V Li-Ions.Fully charge the Li-Ions and within a week its down one bar and within 6 months it's fully discharged. This does not happen on my Milwaukee NiCads, which has plenty of power after 6 months in storage. Further, the NiCad run time is 30% longer than the Li-Ions. Go figure, does not go with the amp-hours ratings, as run times should be much longer on the Li-Ions. Disappointed."
1,These batteries do NOT last more than a year,Very poor battery. I bought a combo-pack with these batteries and have had nothing but trouble.They won't hold a charge and Milwuakee's customer support is next to worthless.I am moving to another brand instead of wasting more money on poor quality batteries and horrible customer service.Other corded Milwuakee tools I've bought have been great. I would not buy another cordless Milwuakee tool again.
4,Easy to use,The book is written at a middle grade level. I appreciate that since a few of the older women in our group cannot read very well. We focus on the Apply aspect. I recommend this book to those who want to start a women's Bible study.
1,Huh?,"After slogging through this book, I just have to say, HUH? I mean, I get it, but I guess I just don't think it's nearly as good as everyone else seems to think. I found the writing choppy, and the references weak, at best.I was expecting something that would surprise me, and I was disappointed to find this mess of a book."
4,Can a small-town girl find happiness...,"Can a small-town girl find happiness with a man who sold her a haunted house? That's Candice Poarch's dilemma in her first novel, ""White Lightning."" Clarice Taylor is an elementary school teacher in a small Virginia town who begins to experience strange sights and sounds at the house she's bought from Tylan Chance. Thirty years ago, Tylan's uncle was murdered there. Some townsfolk say the house is haunted. Tylan and Clarice are drawn to each other. Tylan, feeling guilty because he sold Clarice a haunted house, offers to move in to protect her after the police come up empty-handed. (Never, ever, ever does Clarice suspect Tylan might have engineered this whole thing to move in with her. But that's the only spot where the reader has to suspend belief.) There is a town full of colorful characters that could have their own stories told. In the end, love conquers all and the mystery is solved."
1,Beware! Plastic NOT foam,"I ordered this item and liked them so much I made a second order. The second order came today and the hangers are CHEAP with plastic instead of foam like the first ones had. There is nothing friction about them. The plastic is slippery. The first order was from Containers and More, the second order was from Sell Below Cost. Do not order if it says coming from Sell Below Cost - you will not get what you think you are getting. I'm sending these back."
5,My closet loves me for this!,"These work fantastic and keep my closet nice and organized. I use them on all my pants, jeans, dress pants, etc. No problems what so ever."
1,It was like a long episode!,"Ok, first of all I thought personally that this ending movie was not what I hoped it would be. I hoped that Ataru were to kiss Lum and say he loved her. But this was not a good concluding ending to Urusei Yatsura! Though, I did like it a little. Ok, here is the entire unconcluding movie plot: Ok, Ataru at a festival meets a princess that carries a bazooka gun. Lum as you would expect, tries to stop him from going in the princess' UFO. Now she used Ataru to get a love potion for her, because she was in love with a tofu boy. But Lum wanted it to give to Ataru. So the way that the drinker of the potion falls in love is that the drinker falls in love with the first person they see. (A spoof of cupid's arrow huh?) This in my opinion is a movie to watch BEFORE the last episode."
1,Very few actual instructions. Useless,"If you are looking for a good source on what historic hairstyles look like, I recommend period photos or paintings. This book is supposed to be a how to guide on various hairstyles, but only gives actual instructions for a few styles. The rest might as well just say ""buy a wig"", because there is no attempt to show how the style can be achieved with the actor's own hair. A worthless waist of money."
1,Stereo Jack Too Small,"As with the comments on the Dayton 6 foot cable, the RCA-mini jack would not seat correctly in my laptop jack. Plugging it in would only get me one channel, pulling it out a bit would not ground the cable correctly (hum). While this did not work for me, Parts-Express' return service was awesome. Maybe it will work for others. Bought a M* Cable, worked perfectly but cost a bunch more."
3,"Deford's Best? Well, almost...","For anyone who enjoys Deford's witty, literate commentaries on sports and society-or those who haven't had the pleasure of reading his work-this book is a great introduction!I have to agree that Deford's best work is found in his longer magazine articles. His work for 'Sports Illustrated' alone could fill a few volumes, and the best pieces in this volume are those 'SI' stories already mentioned by other reviewers. Personally, I would have preferred more articles and fewer NPR essays. The shorter, 'intended for broadcast' commentaries are sort of a 'Reader's Digest Condensed' version of Deford's wit and wisdom-tantalizing glimpses that leave the reader wishing he had more room to elaborate!I especially recommend ""When There Were Still Elusive Barriers""(about Bannister and Hillary), and ""Got to Do Some Coachin'"" (the brilliant play that encapsulizes the turbulent personal life of Arkansas basketball coach Nolan Richardson)."
3,"DeFord, ""I'm Just Getting Started""","DeFord continues to offer fresh looks at sports on his weekly NPR feature. In this collection of essays, he reveals himself as a fine writer, as well as an outspoken observer of the sport scene. The selection presented here should have something of interest for fans of every sport. It covers the entire field. I am completely satisfied with this book; but I am in my 80s. I give it a satisfactory rating--rather than outstanding--because it is pretty dated. The topics and athletes it covers may not mean as much to the reader who is under 50. It really would sell better in a mass market edition."
3,very thin,I thought this would be the exact same as the blade that came with my saw but it is very thin; maybe 50% and bends quite easily. Otherwise its very sharp and cuts well.
2,"Service prompt, item not in good condition","The item was shipped promptly but had been billed as ""like new"". The inside of book was indeed like new but both the front and back binding were totally broken. I elected to mend them rather than go thru hassle of returning for a replacement. I probably should have contacted seller but since the price was so low, I figure I got what I paid for."
4,Good Read! !,"This book took a little longer than her other books did to grab my total attention--I was at the middle of the story before the main character even really entered the scene in a meaningful way. But the last half of the book more than made up for the long and suspenseful climb.Her ethos changed a lot in this book--it was interesting to see the differences in writing style since her last book. If you are expecting the same sort of writing style as her older books, be ready to see the differences in Beautiful Child.I related to many of her sticky situations, and anyone who cares about and works with children will find a lot to identify with in this story. I laughed a lot more than I did while reading her other books. Torey's sense of humor shines. Read the book, it's great stuff!"
3,"Pretty Good, but enough organizers are included","These are great organizers for a good price that can fit on many different size closet rails. I was disappointed that they included stickers that went through toddler sizes, but not enough dividers to use all of the stickers. I will be ordering an additional set."
5,Psychological Thriller!,I was impressed by the imagination of the author. The wallpaper as a metaphorical imprisonment is unique.Why isn't this short story more recognized? I'm glad I don't have wall paper in my house or I might find my imagination running away with me!
4,Creepy in a good way!,"A sort of creepy book in which the protagonist creeps all over. Ha ha! You have to read the story to understand what I mean.The story is told from the depths of mental illness- clear, vivid, amusing, disheartening and striking! I loved the conceptualization and description of the story.A little read but it makes you think for hours after. The language is beautiful and there is so much show rather than tell in the writing that I could see clear visuals of the happenings.You must read this one for the sake of having a glimpse into madness (and I don't say that in any bad way. Equivalent to mental illness, a crude term)."
3,Not the version I need.,This is not the version I need for my class. But anyway its quality is okay. And it's very thin.
2,"like the wallpaper, a bit of a yawn","This story, while not without value, is overly long and doesn't quite live up to the denouement. It may simply be my modern tastes are just too jaded for the story, but not much of a thriller here."
5,Really nice suit.,"Nothing to do with those cheap copies at 80 bucks. A bit expensive thoughGreat quality built.Boots cover have really nice ringing bells attached.Pants are a bit big, Used them with a pillow fillable Santa belly and fitted nice.For the price, real boots would have made this a great deal."
4,This guy knows......,"There are two major camps in stock picking clubs, the ""buy and hold"" and ""market timing camp"". And I don't think people in one camp ever care to talk to the other group. So make up you mind which group you are going to join! Once there, you got to stick to your group!!!!WJ O'Neil perhaps is the most knowledgable, or at least most out spoken person in the market timing camp to-day, the great ones have passed away long ago.First time readers may not be impressed, I didn't, as this book is really poorly written and uninspirational. You may have to take my words for it, this guy knows a lot!!!The truly great books in market timing are all very old, or should I say classic? I suggest you buy all the classics written by Ed Lefevre; Jesse Livermore; Richard D Wyckoff...."
2,How to Make Money in the Past,"This book have good reasons to subscribe to his newspaper, but when applied to the stock market- it doesn't come close. He lacks the fundamental and technical analysis that his competitors explain in their books.The Founder of IBD keeps on trying to give you a sales pitch for his newspaper in almost every single page of the book. This is the only book that I've read that tries to make you buy additional resources from them.Overall- This book is nothing, but a big sales pitch for his newspaper.Rating: Hold"
4,Sound Advice,"The book offers a clear system for stock selection and disposal. It is indeed a fascinating read. However, it contains too much information to allow the read to remember and apply all of it.There are other successful investing systems. The key is to apply the appropriate system to a particular stock.""How to Make Money in Stocks"" does offer stellar warnings. One must be highly disciplined to succeed. One must let the market dictate when to buy and sell. One needs to ignore wishful thinking and sentimentality. These warnings apply to all systems of investing and trading, and therefore the prerequisite in implementing any system."
3,"Good system, but skip the promo piece","Most of the book was very useful. A good discussion of how and why stocks move. (Though I can't comment about the investment results yet.) I could have done without the 20 page chapter promoting Investors' Business Daily. Throughout the book, O'Neil shamelessly promotes himself as a source of information, but almost all of the numbers you need are available on the Internet for free. Self-promotion and ignorance of the Internet are the reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4."
3,"Same OLD,Same OLD","The book is a good beginners book to the market. O'Neil has some strong ideas, but they are very general when it comes to explanation. The technical side of his analysis is using simple chart formations, like Cups, and base building, which do not go into enough detail, or explanation to get a strong understanding. Of course I believe that this book leads to many other books, and in that respect it is a gem. It list solid books, that have taught me a ton about the market in general.I think the one thing that O'Neil should have mentioned is that this is his investment technique, and that everyone should find what they are really comfortable with. You cannot use someone elses and be successfull, because you have to truly understand yourself, before playing the market. But all in all, read this book, think about his ideas, and learn something, it will definantly payoff in the longrun."
4,Naysaying the naysayers,"I found the book not only to be a relatively easy read, but able to hold my attention. One of the best parts about it is how Mr. O'Neil debunks some of our myths and misconceptions about investing (such as cutting our losses) with analogies from everyday life. I subscribed to IBD for a couple of months before reading the book, and the book made my subscription much more worth it. While I will certainly make mistakes and take losses down the road, I improved my portfolio by four percent in the three weeks after I started applying his methods. If you don't like the book, you probably haven't given it a try."
1,How to LOSE money in stocks!,"The popularity of books like this one explains why so many people lose so much money in the stock market.The book puts too much emphasis on the most useless techniques of technical analysis. The use of chart patterns that O'neil loves is closer to astrology than finance.The book talks about fundamentals (earnings, growth, etc), but in a very limited way. Using fundamentals according to O'neils way can easily make you lose your money!A much better book on growth investing is ""The Little Book That Makes You Rich"". A good book on technical analysis is ""How Technical Analysis Works"". I also recommend reading ""Evidence Based Technical Analysis"" which shows how limitd technical analysis is."
5,A superb collection!,"By the way, this Penguin book has the COMPLETE text of ""In Memoriam."" The Everyman's edition does not."
3,Not their best compilation . . .,"While the tracks are good, there are far better compilations to be baught by the listener. Take Sleepless for example. The tracks in Absent Lovers are wonderful, but the live versions add a bit of harshness to the ear."
3,Memories,Mainly got the book because I got it as a teenager and it was also a book I purchased in Germany under a different author's name. Considered fairly racy (old word) for its time. Story was actually better than I remembered. Probably a better nostalgic purchase than anything else.
5,Wonderful book,"This a truly great book that everyone should read. Now to my experience with getting. I was looking for a reasonably priced hard back edition. This one said very good condition, in a price range I could live with. When I got the book I was happy with the condition until I found a bar code on the back cover which tore the cover getting it off. They should have specified that there was this sticker on the back cover. I like to keep my books and that is why I buy hard back. I was disappointed. Not only that but there was a sticker on side that read salvation army, $2.99. I really didn't care about the price difference but it showed me lack of concern by the seller which I do not appreciate. ruscolombo"
5,Earth Abides reveals our own fragile links to civilization.,"I read the Earth Abides, after listening to a friend describe this story as one of the most impactful he had ever known. Several years later in the early 1980's, I stumbled across a slightly used copy in a bookstore. George Stewart tells a fascinating tale of a post apocolyptic vision staged in the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay area. This story has stayed with me and endures as a valued set of images. The struggle to make sense of the horrific and nonsensical was intuitively accurate. The story revealed in human terms the everyday efforts of a small group of survivors, suddenly stranded and adrift. The beneficiaries of a hulking but hollow industrial infrastructure that no longer served those who remained and their succeeding generations. The unfolding ""descent"" of industriatized society as well as the marginalization of technology was at once fascinating and frightening. The ending left me stunned, yet wisened."
4,Earth Abides 1949,"Plot Kernel - A deadly virus has nearly annihilated the human race, leaving all other life untouched. Civilization has ended. A survivor searches for others and eventually joins with a woman who lost her family in the epidemic. In time, he becomes the leader of a few families who have intermarried and who together live off the abundant supply source of the otherwise uninhabited city."
3,"Memorable, but flawed","I read this book when I was in middle school, probably 1982, and it's impressive that it seemed futuristic even at that time when it had been written decades earlier. With the imminent release of ""I Am Legend"" I was reminded of this book again as a different take on post-apocalyptic literature.I said it was memorable but flawed because it gave an interesting early look at the idea of a pandemic, and the aftermath of such, but didn't seem to give a realistic take on the survivors' civilization. Why would people suddenly give up their institutes of religion, for example? Historically, when has this happened? He has black people in the south growing cotton ""just because"" and worshipping crocodiles (I don't know if this was a racist component or not.)In the end, his view was rather too cynical and unrealistic about the way people react to the loss of technology. Technology isn't what makes people great, it is their values. I think he didn't realize that."
3,"Unrealistic beginning, but grows on you somewhat",Overall this book didn't impress me enough to ever recommend it to anyone else but it also wasn't horrible. The beginning explanation of the plague and the prehistory of the character are so vague that the rest of the book is ruined. Doesn't stand anywhere near books like The Stand or Swan Song.
2,The main character ruined the book.,"I know this book was first published in 1949. I can overlook the unlimited shelf life of canned goods and gasoline. It's the main character ""Ish"" who ruined this story for me. He is your typical elitist douche bag who confuses a large vocabulary with intelligence. With a university library at his fingertips, this mental giant could not learn the basics of survival (agriculture, animal husbandry, auto repair, food storage etc...)in his lifetime! I muscled through the book hoping it would redeem it's self in the end, but I ended up losing eight bucks on my kindle and three days of my life. If you want to read this ""classic"" be prepared for constant complaining about the stupidity of others while doing absolutely nothing to better the situation. Hubris abounds with his superior attitude and god complex. He's also a bit of a racist (Not for his use of the word ""Negro"", but for his temptation to use the black people he encounters to make himself king!) and a sexist."
2,Earth Abides review,"I've read many of the ""apocalyptic"" books. This was a quiet one. Since it was written in 1949, that might explain that. It was a pleasure not to see the F-word at all, and so many of the other obligatory modern slang phrases. It did avoid any positive reference to religion, so it is ""modern"" in that respect. Not exciting at all, and somewhat sad. Probably would appeal to women and those who consider themselves as intellectual or literary critics. Me, I just wanted some action from this book--not."
2,Bland and unrealistic,"Having skimmed the other reviews, it seems that one had to read this book as a young person and use those glowing memories to enjoy it. Since I approached the book fresh, the flaws are glaring.The main character, Ish, is pretty dull. There isn't much dialogue in the book, so most speech is communicated through his hearing others and describing what they meant. Since he's not particularly insightful, reading is slow and the pages creep by.Civilization seems completely lost despite the fact that books, machines, etc. remain intact. Ish rules The Tribe, who are a step or so above a Neanderthal group. They even walk from place to place like hunter-gathers. How about using the million and one bicycles laying around if you can't figure out how to get gas for a car?The book is not poorly written, just improbable and boring."
2,losing impetus,"The start of this novel was magical for me - so engrossing and so convincing. But then it descends into the comfortable and the suburban. Is this the fate of all human communities? More disappointing was the ugliness of some decisions made by the community - and for me these were far from inevitable or even justifiable. These were presaged on p132 of the SF Masterworks edition - '... except for Evie, the half-witted one, who should never be allowed to have children.' How attitudes have changed since 1949 when this book was written!"
4,Earth Abides,"I read Earth Abides the first time over 35 years ago. It is one of the few books that genuinely presents an ""end of civilization"" as we know it and does it well without a lot of fanfare. This is a discriptive story that I plan to read again."
2,"sorry, but i found it boring","Perhaps because I've read several recently published books that deal with life after ""the end of the world as we know it,"" I found this book to be slow moving and even boring at times. However, I enjoyed moments of nostalgia when presented with phrases like ""tourist court"" and ""I pressed the starter button on the car."" Brought back memories. Sadly, the world as we knew it then has already ended."
1,Long & BORING,"Not really SiFi. Fiction and Apocalyptic yes, but after a very few chapters to grab your interest, author drifts off into non-related daydreaming, repetition and his personal philosophy on various character's lives. I'm betting that he was a self proclaimed authority and certainly a pipe smoker.No science, little innovation, but it goes on and on. You keep hoping it will get better, but unfortunately, it doesn't. How it won any award remains a mystery to me. If you are looking for an exciting science fiction work, sorry, but this isn't it."
1,Would like my money back,"My hobby is reading . I enjoy reading stories. all kinds of stories by bestselling authors or never heard of authors. always looking for a good story. In my search I have read some great stories, some not so great and just plain awful. but only three times have I ever disliked a story where I could not finish it. This story was so bad not only could I not finish it I would like a refund. the story line could of been interesting. The writing was horrible. I hope it is a long time before I come across a book this bad again."
3,first funkpunkrapmetal,"ok i think we can safely say that this should be the first documentation of the fusion of punk,funk,rock,rap and metal right?if any one can think of anything that came before please write in i would like to know.we could say it was run dmc or the beasties licensed to ill but those guys used drum machines and were way more rap than anything else.the most amazing thing is this album can hold up against any thing that came after including later chilipepper albums and is way kooler than limp biscuit and kid rock!old school rules!"
5,"Wonderful book, beautifully illustrated",This is the classic written by the inventor of the retropubic simple prostatectomy. I feel lucky to be the owner of this book.
5,They are amazing!,"I had never bought any Fruit of the Loom tees and once I received them I thought they were going to be torn so quickly because they are so light but the real point is that I still have them intact and I've used them for work everyday since I bought them, that's amazing! I'd buy them again.Thanks."
2,"Looks great the first time, but a wrinkled mess thereafter","I was happy with the first go around with these, but after 1 wash they became a wrinkled mess. That wouldn't be a big deal, but the collar was all folded and looked terrible. I'm on the hunt for a new brand..."
2,Buy these at target or rite aid,Just remember that t shirts like these shrink. I'm lazy when it comes to shopping but next time I'll carry my butt to the store. Shrinkage is awful. Order a size up please esp if your man has a gut or is tall. Too much shrinkage for me. Waste of money and time.
2,Very thin -- not so impressive,"I wear undershirts nearly every workday, so I've gone through quite a bit. I have purchase Fruit of the Loom a few times at my local Wal-Mart or Target, and they serve me well enough for the small amount I spend on them.I found them on Amazon on a great Buy One Get One Free deal. I always need undershirts, so I tought, ""why not?""Well, I love a great bargain, but you get what you pay for. I have compared these to the Hanes shirts in my undershirt collection, and I have noticed that the Fruit of the Loom variety seems remarkably thinner and wears out considerably faster. I also notice they get that dingy, dull ""worn"" look much faster than other undershirts I've worn in the past.Pass this one by."
4,Dog supplement,"My Shiba Inu was always scratching himself -- even using a conditioner after baths, his skin would flake -- the vet recommended that I give him a supplement with fatty acids -- after reading the comments on the different supplements, I decided to try the Dermatrix -- after a week, I already felt a difference when I brushed his flanks -- his breath was a little fishy for the first two weeks but that cleared up -- the only down side is how expensive this product is!"
2,overwrought and underdone,a weak attempt at an introductory text...in trying to simplify the subject too much meat has been pared from the bones...the result is a sometimes confusing and often plainly erroneous text...spend the extra seven bucks and get either stallings or tanenbaum...if you buy this book I hope it is for a wedding gift to a couple you do not like...
4,Good short story collection,Great read for those interested in Ghanaian culture and life. Very insightful for those of us children born to Ghanaian parents in the States on what Ghana life and culture is like.
4,"Great and lots of stickers, bad camera","After reading the reviews I was aware of the camera issues, still, I got it for my 8 year old niece because this set has tons of stickers. She loves it but was disappointed that the camera didn't work like it should."
3,Great if you can get it.,"This item is great to have. Straight from the 300 movie, awesome for a shelf. But don't order with Nocal gifts, if you do this item will never ship to you."
5,Invaluable reference,"I really enjoyed this thoroughly researched biography, hearing from Wolf's family, fellow musicians and fans, but I especially liked the detail about his recorded legacy. As the life proceeds, the reader is told who Wolf is playing with at each stage of his career. Once he began recording, the reader is given plenty of context about the most significant recordings. Music and blues fans can learn who played on what session, who produced and for what company and under what circumstances. The book has an index so it's easy to find information on specific tracks that fit the music into the larger context of the life and the times. A terrific read about a man born on a plantation who lived into the 70s and who toured the world with his unique and powerful talent. It's also a reference work for those who'd like to know whether Hubert Sumlin or Willie Johnson is playing guitar at a particular junction in Howlin' Wolf's life. A real contribution."
2,Too Much and Yet Too Little,"I am sure that Howlin' Wolf's story is a great one, but it is not told well in this book. The author spends more time listing every single bluesman he has every seen or heard of. The author is more concerned with showing off his knowledge of blues than telling Wolf's story."
4,A beautiful story,"and it distresses me that someone wrote an inaccurate review of it. This book has nothing to do with Eleanor of Acquitane or her court.Instead it begins in the 1300s with Melisande who comes over from France, bringing the Saracen Lamp, considered to be the house's greatest treasure, which is stolen by Alys in the Elizabethan age. Perdita is the one to bring back the life of the house.The characters are well-written and Ruth M. Arthur was very good at providing atmospheric scenes, imbuing nature and buildings with a sense of human-like presence."
1,Quite a disappointment,"When left at room temperature on the kitchen table the indoor temperature reading was about 4 degrees higher than the outdoor temperature. (I expected both readings to be the same.) Once installed in accordance with the instructions, the outdoor temperature reading stays about 10 degrees higher than readings on other thermometers placed along side the sensor. In addition, the thin strip of liquid in both glass tubes make it difficult to read the temperatures. Bottom line: I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Drowning in the Richness of Junot Diaz,"This story collection started off a little choppy;the best stories are at the end. The authoremploys a stream of consciousness that remindsyou of Toni Morrison.The characters' evolution as young adolescent teenageboys is juxtaposed with Diaz's linear narration thatrecalls the immigrant's life with desperation. Timeis not an issue in Diaz's work; the characters moveat their own paces and learn about life in their ownways.Though the machismo is a bit stifling at times, Diazis a gifted writer whom readers can expect many greatthings from in the future."
3,"A good book, just not for me.","His collection of short stories is a good read. While I personally am not a fan of this book, that in no way means others won't be. I enjoyed reading the Spanish in the writing (mostly because I understand Spanish and enjoy the change)and admired his writing skill in general. He definitely has a talent for writing. The stories in this collection are great short story models and it demonstrates how short stories can all come together to tell a larger story. His other work may be more interesting for me but this I wouldn't read again."
4,A fascinating contrast of life in DR and the U.S.,"This book offers a captivating glimpse into the transitional life of a Dominican family's experiences as it struggles to adapt to social, cultural, economic, and domestic mishaps. The author does a great job in capturing the reader's interest page after page. A must read."
1,Stereotypes! Latinos in a Box!,"Its very easy to write a book where all the characters are stereotypes or have no positive qualities. To ""Drown"" the reader in a story that really is not credible nor really reflects the urban experience is completely irresponsible. Just like ""Soul on Ice"" or ""Monster"" this writer uses ""sensationalism"" and the erotic lure of the ""Latino"" culture, to get critics raving for his lack luster material. This book is highly offensive to anyone who is familiar with Latino literature or the Urban experience. The writer should have been more responsible for the book's content and its characters, who are only imaginary reflections of the Dominican/Puerto Rican/Latino experience in America. Its one thing to observe life in the Barrio, it's another to actually write about it with respect and honesty. The writing is terrible and the characters come out of a comic book. I give this book a thumbs down for its writing, depiction of characters, and flow!"
3,Lyrical. . .,"This book has been described as a collection of stories, but it's more like a fragmented novel, all recounting the experiences of the narrator in the Dominican Republic and then New Jersey. It's extremely easy to read -- by easy I mean the prose flows effortlessly and lyrically and naturally. This beautiful quality diminishes somewhat towards the end, however. The stories are sad and harsh as stories of poor immigrants often are. But I read it for the prose which has the spareness and the originality of detail of poetry."
3,"Evocative, provocative, and...","...quite the opposite of uplifting (downlifting?). Junot Diaz is a masterful writer. This set of stories etches spare but potent images into the mind, and I will remember several passages for years to come. Yet, it would be difficult for me to fully recommend this book, as in, ""I loved it and you must read it."" I had chosen it for our book club to read, and we all came away feeling similarly--well-written and transformative, but don't read it when you're depressed. One fellow book club member did remark that you could read it when you're feeling down about yourself and realize that you actually have it okay compared to the protagonist. I'm glad I read it, and now want to read more by Diaz, such as the Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao."
3,Delivery Good - Part didn't fit,"Processing, tracking, delivery was all good and as promised. The part that the website matched to my year-make-model was not a match - I didn't have the luxury of returning it so I modified it as a temporary solution while I find the correct hose."
5,top notch collection,"this book edited by a leader in developing measures of mindfulness, brings together various leaders in applied mindfulness. the chapters are well written and present the empirical evidence for a particular intervention. even better, rich case material shows the actual clinical application. a very helpful book for both clinicians and researchers."
2,An academic demographic analysis of the French Canadians,"This is not a fascinating historical narrative of the early 17th century French Canadian pioneers. Rather it is a detailed and technical demographic analysis of the core population of about 3,380 French settlers of the St. Lawrence Valley prior to 1680.As stated on the dustjacket ""[this book] is of interest for students of Canadian, family, demographic, and migration history, as well as population genetics and several areas of sociology.""The book is densely populated with charts, graphs and tables with titles such as ""Relative Importance of the Pioneers in Genetic Endowment of French-speaking Population of Quebec"" and ""Distribution of Single Male Immigrant Arrivals and Female Entries in Marriage Market before 1663, by 5-Year Period"".It is a dry treatise not particularly inviting or entertaining to the casual lay reader."
1,Missing Pages,"I ordered Sweet Fire through them used, thinking I would get the entire book...It was missing the first 18 pages....Do they not check their products before before they ship them?"
2,Do We Really Need A Book About a Junkie?,"I read the reviews of this book and bought it out of curiosity because I am interested in women's issues. This book is NOT about women's issues. It's about a street corner variety junkie/prostitute/sociopath. It does nothing to enlighten the reader about the causes of such behavior. Rather, it glorifies social behavior which should be quashed.The prose borders on the mawkish, though there are some brilliant passages.The vividness of some scenes and the authority of the voice leads me to believe that the author writes from at least some experience. If this is the case, she is to be pitied."
2,Poppycock!,"If your mother has not taught you to wash and dress semi-decently, then shame on her! This book will get the slobs to freshen up and thank heavens for that but it will do little more."
2,OK but somewhat boring read!,"OK..not a bad book,but we read it in class.and its not a book we wanted to keep on reading and reading and reading,i mean some of the chapters are good but the rest are extremely boring..i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone,if u want a great read read orson scott card or george orwell books not these."
1,Tacky and Hypocritical,"In which our heroines put down a scantily clad woman, even though Destiny's Child are known for wearing skimpy outfits themselves. But if you were to remove the hypocritical lyrics, you're still stuck with a generic beat that sounds like something we've heard on a zillion other records. I actually like Destiny's Child, but I wasn't feelin' this one at all."
2,"Beautifully shot, but very unrealistic","We are expected to believe that the two 18-year-old hotties who lead this film live willingly in this fantasy trailer park somewhere in New Mexico, often lolling in a hot tub where they hold deep conversations. No one appears ever to do anything to earn any money except one works as a cashier in a convenience store where everyone buys things often. There's a silly teenage love story here, replete with a long-term fatal illness involved. If there ever was a place like Dreamland, I'd want to live there and never leave, too. Of course, one of the teenage goddesses is portrayed as a literary genius while her alcoholic love-sick dad can't manage to leave the couch as he moons over his dead wife. I enjoyed the soundtrack, which has a nice tune by Mazzy Star. You don't hear that very often in the movies."
4,He's the man,"Jaylin is up to is usually tricks in this one, but it seems that his women have finally somewhat come to their senses. Nokea seems to have partially moved on with Collins, but she will always love Jaylin no matter what he puts her through. Scorpio always seemed like a super confident woman, but it seemed like over time Jaylin wore her down just like he did to everyone else. She really took the time to get herself together and you can't help but be proud of her for that. Although Jaylin is definitely a low down dirty dog, you can't help but give him his props because he is 100% honest with everyone. I just wish the man would use some darn condom's! He is lucky he has only caught gonorrhea in the first book and nothing more serious. Now enter Dashia....I hope she doesn't add to much more drama to the mix because lord knows they can all use a break from the b-s. This series is certainly entertaining so far, so on to the next one!"
4,Uakti with singers,"Great songs and arrangements as always. A couple of songs are repeated from earlier Uakti recordings, most are new. Singers on many of the tracks."
3,a good game but..........,"ive played the 1st and 2nd dead or alive. so when i saw DOA4, i had to pick it up. the good part is the fighting and action is still awesome. the fighters are still hot! (the female fighters). plenty of costumes to unlock. and has good extra features that any DOA fan would like,plus it looks great in HD. the bad part about this game is the final battle with the hitomi prototype. is WAAAY too difficult to beat. i couldnt get a hit in before she took half or all my health with only 2 or 3 hits. thats just unfair. it makesyou not want to play because you keep losing. al in all, its an ok game. i would recommend you buy it used, goes for under 12 bucks."
5,"Almost as good as BSSM, and a lot more energetic","This album was the last truly great hoorah for the Chilis of the 80's and of that decade itself (a decade they owned underground), until they decided to crash the 1990's and bookmark that decade with two slower, more patient, and more realized albums. This album is pure funk and pure energy...something to not only bang your head to, but also something that makes you want to get naked and jump into a pool while ingesting massive amounts of sugar."
4,loved it,"the old funk of chili peppers untill these rereleases i was unable to find, and i thank EMI for rerealeases. these are fun to listen to, i recommend Magic Johnson and Punk Rock Classic and Pritty Little Ditty."
3,Early RHCP works,"This definitely did not suit my style and this being an early Red Hot Chili Peppers album blended punk, rap and metal together and every song except 'Knock Me Down' sounded like a mish-mash of sounds rather than music. Maybe its because of my leanings toward rock that I feel this way.The Later works of the RHCP's like Californication sounded much better than this."
3,I expected more from the vinyl,"Stadium Arcadium & Californication received significant vinyl upgrades from Steve Hoffman's 4 LP SA set & Chris Bellman's 2 LP Cali sets respectively. Both albums finally breathed and let's face it: sounded listenable. The original CD of Mother's Milk (not remaster) sounds fine (I haven't heard the original vinyl), so I hoped this vinyl might also be an improvement. Meh! I wish Kevin Gray, Hoffman or Bellman got his hands on this one. The vinyl sounds veiled (I haven't put it through a Spin Clean yet though)and has much sibilance. It's silent...too bad, because I'd likely send it back if it wasn't!"
5,Christmas gift,Book arrived safely and in condition advertised. Will be a Christmas gift so no other feedback available at this time.
4,Great product!,"I bought this for a elderly client to keep her organized and she loves it, I will be buying 2 more for me and the therapists want some too."
3,Cheap,"The fabric is very cheap, reminds me of cheesecloth material. I will probably sew a better fabric and bottom straps to hold my stuff. I am debating on whether to keep it. Not worth the cost."
5,Outstanding book on trading,"This book was awesome. So good in fact I am halfway through it a second time. LOTS of great useful information to help one succeed in trading.Dr. Elder lays out a plan to enter, pick a target, and exit a trade successfully.With every single trade he teaches in detail how to stay disciplined and organized.I highly recommend it."
5,Best book on the topic,I found this book along with Marcel Link's 'High probability trading' the best of dozens of books I've bought on the topic recently. Although it's not only a technical analysis book the part on technical analysis is more clearly written than most books dedicated to TA. The behavour of market is explained through trader's psychology and backed up with real life comparisions.
4,I knew something like this had to exist!,"We do cat, dog and rabbit rescue. So our nice stuff needs to be up and held securely in place. I finally found a review of quake hold in a magazine at the Dr.'s office. Went to my favorite site to shop - Amazon and there it was. Works great! Nothing afixed has budged. The stuff cleans up just fine. I'm pulling stuff out of storage to put back on pot shelves. Some of the stuff I forgot we even had. Thanks for letting us put out our breakables without worries of curious kitties knocking them off the shelf for puppies to maul. AM Rea"
3,Not Worth The Price,"After reading all the reviews, I forked out the money for this dryer with diffuser. Should have known better. It does not dry my hair any faster or smoother or better in any way than my cheap model from WalMart. More expensive doesn't mean better."
4,Helps to better understand metaphors,"Still, we need a more concise dictionary explaining more commonly used phrases. Nevertheless did manage to use this on various writing projects."
1,Read Marjorie Garber instead,"Has the thinking in any book ever been more thoroughly demolished than this one has been by Marjorie Garber in her ""Use and Abuse of Literature""? Read hers instead of this."
2,Nothing like the old ones,"Wilfrido had his great time, and the songs in this cd don't represent that time."
3,Original and weird.,"Pretty good, too. Basically, the CD starts off on an excellent foot, but then it gets all-samey by song five. But, it's never really boring or bad. Not a must-have in my book, but certainly more than a novelty. Doo Rag's got soul."
5,BEST GUN EVER!!!!!!!,I own about 6 guns this is by far the best gun i have ever owned me and all my friends air soft at night and this gun is great for CQB and long range. if your a beginner this is great for you if you air soft still a great gun. Bottom Line MUST BUY
2,pretty crappy,the scope is totaly off from where it should be aiming and thats not ok cuse when yur getting shot at from all flanks you dont want to have to compesate for some crappy manufacturing.and if you are outside you cant even see it half the timepiece of crap is still a scope and when you dont have iron site so you still have a general idea where youre gonna shootsave some money for a good scope.oh and by the way like picanny and weaver rail and ris stystem and all that crap is the same so buy whatever kind of scope you like and dont be scared for it not fitting
3,Don't be fooled by this Collection!,This two cd set is just 2 albums by Canned Heat (Cookbook and Friends in the Can) stuck together in another box to make it look like new songs--the songs listed on the back of the box are incorrect--nothing new here--if you already have these two albums (Cookbook and Friends in the Can) do not get this--it is the same CDs in their separate cases and sleeves stuffed into a bigger box. Of course if you do not have these two albums--than buy it!!!!!
3,Not the best of Ukridge,"No, these 10 stories are definitely not the cream of the Ukridge catalogue. In fact, you would probably not be far off in describing them as the worst (or least good) of the lot. In my opinion the later stories are much better. These were the very first 10 Ukridge short stories ever written, and they are markedly inferior to Plum's later efforts (where, incidentally, the stories are related by Ukridge himself; not by ""Corky"", who is less funny as a narrator).The 3 stars are because, well, it's still Plum."
3,ee,I like the story line that I could follow and probably would have given it a better rating had the dvd not been defective. It skipped at places so I missed portions of the movie
2,A faint interest,"This was a historical fiction book about the Civil War. Most of the places mentioned in the book were right here in North Carolina. Asheville, Statesville, Blowing Rock and Raleigh were mentioned several times. Even Charlotte was mentioned towards the end. I really tried to enjoy this book but after I finished it, I felt really let down. I am not sure if I was reading a history book or a sad attempt to weave some fiction with non-fiction. This book just did not capture my interest. My ears perked up when I read the story of the Blalocks. There were parts of their story that was interesting. I kept waiting for an exciting climax, but it never came. The ending was suppose to pull everything together but I am still sitting her trying to figure it out. For the most part, this book bored me. I thought, I would have enjoyed this more if you took out the fiction and just reported the history. At least I would have felt satisified that I learned something."
4,Interesting music from a lesser known Composer,"Another great performance from Jean-Francois Heisser. As I've said before, he deserves far more recognition as a superb pianist. These pieces by a lesser known composer are therefore appropriate for him to play. The ""Cancons i danses"" are salon like in style; somewhat similar to the music of Erik Satie. They are lyrical and create a mood which is relaxing and reflective. Mompou is best known for his ""Suburbis"" which is also played well here. The ""Cants Magics"" is a bit more moody and again, beautifully played. If you are interested in discovering new solo piano music played brilliantly, this is a CD worth exploring."
2,Disappointing,I had heard lots of stuff about this band and so ordered this from the States. Waste of my money. Sorry.
2,Too Small - Should be a small,"The gloves are OK. Me being a 6'0"" 15 year old male these gloves are too small. I could barely put them on. Also the material feels funny and takes a lot of getting used to.I would recommend them though if you are going to replace your CPU, GPU, etc."
5,Buddhist or not...,"...this book contains timeless of stories of universal values. The stories will be familiar to all, and they resonate with children. Sure, they could read another mass-market product promoting book, or they can read something of substance with lessons and an ethical/moral framework that is entertaining yet still not preachy."
3,Ok but more appropriate for millionairs,"The basic concept of planning on using your mature talents to benefit others is good. However, the personal examples of of a man worth hundreds of millions of dollars and his friends are hardly energizing for most readers."
1,Toilet Tissue,"Mayne dont noboby in da ATL listen 2 dis bull$*@!, only out of towners dat listen to old 3-6.Dis ning is a square. He should rap a lot better seein how dont nobody hear from him till his tapes drop. Don't buy dis %^#$. Get a case of beer or sum'n, u gon feel better!!!"
2,grade school History,"Grade school history, more legend than fact. Example: He tells the Nazi school boy legend of how Hitler won his Iron cross instead of the less exciting true story."
3,Pretty rug... but the wrong one!,"I ordered the 5x8 size and the picture is a tan and red pattern. Well, that is not the rug that came. I got the rug that is pictured by clicking on the 2x8 button. It is still a pretty rug, but the picture is wrong."
5,What a book!!,"I am a fan of Elinor's from the Father Knows Best days and am always thrilled to see her on TV or in movies. Reading this book I found out how little I knew about Elinor and her career. It was fascinating reading, I had no idea she had worked with so many great actors and had started in the business at such a young age. Haven't tried the receipes yet but they look really good too!"
2,INTHE KITCHEN WITH ELEANOR.,THIS A VERY INTERESTING BILOGRAPHY REGARDING A WELL KNOWN ACTRESS.THESE RECIPES THOUGH SEEM A LITTLE OUT DATE IM NOT SURE IF SOME OF THEM ARE EDIABLE.THIS IS CERTAINITY NOT YOUR AVERAGE COOK BOOK. YOU WOULD PURCHASE THIS BOOK MORE FOR A NOVELTY THEN FOR A READ OF ANY SORT.
2,Projects are vague at best,"I was expecting a detailed book with informative plans to build the projects in this book.The ""step by step"" instructions are not.All the projects have a bill of materials but not detailed info to build any of them.In the book the writter refers to ""see fig 9 but there is no pics labeled at all.I was hoping for a book with detailed instructions to build the projects.Not so.All info is vague at best.I wish I had bought the book instead of digital download.Maybe I could re-coupe some of my investment.If your looking for a book with plans to follow this is NOT it.I would not reccomend this book if you want a book to follow the plans to re-create the projects in this book.Impossible!"
5,Amazing Movie!,This is one of the most edge-of-your-seat amazing thrillers I have ever watched. Sigourney Weaver has always been one of my favorite actresses and she does not disappoint in this one. Well worth buying!
4,7's an unlucky number,"Serial killer psychologist who survived a strangulation some years prior is enlisted by the local police force when a serial killer starts patterning himself after other famous killers. Much better plotted and ran through than Se7en, this film is much more interesting and slicker. Doesn't use full scale gore and torture techniques to produce scares and even packs a few laughs."
4,Love this movie,Back when this movie first came out it was one of my favorites. I was 13 when it came out so I thought it was just my age. Turns out I still like it.
1,I expected more... Quite disappointing,"I ordered this book on a whim... Found it non-engaging, repetitive and redundant. The author makes an attempt to give countless specific and almost insignificant details, which drove me nuts... I usually read books in days, but it has taken me about a month to finish this one. A drag masked as a love story and tale of self discovery. One word... boring"
4,Es Cuba: Life and Love on an Illegal Island,This is a good book because it is interesting and it gives a lot of information about Cuba. An enjoyable summer read.
1,Pure Junk,"I bought 2 of these to spray engine degreaser and they never worked properly. I have an industrial air compressor with plenty of air to power it and had to put an air regulator on the actual gun to lower the psi to about 60lbs just to get it to spray,but at this low psi its pointless because it doesn't have enough air pressure to clean properly. I wish i never bought 2 let alone 1. Now i have a high priced air gun. SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE AND DON'T BUY IT!!"
2,breakbeats with vocals,Broken beats with female singers such as Marzenka and Bajka (both sing with Beanfield). (...) I don't like it as much as most stuff on the Compost label.
2,This Album Is Not That Great,Beyonce is so beautiful and she is a good singer but her album [is not good]. The only good tracks on the album are Naughty Girl and Baby Boy and Crazy In Love. You can tell that you should not spend your money on an album when the only good tracks are the hit singles. Because if the only good tracks are the hit singles you can just go online and download them or stream them for free. There is not use spending your money on the [this bad work].
3,Album is good,"This album needed time to grow on me, i wasn't feeling it at first. I think it's a good album but OVERRATED, it's not worth 5 grammy's at all.Skip this album and pick up Janet's latest ""Damita Jo"""
1,ick,rolling my eyes i dont like this cd it only has a couple good songs on it it is better to buy someone like christina milian who can actually sing she got her spotlight stolen! just dowload the couple decent beyonce songs this cd is not worth it. very disappointed.
4,Its better than B-Day...,"Its funny to read these reviews from 3 years ago (its 2006 now) and then compare them to B-Day's reviews. There are so many people (myself included) who long for the quality of Dangerously in Love. I loved this album because it seems as though B is giving us a glimpse of the different facets of Beyonce. Her songwriting is superb compared to B-Day. One thing that I would have to disagree with a lot of reviewers of Dangerously in Love is that I don't think this album had a lot of bad fillers. I think that the whole thing (Minus: That's how you like it, The closer I get to you, and that song about her dad)was pretty good. I love Hip Hop Star, and Speechless. My only complaint is that she should have used the Dangerously in Love from Destiny's Child's Survivor. They changed the music, and it sounded kind of corny. Other than that, I thought it was a great debut album."
3,"Average album, made worse by genius single","After hearing 'Crazy in Love' a million times on the radio and still loving it I had to buy Beyonce's solo-album. I can only rarely be as disappointed as I was when I heard it at full-length.'Crazy in Love' takes pride of place as it should but, in a way, it ruins the rest of the album. There are only a couple of tracks that raise any interest on the rest of the album but they are nothing new or original.The only thing I can really say about this album, is that it shows a rising star (not that she isn't already) who will one-day become a legend. It might take a while though."
1,"Tired, uninspired.","What a let down! Beyonce has everything needed to be a huge star except songs. This CD, with the exception of ""Crazy in Love"", is boring and uninspired. I was expecting a lot but she just re-hashes the old Destiny Child formula so it sounds like a collection of outtakes from the horrible ""Survivor"" CD.Most of the songs are either over wrought ballads or hip hop dance tunes that never catch and just sputter out after about 3 minutes.She also makes the ""Mariah Mistake"" of inviting every rapper from the 'hood to ""guest"" and then watching them overtake the song and rob it of any flow or melody."
1,Over Hyped Effort,"I hate to say it, but this was a waste of my money. I agree with others that Crazy in Love is about the best song on the album, and just about the only one worth listening to twice. She doesn't actually sing on the rest of the album, she warbles, and halfway through the CD I couldn't listen anymore, because she doesn't even do that well. The lyrics are juvenile. And what's up with the love song to her Dad??? I can't recommend this album to anyone. Try again Beyonce."
4,good for her first time,"the album is coolshe did a great jobi don't like her but what she did is wonderfulRESPECT;Buy this album,cuz it worths your money believe meexcept if u don't like her like me"
3,falls short,Beyonce has too much talent and the album was not as good as it should. Remember Writing's on the Wall and other Destiny's Child work. B you can do much better. Much success and better luck on your next solo joint. The Fighting Temptations soundtrack shows her talent better and the B us fans know.
2,The compositions...,"The compositions are rather moderate here. The sampling of Summer's ""Love To Love You"" is well done. That's it. I can only give those kudos to this LP. It is listenable, whatever that means. Perhaps if Knowles would attempt to sing, instead of sounding as if her vocals were being forced through cotton. I simply do not understand the ""biz"" on her voice. Now, having said that: a good voice is NOT necessary to create great pop music, but this attempt just falls short. It's not good. I tell you, it's not good. Perhaps another vocalist, then, yes I would love this LP."
1,Wack stuff,"Hey wassup with this wack weak-voiced CD? Slick production and guest stars galore don't equal a good CD. Buy some Aretha, Otis Redding, Nirvana, Lauryn Hill, or somebody that can at least sing!"
3,she seemed rushed,I applaud Beyonce for her work but this cd seems rushed and a lot of songs seem out of place
2,Mediocre!,"Boring, dull, put me to sleep. Only bright spot is the duet with Luther Vandross, ""The Closer I Get To You."" Nothing really grabs the listener's attention, and definitely doesn't have the power to hold it. (ZZZzzzzzz!) Do yourself a favor and just by the single of ""Crazy in Love"" because that is the best it gets on this cd."
3,"Not bad and not that great, but it is just her 1st single","What can I say? This CD wasn't my favorite. The duos with different artists on some (most) of the songs add some flare, but if you're gonna go solo, you have to sing alone!! However, I did like a few songs on the CD. Signs was one of my favorites cuz the lyrics are catchy and fun to listen to - at least one thing on the song applies to you. Crazy in Love and Naughty Girl were good, but they make her sound too sleezy. I did not like the flow of the album. Most of the songs are slow, and you end up listening to like...6 slow songs in a row! There aren't even any really fast songs on the cd. Also, the CD was too typical R&B. Just like any other."
3,good,"again, i'm not a big fan of her, but this was a pretty good listen. you can tell that she's had some good loving by listening to a few tracks. my favorite track is daddy."
2,beautiful but not as talented...,"Sure! Ms. Knowles is tall, beautiful and sexy but to think of it... there are other singers as well who is much taller, more seductive and effortlessly talented than her. Songs like ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Baby Boy"" can be easily forgotten as a lot of songs with similar flavors are being thrown away in the bin these days. Knowles has to do something with her songs or do something shocking and different before she is totally forgotten. The album is fairly good for a solo debut, and that is to be respected and be given credit as well."
4,Another pleasant surprise,"Okay I admit it. At first I did not think Beyonce was all that great a singer when she was with Destiny Child. Her debut album really surprised me. I had no plans to purchase the album, but after she performed Dangerously In Love on the grammies I had to have the album.My favorite songs on her album are:Crazy in LoveNaughty GirlBaby BoyMe, Myself and ISignsDangerously In LoveThe album is not bad at all."
4,Good debut..was better than i expected,"I bought this album on the first day..and i wasn't a big fan of Beyonce..although i love mainly the original Destiny's Child music..but anyways i was impressed by the album and I'll give the girl props. The best songs to me are Signs"" and ""Be With You"". I think this album is an album that has to grow on people..it has mostly slow songs..and i'm a ballad person..but i also like the fact that Beyonce didn't oversing on the album and her vocals are stronger to me.I like her more as a vocalist on this album and i think her album is the best out of the group. Although i think that she could have left some of the uptempos off the cd..such : ""Yes"",""That's How U Like It"", and ""Hip-Hop Star (although this one is growing on me), and ""Naughty Girl""but in the end I felt i got my money's worth."
4,"Beyonce, Kicks!",Wow what a album! I wasnt much of a fan of Destinys Child's music but I can honestly say this albumn is the best thing I've heard since Justified!!Buy It!
2,Crazy in Love is Overplayed,Baby Boy is good because Sean Paul is in it. Crazy in Love has been overplayed. The CD is very overated.
3,Wrong thought,"I thought this album will be more of a dancy, fast beat album.. only to find out it's definitely different from what I was expecting.From the moment I heard ""Crazy in Love"" on the radio it immediately came to my mind that ""Hey.. that song sounds good, and it's upbeat and catchy. I'm sure the entire album is fast and dancy-ish, too.""I'm very, very disappointed."
1,Worse than I expected,"This album really falls very short to me. It lacks depth in the lyrics. Beyonce or her voice just does nothing to stop the album from just coming off as generic R&B; (if even that much). It almost sound like a rushed effort to me. But hey that's what i'd expected from lead singer of DC.Best Songs: ""Signs"" & ""Me, Myself, & I""The rest if the songs are all just generic pop based R&B; songs with catchy (uncatchy/annoying) hooks. Its just to repetitive and bland. If you're looking for some really good R&B; try Aaliyah's ""Aaliyah"" or even Brandy's ""Full Moon"". Both albums are far more innovative and add much more to the genre in all honesty. If you're wise you'll definitely leave this one on the shelf!!"
4,"Wrong cd :( but, was refunded :)","Cd came before time and was pre-sealed and wrong cd without extra track like it stated but, I was refunded."
2,Dangerously Over-rated,"Bought it based on the first cut single- big mistake. rest of albums stinks, trite corny lyrics ala: the signs song, baby boy also corny lyrics, only thing that made it radio-playable is the beat. bottomline:not to buy"
1,Terrible!,I really hated this CD! I just bought and it SUCKED! I will never buy anymore of her cd's.
4,Good Job B!!!!!!!!!,"I have to give it to B,she does the thang on this c.d. I bought it because ""Crazy in love"", but i fell in love with ""Be with you""""Yes"" ""Signs"" ""Me, Myself and I"" and ""Speechless"", it's a good album all together fast or slow songs you'll like it. Feel the soul of the soulflower, peace."
5,the best,"This gal can sang. She does her thang solo and with a group. She reveals her sexy side, with Nasty Girl. Also, she reveals her intimate side with The Closer I Get To You. This album deserves to go platinum plus. She is consistent with the vocal and lyrical quality. This album displays hit after hit. Go cop this disk."
2,HIGHLY OVERATED...,"Let me tell you, this album sucks ass. I can't believe she was nominated for 8 grammys. That IS rediculous! The only song, well, I'll say two, that are good are crazy in love and baby boy, but even those aren't THAT great. She has an okay voice, I actually think Kelly Rowes sings better than her. Anyhow, this girl is too overated AND this album. Christina Aguilera can top her any day, songs and voice. I recommend Stripped to this album."
2,She could've added at least one more upbeat song...,"First of all the songs ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Baby Boy"" are tricks. They are tricks to make you think that the rest of the album will be upbeat and danceable. WRONG! Those two songs are the only two that even come close to being good, with the possible exception of ""Naughty Girl"". ""Hip-hop Star"" and ""That's how you like it"" are full of rappers making nonsensical noises in the background. ""Signs"", ""Speechless"" and ""The closer I get to you"" are perfect songs if you are looking for the perfect lullaby. ""Be with you"", ""Me, Myself and i"" and ""Yes"" have immature and bland lyrics(i.e., I love the way you make me feel/it slows down time/come in my bedroom and turn off the lights.) And even the two hit singles are not that great. God have mercy on your soul, Beyonce."
2,I've definetly heard better songs !!,"I guess the CD is ok. I think that Miss Knowles receives way too much credit, definetly more than she deserves. Only the first three songs are good, the rest sucks. Oh yeah, and the hidden track about how much she loves her father and how she wants her husband and son to be like him is the WORST song I have ever heard. It's pathetic and sort of disgusting/disturbing."
4,Actually Not That Bad...,"This cd really is not bad, and she has some pretty good co-stars as well, such as Big Boi & Sean Paul. It didn't blow me off my feet with originality or anything, but I definitely can't think of anything negative to say about it! Way to go Beyonce!"
3,Not Bad,"Not a bad album. I agree with other comments that she did too many ballads and should have put in at least 3 more upbeat songs. She has excellent vocal talent and whether she goes solo and stays with Destiny's Child, she will always do well."
3,eh,"I love the first four songs (especially Baby Boy), but beyond that... oh, and I have to rant on one song in particular... ""Signs"". That song is just dumb. I can't believe I hate a song produced by my hero Missy Eliot... Yeah, this album has mediocrity written all over it, in my opinion. The best songs are the ones that you'll eventually hear on the radio anyway, so save your money."
2,Dosent deserve the hype,"I bought this CD because I couldnt get enough of ""Crazy in Love."" When ""Crazy in Love"" is playing you feel like you could be in for something. After the player moved past Crazy in Love, it was downhill all the way. Songs like Naughty girl, Baby Boy, and Signs have cheesy beats, whil the rest of the album sounds like she slumped together some lame ballads for the sake of making the album long enough. The songwriting is horrible((...), and her singing is only so-so. Get a Destinys Child album for good beyonce material."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I thought that the album was, at best, mediocre. All of the songs sound the same, and it sounds like Beyonce's screaming/wailing throughout the album. The only song that's worth mentioning is ""The Closer I Get to You"" with Luther Vandross. Don't get me wrong, Beyonce has a good voice, but doing the solo album bit is not for her. Her music sounded a WHOLE lot better when she was with D.C. The only reason why she's sold so many albums so far is because of all of the marketing/promoting that they're doing for it. In a month or two, all of the ""hype"" should be over, and her CD will probably end up in a discount bin."
2,A Let Down,"I always thought of Beyonce as a talentless, doe eyed tool with a knack for riding the trends to death but then I saw her sing the national anthem during the infamous Super Bowl, a.k.a ""the Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake"" show. Seeing her rendition gave me a brand new respect for Beyonce Knowles and all the hard work and training she puts into her voice.Bolstered by my newfound respect for her as an artist I bought this CD hoping to find some hidden gem. Here was an opportunity to reveal herself as a force to be reckoned with musically and vocally and she missed it. Just more of the same trend pandering. It's really not her fault though. I blame the spin doctors and music producers that market her career and belittle her talent.For people who like Beyonce exactly like they like her then this CD will be a great addition to your collection. But if you are looking for another side of Beyonce other than a gyrating female cliche in every rap video ever made, save your dough."
1,No. Ew. Yucky fakeness,"I don't own the cd but have listened to the radio in the car of my friend who likes this stuff. I hate pop/r&b, so I don't like this. The lyrics are way too mushy for me. My dad bought it. He never listens to it, though.I don't understand how people like bey-whatever and other ""artists"" like her. The music is so fake, and she doesn't have any REAL talent, she just pretends to.Please, if you're really reading this, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,So-So For The H0,This album is not too bad but it's nothing to run through the store and knock people out the way to get. Beyonce is a decent singer but she's still need some work here and there. The album is better then then their latest DC album which is probably they're worse album. All in all this album is listenable but it does have it's moments were you have to skip here and their like everything. So if you are a fan of R&B dont buy this but if you are a fan of DC or Beyonce then get it. When you are a fan most likely your artist cant do no wrong.
2,fell short,"by the looks of the first single i thought this was a sure hit, but it fell a little short. the only hot singles are the ones with jay-z. sean paul collabo, missy and big boi were half assed! the signs tracks were cheesy. tracks me myself and i was cool. doesn't matter cuz it'll still be the heavy hitter this week, but i would download it rather than pick it up if i were you, but pick up that monica!"
3,Could have been better,"I dont really think that she shuld have would a whole album on her Jay-Z episodes. And ""Signs"" should have been called sagittarius and the other signs."
1,Horrible,"save your money for a real cd like: Artist: Big Tymers Album: Big Money Heavyweights Realease: November 18, 2003"
3,solo star,"The long-awaited solo debut from Destiny's Child's lead singer Beyonce Knowles is a great collection of uptempo dance tracks with hot beats and slow, sweet ballads. I'm not really feelin' her first single, ""Crazy In Love"" but the other tracks are awesome. With help from music artists such as Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, and Luther Vandross, this album is sizzling and electrifying..and a definite chart-topper!"
3,Which song from the Chi-Lites??,Decent album...does anyone know which Chi-Lites song is sampled for the horns in Crazy in Love? Thanks for the help.
2,Not her best...,"I love Beyonce, but I was pretty dissapointed with this album. The best songs are the first three: ""Crazy in Love,"" ""Naughty Girl"" and ""Baby Boy."" ""Hip-Hop Star"" is energetic, but Beyonce dosen't really sing, it just whispers. The album gets temporarily back on track with ""Be With You."" ""Me, Myself and I"" and ""Yes"" are somewhat catchy but are filled with a variety of annoying dighital sounds. The rest of the album, except for ""Dangerously in Love 2"" is way too underproduced, and provides the perfect soundtrack for drifting off to sleep. The soloution: Beyonce, try to just let it flow, and have dighital sonds take precedence over your singing."
4,greeeeat job beyonce!!!,"i gave this cd a 4 out of 5 because there were some pretty dayum good beats to listen to on here. my fav songs are, crazy in love, naughty girl, be with you, me myself & you, yes, speechless, dangerously in love 2, gift from virgo, daddy. a lot of the songs are really good..so this is worth every penny!!!"
1,"She is HOT, but she stinks!","Beyonce is really hot. That does not mean that she is a good musician. She is horrible. The only thing she can do good is ""Shake her stuff"". If I were any of you people I would not buy this cd or even think about it."
5,"Short but ""SASSY""",All you have to do is listen to the song samples to know why you need this cd in your Sarah Vaughan Collection. Only eight songs but well worth it.
2,Good...If you're tired and dont have a brain,"i saw this, like many other people, shown as the sequal to ninja scroll (an amazing movie and well worth buying). what i got was not as expected so i thought it was tripe after seeing it. well i then looked at it in it's own merits. one problem, there wern't many. slow plot, poor fight scenes and needless sex (does than annoy anyone else?). well, i gave it two stars because it HAS got a storyline and some good scenes. not one to rush out and buy though."
1,Yes there is a reason this anime has more negitive revews then positive...,"For one thing this film has nothing to do with the Better Anime film Ninja Scroll,This anime realy is a sore sight with a poorly done plot, Poorly done writing and a Clifhanger that well makes you just want to Vomit.I am not sure why they never finnished this anime but if they would have it prolly would of saved it from being as Vomit enducing as it is.The bottom line, Voilence, Nudity, Sex with a Deing person, just realy sums up this toxic waste of a anime.Trust me you would want to avoid this incompleate waste....."
3,The Makaitensho lives on.,"Little do people know the original Jubie Yagyu, or the real story. Yes it has been done before in Samuri Shodown The video game. The same characters and almost everything. The movie was great and they need to finish the story with it's sequel, Amakusa Shiro's rebirth."
2,"Better than the first one, still can't compare to Ninjascrol","This second volume is actually a bit better than the first one, it has more plots that involve jubei(that what gives better at rating than the first one). It also contains a lot of senseless killing with serious vilolent in a bad way. I don't mind the blood or violent stuffs, but they don't look very artistic as ninja scroll. Overall it better than the first one but still didn't convince me this is a verygood series, hopefully the next volume will turn out to be better."
2,Revenge of Jubei sadly unfamiliar,"At first glance, Revenge of Jubei sounds like a sequel to Ninja Scroll. Don't be fooled. The Jubei in Revenge is NOT the Jubei in Ninja Scroll. While the animation is okay, neither it or the storyline is worth the 20+ dollars. Plus it's only 50 minutes long! Just as the action heats up, you get ""to be continued"" as the screen goes black. Worth renting, but don't buy it until the series is finished and put into a continous format like was done with Battle Angel."
2,not worth your time,"Okay, so this is part one of a two-part OAV. I was pretty much bored with the story during the first 20 minutes and then repelled by the amount of gore and torture during the next 30 minutes. Then, just as I thought things were going to get cool, the credits roll...The dubbing was okay for the most part. If decapitation, gore and torture are your thing, then, this anime is for you. But if you're like me, there are better ninja anime (uh.. Ninja Scroll) to see instead of this."
4,"Great story line,keeps you on point for the next installment","I am a huge fan of ""Ninja Scroll""!!! While the ""Revenge of Jubei"" is not directly a spinoff of ""Scroll"", the story is very well written and very interesting. True, the ending is somewhat abrupt and the storyline is a sort of tangent from ""Scroll"",but it kept my interest throughout the movie( which,being that I'm a female fan,I think you men can appreciate.).True anime fans will appreciate this feature. And for those of you that didn't really care for it, Get a Clue!!!! That's the beauty of Anime...it is everchanging, but always on point!!!"
1,"If you like Ninja Scroll, you'll HATE THIS!!",The animation is amateurish and the story line was so weak I couldn't bring myself to finish the movie. DO NOT BUY this movie or rent it. It's a waste of your time!
4,"Demented but alluring, only.... its incomplete!","I think most would agree that this anime is rather demented - but also unique, and ultimately... alluring. Its dementia is thoroughly entertaining.It also boasts one of the most impressive scores in any animation!A must see if you like things that are unusual.There is only one big problem - it is INCOMPLETE!This is a two part OVA, but it seems fairly obvious that it was intended to be at least a four part series (when viewed together forming one epic length film). It certainly needs at least two more parts to finish what has been brought up in the first two. As far as I know it has never been finsihed, and it does not appear that it will be... (if anyone knows of a completion, do write about it)A shame really, as this would have been a real one of a kind bit of work."
1,dont buy this,"This piece of junk is nothing compared to its predecessor. The only way it relates to ninja scroll is that Jubei the main character Ninja scroll is in it. Jubei is a completely different character and not nearly as cool as in the previous movie. Trust me I may not be very descriptive on this review but dont buy this unless you have to. TRUST ME SERIOUSLY. IF you just want an anime get, Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, Princess Mononoke, Akira, Ninja Scroll (OF COURSE) and Spriggan. These ones youll need to add to your anime collection. This movie is very very gory. You got internal organs popping out when ever theres a fighting scene. Always you see like woman get raped."
2,Not so great,"I generally love the Philosophy Brand. However, I am not a big fan of the Present. I used it for a week and it gave my face a rash. Then I waited about 6 weeks later to try it again and the same thing happened. I also experienced a break out of 2 pimples the second time around. I never ever break out on my face! It also feels very heavy. However, I do have sensitive skin so that might be the reason. I will still continue to use Philosophy products, just not this one."
3,Not Sure,I don't think this works well with my skin. I used it as a base prior to putting make up on but I found it to be thick and cakey. I also found small specks of flakes on my face after an hour. I don't know if it is the product itself or it just doesn't fit well with my skin.
2,"Saturday Morning Serial, Middle-eastern Style","This novel is diverting the way a Saturday morning series would be: it emphasizes action over theme, plot over character, peril episodes over suspense. The main characters show little motivation, but instead work with various magical powers. The plot never really endangers any of the primary players, and therefore will not be disturbing to sensitive readers. The fantasy world depicted is not meant to make any incisive remarks or observations of our world-- rather, it serves to provide an escape from our world."
5,Pilla Hits A Home Run,"I have been fooling around with a so called ""tax professional"" for nearly eight weeks, trying to get him to contact the IRS and California Franchise Tax Board and get my penalty abated. One hour spent with this awesome book gave me the reasons and words to state my case for abatement.Buy it. Awesome."
5,CPA winning cases with info learned from this book,"As a CPA I am becoming aware of the frequent IRS notices received. I have always utilized this book on each of my cases (mostly individual). It has help me formulate correspondence and strategies. This book will give you insights of the IRS, including statistics on the number of audits, collections and notices. I have been very successful in tax controversy work. I go straight to this book before ever going to my CPE related info. Buy it!"
4,Great information,"Received it before the date expected (nice!) and in great shape; no tears, welts, marking, or stains. It's informative and covers more ground than I expected. The english is plain and easy to follow (in layman's terms) without all the legal jargon to impress and confuse. Gives plenty of references and citings. Also, it isn't a ""1,2,3 steps"" outline, but I have learned much. Still not finished reading."
4,this is a good game,"i don't know why people give this game such bad reviews.i've been playing FPS's since half life and unreal tournament and this game is a GOOD GAME!great graphics- good reproduction of WWII weapons- lots of nazis shooting at you- lots of nazis to shoot back- great explosions- it gives you a sense of actually being out there on the battlefield.great sound and audio as well.i've played through to the last set of missions,and have started over on easy because it gets to hard-yes- your squad gets F'd up easily-YES you take real damage from bulets-- i don't worry about the team too much,though--i heal them once in awhile-but if they don't make it- you don't need them to finish the mission.you have to keep your head down and make real decisions and real shots to get through and i think that makes this game great.worlds better than rising sun!!!like a whole different game!"
2,Junk,MOH series has fallen on it's face with the past two entries. Rising sun sucked and so does European Assault. I'll give that this one is better than Rising sun but that's not saying anything. The gameplay is simple and bland. The A.I. is retarded. Boring missions and your sqaud is a useless feature. The MOH series needs a serious boost if it wants to ever have success again.
5,Playful,"One of the modern great novels, though certainly a slap in the face to academia (The Institute). Alasdair Gray has read widely and with such thought that he can be so playful with many themes. Read his Book of Prefaces, whether you enjoyed this massive and sometimes rambling headtrip of book or not. I feel William S Burroughs' Cities of the Red Night trilogy to be one of the only modern literary worlds to compare with . . ."
1,Would have gotten a zero if that were an option,"Sucked! I was so excited, but then so let down. How dare they claim it's like IMAX? Geez. Nothing but lines. I could barely make out the picture and ended up with a headache. A couple of times the effect was almost neat, but most of the time it just plain sucked. Shame on you guys. You suck."
3,"Great performances, plastic sound","While I agree whole heartedly with the virtues of these performances spoken of by the other reviewers, I have to subtract some stars for John Vana's sound. The collaboration between John Vana and Jenny Perron is wonderful. The performance of the Muczynski is brilliant and spirited. But I wish he would lose the Fibracell reeds before recording again. The plastic buzzing on certain notes is cloying. The low register is unfocused and defuse, especially at low volumes. Overall the saxophones sound is somewhat thin, buzzy and lacking in the warmth of a full round core. While the plastic reeds do seem to afford him technical facility and an altissimo that is seamlessly matched with the other registers, they create an undesirable one-dimensionality to his sound."
5,not applicable,"sorry, but this is not about the book. we are doing a thesis about parenting styles and we need diana baumrind's 4 types of parenting styles. please tell us where to look for these. we'll waiting for ur response."
5,Great lamp!,"This is a beautiful, high quality lamp at a reasonable price- love it!I am considering buying another one soon."
4,Table Lamp Review,"The lamp is unusual, could be comtempory or Oriental. Colors will blend with any decorating styles. I wish that it was a three way light and that the light could be adjusted up higher. Having it on an end table is really too low to use as a reading lamp. I do enjoy the style, made me think of Frank Lloyd Wright. I would purchase this lamp again."
5,nice style,"I just received this lamp and I love it. Just a very few simple, simple parts to screw together and it looks great! I looked at literally thousands of lamps on the internet and saw one I liked for $700! and it didn't look that different from this one. So I feel it was a great buy, shed a really nice soft light, and the 3-way switch is a nice touch."
2,Characterization was not believable,"I read this trilogy with high expectations, but was disappointed. The incorporation of almost every aspect of every legend was in places clever, but a bit too much of a stretch to be believable. The characters were one dimensional, and Guinevere, in particular, just seemed clueless as to the world around her. In my opinion, she was not at all a likeable heroine. I much prefer Nancy McKenzie's The Child Queen and the High Queen."
4,A wonderful surprise of a book,"When this book first appeared, all you could find for Arthuriana were riffs and rip-offs of Mists of Avalon or the Merlin trilogy. Sharan Newman has created a world where magic is not apologized for, where the silly as well as the heroic happens, where the legends are allowed to BE without adding some sort of polically correct nonsense. This is not a historical book, neither is it the legends as set in stone. Instead it is a delightful tale of a young woman of magical qualities coming of age in a time not truly meant for her. The tale is loving, kind, silly, harsh, and deeply magical. A truly enjoyable work."
4,Interesting twist on a classic tale,"I first read this book in my teens (about 10 years ago), but recently re-read the trilogy. This is an intersting twist on a classic tale. Although the characters (like Guinever) can sometimes be annoying, it is an overall good read for those intersted in Celtic myths and tales of Camelot."
1,If you are a high school senior...,"If you are like myself a high school senior reading this book for English class, GOOD LUCK! It is by far the least interesting novel I have ever read. Skip it and just look up the sparknotes."
2,I dont understand it,"I read this book for my 12th grade English class and all I have to say about the book is it made as much sence as a 3 dollar hooker charging 2 dollars. It's all about different ways of thinking such as idealism and reaalism ect. I just don't think it was a good book because it just wasn't holding my attention; I guess because I didn't understand it. I would recomend this book for a rocket scientist or poet, but not for a regular, average guy like myself."
1,Beowulf is better...,"I read this book for class after reading Beowulf, which I surprisingly enjoyed. This book focuses on the monster from the original poem, Grendel. While I liked the fact that the character was developed more and made sympathetic, the structure of the book was a little strange. I also felt like sometimes I was missing was the author was trying to say. I think this is quite problematic since the book is marketed to a young adult audience and I'm out of that age group. I would only recommend reading this if you read Beowulf and want a different perspective, otherwise, leave it."
3,Grendel,"""Grendel"" was hard to understand. I guess one had to read ""Bewoulf"" to understand ""Grendel"". Towards the end, the book became interesting (somewhat)."
5,WOO GRENDEL WOO!,"Grendel was an excellent book. It is the epic story of Beowulf from the monsters point of view. John Gardner uses very descriptive scenes that make it very easy to picture the many actions and emotions grendel is going through. It can be read again and again. Each time getting a different meaning and purpose out of the text. You are able to truly connect to Grendel throughout his struggle to find himself, as well as, his place in the world. Grendel discovers the many questions that arise when one is faced with the challenges of faith and communication with others. Grendel seems to be on a quest of the meaning of being."
5,Top book of all times,"Reading all of the reviews for this book, I find there is very little left to say about the subject matter. The prose though... The WONDERFUL prose of John Gardner. Even if you don't care for the many meanings found in this book, you will love the beautiful, and sometimes stark, prose. When I'm between books, I'll pick up Grendel, open it to ANY page, and read away. I just love the way it's written. My favorite book of all times. (The Sunlight Dialogues is another great John Gardner novel)"
3,Grendel,"This is a strange little book--not at all what I expected. Once I accepted the definitely non-epic style, it was sometimes entertaining. To teachers, I would say that you couldn't put this book into classroom libraries in more conservative schools. Not that most kids would want to read it anyway."
4,Got what was advertised,"I got what I ordered but it took a really long time to get it. It did come before the expected delivery date, but I really expected to get it within a week and it took about 2 weeks."
2,Brief book review,"This book (both volumes) is widely known, but really shows its age. It deals with quite large machines, whereas I wanted to know more detail about how to mark out very small metal parts and use small machines."
5,"Clear, concise, and meaty little book!","This is a simple, very quick read that covers all the basics. I read this as part of an MBA course on buying a small business at Babson College. The book's process and lessons were validated by every business owner and professor who spoke. The best thing about this book is that it gives a great understanding of the PROCESS for buying a business, recognizing that the tiny details of each deal will be unique. As a buyer, it's extremely helpful to feel comfortable that you know what's supposed to happen next.I augmented reading this book by calling and emailing different business brokers to discuss opportunities and listings they had; there was a whole other level of learning that took place through those conversations and meetings, but I think reading this book is the perfect first step.Finally, a clear, concise and meaty little book you can use!"
4,Kids love it,Was shipped very quickly! The kids love it at my church! And theres lesson plans that go along with it (lessons plans dont come with DVD). Great movie for kids that is clean and funny :)
4,Great book good insight,"The book is great has positive insight about the after life gives a peace of mind, it's a quick read & you can't put the book down!"
2,Nope...not enough meat or potatoes,"I like John Edward, and watch his TV show, which is fascinating. I liked his second book - crossing over. But this book just goes on and on with the same, and no new information. I just read a book by Tiffany Snow that gives exercises on how to see ghosts, stories about helping with unfinished business, and also stuff on the ""bump in the night"" kinds of ghosts. I liked hers better. John never talks about the other kinds of invisible forces there are out there - and I needed to know that too. Not all ghosts are dead people trying to say they love us. Maybe its the folks NOT on TV that are the cutting edge, I don't know. But, what I do know is that I'm going to a book store next time and thumbing through his next book before I buy it. If it's more of hte same, I'm writing him off."
4,A Peek into Eternity,"This was a well-written and thought-provoking book that forces you to examine your beliefs about life after death. It raised many questions as to my own purpose in this life, and the priceless relationships that go with us into eternity. It is a serious message of faith,hope and love."
2,This Book,"This is the second John Edward book I have attempted to read. The first one was ""What if God Where In The Sun."" I have never seen one author driveling over their mother so much in my life. It is obvious that the man has ""issues."" So I decide well surely he has matured, perhaps he is a better writer now. Well, I was sadly disappointed. This time he also rattles on about his father. You would think that someone with this sort of talent would apply himself in such a way that it would better society. He explains little to nothing about the afterlife, & I had a sense when I was reading it that he most likely didn't even write the book. The commercial plugs in the book are downright shameful as well. This book is about lining John Edward's pockets plain and simple."
4,An important book about Political Correctness.,"An extremely important work and one that should be read by anyone interested in the uses of Political Correctness for repression. In ordinary circumstances a person like Dr. Barbara would either remain harmless or would swiftly be judged an intellectual fraud and a homocidal maniac. What this woman succeeds in doing, however, is to use the ""liberal"" predilections of other people against them to contrive dystopic circumstances that are extraordinary, putting her outside the possibility of judgment and allowing her to murder at will. The models for Dr. Barbara derive from such ancient sources as the myth of the Women of Lemnos and such modern ones as Moby Dick: she is a feminist Captain Ahab and is endowed with all of Melville's madman's persuasiveness and executive skills. A brilliant book, which belongs on the same shellf with Brave New World, 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and Lord of the Flies."
2,Cocteau Twins and Sxousie and the Banshees!,This band does not have anything original to contribute to this genre.
3,Another Duckula (In Spanish),"I know that everybody remembers Count Duckula, but I have a very nice news.Recently I went to Mexico for business and guess what?... I found Count Duckula with english and spanish audio tracks, not only 3 DVD, but 9 DVD with over 60 chapters!!!. That's right. Two complete seasons (season one with 30 chapters and season two with 39). Believe it or not Count Duckula exists with more chapters than this colection.Of course my first impression was ""This is a bootleg DVD"". But not. This is the real McCoy for Latin America. Count Duckula (or Conde P√°tula in spanish) was transmitted for two complete seasons. Maybe Amazon could try to offer this product maybe for colectors or just for another curiosity in DVD's zone 4."
5,SHOCKING TO FIND THIS ON DVD AT LAST!!!!!!,"I got volume 1 from the UK and since they released it, they never released another volume.A few years later, i discover that the entire first season is released here in the US, what a thrill.I hope that they will release all of them rather than just releasing season one and forgetting about the rest of them."
1,Bland light pop!!,I am 25 and a rock fan and back in the day when their 1st album came out I thought these guys were cool alternative rockers. Since then they have changed their sound and put out boring pop songs. Do not buy this album unless you want boring put you to sleep music!
4,"Good effort, it's their 3rd best album.","I think the first four songs are awesome! There is one sappy song with a chorus that is actually the first song that doesn't do it for me...the song would have been better if they left that part out. Disease rocks pretty good...Unwell is very catchy. Still like the first album best. If you like MB20, then you'll like this."
5,incredible,this album is absolutely awesome. it could be their best yet. highly recommend it for everyone.
2,Another disappointment from MB20,"When is Rob Thomas going to realize he is NOT Carlos Santana? Since their first album, Yourself or Someone Like You, Matchbox Twenty has changed their sound and not for the better. Yourself was a powerful CD with great lyrics that really showcased the band's writing and singing talents. The sound that sold millions of copies of their freshman effort, however, disappeared with Thomas' collaboration on Smooth and the MB20 sophomore album Mad Season. It's not that the second and third CDs are terrible; they just don't sound like the same band that produced Yourself. And while there's not a track on Yourself that I don't like, I found my finger frequently brushing the forward button when I listened to Mad Season and More. Here's hoping the fourth album sounds like the Matchbox Twenty of Yourself fame."
5,Matchbox Twenty ROCKS my SOCKS.,"This is just an awesome album. I love every song on this thing, except for ""You're So Real"". Even the bonus track is awesome. It's crazy how creative these guys can be! Downfall, it was perfect to put a choir in there...Unwell is a great song cuz it's hugely relatable, as Rob would put it ""By the time you get around thirty, you find that every one's a little f**ked up, and if you don't see that, than you're f**ked up anyways."" The whole CD is relatable. The song ""The Difference"" is a bit depressing but awesome all the same. I don't even know what my favorite song is, and that's good on an album so you don't keep skipping to it and missing all the other songs.I've always been a matchbox twenty fan, I liked their songs when they came out, my favorite song by them was ""Mad Season""....Bottom line. Matchbox Twenty ROCKS MY SOCKS and if they don't rock yours, see them in concert, and they'll be rockin' your socks till the cows come home."
1,Ugggh....,"I only had to listen to ""Stuck"" and ""More to life"" to know that Stacie was definitely not for me. She may have talent, but if you feel like you can dance to this music... then I don't think that is good. Stacie would be doing more harm than good by writing songs that make you want to dance. I have only liked 2 out of all the songs on her albums and the rest were just blah!!!! I would have given this album zero stars if I could.I had asked my mom for this album for Christmas and she refused to get it for me. I am sooooo thankful that she didn't because I believe that it would have affected my walk with God. Then again that is just my opinion. For people who want more of rock/pop christian music that doesn't make you want to dance listen to Rebecca St. James. Now SHE is good!!!! :-)"
2,Lost her Faith!,"Stacie had a strong first CD but she turned her head on God and decided to go mainstream. Although it's better than other sleazy artists, she must not lose sight of her pusrpose in life which is to serve the lord in the way that we live."
5,I'M STUCK ON,"THIS CD IS WORTH EIGHTEEN DOLLARS SIMPLY FOR ""STUCK,"" IT IS AN ADDICTING SONG, THE ONLY SONG OF STACIE'S I CAN LISTEN TO OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER!!!!!!!! AWESOME LYRICS, HER VOCALS ARE STUNNING IN THAT SONG, FANTASTIC PRODUCTION (THE BEST-SOUNDING SONG HERE), AND...AND....IT'S JUST ALL INCREDIBLE!!! I LOVE ""STUCK"" I THINK I'LL SAY IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER: STUCKSTUCK[...] LOL I SCREWED UP A LITTLE WHO CARES BUY THIS ALBUM NOW YOU WILL SHRIVEL INTO A TINY BALL OF BURNT SKIN IF YOUR BODY IS DEPRIVED OF THE EARTH-SHATTERING SONG ""STUCK"" FOR A SECOND LONGER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING??!!! GO GET IT NOOOOOOWWW!!"
1,Why Read It?,"I was going to purchase this book, but now that the 'Editorial Review' has given the ending away, I guess I don't need to!!!!"
1,Pretentious junk,"The first third of Mating is promising enough - good writing, good characters, etc. By the end of the book I was so nauseated by the boring psuedo-intellectual conversations. It was a bit like ""The Blair Witch Project,"" only instead of idiot kids freaking out in the woods, you get self-satisfied Ivory-tower types freaking out in Botswana.Rush's erudition is praised in several reviews. Just because the man makes you have to look up foreign phrases doesn't mean his writing is any better or more intelligent than others. Just more pretentious. In fact, while Rush does a fantastic job of playing ""stump the reader"" with his snippets of vocabulary from several language, he manages to use Japanese incorrectly. It's a ""yukata"" not a ""yakuta."" Which just goes to show that even pompous gits need good editors too.Try Rush's short stories to see if you can tolerate him before embarking on this queasy whites-whine-in-Africa waste."
2,Too wordy...,"I picked up this book since it was in the 25 best american novels ever written according to the New-York Times. Initially, I was interested since the story unfolds in Africa and I knew little about that continent, however, Norman Rush's prose feels really heavy, and, in the end, it wears you out.I don't recommend this book, instead, pick up A fine balance by Rohinton Mistry. Much better story unfolding in another country."
2,pompous and trite,"Both main characters were annoying and neither was very sexy. Mr. Rush seems too concerned with sounding academic, and not concerned enough with creating a story anyone would care about. His attempt to write an intellectual love story merely results in a pompous mess. Too many authors, Mr. Rush included, have lost sight of the fact that the most intelligent story is often the one told simply"
1,A Pedantic Display,This was a book that had to be read with the dictionary in the other hand. There are several sentences with at least three or more words that are unknown to the average reader. I read and reviewed this book as a member of a women's book club. There are 11 members of this club and I was one of five that finished it. We didn't see how Rush managed to win an award for such literature. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
3,Not as good as you want it to be,"A promising beginning degenerates into typical male thinking about women. Touches about expatriate life are brilliant, but when Rush gets on the subject of woman's thinking, he gets bogged down. Made me want to go read books by women about women to get a real perspective, or Wally Lamb's She's Come Undone, which actually does get it"
4,3 Green Lantern Stories!,"Hey, DC is sure treating Green Lantern with RESPECT! This Hardcover is beautifully drawn and all three stories are linked. No, the heros are not linked, but the villian IS linked to the three heros. I always LOVED Green Lantern and writer Ron Marz showed me why. All Lanterns are modest, heroic , and very reader friendly. It's easy to be a fan right away! I loved the short self contained stories. I don't feel like an idiot because I missed something of the past or of other issues. The fight scenes are nicely done. But there's more than the three Green Lanterns, there are a bunch of cameo appearances from JSA, Teddy Roosevelt, etc. In all, this something I hope DC continues to produce. The price is well worth it. It'll be shame to buy this in Softcover for the hardcover is much easier to maintain for a long time. The GLs are timeless. The story won't be altered no matter what the current comics do. And finally, the art is just wonderful. Not Alex Ross great, but it is close."
5,A life changer,"I wish this book wasn't so expensive. It's a beautiful read, and has alot of heart. Parents and families of today should read this book."
4,Scales,"These scales work good unless you take a diurectic regularly. If so, it won't be able to give you the fat and water content."
3,not worth the money,"I was so excited about this purchase and became more excited when it arrived and I learned how easy it is to use. However, I quickly learned that it is far from accurate. I personally spent the money on this product because I wanted accuracy not just the guessing game. I can stand on the scale and get a reading, step off, step on again and get a totally different reading. That is screaming inaccuracy to me. Its easy to set up and use, but who knows if anything it tells you is true or not."
1,This charger does *NOT* work on a CDM 8900,"I don't know which device this charger works on, but I can tell you it does *not* work on, fit in, or provide any use for an Audiovox CDM 8900."
1,miss songs,"there are songs missing, the original album has 15 teen songs. i bought the album and favorite songs like ""Call His Name"" and other are missing."
4,"Snake in An Apartment (with Terrorist Killers, Too)","Originally released in 1981, I remember the movie poster featuring the hard sell tagline: ""See It Before the Lines Form!"" Wishful thinking, as it turned out, but this is still a pretty good suspense film, with at least a couple of extraordinarily skin-crawlingly intense scenes. In fact, I'd think people who saw the movie about the same time I did will probably ONLY remember those scenes, really. Plus, as a bonus, the snake used in the movie is an actual Black Mamba snake, not some cheesy special effects knockoff. If you are afraid of snakes, this won't be the movie for you, as at least one death in the movie will almost certainly give you nightmares.This skilfully made thriller also has a top notch cast including Klaus Kinski, Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Nicol Williamson, Susan George and Michael Gough. Plus a REAL Black Mamba as..., well, the scary Black Mamba. (I gave this movie an extra star for the use of the Black Mamba in a starring role.)"
5,Moniuszko's Masterpiece!,"Moniuszko is revered in Poland, but forgotten nearly everywhere else. He and Chopin define Polish nationalism in music.Not only is this a fabulous performance up and down the line, this work is not to be missed. Don't let the title fool you! This opera is a hilarious love comedy. The melodic inspiration is on the highest level. (I'm reminded most of Weber. rather than the Italians with their florid and pretty but rather artificial and trite diatonic tunes.) The melodic and harmonic inventiveness is on the highest level. It's a tragedy that this opera is not more well known. Several years ago Sarasota (FL) Opera did his ""Halka""...I wish they'd do THIS one. Perhaps a DVD will be issued someday.I feel it EASILY ranks with the dozen or so greatest comic operas (e. g. Meistersinger, Falstaff, Barber, Liebesverbot) of all time!"
4,Sight and Sound,"We've been fans of Michael Hearne and South by Southwest for many years. In fact the first time we ever danced together was at an outdoor venue in northern New Mexico, with Michael and South by Southwest playing. Michael is a dedicated and awesomely talented musician, singer, and songwriter. The songs on this cd are some of my all time favorites."
4,Who is that plant named after???,"If you've ever wondered who the ""Betty Corning"" clematis or the ""Carol Mackie"" daphne was named after, then here's the book for you. Over 40 individuals who've had plants named after them are profiled here. Each person's biography and how their namesake came about is covered in a 2-4 page chapter. A photo of each person is included. A section in the middle of the book features color photos of the plants.Among those included are Jane Bath (Bath's Pink dianthus), Molly Bush (heuchera), Vince Dooley (hydrangea), Katie Ferguson (rhododendron), Azilda Gerbing (rhododendron), Kim Hawks (echinacea), Frank Meyer (lemon), Jane Platt (magnolia), Betty Sheffield (camellia), Nellie Stevens (holly), George Tabor (rhododendron), Frances Williams (hosta) and many more."
5,THE MOST ORIGINAL ALBUM I HAVE PURCHASED IN 10 YEARS,"THE FINEST ALBUM OF INSTRUMENTAL STRAIGHT AHEAD JAZZ WITH COUNTRY INSTRUMENTATION I HAVE EVER HEARD. THIS IS NOT SOME SIMPLE REPETITIOUS WESTERN SWING LIKE ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL. IT IS FAR BETTER. GATTON'S PLAYING THROUGH A LESLIE SPEAKER IS SOMETHING ELSE. HE IS THE FINEST INTER-GENRE GUITARIST THIS WORLD HAS EVER PRODUCED. SWING, ROCKABILLY, BLUES, COUNTRY, AND STRAIGHT AHEAD JAZZ. HE CAN DO IT ALL. THIS IS DEFINITELY STRAIGHT AHEAD STUFF. HE COULD TRADE LICKS WITH THE COLTRANE, SONNY STITT, RAY BROWN, AND OSCAR PETERSON'S OF THE WORLD ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. EMMONS IS QUITE FRANKLY THE BEST STEEL PLAYER EVER. HE DOES NOT PLAY TWANGY PEDAL STEEL BUT ATTACKS THE INSTRUMENT WITH A FLUIDITY AND PHRASING THAT IS PURE GENIOUS. ""SONG OF INDIA"" GAVE ME TEARS OF JOY JUST LISTENING TO IT. A MASTERPIECE. IT'S NOT 5 STARS BUT 500 STARS"
1,The most BORING textbook ever,I always read textbooks for classes cover to cover. I cannot do that with this one...it is just that boring. Hopefully my college will choose a different book for future students.
4,Practical yet detailed,"A fine book on the subject with respected contributors. Strikes a ""balance"" between useful practical information and detailed support for information provided. Well worth owning. Would be good to see a new edition come out some time, though."
4,Channeled material from F.W.H. Myers,"Classicist and scientific investigator of psychic phenomena, Professor Myers was one founders of the British Society for Psychical Research. His *magnum opus* (while still alive) was a massive book called *Human Personality and It's Survival of Bodily Death* Myers is credited by many with anticipating the work of both Freud and Jung in his analyses of the human psyche. Geraldine Cummins was a British lady of some social standing but who was not particularly well educated & who supposedly would have lacked the detailed & deep knowledge of philosophy and the Greek classics exhibited in this channeled material. The work purports to give a detailed account of the *Other Side* I found it plausible, possibly even evidentiary, but not conclusive proof. But that is the maximum I would say about any work such as this."
5,"Essential, scary reading","About a fascinating chapter in American history, and how the democratic process prevailed--barely--over the certain vested interests in the military-industrial complex. Makes Dwight Eisenhower look like a prophet--and also details some of the career of Edward Tellar, rightly celebrated as the father of the American H-bomb but then subsequently responsible for much bad science, including Ronald Reagan's Star Wars. This book is very well researched and documented. One moral to draw: citizens must be involved with public policy. The former Soviet Union, undertaking a similar project, turned areas of Siberia so radioactive that it will not be safe to dwell there for 10,000 or more years. We almost did the same in Alaska--but thankfully did not. Read this book to (1) understand how this disaster was averted, and what we can do to continue to safeguard our democratic processes; and (2) for great--true--story."
5,They almost got away with exploding a nuclear bomb... in AK!,"This book is excellent! It's just mind-boggling to imagine that Teller and his boys (hence the title) almost got away with exploding a nuclear ""device"" near Kotzebue under the guise of creating a deep-water harbor... The absolute apathy and ignorance of many Interior Alaskans and the lap-dog behavior of many at the Univ. of Alaska Fairbanks and local media is really disappointing... A excellent read about a near disaster of our times (many of the characters are still alive and some still are involved at UAF, my alma mater)... Think Alaska is pristine and still pure? Think again... The heroes of this book, while many of them paying a great price, are given the attention they deserve in this piece of wonderful writing..."
4,Def Jux does it again,"C-Rayz blew this album open right from the intro. Only flaw to the album is that the 1st half is better than the 2nd, he could of finished a lil' stronger. Overall, the cd is of the bean curd rack. production is phenomonal as def jux albums always are & Walz is just a lyrical savage. The best tracks on the album are Floe, The Essence {a banga}, Buck 80, Battle Me & The posse cut The Line Up. If your a hip hop head and you aint got this album yet, Your SLEEPIN!!!!"
3,rayz the walz,"As with alot of other reviews you'll hear or read, i picked up on this cat from other underground joints that i had heard and thought he was nice with his. For those that are unfamiliar with him, his delivery is high pitched with some of the most intricate, intelligent, battle raps you're bound to hear in the same vein as Talib Kweli. Its a good honest, solid, straight forward refreshing piece of work, with a number of stand out tracks. Some of them are ""protect my family"", ""86"", ""buck 80"", and ""battle me"" (my personal favorite.) He is very familiar, both in sound and style to L.A. emcee MURS so if you like him you'll love this."
2,Still Looking for Something That Works,"The handle on this brush is sturdier than the Petco product, but that makes it harder to bend at the angles in the tubing I'm trying to clean. Also, the bristles aren't long/stiff enough to do any real cleaning. Haven't used it enough to know if the brush head breaks off as it does with the Petco product after too few uses."
5,Out In California,"Now I've listened to it...this cd is further proof that Dave is one of American Music's unheralded icons. Ther are no new tunes on this cd, but it does an excellent job of capturing his live show. Anyone who is (or is becoming) a Dave fan should also try to listen to any of Tom Russell's cd (except maybe The Man From God Knows Where - it's a good cd, but not really representative of Tom's writing or performing. Both Dave and Tom can and should be rated up wit the likes of Dylan when it comes to song writing (or storytelling with music). Another suggestion would be Chris Gaffney's cd El Vida Loca."
5,"Gotta read ""Humans"" if you like ""Coots"".","I bought my first book by these nuts, called ""Humans"" at a garage sale, and have been hooked ever since.If you think this one is good, you really should get ""Humans"" also.You will love it."
1,Why was this published?,"If you think Michael Jackson is a joke and all his success in the music field (and mostly ""Thriller"") was a fluke, you'd like this book. Reading this was like reading a book about all the tabloid reports about MJJ. It's filled with lies about his life and doesn't have any substantial evidence to back up its claims. For all those who think MJJ should be the joke of the industry, see if you can justify these two remarks with your sleazy trash about the King of Pop: one, why did Sony sign him to a 15 year $1 billion contract (and said they would stand by him in 1993), and second, there's no such thing as selling over 200 million albums (as a solo artist) and being called a fluke (he's in fact a shining example of pop music at its best). This book was just a waste of paper."
3,Crowded Travel Map,"This map is so crammed with details as to make it difficult to read at all. In many spots on the map, city and highway details are laid over geographical (mountain and such) details, rendering both unreadable. Additionally, a prospective buyer should note that this is a travel map, not a wall map, so it is printed on both sides (an especially irritating feature if one is trying to examine and area that falls on the bottom of the map, as you have to keep flipping the map over and back).On the positive side, the paper and printing are both high-quality, and the map is easy to refold.In sum, I purchased this map to use as a reference to some books on the subcontinent I had, and the two-sided nature and crowded details made it unsuitable to this task."
2,Beautiful but tiny and thus unusable,"This is a beautiful case. The leather is buttery soft. It also matches perfectly with the lining and leather of my Coach Chelsea handbag. However, the case is extremely small. With five business cards in each side of the case, it does not close properly. I'm not sure what this could really be used for effectively. Credit cards don't fit at all; they're too large for the sleeve.So, unfortunately, while it is gorgeous, I have yet to find a practical use for it due to the size."
1,over rated over stated career,aside from a couple of songs if tommorow never comes and the dance i just don't get the hype.i've listened and it has no feeling or soul to me great marketing genius though.i've heard all his records and i'm puzzled over all this love.
3,Treat Ball No Treat for Small Breed Dogs,The treat ball was much too big for my 13-pound dog to use. There needs to be a smaller model for small breed dogs.
1,Please do not waste your money,"I Loved these shoes sooooo much when they arrived that I turned around and bought another pair. Then she wore them. Nuf said! The entire front (toe area) is actually painted on so the paint wears off immediately. I mean, she wore them one time and I would never put them on her feet again. They look like they are 10 years old and she wore them once. I was sooooo dissapointed because they are sooooo cute!"
1,not a truthful story,"I knew Nino. He hung out with my aunt. He was a nice guy--interesting, funny and kind to children. However, I suspect that not much of ""The first one hundred years of Nino Cochise"" is true. No one will ever convince me that he was more than 80 or 85 when he died. He told my family that he was the GREAT grandson of Cochise. The story he told auntie was that he lost his leg in a stuntman job gone bad and had quite a tussle to get his employer to pay for it. In his later years he ran a little shop just outside of Tombstone. I don't know if he was related to Cochise or not, but that never mattered to me. I liked him alot and always enjoyed our visits. But reading this book made me sad.Nino, may the trail lead to sweet water on the Other Side."
2,Poor quality. Cheap price,"The seam near the waste came undone before I even wore one of the 3. Just washed them after I got them. Comfortable. First time trying this style. But I imagine like the hanes products that are sold dirt cheap they will stretch and elastic will be useless in no time at all. But I don't want to spend $15 for one pair of ""designer"" underwear. So...Update - if you don't like boxers you won't like these. There is no support. Nothing ""brief"" about them. Support is there for a minute. Take 3 steps and ...just dangle. Every time I sit down I feel like a nut cracker is being used...down there. Ouch!!!"
3,Good Boxer Briefs; Long in the Leg.,"Perfectly fine boxer briefs, and good colors, but the leg length is on the long side."
3,Nice printer but...,"I just got my 7760 last week and am still playing around with it. No complaints so far except for 1 annoying problem - 4x6 borderless photos are cropped by the printer. That is, the image you see in the software is not what you get - some of it gets chopped off. HP said this is the nautre of the printer - a small amount will be cropped when you print borderless. This does not happen when you print with borders. If you are a stickler, you will not be happy about this."
5,AWSOME!,MOH is the game I was looking for! the gameplay is awsome and the controls are easy. the multi player is the best! the weapons are great and the 1p is a good story. with all the difernt weapons to choose frome and the upgrades! I could go on and on.... if you like shooting games and have a gamecube this is the game for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,concerns about the Floopy Sleep Game,"While the narrative is soothing and the music is lovely, I have a basic concern with the guided visualization used on this tape. Living on a lake and having Grandsons overnight with us frequently, I am returning this tape because of the encouragement to visualize walking down to the river and getting atop a turtle and smoothly floating on...In that we carefully insruct the two small boys to NEVER go to the lake without an adult, it is not helpful to suggest that it is okay to walk down to the ""river"" alone and quietly. The relaxation techniques are nice and the music pleasant but the verbage is harmful to younger children"
3,Cross lighter holder buckle,"It's a cool idea but its very big, too big for me. It sticks out because the lighter has to fit, but overall it's pretty cool."
2,Only for Leather,"This hole punch said it worked on soft fabric. It DID NOT WORK ON FABRIC! But, if you are only into leather, this is the tool for you, great for punching holes in belts."
2,Buy something else,"This is the cheapest hand punch you can buy, and you shouldn't. The handles are made from formed sheet steel -- the razor sharp edges from fabrication have not been removed. If you buy or own one, smooth down those edges with a file or a knife steel, or you're going to bleed at an inconvenient time. The punches themselves are not removable and rotate into place. This wouldn't be bad if it was only for occasional use, but the punches are not 90 degrees and flush to the brass anvil on mine and therefore it doesn't punch clean holes, you have to clean out the scrap with a knife. If Chinese leather workers actually have to use this tool, I feel very sorry for them.Summary: Spend a little more for a decent punch. Don't buy a PSO (punch shaped object)."
2,Not so much funk on this disc,"I bought this title hoping for a majority of head bobbing, hip wiggling, hard core funk.Unfortunately only about 3 of the 7 tracks really get down on it, the remainder being the standard 70's soul ballads.It's all good, but 70's soul ballads are not my cup of tea. The funk that does get rolling -- especially FOPP -- is out and out, dead on, groove in, funk."
3,Put's the UP in Downtempo,"What's that you say? There is no ""Up"" in downtempo? Well now I know we're on the same page. I purchased this album believing that I was going to get more of the masterful production from the duo behind some of the mellowest, hauntingly beautiful, music ever produced (but I'm not one for hyperbole ;-) What I got instead was a pretty decent, dancey-club album. What happened Bent? Stick to what you know--chilled out ethereal music, not rocking the house."
2,Fun But Small,"I like this potty because it's creative, something attractive to toddlers. My son likes to pee on it. It's a pretty small potty. I am lucky my son is small and fits on it. Any average or bigger toddler would not fit on it. I wish it had an easier dumping feature. When you pee or poop in it, there's no pouring cup to get it out. They pee or poop right in it so you have to flip the whole thing upside down to dump it into the toilet. So I guess there's more clean up involved each time your toddler goes potty on it."
5,Works as promised,"Extra roomy, I store the griddle in there as well.It is well contructed, should last for years.I am conpletely satisfied."
5,Excellent!,"Frankie J has done it again, except this time is just perfect. This is an album that I'd definitely keep playing over and over again. There hasn't been a track I've had to skipped. For any Frankie J fans, or anyone just interested in him, this is one album you must purchase. Excellent job from Frankie J!"
2,'What's A Man To Do?' was much better,"I loved his 2003 CD, 'What's a Man to Do?' The man has a wonderful voice. In my opinion, he's the Latin Usher. But with this current CD, it seems he's trying too hard to come across as hip hop. Too many hip hop flavored songs. His strength is his voice so he should stick to singing R & B and slow jams. I can only count 4 songs that truly met that criteria on the CD. And what's up with the 4 bonus tracks? I didn't like the fact that only 10 songs were actually new. Then 2 of the bonus tracks were 'Obsession' as a Reggaeton mix (which I liked) and a Spanish Version. Then 'Don't Wanna Try' is there, for some reason. We know that was your most successful track Frankie but come on. It's like he put it there for those that didn't remember or something. And 'Suga Suga' is not even his song. It's Baby Bash's song, Frankie just sings the hook.Bottom line: not all that impressed with the CD. There were some good songs but his 2003 CD was MUCH better."
1,This album was pretty pathetic!,"The best thing Howard could've done was go solo. After all, when Jody Watley left, that was pretty much the beginning of the end for this group. Their last good album was ""The Look"", which featured the two jamming tracks ""You're the One and Over and Over""."
4,Great Mag for Pizzeria Owners - but even better when it is free,As much as I love Amazon.com I can't let you pay $44+ for this magazine. Yes it is a must have for the pizzeria owners (and those thinking of joining the biz) but don't buy it. Go to the PizzaToday.com website and subscribe for free.
4,what does a bag of marbles have to do with the story?,"A bag of marbles was pretty good. If you are looking for an educational book about wwII and want to escape the gore, this is the book for you. It gets a little slow, but you really do find yourself caring for theses two boys. Plus, it is non-fiction."
5,An excellent view of society and political theory.,"I would strongly recommend that you begin reading this book with the intention of finishing. At a few points you may need to just stick to it and wade through, BUT IT IS WORTH IT! In my opinion, Tolstoy wrote this book with the intent to explain a point rather than to just entertain. He is very thorough in explaining his ideas and it proves to be very interesting. I especially enjoyed following Pierre's story! Good Luck!"
3,Win the battle but lose the War,"I picked this book up as a challenge to myself due to its length. I thought I would stick with it no matter what. Surprisingly I became involved in the story, and found it very interesting. I thought the Russian language was a little hard, but from the context I was able to draw the meanings for most words. What I found difficult was the French, there would be whole responses, several sentences long, which I would have no clue what was said. The story reveals how even wealthy, powerful people may seem to have it made, but they too can have problems and troubles like all people. What I will always remember about War and Peace is that it concretely illustrates the old saying, ""You can win the battle, but lose the war."""
5,Mr.,Good products may save your life in case of a big disaster. You should leave this box in your car not in your home.
4,Great backup to keep in your car.,The product was shipped undamaged and unexpired. The water and food are no older then 2 months when I received them with a 5 year life span. The water bags say you need to drink 4 bags to maintain hydration but the box only contains 6 water bags. The box says for 3 day use for 1 person but then shouldn't there be 12 water bags?
4,not too shabby,received it very quickly. not much water but all in date. def good to keep in the car. great for the price
1,Pena ajena,"Lots of Hollywood stars attend this Cantinflas funeral. IT'S DREADFUL! If you haven't seen any Cantinflas movie please don't see this one, or you'll never understand why this genius was once considered by Chaplin ""the funniest man alive""."
4,Dickens,I first read this nearly 50 years ago and loved it. I enjoyed it this time too. It was written in a time when writing styles were very different and at times it seemed a little slow. At the same time it was an education and with Dickens you can always get lost in a different time and place.
4,Charles Dicken's fictional autobiography David Copperfield,"This book was well written by one of the greatest author's of all time. In writing of the life of David Copperfield, Dickens incorporates events that happened in his own life. Because it was written in the Victorian era, it may seem to flowery at times, and somewhat unbelievable because of all the coincidences that happen, but it was fun to read if you have time to pour over the 800+ pages."
2,David Copperfield,"""David Copperfield""By,Charles DickensThe book should be read by the people who may/may not like the nonfiction types of books. The book that I have chosen to read was called ""David Copperfield"". David Copperfield had been a young boy who in some way an abandoned child. David's father died six months before David was even born. So his mother hired a lady named Peggotty, she was a main character in the book. David's mother then married a man called Mr. Murdstone who David did not like but lived with. Later in the book David's mother and older brother had died so then David had to live in a house with Peggotty and Mr. Murdstone. Mr. Murdstone wasn't talked about much because David did not like him, he was real mean to David. Although David was sad about his mother dead he had managed to get on with his life.I thought that this had an all right beginning with a confusing end. I rated this book a two because I was not all that interested in it."
1,BORING!!,I was forced to read this book my freshman year of high school. It is so boring. How can people say Charles Dickens was a great writer. He was an old ugly misogynist. He makes most of the female characters mean or dumb and weak. Also this book and Great Expectations are basically the same.
3,Tribute to Trio Lescano,"Amazon's labeling of this CD is backward: the group is ""Delizioso"" and ""Italian Swing Sisters"" is the title of the CD. The title is a reference to Trio Lescano, a legendary Italian vocal group in the style of the Andrews Sisters who were persecuted in fascist Italy because of their Jewish ancestry.The performances here are competent if uninspired. If nothing else, Delizioso deserves credit for reviving Trio Lescano's repertoire. If you like the Andrews Sisters, give this disc a try."
3,delivery,"Delivery was promised overnight. However, delivery took a week. Not very happy with seller and would not purchase another item."
5,"Many Helpful details, recipes, and more","I got a lot of practical information and assistance from this book. Dr. St. Amand tells it like it is about Fibromyalgia, which I've had most of my life. What a refreshing change to find a doctor that doesn't blame Fibro on the patient. I've had the fatigue and believe me, these suggestions work! A great book."
4,Fibromyalgia,The book is very informational. I found the information about hypoglycemia was very helpful. The two diet plans are easy to follow. I've had improvement already! Thanks.
4,"Classic ""Dan""","Many people panned this album when it was released. Don't believe it for one minute. Gaucho is an excellent album. ""My Rival"" and ""Gaucho"" are my favorite cuts. Steely Dan will always release great music, but if you don't include Gaucho in your collection, you'll be missing out on a great piece of music!"
3,The CD that ushered in a creative break,"Fagen and Becker decided to take a twenty year hiatus after this effort, at least as a duo. Donald Fagen did some impressive solo work, and Becker did some producing, but it is easy to see why the two felt it necessary to take five... or twenty.Although this is a good CD, it is probably their weakest offering, with their comeback CDs recapturing the magic that was the hallmark of all Dan recordings from the seventies. "" Babylon Sisters"" and the FM radio staple "" Hey Nineteen"" are alternately cautionary and fun, but the rest of the CD tilts a little too far toward lounge act jazz. "" Time Out of Mind"" is uncharacterstic in its upbeat tone, but it somehow works. No Dan fan should be without this CD, but pick up the rest of the collection first."
5,NO STONE EAR PEOPLE ALLOWED,"As a person who listens to music as carefully as a wine critic evaluates a glass of wine, I find this DTS disc brings forth a musical flavor that could only be replicated with the use of perhaps a ( Carver Sonic Hologram Projector ) unit or something in that caliber of sterio gear. Yes, the sound is dramatic and even true hardcore Steely Dan listeners will find a new reason to listen to this release even more often! You may ask, how could S/D get any better? Give this disc a listen, and your heart and soul will sing!"
2,"Hey Nineteen, that's about it","""Hey Ninteen"" is a great track, and ""Babylon Sisters"" rocks, but the whole thing sounds like the Dan on auto-pilot and, though it is a bit tiresome to judge records this way, doesn't come close to mid-70's classics like Countdown to Ecstasy and Katy Leid. The middle sction drags, and its a chore to listen straight through, even though the album only runs to 38 mintes. Still, ""Hey Nineteen"" is one killer tune. ""The Cuervo Gold/ The fine columbian/ Make tonight a wonderful thing."" Indeed, but read between the lines and this is as unsettling a song as the band ever wrote. It belongs elsewhere, apart from the remainder of an insipid record."
1,Pavarotti & Friends - For War Child,I was very disapointed in this purchse. My daughter in-law showed me how to buy from Amazon. When she bought this for me it did not say it was going to take a long time to be delivered to me and it did not say made in UK. after i received it I tried to use it but it would not work. It was several weeks befor I could get someone to help me look at what was wrong. I took it to a shop and they tried it and it would only play audio and at this time it was too late to return it. Im note sure if I will make any more purchaces again.
1,Jackie Robinson? Wasn't he what happened in 1947?,"Red Barber has lot of anecdotes on baseball. A lot. Barber sat on the front row when Jackie Robinson was put forward to be the first black man in baseball by Branch Rickey, he was the Dodgers' broadcaster at the time. He knows a lot. Het lets us know he knows a lot. But Red Barber is not a writer. And no historian, for that matter. It just seems that this book is a transcript of Barber speaking into a recording device. Stories pop up twice, there is no clear line of events and thus, despite Robinson being the greatest, however long overdue thing that happened to baseball, no buildup to this great occasion. Jackie Robinson is just a sideline in this book, that even has Robinson on the cover. A wasted opportunity, I think."
5,Best Since DK?,"I got turned on to DK in the late 80's, and never got to see them live, but they've always been my favorite punk band. I didn't get into Lard much, and lost touch with Biafra's output since then. I love the Melvyns, though, so I got this - it completely rocks.It sounds more like Biafra's album than the Melvyns, but the Melvyn's are so muscular (Rutmanis on bass has been and continues to be a huge addition to the band) that they really bring the songs to a very high quality level, and Biafra's vocals are to Punk what Easy E's were to RAP.Great album."
4,Entertaining,"Being a huge fan I'm a little bit bias, I was looking for some spoken word. Never the less I did enjoy it."
4,Why are they not bigger????,I don't understand why this band has not gotten more attention and fame. Well for that matter I don't understand why Suede didn't either. I always found Suede to be one of the better brit rock bands around.I am glad that the team is back for this. It's not Dog Man Star but what is really? This is a great cd. It's much more poppy and mainstream than even the last Suede disc but that's no reason not to like it. It even get's better with repeated listens. I think there are at least 3 singles that are worthy of mainstream radio.All I can say is that if you liked Suede's later releases then you will enjoy this.
4,"How-to general reference, well illustrated","Demonstrates in full color, step-by-step photographs all stages of making and decorating frames and mounts. This useful and well designed book is an encyclodedic introduction to picture framing crafts. It offers comprehensive descriptions of equipment for both beginning and advanced techniques and explains a wide range of decorative effects, from wood and paint finishes to gilding. It gives advice on how to restore and repair frames and includes an inspiring creative gallery of finished frames by professional artists."
5,The Will of God as a Way of Life,"This book about life was enlightening, captivating, down-to-earth, helpful, inspirational, and so much more. It helped me through my life experiences at the time I read it. It has helped me since as I go back to read parts of it over and over. It was life changing. When you are in the crooked places of life (which is more often than we would like it to be), we know God is there but Jerry Sittser does a beautiful job of reminding us of this truth."
5,Man for all times,"Super researched book about a true industrial hero. An amazing career with very little mentor assistance, but what there was was understood and put into Chryslers daily plan. His skill set is rare and continues to be rare today. I'm confident that were he around today, Chrysler would still be Chrysler. This book doesn't leave any significant questions unanswered. Bravo!"
4,Biography by repetition,"Vincent Curcio opens his biography of Walter Chrysler with an admission that he did not set out to accomplish the comprehensive work the book became. He discovered a lack of published material about the automaker and decided to fill the gap; his book is a success thanks, in part, to adoring fans Walter Chrysler left in his wake, people who, like Curcio, decided that something had to be done to preserve the memory of this great man. Curcio's technique is unusual in one regard: the deliberate (it HAS to be deliberate) repetition of anecdotes, quotes and information. Whole passages are repeated chapters after you first read them, without any acknowledgement by the author that he already has cited this material. It's as though the author's note cards were scrambled and the same ones picked up more than once. I would like to think Curcio had some good reason for this; the occasional typos that also mar the book make me wonder. Where was the editor?"
2,Too hard for little ones,"We bought this toy for my 3 year old who LOVES farm animals. He has other matching games that he loves, so we thought he would enjoy this one. But, it's been way too difficult for him.First, to play the board game itself, the rules are too complicated for him. Then, the physical part of joining the animals together is tough for his little hands.We've been playing our own version so we can try to get our money's worth out of the game. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you have an older child who is patient enough to follow directions and has better fine motor skills.I think a better game for little ones would be one I bought that comes in an egg crate. It only has two parts so it's easier to match. Sorry-I can't remember the name or brand."
1,"like Scooby Doo, but worse","This book read like a Scooby Doo mystery ""And it would have worked to, if it weren't for those darn kids!""Nothing happened in this book, nothing at all. You'll wonder why this book wasn't 5 pages long instead of 100+. It also is 3rd person instead of 1st person which is not a turn for the better. We don't get any of Vlad's usual sarcasm and wit.Definately the weakest book in the series."
5,Missing one song,"This is a very easy album to hear. I do wish ""Old Black Joe"" had been included. It is such a mournful song.I read somewhere the short lifetime of Steven Foster's earned him about $15,000.00 for his song writing!"
3,Size isn't correct,I got these shoes for my 2 y/o daughter who wears an 8 1/2. I got the large because it said it was an 8/9. It's more of a 9/10. They're really big on her. I thought she could wear them on the shores of a lake but they're too loose. We cinch them tighter so she can wear them on a stable surface for now but she'll get more use out of them when her foot grows a little bigger.
4,Great Little Pool Shoe,"Bought these for our 15 month old daughter to play at the pool and not slip on the cement. These were great - easy to put on and our daughter loved them. However, the adjustable elastic to hold them onto her foot pulled right out after only wearing a short while. Thankfully, we received a replacement but was disappointed with the initial pair breaking."
4,Water Shoes,"These water shoes run a little large, Our grandson wears a size 8, so these 8-9's are a bit big on him. They go on easily and the drawstring top tightens them up fine. I do wish the botton was just a bit more grippy, but they serve the purspose and protect his feet around the pool. The colors are bright and they are well made enough for the price."
4,Beach Shoes,"I ordered these shoes for a three year old who loves the ocean. She has enjoyed her ""beach shoes,"" finding them very ""comfy;"" they are sufficiently tough to withstand salt water, chlorinated pool water, sand, and rocky shores without falling apart. I shall get another pair for her next summer. The reason I didn't give a 5-Star rating is that there is still a month-plus left to the summer--if they're still in great shape by September, I'll upgrade!"
1,Literature????,"I started reading one of these Philip Dick books for a few reasons. First, all of the great reviews. Second, I like the concept of stories based on ""what if history turned out different"". It is an interesting speculation. Third, the price was right (i.e. $1). I started reading them and the writing is simply pure garbage. The stories are disjointed and you can't tell where the writer is going for many pages at a time. The characters are ugly and very forgettable. For the life of me I can understand why people love this writer so much. Perhaps they are all on drugs while they are reading this stuff which is apparently, what the author was doing at the time he was writing."
3,Punk?,"""Punk Rock Aerobics"" is great for ladies who know little about punk or exercise. The pictures and directions of the ""killer moves"" are easy to follow, but the girls' ""punk"" costumes are, if anything, distracting and comical. The ""50 Punk Classics"" leave MUCH to be desired...leaving out many crucial punk bands and including mediocre music and non-punk (Devo?). The book, does, however, include a short list of some good punk movies, likeSuburbiaandSid & Nancyand some helpful motivators to get up and exercise (including solutions to common problems + obstacles faced by women on the road to fitness). However, I think I might get more of a workout riding my bike to the beer distributor."
4,"Shove, love","Never heard of him before. Read one article, read first book, craved more and dug in. Nuff said. Interesting to read gritty crime fiction from England. Highly recommend you read at least this one. Not sure if the last in the series is everyone's cup of tay, but you can figure that out on your own."
2,THIS MY FEELINGS ABOUT THIS BOOK!!!!,"This was my first time reading one of Tracy's books , I didn't care for it much at all. The back of the cover stated it is a must-read, can't-put-down. HUH. I found this to be the opposite for me. It took me quite a while to read , when I put it down it was a real- effort -to pick -it -back -up. I found it to be drawn out and all over the place and not a nice flow. The storyline was cool but the delivery of it could use a bit of work. I am willing to give this author another shot despite all this because it probably just wasn't for me but it is reality."
4,DIS IS DA SHEEEEET,Seroiusly i just finshed this book i started yesterday and i have to say i loved it. Though i wasnt surpised about how drastic the outcome was gonna be.... But overall Tracy did her thing!
2,Underwhelmed,"This movie was not what it was cracked up to be. It was in fact cliche and predictable, but worse yet, NOT SCARY. If anything it was irritating. These little creatures I guess are supposed to be super strong or something but if these things are coming at you, I think you'd put up more of a fight than the characters in this movie. I mean make me feel you're at least trying to survive. It's like a grown-up letting a 3 year old beat him/her up on purpose. That's what this felt like to me. The only thing I got into was the relationship developing between the little girl and her soon-to-be stepmother played by Katie Holmes. And then to piss me off more, Holmes' character, who was my favorite in the movie, 'dies' or is turned into one of those stupid little freaks. Blah! Not for me."
4,Not bad,"I am a horror movie kind of girl and though this film had a great angle I thought the actual ""fairies"" they used took something away from the horror of the film. Otherwise not a bad film with the classic ending that makes a horror movie just that. Can't save them all."
2,Be Afraid of this Movie,I seriously considered calling Amazon and asking for my three bucks back on this one. All the excitement takes place in the first five minutes and the last five. You can fast forward the rest and you would not have missed a thing. I really think it's weird Del Toro put his name on this. This could not have been a preview before Pan's Labyrinth.
3,"A tepid remake, but with some surprising scares!","I'm not a huge fan of remakes. I didn't like when they remadeLet the Right One In (English Subtitled). I didn't like when they remadeManhunter. I didn't like when they remadeBeing Human. No, not a big fan of remakes.This one makes the common remake mistakes of explaining too much, showing too much with their new whiz-bang CGI, and delivering flat characters ...... yet despite all that, there are some genuine scares to be had in this movie. It starts out very slowly, looks like it's going to be a non-starter, and then before you realize it, there are some scenes that just scare the ever-loving piss out of you!I can't really bring myself to recommend this remake with any enthusiasm. It just didn't need to be made, or if it did, it could have been made better. That said, it could also have been made much, much worse. I suppose it's worth a watch if you can't find anything better on tonight."
3,Painfully predictable,The obvious parts from the trailer are creepy but its like come on already come on already the whole movie.
4,"Good, not great, but scary!","SPOILER!!!!! I just got done watching this movie and I found it to be scary! Granted, by showing the creatures so early, it took a lot of the scary edge off the movie! So, the movie could have been much scarier, but the creatures were still evil enough to be scary! I just wish they didn't look like evil rats or gremlins. Still, I enjoyed the movie and found myself scared about what was going to happen next."
2,Oh boy were do we even start with this one.,"How can you sum up this movie? Well... it's about a little girl (who looks like Anne Ramsey) that is sent to live with her father because her mother wants to enjoy the single like. Young Anne Ramsey is forced to live in a spookie house now with her father and his girlfriend Who was ""supposed to be young but she's not she's old"". As young Anne Ramsey finds herself adapting to life in her new house and her new ""unmedicated"" life. In doing so she starts to hear voices coming from the basement ""Creepy voices btw"". Come play with us ""Young Anne Ramsey"" the voices say. Then the ridiculous movie takes you from one chuckling to flat out laughing by the time it's over.This is a remake of an older horror movie by the same name. As remakes usually go 90% of the time they're never as good as the original. I don't recall ever seeing the original film but this movie does feel like a remake."
4,getr ready for the truth,"It's wonderful to see some one who feels as I do, and who is willing to tell it like it is. We as a people need to stop defining our selves as a race and more as individuals who are growing. The only way we can grow as a people is to grow as individuals and then each one can teach one, not how to be black but how to live in harmony with everyone, whether they be black white asian indian or hispanic. We are all americans and we need to to unite as one. Thank you Rev Petterson for your willingness to stand where others dare not in in the cross hairs of the race peddlers, I join you in spirit and I feel confident in calling you brother as I do with any one (regardless of race) who speaks the truth."
3,WOW!,"Wow this is a crazy but awesome CD!!! It has a lot of good sounds if your in to all that, but don't buy this CD if your a hard rocker. These cats purr and you hear nice music. Its great for a day in your garden during the summer to just chill out."
4,"A result, if not quite a full belly","Aylett's biographical study of the notorious pulp author Jeff Lint is a teasingly exquisite piece. It takes your hand, leads you into the tire-kicking world of the much-maligned writer and shows you so many tantalising insights into his life. I loved it but it left me wanting so much more. What colour were the velvet swatches held by Lint and Herzog in the freezing lot? How high were Herzog's graph paper barricades? What shape were the gnostic knobs Lint manipulated without effect? Did Lint favour short of fuller length gowns when submitting his work? These questions remain unanswered, simply, I suspect, because the author was perplexed by a cloud of choking black dust. But these omissions are flawless fragments of a larger picture. Overall this is a fascinating examination of an underrated mind, written with panache and clandestine mundanity. A must-read for all Lint fans."
1,"Book was moldy, had to throw it away.","Book was moldy, had to throw it away.Book was moldy, had to throw it away.Book was moldy, had to throw it away."
1,"Revolutionary product, But Shinei is a terrible company","The go-vox is distributed by Landware but produced by Shinei, a Singapore based company. I have Palm IIIc and decided to shop on Shinei's on-line shop since they sell a product specifically for the IIIC. What a mistake. I purchased the product on 19 Jan 01, my credit card charged on 5 Feb 01. I still have not recieved the product. I have sent many e-mails to Shinei requesting assistance but have only received one response in more than 2 months stating that they may have problems shipping the product. I have sent 3 e-mail addresses to contact me and 2 mailing addresses.I would definitely stay away from this product."
1,WARNING Pirated music,WARNINGI purchased this CD collection and upon opening it I discovered that the disks were copies that said on them for demonstration only not to be sold.Music is OK
2,non replaceable battery,"I ran across this while looking for a replacement for it. This unit just died on my wife during a power outage during thunderstorms. It would light up while cranking but would not hold a charge. I took it apart (4 screws) to see if the battery could be replaced. There are 4 internal gears that enthusiastically fall out when you take it apart. There is a lithium battery that could be replaced if they had just designed it better. The battery is hot glued down! Since it looked like such an effort to break the hot glue and get the gears back in place, we just threw it away and I will buy a different light. It did last a few years before the battery died though."
5,So much better than I thought!!,"I purchased the Clarisonic (AMAZING product by the way) Philosophy which had a small bottle of this body wash. I was not expecting anything worth writing a review about (especially since it was not a purposeful purchase). I was wrong!! This was VERY luxurious, and it smells INCREDIBLE!!! I felt so feminine with the fragrance!! It is a subtle, yet pretty scent. I have not used this enough to tell if it is drying, but I do not think it is so far. I think I am going to start using this from now on."
3,"""Wind Song""","I finally ordered this product after being tempted for years based on its reviews. It is a nice fragrance - but it reminds me of another perfume ""Windsong"" (which is a lot cheaper)."
2,Awful,No scent at all. Very very disappointing. I was so excited to buy such a large bottle but what a waste of money! Don't waste your time until they stop making cheap products. Seriously what happened to this company???!!!
2,Overall opinion: Not worth the $$ (sorry Philosophy!),"I love the smell, but it DOES NOT 'stick'. It smelt it nicely when I shampooed, or, when it was in higher concentration, but I could not smell it otherwise. Plus, it is not moisturizing. So, I will continue to use it as a shampoo, but not a body wash. My hair looked nice today, so I can't complain about it's shampooing performance. But, since I paid what I paid for it, I am disappointed. I wish it had a more potent, long-lasting smell, and, I wish it was moisturizing."
2,Smelled great at first,"I loved the smell of the Amazing Grace shower gel... but about 1/3 rd into the bottle, all of a sudden I noticed the scent of the gel didn't smell like it did when I first bought it. It's almost like it lost scent or something. At first I thought it was just me, like maybe I was used to it or something. But this has never happened before on other scented products. My hubby sniffed it but he said it didn't smell very strong either.Anyway, I'm still using the rest of the bottle but won't be purchasing this one again."
1,Hair fell out!!!!!!!,Do not buy this shampoo under any circumstance!!!! I used the shampoo a few days ago and it made my hair so dry. My scalp was itching and my hair felt so coarse. My mother used the same bottle of shampoo a few days later and her hair started falling out in clumps. It fell out so much that she started having small bald spots! Do not use this shampoo.
1,BOOOOOORING!!,"Independant does not make you good. Underground does not make you good. Different does not make you good. Something has happened between the golden age of rap and now where there are two extremes. The ultra gangsta and the pseudo intelligent/lyrical. In the golden era, every rapper was distinguishable by voice, cadence, and delivery. Company flow is just another group of battle rappers with nothing but lame punchlines and boring as hell beats. There is nothing innovative about this album. Just because it was different at the time of its release does not make it great. If you want innovative rap that actually has a personality peep DELTRON 3030 with Del and Dan the Automator and anything by MF Doom. They are the truth. This is just some... hell I don't know what to call it but a cure for insomnia."
2,This was the most tedious book i've ever read.,Beowulf is the enbodyment of everthing I can't stand in a male. He is arrogant and vain. It is completely unnecesary to announce every person's linage every time a person is spoken of. YUCK!!!!!! The memories in the middle of an action are distracting and annoying. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because I like dragons.
1,This must have been a punishment or something,"This book had to be a bad joke or a cruel punishment. I was forced to read this for a British lit class and let me tell you it was money wasted. I continue to be amazed at the belief that just because something is written by the British then that in itself makes it a classic and a must read. We freed ourselves from the British government through war and struggle. What do we have to do to free ourselves from their literature, becuase other than The Cantebury Tales and a few poems and epitaphs, British lit is long, boring, tedious and outdated. Not to mention some of the language is unbearable, I find myself having to re-read passages just to understand them. Please free the college undergrads of the world."
1,If you enjoy torturing yourself then Beowulf is for you.,"Lucky for Burton Raffel, Amazon requires me to give this work at least 1 star. This version doesn't even deserve that. I have to admit that Beowulf is by far THE WORST work of recognized literary merit that I have EVER encountered. The story centers around a most egotistical, self-glorifying man, Beowulf. The reader must endure pages and pages of Beowulf's constant bragging and babbling about his numerous ""brave"" feats. The only part of the story I enjoyed was at the very end when Beowulf gets killed by a fire breathing dragon. Fortunately, this is a very short book because if it had even been one page longer I would have had to resort to a slow, painful suicide (which would have been more interesting than ""Beowulf""). I promise you will hate this version of Beowulf and you will regret every second of your life you spend reading it. If you are required to read this work, I strongly suggest you skip the ""epic poem"" and read the Spark Notes END"
4,An enjoyable experience,"I enjoyed this book/poem? very much. I will say, however, that I wouldn't have enjoyed it had I been forced to read it in school. <smile> You have to accept the book for what it is, and not what your twentieth century mind wants it to be. I didn't like that it named a sword but didn't consider a slave worthy of being counted as a person, but being that it was a reflection of those times, I tried not to judge it too harshly. Some of the lines were downright lyrical, others were hard to understand, but I thought Mr. Raffel did an excellent job of translating the story.I will refer back to certain passages again, though it's not a book I'll read over and over."
5,For the AARP Generation!,"Being somewhat intimidated by the digital world, I was somewhat apprehensive about purchasing my first digital camera. I finally decided on the Canon Powershot A10 after a bit of research.I couldn't be more pleased! This camera is perfect for people such as myself.It's not complicated AT ALL! The software is SIMPLE to install. The camera is a BREEZE to operate. The photos are BEAUTIFUL!Within an hour of opening the box and installing the software, I e-mailed some GREAT photos to my kids!If you are thinking about a digital camera - then this is THE ONE for first time buyers and users!"
5,The Art of Richard Dieberkorn,Good book at an excellent price. It is worth it. Good pictures. Reading a little bit heavy.
5,"A poetic collection, beautifully sung","I consider this to be one of the best collection of De Andre's songs. The melodies are lovely, he has a wonderful voice, and the texts are original and quite poetic. One only wishes more of his records were available."
2,"Bad, but Oddly Pleasing","I don't recomend this movie. The production value is low. The acting is bad. And most frustratingly, the dialogue isn't bad enough to make it funny, but bad enough to bother me.That aside, there is some very strange stuff going on in this movie that I do not regret seeing. The laughs are sparse in this film. But when I am laughing, it is at things I have never seen.The zombie violence is pretty gross too! Not bad for the low production value. The action though, is horribly repetitive. This is not that kind of zombie film. This is more of an interplay between characters which mostly takes place in a house.The zombies are of the old-school variety. Moving slowly. But they aren't what the show is about. The show is about a swinging couple and the people they abduct, who don't have much of a problem banging some dude's wife.Don't worry, it's not softcore porn. It's a comedy with bad taste and bad timing and a weird imagination."
1,bad bad movie,"This was a really really bad movie. The acting was horrible, the special effects were pathetic and the plot was not worth writing about. Really bad movie.Plot: Matool (a clear reference to Zombi 2), who kills zombies, is kidnapped by a guy because his wife wants to use him for sex. This open marriage relationship goes to the extreme, and if you have the bad fortune of watching this movie, you will know why. They also have to deal with the zombies.The movie is really just bad and the acting is worse than terrible. The dialogue is pointless and the film is just a waste of time. Words can not describe just how bad this movie is. I would rank it right up with ""Zombie Nation"" in how just how horrible it is."
3,Zombies & kinky sex don't mix,"I bought this DVD figuring it would be another good old Zombie flick to add to my library but when the kinky sex scenes appeared, I was yawning. This movie would have gotten a higher rating if it weren't for those kinky sex scenes. If you don't mind the kinky sex, you'll might like this movie. The zombies all looked low budget, and the blood looks like scarlet tempra paint. But there is plenty of gore ( in a low budget way) in this movie To me, kinky sex, and zombies just don't mix, but that's my opinion."
1,cute but fell apart,"Bought these for my bridesmaids 3 years ago, a month before my wedding. It didn't even last a month!!! None of them made it to the wedding. The actual flower didn't stay onto the pin. Cute but not really something I would order again!"
5,Fun and different.,"I like this book because it is a different and fun story. It is completely silly, but in a good way. I think four to seven year olds will really enjoy it and parents will not be bored reading this with their kids. (Would also be great in the classroom)"
5,Cute book!,"Fun book when discussing folklore--the kids I read it to (7 and 8 years old) really liked it. They immediately tied it to Pinocchio. Written in a fun way with the narrator (an armadillo) using rhyming side bars to keep the story going. Wonderful illustrations, too!"
4,A terrific poet and singer,This man is an undiscovered treasure. His lyrics are pure poetry. And his music is quite good. I've also heard others sing his songs and its always impressive. This is an album worth having!
3,The Perfect Race,Intersting history of athletics careers of Coe and Ovett. Life is tough even for champions
4,A wonderful look at a year through the Orthodox faith,As a former evangelical protestant now preparing for chrismation within the Church of the East I very much enjoyed Frederica Mathewes-Greens account of a year within their mission church. It helped to focus me on the timeless practices of the church.
1,PyriteEye,"Game is horrid.Multiplayer is only fun thats because its 50% game, 50% LOLing @ how much the game sucks."
3,This game is atleast better than a lot of others for the DS.,"Okay, bottom line:- its a fun game to play with your friends-the one player mode is kind of hard and really really short though has good replay value to try to beat a level faster etc.- the graphics are all pretty good-the story line just sux-after dying a few times in one player i just quit and then came back the next day wanting to play it all the more-again, way too short-VERY VERY VERY addictive multiplayer (only if there are 4 or more people playing together.)-sound is nothing special too some people, but for once i liked it pretty simpleJUST BUY IT- its not too much money."
3,Enjoyable show...,"This is the type of show that is enjoyable to watch. It is not fantastic, so no 5 stars here, but easily 3 star rated."
4,No problems + HPNA 2.0 + cross-platform = Very Nice,"I've been running a home network with the Netgear HPNA 2.0 <-> Ethernet bridge for a few months now and have had no problems (I've heard that other bridges have some problems with certain routers/firewalls). Since Broadcom hasn't released specs for their HPNA 2.0 chipset (Bad monkeys! Bad, bad monkeys!) and so no Linux drivers exist for HPNA 2.0 NICs, this may be as close as non-Windows users get to 10 Mb/sec HPNA bliss. Currently my Netgear PE102 is attached to a 10 Mb hub that contains a Win98 box and a Linux firewall, so now I can attach to the Internet/LAN using my laptop anywhere in the house (with a Linksys PCM100H1 PC Card). Quite nice. Only problem is the price tag, especially since Ethernet NICs are cheap."
3,"The book is great, the shipping was not so great!","This book was a gift for my husband and he liked it, it's a great book. I can't give it five stars because the book came unwraped and the cover was dirty (I had to clean it with rubbing alchool). After that my husband discovered a black marker line on the side of the book, something I didn't notice when it arrived. I think books should be handled with much more care and at least be wraped in a plastic before beeing put in the box. Thanks!"
2,Absolutely beautiful for TWO WHOLE DAYS,"when this arrived, I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. The gems were small but glistening. The silver nice and thick. The clasp was nice. However, after two day's of wear, I looked down and noticed several of the stones were missing. I ordered a replacement, and will update this review after I wear the new one for a couple of weeks."
3,Good quality......a little too bulky though.,"Monster THXIMINI8 THX Certified 1/8 Stereo to Stereo RCA Cable AdapterI bought this cable as a means to connect my M-Audio AV-40's to my pc. I made the error of not correctly measuring the length, which was my error. Of course, good ol' Amazon is taking them back.....The signal quality for this cable is great, but you would be better off using it for a tow-strap. I overlooked and or didn't pay close enough attention to other reviews describing this problem. If you have any other connections anywhere close to your speaker input connection, the 3.5mm head of this cable will interfere. The RCA heads are kind of HUGE also, baraly fitting into a standard set of sockets next to each other. Use a straight 3.5 end non-monster sized...Sorry monster:("
4,Good quality cables,"These cables are very well built. There is only a problem. I purchased it to connect on my computer sound blaster, but they don't fit due to the large and wide connector. So, if you don't have much space between your connections, avoid these cables. Otherwise, they are very good."
5,What else can you say about Monster,"Cables work great! The last Y cables I purchased were Radioshack brand and they were not weak or flimsy, the coating of the wire was a lil thick. After about a year the Radioshack Y cable had to be moved around near the connetions on the receiver because i was losing sound in the right channel. This is very frustrating for someone who has a surround sound. I chose Monster because of the repuation and the very chick coating in their wires. I was looking for durability and quality as all ""audiophiles"" should. Anyways, the Monster cable did change the sound in terms of bass. Bass is enhanced, i luv it!"
2,Why the huge plugs?,"This one is kind of a no-brainer.It works perfectly well, but for some reason they decided to add huge plugs on the RCA end, and it has to squeeze in there to fit most jacks. The Left & Right plugs are usually just a little closer together on stereo systems, etc, than these Left & Right cables really want to be.Who tests these things?"
4,It's lead,"It's lead. I use it in my Pentel Graph Gear 1000 and it works fine. Even though it's so thin, it doesn't easily break. It's actually easier to break my .5mm lead."
3,"it's good, but complicated for many users","I bought this program and does what it says, but frankly the average computer users will be bewildered by many of the options. It does a good job of cleaning the computer, but maybe too good of a job. Many users will not know which choices to make and could end up deleting something they don't want deleted.WIN Ultra Clean is a better choice. I have used this program and recommend it for many users and they have less trouble and get more benefit from it."
3,Get off the ground first,"This book is of great help to the potential airline pilot as well as the private pilot with an interest further than his/hers present licenses. However, be warned, this is aimed at the american market in terms of job oppurtunities as well as training shools and technics. As concerns the eluding of pitfalls along the way to a flying career in general, the book is of great help and also lists an extensive number of web sites for one to do further and more precise research as to the potential of the market for a flying career. There is also an insight into the real world of pic's, through interviews and examples of careers."
4,Ok....for the price,"Not the ""holy grail"" of career change/job search piloting books, but not a bad reference for the price. Some good resume ideas.I would for sure recommend it for someone just starting on their research for a new career/career change."
4,Introduces some basics in a fun way.,"While the nursery rhymes ""signed"" here may not be your most favorite from childhood, they work well for teaching a ""hearing"" child some basic signs in a fun way. Solomon Grundy gives the days of the week, 30 Days Has September gives the names of the months, Buckle My Shoe gives numbers up to twenty, Crooked Sixpence is fun with lots of repetition to give confidence, and Mother Goose is just for fun (and to tie in with the theme). Most hearing children learning sign language for fun would be insulted to learn the ""baby"" nursery rhymes, anyway, wouldn't they?"
4,realistic!,"This game is great. The multiplayer is one of the best i've seen. Most games I rate based on the multiplayer. Unlike Halo 2, this game does not have X-Box live which is kind of a let down. But the guns in this game are way more realistic. On Halo 2, a rocket laucher can shoot about 5 to 10 shots where in European assault, only one shot can be made with the bazooka (basically equivalent to rocket launcher). I also like how you can get the upgraded version of your class in this game. The only bad thing in this game is that on CTF, you cant pick the levels you are playing. That is the only flaw in this game IMO."
2,Alright,I mean the soundtrack doesn't reall flow. Its a lot of random music that is in the movie but isn't what you expect.Plus I really wanted that song from the playoff game against texas where Cap Rooney engineers his final scoring drive. I don't know what it is.
4,what is that song???,"DMX & LL CoolJ really made this soundtrack a 4star-album. But still there's a missing one not on th soundtrack. Does anyone remember the song when they're playin the crusaders. When Willy throws the last touchdown pass on the game, there comes out a song going ""Do you wanna revolution, Whooah Whooah Do you wanna revolution, Whooah Whooah"" That song's also cool, but no way to find out the musician nor the title. Can anybody tell me what it is."
3,"Great movie, mediocre soundtrack","After seeing perhaps the best film of the year,I immediately went out and bought the soundtrack and I have to admit, I was a little dissapointed. The cuts by hole, kid rock, jamie foxx, and dmx are decent, however the soundtrack would've been so much better if it had included the adrenaline pumping sports anthems ACTUALLY included in the movie such as Kid Rock's ""Bawitdaba"" and black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"". Another low point is that when I looked in the credits of the cd and saw that additional diolague was included, I thought Pacino's gut wrenching, inspiring pre-game talks would be sandwiched between tracks along with the memorable ""Willie Beaman"" jingle. Instead, I found some meaningless quotes sampled over looped drum beats. Overall, a poor showing for a great movie."
5,Simply Amazing,"While taking my AP Physics course, I realized that I needed help...fast. I knew that there were suppliment books available, but none like this book. Everything that you could need - and nothing more - is contained in this book. The examples given are similar to what I've experienced in class, but given with much more detail and explanation. This book has been an invaluable tool."
5,Exactly as advertised,"Door arrived on time. It was easy to install and serves the perpose just fine, it's a very good product for the money. Pretty good deal."
1,A Feel Good Movie For White Masculinity,"The plot for the story is decent. However, you can't overlook the racial politics in the film. Early on the white protaganist fights a huge black man. This black man is torn from the images of Jim Crow literature. The character is huge, animal-like, non-human and very slow. However, don't worry the white man will prevail and outsmart the beast. That is the slant that is given early on in the movie, which continues throughout the film. Every black character in the movie either gets killed or humuliated."
2,Buyer Beware,"Product requires sustained vigorous shaking (to move the magnet past the coil)that makes it unsuitable for elderly or children. Without sufficient shaking, light is too dim to be useful."
3,WEST BEND,MY CARROTS WERE STILL HARD AFTER COOKING ALL DAY. ITS NOT LIKE THE CERAMIC CROCK POT I USE TO OWN.
3,Okay........,"Group of foreign exchange students who were supposed to have died team up with a medical student who sees death everywhere she goes........Similar plotline as before but somehow diff......2nd best in the series, the deaths are a little far fetched, but kind of believeble,more gruesome than the last, much more chain reacions though, the spider crawls on the guy, he flicks it off, a woman at the restruant pours grease on it, it catches fire, the firemen come, the guy gets out, is hit by hose's water pressure ..........anyways, again you can't get to attached to the characters....has a very surprising twist at the end, it completely changes the story, overall an ok book........."
4,Psychology: An Introduction,I thought this was a great book...Also because I aced the course. This book is clear and is worded so you can remember things easily. Gives great examples!
1,RCBS disapoints,"I bought this scale because RCBS has a good name in the handloading business. I own an RCBS press and dies among other items. The scale is a disapointment. It will not hold zero between throws, and will wander from .1 to .3 of a grain and will need to be re-zeroed constantly while in use. I left it on throughout the night thinking that the circuit need to stabilize and that didnt help. I took in inside where the temperature was warmer and that worked for a while. The scale will hunt for the wieght of the charge. Am going to find a scientific scale that will cost less and be more accurate."
5,ONE OF THE BOOKS I READ IN MY YOUTH THAT I OFTEN THINK OF.,"I order this book through the weekly reader when I was in grade school.I can remember yellow eyes first experince with the dogs and hunter, and seeing his family scampering up a tree to what they thought would be safety,and his harsh lesson in survival. I have often wished that my sons could have read this book, I am sure that like me it would have lived in there memory's a life time . I agree with the readed from Florida if you ever see a copy of this book in a yard sale gobble it up,I know I surely will."
4,Great childrens book told from the pov of a cougar,"I read this book in the 5th grade, and it has stayed in my mind for over 15 years! The story follows the life of an orphaned Puma cub. He battles bears, rivals, and man to eek out a small territory where he can raise his cubs with his mate."
4,That Goldsmith shouldn't have cheated the king!,"This is an excellent book one can use to explain the theories and inventions of Archimedes. I use this book and a presentation on Archimedes to celebrate National Pi Day. My middle school students find it extremely funny when we discuss the theory of water displacement (of the ""gold"" crown) and then speculate on what happened to the goldsmith. They take great delight in learning about the war machines Archimedes invented. (Kids are always interested in the darker side of any subject.) They also find it interesting to discover that Archimedes created exponents. The book is a good resource and makes a worthy attempt at a child friendly explanation of a sometimes complicated body of work."
4,Great product,"I really like bacon but I've always had a hard time with getting it to cook evenly, that's why I purchased this pan. It really does a good job with heating evenly and the press keeps the bacon flat on the pan so the ends don't curl up and then not cook. I've also discovered that because of it's shape and non stick properties, it does a great job on french toast because you can put 4 slices in the pan at once and just like the bacon, it cooks evenly. My only complaint is that the handle on the press should have been made so that it doesn't conduct heat. After a while you have to use an oven mit to pick up the press. If the handle could be made to stay cool, I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Surf Booties,"Great booties... Amazon saves me the legwork of shopping for the items I need. There are only a few places to find surf booties where I live, and I didn't want to have to search all over town. I researched the product, found it at a great price, and had it within the week. I highly recommend it!"
2,Look elsewhere,"Honestly, it took about 10 minutes (mostly extracting the unit from the packaging) to determine this was a return item. If you have decent ears, you'll probably be disappointed. Poor bass, mushy sound. Not recommended."
4,JBL-On Stage II - Speaker and docking station for iPod (Black),"The speakers are loud and clear, however it would have been nice to have a little more bass, but it is understandable that there is'nt much bass response given the small dimensions of the station. Overall, it has great styling and it sounds good. Lastly, for its 130 dollar price tag I thought it could have provided more bass."
2,Unclear about iPod Touch charging capabilities...,"I bought this for 2 reasons: to listen to music, and to charge my iPod touch. The description is not clear about this, so I'll be clear:""THIS SPEAKER SYSTEM DOES NOT CHARGE A 2ND GENERATION iPOD TOUCH UNLESS YOU PLUG THE SPEAKER INTO YOUR COMPUTER. THIS IS A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN IT SEEMS BECAUSE NOW ITS NOT PORTABLE. I NEED TO BRING MY COMPUTER ALONG EVERY TIME I WANT TO USE THE SPEAKER FOR AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF TIME.""This would have been a 4-star product if it charged my ipod as advertised. Since it only does half of what I expected, it gets half the stars.Solution: another $30-$40... [...]note: The shipping/transation was smooth. No complaints."
4,Great sound but doesn't charge iPod Touch,"This is a great iPod speaker dock for this price. It's compact and portable and easy to use. But don't let it's small size fool you: the sound is pretty good, better than I was expecting. My one beef with this unit is that it doesn't charge my iPod Touch, which is inconvenient and also contrary to the statement on the packaging that says ""charges all docking iPod models""."
5,Highly Recommended!!!!,I highly recommend these speakers! Great for traveling or poolside. The remote is the best feature! A must have ipod accessory!
5,Home Worker,"I'm a musician, and work at home - the Onstage II fits right on the desktop and provide ample volume and tone quality. I especially like the (volume) control - touch sensitive - when my phone rings I simply touch the volume control and immediately I have a lower volume for phone conversations.Love this -would highly recommend..."
4,Good Enough for most needs,I found this product to be good enough to deliver sound/tunes in any room I use it in. I was looking for something to use in the areas I don't have my home stereo piped to. It was easy to set up and the controls are nice. The remote is a nice touch too.
4,A great little dock!,"I just picked this up at a pawn shop for $15, a fabulous deal!! It belts out the heaviest that I had on my iPod from Metallica to The Casualities. Yet plays Norah Jones with clean crisp sound. My only grips are that #1: It doesn't charge my phone at the same time. #2: Not a lot of bass. But a great dock otherwise."
4,docking station for ipod,This was gift for Christmas for my daughter=in law who received a new nano ipod. She does like it and uses it.
2,good for short term use,"Good sound at first, but after a few months the quality reduced dramatically. Volume changes on its own for one, and there is a crackling sound that comes along with the bass. Would not get this unless you want something that lasts less than a year."
5,Little Did I Realize!,"What a difference a brand new chain would make! WOW! I sharpen my own chains, but having this brand new one on the saw made all the difference in the world. It was like having a brand new chainsaw already broken in like you want it to be. Cuts through solid oak like a hot knife through warm butter! NICE!"
5,One of the best Rollins' recordings,"The tracks with congas (Jungoso and The Night Has a Thousand Eyes) are absolutely astounding. I have been hearing jazz for 37 years and there are very few things comparable. Actually, these two pieces transcend jazz and become abstract art, while remaining viscerally African. Only these two tracks would make it worthwhile buying this CD.The remainder of the CD is also excellent, including Brown Skin Gal, which another reviewer did not like (if you have a good system you will be able to hear each voice in a separate spatial location, and the naivete and enthusiasm are captivating)Easy five stars"
2,Not worh the price,"I was so excited when I received this pendant until I noticed the poor quality and to top it off the stone and the pentacle are very loosely attached, so it rattles."
4,Best investment for those out of the closet,"When I looked at the product online, I was afraid the stone and pentacle would be securely attached. Being attached or melded into a single piece hinders the flow of energies in this piece. Finding it loose and able to move freely, with ease of repair should either portion break is a great plus in my opinion. I never just ""throw out"" broken jewelry, especially not a religious piece such as this. Should the stone break, I can purchase a replacement, fitting it in nice and neat with little bending to the metal portion. Should the sterling silver bend and break off, I can have it repaired by a jeweler/crafter.It gets four stars only because the metal rubbing against the stone scratches the surface and the only drawback to the design.All in all, this one piece of jewelry gets more complements than any other piece in my collection. I don't mind being noticed. Don't search this type of jewelry out if you want to keep to the shadows."
5,Easily worth 10 stars!,"Robin Laing is an excellent classical guitarist and an insightful, witty songwriter. I like nearly all of the songs. His accent makes it all the better! Give it a listen."
2,Cohen has so many questions to answer,"Cohen's book was seriously challenged by the publication of Karoline Leach's 'In the Shadow of the Dreamchild'. We Carrollians have been waiting for five years now for Cohen to update his book in response. He needs to do so.Is he going to rebut Leach's claims that the whole in-love-with-Alice-story is a myth? What is his response to the amazing discovery of the 'cut pages in diary' document? What does he say to Leach's claims that Dodgson befriended numerous adult women and was probably sexually normal?I for one and many like me are very keen to know where this debate is going. Mr Cohen has promised a reply 'soon'. But when is 'soon?'We need an updated version of this book. Until then I have to give the book just two stars, though I'd like to give more."
2,I was disappointed!,I had to cut the to of every other page to view each page because the book missed that cut.
2,Enjoyable reading about a controversial subject,"1 - Writing and Style:I liked the way Salibi writes. It's fascinating and it keeps you attracted to the story. Above all, the chapters and paragraphs are well threaded. You have a series of questions at the end of every chapter that keep you focused.2 - Content:He tries to smartly undermine the fundamentals of history and philosophy on which the modern Lebanon was built. It's the famous synergy of its communities, mainly middle eastern minorities, fleeing pressure and persecution that bothers Salibi.3 - Conclusion:Salibi is absolutely not a ""Lebanist"" and I am not saying it in a pejorative way! When reading his book, he manages to take you around the confusing and complicated history of Lebanon expressing his views with arguments that are not better than those of his opponents, however you won't stop reading.I recommend this book to the ""History Analysis lovers"". It shows a different face of things specially during the Maan and Shihab eras."
1,proved incorrect facts,Mr. Salibi:The emphasize in the book that the Lebanese Maronite(or Lebanese Christians in general) are Arab descendant raise a red flag about your knowledge. [...]The URL above is 1 out of thousand ... . ..You are more a joke than a respected historian
3,A great Introduction,"The eradication of the 1860 detailed maassacres from the book is a bit dissapointing as it offers a lot of light about the future shape and the emergence of the state of greater lebanon, by France under pressure from an organized social energy ""The Maronites"". On a larger picture the author uses very good and easy commentary about the modern history of Lebanon that helps you easily read through the book without getting bored. The introduction is very beautifully written and is so easily read that you immediatelly can strike up a conversation with any historian and know what the heck he is talking about..remember that you should read nor to contradict nor to believe in, but to weigh and to consider.Pascal Hagge"
2,Early album with dated arrangements,"I cringed when I first heard 'Je, tu, ils', and despite my fondness for Zazie's following albums, rarely re-visit it to try and like it. Three years later (1995) Zazie released Zen, which is superb melodic rock with catchy and imaginative songwriting and musical arrangements, but this .... Dated backing synths and attempts at 'funky' guitars, and limp songs.Good things: the great 'Sucre, sale'; 'Snowball', interesting for us English language speakers, a little kid's dark tale, but Zazie in English loses the magic for me.If you aren't annoyed by the dated sounds, maybe you'll be less blind to the charms of the songs than I am. Mylene Farmer's first two albums are older, yet the unique songs shine through to my ears, and hopefully some people will feel the same with this. One for completists, if you can pick it up mid-price in France."
4,veeeeeeeeeeeeery gooooooooood^^*,It's very exciting and pleasant for reading this book!!Thank you Peter~
4,A good cat story,"This is a story about a self proclaimed 'cat hater' who is given a cat as a present. Peter 'the cat hater' melts when Norton the cat begins to purr. As the story unfold you find out that Norton is one cool cat - he travels, he seems to understand how Peter is feeling, he waits for Peter, he comes when his name is called. I enjoyed reading about how Peter's dad (also a cat hater) could not resist the charms of Norton. It was a funny and touching book about how Norton effects various people's lives."
5,"A True Delight, Even For A Non Cat Lover","I have always liked cats fine but this book really got to me. I could not put it down and there were times I laughed out loud and tears came as well. I did not expect to find Mr. Gethers' work so honest, so warm and engaging but I look forward to reading all of his books! And I may just get a cat. If Peter Gethers can be less of a curmudgeon because of one special cat, maybe I can too."
5,Stars for Norton,"I am an avowed Norton fan. Love the travels, the meals, the fun, and the quiet times. Norton is a great example of his breed and we who own them are blessed."
3,No Headphone Jack!!!!,The sound is very good for speakers at this price range..but no headphone jacks...pretty pointless sinceI bought the speakers so the whole family wouldn't have to listen to hip hop!
1,No way!,"I bought these speakers and attached them to a docking station that apple makes for the ipod. I found the speakers HORRIBLE...when I turned up the music anything more than 1/3 of the way, there was a tinny, crackling noise in the music. I don't know what all these positive reviews for this product are...I read them before I bought, and REGRETTED IT! Best of luck if you buy this product."
2,"Where's the headphone jack, Jack?","These speakers sound great - but sometimes you want to crank it up and in the office that's a no-no. So you reach for your phones and... no place to plug them in! How lame is that? Also whoever designed the Volume/On/Off knob is an idiot. The thing is so streamlined and slippery that when you try to turn it, the whole speaker just slips away from you. They're so light that they don't have enough resistance to stay put. So you have to hold it in place with one hand while you turn the knob with the other (unless you velcro them to your desk or something). Too bad because - like I said - they sound great."
2,Huge disappointments,"Terrific example of style over substance. Waited for weeks for a version to match the rest of the system's color & got a pair when they were issued. Read reviews about ""technology overcoming small size"" -- baloney. No bass response to speak of; Duets perform far less well than my 5-year-old beige (SO 20th-Century!) Altec-Lansings for the same purchase price.Bottom line: Speakers look great, sound cheesy."
1,Staggering through life more like!,After reading this you'll want to nail somebody to something to. What type of spirit in the word spiritual did the writer of these musings mean. After this man is departed they will have to add another circle to hell. This is just sacarine coated nausious rubbish. I despair at some publishers sometimes.
3,Other Koh-I-Noor,"For those who were fascinated by Rushby's very ggod book, you might want to learn a bit more about how it passed from the Sikhs to the Brits in ""Flashman and the Mountain of Light"", a relatively recent installment in George MacDonald Fraser's memoirs of the completely (? ) fictional Sir Harry Flashman. While working in fiction, Fraser as always weaves his bounder of a hero into a very accurate description of the historical facts"
3,"Good Movie, Poor Quality","Considering the age of this movie, I would guess it was hard to get the sound any better. No matter what I tried to do, it was edgy, and muffled. The movie itself is really funny though."
4,Father Knows Best,Set in New York City during the end of the 19th Century: a loving father and a 'ditsy' mother show who is really in charge of the family. The geniusness of the ditsy mother is allowing the father to believe that he is running the family. The overall feeling of this film is one of warmth and humor as we follow the intimate details of this family as they go about thier daily routine. William Powell and Irene Dunne lead the cast in their antics. A real family treat.
1,Wonderful Movie BUT.....,"If you really LOVE this movie, than do not buy this version....it is truly awful. The sound is horrible! and I will put up with almost any lousy DVD....There is a section where the sound just completely stops and then starts up again and you miss the conversation! This version is by COLLECTABLES RECORDS CORP. ALPHA HOME ENTERTAINMENT.They should be ashamed!"
1,A Film worth restoring! Terrible sound makes it unwatchable!,"I watched this movie many years ago on AMC. It made me laugh outloud! I cannot understand why the DVD transfer is so poor.The colors are faded and the sound is so garbled that you can't understand what they are saying. This is the kind of film that deserves to be transferred by real professionals. If that ever happens I will buy a new copy. The one I own, I will keep as a reminder that Madacy entertainment=poor quality."
3,Young Elizabeth Taylor,I keep remembering the movie better than it isI watch it again because I can't help myselfYou try
1,Unfortunate Disappointment,I love Irene Dunne and looked forward to watching this film. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! The quality is most disappointing.
2,Try again?,"The first DVD I purchased of this movie had distorted pixels, so I returned it. I asked for a second DVD and it, too, has distortion with the video and no audio. Should I try again?"
3,Let's not get carried away...,"I bought the Digicom DVD-R edition based on the rave reviews on Amazon. True, the transfer is a distinct improvement over every other public domain edition of this film, but it is not 'digitally remastered.' It's a decent print in that there is no splicing and the film is presented in its 118-minute entirety (unlike most of the public domain releases, which are travesties). That said, the sound is flat and the color is somewhat washed out. In short, I still have an SP videocassette of LIFE WITH FATHER captured from an airing 20 years ago on American Movie Classics, and it's better than the Digicom mastering. But yes, this edition is definitely an improvement, and would be worth the cost if you've only seen the film in bottom-of-the-well public domain video releases."
1,Great movie-poor product,My husband and I love this movie. We have watched it at my parents house and on netflix. Unfortunately this copy is of extremely poor quality. The sound is terrible. After watching for about 40 seconds we turned it off and will never watch this copy again. You can't understand a single thing being said as it is all garbled. After inspecting the dvd it became obvious that it was a burnt copy and the label looks like it was printed on a home printer.
2,Buy the remastered version,"The sound on this video is muddled and difficult to understand--it sounded better in the 50's on my parents' black and white TV. The coloring is less than realistic and the action-to-sound sync just the tiniest bit off. All in all, it makes the film not worth watching"
1,LIFE WITH FATHER,"This DVD has terrible sound and video, my old VHS sounds better than this. I cant understand why this wonderful movie isnt being remastered in HD quality by its own Hollywood Studio...the versions that are coming out are from foreign companies...come on ""HOLLYWOOD"" wake up and put this wonderful movie on DVD so we can enjoy a great movie...why are you overlooking this!!"
1,Extremely poor quality,My wife has this on VHS and the picture and audio are much better. The video is grainy and the audio scratchy.
2,Madacy DVD quality is poor but watchable,"I agree that the picture and sound quality of the Madacy DVD is poor, but I do find it watchable by turning up the contract and color on my TV. This film is in the public domain (copyright protection was lost) so Warner Brothers (Turner) will probably never spend the money to restore and release the film in a quality product. Where there is no copyright protection anyone can copy and sell the product. The print used to master the Madacy DVD was probably a 16mm dupe, the negative being made from another print causing the fuzzy generation loss. Finding a good original 16mm or 35mm Technicolor print to use for a master is next to impossible. Unless Turner feels it has enough of a market to warrant the expense of restoring and releasing an unprotected picture, we are stuck with what we get from public domain distributors. Maybe Criterion will come through once again."
1,The worst transfer to DVD around!,"They have literally destroyed one of my all time favorite movies. DO NOT BUY, RENT , or even STEAL this DVD. Stay with the VHS copy. Don't be fooled by the low price. It is atrocious. Terrible sound and picture, makes it totally unwatchable! I love the movie, I just can't believe they thought they could pull this one off."
3,My cat's breath smells like cat food,"I was drawn to this product because it's called a ""feast"", but I was somewhat put off by it being a ""Fancy Feast"". My cat certainly deserves a feast! I mean, he runs himself ragged from morning till night going after mice and by the end of the day he's bushed. And frustrated too, since I had him declawed and all. But he don't need anything fancy, that's for sure. I just want him to enjoy a cat feast and leave it at that. He's not one of them cat's that prances around with his bushy tail waving around like some lady feline. I know my Tubby Toughie would be in cat heaven if they changed the name to ""Fighter Feast"" or ""Beastly Feast"". So, I'm giving this product 3 stars: five stars because it's a pretty great feast, minus three stars because the name offends Tubby Toughie, and plus one star because I like to lick the can."
5,A reminder of days gone by,The CD came quicly and in great shape. I sent it to an old friend who lives far away...as a reminder of great days gone by. I has warmed her just like the title...SAX BY THE FIRE...suggests! Thanks Amazon
5,Froth 'n Sauce,"This is by far the best frother I have seen. I would NOT, howver, recommend the one that froths only. I like the ""froth 'n sauce"" version because the paddles are interchangeable allowing you to make froth that is lightly frothed (oopen-hole paddles) or extremely frothed (small-holed paddles).If I had been the manufacturer I would have added a time for a few dollars more since the unit makes froth too thich for me it I leave it on until it goes off automatically. You can, howver, lift the unit off the base at any time in the cycle. I would have also made the froth container clear instead of opaque and put 1 cup and 2 cup fill markings on it.These 2 criticisms are minor in my opinion, as I think is it by far the best frother on the market today and is considerably less that competitive models that are not nearly as good."
1,Defective unit,"I was very excited to try this after reading the reviews. However, the first time I tried to use it I discovered that I had been sent a defective unit which didn't work at all-it does not even turn on. I wish the seller had checked it out to be sure it worked before shipping it to me. What a disappointment! Am returning it to Amazon for a refund."
3,Great beef look,"This food variety is ground, thus my cat doesn't care that much for this variety. But, he liked the taste of it a lot so I have been buying it off and on throughout the years. My previous cat really liked it so I've purchased quite a few of these. It's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares? If your cat likes ground, give this one a try for sure."
1,Absolute waste of time,"I rarely quit books especially if I have invested 400 pages into them, but I quit this one. I know Oprah likes Wally Lamb and I have enjoyed some Oprah books in the past but this was a huge disappointment. The main character is a bitter guy. Lamb does a poor job in character development. Would make a good Lifetime Channel movie.If you read an 800 page book, you should at least learn something if the writing is not so special, but there is no educational value either. There is a mentally ill chracter in the book so Lamb could have used this opportunity to educate the reader on some of those issues but I felt that it was minimally researched. Skip this one. If you want to read other Oprah books try:A Fine Balance (I think this Oprah's best selection so far)House of Sand and Fog"
5,Very memorable story,"I love this book. The characters are so real. Some parts will be heart-wrenching, other parts will make you laugh. I finished this book a couple of weeks ago and it still comes into my mind. This book is almost 900 pgs and I read it in 3 weeks. Don't let the size scare you, it is worth all the other summer reading you may give up for it."
4,"It took awhile, but I grew to love this book","I am very much a fan of Mr. Lamb's first novel, ""She's Come Undone"", so when I heard about this, I ran to the bookstore.It did take me some time to warm up to this, and there were parts where I thought I couldn't take it any longer, where I felt, that if I could only put it down I would be out of my misery...but the problem was, that I couldn't put it down...I wanted to find out how this horrifying and tiring ordeal that Dominick--the main character and the twin who is sane--has to go through ends.When I finally did get to the ending, I was overjoyed, satisfied and even a little sad to see it end.I believe Wally Lamb is a gifted writer, with a lot to say. I can't wait for the next one!"
5,Enjoy the journey,"This book is truly incredible and keeps you interested despite its size. I found myself enjoying the story as it unfolded instead of wanting to know what happened at the end. You feel like you get a glimpse into someone's thoughts and struggles - which will be ongoing even after the last page. I also found that there is so much in this book that I would probably make more of the connections of how events interrelated if I read it again. All I can say is enjoy the journey, you will not regret picking up this remarkable book."
5,"A compelling, interesting, and realistic literary journey.","I work in the field of mental health and can't say enough good stuff about this book. It is so realistic that I kept thinking I was reading non-fiction. I intend to recommend it to all family members of schizophrenics, all staff (even our psychiatrists), and all of my colleagues in the field. I laughed out loud, cried, and was most of all entertained. I read (devoured) this book in one weekend. What a fantastic novel!"
3,This time I'VE come undone!,"This book is not nearly as compelling as his first book, and I'm sorry I read it. It seems Wally Lamb wrote ""She's Come Undone"" because he had a story to TELL;he wrote his second book because he had a story to SELL. I was disappointed."
4,I Know This Much Is True,"This book,though long, waists no time in grabbing your attention and keeping it. There are probably hatefull people in everyones life. This books takes a long look at the evolution of becoming a hatefull individual and disects it until not only is the character in the book cured but you may find forgiveness in your heart for anyone in your life that is unlikable. During most of the novel there is not a likable person to relate to. Yet as you begin to know and understand the characters, one feels drawn into their lives. Be ready to let your work go for a while. You won't want to put this down."
5,As an avid reader and writer....,"I find it utterly refreshing that Wally Lamb had the vision and determination, not to mention the talent, to create such a complex and epically proportioned novel. The naysayers will whine that the book's ending is too pat and that the ""history lesson"" is gratuitious, but any author that can inspire hundreds of thousands of people to read a novel of such depth and sheer scope deserves positive recognition.I found the novel to be every bit as riveting and character-driven as ""She's Come Undone"" and I have recommended both novels to many friends and colleagues, with generally glowing response. Thank you, Mr. Lamb. In an age ruled by the 90-minute entertainment package you've given us something in which to sink our teeth and minds."
2,You call this good?????,"This book was very long, and very slow. I am not one to abandon a book, but doing so to this one was very tempting. So much garbage about nothing. I agree with the reader who said BLAH BLAH BLAH. Maybe if it was shorter it may have been a little easier to swallow. The part about Domenico's book I had to skip altogether because it was bogus. I have read many books in my life and this one does not get a rave review from me. Wally Lamb should have stuck to the likes of ""She's Come Undone."" That was a great book, so good, it took less than 2 days to read. Take my advice, skip this book unless an ""Oprah"" atmosphere fascinates you."
2,unenjoyable,"I found reading this book a chore - the characters were unlikeable , the story was depressing and i thought i would never finish it !"
5,I know this much is true,I enjoy reading the books by Wally Lamb. They would be better if they didn't have so much cussing in them. He definitely has a creative mind.
1,#1 New York Times?,"I cannot believe this book made the NYT's Best Seller List. Furthermore, I cannot believe it has a rating of 4 1/2 stars. This is one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. It has everything from psychosis, child abuse, murder, and vulgarity."
4,keeps you going,Very moving. I didn't want the story to end. Reader was excellant. I could close my eyes and it was as if I was watching a movie.
4,I Know this Much is True,"Wally Lamb creates very complex and believale characters in this story of a man with a twin brother, dead mother, ex-wife, sleaze-ball best friend, abusive step-father and a hysterical sense of humor. The characters have different sides to them, like real people. They don't have only one defining characteristic. Instead, the characters are diverse and Lamb allows the reader a chance to realy understand each person."
2,Reads like a Mini-Series,I was dissappointed in this book; not only because it was predictable but because it focused on the lowest common denominator of human nature. It lacked any positive message and was told like a tired soap opera...900 pages of trash...I hoped for better....
2,Chock-full of nuisance,"Though well-written, I found none of the characters in this novel to be particularly likeable. The narrator, Dominick, was irritating, insensitive, and selfish, which made it hard for me to sympathize with his plight, especially his love problems. Nothing that happened (with exception to the first mutilation scene) elicited little more than a ""ho-hum"" from me. With an opening like that, it outweighed any climax this novel could have had. Where was the climax anyway? I expected the ending to be better, but it was highly unrealistic and (dare I say it) cheezy. I don't recommend this book, but I know that I'm in the minority."
3,Good Book,"This is a good book, definitely worth the read. But, it's too long. The story could have been just as good with several less chapters."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"Like others, I was attracted to this book primarily because of the author's name. And after reading it, I've come to the conclusion that it's really two books: ""I Know This Much Is True"", an entirely forgettable and derivative novel, and the more provocative manifesto that lies between the lines, which I call ""True Is Much This Know I"". True Is Much This Know I takes a harsh stance, and almost mocking tone of African-Americans, the mentally challenged and Jews. And while I take issue with Mr. Lamb's hostile stance on these groups, I admire his courage to candidly speak his views on these ""difficult and irritating"" groups, even though all Wally Lamb's speaking is done strictly between the lines. Perhaps the most surprising - and disappointing - aspect of True Is Much This Know I is Wally Lamb's uncompromising and ""factually based"" Holocaust denial. Anti-Semitism, bigotry and racism are not my cup of tea. So I guess I'm just not cut out to be a Wally Lamb fan."
1,Forrest Gump meets Prince of Tides,"I could only get through the first 300 pages or so. Too many shrinks/MSW's eerily reminiscent of Lowenstein in Conroy's Prince of Tides. Like Forrest Gump, Lamb's narrator Dominick trots between present and past and embraces politically-correct-pop-culture nonsense (Native Americans good, white male fathers bad). The basic plot was less believable than that of Forrest Gump, more believable than that of Prince of Tides. Was Lamb writing for Hollywood? Say it ain't so...I did find Dominick's voice persuasive, perhaps because he was so foul-mouthed. Lamb did a pretty good job developing a basically unlikeable character who held my interest for the first 300 pages. (for a much better job at this - in a much shorter book, not coincidentally - see Ha Jin's Waiting.)"
2,At first I was anticipating good stuff; I ended hating the book.,"This book is over nine hundred pages long. I resent the author taking up my time and money for this BS. Why? His novel, ""She's Come Undone"" was so fine and compasionate in the area of mental weirdness. Here in this book he writes about the same thing, it's much longer, and he ""makes fun"" of mental illness issues. He obvious had a bad psychiatrist/therapist."
3,Not Bad But Not Great,I almost stopped reading this book several times. It has a good story line but it wears you down with his self-destructive nature. I found myself skipping pages to get back to the dialog...not a good sign.
4,Enthralling 900 page novel except for the last 13 pages,"I found ""I know this much is true"" to be impossible to put down. Being a student, I didnt think I wanted to tackle a 900 pager over the holidays (I received the book as a gift) but I soon found myself devouring the book in just over a week. Lamb is a great storyteller, and his character development is wonderful. Just one gripe: the book comes to such a natural close at the penultimate chapter. For some reason he throws in one last chapter that ties up all possible loose ends in a happy ending. The whole book deals with a man's struggle for purpose, happiness, identity, etc, and then we are to believe everything is just rosy? Oh well, I'll dock him one star and forgive him."
4,"This work is a well-written, well-researched novel.",Wally Lamb is truly a gifted writer. It is obvious that Mr. Lamb did a great deal of research in putting this work together. And his hard work certainly paid off in a piece that is not only intriguing and entertaining but challenging in it's ability to address forgiveness and renovation. He went far beyond the typical beachside entertainment. He gave his readers something to think about and grow from.
5,This is the best book I've ever read.,This is truly the best book I've ever read. The characters are so realistic and well-developed. Wally Lamb is one of the finest contemporary authors. I couldn't put down this novel until I finished it--so I just stopped reading for my classes for a few days!
1,900 pages was unnecessary,"I read this book per a recommendation from a friend and I just don't get the hype. The first 450 pages were drawn out story of twin boys that took me 2 months to get thru because I was so uninspired by the story and wanted it to get to the point. At pages 450 on the book gains momentum with the story of the grandfathers life, death of Thomas and everything that follows. But even after reading all 900 pages, the book is about angry men that can't get past all the unfairness in life. It was full of physical and emotional abuse. The last 30 pages finally create resolution for the main character that he can move on with his life - too much turmoil and unnecessary long story to get to the final outcome. If this book was 400 pages, my review may be different."
3,"It's long, a bit disappointing: SOMEWHAT RECOMMENDED","It's long. I would recommend quite a few books before I would recommend this one, but despite all that I DID enjoy it.Despite its length, it reads smoothly, and it IS engrossing most of the way. The relationship between the two brothers is complex and tangible.I suppose the reason I give it three stars is because when compared to SHE's COME UNDONE, this title just doesn't measure up. I was much more emotionally involved in that story.One of Oprah's better recommendations...and I AM eagerly awaiting lamb's next book..."
2,I found the book to be far too lengthy for its content.,"I really was excited to read this book as I had enjoyed so many of Oprah's selections over the years. With this book, the slow start disturbed me right away. It took me until page 232 to decide maybe it was worth reading. Those first pages could have been condensed into 5-10 pages. Then, the major events in the book were in no way subtle. Every big point had to hit the characters with a ton of bricks (each individual brick weighing two hundred pounds) so ten totally devastating occurences came into play with each event. Please!! It seems as though the author wrote the first draft and didn't bother to go back and edit for content. I loved his other books, but found this work to have potential with proper revisions, but it missed the mark and was not worthy of the time required to read it."
5,One of the all time best!,"Yes, it was long and yes it was arduous. But it was worth the long read! So many books just gloss over subjects that are seriuosly dealt with by Wally Lamb. These are real topics that in one way or another will affect each of us at some time or another in some way. Lamb's rhetoric and use of dialogue are unmatched by most authors. Flowery prose and description is easy to compose compared to the painful process of describing one man's journey down a painful and tortuous path to healing."
4,A MOUTH DROPPING UNBELIAVABLE READ,"I thought this book as a book of such emotions from tears to laughs, I've never read a book with so much twists of emotions. I would not only recommend this book but, definatly read it again!!"
1,From the ridiculous to the . . .,"Well, to the more ridiculous, actually. I felt my first attack of bulemia coming on during the reading of this cesspool of psychodrivel. It's success proves that the the ore of human gullibility is inexhaustible and that Oprah and her readers are its dependable miners. This baby is the mother lode!"
5,a new favorite,"This book does not need another review but it deserves one. Simply put, this is a rare and special and magically transformative book. I can only hope that the lessons it shares are not fleeting because they should become imprints on ones soul. I hope I never forget them. Thank you Wally Lamb!"
5,The book that sparked my joy for reading,"This is my absolute favorite book. The story is beautiful, touching, suspensful, everything a reader wants. Ever since I read this book I have really enjoyed reading for pleasure. The plot contains enough characters to keep you on your toes but not too much that an over abundance of characters flood your memory. I couldn't put this book down. I would say it's more of a chick book, but I hope guy's would enjoy it as well.Just as a side note, I always thought guys were over exagerating the pain of getting kicked in the crotch, but after reading the description and anguish main character, Dominick, encounters, I will never second guess that pain again.I was completely captivated by this novel. Highly, HIGHLY recommend."
2,The Charybdis of current fiction,"Reading this interminable tome is akin to being sucked inexorably into a swirling eddy that repeats itself until drowning would be considered a blessed relief. If Mr. Lamb is the master of anything, it is of repetition, and I was rather hoping about mid way through that he would make good use of combination of booze and Percodan to end the horror. The endless monologue between old man Domenico and ""The Monkey"" was the embodiment of my whole reaction to the book - for God's sake, get on with it. In all, it was the most repetivive, tedious book I have plowed through in many a moon. A friend of mine loaned me the book and I read it from cover to cover. What I should have done was skip all the drivel in between."
4,Engaging and Moving,"This is a very good novel that kept my interest and personal involvement as it wove through a story of brotherly love and conflict, a dysfunctional family and its mysteries, searches for one's identity, life's joys and crushing dissappointments, mental illness, cruelty mirrored by kindness, self-discovery and the acceptance of responsibility, and redemption on many levels for many people. This is very ambitious undertaking and could have been a syrupy melodrama, but Lamb effectivly connects all these factors into a very effective and moving story."
2,Disappointing,"If Wally Lamb had stuck to telling the story of the sibling relationship between Dominick and Thomas, I'm certain the novel would have been much better and a lot shorter. There are entirely too many plot lines within this novel (i.e. Dom's relationship with Dressa, Joy's AIDS dilemma, the crazy Italian grandfather, etc.). Much of the novel could have been condensed with the help of a good editor. The ending was also out of left field. I didn't believe for one minute that Dominick and Thomas were part black, Indian, or whatever. Wally Lamb has about three or four novels going on within ""I Know This Much is True."" My suggestion is that he tell the Ralph Drinkwater story. This character seemed much more interesting that the Dominick Birdsey's throughout most of the novel."
1,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!","I wont need 1,000 words to review this loooooong book. It was time consuming, to say the least and to think that Wally Lamb asks us to give him so much attention for such dribble makes me wonder about reading any more of his novels."
2,I Know This Much Is False. . .,"I was hoping to read something as stellar as ""She's Come Undone,"" but was disappointed. I'm still not sure what the whole point of this novel was. At first, it seemed to be a statement about the effects of mental illness on the patient and his family. Then, the author swerved into the grandfather's autobiography, which included some tasty parts about his mother-in-law's Italian experiences (ie. killing a man by adding crushed glass to his food). There were many times when, while reading the book, I felt exasperated and misled. And it was far too long! Why so many pages?"
3,A bit of a let-down!,"First of all, I read his first novel ""She's Come Undone"" in about one night because it was so wonderfull. I really thought that this book would have been the same way, but I can't even get past the first hundered or so pages! The book is nowhere as gripping as his first....I do feel though that you can enjoy this book, but if you are getting it thinking that it will compare to his first, you will be let down!"
2,Lamb Misses the Mark,"I was touched by Lamb's work ""She's Come Undone."" I was incredibly moved by it. That was not the case with this novel. I had an awful time trying to read it. The plot was dull, I did not like the characters, and I was simply disappointed. This novel was also about 300 pages too long. I was beginning to think Lamb just wanted to write for writing's sake. I am aware that many people adored this novel, but I am not one of them."
3,Get a Prozac prescription before reading,"Although providing readers with a vivid, imaginative and poignant narrative - a more depressing story could not have been written in recent times..Lamb's story introduces us to characters who suffer abuse, personal failure, rape, self mutilation, violence, loss of family, death of a child, paranoia, child abuse, molestation, divorce, loss of parents, murder, racism, discrimination and adultery.A gripping story that I couldn't put down from beginning to end, but I then had to watch back to back episodes of I LOve Lucy to recover."
5,"I Know This Much Is True, a truly moving novel","I Know This Much I Know is True is a deep and powerful story of the love and life of two identical twin brothers. The first 200 pages were tough to get through and times shockingly graphic. Yet the 700 pages following captures the attention and hearts of Lamb's readers, pulling them fully in to a story that is nearly impossible to put down. The the transparency at which Lamb allows his readers to see into the hearts of each of his character's transforms them into people more than fictional beings. The struggle Lamb portrays through Dominick's eyes is one most captivating aspects of the novel. Dominick's struggles are both common and uncommon and provide room for each reader to individually relate and empathise with. Wally Lamb, in I Know This Much I Know is True created a fictional masterpiece."
2,"Clumsily written, but an excellent paperweight","I've tackled many 900+ page books before, but none of them felt as much a chore as Wally Lamb's emotionally manipulative and overwrought I Know This Much to Be True. Well I know this much to be true: Lamb's book is good at pushing the buttons of reader sensibilities by pushing all the hot button issues, but it fails to tackle a basic understanding of good, lively writing. This book need not so much an editor as a mop to clean up the emotional molasses."
2,a bitter disappointment,"I was so ready to thoroughly enjoy this book. It starts out with a good idea: identical twins, one schizophrenic, one not,the guilt, the pain, the burden that brings, but never quite follows through. I get the sense that Lamb is trying too hard to write like a man, after he had done so well writing as a woman in She's Come Undone. The text seemed to me too pre-packaged- tough male who needs to get in touch with his feelings, and while I enjoyed this man's search for and through his past (most esp. the memoir of his ego-centric grandfather), the book offers no meaningful end, just a hollow token so we might feel like Dominick has gotten everything he really wants, but then we have the awful realization that it was just another sugar coated, sell-out, ending that left me for one quite unsettled and unsatisfied. 900 pages leads to this? It seems to me that Lamb fell asleep at the typewriter for the ending and let Danielle Steel finish his book for him."
5,Most excellent... compare to Thomas Wolfe,"You fall into the lives of these characters as if you fell into a bucket and became the bucket. I know these two men intimately simply by the tale that dragged me kicking and screaming into their asylums, their internal and external prisons and by their love for each other and for the women in their lives. You'll walk away from this book, but you'll come back to it now and again because it just might change your life."
5,Wally Lamb's 900 pg second work is just as inspiring,"What an inspiring and excellent job by Wally Lamb He has definately proven himself to be an author of phenomenal talent, and heart."
4,"Intellectually Stimulating, yet heartwrenching","I couldn't put this book down! A good friend recommended it to me and then I bought them lunch to thank them. This was one of the most moving books I've ever read, yet the ending was much too abrupt."
2,Too Much Browbeating,"For a 900 page book, this book offers far too much repetition, megatons of male anger & self-flagellation and too little resoultion. (How many times does the reader have to be told that the main character hates his stepfather? I gave up counting at 30.) The author spends over 800 pages telling us over and over again about what a mess the various characters have made of their lives and then gives us a Cliffnotes ending where everyone finds resolution, love and redemption in the last 26 pages. This book was recommended to me by someone with whom I've exchanged dozens of books over the years and, until now, enjoyed each book she's sent my way. If this book had been 200 pages long, I wouldn't have bothered to write this review. But at a voluminous 900 pages, this book offers too little for such a large expenditure of time."
3,Not summer reading,"This was a pretty depressing read. There were a lot of graphic details that I wasn't expecting (spoilers) - someone hacks off his own hand, the same person is a paranoid schizophrenic, abuse (rape, child abuse) - but wait, there's *even* more. You get the idea. This is not an escapist book by any means. Some editing would have made it tighter."
2,"A Dissapointment Next to ""She's Come Undone""","Having fallen in love with Wally Lamb's first book, ""She's Come Undone,"" I assumed I would enjoy ""I Know This Much Is True"" as well. But almost 200 pages into this behemoth of a novel, I was ready to put it back on the bookshelf and move onto something more entertaining, more enlightening, more redeeming. Not only has Lamb failed to make Dominick a character I could in any way relate to, he has failed to make me care about any of his predicaments. Nevertheless, I read the whole thing, hoping that through the ending, at least, I would find something to sink my teeth into, beit language, plot, or humanity. I found none of the above. The summary-like ending was highly anticlimatic - a ""perfect"" fit with the rest of the 896 pages. At the heart of this book is a good story. Perhaps Wally Lamb just needed a little more time, and a better editor, to find it."
2,When will it ever end???,"I loved Lamb's book ""She's Come Undone"" and I suppose that I expected the same here...but I was sadly disappointed. The characters seemed to drone on and become more pitiful by the moment. The interspersed stories of various characters were incredibly lengthy and boring, and didn't add much to the story. Not to mention the fact that suicide seemed the only way out (for me) towards the end! Would only recommend it to someone in need of some serious downers!!"
3,I KNOw THis Much is True,JOB would have empathized with the main character. I just found the constant whining to be a distraction. And then to tie up all the negative loose ends with a short journey into the implausable wasw off putting. Didn't do it for me.
4,Amazing battery life,"I have tried 2 different types of aftermarket batteries and both times they were fails, The Lenmar is amazing, I just shot a wedding and rehearsal dinner over two days and the battery indicator on my 1DS never moved off of full, over 400 shots and it is still going strong. It matched up to my 5d Mk1 and MK II in terms of shots/charge. The only reason I gave it 4 stars vs 5 is due to the quality of the locking switch on the battery, it feels a little flimsy, I am going to take the end cap from my old Canon batteries and just put them on the Lenmark, it is easily done with the removal of two small screws."
2,Third party batteries are a low-stakes gamble,"Having recently received this battery, I cannot attest to it's longevity.However, I can comment on how well the one I received fits a Canon EOS 1d Mark II, and the verdict is poor. I have added a product image to demonstrate the gap between the battery and the camera body. You can decide if it is acceptable.I did swap the end cap from the dead (OEM) Canon battery onto the Lenmar pack and surprisingly the fit was no better, leading me to the conclusion that it is the pack itself which is slightly misshapen.I am going to fall back on the ""you get what you pay for"" cliche and recommend buying the original NP-E3 from Canon. That's what I did, after realizing the cost ""savings"" was more than offset by the stress I would feel using this battery if a rain cloud blew my way.I will keep this in the rotation (on sunny days) in an attempt to preserve life on my new OEM Canon NP-E3."
1,Didn't even work,"Ok, When I saw the packaging I told me Self ""wow, This looks better than I thought"". I charged it and installed it. It looked fine and the seal is better than other brands I have and is kind of comparable to my beaten up original Battery.However, these were the only good things about it. The Battery is dead, I tried to charge it few times but it never charged. the Stage 2 release is stiff. The handle broke when I tried to twist it to open the battery. So I paid a good amount of money for nothing.I should have bought an original. Those may not be the cheapest things in the world, but they work perfectly and you don't have to worry about anything else when you are in the field."
5,Fantastic Battery,Started using this in my used 1D Mkii that came with factory batteries. This is miles better than what I have been using. Lasts over 500 shots easily and holds a charger for weeks without a loss in battery life. MUCH cheaper than the stock Mkii battery to boot!
5,A very nice boom box,I got this boom box for Christmas and it has very good sound. The power drive woofer makes all the difference by providing deep bass. If you don't want deep bass you can turn it off. The high frequencies are clear as well as the vocals. The sound only distorts at top volume which is extremely loud. This is the best sounding boom box I have ever heard. I have no complaints and recommend this boom box. It is a good value for the money.
5,Sony cfdg55,"Hey guys! You would not believe about this Boombox! It is a very nice Sony boombox! What I love about this Boombox is that it is pretty light! It has a power drive woofer, a twin amplifier, and it is a very powerful boombox! Great job, Sony!!"
4,"nice watch, great price!","After seeing this watch here on sale for 109.00, I got one for myself and my coworker bought one for his wife. We both had some trouble when we got the watch because it appeared to be broken. When we tried to set the watch, the minute hand wouldn't work and seemed to be stuck. Luckily, we figured out that the dial just needed to be pulled out another notch. It has worked perfectly once it was set, and I'm glad we didn't send them back!This watch looks nice on the wrist- kind of sporty with a hint of ""glam"" thanks to the small diamonds. The extra black wrist band is a really nice touch, and it's very easy to switch the bands. In the picture they have shown now, the white band looks matte when infact there is a hint of shine in the leather. It isn't overly shiny though.I'm glad I got this watch for the price paid, but would definitely not pay the price shown on the sticker which is 750.00."
1,"Ummm, not very good at all.","This album is a great disappointment. I have seen Henry Butler live on several ocassions and love his acoustic piano work, but this is just annoying. His singing voice is awful and the music wears out very quickly. I don't reccomend this album in any way."
1,Awful!!,"This stand is awful. I have a ""swivel"" tree stand that I love, but it's currently across the country in storage so I bought this for the mean time. It leaks water everywhere- and the bolts are really hard to screw in and hurt your hands. Do not buy!!"
3,good book,I think that this book was very entertaining. It had funny and sad parts. It was sad how in the end Cyd Charisse could not be with shrimp. This was touching but I think that there were some parts of the book that didn't have to be in there. Overall it was a good book.
2,Decent - but....,Decent lighter but I did see anything in the listing that it was not butane. It just says windproof so I Assumed it was butane. Good luch lighting it with even a slight breeze.
1,Disappointed,lighter fluid dries up fast and by no means is it wind proof. With a 4 star rating i was expecting a lot more.
2,What?,"I'm going to review this in comparison to Zippo.Pros: Compared to Zippo it is slimmer, has a pull out reservoir for lighting a pipe, fire or something else you would need that for.Cons: smaller amount of fuel than a zippo. Wick burns out faster, but is longer. Chews through flints faster. Obviously cheaper construction, thinner metal, sharp edges, rattles. My sparker has gotten really crappy after only 4 flint changes.Thoughts: Get a Zippo, they are better built lighters and have a lifetime warranty. If you need to light a pipe you're not going to be using a petrol fluid lighter, if you're lighting a fire, get some swedish fire steel."
5,The best show ever from the UK...,I love Doc Martin.... This ensemble is fantastic ... The story line is great and I really love that Amazon has brought it to Video On Demand.... I can hardly wait until Season 5 is available.... Brilliant
5,drama and comedy by the shore,"I watch this show weekly! Love it! Excellent medical drama,comedy and life by the seashore.The scenery is gorgeous and the poeple of Portwenn are lovely down to earth people.Well written! Excellent quality programming."
3,"Come on, get involved, til the mystery is solved.","This CD features music from variousScooby Dooshows. Of course, the theme songs are all here. There are also some bubblegum songs that played on the original show during the chase scenes. Remember the show where the Scooby Gang teamed with a guest-star every week? Well, the songs sung by guest-stars Jerry Reed and Davy Jones are here. The songs from the later shows are mostly sung by Scooby and his pals, and are rather silly. The CD ends with a fun dance mix of Scooby-Doo music and quotes. A lot of the music on this CD isn't particularly good, but it's a fun nostalgia trip."
5,This is SO cute!,"One of my little kids I teach dance too gave me this for Christmas (Aww!) and it's such a fun CD. Granted, it's not the one I grab for when I'm listening to something out of class, but I frequently use it in classes with little kids. You get all the Scooby Doo themes, plus tons of songs from the shows. There is even a Scooby Doo club mix! When I was little, I watched the show a lot, and this CD really brings back memories. If you have a little kid in your house (4-7 years), or if you just want a real fun nostalgia trip, this is the CD for you! Don't want to buy it? Would you do it for a scooby snack . . ."
2,This was disappointing.,"Judging from the description of this product, I thought that the tracks on the CD included the background music from the Scooby-Doo cartoon in addition to the select episodes. What the CD actually has are just those songs sung from some TV episodes like ""Jeepers! It's the Creeper!"", intro music from the different seasons and music from the Scooby-Doo movies, but none of what I was expecting to hear. The CD is still okay; I even like the booklet with the full names and profiles of Scooby and ""those meddling kids"" we've come to know and love. I just misunderstood the product description; I'm such a big Scooby fan, when I see something Scooby, I just ""click"" to get it. For what I was expecting, I was disappointed, but I'm sure many Scooby fans will love this so I recommend it for them, my fellow Scooby fans."
3,Some nice titles themes but not much else.,"Hey, I love the Scooby Doo title songs. I'm always whistling them. This fun 19-track CD gathers 5 titles songs and a 'Scooby Doo Club Mix' (!) among 13 lame '60s folk songs. No one apart from the REALLY nerdy or hippy will be interested in these. A few funny clips of dialogue from the show pop up sporadically but you won't catch 'em unless you stick out the beatnik stuff.It's cute release if you can pick it up cheap."
4,something out of the ordinary: humorous poetry,"the booklist review above is pretty accurate, but i thought i'd add my 2 cents. this collection is quite good, although it should be noted that humorous doesn't necessarily mean light. goodman has a knack for unlikely juxtapositions and clearly loves playing with language in the form of non sequiturs and malapropisms. at their best, as in ""yeast"" which is a play on the poet yeats and in ""touchdown to college!"" which starts off as a badly spelled essay and which morphs unexpectedly into beautiful poetry, the poems' results are strangely moving. a little too often his poetry is simply gimmicky, as in the series of movie castlists which feature ""max von sydow"" in a slew of roles, or the life of benjamin franklin, both of which quickly become rather predictable. a quick read for some good laughs and chuckles, as well some moments of emotional reaction."
3,Yee haw,"Over the top but fun, you never really know what to expect next with Preacher. Violence, cussing, sex, all kinds of good stuff! The cover artwork is killer."
5,I hope the World Never Ends...,"I hope the World never ends if Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon keep on turning out masterpieces like Until The End Of The World which is the best in the Preacher series. It's weird and incredible and in chapters like All In The Family, it shows just how twisted the world is. A couple of chapters later, Jesse and Tulip kiss and realize that even if the world is that twisted, they can live with it as long as they have each other."
2,Erroneus and very outdated description of some hikes,"I have been using this book when trekking in P&B in 1996. I have found many treks (in Colca Canyon, Cordillera Real for example) to be erroneus and very outdated (15 years at least regarding Colca). I've checked later editions (but not this one) and they didn't change a thing What's good about this book is that it at least tells you were you can possibly trek, but be very carefull later and don't trust the book to much or you'll be in trouble"
4,I found this guide to be a thorough and encompassing read.,"I spent a total of two months in Bolivia, and 'Backpacking and Trekking...' was my constant companion. Perhaps most useful were the national parks sections written by John Dirkson. Although some of the telphone numbers were outdated, the maps and detailed route information were excellent. Thanks to Bradt Publications."
4,These are Good,"These movies are funny What a tangled situation these seven charecters are in.Who would believe a movie about an ex-wife and a new wife could be so funny.I could see Barbera jean as the Mom,Cheyenne being her Daughter and Van being the Son what a great movie that would make.They are all such airheads."
5,"Great printer, never had any problems!","I purchased this printer in 2005 (my OS is Windows XP). I have NEVER had any problems with it. The print quality is excellent, the fax, copier and scanner work great, and it prints beautiful color/black & white photos. My printer even survived Hurricane Katrina and still works great! It also prints beautiful greeting cards too!"
1,Problems with install on XP,"The 2610 printer is a USB device. The installation disk asks for an XP SP2 disk, for USB print drivers. Who has an SP2 disk? My SP2 came from the net and I didn't get the the drivers. HP service said my XP upgrade was faulty. Even if it was why doesn't the install disk (all 1+ hour of it) come with drivers. Do I now wait 3-4 weeks to get the SP2 disk from Microsoft?"
2,Good printer for light use. Poor tech support.,"Very good quality prints. Ink cartridges can be quite costly so best for low volume use. The fax function requires that you scan the pages one at a time which would be time consuming if you need to fax more than a few pages. My biggest complaint is that when I had a minor problem with the printer and I called customer service, I was told that since my warranty was expired, they would charge me $60-$80 JUST TALK TO TECH SUPPORT! Then they suggested that I might as well just buy a new printer from them for $99!!! I'm not sure how that was supposed to help me send the fax that I needed to transmit that day! Meanwhile, I managed to fix the problem just by turning it off and on again. Sheehhh!"
1,Nightmare!,"This product claims to be compatible with Windows 98. When I installed the software, my computer became totally messed up. I spent DAYS online and on the phone with their tech people and ended up getting nowhere. My computer kept locking up, I couldn't load any software for printers because the computer kept telling me the ports were no longer there, many of my programs would not even work and all my data was lost. I ended up having to get a whole new computer. Their tech support was useless and their corporate office told me basically ""tough luck"", and refused to do anything. Totally ruined my $1,400 computer! Don't buy this (or anything else from HP since they refuse to make good on damage their products cause)."
5,Unbelievable product - VERY SATISFIED,"I bought this product as a last resort for a couch that had 6 month-old cat stains on it and had been sitting in our garage after numerous failed cleaning attempts. After following the directions, and applying a second time to the heavier stained areas, the smell was nearly gone after waiting one weekend for the cleaner to do its work! I was amazed. Now this old couch has new life thanks to this product and can be used again. THANK YOU!!!"
2,Not what it claims,"I rescue pets and recently rescued a Chihuahua mix who is marking on our bedroom door moulding. This product actually seemed to enhance the pee smell. I realize no product is going to completely eliminate any urine; however, I've had better luck with Nature's Miracle and a carpet shampooer."
5,knife sharpener,"purchased one of these at a gun show, many years ago. been looking for another for quite some time, when i found this on amazon. price is right and the item works. it's also very easy to use. purchased as gifts and spare ones for me. easiest sharpener to use, without having to plug it in..."
3,It's okay,Sharpened well enough but left rough spots. Good to use in a pinch but I will continue to look for one that I feel comfortable using on my kitchen knives. Will not recommend.
1,BEWARE: NOT Compatible with DWS7085 LED Light or DW7187 Laser System!!!,"I ordered this saw along with the DWS7085 LED work light system together because everything on Amazon and DeWalt's website say they are compatible. However, they are not. This saw is a Type 3 (which is not indicated on the site nor on the box itself), which no longer supports the LED or laser addition. I called DeWalt's call center and they gave me the number to their service center (3 hours away) and said I would have to take it there to swap (downgrade) to the previous Type 2 model. I then called the service center and they informed me that they don't do that and didn't understand why the call center would send me to them. So at this point I am simply getting the run-a-round from DeWalt and it seems my only option is to return everything to Amazon and go with another brand."
4,"A new, safe saw",This miter saw is powerful and accurate. The model I received was supposed to accept a light/cutting guide attachment and was not as advertised. I returned the light with no problem but have no cutting guide.
2,Not Compatible with DEWALT DWS7085 Miter-Saw LED Work Light System,"Other review's do a good job explaining the functionality of the saw - and the current price is good. The problem is that the saw shipped by Amazon and found now in most stores is a ""Type 3"" The current saw is NOT compatible with the DEWALT DWS7085 Miter-Saw LED Work Light System. I gave the saw 2 stars because on Amazon's web site and Dewalt's state that it IS compatible. The representative's at Dewalt's phone center our very ware of the problem and they also wished that there own website would be updated. A second rep told me the change was a cost savings initiative by Dewalt.I am very disappointed with the misrepresentation because some people like myself may have bought the saw at a good price and where waiting to buy the LED light when it was also cheap. I got lucky and found out early."
3,Sennheiser HDR120,"These were a replacement pair for my HDR140, they work OK with my RS140 transmitter but are not the quality of the 140 and they are on the ear and not over the ear. I am not sure why they do not make the 140 any longer. It seems everything is getting cheaper even brands as this."
2,"Less About Elephants, More About Bureaucracy & Ego","No one should dispute Leakey's dedication to the wildlife and people of his native Kenya. This book, however, is a rather dull account of the political intrigue and manouvering Leakey faced from 1989 to 1994 when he was involved with Kenya's various wildlife services. Those in the field may value his insights and perseverance, but the average reader may find his grandstanding and, at times, painstaking defensiveness a bit hard to stomach. I'd much rather read a book by those out in the field (such as rangers) who saw the elephants every day and who would have many a tale to tell about fighting off poachers and dealing with tourists and natives. Leave this book for the bureaucrats in world wildlife agencies."
4,Pretty good,"Very nice clock. Although sound is a little thin (but what do you expect from a clock radio), it's very clean and detailed. CD transport works very well, plays all my CD-Rs and RWs without a hitch. Pros: Big display (easy to read), digital tuner, nice button layout, very easy to set the alarms, brightness control (although manual.) Cons: cannot set alarms separately for weekdays/weekends, no gentle wake, very brights not-dimmable LEDs that shine brigther that the LCD screen itself, need a longer FM antenna for better reception.I'm returning it to get the next model in line (ICF-CD863V), which has automatic dimmer control, gentle wake, and slightly better sound."
1,Useless prodcut - it turns off after two minutes,"The JBL speaker sounds good but they automatically shut off after 2 minutes if there is no signal detected to save power. These shut off while I'm playing a computer game that has constant sounds so they are useless. Also, the volume control knob is cheap and difficult to adjust the volume. A poorly designed product that doesn't work."
2,"Great for loud music, Awful for soft classical, acoustic","These speakers crackle when plugged into my laptop. If I unplug my laptop the crackling is reduced, but still perceptible when playing soft music. For loud music, these deliver a nice sound quality; but the crackling drives me nuts when I'm playing soft piano, acoustic, classical guitar, or really anything without enough ""wall of sound"" to drown out the crackle. I would have bought other speakers if I'd known."
2,"nice speakers, but...","The sound quality is very good from these speakers and they look very nice. But I have two issues with them.There is an auto on/off that functions when there is a signal to them. It is a great idea because then you don't have to turn them off and on. But if the volume is not up all the way from the input they don't turn on, and sometimes will just turn themselves off. Also, sometimes they don't turn on even though music is playing with volume up all the way, so then you have to turn them off and back on. And if watching youtube or something, you have to turn off and on again because it is somewhere around a 30 second delay to auto off.Second, I purchased these in August of 2011. They just stopped working this week. So I got 14 months use out of them, just outside the warranty period."
1,Don't bother,"These speakers arrived yesterday. When I hooked them up, they only produced a shrill whine. I called customer service. He sounded like an idiot. Told me to try plugging into the earphone outlet. Then told me to ship them back and he would ship a replacement. I need them now to study online lectures with, so I told him to forget it. If you want something that works out of the box, don't buy these."
1,expected more from JBL,"garbled,distorted sound with fade in and out. Now I have to spring for return postage."
1,Very poor quality and very short warranty.,"I bought two pairs of it. Both stopped working a little over a year. One pair lose one channel. The other pair became completely silent. This product seems have design flaws. And JBL only offer one year warranty, what a shame."
3,Work great for the first 6 months (review based on 2 purchases),"When they work they work great. Full sound, way way better than the build in speakers. After about 6 months I started to have to tweak with the audio cable because only 1 speaker was working. The tweaking started to be needed more often until it stopped working and I could hear sound only from 1 speaker. So I bought a new pair of speakers hoping that I just got a defective pair (and also because they are so inexpensive). After the first 6 months when they worked great now I have to tweak again with the cable because they stop working (this time both of them, even more annoying, especially when I am far from the laptop cooking and sentences get cut in the middle of my listening). It is not a problem with my laptop because when I use headset I never have issues.Now I am shopping for a new pair, no I will not buy these for the third time."
3,Average Speakers,"These speakers are okay but I have paid less for better. The sound quality is fine, the volume just doesn't go high enough for me. That is my only complaint. I don't know enough about speakers to know if it is because there are just two speakers where I previously had three or what. I just want them to be louder."
5,quality product for the price,"For the price, these speakers are great. I find the sound quality to be excellent...these were a wonderful option for my Macbook, as the speakers on it can be hard to hear.As others have mentioned, the power/volume knob is somewhat slippery and thus hard to turn. However, I simply leave my speakers on and use the computer's volume controls."
3,"Good quality, short life","I was very happy when I purchased these speakers. In my view these are the best 2.0 speakers available in the market as far as sound quality is concerned. But one of the speakers stopped working after less than 2 mths of use. Now I am trying to get it replaced. May be mine was one off case where they didnt last but that was my experience with'em. Otherwise very good looking, good quality, compact speakers."
4,Great sound for lightweight speakers,I wanted speakers that sounded good and were also light weight and small. These fit the bill and the sound is much better than less expensive computer speakers that I've had in the past.
5,I love...,"I love these little speakers! I have noticed no problems, feedback, or other issues with them. I have been using them for over a year hooked to my laptop. They are GREAT!"
2,Terrible Static Noise,"I agree with Brooke Allen very much. This speaker is terrible. The noise due to alternate electric is very anoying. If you tune up volumn to max, you will find it is as loud as a hungry bee... I'm going to return it very soon."
4,Great match for our Mac Mini,"We needed some new speakers for our Mac Mini, and these have worked out great. Nice sound, and they don't take up a lot of space. Plus, the white matches the rest of the components."
5,"The crunchy, thirst-quenching tang of live dung-beetles","What a fine thing to publish these in one volume! Tutuola's best, these stories are without precedent -- seriously, no matter how you tie them back into traditional Yoruba folktales -- if they are rooted in a Nigerian cultural undermind, what Tutuola's unique imagination did to them produced seeds, stems and flowers heretofore unseen. Read them, read them to your lover, read them to your children, read them to your dying grandmother, to your dog, to your plants, to random strangers..."
4,"Good music ""to do things""","I heard the title track, ""Cavatina,"" on my local public radio station and thought it was so pretty I searched for it knowing only that word and the artist for that song. I was surprised at the very low cost--maybe it's been around too long. But it's a good CD. The music is guitar, much of it classically flavored and played very well. The fact it's a tribute to Robert DeNiro is puzzling to me--the liner notes don't explain that. But a number of the tunes are, like Cavatina, pretty. It's the type of music that you can put through your headphones while you're doing something else; I think my daughter would find it good for her job as a data entry clerk. It's a good few notches above elevator music, but not a top-of-the charts type of CD."
3,Pretty pictures,"This book is a photo album of great blue herons and related birds. Allen is a novelist and journalist based in Wisconsin. In this book, he provides some background information to accompany a collection of heron photos. Topics covered in the text include feeding, family life, the great blue heron's future, and some mentions of myths involving herons or related birds. The book is amply illustrated with colored photographs of herons and related birds. End material includes a brief list of sources.I found the text of this book a bit superficial and not very informative. The text answered a few of my questions, but mainly floated around the topics without getting to the specific facts of what is known about herons or their behavior. In general, the photographs are quite attractive, although a few have an inconvenient layout centered on the seam between the pages. If you're a hardcore heron fan who knows very little about birds in general, you may find the book of interest."
5,1986 NCAA Div. I Men's Basketball,"Excellent movie, rare recording of Len Bias who was a true rising star! Unfortunately, he left us way too soon. But he did leave us a lesson that we and all b'ball players to learn. Just say No, and then run!"
4,"Good grinder, but it ain't wrench free","This is a great budget grinder. I used it with a diamond wheel to cut out grout on about 40 sf of floor tile. Put it through the wringer at load with lots of dust for a few hours and had no trouble. I've cut several other large pieces of metal, pipes, etc. Works like a charm. Bearings are a bit noisy but it doesn't seem to cause a problem.I do NOT think this is ""wrench free"" as DeWalt claims. It includes a wrench and the instructions do not explain how to remove the wheel without a wrench. I don't think it can be done. (Please post and tell me how if it can!) My other complaint is that the instructions are terrible, like all DeWalt instructions. It's so confusing to try to figure out what applies to this model and what does not, what is the right type of wheel, when a separate guard not included might be needed, etc."
3,Not so happy,I own all kinds of DeWalt power tools and have been satisfied with all except this one. It has all the power I needed and everything else works fine but... the switch sticks in the on position. I bought it to use with a wood carving attachment and it does a good job of handling that. I have not had much luck with getting a replacement as yet.
3,"good read, but not good value","I like this magazine, it's smart and funny. However, it only comes out every other month, and it is very slim. I have to say, I won't be renewing, as I have better uses for the money (it wasn't the cheapest magazine on amazon.com, for sure).But I would recommend it for a gift, and in fact I'm wondering why I didn't do that last xmas. :)"
4,"Thought provoking, but not too serious","Finally! A magazine that does not insult your intelligence, but is still fun. This is not just another magazine full of whiners with good vocabularies. It will inform, but still laugh at itself. Fun reading for the thinking person, who doesn't care what Britney Spears is doing!"
4,great and interesting magazine,This is very different then your average magazine. It has random facts that can be enjoyable to anyone interested in learning.My only complaint is the price and the limited amount of issues per subscription.Worth trying out!
3,"Anything with ""Pony"" in it . . .",". . . you just about have to figure is going to be light (or country), and this ensemble from London is all that, soft pop songs highlighted by acoustics and a rhythm line right out of Nashville, with some touches of Cure from the very pop spectrum. That said, the various songs are pleasant enough, ""Slumming"" moves right along, and the female vocals, at least, please the ears. But it's so fey and fluffy that I just can't see the reason for it to exist at all.Oh boy, another CD full of soft folk rock ballads. Sorry, maybe it's not fair to trash an album that is essentially professional and pleasant just because you don't appreciate the genre, but what is the point of treading this ground again anyway? But if you like this sort of thing you should probably pick it up, everything here is very pleasant to the ears."
1,mUSHROOM hEAD!!! LMFAO!!!,I will never buy a helmet off of the internet again...This is the 3 helmet i've sent back. I Had A mUSHROOM hEAD!!! LMFAO!!!
4,stress relief,"This is a great album to play when you're highly stressed and/or highly angry just need to let go. Very hard, angry music and lyrics. Good release music. Sounds like the angry music of 1994, not today's pop music wannabees."
3,"didnt go into detail, brief description, very short","it shouldnt take you anymore than 30 minutes to read this book. it's very short, didn't go into detail, just told the basic facts about the cathedral and it's construction. i didn't think it was terribly well written and could've used less pictures and more words. though it didn't go into much detail it still gave the important facts about the cathedral and i thought it was informative and well researched."
4,birthday!!,"ok what kid or adult would not like to be noticed on their birthday?? What a great way to announce to the world its their birthday! A great, easy and inexpensive way to make someone feel special on their special day."
2,tedious,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is basically a 90's version of Bright Lights, Big City. Again, we have the protagonist who's trying to realize big dreams but lacks the determination to make them come true, and we also have the used-to-be-sweet-and-is-now-a-cold model wife. Furthermore, the style of writing, which seemed hip and clever when I read Bright Lights at age 17, now seems tedious and too-clever-for-its-own-good at age 30. I'm not sure if this is because I'm now older or if perhaps Bright Lights' style has been imitated so much that it's now almost a cliche.The only part of the book that really came alive was the dinner scene at the restaurant when the hero's father has a tantrum at the table and drops his pants. It showed just what a good writer McInerney can be, and unfortunately it showed just how mediocre the rest of the book is."
2,"Unremarkable, re-tread blah from Easton Ellis-wannabe","There's nothing wrong with writing fun, 90's-style fiction, but can't anyone do better than this? If this was some nobody's first novel, and not the oh-yeah-Bright-Lights guy, it would never have been published. It's nothing but an unamusing, amateurish rip-off of American Psycho minus the blood and guts. Even if youre tempted, starved for good current fiction, please, at least wait for the paperback -- to show up at a used book store. You'll thank me later. Oh, but you will get a variety of wildly implausible albeit unimaginative subplots that add nothing to the story other than momentarily distracting our shallow, bland protagonist. Quick, before any more aging one-hit wonders are encouraged by the smell of a fast buck, can't some clever, with-it young or old author write a fun, topical literary novel? I think we're clear on who can't."
3,It's hard to listen whole tracks.,"My first impression of this album was that this is sounds like sound track of japanese horror movies. What made me listen so hard is that sound and piece itself. However great orchestra and Japanese traditional instruments and voices and synths play this dynamic piece, it only made me feel scary. I was expected more people-relatable album for him. But it ain't happening. I think people who like 20 century contemporary classic might like this album."
5,Kitschy Fun,"This book is now a collector's item because of the picture of the World Trade Center. Buy it quickly. The images were nice, but the scratch and sniff stickers make the book. Everyone can smell and see the beautiful city. I think the place is much nicer after the reign of Rudy Guilliani, but it still smells in more than a few places. This book celebrates the real New York."
2,gasket set,Most of the parts fit. One gasket was not the correct one for this carb. Disappointing..all parts should be correct.
