4,Good speakers,"Pros: Good speakers, good range, remote is a nice feature.Cons: Uses 6C batteries per speaker, audio device has to be on 50-75% volume before it will connect to the wireless speakers. Not much bass, but quality sound for size.I use them mostly with my mp3 player & computer, but have connected them to tv."
4,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,I bought these June of 2008. I did not want to write a review until we tested them for awhile. Its been 6 months now and we have enjoyed them very much. The only issues we have had is every once and awhile they get a little interference and the sound goes out but it only last for a second or two and the remote control is a little sensitive. Other than that they are great. We use these speakers all over the house inside and out. They worked great this year also for Halloween as we set them outside hidden in the front yard playing scary Halloween sounds. I would recommend this product.
1,Here's the BAD,"I like the sound & wireless option BUT this system had fritzed out on me during parties as well as general listening and no combo of actions has gotten it back on track. Also when they work, the speakers loose the connection randomly, then it returns in seconds or minutes.VERY much a BUMMER!They are truely too good to be true."
1,Nice looking but not nice sounding!,Interference from nearby other electronic items caused significant sound distortion. I reurned this item as being unacceptable for my area conditions.
4,Good product,"The wireless speaker system is very elegant looking, the sound is good as well as the reception. The only caveat is the fact that the output is only 5W/10Watt. I wish it had stronger output. The other item that is worth considering is the headset by Audio Unlimited, it comes with its own reception base, thus you can have two separated devices (Ipods or MP3) connected to two reception bases."
5,Wireless Solves Problem Beautifully,"My son sent me a pair of computer speakers and I discovered marvelous music sources online. My wife wanted speakersin our bedroom which is about 25 feet from my computer. The topology made running a cable very impractical if notimpossible. I was unaware of wireless speakers but on checking Amazon's always fantastic offerings there they were.The order processing and shipping could not have been better. The speakers function perfectly and their sound is more than satisfactory. Each unit is self contained, complete with it's own receiver, power supply, and amplifier.For complete portability they have a battery compartment for 6 C batteries and hence can be operated anywhere,evenwhile being carried. They are not stereo. They have no audio input and so can only be used with their own wirelessunit. On the whole, A GREAT BUY! Thank you so much Audio Unlimited and Amazon."
4,Fit the bill.,I purchased this as a gift and set the speakers up for the convenience of the person I gave them to. They worked fine. I do not recommend using the speakers with all those 12 C batteries. The batteries do no last long and the speakers begin to fade in and out. Use the plug-ins provided. I wish the remote turned the speakers on and off. The power has to be turned on and off manually with each use.
3,Not that great,"These speakers worked fine in the next room from where I had placed the receiver, but the main purpose of my purchase was to have them outside, to listen to music, etc. After much time spent trying to figure out just the right position/place for them, I finally gave up. Bottom line is, they look nice, they put of decent sound, and they're not very expensive, but they need to be placed close to the receiver for them to work well."
1,Barely audible,"I really had high hopes for these speakers. They are very good looking, but when they arrived, the included audio cable did not work. Not a big deal, I had an old one from an old set of wireless speakers. Once I got them working though, even at the highest volume you could not hear them from more than 3 feet away. Based on other reviews, I can only assume that my speakers were defective. I had to return them. On a positive note, the return process is really easy."
2,worked for while then one of the speakers just died,"When they were new, sound quality was decent, as was range, but then the batteries get used up quickly and the SQ goes down with it. you can use the included adapter, but that defeats the wireless point.remote cant turn them on, and volume adjustment is independent of each speaker (not in stereo)today, one of the speakers just died!good esthetic design thoughupdate 12/14/08Amazon and Cables unlimited have been great about exchanging the defective speakers, even though it was right at the warranty end (1yr). i noticed the replacements say cables unlimited on them instead of velocity wireless, they look the same, but seem to sound a lot better, than the original. for that, i would upgrade to maybe 3.5 stars, and even 4 if these last longer than the originals (call me in a year) :)"
3,Not everything works and compensation follow through lacks,"I absolutely love the speakers, or rather speaker. They were every I had hoped for except that one of the AC adapter plugs do not work, all I wanted was a replacement plug so everything would work as it should, instead I was offered either a whole new unit of course I would have to pay to return the one I have or a 20% discount on the price I paid (which would have been a whole lot less than the shipping costs). When I finally made a decision the link was deactivated and I tried to reprocess the claim. I never did get any satisfaction from Amazon and I suppose I never will. I recommend finding a reputable dealer so you can get all the working parts and forget Amazon for this product, but I do highly recommend the speakers, I use them every day!! The sound is really good."
4,Wireless Speakers,"These speakers have great sound, easy to install and use. Only bad thing is everytime you cut them on you have to adjust the sound wish it would stay where I left it last. This is a great product to not have wires all around the house."
3,Billie Jack,"It pops & cracks when you turn your T.V off. The sound go off when you turn the volume down, so you have to bring the sound up and switch to another channel to have the sound come back on."
2,Disappointed,Lots of problems w/ these speakers but the deal breakers are 1) the auto shutoff power saving feature is horrible. You have to have the audio source set high for the receiver to kick on and the audio source has to be constant so if you ever plug the speakers into a computer the activity of day to day business will not be enough to keep them on 2) the transmitter needs a battery power option. It would be nice for true mobility for say and iPod or something like that. 3) overall sound quality and ascetics could be better. 4) Power button on remote doesn't turn speakers on - only off (go figure). No way of telling how load you have set each speaker - you just push the button a bunch and listen to see if they are balanced. // Not happy w/ the speakers I would have rather spent more for better speakers.
4,Best for sending TV audio around your home,"Not emphasized in the product description is that the sound transmitted is monaural.I listen to (too many) news/politics shows in the evening, and want to be able to hear the narrative as I move about in several rooms, but don't need to see the video... or use the electricity of simultaneous screens.I now have the opportunity for transmitted vocal content at my desk and in my bedroom without having to linger in front of the den or kitchen TV.Because my TV has no audio-out connector, the IN-put to the transmitter required using the headphone jack on the TV. Sadly, that automatically mutes the TV's own speakers, and I had to use a splitter and attach ANOTHER speaker behind the set (scavenged from a prior computer's)."
3,AU Wireless Speakers,"The short of it - expensive, mediocre sound quality, ""wireless"" considering you have to plug them in (or use 6 D-cell batteries for each one), remote can not turn them on, only off/up/down/tune.Conclusions - look elsewhere unless you only listen to very quiet music with no high band frequencies."
4,Steve,"Just bought these speakers and they arrived today. They are sweet so far. Well worth the money. Great sound, easy installation. Works with my computer, phone, tv or stereo."
4,Fast Shipping,"I needed this DVD in a hurry for class. It was shipped promptly and in the condition promised. Also, hard video to find but was found on Amazon. I highly recommend Amazon for hard to find items. Docudrama is great teaching tool for Family Violence."
2,NO WHEELS IN THIS SET!,"One of the pictures on amazon submitted by the same person (I'm only guessing he works at Kaplan) showed the wrong box! I bought this set because ""Billy D"" who submitted all the pictures showed the box with a car, and window on it! We need the wheels! My son is going to be disappointed... Billy D if you work for Kaplan - remove the picture of the box with the wheels and window! That's what we wanted and didn't get!Good price for bulk duplo pieces though."
4,Good starter set for the price,This was a good starter set. However I would have liked iot to come in a a reusable container instead of just the shipping box. And I would have liked a little pamphlet with ideas/instructions for building a few things.
4,lego duplo brick set,Good set of duplos. Good price for the quantity of duplos--better than any deal I could find at the stores.
3,Nice bible for Church,"I ordered this bible thinking if was bound in leather. This was misleading as on the rear cover is printed ""leather like"" meaning vynll. The sellers done nothing to correct this when I emailed them. Otherwise this bible is aesy to read and it is very reasonably priced."
2,"If you aren't breastfeeding, it probably isn't for you","The book has good advice in many sections, but it pushes breastfeeding so hard that it annoyed me so I stopped reading. There were quite a few areas of the book that were all about scaring a new parent into believing what the authors believe. A shame that it is so heavy-handed in parts, because in other areas it is a nice book.If you (or your partner, rather) plan to breastfeed, then you'll probably like this book. If not, it's probably not the book for you - I felt like it was trying to convince me that any mother who doesn't breastfeed is neglecting their child horribly (which of course isn't true)."
3,Not as good as I thougth,"This book is hard for my 13 month old to understand. The ""Hello"" part of the book goes half way into the book and then you need to close the book and turn it upside down and start the ""Goodbye"" part. He isn't used to that and has a hard time sitting down and looking through it.It is still a good book, but not age appropriate."
1,Where's the piano?,"I remember when Lori Line played at Dayton's and was just getting her career started. She played beautifully. Line should stick with the type of music that made her popular. Her pop orchestra drowns her playing out, and all the other ""extras"" in this CD are too distracting. I can hardly hear her piano, which is the reason I buy her CDs. When I heard a portion of Three Dog Night's ""Joy to the World"" blended into the holiday version - what does this have to do with the Holiday - it was just too much.Save your money on this CD and spend it wisely on others, such as David Lanz, Jim Brickman, George Winston, etc."
3,Standard Cable video fare,"This is the fourth DVD in the series and is not significant in anyway from the other DVD in the series. The series is best described as a mini-series, although it has a few redeeming moments, mainly in the fantasy settings, the series appears to be an attempt to create a continueing storyline along the lines of the old serials, however, the acting never brings you in and although there is full nudity, the erotic scenes are mediocre at best. It is possible though that the fantasy settings may appeal to people who like romance novels. I marginally recommend this DVD, but only if you get the whole series. It is significantly better that way as it at least gives the illusion of a serial, rather then just a bad movie. - Just My opinion..."
1,JUNK!!!! Toy manufacturer should be ashamed!!!!,"My 7 yr old talked about getting a claw machine for months. We were happy when we found this one and filled it and put it under the tree for Christmas. He asked Santa, at every opportunity, for a claw machine. Fast forward to Christmas day and the most anticipated toy. My son used it for a total of 5 minutes and it stopped working. I felt so bad for my son who was so disappointed and crying on Christmas morning. It was sent back and we bought another one. My son was so excited. He and his little brother spent about a half hour playing with the new one and once again......it broke!What a piece of JUNK!! This shouldn't be sold if they can't make one that works."
3,It's okay,It was difficult to set up. You had to unscrew the top to get it off and take the plastic off of the claw. Once that was done you had to be careful with the wires and screw the lid back on. It was very tedious with a lot of screws. My 3 year old nephew had little patience for how long this took. Once that was all done it did work nicely. Just a pain to get set up and going.
4,The Claw is fun...but loud!,"The best thing I've bought for the granddaughters and their friends yet! I just wish we could find a way to turn the volume of the music down. They would play with it for hours, but the adults can't relax in the next room, because the music is so invasive."
3,Ok,"My daughter has been dying for one of these. She really enjoyed playing it and it wasn't too hard yet difficult enough to be a challenge. After only a couple days of playing it stopped working, though. We bought new batteries and she hasn't even tried replacing them yet to see if that was the problem (even though we put new batteries in and she didn't play it THAT much). She has already lost interest in it."
4,"Good toy, but some downs about it. (MUST SEE!)","Well, my brothers LOVE it. He wants to play it every second of the day! I personally think that the music is a little loud, and the claw is kind of slow. Also the hole where you put the candy in, is kind of small. You can't really pick up big things like little bags of candy[3 inch]. Shipping was fast, came 4 days after ordering online. Good packaging, and I give it a solid 'B'."
2,Horrible!,This product was no good! It worked for a half hour and then died. I would suggest not to buy this product. It was fun while it lasted until it stopped working.
1,Piece of Crap,"Ordered this as a Christmas present for my son. The joystick that controls the crane going up/down did not work. Sent it back and ordered a replacement. The joystick that controls the crane moving right/left does not work on the replacement. Sending that back too. Also, the actual crane comes covered in a plastic bag that is difficult to remove since there is only a small opening to put toys into the machine. This has resulted in the bacg becoming stuck inside the machine. I gues if the controls worked properly you could remove the bag with the claw. The top does not remove. Piece of crap!"
4,Good for teaching reading,"This is a GREAT curriculum for teaching reading. I got it bc my son needed help with spelling bc he had never learned phonics rules of spelling, but he is already an avid reader. For the purpose to help with spelling for someone already a fluent reader with a good vocabulary this program is not as hlepful bc it does not focus on spelling only. But, Saxon Phonics is great for teaching to read!! I have used thier phonics with my younger son and he is a great reader and speller!"
1,RIP OFF Book,"None of the songs in this book are written in the way that Vanessa plays it on the CD. All of it is just the melody of the song and some chords added to it. Some of the lyrics don't even match up to what she really sings (ex. in ""Who's to Say,"" the book said 'who's to say that this is not our love' when on the cd it's 'who's to say this is not enough')I was extremely disappointed, with this book, especially since Vanessa's first book (Be Not Nobody) was true to the CD. I don't know what happend to this one. If you would like to buy the actual version of the songs that Vanessa plays, get it somewhere else."
1,Got what I paid for!,"I planned to use this product in our wine cooler, as it could stick to the door's window and be plainly visible from outside. (I already had a smaller digital hygrometer, but it was hard to see.) This product's readings are way off; for example:Outdoors: Weather Channel = 17%, digital = 16%, Timex = 45%Indoors (as I write this): digital = 41%, Timex = 60%I tried rotating the dial within the suction housing that it fits into in an effort to ""calibrate"" it to the digital hygrometer, but it still doesn't accurately track humidity as conditions change.Although returning a $5.00 product may not make sense from an economic standpoint, this one is worthless enough that I'm doing so on principle! I've always been satisfied with products I've purchased from Amazon, but this one deserves to be dropped from your site."
4,Trade-Offs...,"First of all, the gloves I received were different from the picture here. The palm is entirely smooth, no stitching. So until they break in a bit, the palms tend to bulge OUT when closing your fist. These run SMALL due to the thick foam/gel/whatever construction. Order a size LARGER that normal! Like another reviewer stated, these are NOT for small hands. The padding is so thick that you would compromise the strength of your grip just overcoming the padding. They are great for LARGE handled tools (jackhammers, hammer drills, etc.), but forget it for anything else. They are just too thick for any kind of tactile feel."
3,cassius rocks out atari style,"cassius new album ""au reve"" is a more tech heavy pursuit than its predecessor ""1999"". atari bleeps and bloops swirl in and out but never take away from the sophisticated melodies and taught rhythyms.the whole album has a messy, underground sound to it, which i love considering how sterile and devoid the majority of dance music has become.like the landmark ""discovery"" from daft punk, cassius has persued more rock sounds on this album...the electric guitar stands very prominent on many tracks...time will tell if this was a wise road to follow, but for now especially on the lovely ""nothing"" it adds a pink-floyd vibe to the album, which i enjoyed.overall, if you a fan of AIR, DAFT PUNK, and CASSIUS last release...you will be pleased with this purchase."
2,Cassius - Au Rve,"The disco aesthetic has always been a part of the French house scene, and it certainly played a part in Cassius' first album, 1999. On their new album, Au Reve, however, disco seems to have taken over entirely -- and not necessarily in a good way. Ghostface Killah from the Wu-Tang Clan puts in an appearance, and while is flow is fine, the final product sounds like a hip-house project from the late 80s, when such a thing was new. Now, however, it just sounds tired. ""Telephone Love"" shows a little inventiveness, but not even the might Jocelyn Brown can save ""I'm A Woman, "" which becomes generic diva house. ""20 Years (How Do You See Me Now)"" isn't completely realized, while ""Au Reve"" don't really go anywhere. I was really hoping for more, especially since Cassius is of Motorbass -- now there's something to dream about."
5,There were air raids,"Our South African friend should have checked the history books before making his attack on the verisimilitude of this author. The Germans did indeed mount several air raids on London during the Great War. Many of these were by Zeppelin, but some were also by aeroplanes. I believe the first raid occurred in 1915."
3,Good Ending to a Great Series,"With her cool, incisive prose, Pat Barker closes out her World War I trilogy. Though this is the one that won her the Booker Prize, my suspicion the award was more for the achievement of the triolgy than this single novel. Rewarding enough as a stand-alone, it is the least compelling of the three books; there is a long sidetrack to life and death among natives in the Pacific Isles to drive home her points about men, death and war that does the job, but the main story does it all so clearly it hardly seems necessary. And it's that main story, following the inner lives of a psychiatrist and the patient he ""fixed up"" and sent back to the front, that wrenches you from head to toe. War is, indeed, hell, and Barker makes that point elegantly and beautifully through the eyes of Billy Prior. He makes the haunting walk down THE GHOST ROAD worthwhile all on his own."
2,bittersweet addition to my library,"i guess i bought this expecting too much. I read such good reviews about it, that i decided to give it a shot. Boy, was i let down. It has ABSOLUTELY NO plot!!! I supose if your just in the mood for words, then this is the book for you, but if you're looking to snuggle up with a nice story on a cold winters night, you might want to try a novel."
1,Not Interesting at All!,"I've heard of avant-garde writing, but this is ridiculous! First of all, there is no discernable plot. Second of all, no style - hard even to find a narrative ""voice"" although the author does adopt a scholarly, fairly arrogant tone that calls to mind Nabakov's ""Humpbert Humpbert."" All this is is words and, in some sad last look at modernism and its desire to classify, their ""meanings."" The words appear to be in alphabetical order, although I have not read all of this, and there are suggested techniques for speaking the words - the author's desire to impose him/herself (Merriam Webster? must be a woman) is wholly lacking in even basic awareness of cultural studies. Nevertheless, one does appreciate attempts at new literature. Still, I'd like to take this to the shed out back with my copy of ""Of Grammatology"" and deconstruct it."
5,I loved this musical!!!!,"This musical was amazing. I saw it in NY and fell in love with it. I came home from my trip and bought the cd the next day. I listen to it all the time, even in the car. I'll never get tired of hearing it!"
3,They are ok,"They appear ok. I ordered the 2 hook in hopes of gaining life out of my bras from yesteryear that were an inch or so smaller. However, I can't because the hooks are spaced too far apart from one another on the extender itself. The model pictured is wearing a thin strapped bra, whereas these extenders are more for the super heavy duty supportive undergarment. Be observant before purchase. And I think the shipping is a little pricey. They weigh absolutely nothing when shipped."
5,So comfortable my son kept them on all day!,These shoes were a terriffic deal at the sale price. My son had a soccer tournament this weekend and did not even take them off in between games (5 hours).
2,Please recomend for machine tools' handbook anybody?,"Now I sale a machine tools like Horizontal boring machine, flow forming machine, balancing machine, friction welding machine so and so in korea. I am looking for the book that explain almost all kind of machine tools. Could you recommend like this book?"
1,Disappointed,"I have been wearing Gucci Envy Me for the past five years and have purchased a number of bottles during that time. I love the scent. I always purchase from a department store and should have done so again! In an attempt to save money, I bought online and it is NOT the perfume I've been wearing for five years. This is either an old, expired bottle or it is not authentic. I won't be buying beauty products on Amazon ever again. Wish I never had since now I don't have the money to buy a true bottle of Envy Me!"
3,Not bad....Just not for me,"I guess I'm the minority here since everyone else loves this perfume. I'm not saying it's bad....just not something for me.I like clean & natural scents. This lasts a long time with just a little but it's way too strong for me & smells too ""purfume-ish"".I'll stick with my baby powder scents for now."
5,info.,My tracfone has good reception. i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id. if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 120 free minutes. please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral. it's a win/win! thanks
3,Nice to have,"This is the kind of record you dream about when you don't own it. It's a record of very good disco music, but then, it's not much more.If you want to groove, have it for yourself. It's GOOOD disco music, indeed - nothing more."
1,Horrible movie,This movie is horrible it should have a negative star rating. I rented it to compare to Edger Allen Poe's The Raven and it is so far on the cheesy side that it will not work for a comparison. Very bad start off and the whole movie is horrible.
1,Ads don't include usage restrictions!,"I purchased these pills to help with water retention. The ads fail to state that persons who have kidney disease or digestive problems should not take them. Also, pregnant or nursing women should not take them. After buying the pills I found out that I couldn't use them! Money wasted."
1,cut to hell - avoid,"Aside from Moffo, everyone else is cut to comprimario status. Campora loses his act 2 aria as well as the second part of his act 1 aria with the 8 (or sometimes 9) hi Cs. Unless you're a Moffo fan, this is to be avoided."
1,Disappointed - not much here about the real Germany,"I spent 10 years in Germany. Even though I worked for the American government, most of my friends and work colleagues were German and I lived far away from any American community. I traveled widely all around Germany and other parts of Europe and I spoke passable German.This ""documentary"" was not very representative of any part of my life experience or travels in Germany. It wasn't even at tourist level relevance. Did any Germans have a chance to critique this before they made it? I doubt it.Pass on this one. It makes me kind of suspicious of the whole Globe Trekker series that they would put this poor representation out there."
3,Hilarious - not for travel advice,"I recently watched this dvd because I am planning a trip to Germany and the surrounding countries. I've seen numerous other videos on Germany, read a few books, and watched it with a few people who have traveled there extensively.Needless to say at this point - this isn't really about touring Germany. It should be titled ""Weird stuff: Germany"". The host takes through a number of awkward encounters - from Berliners who ""pray to Lenin"" (I kid you not) Lenin ""you are the DJ ... show us the party!"" WHAT?!? I don't think I could find these people if I tried.Next, we travel to Sylt, little do we know the only reason we've traveled here is so our host can show you a ten-minute segment on nude beaches.And there is more to come! I kind of want to find the rest of our host's (Justine Shapiro) videos for comedic relief.Highly Recommended?"
3,Good information/ but with bad tast,"Ok first of all, if you going to have the host do a nude segment on a nude beech, then at least have a woman minus all the whale blubber down below. ""Of all the girls they could have picked""Of course Justine did a great service on the film directing the audience attention exploring what Germany has to offer such as trains rides, street tours, and the beer festival. She even whooped a guy with a loaf of bread when being pinched on the arse.I might add a bit more latter. Right now I can't think of anything interesting to say regarding an ungreatfull socialist country ""yeah I know we too are going down the same route"" that was built up by American money; and kept from starving though American Airpower. I hope some of those deeds wasn't lost in the German text book."
5,Good DVD,"this DVD is from the Globe trekker series, which is a series I have interest in a lot of tittles from. this DVD touches on some highlights of Germany much of what interested me. the DVD is clear and very good quality. very good for those liking the globe trakker series, as they 1nce were on Travel channel, but wish to have the show on recorded media."
4,Mixed Feelings,"The is an intriguing variation of the story of Gisi Perl (""Out Of The Ashes"").As one who has read 100's of Shoah memoirs, I thought this movie sounded like it'd be dynamite, and in fact, the story is gripping, the acting superb. The first DVD was so powerful, I stayed up till 7:30 a.m. watching it (and resented having to finally go to bed, LOL!).Yet, for all of that, ultimately, it's one long propaganda film (Goebbels, though he wouldn't approve of the message, would rate the propaganda skill as A+!). Especially the closing speech by Cady is a bromide (and ironic in the face of what was happening in Israel at that very time!)."
3,Cute story but very predictable,"I am an adult who loves mermaids and children's books. I was looking for something that would draw me into a fantasy world in the way Harry Potter does. This book was way too predictable for that and was also very focused on girl's insecurities. The second book in the series is much better! I probably would not have read it if I didn't buy them both at the same time, but I am looking forward to reading the ""Castle in the Mist"" now."
1,You call this strip club music?,"Only 2 maybe 3 songs on this cd qualifies as strip club music. ""B*Tch, Shake that A**"" from dj Boss Pimp is REAL strip club music, this ain't."
5,Next level,"There is something transcendental about this book... It really takes the Xanth series to the next level. Some people believe that Piers Anthony peaked right around Golem in the Gears but I think that he started to really take off in what he initially thought would be a new triology in 1987 (Vale of the Vole, Heaven Cent and Man from Mundania). I LOVE all Xanth novels, don't get me wrong, but his writing is much more relaxed in tone in these three than they had been in previous works. I really couldn't put Heaven Cent down and I read it in a couple of days which is good and bad (good because of the escapism but bad in that the experience was over too quickly). Maybe its so delicious for me because the Good Magician is on hiatus or simply because I love Dolph and his female quandry. Either way, this book rocks!"
5,I loved it,THis was the best book ever. It had a great plot and it was full of humor and excitement.
3,useful but biased,"Generally I find the Blue Guides to be the most intelligent guide books around. While I did find much useful information in this book there was an attitude that got on my nerves. Perhaps it was the frequent and disdainful references to the ""wars of religion"", just a bit too superior for my tastes. Also Marseilles conatains some very important examples of 19th and 20th architecture that receive little if any attention. Similarly the buildings by Le Corbusier and Norman Foster are not discussed. In short a quaint, conservative, waspy view of Provence."
4,Lyle doing what he does very well,".One thing about Lyle: whaen he does other people's songs, he does make them sound just like they're his own. Just as well, you might say, judging from recent releases.But for now, forget the fact that Lyle hasn't put out anything truly new for years and consider ""Smile"". Is it something to smile about?On the whole, yes it certainly is. The tracks on this album may well have been heard already in their respective movies, but do you know any of them? I doubt it. Except for the obvious ones like ""Blue Skies"" and ""Mac the Knife"" of course.There are some great songs, especially ""Walking Tall"", a song perfectly suited to Lyle's laid-back throaty delivery. But everything in this collection is delivered so nicely, you can't halp but like it, and if you like the cool jazzy sound of Lyle with his big band then you will like this. It contains some of Lyle's most listenable stuff to date. Who can blame him for putting it all on one CD?"
3,Only for Lyle diehards,"I adore Lyle Lovett and even his songs on a soundtrack will make me see a movie. But this album didn't click for me the way his others have. Any Lyle album deserves an automatic three stars; however, unless you are the most diehard of Lyle fans, you can skip this one."
4,Darn-Near Great,"Lyle Lovitt's new CD can't miss. The formula is perfect and so are the choices of ""side""men who play on it. Take a bunch of very popular hit songs from movies, get talent to play on it with you, and presto! The only problem is how many Willie Nelson copycats does the world need? It's OK for Willie to cover famous tunes. But c'mon Lyle. You're a helluva songsmith so let's be orignial.Solo compliant registered, I'm a sucker for anything Randy Newman does, so having him perform on the superb Disney Toy Story guarantees I'll vote heavy. Keb Mo, too, is a strong addition on ""Sun Shines."" These aren't the only worthy tunes. Overall the song selection and performances are strong.Definitely worth having."
5,I never get tired of listing to Cosmo.,"I am totally in awe of Cosmo and this album. Anybody who likes reggae at all must have ""Fire This Time."" I believe it will become to be known as the best of the best. Every single track is first rate and you can tell that Cosmo has put his heart into them."
5,"""The Phantom Strikes."" Great Score.","David Newman's score for the summer blockbuster ""The Phantom"" is very good. Great movie as well. My favourite tracks are: ""The Phantom Strikes"" & ""Must Be The Humidity"" Great action cues on the other tracks too. If only the film hadn't been cut, there would have been much more movie (and score) for us Phantom fans to enjoy. (I know that several scenes between The Phantom and Diana were cut because the director wanted the film to be more ""Fast paced,"" including a scene where The Phantom's horse rears up in the sunset and a scene where The Phantom wrestles an animal were deleted from the film). If you love (or hate) the movie, you'll love the soundtrack. SLAM EVIL!!!"
3,Advanced Harmony Workbook Ottman 5th edition,The book took a little time arriving and has had a page or two missing from it. However there was minimal markings.
3,stereo/mono or rerecorded,"I'm confused. I have various configurations of this. LP, compact 33 double, CD and surround CD. If these were recorded in the early 1950's, then 2- track must have been in its infancy and no way could this be surround. Therefore, these must be rerecordings."
3,"Informative in some areas, others present wrong information",The authors do a wonderful service in collecting and combining a wide body of literature into a readable book. This is a large and tedious job and the authors do a fairly decent job. One area that is particularly off-base is the chemical communication chapter. The authors cite very little literature that is newer than 1988 and base their whole chapter on erroneous theories. I have told all of my students to throw this chapter away.
3,"Lacks the length of first one, and not much improvement","I own and still enjoy playing the first Hitman on PS2. Contracts is not much of an improvement. In fact I like the controlls more on the first one. The game is a good sequel but not great. Rent before buying, and if you like the first one then definitely rent it."
5,The power of the Hit!,"Rented this game a couple of days ago, had never played any of the Hitman games before. As a big fan of shooter games, I love the way this game draws you into the story and the action. Graphics are topnotch for the PS2. Did I forget to mention I bought the game."
1,I have seen better acting from high school students,This movie awful. The acting was the worst I have seen in years. The story did not go anywhere till 45 min into the story. Than I got lost board and well the fastforward button was a great tool to finish this movie
1,"""Bad"" May Not Be the Correct Adjective for this Movie","This movie was boring, uneventful, and disappointing. It had so much potential. Imagine owning an exotic car and only driving it to the supermarket....great potential, but boring.This movie has more dialogue than ""Pride and Prejudice."" Although ""Pride and Prejudice"" has more action than this movie.Great cure for insomnia and will not cause nightmares."
3,pretty good,this Album was a Welcome Return for Rickie Lee Jones.I dig the Arrangements&Her Voice still has the same feel&vibe as it did back in the day.I enjoy the MusicianShip that balances out Her Range.this is a Decent set.
1,Evening of Rickie's Worst Day,"I purchased this CD without hearing it since I am such a big RLJ fan. In my opinion, this CD is a perfect example of why no one wants to pay retail for CD's anymore. If I had only listened to this CD first, I would have spent the money on a sleeve of golf balls instead. If anyone wants to buy this from me at a discount, it's available. Heck, I might even pay you to take it off my hands."
1,Claudine Longet,"I usually love Rickie Lee Jones, but I am going to swim against the tide and say this is her worse album in a long time. All but a couple of cuts on it sound for all the world to me like Claudine Longet. Too much arranging and not enough Rickie Lee for my taste."
2,What are these reviewers thinking?,"I bought this after listening to the hype on my local college radio station. Now I know why they only played Second Chance. If you are expecting an RLJ comeback here, you will be sorely disappointed. There is no comparison to Rickie Lee Jones or Flying Cowboys. To an RLJ fan, this is truly a disappointment."
2,work gloves,Gloves were too stiff to be used in any type of work environment requiring manual dexterity. The Carhart work gloves were a better product for our use.
1,Puzzling,"I find this puzzling. The title smacks of inaccuracy. Clay Aiken'stalent and hard work, his charisma, charm, sharp wit and intelligencemade him a star. Not fans. As I tell students, look at the source. Isit a known source? A source of authority? Do you know the publisher?When choosing a book, you need to choose based on more than the pictureon the cover.This one would not be high on my recommendation list."
1,"Boring, very stupid album","These guys are just stupid. Too much Satanism, less musicianship. When I heard some of their songs, i was disappointed. It was just a waste of money to produce an album, trying to sound Nordic, but they absolutely can't. These Belgian band needs to practice more. Just cut the hype, you guys."
3,Am I Thick?,"In most ways I agree with the other reviews in that this is a 'good first book' on playing chess. However, it still eludes me!!! Perhaps I haven't the patience, or require medication to relax sufficiently to absorb a game in progress, but I truly had difficulty applying all but the most elementary aspects of the book to my game.I admit I'm a 'newbie' in the strictest form, yet a university honors graduate and so felt I should be able to up my game significantly after reading this book. Alas, such was not the case. Is there a 'chess for dummies'? Although I loathe those books, reading this one has convinced me that perhaps I'm in over my head (and I know this was NOT the author's intention).Either I need a pop-up book level starter on chess, or this one didn't do it's job. Still, I learned a great deal, so for that I thank Mr. Robertie."
5,The Man From Snowy River,"This has romance, horse chases, and Australia. What more do you need for an entertaining movie. It's also a good, family movie. I have watched it many times as well as the sequel, Return to Snowy River."
5,Movie Review,"""The Man from Snowy River"" is as good, if not better than its sequel ""Return to Snowy River."" Both movies are set in the Australian Outback and both are beautifully shot and tell a wonderful story. I bought both of these movies for my Dad for Christmas and he loved them! Once again, these movies are hard to come by and it was great that Amazon had them available."
5,Incredible,"We had the VHS version of this movie and it stopped working. So, we ordered the DVD....this is such an incredible movie. We have watched at least 10 times in the last few years. Don't miss it!"
3,The Man From Snowy River,I love the movie but the sound quality was very poor. We had the volume up as far as it would go and still could hardly hear it.
4,Just a great movie,"This is one of my wife's favorite movies. There are a couple instances of mild language, a little drunkenness and a little violence. Some of the music is a bit anachronistic. But, those things are easy to overlook because the movie is so enjoyable."
4,Worth the sticker price (but,"This collection features 11 love songs by a truly gifted adult contemporary singer/song-writer. Some of the songs are re-makes of old Chicago tunes (""If You Leave Me Now"", ""You're The Inspiration""), some are duets with famous female pop stars (""Next Time I Fall"" with Amy Grant, ""After All"" with Cher), and two are new releases (""She Doesn't Need Me"", ""Do You Love Me That Much""). However, this is not my favourite Cetera collection since it is missing some of his biggest hits and only contains ballads; yet it's a worthy buy nonetheless. His ""Greatest Hits"" collection is a much better mix of slow and up-beat songs, and is worth purchasing if only for the pleasure of hearing that ballad-to-end-all-ballads, ""Glory Of Love""."
5,Youre only old once,This will be a gift for my brothers 60th birthday. We raised our kids and are raising our grands on the Dr. Seus!
2,Stone me now.,"This film calls itself ""epic"" and ""outrageous"". Bad choice of words. I'd go with disappointing and eh. It's not horrible, it just doesn't come close to living up to the cast. Of course I'd guess this movie was made just before this group became who they did.It would be a decent watch if you're a major Luke Wilson fan, or Alicia Witt. Jack Black is only in it for maybe 10-15 minutes. The ending was also anticlimactic despite what it said it would be. Still, a decent way to kill 96 minutes with a buzz on I guess."
1,Really dis appointing,"The host is delightful but the content is extremely thin. I have been to Ireland 5 times, for a total of perhaps 60 days, and I wanted a DVD to show my son, with whom I am traveling to Ireland this summer. I couldn't believe how little substance there is in this DVD. It was raining in Kerry, OK, lots of jokes about the weather but what about Kilarney, the Ring of Kerry, Dingle peninsula? It made me wonder if the previous reviews were written by friends of the presenter.This is more like a home movie with a charming but egotistical host. There was more focus on the host than the country, really, what a waste."
4,Good produced tracks,"I am a big fan of King Britt. I consider him one of the best house dj's out there next to people like Feelgood and DJ Dan. This CD has wonderfully produced tracks, and a lof of them are jazz and sould tracks. Very soothing, a definite come down cd. But this cd is not a mixed cd, and I have been looking for a King Britt CD that is mixed. I was dissapointed that this CD was not mixed, but still it has some excellent produced tracks."
4,Listen : you act in the movie !,"That's what I feel when I hear this CD... It's incredible, like it was written, you see the movie only with this CD in your player. The atmosphere is in it, the action is in it, John Travolta and Christian Slater are in it... Try it!"
5,A Soundtrack Lover's Favorite,"Broken Arrow was okay as far as movies go, but its score is beautiful. If you like action movie scores this is definitely a good buy. Hans Zimmer is one of the great score composer of our time and this is Zimmer at his best."
4,What Soul Is All About,"This cd is from Denise's mid to late 70's middle period. A talented songwriter and producer as well as heartfelt vocalist she penned 15 of the 17 tracks here. Most of them tell a story such as 'You oughta thank me' where she is telling another woman how she taught her husband everything 'a man should know'. There's country soul pain in 'Sit down and hurt' and dramatic southern soul in 'Too little in common to be lovers'. The sound is from real musicians so if you're tired of the computerised predictability of what passes for R'n'B today, do yourself a favour and pick this up.Denise is still recording and issued a superb cd 'This Real Woman' last year also available from Amazon. This lady has it all."
4,Don't underrate her nice disco tunes,"I admit her voice is highly suitable for soul ballads, but my quibble is that as her disco tunes such as ''Move Your Body'' and ''P.A.R.T.Y.'' during the same ABC & MCA years are also nice, I think they should have been included, too. This cd's line-up consists only of her slow tunes, which is a little boring."
5,greatest invention in the world,I love these things. they saved me so much money when my Maternity bras got too tight. I can't believe I went so long with a tight bra when these are so cheap! Its a great way to extend the life of your bra for a temporary weight gain
2,More Info please,"The product should have had more information as to the width of the item, it is indeed a 3 hook bra extender however it was way to wide for my bra. This could have been avoided with a more detailed discription."
5,Great Magnet,Very strong I was able have one magnet contact another magnet through a half inch piece of plywood and hold.
3,Guitar Review,"This was a great value and my nephew loved it, but they could not tighten one of the strings because the knob was broken. Fortunately the sellers would give a discount for an upgrade, which my sister is going to do so they can get a better guitar."
5,fuckin great,just pure greatness i thought there first was good but this just blew me away how dez screams out the vocals so good i cant wait for the next album i think it will be even better then this one
4,NOT METALCORE,"A lot of people are trying to call DevilDriver a metalcore band. Well, they're not. Metalcore is a mix of heavy metal (ie: Slipknot, Mudvayne, American Head Charge) and hardcore (ie: As I Lay Dying, Darkest Hour). DevilDriver is heavy metal. Their guitars thrash, grind, and explode. Their drums pulse, pound, and destroy. The vocals are snarly and growl. This my friends, is metal, not metalcore.Now, as fat as the cd goes, its amazing. I wouldn't put it among my favorites, (Ashes of the Wake~ Lamb of God/ L.D. 50~ Mudvayne/ The Feeding~ American Head Charge/ IOWA~ Slipknot) but it is still an amazing cd. It is much more polished than their self-titled debut. Which it makes it better by nature, although i enjoyed their debut for its rawness. However, the polished nature of this cd doesn't detract from its agressivness. Its still as ragful and angry as any other metal cd. This is a great album and a definite plus for DevilDriver."
3,"""the garden's too large to chase down a chicken""","I am always somewhat perplexed by translated volumes of anything and yet I have to rely on tranlations all of the time. It's always heartening, especially in poetry, to see the original language on the facing page. Since I don't read Vietnamese I have no idea if John Balaban has done a worthy job on the poetry of Ho Xuan Huong or not. Two of the Vietnamese reviewers posting seem to think not. I read this volume the first timeoutside on a windy day in autumn and found the verse quite charming. When I re-read it again this winter I didn't enjoy it quite so much. There are many lines and passages that are very beautiful but as a whole I find the poetry somewhat flat. I did enjoy becoming acquainted with a Vietnamese woman poet and appreciated Mr. Balaban's ""Endnotes"" at the back of the book."
2,disappointing book,"As a bilingual native of Vietnam, I was very interested in reading this translation. Unfortunately, it turned out to be quite disappointing. Although the poems are nice, they have little relation to the actual Vietnamese. The translators appear to have simply translated the poems literally word for word, perhaps using a dictionary, without understanding any of the idioms upon which they were based.Nice poems but they are more the poetry of John Balaban than Ho Xuan Huong."
3,Product Great BUT Shipping Ridiculous,"Product itself was fine and works great - but two issues. First, each unit is actually 2 pieces not 1 - but it doesn't say this anywhere. So I ordered 6 because I needed locks for 6 switches, when I could have ordered 3 and saved a few bucks if properly described. Second, I paid $7.88 in shipping... for delivery in an envelope with two 45 cent stamps & a 17 cent stamp... ridiculous..."
3,Peter,"Good product. Does what it is designed and sold to do. The issue I have is that the clip is listed as a single item for the price. When my order arrived, I had 10 extra clips because they are packaged and sold in pairs. I could have bought half of what I ordered. The shipping was expensive as well, so I wasn't about to do a return for those I didn't use. Seller should represent what is being sold more honestly. Hopefully others will read this so they order the correct amount. The clips do work well and I do recommend them."
3,Not good with an air popper.,"This popcorn is not good with an air popper, because the kernels are too light."
1,Horrible Product,This is supposed to be tender popcorn and it is anything but that and the seller will not respond to my emails requesting a refund. I am very sorry I ordered this product.
2,beware of this pop corn,THESE CORN KERNELS ARE VERY VERY SMALL AND WHEN POPPED WILL RESULT IN SMALL POPPED CORN WHICH IS NOT GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND WILL NOT POP IN A HOT AIR POPPER
3,Great beats. Inane lyrics.,"There's a lot to like on the techno-side of this album, but if you're looking for meaning, this isn't it. I've had to stop listening to some of the tracks because the lyrics are just too contrived and unconvincing, but I'm sure that if I didn't know English it would be one of my favorite albums."
5,Bengali grammar with ENGLISH TRANSLITERATION!!!,"This book is great as it includes Bengali and transliteration into roman characters as well as English translation throughout. Most books on Bengali, do not include ANY transliteration, nor any lessons on learning the alphabet. If you want to start learning Bengali seriously I suggest this book. There are a few others out there too. Check my other reviews if you are interested in reading what I think of those books too. Thanks! :)"
5,super fast shipping..... required summer reading for my sixth grader without going to the store,This was on my sons required summer reading list.......It came very quickly and a great price.......in time for us to take away on vacation so that he had it with him (he wasn't happy about this - but I was)......
5,The Right Book for The Times,"As business learns the limits of the I-focused executive, this book provides the kind of perspective and guidance we all need to help leaders build creative, energized and effectives teams. I recommend this book for every executive who wants to take their organization to the next level of performance."
1,Nothing to write home about,"I would give this book negative stars if I could. Mundane writing at best about an 80s band. Echo did not exactly set the world on fire, but they deserve a more skilled and experienced writer to explore their history. After I finished reading the book, my response was, ""Ok, so what?"" Easily forgettable."
4,Excellent Book to Learn How to Handle Tough Times,"I found this book to be a good outline for handling a crisis. It gets slow sometimes in describing the events the author was involved in but overall the message and points are sound. I struggled a little since he is a Clintonite, having served with Slick Willie and he talks and teaches of integrity while at the same time loving Bubba ... but that doesnt take away from the job hes done at FEMA or the lessons he is passing along. Good book."
4,Fans of KT Tunstall,"Although I haven't warmed up to this album as quickly as I did to ""Eye to the Telescope"", KT Tunstall is ""Drastically Fantastic"" just the same. I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of KT Tunstall."
3,"Enjoyable, but too self-referential","I enjoyed reading this book, but I thought it was too reliant on the author's experience of motherhood. The research referred to comprised a small part of the text. I would have enjoyed it more had it been a) more honsestly about one woman's experiences or b) better researched and more objective. All in all, I preferred Operating Instructions which was more like a), and The Mother Dance which was a bit more like b)."
2,Too stiff for training,"Although this would make a good toy knife, it is too light, stiff, and pointy for safe training. We were looking for a good knife to practice knife defense in Krav Maga, but on receiving these we were pretty disappointed. The checkering on the grip is nice, but the finger separator would get in the way while doing dis-arms. The knife feels more like a plastic than rubber, and has a rather sharp point for a training knife. It hardly takes any power to cause quite a bit of pain to the recipient, and so the attacker finds himself holding back quite a bit of power and speed.Our instructor uses the Applegate Fairbairn Rubber Training Knives, Black, Pair, and it is REAL rubber, not some weird rubber/plastic. It also has quite a nice heft to it, compared to this knife."
2,"Very nice, but the belt clip will break easily.","This case was very nice- for about two weeks. I wore it on my belt, but when I was in the grocery store, I bumped up against a post. Instead of feeling resistance on the case/clip,the clip snapped in half and the case went flying. I've had cheaper plastic belt holsters last longer and take more abuse- this was pathetic. I'm glad I only paid $10 for this, but now I'll have to buy something else. What a shame."
1,Does not look like the picture,I ordered this product from BargainCell and it's a completely different product than what the picture shows. It's bulkier and uglier and does not mention anything about having a swivel belt clip on the back (which I didn't want or need).
1,Not for SGH-D900,"This is not for the Samsung SGH-D900 as mentioned, it's to big, there's sufficient space for 2 cel phones, the D900 thickness, is less than the space in the case."
4,"Great book, but...","This book was very informative about the potential dangers of GM foods, and why we need more testing before we release these organism into the environment unchecked. As the author states, there is no way to recall GMO's. I found it somewhat difficult to read the book with all the typing and grammar errors. This book would have been more credible had the author spent more time editting. Overall, I recommend would definitely recommend it."
3,"Ok, but...",Too heavy for backpacking. Hard to use inside a pack. We use it stand alone as a summer sleep bag over a deep padding like your existing backpack.
2,Disappointedly Short Glimpse,"The US is a big beautiful country of varying natural sightseeing in any destination imaginable as architecture and colourfulness of a human creativity.New York City and San Francisco are two cities I recommend everyone to definitely visit in the USA, and this video-guide has evoked my personal memories with disappointedly short glimpse at SF hardly convincible for tourists investing substantial funds in a trance-continental journey especially."
3,Rape is not romantic,"This book would have been 4 stars if not for the rape scene. She told him ""no"", she fought him and tried to escape him. No means no and he raped the woman he supposedly loved. That doesn't speak well for the hero's character. Thanks to other reviewers, I was aware of the problem with this book so I just skimmed over that part. I wanted to read it because I'd read Ian's and Hadden's stories before and I wanted to get more of their backgrounds. I did get new insights into their characters from this book."
1,A Well Pleasured Lady,"I was very disappointed in this book. The plot and the character development was weak. You didn't really care what happened to the characters. Sexual tension, though present, was not very tense! Not worth your time."
3,Not my favorite.....,"""A Well Pleasured Lady"" was certainly not a bad read, however it wasnt really all that wonderful either. I didnt really feel that I connected all that well with the characters..its not that they were poorly written, but that I just didnt like them. I found myself to be far more interested in Mary's brother and her cousin Ian. I also wasnt too thrilled with Mary and Sebastian's first love scene..I dont normally have a problem with a ""Forced Seduction""..but this crossed the line a bit..not very sexy..One more thing bothered me..I know this may sound silly, but it annoyed me immensely that Mary is described as having blonde hair, but on the cover's step back she is portrayed as having this wildly long red hair..not a big deal I realize..but it bothered me nonetheless...Whoever chooses the cover for the book should at least know what the characters look like!! All in all not too great..if you must read it I suggest borrowing someone elses..or a UBS."
1,Less than one star,"It has been a long time since I have picked up a book and couldn't bear to turn the pages or even peek at the ending. Well, this was it. I keep trying to finish this because I read the other reviews and thought it has to get better. Mary Guinevere Fairchild isn't a heroine that I cared about. This story has nothing to recommend it."
4,Good read.,"I have a few of her books in paper back and hard cover. I enjoy reading her books, this particular book is an easy read."
5,Owen the story of a baby,Owen still had a blanket even though he was old enough togive it away. Owen carried it everywere went. His parentstold him he had to give it away. So he stuffed it in hispajama pants. The problem was school was coming up andhe couldn't bring his blanket to school. I really likedthe book and I think you should read it.
5,Lovely clever story,"My six year old son still sleeps with his beloved ""white blankie"" and he loves it with all his heart, just like Owen! He can really relate to this story. The illustrations are beautiful and bursting with colour. It is a pleasure to read! Any child who is attached to a special blankie or cuddle toy will like this story. I highly recommend it!"
4,Blanketed Owen,Owen is a marvolous book that made me wander what next. I likehis books because of how well Kevin Hankes illastrates and writes his books. Owen will not give up his blanket until...Readand find out more amazing facts about Owen.
5,Very Informative!,Nicely put together!!! It also helps that it's in color and not your typical black and white boring documentary like a lot of films focusing on this time period are. It also does an excellent job following a handful of different type of soldiers from the draftee to the enlistee.
5,Great book!,"Skills and Powers lets you expand your Dungeons and Dragons character as far as your imagination will let you. It lets you customize your character just the way you want it. It gives new rules, better equipment lists, and many new races for you to base a character on. All in all, a great book!"
4,It has the basics,"I agree with some of the criticism that this book is aimed at professionals with a relatively high income, no money management skills, and a high amount of credit debt.However, I do think that it has some great basic information about paying bills, transferring credit card balances, understanding and improving your credit score, and creating a monthly budget. These are tips anyone can use.I consider myself to be pretty fiscally responsible, but I picked up some good organizational tips and some interesting facts about transferring debts. The book is a quick read and written in a conversational tone.Oh, and I did get the book from the library. I suggest borrowing it or buying it at a reduced cost, reading the chapters that pertain to your situation, and taking a few notes. No need to own this one."
2,Not impressed!,I have to agree with the very first poster. There wasn't anything here particularly insightful to me. If I had an extra $10 a day I wouldn't be in debt. I've already done the suggestions on cutting back years ago so this wasn't helpful. I found Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover much more helful and doable.
3,Informative but..,"I have been reading a lot of books on debt management lately. After my divorce and foreclosure I found myself with over 100,000 in debt. I have been slowly climbing out of the hole that I've dug for myself. Jean Chatsky's book offers excellent savings strategies, but not for the purpose of significantly reducing debt quickly. If you have a ton of debt like me, you may prefer books like Zero Debt by Lynnette Khalfani or even Credit after Bankruptcy by Stephen Snyder. Both were very useful and informative and contain more personal strategies from the authors who have actually walked in debt laden shoes like my own."
5,It is easy to reduce my debt,"This book gave me valuable advice on how to reduce my debt. Chatzky helped me get a grasp on how damaging my excess debt really is and she gave me lots of tips for improvement. Surprisingly, most of them were very easy and would not cause much hardship. I especially like her easy, friendly writing style. I found this book to be extremely useful and have implemented some of her ideas already. This would be a perfect present for any high school/college aged kid starting to manage their finances."
4,"Very basic, but there is some good information in it","So many negative reviews of this book are based on what the reviewer thinks everyone already knows - however it is they know that. True, this is not an in-depth economic or financial text, but it isn't meant to be. I consider myself an educated, relatively organized professional with workable financial knowledge, but I still picked up a few good tips from this book, and it made me think about a couple topics in a new light. My husband and I did the short exercises and discovered a surprise or two about our spending - nothing that was breaking the bank, but correcting the issues will save us some money that will add up over time.This book is a very quick read done in a friendly, conversational tone. If you get it from your local library as we did, reading it won't cost anything, won't be much of a time investment, certainly won't hurt anything, and who knows, you may end up learning a thing or two that'll save you a few bucks."
1,What income bracket is she in?,"$10 a Day! What Income Bracket does this woman live in? That is around $300 a month, and a lot of the people that I know that need help work very hard to take that much home a week. Perhaps she should spend some time learning how the other half lives. I know people who went into debt so their kids could see a doctor, and have to decide between medicine and food every day.I guess they should categorize these books acording to income bracket."
4,"Right from the Start: Create a Sane, Soft, Well-Balanced Horse","I truly love the concept of starting the horse from the ground but it is not as easy as it looks. The book was very well illustrated and clear. I do think the groundwork lessons should have been in Chapter 1 and progressed from there. As it is written, the groundwork is toward the end of the book which is confusing for a novice like me. I need step-by-step guidance. I still highly recommend this book, especially for the groundwork section."
3,3 stars is a little more than fair!!!,"This book has some great tips, but also has a lot of techniques I do not agree with. Such as sesawing the horses mouth and pulling with both arms on a horses mouth to make them stop or ""give to the reins"". To ride a horse properly and SOFTLY, one should hold the reins tightly between the thumb and forefinger (so they do not slip out of your hands) and leave the rest of your hand relaxed and open so you can squeeze your fingers around the reins, as you would squeeze water out of a sponge, RATHER than Pulling back against the horse, who will only pull against you and become stiff. That was just one of my MAIN objections to this book. The book Enlightened Equitation by Heather Moffett explains the effects of soft and receptive hands a lot more thoroughly than I can in the blurb."
5,Just what I was looking for.,This is just what I wanted to upgrade my Toshiba M15 S405.It works flawlessly.
4,This is great fun,"This is a fun pan to have. A recipe for the usual cake makes about 16 twinkies. I didn't bother with the decorator, but used a freezer bag with the coupler and a 1/4 inch round tip to fill the twinkies. Serving twinkies that taste good, and are the shape of the old standby is just fun for all ages. Plus, you can freeze the ones you don't want right now, serve them later, and it doesn't look like part of a cake. The favorite is red velvet cake with the cooked red velvet icing, but you only need half a recipe of icing for a 2 layer cake."
2,Recipes?,"They expect you to make regular cake with filling. I'm not sure how useful the optional recipe book is, but I'd suggest trying it, unless you want a glorified cupcake tray."
5,Fastest home language learning,"I have tried a wide variety of self teaching programs for multiple languages, such as the ""Teach Yourself"" series, ""For Dummies"", Living Language, Instant Immersion, and Rosetta Stone as well as college classes. While all these systems are quite well implemented, Pimsleur has time and again been the fastest path to functional proficiency.It's convenient in being pure audio because you can use it while commuting or performing other tasks.The program purposely does not get into depth teaching grammar or large vocabulary. You are expected to pick these up by inference and context. This lets you learn faster, and without an incorrect accent. The downside is that your education will not be as thorough. I highly recommend using Pimsleur to get 'up and running' in the language and then augmenting with a text that specifically addresses grammar or formal education.The Greek program has made it quite easy for me to settle into living here in Crete."
3,cell phone products,Although this is a good product it causes me problems . My fingers are to big for the keyboard and I end up with things I wasn't expecting. Most ladies could probably love this phone becouse of the finger nails and graceful hands. However for a man the keyboard is very hard to use.

3,"Love the bottles, the cup not so much.","I love the bottles (except the extra parts to wash) so I had high expectations for the cups. My biggest gripe is that they are slightly leaky, therefore the three star rating. You buy sippy cups because they aren't supposed to leak, and although it leaks only a little, it's a nuisance. Other than that, the cups are great. Handles always line up with spout (unlike many other cups) and my child drinks well from them. If a large amount of liquid is used, they seal better, but for small quantities, use something else."
2,Not a fan,This cup leaked after one time in the dishwasher on the top rack. Costs alot for not being leak proof.
1,Don't buy if your child has any teeth!,"This sippy cup, in theory, is good. However, if your child has any teeth - even one - they will quickly pierce the softy part that they suck on, releasing a flow of whatever liquid contents were contained down their shirt. At that point, the cup is garbage bound because there is no possible way to fix it. Dr. Browns does a good job with bottles, but hasn't figured out the next step quite yet."
3,Friendship!,This is a great book if you watched the Odd couple and loved it like I did. You will really enjoy the story of friendship. It made me laugh and cry and I read it all in an hour and a half!
3,What happened Motorola?,"Picked up this phone when it was time to upgrade from my first Razr. What a disappointment! It's heavier and chunkier than my nice, slim, lightweight one. It has a recurring problem with an echo that my carrier assures me is 'my phone not their equipment' and the battery life is poor, even though I almost exclusively use it just as a phone and don't use the camera/video/MP3 features at all. I should have kept using my old phone! I was very disappointed in the product and it may result in not purchasing a Motorola again. I wouldn't recommend it if you're accustomed to the old Razr and are expecting similar quality. On the the plus size it is durable, easier to find(due to it's increased size) and if I were planning on using the MP3 capabilities would be fine. The wallpaper etc that come with it were disappointing as were the ring tones, but this is easily changed. I wouldn't buy another one, but it may meet your requirements if they're different than mine."
1,disappointed,"Not what I was looking for, small print and not easy shortcuts. I know how to do the math the long method. I was looking for things you can do in your head for a rough estimate."
4,"Absolutely Fabulous, but could be better","Every fan of Python should own a copy, espesially if you are musically literate. I much enjoy sitting at the piano and singing to the songs as I play along. All of the lyrics are published for every song. The only flaw is that in a misguided attempt to be funny (which I can understand) not all of the music is legible. However it does not detract from the over all hilairity of the book. A must-have."
1,One of the Great Con Jobs,"I bought this for a laugh. I thought it was a feature. It was positively reviewed.It turned out to be only 90 seconds (or so) long, and looked like it had been shot withan early cell phone camera. It wasn't even a good or funny fart. I guess the joke was on me."
3,where's the *&^%$ * surf music???,"to sum it up! a mediocre soundtrack for a mediocre movie. WTF was milan thinking when they omitted one of the coolest songs from escape from la. which is the theme of snake surfing in pursuit of eddie. (played by steve buscemei)as for shirley walker, sweetheart stick to doing what you do best and that's scoring BATMAN cartoons. even the final clash between snake and cuervo jones sounded like it came from the aforemention animated series. (sigh)oh well, i guess i'll pass this one up."
3,The chocolate is yummy but....,"The chocolate is very good and it is interesting to try candy from other countries. The Choco Babies are really good and so was the coffee flavored chocolate. The round multi colored candies look like m&ms but, I could actually taste a little fruit flavor with each one. You might be wondering why I gave this a lower rating than I normally give and as far as I know at this time less stars than the other people. This is because when they say mini the mean mini! Each box is about two inches tall and wide and I payed over 5 dollars plus shipping! Because of that I found this item to be a little bit of a rip off. I wanted to make people aware of the size because I didn't know the samples would be so small. Maybe it was a failure on my part for not finding out more before buying this."
3,Very interesting,Shipping was fast and company is great. Product met expectations although I will say that it is an ACQUIRED taste so this product is not for everyone. Make sure you find a recipe that will work with this.
2,Still makes your nails chip and break,"I bought this because it did not include formaldehyde, etc. Still made my nails chip and peel. Threw it away."
2,Smitten,"Buffulo Tom's move away from inspired, driving pop-punk rock to a more mature, straight-forward pop sound is a bit of a disappointment for me. It's good to add other instruments to create new textures to their music, because you can't keep doing the same thing over and over, but they sacraficed too much of their harder edge and created a softer, more bland sound. None of these songs are horrible, but they don't do anything for me either. It's pleasant background music, nothing more."
4,AND THE BEAT GOES ON in this album by Sonny & CherI,"This is Sonny & Cher's Third Album, and thier weakest of the three they recorded for Atco Records. The highlight of the album is the classic song ""THE BEAT GOES ON"". Another interesting song is ""Little Man"" with its Gyspy rythmn was a bigger hit song in England than ""The Beat Goes on"" was in 1966. Still a very good album from the grooviest couple of the sixties !"
4,review,"item was as described, the only problem was the case was cracked when it arrived. otherwise, no other concerns. CD works just fine. shipping was fast."
4,wow forgot how good they were,their hits never sounded better digitally remastered. it was impossible not to hear THREE DOG NIGHT on the am fm radio during the late 60 s to the mid 70 s. the most complete greatest hits ener put on a single disk.
5,What movie did your reviewer see?,"After reading your reviewer's summary of the movie Lloyd, I'm thinking she might have been watching two things at once. Her review of this often funny and, also, touching movie bears no resemblence to the film I enjoyed. This is a wonderful film for anyone who has ever been an outsider. We may not have all triumphed in the end as Lloyd does, but he reminds us all that it's possible. Lloyd is a great role model of perseverance-- and of overcoming unhappy circumstances with creativity and humor. Ignore the ""official"" review and buy this for your family. (And talk about it with your kids, too.)"
3,Just Ok,"This blender is just ok. If you're making milkshakes or smoothies (minus ice) it works fine. Forget making any drink with crushed ice like a dacquiri or slushy. The ice ends up as 1/2"" chunks. After suffering with this blender for a year, I just bought a KitchenAid Ultra Power. It is great!"
5,"Incredible, a must-read!","I read this book as fast as my eyes and fingers would allow me! Zahn delivers an exciting and fast-paced story with the characters we've all grown to know and love and adds some new ones. The beginning may be a little slow to some, but stick with it and I can guarantee you'll not be disappointed!"
3,"Wow, I remember this being much better","This book really annoyed me actually. I read it originally when I was a teenager and had such fond memories of it. I probably should have left it that way. But with the news of J.J. Abrams doing Episode VII and hearing that they would not be basing them on this series I figured I'd read them again.Seriously, if Grand Admiral Thrawn is such a genius why does he have such a moronic captain around him 24/7. It just got so old reading about Thrawn figuring out what the Republic is doing and then every single time having Captain Pellaeon, like the idiot he is, second guess Thrawn's orders. ""Huh, but why would I do that Grand Admial?"", ""What do you mean Luke Skywalker is aboard the ship!!??"" Just got comically stupid after a while.Still, if you are a Star Wars fan you have to at least read this series once. Hopefully you did it when you were young."
5,One of the Best Star Wars Stories Ever,"Like my reviews on the other two books in this series, I have to say again that Timothy Zahn is a master of story telling and clearly brings the Star Wars universe back to life after the end of the last movie. The finding of the lost fleet and the carnage aboard the ships and so much is still so vivid in my head all these years later. I read this book originally the weekend it came out and finished it the same day. I hardly ever can go back and read books more than once but this story is just that good. I would love to see this story on the big screen. This trilogy was what got me into reading and I would suggest it to anyone that would love a great fantasy or sci-fi story. Outstanding job!"
4,Trilogy is getting better with this second book.,"I liked this second book more than the first, especially the Mara Jade character. By the end I was hooked (for the third book) to see what becomes of Mara Jade. Zahn seems to take his time telling stories, and if it were shorter (and just a tad bit better) it'd be 5 stars."
1,the worst album of the year!!!!!!!,It is sad to see max trying to sell out. I miss the old Sepultura stuff. thank God the best band in the world NEVERMORE'S new album is coming out soon.
1,WOW!!!!,"I am the only person to write this, yall better follow along. I had to read this book for school. This book is not all that good cus it has all these different stories n i dont think that others should read this book unless u want to get confused or sumhin. But i wanna giv a shout out... I <3 eric!!!HI MOMMY!!!!!!!!!! '04"
1,Low quality,I looked for these tools in all my local tool suppliers and everyone either did not carried it or was out of stock. Purchased from here and received the tools promptly. As soon as I started using the 8mm it stripped. Not even three bolts into it. I call immediately and the crew at Amazon and the supplier were great enough to point me in the right direction return the tool for a refund.
5,FANTASTIC,"LOVE this movie. Lucille Ball and Bea Arthur were great. I had this movie on video tape, and it has finally been released on DVD. It is a great feel good movie/musical."
1,I Love Lucy & this is one of the worst movies ever,"Lucille Ball was one of the greatest comedians of all time and I have every I Love Lucy possible on VHS or DVD. But she was in over her head on this one.It seemed like an act of arrogance for her to take on a singing role when she couldn't sing, she was supposed to be in her twenties but was 62 and she gives a leaden, unfunny performance. Even her physical comedy falls flat in this BOMB! It's not even ""funny bad"", it should be avoided at all costs."
1,A DRAG SHOW SET IN A DOG POUND,I MAY LOVE LUCY BUT AFTER THIS TRAVESTY SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN A SWIFT KICK IN THE FANNY FOR A VANITY PRODUCTION EVEN MORE LURID THAN MAE WEST's SWAN SONG 'SEXTETTE'. AT LEAST MISS WEST KNEW SHE WAS RIDICULOUS BUT LUCY FLINGS HERSELF TO THE WORLD IN THIS ROLE WHERE SHE CROAKS THE MUSICAL NUMBERS AND AS FOR DANCING-SOME PEOPLE HAVE TWO LEFT FEET-SHE SEEMS TO HAVE TWO BROKEN FEET. AND MORE VASELINE THAN USED IN A HOSPITAL BURN WARD IS GOBBED ON THE CAMERA LENS FOR HER CLOSE-UPS. AND TO MAKE LUCY LOOK MORE GLAMAROUS BEA ARTHUR IS DRESSED TO LOOK LIKE A COMBINATION OF SPIDER WOMAN AND LON CHANEY-DON'T BELIEVE ME? WATCH THE BOSOM BUDDIES NUMBER IN THE RESTAURANT. DREADFUL!
3,Not great cinema-but helluava movie,"No-this isn't cinema's finest musical and probably not Lucy's best performance, but some wonderful songs and great one-liners make this worth viewing. Bohemian Mame shares life's banquet and no one should strave to death. Worth viewing."
1,Could Be The Worst Movie Musical Ever,"Lucy is great, but not in this role. I would suggest buying Auntie Mame the orgininal movie with Russel and then listening to the Broadway album with the incredible Angela Lansbury. You would get the Mame experience without having to pull your hair out by the roots in huge clumps."
3,Poor DVD Production,"Much has been said about the choice of Lucille Ball in the role so I won't add to that.However, the great disappointment is that the DVD has been released with sound, not Dolby 5.1, not Dolby Stereo, but so called Dolby mono. I acknowledge that Dolby 5.1 was barely invented when the film was made, but that hasn't stopped the studios from adding a Dolby 5.1 sound track to other early films (eg My Fair Lady). I think the conversion to DVD was sub-standard."
1,The Worst Film Version of a Splendid Stage Musical,"Step aside GYPSY. Forget HELLO, DOLLY! When it comes to a dreadful film version of a terrific stage musical, the bottom of the barrel is Lucille Ball in MAME. I went to the premiere of the film at Radio City Music Hall in New York, and when Lucy took a bow at from a side box after the movie was over, the audience booed and hissed. It virtually killed film musicals till CHICAGO came along decades later. The stage musical had class. The movie is crass."
5,A PVD Essential,"When I first heard of PVD,I thought all he did was make mainstream cheesey dance music.After hearing this awesome collection of his best songs,I immediately changed my mind.Hell,I'd buy this album just to hear ""step right on""...the best PVD song ever!This cd will get you moving on the dancefloor and make you chill out afterwards.The songs flow well together,and in my opinion ""Politics of Dancing""is NOT his best work ...this is(even though it's not an actual mix)Dance lovers,If you want a cd that gives you plenty of motivation and smiles...get this one!"
5,Lots of fun,My son got this for his birthday and he loves it. It keeps him busy and he really enjoys it.
2,disapointed,there were no pictures to look at to aid in decision making process and the description was barely enough to tell what it was. it was basically a big gamble ordering it. even though it was described as being able to fit my pickup it was clearly not what i needed.....in short your AP exhaust products line needs better description and pictures!!!
1,Robust statistics book with a funny title,"The authors offer a lot of useful material. However, they do not offer a bridge between the jargon of signal processing (filters) and robust statistics. It would have been much more useful with that having been done.It is written in the jargon of the robust statistics folks. If you have not read a book on that subject, you probably will be more than a little lost. If you understand signal processing and rubust statistics well, you don't need the book.Their main interest is in 2D processing and when I have to do some image processing, I will look at the book again and perhaps find something redeeming. I find Arce's book on Nonlinear Signal Processing quite a bit more useful in the general case.It is high priced at the used price. It is definitely not worth the full price. A good book on statistical signal processing and a good book on robust statistics cost less and has more value."
3,Gift,I bought this as a gift for Dad. It is a great book. I enjoy reading biographies. No problems with the book.
5,You will not be disapointed.,I was very happy to get this blu ray in the mail. I've been a big fan of STP for most of my life. They still got an amazing stage present. I was blown away. He was all wasted slinking around on stage and even kissed one of the guitar players on the mouth while he was playing. A few times scott looked like he was itchin for some smack. Together this is ther perfect combination for a wonderful concert. This is by far the best STP concert i've seen!!
5,Another entertaining night from WWF!,"This was another classic WWF pay per view. (But what WWF PPVs aren't classic?) Macho Man winning the title is a great moment, plus the Hogan-Andre rematch and the tag title match are must sees."
2,Has anyone ever wondered why PPV's are 3 houres each??,"This is the reason. 4 long, boring hours of bad wrestling. If you want to see Hulk-Andre get Wrestlemania III, which is an awesome show. Their match on that tape is a million times better that this crap. The only reason I did'nt give it * is because the right person won the tournament."
3,When lane markers blur and the wheel is more real than you,"Imagine a stoned, scared steel drum band rescored for guitar layered over itself. It's broken into surprisingly short sections on the CD and I've never decided if this works to or against the material. On the one hand the pieces don't have the chance to build up as much as they might but on the other it dodges the pretentious song-cycle and the sharp disjunctions reset the listener. The cumulative effect is strong as the theme is hit on every track.This is the music of obsession and as such is the perfect match to Ballard's novel and a fair one for the film."
3,Good Halloween costum for Elmo fans,"The costume looks good but is very hot and makes our toddler sweat quite a bit. It looks good, and the quality seems ok."
4,Jazz Romp,"I'm a fan from way back of Miles and Herbie, etc, and this is a somewhat lighter version of the jazz ensemble work we all know and love. It's a little of everything - more jazz than Latin, but at times there are brief passages of metal drum, acoustic guitar and Latin tempo. Very relaxing and an easy listen without the irritating use of synthesizer. Very nice."
5,There Is No Equal,"There music is just to good for me to put my opinion of it into words. Of all their music this CD is their best. From Long Time Gone to Top of the World not a bad or simply ""Ok"" song on the CD.I already owned the CD when I hesitantly bought the bouns DVD limited edition. (Owning two sets of the same music..unheard of my billfold screamed)The purchase of this special edition was worth every penny."
4,England Dan,"Heard this main cut on XM that I hadn't heard in something like 30years and it sounded excellent. Ordered it and was really pleased with not only the songs, but the quality of engineering and the clarity of the recording. Excellent job all the way around."
4,Came in handly,Bought a camper that had a awning attached which was beginning to come apart at the seam. With this product I was able to save hundreds of dollars in replacement costs by sewing the awning seams back together. I even reinforced other seams to extend longevity.
5,Handy tool well worth the price,Purchased as a replacement. The Speedy Stitcher doesn't get daily use but is indispensable when tough stitching tasks arise. Spare needles are a good idea as breaking one is inevitable over time. Very pleased with this purchase.
4,Works well,"I bought this to use for Leather working projects. The instructions are easy to understand and the needle is sharp and durable. It stitches the leather together well, but it will not look as nice as hand stitching. I am also a beginner at leather working and purchasing this gave me something to use until I had a fid or plain awl."
5,Works on jeans too!,"I was working on a job in Richmond, Va. and ripped my new jeans. One of the guys had this exact unit. I don't sew, but I was in a spot. It took him about 2 minutes to explain how it works. It's not the prettiest patch ever done, but fine for construction attire. The jeans are still going strong after 6 months and I am sold on this device. I'll be ordering one for myself today.I am glad that I read the reviews of similar products before buying. I would have expected the competitors to have similar products. Thanks to Amazon reviewers, I now know that they do not. This is definitely the real deal, and I am going for this one. All the better, its made in my favorite country, the good ole US of A.(I am always stunned when I go to the store and see cookies made in China. We need to keep our jobs here! Our stores should be ashamed to even ship cookies in here from China that has some of the dirtiest water on the planet.)"
5,Merry Christmas!!!,"This is just what you would expect from the Boston Pops and John Williams; beautiful and most enjoyable Christmas music. This is the type of music one thinks of when they hear the term ""Christmas music"". All the favorites played in classy style. It's reasonably priced at Amazon."
2,My lotion wasn't full,"I ordered this from outside the U.S.A. When i got it the bottle had a big bump. The bottle wasn't cracked, but at least 10% of the content was missing. I won't be able to return it because it's too expensive to send it back. Had a really bad experience and feeled like i got a used lotion. It feels creepy having an used body lotion. Besides, it is showcased with the parfumes! I tought it was perfume and that is why i bought it."
2,problem,ummm yeah first off this sword did now turn blue when an ork was near so i nearly died and second it broke when i tried to stab said orc i am now dead
2,Voyage......,"I bought this on VHS, watched it on my TV, and thought it was just a little dull. It's not a terrible movie but just too ""on the kid-side"" for entertainment."
3,1 out of 2 isn't so bad is it?,"Order this for a Desktop Repair however after spending a few unnecessary hours trying to troubleshoot software issues, it turns out one of the two sticks of RAM I received was bad. Let us skip ahead and ignore the many hours where I should have known better that all my fault issues in Event Viewer was telling me RAM was my issue. We'll go right down to the RMA claim.I think the RMA claim was handled excellent, at least for me I can say where it cost my business time and delay to a customer, I was refunded my money, and A memory stick replacement was sent. I should rate, this purchase worse, but I really only lost out on some time, and had to explain to a customer we only got Half the job done."
5,perfect for any application,"really improved my pc's performance will be purchasing more soon,nice and easy plug and play.not much more to say though"
1,Bad Product to Purchase,"This product is nothing as i expected. First of all the picture of the product shows that it is boxed, but what actually happened is that i received two separate RAM chips covered in air bags. Second after installing the RAM, my computer began experiencing errors, so i ran a memory test utility that indicated that my new RAM is faulted!!!"
4,Amazing price for a cool knife,"Ok the price took this from a 3 star to a 4 star purchase. I bought this knife to replace mine that I had lost. Overall I think the knife is great, but the trigger makes it hard to use with one hand. Other than that everything about the knife is solid. This is well built and durable."
4,Magnesium Taurate,"Purchased this product, after much research, to help heart palpitations. It had gotten as good or better reviews than the other products I looked at. So far I'm happy with the results. I take two a day and my palpitations have definitely decreased. Not Completely gone, but much, much better! Not as noticeable when I do have them."
1,I have not seen any effect,I am using my second bottle now hoping that it helps cutting my Migraine headaches but I have not seen any effect so far.I read in a book before that this type of Magnesium can help with Migraine. I may give up hope after finishing the second bottle..
1,I wish I could Give This Peice of JUNK 0 stars,Trigger gun connects to hose via thin plastic. I guarantee you will be shopping for a replacement Trigger Gun before long.
2,somewhat disappointing as a larnelle harris product,"While I am not an avid Larnelle Harris fan, I have heard several songs he has sang and used to own two cassette tapes of his with BIG songs on them. This album was disappointing to me. It seemed as if he was trying to take his music in a different direction, and I am not sure it is a direction I find appealing. There are no real memorable songs on this CD. Nothing big. Nothing that made me want to go out and buy the soundtracks and sing them in church like ""Love Found a Way"". Larnelle still has the pipes and I thoroughly enjoy his voice. But the way he chose to display it on this album left me wishing I had not purchased it."
2,Probably should have gotten an indoor,"On my roof on a short mast I just barely get about 12 channels. Unfortunately the boneheads who broadcast here in San Diego put their towers on 3 mountains at 3 different directions from the center of the city so no matter which way you point the antenna you have at least one weak signal or no signal. Worked almost as well propped up in my bedroom. Barely worked in my attic. Go figure. I suspect it's just not a very good antenna. Probably work with a rotor, but for me an indoor would have worked just as well."
2,Channel Master 3010,Channel Master 3010 cannot receive UHF high band stations (channels 7-13)even line of sight and 12 miles from broadcast tower!
4,good antenna,"Shipped was very fast. This antenna does the job quite well. It does have a plastic frame, so I would be a bit leary of mounting it outside, especially in areas of high wind. I have it mounted in my attic and receive nearly full signal strength. Two of the local channels will continue to broadcast in the VHF band, so it was essential to buy VHF/UHF antenna. The transmitters are approximately 10 miles away and the terrain is very hilly."
1,"old people performing for the 100,000th time","if you like soul music and want to see the original performances, steer wide of this doozy.nobody is telling you what this dvd really is.sure, the music is live. sure it features the original artists (mostly). but they are mostly **recent recordings**. this dvd features live concerts recorded in recent years performed by the original artists. if you want to see the ""live"" performance of the piece by the musicians, you sorta get what you want.got this for my wife for christmas and we just basically skipped thru the thing (next, next, next). we went thru it pretty fast, but i don't think there are any old shows mixed in at all.blech. i cannot recommend this to anyone."
3,A solid 3 stars,"Caught me by surprise...this movie kept my attention due to pretty goodacting..good music and a interesting script. I took this movie likea good episode of Outer Limits. The creature effects are decent and someof them are well made. The ending is a little lame, but it leaves the door open for a sequel.... in which i will also get...as this is a interesting story that has lots of room to evolve."
4,heavy grooves,"I wish they had part one of this here as well (even though I already own it). . . Heck - I'd like to see more of these . . .Maybe I just need to hunt down the artists , and buy their albumnsAnd I agree with the reviewer below me - there is no disco here . . I think the first reviewer left his review for the wrong product . . . this cd should not be confused with ""pure funk"" - which is disco .Anyway , there are a few really good tracks here , then there are a few so-so tracks. . .but for the price - I would definitely recommend this to funk and soul fans ."
4,Not bad for something to play at a party,This cd is a mix of good and bad disco. It has all the trendy hot disco songs from the seventys that you love along with all the bubble gum disco. If you are having a party at your house there a definetly songs on this album that will get your groove going an overall good chose from somene that likes a wide variety of music.
2,Same old Horner Re-Hash,"Don't get me wrong, this music is beautiful, Horneresque, but sadly its the same Horner we have heard many times rehashing his old stuff trying to give it a new sound. He really didnt even try on this one. I was hoping for something new and inspired but didn't get it. Loved the movie anyway though."
4,More secrets revealed,"In Lucinda's Secret the Grace kids get to meet their great-aunt Lucinda, who used to live at the Spiderwick estate, and they find out why she is an asylum. Its not hard to guess, but the fun just blasts off from there. This chapter of the Spiderwick Chronicles really ramps up the tension and introduces more fantastic creatures such as a phooka, elves, and little faeries whose food you should avoid. If you've come this far don't miss this third installment of the Spiderwick Chronicles!"
3,The right way to do elves,"My only complaint about this series is they end too quickly; but this is common for early reader-type books, and keeps you interested in what is happening in the next installment. Ms. Black has an innate understanding of fairy tales and knows how to portray the fae quite well. The Grace siblings' encounter with elves was riveting, as was the trick they played to earn Jared's freedom. I suspect their next encoutner with the sidhe will not go well."
4,Interesting,"This book of the series was an interesting one. It didn't include much action though. Anyway, it was a good installment in the Spiderwick Chronicles. It could have been better."
4,Lucindas Secret Spider Wick Chronicles Book 3,I love this book i think this is the best one in the Spider Wick series. I think you should read this book because it is adventures and exiting they fight creatures alot and there are faries in this book. This book is prettty easy to read it is not to long and there are pictures in this book. This book even made me read more and read longer books.The other Spider Wick books are good to read all of them there are only five books in the series the last book is the longest.I think u should read this book maybe the whole series it is the best!
5,it work real good,Mike M you must have the audio video to the front of you VCR but they are for input only you have to hook them too output on back of you VCR then go to my DVDselect the Record Direct-to-DVD or Record Direct-to option to start creating a DVD directly from your VCR. so I hope this hope you but if not Please email me at dayrider@bellsouth.net & I will explan more to youGod bless youWebster
5,It Works,Along with DVD Decrypter and Shrink... free s/w out there... it works very nicely. Some cheap DVD media might be a problem.I have copied many a VHS and DVD and CD...rarely a prob.I also have Nero..the Version u can buy for about $8.It all comes together. Also have a newer Dell laptop with power.I am not that computer savvy.
2,Sigh..... Salvatore should go back to writing decent books,"I have grown tired of TSR's administering their desires on how he writes his books. Why bring back Wulfgar? Does there have to be immortality among heroes? Salvatore's first books on Drizz't and the companions were well done, his books on the story of the drow were fantastic, but the use of the drow is getting old. The stories he is recently producing seem too much re-hash of the other books he's produced. Don't get me wrong, the first parts of the series were fun and creative, but his latest works are suffering from the same storyline. Unfortunately, I feel the series has become rather stagnant.. That, and I've progressed to better, more realistic authors like Glenn Cook (The Black Company) and Steven Brust (Jhereg) that have shown me the light on realistic vs. typical fantasy."
5,Just another drizzt book,This book is pretty good if ya want somethin to read. But really its just another normal drizzt book. Its not as good as passage to dawn or the spine of the world but its pretty good. Their are a bunch of cool battles the best one is the main battle. I liked this book I dont know if u will but I suggest u read it anyway.
2,puppet point of view,"I found this too basic to use for puppet -plays in church, would work in a Sunday school situation.I liked the symbols to help children with knowing the kind of facial expression to use."
3,More religious nonsense...,"More religious nonsense concerning that man-made concept..However, cute stories and useful to my Animatronics work.MJL"
3,Field Owner,Very good product. Does not fit all HPA tanks. O'ring is having to be replaced on every 4 fills.
4,Walks were great!!,I ordered the buddy system hoping that it would save my hands and arms from my strong dogs. The leash system is great; I walked my dogs three times yesterday. My husband was skeptical until he tried it and now he loves it too. My dogs are very strong and I never felt like I had full control with a regular leash. They responded very well to this system. They have nearly stopped pulling and walks are more enjoyable. The only down-side is that the belt loosened up during the walk.
3,So so choice,"The waist part of this leash is fine. If you walk, it's fine. But I found the leash to be too short for running with my dog on the trails. I just attach my regular leash to the waist belt and off we go. I have to wrap the leash around my waist when we run off leash. A pain, but at least I don't need to hold a leash while running"
4,Great for quick morning fix,"The Toddy Maker is a great way to have reliable supply of caffeine, even when you're short on time or half-awake in the morning, or camping (just bring the concentrate).And of course, you have to have filters to use the Toddy, so I'm relieved that these are still available for my trusty maker.Hand wash the filter with a little dish soap, let it air dry, and it's good to go for many uses."
2,"Not bad, but not good either","I really wanted to like this book, but it didn't happen. I love the cover and I like the pooch (Earl Gray). But I found the characters dull. This book took me forever to read because it didn't interest me. Despite my boredom, I'm reading the second book in the series. And, I must say, that Theodosia Browning is just as dull in this book. On the other hand, I am enjoying reading about the teas--and I'm not much of a tea drinker. Those who like to drink a lot of different teas will likely love this aspect of the book."
2,Not for a discerning reader......,"This book was recommended to me by a fellow tea shoppe owner so I found it on Amazon and downloaded it to my kindle in anticipation of an enjoyable read. I am a very avid reader so I thought this would be fun! Unfortunately for me, this was a grueling book to get through...it was only through my commitment to never let a book go unfinished that I got to the end. It tried to be a murder mystery with random forced references to tea or Charleston. I thought the whole book was elementary in writing style and the story was so fictional and lacking depth it was painful to read....."
3,Gald to have finally seen it,"My main interest for this DVD was the music of Pink Floyd.There are several films that have music by them which are hard to get in Europe (VHS was available from the US, but always in the wrong format for European video recorders).The film itself has wonderful shots of the impressive nature of New Guinea but the story line isn't all that great. Dated is what comes to mind.The transfer to DVD even has a visible problem after 15 minutes or so into the film (there is a warning about this on the DVD box) which has caused synchronisation problems.All in all I'm glad to have finally seen this film now, although the soundtrack CD of course is a better representation of the Pink Floyd film score.Now let's hope 'More"" and 'Zabriskie Point' also appear on DVD."
1,Not what I expected.,I figured any movie Pink Floyd would do the soundtrack to has to be great! It wasn't. All in French with no subtitles and there was a scene where bushmen slaughtered a pig at which point I shut off the movie & could watch no further!
3,Movie goes no where,"This movie gets 3 stars only because of the acting, filmwork, and music. But the storyline is uneventful and doesn't go anywhere. It's really not that trippy or amazing. I don't know what people are talking about. And usually I am the positive thinker. Do yourself a favor and get something else."
1,A DOG FIGHT SET TO TRIPPY MUSIC?,"Somebody can explain the difference between real dog fights being videotaped----and the scene in this movie where a poor real pig gets its head smashed in.This french movie in which jungle natives kill a pig probably was ripped off by francis coppola, for APOCALYPSE NOW, in which jungle natives kill a water buffalo.And there's also the '60s hippie/Black Panthers/Charlie Manson lingo of pigs = cops, so dig the symbolism! Wow, that's groovy, and deep.Even forgetting that bit of intellectual/artistic cruelity to animals, there isn't much to this movie, beyond some good photography and some ancient pink floyd music.Nothing special about the actors, or dialogue, or even the few seconds of nudity. And the plot is soooo 60s/70s, with some petite bougeize into the jungle to find some feather and the meaning of life, man.If you like real dog fights or cock fights, you could buy this and fast forward to the pig slaughter scene, mon amie."
3,"A non-fiction ""Memoirs of a Geisha""","Given the subject matter, this book is remarkably dry. I'm sure this is attributable to the limited personal information available to the biographer, who I suspect did a heroic job pulling the book together from the numerous sources she used. Still, we can never quite get inside the protagonist's head, and it is always frustrating to finish a biography without really understanding what made a character tick (except in certain obvious ways). It is an interesting story, and if you're interested in the history of the fascinating city of New Orleans, it is probably a must-read, even with its shortcomings."
3,"Money, Power, the wild life in New Orleans.....has always","interested me. This book did not let me down. Interested in History, biographies, interesting powerful and resourceful women......read how this woman succeeded ......even unto her death.....a must read! Loved it, in fact love it reading it again......."
4,"A fun read, well-researched","This book was a fun read and seemed well-researched, lots of works cited, and lots of suggested reading on similar topics.A lot of the less satisfied reviews seem to feel it is poorly written, but I didn't think so. It was a little corny at times, but not unforgivably so.One criticism I read that I do agree with is the desire that the author had fleshed out some characters besides Norma a bit more. It's hard to keep straight which lover is which, especially when so many of them are policemen. A few of the prostitutes who work under Norma are fleshed out a bit, but not quite enough that I could remember which name went with which background. I have a pretty shoddy memory, so maybe that's my shortcoming and not the authors. That said, I read it purely for fun, not a burning need to study history, so getting names mixed up was just a minor inconvenience for me. I still enjoyed the story."
3,Warning - only four of the eight listed songs appear on disk,"This ""Live in Holland"" collection lists that it contains 8 different songs - 4 on each of two disks.What you REALLY get is one disk with the 4 ""Breakout"" songs, but you have to send in for the second disk that contains the ""Next Year"" disk of 4 songs.No Problem? Only if you live in Holland!! You must send your request to Holland in order to recieve the songs that you thought you had already paid for.Unless you are willing to send a non-english written form to Holland, and pay shipping costs, you will not recieve the songs, ""Next Year"", ""My Hero"", ""For All the Cows"", and ""Monkey Wrench"".The 4 songs on the ""Breakout"" disk are very well done and may be worth the purchase price if you are aware of what you are really getting for your money."
2,Too Many Props!!!,"If you don't have a bolster, blocks, etc...don't bother getting this DVD. I have blocks and blanket, but I don't have the bolster and other flat block thing he had. I was annoyed and the props needed should be listed on the back of the video!Also the Yin workout moved a little too fast. Not for beginners in my opinion.Overall rating: 2.0"
3,bad company strikes back :P,"bad company showcasing their production work_hUraH!you gotta love it when d & b producers release a full-length album... now if only technical itch would release one..._ _anyway, like i was saying_ _good stuff_ and as a bonus they include a mix cd of all their tracks_yEaH! its not a great mix cd_but hey_its like an added bonus_if you gotta good system this cd is 100% garaunteed to loosen your colon faster than turboLAX_ definately NOT recommended for fairies or candy_ravers..."
2,good but not da best,"i aint feelin this cd,good cd altho im into da proper heavy dark dnb this cd just sounds a piece to commerciall to me,if ya want sum proper dnb look to dillinja,limewax,dylan,dom & roland,ed rush,tech itch,you will prob find sum better stuff coming from dem mans than this cd,summary;good cd,mix is better,but not great.i wouldn't cream my pants over it!!"
4,Good Enought for Me,"I don't usually like stuff with words, but this is too good to pass up. Just get it."
2,Not Fulci's Best.,"This film is really not Fulci's best work. The storyline is weak and is fairly boring, although there is some worthwhile gore scenes, and of course, lots of ocular trauma.Only if you're a real Fulci fan, would I recommend seeing this movie at least once. Otherwise, I would leave this one on the shelf."
2,Fulci asleep at the wheel...,"Now, some might disagree here, but Fulci wasn't exactly a great director. Bava blew him away, and Argento came in at a distant 2nd, but Fulci only had like 4 decent films, and those with almost no plots. This film, being part of his many attempts to return to horror, the fact of the matter is, goes limp. All good gore fans saw House, Gates, Zombie and the Beyond, and with good cause, cuz' they're the only semi-watchable films he made. This film had 2 or 3 cool gore scenes, ridiculously overdone, and completely unestablished. There were two shots of nekked nuns which added to the film's quick-scan-ability on DVD, otherwise, not worth a half hour of anybody's time. The plot rots, but the image transfer is great. Trust me, save your dough and buy something with replay value."
2,Decent book at best,"I had to buy and read this book for class there are 40 or so people that wrote the book the styles are all over and some of the chapters seem to go on rants about irrelevant things, but some are really good chapter 10 for example was a good one"
4,Curriculum Course Book,The book is interesting as it provides the views of many national experts in education on curriculum. For the price it should be a hardback.
4,Good book,This book is about a girl who is living the good life with her parents. She is homeschooled. She suddenly has to go back to school which she hates. I recommend this book to boys and girls within ages 9-12.
1,most selfish unlikable character,"I'm a 10-year-old home schooler, and I'm offended If people think that home schoolers are like that. Ida is a BRAT! I hated this book!"
5,Excellent book!,"I am a 5th grade teacher and I read this book to my class. They loved it! I was pleasantly surprised because it focuses on environmental issues, family issues, and a conflicted little girl with a massive vocabulary. My inner city kids absolutely loved this book and still mention it whenever I finish reading them a novel."
3,Ida B Applewood,"Kelly J.Would you like to read a book about adventure and friendship? Then you should read Ida B! This book is by Kathrine Hannigan.Ida B is about a girl who's life gets turned upside down when she and her family move to a new home and all of the trees around her get cut down. Then her mom gets cancer,but still lives. At the end she ends up finding a new friend that she would have never expected to be her friend.My opinion of Ida B is right in the middle of happy,sad,boring and exciting. I would reccomend that you read this book Ida B!!"
5,"Belkin cat6 cable is the best gigabit network value, period.","Belkin cat6 cables are a must-have for our gigabit home network. Consistent quality, reliable. Highly recommended for use in any 10/100 or gigabit home network."
4,"Informative, but not Personal.","This is a good book, if you're looking for the more informative aspects of all eating disorders. The writing is very dry, does not include emotion, and is meant for educational purposes.This book was an easy read, not too much technical jargon to sort through. For what it is, it is a good book, though I'm sure there are other books on the topic that go further in depth into the details of each seperate disorder. This book shortly touched on various types of disorders, as opposed to really digging into each one."
2,"Useless if you're searching for the ""why""","This very thick book is full of detailed research, and chock full of studies, but completely devoid of answers to questions about why one submits to eating disorders. I bought it trying to gain some personal insight as to why I felt ruled by this behavior, and after reading this tome, am still in the dark. If you want to do a research paper and site studies, this book is for you, but if you want some insight as to what makes someone give into the compulsive/addictive behavior, definitely look elsewhere.I gave it two stars because I didn't know how else to rate it. It was completely not what I thought it was."
2,Not worth the price,We purchased this for our 6 year old daughter thinking it had more educational value. Basically it's an electronic magna doodle (and maybe we just didn't read up on it enough before hand). Our 4 year old daughter loves it and doodles on it all the time but it goes through batteries like crazy. It takes 6 AA which only last 2 to 4 days depending on amount of use. We finally purchased rechargeable ones so we could afford to keep the toy running! We haven't purchased any of the cartridges so maybe there's more that we haven't seen yet. I wish we would have spend the money elsewhere.
3,Meh,"Not Saberhagen's best work, but worth reading. Good for boring snowy days with nothing to do. Easy to pick up after putting down."
3,Their cork stoppers,Not much to review on this babe. Their cork stoppers for my Buddy maker. I will purchase again when needed.
4,A return customer,"I bought this product for my father. I do not believe personaly that will improve his condition, but he believes and feels good by taking it. Therefore, I am buying more and keeping my 80+ years old father happy."
3,"Don't BUY this book, but read it","The message is good although the way of conveying it could have been improved. Nice anti-consumerism story told from the interesting viewpoint of the kid who both is and isn't Larry. There are of course parts that should have probably been taken out, but also parts that were great; Larry's ""sermons"" came through especially well, to make the reader think - after reading you start to wonder about your own life a little...Unfortunately, the one thing that most dampens the book's - and author's - message is the knowledge that, right next to it on the library shelf sits a book called 'Vote For Larry' (written three years later, I guess after 'Gospel' proved successful). Even in the best of us, capitalism rages on."
4,The Gospel According to Larry.,"The Gospel According to Larry was about an intelligent boy who wasnt like everyone else. He started writing sermon on an internet site that he created. He wrote about anti-consumerism and his opinions on it. As the site started to get popular alot of people started getting into anti-consumerism. After a while people started to get curious, some of his readers tried to find out who he was. After he was foumd out it pretty much ruined his life. He lost his best friend/ secret crush. I really liked the book. It deals with alot of issues teens deal with today! I really enjoyed it, and I would deffinately reccomend this book."
1,Ick,"I am so sick of writers that have no idea what teenagers are like. Teenagers don't talk like this! Teenagers don't THINK like this! But it's not just the teenagers. There's not a realistic character in this whole book.I know the author means well. Anticonsumerism is something I sympathize highly with. But the book is written in such a watery, preachy way that it's almost unreadable. The whole time I just felt like I was being ""appealed"" to with an adult's idea of how teenagers supposedly act. The end result just isn't appealing at all. Larry's sermons are banal and unoriginal. I don't see how this could ever happen in real life. There literally millions of anticonsumerist websites out there, and ALL of them are better than Larry's.TGATL is an unrealistic book targeted at pseudo-subversive teens. Don't bother with it unless you're very, very stupid. If you want a good book for teens about consumerist issues that's actually entertaining, check out ""Feed"" by M.T. Anderson."
3,changing the world,"Seventeen year old Josh Swensen is a highly intelligent senior who wants to change the world. The only problem is that Josh is a loner and no one in their right mind would pay any attention to him. But who is to say that they won't listen to is anti-consumer alter ego Larry, who urges people away from consumerism one sermon at a time. This book was well written but the best parts were the footnotes at the bottom of the pages. I liked the way that the main character developed, but I also thought that throughout the book he was a jerk. Now granted every book has their stupid people that you don't like, but it shouldn't be the main character. The little bits of humor enhance the story and make it a little more interesting to read, but if consumerism is no interest to you, then don't read this book."
5,Audio tapes of The Gospel According to Larry,"This is great unabridged version of the book, including the epilogue....I use it for my classes so we can stop and talk about what is going on in the book as we read along...I highly recommend!"
5,Wow!,"Unlike the other reviewer here, I know many other recordings of this work. From the Boston Chamber Players, to the Lincoln Center Chamber Players with James Buswell, with a great apotheosis in Szell's orchestrated version, issued by the Cleveland Orchestra in a private series. As the Szell version makes slightly painfully clear, this is not easy music to play. The really harsh and noticeable horn flubs in Szell's famous brass section are proof of that in the Cleveland version. This music does not sound terribly virtuosic, but manifestly is. This helps us get what is special about this version. This version with Collins is by far and away the most virtuosic performance I have ever heard. It is really deft, and made to sound effortless. It is simply a tour de force. Wow!In the past, used CD stores would not buy these BBC cheapie CDs, and thus did not sell them, and thus many I have not heard. . Now thanks to online auctions, I am getting to know them. There are clearly some gems."
1,"DO NOT BUY FROM HERNANDO GAMES in Brooksville, Florida!!!","I wanted to play this game, but the seller...HERNANDO GAMES and owner C.L. BRAND run a shady business. They sent me a game (I purchased as VERY NICE condition) that had scratches and smudges all over it. He then had the nerve to tell me that they buff and polish their games...what a crock! He told me he would handle this personally and told me I could keep the game, but would like to show his staff. I sent back the game because it would freeze at the end of the first stage or I would have kept it! Then he insults me by saying that he would expodite the order! Don't go through the same thing and buy somewhere else! There are thankfully businesses that keep their promise of satisfied customers!"
4,Good ideas for open communication,I got this book for my daughter who is going far away to college for the first time. She has never met her roommate and I wanted both of them to have a good experience. My daughter and I both read the book and thought it gave some great ideas for keeping the lines of communication open in a friendly way...on about every topic there is. It's a great book and I'd highly recommend it.
3,"Where is ""Love will follow""Is it too R&B????",To leave out one of Kenny Loggins best Hits is an insult to me.I believe this decision was a marketing strategy made by some genious at Sony...well guess what it was plain stupid..no one will tolerate this type of omission..guess i will keep looking.
5,He's Alright Don't Nobody Worry About Loggins,"Even though it could do without the duet with Michael McDonald at the end (out of order since it goes from LEAP OF FAITH to MORE SONGS FROM POOH CORNER to THE UNIMAGINABLE LIFE, it is the most complete collection of Loggins' works to date. It would be nice to see a box set of Loggins' works including some of his rareties (eg. his early work with Gator Creek with whom he did the first recorded version of ""Danny's Song"" with, his session work with Bill Champlin, Pages, Jim Brickman, EverettHarp, etc.) How's about it Kenny:D)"
4,The essential Footloose dude!,"This collection contains all of Kenny Loggins' fans' favorites. YOUR MAMA DON'T DANCE with Jim Messina is an awesome classic rock tune. THIS IS IT is an awesome duet with his close friend ex-Doobie Brother Michael McDonald. I love the showtunes I'M ALRIGHT from the 1980 Warner Bros. film CADDYSHACK,FOOTLOOSE from the '84 Paramount film of the same title and DANGER ZONE from Paramount's '86 blockbuster TOP GUN. This collection also includes a cover of another Loggins-McDonald hit WHAT A FOOL BELIEVES which won a multitude of Grammys for the Doobies in '79. WHENEVER I CALL YOU ""FRIEND"" is another Loggins duet,this one with Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks. VOX HUMANA from '85 is OK. Loggins should have recorded a personal cover of WE ARE THE WORLD(he was a USA FOR AFRICA participant in the hit recording which was '85's biggest-selling song). The other songs are great."
4,"""This is Kenny LOGGINS?""","That's what those unfamiliar with Mr. Loggins will say over and over again when listening to this album. My wife said it four times on the first disc alone.His Loggins & Messina cuts, coupled with his early solo work, have a classic 70's sound, and I mean that in a good way. It's a defining sound. You'll be surprised at the number of standards he's now responsible for.His late 70's/early 80's songs also perfectly capture THAT era, with a smooth, catchy pop-rock sound hallmarked by ""This Is It"" and ""Heart to Heart"". I mean, he even does a duet with Journey's Steve Perry!His 80's soundtrack work has those synth drums, keyboard fills and bouncy guitars that SCREAMS ""oh-so-80's"", and the movies ""Footloose"", ""Top Gun"", and ""Caddyshack"" (among others) had Mr.Loggins prominently featured during their key moments.His more recent work is less distinctive, but no less enjoyable.This is a smartly compiled set, with clearly improved sonics from the previous CD releases."
4,"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids - The Original Animated Series, Vol. 1","This series is great for teaching Character Education. You have the concept/Character Trait, then the story centered around the topic/concept, followed by music.This a a great teaching tool!"
3,This is a different band then Amon Duul 2,"Amon Duul and Amon Duul 2 are different bands. They both got their start in an anarcistic, multi media commune that formed in the late sixties in germany, under the name Amon Duul. They all agreed that they wanted to form a band. Those in the commune that had some musical training wanted the band to be truly ""musical"", while others felt that they should be more free form, and not worry about structure ETC. They decided to form two bands, Amon Duul ( which a friend of mine refers to as psychedelic punk ), and Amon Duul 2. Amon Duul 2 is considered to be one of the most influential German bands in the history of Prog."
3,"Good Idea, Horrible Execution","Rayman 2 on the load screens claims the name, ""Rayman: Revolution"", but a revolution it certainly isn't. The game pretty much is a port from the other Rayman 2's, just with special little PS2 type enhancements. It follows the same storyline and everything. It even has the same levels and stages, so if you own the other Rayman 2's, this is a waste of money.If you don't, it's still a waste of money. There is a lot of loading, and takes a long time. The game save eats up 270 KB on the memory card. It has alright game play, but NOT worth the money unless it's for a six year old."
5,TWyatt,Oh my Diana Palmer is just what you need when the weather starts to turn cool Her and a comfy spot & a throw because She'll do the rest she'll wrap your heart around her books and leave you feeling all warm & cozy!!!!! I have to admit I believe I'm totally addicted to her writting skills
2,Dream on...,"I realize this is one of Diana Palmer's older books, but the relationship between secretary Eleanor and ranch owner Curry bothered me. He was incredibly verbally abusive to her and she just took it and excused it. In the 2007 era the way Curry treated Eleanor would be verbally and emotionally abusive. So I guess based on that perspective I found myself asking myself why any woman in her sane mind would have stuck around to endure two weeks (her notice) of his actions. This was not what I would term a healthy relationship. I realize the author is getting from A to Z in the relationship in 200 plus pages, but puh-leez, can't we allow the female lead more dignity than to think so little of herself that she would put up with someone like this? But police, social workers and the like have been dealing with abused women and their refusal to leave an abusive relationship for decades--guess this is why Eleanor stayed. She loved him and was willing to endure his treatment of her."
4,Tender but Tame,"I have read many of DP's books. I love all the ""taut"" tension and passion that she does so well. This book doesn't have her trademark sexual encounters, but is still a great read! Very romantic and sweet. I have read it several times and continue to enjoy it!"
5,Well organized and an essential guide for getting started.,"This is a well organized book that covers just about everything you need to know to get started. You'll still have to do a lot of work on your own, but it tells you what to expect, how to find the info, and what to do to make sure you're covered legally. Sample documents and forms are also shown to help you in preparing your own or to be ready for filling out government forms. Given the price of the book, I feel the value of information in the book is a steal. It rates a 9 only because I didn't find the chapter on taxes to be as complete as I had hoped. There is a lot of good info on taxes but it's a little weak on some of the details."
3,Pigs don't fly either,"What an ego blow! Imagine being the only cat in the world incapable of flight. Woe is you...Wah, wah... Then, you discover you can swim and the other cats cannot swim. Total joy! Maybe this book is an epiphany on diversity. Maybe it means we should accept ourselves for what we are, as long as we have a super power no one else does. Maybe it means nothing at all... In spite of the really nifty watercolors a huge number of this title are offered for sale on the Amazon Marketplace."
5,"Mellow compliation with mood of ""Kind Of Blue""","Blue Miles compiles eight low key tunes from 8 different Miles ablums, including one track (Blue & Green) from ""Kind of Blue"". The eight tracks brought together here create a ""Kind Of Blue"" mood. If you like the mood of ""Kind of Blue"" I would suggest you purchase ""Blue Miles"""
5,Outstanding book. Sola Fide!,"I am a seminary student, so I read a great many theology books. Though quite short, this is easily one of the most important books I have read. It is absolutely excellent. Forde traces the arguements of Martin Luther, which were delivered in a 1518 debate. The book pulls back the curtains and forces us to look at how we have reshaped the Gospel to make it man-centered rather than God-centered. It explains salvation by faith in as clear a way as I have ever seen. Even before I finished the book, its content was finding its way into my Sunday School lessons and sermons. I only wish I had read it sooner."
2,I was disapointed!,"I was disapointed with this Cd, compared to the sound track.Only two songs I liked.I can't even remember if most of these where in the movie!I'm glad this was not expensive."
2,not the music i hoped for,the cd was in good condition but it wasn't the kind of music i thought it would be not the best purcahse ive ever made
1,wasnt worth the wait,"item was delayed for about a month, when I finally got the item. It was opened and box was flattened. Very very disappointed"
2,Not the best !,"This is the first dvd I have bought that I would not recommend. Limited information and really nothing you haven't seen on cable.The cost wasn't much more than what it would cost to rent, but no new information on these cases to make it worth buying.So I would give it a pass."
3,MEMPHISTO WOMEN ALTINA SANDALS,"SORRY TO SAY I HAD TO RETURN MY MEPHISTO ALTINA SANDALS, NOT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T COMFORTABLE, BUT THEY WERE TO NARROW. I WISH MEPHISTO WOULD GO BACK TO THEIR ""OLD"" SIZING. BROUGHT A PAIR OF MEPHISTO SANDALS YEARS AGO THEY WERE COMFORTABLE AND THE SIZING WAS ""PERFECT."" MAYBE IT'S THE MAKE OF THE SHOE."
1,shoe grabbed and caused me to fall,I have had this pair of shoes for 3 years and lately in the last 6 months I have discovered the shoe grabs and causes me to pitch forward .. i'm wondering if anyone else have had this problem?..
2,Epson R2400 Short Falls,"I purchase quite a bit of equipment for my company and I have to say this was one of the more disappointing ones. The deficiencies in this printer are only exaggerated by Epson's non English speaking technical people. And on top of that, Epson agrees there are issues that reduce the unit's capabilities. Wait until you have to replace all 8 cartriges when all you need is black. The drivers don't let you specify. There is an after market driver available, but get ready to put out $600. Then you have to usually special order those 8 cartriges. I could go on and on, but it would just take less time to buy a different printer."
5,Wonderful Prints,"I have always used Epson printers, I am a professional photographer and i am very happy with its over all performance. Afew little faults, but things i can live with. (swaping out inks) For consistent quality i would recomend colour managemant. i.e. icc profiles for the papers and moniter calaberation regularly."
4,Great printer,"Let me start by saying: YOU NEED TO CALIBRATE YOUR MONITOR WITH YOUR PRINTER TO GET THE BEST PRINTS. Also, go to Epson and download the printer profiles. I actually won this printer in a contest, and had never really used a top of the line printer like this. The first couple things I printed looked horrible, I was really disappointed. The color contrast was out of whack, they didn't ""pop"" at all. Then I went through the calibration process and things are much better. Try the velvet fine art paper, it's amazing!"
2,"Worked well, for less than two years!","The R2400 was a great printer while it lasted, but I purchased it in Feb of 2006, and by December of 2007, it has stopped accepting paper. In that time, it was rarely used, I had a second Epson printer (a cheaper all-in-one that I've had for over 4 years) for day to day stuff and the R2400 for graphic design projects, so needless to say, I'm a little surprised that in so little time, it has gone on the fritz.Obviously it's out of warranty now and I'll have to take it to a service center and pay whatever they ask me to pay since $800 is a lot to just throw away and write off."
4,The Epson R2400 lives up to it's billing,I have been very pleased with the R2400. It prints absolutely great photos in color and in b/w. The details really stand out. The only negative is the waste of ink when you change out the glossy black for the matt black catridges.
3,Emotionless,"The writing is excellent in this book, with every word and phrase meticulously chosen. However, as a story it falls a little flat. It is written in the first person, the main character being a well-brought up young lady. Her narration is certainly of its time, as she shows little emotion in the events she relates. When our heroine almost drowns and has to be saved by Minerva, it's as though she is retelling an incident she witnessed rather than something that had any major impact on her.If you're looking for a swash-buckling, rip-roaring adventure, this book isn't for you. However, if you want to lose yourself in the period and engage more with characters rather than run them through with a cutlass and laugh heartily, mateys, then you'll find this tale a treasure."
3,Unrealized potential,"You have to get to page 181 before the pirate adventure starts. I imagine this book was promoted and titled to catch the wave of interest in pirates that came from the Disney inspired movies. The best thing about the book is the information that is drawn from period documents, especially one by Daniel DeFoe that is credited several times. I thought the Maroons living on the island was especially interesting. The story glosses over some of the more harsh realities of what it must have been like to be a pirate and stresses the Robin Hood/Jesse James aspects. The idea of democracy also gets a boost. Supposedly inspired by two real-life female pirates, I doubt their life was quite like this. The plot seems to back off at any intense moment, especially at the end when I was expecting a big show down between the heroine and the dastardly villain who pursues her for most of the novel. While not a complete waste of time, the story seemed to have potential that was never realized."
3,Very Good But...,"This book was very good, but the title was just too dull. I mean if you're gonna write a pirate book, do you have to name it pirates!? Anyway, when I first heard about it I expected a real Pirates of the Caribbean, swashbuckling type of tale but instead I got a sea-faring well mannered pirate captain and his crew. It just wasn't my idea of a pirate book. And after waiting months for it to be realeased, I was dissapointed."
5,AN EXCELLENT STORY FOR ALL AGES FROM CHILDREN TO SENIORS,"WHETHER YOU ARE A CHILD ENJOYING A FAIRY TALE OR AN ADULT READING IT TO A LOVED ONE. YOU WILL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS THE CHILD IT WILL LIFT YOUR SPIRITS VERY HIGH AND PUT A SMILE AND A LAUGH IN YOU. THE PICTURES ARE SO FANTASTIC THEY ALMOST TELL THE WHOLE STORY IF YOU DON'T READ IT, AND WORDS JUST MAKE IT MORE SPECTACULAR. I CAN NOT RAVE ENOUGH ABOUT THIS BOOK. I AS AN ADULT HAVE READ AND REREAD THIS BOOK MANY TIMES JUST FOR ME! I HOPE EVERYONE YOUNG AND OLD TRY TO GET A COPY OF THIS TO READ FOR THEMSELVES AND TO OTHERS."
4,Like it,"I still think nothing compares to the sound of the ""Gran Combo"", still like this cd though. I do some DJ's and will play some of the tunes over the radio waves, Thanks Again, JAG"
5,"Great southern gospel songs in ""Shout 2003""","""Shout 2003"" continues the tradition of listening to and enjoying top- notch southern gospel music.It's great to hear and listen to top gospel hits from many well knownsouthern gospel artists . What you always hear is the ""cream-of- the- crop in southern gospel gospel music. You also get to hear many new southern gospel artists as well.Once you hear this collection of gospel music on this double cd set, you'll want to hear it again and again. Enjoy!"
2,Not worth the money,only thing my cats watched was the laser also its not on a loop so once it plays through in about 40 minutes you have nothing
4,Fun game but lots of talking...,"This game is great but there is a lot of movie clips that make up the plot. The plot is very plain and could of used some help, the plot is that you got to get a sword because an evil guy is going to rise and the good guy is dead. You have to sit through lots of movie clips to get to the playing part. I think there was to much of that. but on the upside the battle system is fun and keeps you wanting to play. It is fun but be prepared to have to wait for movie clips to play, you may like that but i think there was to much. But if u want a good rpg game then i definitly suggest this game. Its worth the price of the game."
5,what a game,"i had bought this game when it first came out, and i have to say this is hands down my favorite rpg of all time, i lost my job beacause of this game..days and days of fun,in my opinion its the best game on the dreamcast.....and remember 'SKY TAKE FLIGHT'"
5,simply incredible,"I found The Valley of Decision in a box of old books in a yard sale. I started to read it one evening when I was bored, not expecting much. Was I surprised. The writing is tight and clean. The plot has more twists than a pretzel. And the characters are so real and believable you'd think the book was a biography rather than fiction.This is the story of 3 generations and spans the time from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of WWII. It is the story of extreme wealth and utter poverty. It is the story of morals and pride and what happens when the two collide.I was so impressed with the book that I came here in the faint hope that I could find other books by Marcia Davenport. I will be definitely increasing my Davenport library. I even found on the web that this book was made into a movie in 1945.Well worth reading."
5,"Gut-punching, anti-phallus rock","An acquired taste, this CD took a while to accept, but now it's on heavy rotation. Very thought provoking, powerful debut.This album is enjoyable on its own but is especially fun when you compare it to One Beat or The Hot Rock. Such contrast is a testament to a band's evolution."
3,it was motor oil,"it did not destroy my car, nor did it confer superpowers to said car. so if you need motor oil, go for it."
5,Pretty great pants for the price,"I don't wear pants well, and they tend to fall apart after a while. I've had these for a few months and love them. The waist isn't too tight (which is nice for weight fluxes) and they fit well. They don't ride up on me when I bend over. Plus they feel nice to wear.I was a little skeptical about ordering pants on Amazon, but they didn't fail me. I hate going out and shopping and trying things on, so it was a leap of faith to do it via Amazon. The waist sizing is a bit liberal (compared to, say, Land's End) so you can go with what size jeans you normally wear for the waist size.Overall, I'm happy with these pants. I'd buy them again in the future if these pants ever fall apart."
3,Dacron polyester?,"I never owned a leisure suit in the 70's, but this is the material they were made of. What's wrong with cotton? I bought these ""Action"" pants for work & they feel like artificial dress pants.All I really wanted was a pair of Dockers in Navy Blue, but these plastic pants were the only kind available in that color.It seems like they're made of polyester in order to keep the creases permanent,but who needs razor sharp creases in a pair of casual pants?I hope they don't make jeans out of this material."
2,"Good fit, but really shiny","I was thinking these would be a bit more understated, slacks to work - but, they are so shiny that I haven't worn them. They do fit true to size. Definitely wish this was a blend and less disco."
2,Broke after a year!,"Unlike their famous mixers, this KitchenAid food processor isn't worth the money. It does not have all metal parts like the mixer and seems to be cheaply made.I used this 3-4 times a week on average for a year. The plastic part that holds the blade broke after a year (two weeks after the warranty expired) during normal use. I called KitchenAid and they gave me the name and phone number of a repair shop that repairs small KitchenAid appliances. It was the only shop in my area. I called the shop and they said they would charge me $60.00 just to look at it, plus the cost of repair and any parts that I needed! No thanks!KitchenAid needs to redesign this product and bring it up to the same standards as their mixer."
5,Common Sense,"This is a great little food processor for smaller jobs. A suggestion for the review below, if you are working with 16 cups of onions, use a larger machine. You wouldn't make a pound of spaghetti in a 1 qt pot, would you?This machine has convenience and looks, and is lightweight enough to grab for small to medium sized jobs, when pulling out an 11 cup processor just doesn't make sense.I highly recommend for chopping, making sauces, garnishes, etc."
2,Big let down!,"I played the game on/off for several days playing the rebels, (I like challenges). My major problems are the space maps are not that big, with all the firepower the IMP displayed in the game does not matter since the AI is a joke, and the game ended too quick. By the time I was getting ready to enjoy the game with some decent cruisers for a change the game ended.I would of love to play it through all the three movies, but it only centered on the first.Very disappointed."
5,JUST WHAT THE FANS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!,"This game is so AWESOME!!!!! I have been waiting for this game for a very, very long time. It was everything I hoped for, and more. There are two things I didn't like: One was the single player campaigns were too short. What about Episodes 5-6? What about the Battle of Endor? What about a Super Star Destroyer? Another thing I didn't like is: why couldn't the Death Star move, and fire on capitial ships? Why couldn't it have the thousands of tubrolasers it was meant to? I hope they inprove this in a sequle or an expansion. Anyway, for any Star Wars fan, this is a must-buy game."
3,Tough Game,The graphics on this game are excellent and the play interesting but I cannot get past the 4th scenario even on the easy setting. I think the game is meant for younger players with better hand and eye coordination.
1,"Dull, dull, dull",This album is so bad I never finished listening to it. Just took it to the second-hand store and was grateful to get $3 back. Why can't Connick put together one complete album of excellent material? He has one or two songs here and there on each album but always misfires with unbelievable skirmishes into musical territory no one could possibly enjoy. I think he just gets too cute. Boring!
3,Kind of blah...,"I am a huge Harry Connick fan, have seen him in concert... own many of his recordings... listen to his Christmas albums to the point of annoyance...That being said, I wasn't all that thrilled with this album. I purchased it for my wife for Valentine's Day but it's taken a backseat on the shelf for us.Maybe I'm just used to the remakes of a lot of these songs, but the tempo that HC uses here is just way too slow and boring. The arrangements are nondescript and overall it's just kind of blah.Personally, I'll stick with his other big band albums like Songs I Heard, We Are in Love, Come by Me, When Harry met Sally (soundtrack) and the Christmas albums."
2,Ruining the old standards,"Songs become 'standards' mainly because of their beautiful melodies, right? Why would someone with a wonderful voice, perfect for these beloved old songs, change all the tunes, even change some chords from major to minor, obliterate the melodies with jazzy interpretations, change the tempos, and render them unrecognizable?"
2,"Dull, dull","I love Harry, but am baffled as to why this entire CD is sooo slow. I was misled by their ""Harry returns to big band"" description into thinking that there would be some big, splashy numbers on the CD. But no, every single song is a slow ballad, orchestrated by a piano, slow drum, lots of violins. Every song sounds the same after a while. This CD is a bore. It gets 2 stars because it's fine as unobtrusive, playing-in-the-background dinner music, and because the first song, ""More"" is quite pretty."
3,Adding to the list of books....,"I'm somewhat disappointed in the content. The best anti-cancer approach is to eat foods that alkalinize the body. The blood pH must be 7.35 - 7.5 to actually beat cancer, depending on the type of cancer and the stage of cancer. Max Gerson's plan leads you to beat whatever disease you have, not just cancer."
3,Where`s the guitar player ???,"A good CD, but could be better if Dio had Vivian Campbell on guitar ... Tracy G CAN`T play guitar!! I was at Dio`s show in Rio de Janeiro(Brazil) and noticed that he plays even worse than in this CD."
4,just what i needed,it was a vary good fit was exactly what i was looking for fits gun and clip perfectly a + +
5,Though not LTJ's best still one of the best skapunk records,"LTJ nomally taking the ska/pop/punk route, this record's basically punk w/ horns {the heavy ska guitar has a punk twist} pez-core and all their new stuff is better but this is a super-tarrific compilation of some of their old 7 and 10 inches with great covers, 867-5309(jenny) is the best. if you're into ska/punk or pop-punk this is a must have and those who think they're ""punk"" and hate ska e-mail me so we can fight on-line"
5,COOL,"This is a really great CD it has 20 tracks that are really good. The CD costs about 12 dollars. If you buy it for more than that you are being cheated. All the tracks are great, the whole CD takes 52 minutes. All in all this cd was awsome. Don't start your collection with this CD, start out with Hello Rockview or Losing Streak"
1,"Fine, if you heard of ska a week ago from some pre-teen punk","As a fan of legitamate ska, this cd is the worst thing i've ever heard, from sodden start to sodden end. The adolescent frat-ska-punk-core-whatever from these low lifes is too fast and geeky to register any sort of emotional response whatsoever. I'd rather be sucked into a jet engine turbine than hear this dreck again. Ugh."
4,Cool Album,"This is a really cool Less Than Jake album. This was realeased just after Pezcore and has that same sound, sort of raw and rough around the edges, as opposed to the later albums like Borders and Boundaries, Anthem, and B is for B-sides, which have tighter horns and an overall smoother sound. This album has a lot of good stuff on it. It's energetic and fast like all of LTJ's work. This is a nice addition to your LTJ collection."
1,"Successful film, but the CD will put you to sleep...","I really liked the film. When I found the soundtrack in a bargain bin recently, I thought perhaps it would contain some nice background music for driving or for a living room Scrabble game. However, grief dominates the score, so much so that the experience of listening to this straight through became quite boring. I've been a fan of movie scores since the days of the first ""Alamo"" (Tiompkin) and ""Ben Hur"" (Roszka) but this one has too little variety to offer the ear."
4,Splendid,"After reading some of these revives I doubted a bit about buying this movie...But to my luck I didn&#65533;t hesitate and I can only say that I loved it, and one of the things I found really interesting and wonderful was that you feel like you are really watching other people, it has the touché of documentary and its all made in a way so its not this high glam, whom has the most money race&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;its honest and sweet, and down to earth.And I can only recommend it!!! Especially if you love movies, and maybe liked some of the other Danish productions like Festen."
3,Dialogue heavy,"This Danish DVD runs 97mins and contains English subtitles as well as captions for the hearing imparied. There are five theatrical trailers including Amelie, Birthday Girl, In the Bedroom, The Shipping News, and The Son's Room.This movie is dialogue heavy which means you will be doing a lot of subtitle scanning. For me this is not an issue, except that I could not get into the movie. So reading the dialogue became a chore. A nice little retreat from the mainstream if only this movie hits the spot for you."
1,italian for beginners,STILL have not received this item and it was supposed to be here in the first part of august.very diappointed
4,What a Difference this Book Has Made!,"I had my flute for a few weeks before buying this book. I had been learning via websites on the internet and all of that but knew that I needed more. This book has been just the thing. The songs are beautiful and diverse and relatively easy (although they get more complex as they go). The cd is invaluable. It alone was worth the money! But it was important to put it on my iPod so that each piece was labeled and I could co-ordinate it with the book and then play the songs. The cd itself doesn't tell you what song it is playing (that's why I gave it four stars instead of five, and also the book doesn't stay open well--needs to be 3 ring style). My skills have improved by leaps and bounds and these 40 songs will give me many, many hours of fulfillment playing my flute."
2,Anyone Know the title?,"Hey people, there is a blues song in the middle of this film. Stallone is listening to it while lying on the couch. Does anyone know the title to the song? If so please post a response and tell me!"
1,Disgrace....,"This man, supposed DJ, should not even touch a turntable.....This is the early house songs that you used as frisbees, or slided down the pavement on...because they stank..and they stilldo. The choice compilations, until now, has been exellent..disgrace.."
1,Waste of trees,"If there was a negative star rating, this book would get it. The wrinkles on my scrotum have more information pretaining to these trucks than this book does. Apparently to this book, 1980-1997 means 1980-1985. There is virtually no information about any other years. Just a sampling, this book says the PCV valve is on the intake manifold. Indeed it is, however there is no mention about having to remove the alternator and a bunch of ther junk in order to get at it. Complete waste of my money and the trees it is printed on. I will be taking this book back to AutoZone tomorrow. This review pretains to Haynes manuals for ANY vehicle, they all suck. Cough up the extra money and buy a Nissan Factory Service Manual, desigend SPECIFICALLY for your model and year. If you have a 1994 pickup, get the one for a 1994 pickup...NO information for ANY other years. It will run you over $100, but it's well worth it."
2,so bad it`s good...,"my roomate lended me this flick and i watched it. After the movie ""death cube"" this is without a doubt the worst movie ive ever seen. however i couldnt take my eyes of the screen because i couldnt believe how bad it was. get plastered with your friends and rent this movie and death cube."
4,The Future?,"This movie is supposed to be set in the future but I think that due to a low budget, they couldn't really capture a futuristic look. However, the action and the martial arts are great and all the acting is pretty good. The problem is the movie just looks cheap. If you can get past how cheap it looks, its actually a pretty entertaining story. I would watch it again."
4,Nice little pot,"First off, let me say that I wouldn't recommend this pot for anyone with an electric stove unless it's induction heating (which is what i use and it works great).The base is simply too narrow to be of any use to someone with anything other than gas or plain old fire.. and baking (can you say the best French onion soup ever?One more simple but crucial part to take note of is the height. It's short enough to make stirring of any kind a more delicate process, which even when carefully demonstrated risks spilling.Otherwise it works great, perfect for baking or making sauces and soups for one.It's a very specific design: perfect for a few tasks but certainly not a crowd pleaser."
3,Be sure to buy the bulk option!!! Just like in the hospital,"When we had our newborns, the hospital used nonsterile gauze instead of baby wipes, along with water. This was less irritating than baby wipes, and also much, much cheaper.But when we left the hospital, we couldn't find these in the store anywhere. I purchased a few different gauzes from Amazon, before I finally figured out that we needed the ""nonwoven"" type.These 4x4 nonwoven nonsterile packages are perfect for wiping baby's bottom! Soft and absorbent. We found the medline brand to be slightly softer than the dynarex(sp?) brand.EDIT JANUARY 2013For some reason, amazon switched this listing to the 200/box rather than 2000/case! At $8/box, these are not a good deal!Search for the 2000/case for only $30!!!Medline Caring Non-Woven Gauze Sponges-4 inch x 4 inch, 4-ply, Non-Sterile, Bulk,2000/Case"
3,Well......,"I thought that it was okay, just cause it was from ltj. But Grease? come on! The songs are okay i guess you could buy it...but get ""losing streak"" and ""hello Rockville"" first those two really kicked some a**!"
2,big disapointment,"With so many Ska bands so famous for their covers, I had the best hopes for this CD but it falls short. It sounds like a hastily thrown together garage band version of these songs rather than often hilarious versions we've come to love from bands like Reel Big Fish.Save your money on this, less than EP sized, ""album""."
2,"Good idea, bad attempt","The idea was great, and I think this album would've rocked if they had just put more effort into the songs. They all seem pretty half-assed, and thus, don't sound very good at all. Only get this if you're a big Less Than Jake fan and want all of their albums."
5,Excellent Collection,"An excellent collection of WWII cartoons showing the day-to-day reality of Army life for the trooper. Very enjoyable to read. The book begins with cartoons about Army training, and continues on to Army life in the European theater, all from the viewpoint of the trooper. While a more complete collection is Willie and Joe: The WWII Years (vols. 1 & 2), the cartoons in this smaller volume are actually easier to read and at a less expensive price. This is the book to get if you are not familiar with Bill Mauldin's work."
4,I agree with Mauldin,"On the first page, Mauldin says he wanted to put the cartoons in chronological order but the publisher said so. I do think that would have been better. Other than that, it is a very worthwhile book. I bought it to use with my US history class for high school juniors."
5,A MUST KEEPSAKE FOR ANY MILITARY PERSON,"EVERYTIME I OPEN THE COVER TO THIS OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION FROM A MAN WHO WAS THERE,I CAN TASTE THE MUD OF THE FOXHOLE AGAIN. WHO CAN EVER FORGET THE CAVALRY JEEP WITH THE BLOWOUT."
2,I'M TALKING ON THE PHONE!,"The film stars Treat Williams and Huggy Bear. Antonio Fargas struggles with the accent which ranges from Mexican to Jamaican. The two live in paradise in Mexico away from the ex-wife (Janet Agren). The water is infested with intelligent shallow water sharks who can pull a boat by the anchor line. Not to worry, David (Treat Williams) can out swim and out hide those smart sharks. David's brother(Carlo Mucari) has some sort of mafia dealings where he blackmails them with a CD disc claiming to have information or something.To make a long movie short, the disc ends up with David and the mob wants it back. This leads to...whatever except a night scene with sharks, the title of the film. The plot was confusing, but the movie wasn't that great that I really cared. It was funny in an unintentional way. This is not a horror film, but rather a crime/thriller in the loosest sense of the words.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief poolside nudity."
4,nice toy,Very nice toy. I give it four stars because the main part (butterfly's body) has a small opening at the base where the dirt and small insects (ants) can get inside but it is virtually impossible to clean up since the body is solid.
4,Rites of Autumn(History of Modern College Football),"College Football is fast becoming America's newest pastime. There are always those who will argue baseball is better, but college football is always talked about from July through February with a childlike zeal. ""Rites of Autumn"" attempts to give a history of the coaches and players that shaped the sport into the NCAA and NFL we know today. The series is ten episodes narrated by Burt Reynolds and each one has themes similiar to a Ken Burns' documentary. The only holes in the show are the lack of information on teams other than Alabama,any Big Ten teams, Notre Dame, USC,Oklahoma, and Miami. There are many teams that really helped shape the sport that were totally looked over. Perhaps time did not permit, but this is a very entertaining view of sports history. Overall I would recommend anyone at least renting it or borrowing from a friend because if you love football...you will love ""Rites of Autumn""."
4,Air Intake Hose 696-701,I also received this product within a few days of ordering.I agree with what Roche stated. The hose was a perfect fit for my 92 Camry V6.But it's not a Dorman product which is why I rated this product 4 stars instead of 5. Since the price was right and the hose fit I felt satisfied with my purchase.
4,Kudos!,"I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theatre, and I've continued to love it over the years in its DVD format. My ONLY complaint about it, in fact, is that it does not have subtitles! Even though it is in English, it's in ENGLISH-English, and as an American I frequently find it hard to understand films coming from the British Isles. I miss much of the dialogue and that's a shame, because in such an enjoyable movie you want to catch every word. But buy it anyway."
4,"good music, good acting, good story!","it's boy meets girl -- though they already know each other from having gone to school together many years ago... an ALL BOYS school. yes, the girl used to be a boy. This is a British film and it has lots of 1980's Brit-alt-rock - the songs ROCK! (""Ever Fallen In Love"" by The Buzzcocks for example) The story is fast-paced and doesn't bore. a bit of drama comes when the two friends are tossed into a paddy wagon by some acerbic cops. one of the themes in this movie is just precious: with a simple kind action you can positively alter someone's psyche forever!"
4,"Sandra Dee, a beauty","This was one of the first Sandra Dee's movies, and the director was the famous Vincent Minelli, Liza's father.The cast included Rex Harrion (My Fair Lady), Kay Kendall (Les Girls, Genevieve), John Saxon (Portrait In Black)It's a romance comedy, from a time of innocense...I recommend it for those who aprecciate such kind of movie."
3,Remastered,"As John Saxon Fan it was a must for me to get this movie on DVD. His Co-Stars are Angelea Lansbury, Rex Harrison, Kay Kendall and Sandra Dee as his love interest.Its a nice and funny comedy (I would rate the movie with 5 stars) which lives specially with Rex Harrison and Kay Kendall and good dialogues.DVD:The picture quality is ok but by far not very good or perfect. The soundtrack sounds like to be in stereo (the product scription on the DVD cover write: mono).Well, allways at Warner Archives, the biggest MINUS point: no subtitle.* * * For the 21 Century a big shame * * *"
5,Wonderful wonderful wonderful Film,"I first watched this on the Television in the mid '90s, just because it happened to be on, but going back to it on video - not available here in UK, but bought from some punter in CA USA the other day - made me realise that it was not just much better than I remembered, but that there were other layers which added a great deal to the hilarity.One of the best films for a family audience - good for any age over 6. Sandra Dee is dreamy, but Kay Kendal is a hoot, with looks to boot, and comic timing with the best of them. Rex H. plays his part to a T."
5,La traducción como producto autónomo,"El libro está escrito de manera totalmente amena y coloquial. La teoría del argentino Viaggio, basada en la de Landa, supone del traductor la aplicación de una teoría de la comunicación integral que hace del texto meta un texto autónomo. Este libro es de lectura obligatoria para todo aquel que se precie de traductor profesional."
2,Still waiting for Mechwarrior on the xbox 360,"Great graphics, nearly impossible to follow levels... They're not hard just it's hard to figure out what's next. very little help is given, you just end up restarting levels and heading off in different directions hoping to find what your supposed to do."
1,WARNING! The servers are closed! Do not buy this!,The servers for this game have been taken down. The single player mode is little more than a tutorial for the online multiplayer. With the servers down you cannot play multiplayer. So essentially this game is unplayable. If you buy the disk you will be buying little more than a demo.
1,If you don't have XBOX Gold - RUN AWAY,"This game SUCKS. The single player is VERY shallow, and short. There IS NO MULTIPLAYER on splitscreen. ALL the multiplayer is XBOX 360 GOLD. Unless you already have XBOX Gold, THIS IS A WASTE OF $60.I had really high hopes for this title; I used to trust Sega as a publishing house. While they got the graphics right, and the gameplay is fun (though can't hold a candle to Mechwarrior), the single player is just NOT WORTH IT.My friends tell me XBOX Gold multiplayer is good, but I wouldn't know. At least with a PC game, they give you a month or two of free online access for your $60.STAY AWAY."
4,Good Mystery,"I found the first of the Beau Brummel series enjoyable, especially since discovering he was a real person -- as were most of the characters in the book. The mystery was good, but I especially liked the details of living as Nobility in Regency England. The main character is witty, his valet his long-suffering and funny. I liked the addition of the cat to the household and the angst he causes the valet. I've since read two more in the series. They should be read in order."
4,The Enchanting Beau Brummell,"I was totally caught up in ""Death on a Silver Tray"" from the very first page. My usual mystery reading revolves around medical and techno thrillers, so this was a completely different read for me and I loved it. Rosemary Stevens has brought Beau Brummell to life and beautifully depicts the Regency era of England. Brummell's character kept my attention. I stopped thinking of him as a superficial fashion confection and came to see him has a true and loyal friend to those he cares about. What I especially enjoyed is the way he deftly and subtely insulted those who are overbearing and arrogant, with them smiling all along!This was a fast, fun read filled with great humor and the killer is a complete surprise. I was way off base with my suspect. I'm actually looking forward to the next Brummell installment."
4,Lingo Voyager 12 is great.,"The Lingo Voyager 12 is easy to use, flexible and powerful - yet still small and lightweight. An extremely nice feature is the ability to use any of its languages as the base language, not just English. The screen is large and easy to read. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 is that the spoken voice is a bit difficult to understand if you don't already know the language. However, the included earbud helps with that. Overall, I would recommend this product."
5,LOVED IT!,A fantastic book. And I loved Seize the Night even better. Koontz's wonderful imagination made my mind soar! Keep them coming.
2,Disapointing!Terrible!,"Koontz is an excellent storyteller under his normal works, but he faltered incredibly on this first-person view book.Stay away from first person Koontz!"
3,Perfect winter afternoon read,"This novel is perfect for spending a snowy afternoon reading. It has enough action and drama to keep you turning the pages. Just don't think about it too much during and after the read--and DO NOT try and explain it out loud. If you do you will realize just how ridiculously retarded the plot is, and how it actually would be better suited to a Saturday morning children's show rather than a bookshelf in the ""Thriller"" section."
3,Kelly,"Dean Koontz' book Fear Nothing, was an excellent read because the way Koontz desribed every event happening in the story with great details. He gave you enough detail for you to be abe to make an active picture in your head. The main character, Chris, had a tough life as young man because he is unable to go out into the daylight and has lost both his parents.Fear Nothing is really a thriller that will leave you always wanting to ready more."
2,Very Dissaponited,"I am a huge fan of Dean Koontz but after reading books like Sole survivor and intensity i cant help feeling dissapointed. The characters are well developed with the main one Being Bobby who has a dog called Orson (who likes to drink beer) and his girlfriend Sascha who is also a deejay. The story is a bit too lose for my liking the story develops well with you finding out his father and the suspicious circumstances but then the story falls flat on its back. I would read this book again as i am a huge fan of Dean Koontz and own nearly all his books, but it wouldn't be the first on my list"
2,"Can you say, ""Stinks like do-do""?","I didn't much care for this one. It took over half the book for the plot to really kick in and nothing exciting happened until the last 50 pages. Even then, the ""excitement"" was pathetic and sad. I'm somewhat intrigued to find out what happens next in the story. However, I don't think I can stand to read another 400+ pages on a 12 year old reading level."
2,A great author repeating himself,"I used to be a HUGE fan of Dean Koontz. Some of his early novels created a truly new horizon for sci-fi/action. Unfortunately it is now obvious that Koontz needs a new source of inspiration. This ""Watchers"" part 2 could have been great if the author had been able to develop his story more around the challenges of a disabled person than using the old ""talking dog"" story.Endless descriptions render the story painful to read. You'll be waiting a lot for meaningful action."
2,"If you've read ""watchers"", you've basically read this book.","With the exception of the lead character having a physical disability, this book is pretty much the same as ""Watchers"". Koontz even made the two animals characters the same, one a super intelligent dog who is definitely man's best friend, the other a rage-filled monkey and his buddies intent on killing all humans. The writing is way too verbose, with Koontz over-describing everything from the color of the leaves on the trees to the way the wind blows through the grass. He could have cut out about 50 pages and it would have been the same book. I'm a big Koontz fan, and I'd have to say, don't bother."
2,not his best effort,"I can't believe this isn't one of his first books. Generally you begin to care for the characters pretty quickly - not so in this one. We just weren't given very much information until the end and at that point I was simply glad to be through it. I usually can't put a book of his down - this one was put aside for days. I was disappointed in Dean for what I felt was ripping off Watchers, and when it became so blatant that he was doing exactly that , he just tried to explain it away."
3,Light and fluffy.,"I admit that I enjoyed reading this book. The suspense and action scenes were very well-written, and the narrator (Christopher Snow) was an interesting and likable character. So why am I only giving the book 3 stars? Because, by the end of the book, you realize that not much actually happened in 400+ pages. The entire book seems like an extended prologue to a much bigger, juicier story. Hopefully the book's sequel -- ""Seize the Night"" -- will be just that."
2,Not so good,"The characters were good. But I didn't like the story. Koontz builds the characters, describes the setting. But the story never kind of starts. When I finished the book I thought is this it? Nothing more? Just when the action started? I got the feeling the author must have got tired of writing this book and decided to abruptly terminate it."
2,Trucking Through....,"Being an avid reader of as many of Koontz's books as I can get my hands on, I have to say that this is very slow material to truck through..I am used to being on the edge of my chair, and waking up with bloodshot eyes because I cant put his books down until the wee hours. This book was a major disappointment, but not enough to keep me from pressing on with his collection..Love Ya Dean!"
1,What a stinker!,"I kept reading it cuz I thought it would get better. I mean it was a Koontz novel, I like Koontz novels... By the way for those of you who loved it and feel that those of us who hate it just don't like something different... You're right, if I wanted different I would have grabbed a book randomly off the shelf. I wanted Koontz style novel writing. This is not.I'll come here and read reviews FIRST next time."
1,I don't think that this was really written by Koontz.,"Why does it take so long for this moron Snow to get out of the house on fire? He wasn't familiar with weapons, but he was going to ""squeeze off a shot""? And with a Glock (really hip gun) no less. Why does the author's style suddenly turn surfer-hip when the scene changes to Bobbie's place? Why does the radio station manager, apart from being spectacular looking and referring to main character as ""Snowman"" (Hill Street Blues ""Pizzaman""), work the night shift. Whoever wrote this junk should be ashamed and have his or her license to type revoked. One star is one too many."
3,Starts Fast - - Ends Slow,"I found Dean Koontz book, ""Fear Nothing"" to be an overall satisfying read. The characters are very well developed. Chris Snow is very intelligent, and at times just short of hilarious. I enjoyed the plot of this story, and particularly the characters. The only problem I had with this novel, is it starts as a very quick read, but came very close to losing my interest in the last 60 pages. I have read a great deal of Koontz's novels, and I have to admit this is one of the only times I experienced this during one of his reads. However, I would recommend this book based solely on its great characters and stylized poetic writing. Not bad. But he's written better."
1,"Tell him, already!","This is one of those books that annoys. There is a secret in Moonlight Bay. It involves Chris Snow's past, present, and future. Conveniently, he doesn't feel compelled to ask many of those who might enlighten him. Or, when he does ask, the other characters talk around the secret or tell him he doesn't want to know (which he seems to accept). This all seems to be the author's device to maintain this story as a novel instead of novella (or short story). I found it frustrating and hoped for more twist and turns. Instead, it is Chris searching for the answer to the secret and being thwarted by his ""I'm too cool to ask"" or by those who seem motivated not to tell."
2,Not a typical Koontz,"This book is one of the few boring books written by Koontz. Normally, I'm one of his biggest German fans and I'm always looking forward to reading his novels. But the plot is uninteresting and not a bit frightening. Fortunately, I can read all his old ones again. :-) I recommend for new readers: Strangers, Lightning, Dark rivers of the heart, Watchers."
5,An excellent suspense thriller,It is an incredible suspense thriller that will not let you put the book down. It is a mind-boggiling story that will keep you interested at all times.
1,Koontz's worst,"This in my opinion, was Dean Koontz's worst book ever and I have read everyone of his novels. The characters were lame, the plot bad, and the endig was the worst. Koontz's needs to go back to his Phantoms and Lightning days, now those were great books. If this is gonna be the first Koontz book that you read, then don't."
5,Loved the dog Loved the cat,Dean I am one of your biggest fans.. I loved the book so much I named my cat. you guessed it M.J.
1,What happened?,I can't beleive you people like Gremlins 2 it's dumb. This time they are in New York City and they all hatch during the day but not night. It's good to see everyone back but what happened to Billy's parents? The only thing good about this movie is the big spider near the ending. The first Gremlins is the best stick with that one. This sequel is just lame.
5,Introduced to the next generation.,"This movie is a classic for me. I loved it as a kid and had the joy of introducing it to my son. He loves it, too."
5,Much better script than the first one,"I really liked this movie when I saw it in 1990. I almost skipped it because I had found the first one only so-so. But it's a lot of fun. The DVD release is a pretty sterling transfer considering it's 12 years old. If I had to pick between one and two, I'd go for two."
2,Get what you pay for...,"I shouldn't complain since I only paid less than $30 for the light, but it's cheaply made and had some parts bent when it arrived. We are using it, it was just going in an extra bathroom... but if you're expecting good quality skip it."
4,Ann Richards,"Ann Richards who sang with the Stan Kenton orchestra toward theend of its reign was a dynamic personality and voice, and what shedid not have as jazz instinct she made up for in uniqueness ofexpression. She had a big voice, and she ran with the giants forjust a short while. There isn't much around from her, as the big band erafizzled just as she was breaking out and she had to do other thingsin ""show business"" to get by. This CD shows her with Kenton at her best."
5,The God Father of Hypnosis,"Save your money on all the other books; this is the most complete works of hypnosis anywhere in the world. It's expensive and worth every penny. Ormond speaks simply, clearly and right to the point. If you're new at hypnosis or the most seasoned pro, you'll learn more than you could imagine from this book. Bottom line: get it, you'll thank yourself."
1,Cheap...and not in a good way!,These sponges are poor made and unravel after only a few uses (less than 6 showers). I used three of them before I gave up and returned the remaining sponges to Amazon for a full refund.
2,Hit&Miss,nothing new here.I think Kim Dulaney is a Talented Writer but this Book has to many cliches to it.everybody who reads the Book knows who the main subject is.now had she went into a different direction&had a fuller take with the Book then this Book would have been more interesting.
5,Very good video!,"It has everything: action, beautiful scenery, a handsome man, and great fishing! Even non-fishermen and women will like this....Jeremy debunks some myths about pirannahs -- I still don't want to go swimming with them, though!"
3,"Shelf works as advertised, with a few caveats","The shelf is sufficiently sturdy for storing boxes in our laundry room. It is one of the only shelves on the market to fit in this narrow space. However, per the provided instructions the 200 lbs/shelf rated load capacity only applies if that shelf is individually screwed into a wall stud. The holes in the back of shelf did not line up with studs in this location, so I could not drill it into the wall. Also, the shelf arrived with some plastic sections cracked/broken off."
3,Track 23 and 32,I liked the hidden tracks better the rest of the album. Why didn't they include them in the regular line up? The 2 tracks sounds more like the Crazy Town of the first album (which I loved) With the 3rd album they should do 11 or 12 songs more along the lines of these 2 tracks and they'll have a hit!
2,Second revised Post,"Reviewer: Susan from Brentwood, NYI generally don't like this album. Some songs aren't that bad like their new single Drowning, and Beautiful is ok..... but I hate all the songs that have stupid lyrics like ""got so many tattoos...."", blah, blah blah.. and all that egotistical macho bs... just listen to the first track and you'll know what I mean. Also, they soo switched their vibe to try to sound more Linkin Park like - which everyone is doing... get one rap guy and one melodic singer, throw in a rock background... but it is just weak!! I know it's not on the album, but doesn't the song they did with Paul Oakenfold ""Starry-eyed surprise"" sound EXACTLY like ""Butterfly""??"
1,A Not So Good Album For A Not So Good Band,"Ok... they are popular because of the singles ""Butterfly"" and ""Revolving Door""....but that's an old story .. I Have listened to this album several times but i cant find a single that will surely knock out any of the singles from the first album... Well if you want to buy this album... forget it ... Buy Linkin Park's ""Meteora"" or Lacuna Coil's ""Comalies"" instead.Or better yet ... the old Crazy Town Album.. ""Gift of The Game"""
4,GROWER,The first time you hear this you think poop. Then you listen to it another time and you begin to like it. You know how it goes. Eventually you love it. It's not as raw as the last album and the tracks are quite short so if you listen to it in one go it sort of sounds like one long song - but most of the tracks are good! If you like Limp Bizkit or The Lost Prophets you'll like this. It is a good album and deserves a place alongside your other albums so buy it.
4,The new and improved Crazy Town,"After listening to Crazy Town's first cd ""The Gift Of The Game"", I didn't think that their was much future for these guys. I was wrong. This album shows they have matured into one of the elite in rap/metal. ""Darkhorse"" shows a more lyrical side to the singers Shifty and Epic. They both seem to be more synchronized with each other vocally. The band it self has also matured into an excellent band. This cd is definetley worth a shot.Key Songs - ""Battle Cry"" ""Decorated"" ""Skulls and Stars"""
4,Fun to watch,CRASH OF THE MOONS is a good old Rocky Jones adventure and it's fun to watch it. But be informed that it is recorded in the EP mode.
3,Not exactly what I had in mind!,"Overall, I think that this is a great cookbook. It's in a great 3-ring plastic binder that will stay open while you're cookin', and you can wipe off just about any ""grahdoo"" that you splatter on it. There are tons of recipes in it, but they're just not what I had in mind. I'm from Texas, and I know that most of the folks who wrote these recipes are from Utah and thereabouts. I guess they eat differently than I. Most of these recipes are modern dishes that you'd find in the kitchen, adapted for dutch ovens. But I was lookin' for more backwoods, down-home, stick-to-yer-ribs type grub. I'd rather have 20 good recipes like that. Another thing is that there's not much in the book about cookin' over an open fire, which I prefer because it's more authentic. Anyway, to each his own. Coincidentally, I'm still lookin'."
2,"Not up to the standard of ""Maria"" on Teldec","This discs shares the two main performers (vocalist Jairo and bandoneonista Binelli) with the Piazolla operetta ""Maria de Buenos Aires"" on Teldec. That CD deserves 4 or 5 stars but this one is a cheapo on 3 counts. Firstly the general quality on this Milan isn't as good as the Teldec, even though it was recorded recently (1996). Secondly the playing time 39'31 is skimpy. Thirdly there are no texts and barely a word on the collaboration between Borges and Piazolla. When some of the tracks are simply poems read by actor Lito Cruz you'd think the poetry would rate equal treatment in the booklet. Not a great advert for other releases from Milan Records."
3,Beware... half of the toys are not so baby friendly,"I thought this was a great little package of toys, but I'm not in love with it. My daughter loves the little fish which has fabric on the ends. However the clown face mirror toy is really heavy and hard - she bonked herself really good a couple times so we put it away! Same with the little phone... they are just way too hard and with an uncoordinated baby they can leave some serious marks on their faces! The teether is okay... it's kind of cumbersome for my baby to hold."
4,Great Toys for Babies,"Best thing about this package is that you get 5 toys for one price, one for the crib, changing station, diaper bag and grandmas with one to rotate. Most of them can be hooked onto car seats or play gyms for added fun. They are colorful, sturdy and fun!"
4,Not an easy item to find in stores!,"Unique set, very nice. My niece likes the, granted she's a bit small to let me know but I can see it in her eyes. Very colorful and each one is different, Highly recommend for baby!"
1,Outland on the cheap,"I attempted to watch DARK DESCENT but failed. I saw enough to recognize that this seemed to be a remake of OUTLAND which in turn was a Sci-Fi translation of HIGH NOON. Both OUTLAND and HIGH NOON are classics with great casts and well crafted scripts, but DARK DESCENT is a remake of these classics only in the sense that Frankenstein's Monster is a recreation of humanity. Some of the parts are there, but you don't want to take them home. There is a lot of dialogue, none memorable, and little action. The plot pacing favors insomniacs. Many of the actors are unknown even in their own native countries, whatever they may be. Let's not forget the special features, which consist of a menu that offers a single ""choice"": ""play movie"", thus demonstrating that the menu's only useful function is to demonstrate that it has no useful function. I gave the movie one star because it is better than daytime television, but my advise is get OUTLAND and watch the best Space Western ever made."
5,Winterberry Dish Set,I was very pleased to receive my Winterberry dish set in record time and in excellent condition. I am very pleased with my Amazon purchase and enjoy doing business through Amazon. Thanks!
2,Will NOT Ship as FRAGILE,"I ordered this set to complete my set because I have more children this Christmas. Amazon did NOT ship the set FRAGILE and all 4 mugs were broken; all 4 salad plates were shattered.I also ordered with Amazon Prime and they arrived a day late: one extra day to get knocked around somewhere. They arrived in a regular Amazon box with a bit of brown paper shoved in the bottom. Obviously, whomever packed the box didn't care they would arrive broken.I now know NOT to buy dishes from Amazon. Great price; great product. Poor shipping."
4,Seductive and Psychological Thriller,"From the first scene of the movie to the last I found myself reaching for the remote to keep searching for all of the information I could obtain about the Overton family. The acting was minimal but Hurt does a good job of persuading the audience to look beyond the acting skills and fall into the trance of Allison and the mystery surrounding Jody, their young daughter who was in a car accident 6 months prior to the movie.Through each room and each character the movie develops and becomes almost addictive. The profiles are almost scary they are so accurate.You must view this film at least once if not more!"
1,"Good Movie, Bad DVD - Giant Watermark Spoils Picture","There's a big, giant ""Moser Baer"" watermark that obstructs the upper, left-hand corner of the screen, and it never goes away. At times people look like they have ""Moser Baer"" digitally tattooed across their foreheads. If at all possible, find some other distributor for this movie. Don't buy this one unless you want to suffer hours of frustration."
5,Amazing.,"It is an amazing account of what God will do in a ""nobody's"" life when they will just let ""God be true"" and submit to Him.We are all incapable of doing God's work, but God will work through those that trust and obey. Very few people are willing to walk in humility instead of getting self-important."
1,Cheap and annoying,"The phone feels cheap, probably because it is. It looks pretty ugly, and, unless you're looking for something kitschy or you're a 12-year-old girl, the flashing LED lights don't help. I was unable to adjust the volume on the the handset, even when I followed the procedures in the manual. Pressing the volume +/- buttons just caused the handset to beep LOUDLY in your ear but failed to produce any discernable difference in the volume. Long story short, don't buy this. There must be something better, even at the low price."
1,Waste of money!!,"I purchased this phone recently and would not recommend it unless you like to see the ""dancing"" light display. Make sure that you have another phone close by to actually answer the phone because this phone is not usable. The volume is too low and if you adjust it upwards there is a terrible feedback noise. It is simply not worth your time or money!"
3,"Both massive, and not","The game is great, there's a lot of specialization involved with both your character and your gear, there's plenty of new content and updates that have added interesting new twists.However, its an older game. The populations are declining, so you won't find the same lvl of in-town fighting that you used to. To make up for this, there is the realm vs. realm combat, which throws massive numbers of players into a structured, seige-style combat environment. If you get in with a group that knows what its doing, it can be a lot of fun.Upside: There's plenty to choose from when specializing your character and the world has a lot of cool stuff to explore.Downside: If you are looking for smaller PvP battles (anything less than 20 people is small for this game) you aren't gonna find it here. (If you like really big fights, then you've got nothing to worry about).For the price, its definately worth checking out. The more recent additions have really spiced this game up."
1,"hard to use, high maintenance, expensive clunker","OK.. I am not a photo professional so probably the quality of the prints is top of the line.But for a regular guy who has to babysit one of these in a school lab I find it to be a source of constant frustration.It is very finicky with how to load different sizes of paper. It works slowly, it buzzes, clicks and whirs and generates lots of errors.It needs 8 different cartridges of very expensive ink (over $70 each, OEM) at all times. It's like having a very expensive spoiled princess of a wife who is never happy and needs to go buy more handbags and shoes.. and who needs that, not me : )"
5,"Good movie, good soundtrack","...I thought Eight Crazy Nights was great. It wasn't filled with potty humor, and the songs are pretty funny. My two favorite songs would definitely Bum Biddy and Long Ago."
1,Don't Bother,"How many remakes of the ""Chanukah Song"" do we have to endure! I never liked the song in the first place simply because it really isn't funny. I only saw the movie because it was so overly promoted that I anticipated it would be something great, which it was not. Were the producers in a hurry to get this out for Chanukah? The Christophopic overtones is outragious and it simply was not funny!"
5,Insane in the brain!!,"Anger the neighbors and make your mom's ears bleed. Pro-pain throw everything at this album. Pure rage, angst and energy. Although this band is one of the most underrated in their genre. They definitely hold the title of heaviest over cohorts such as Biohazard, Sepultura and Soulfly. THIS IS HEAVY STUFF!! For fans of the band, this is a must for the live tracks which truly showcase the bands stage presence. Those casual fans looking for a great compilation of the best, this is it. A can't miss all-round"
5,"Excellant Tool ""A must for the Handyman""","I use this tool for almost everything; at work, hunting, fishing and home. It is very easy to carry, either clipped to your belt or inside the pocket. Very well designed with a rugged endurance."
4,another great book,what more can I say I really like her books. I start and can't stop until I finish even if I am up half of the night.
2,"My introduction to Chalker -- No more, please.","This chaotic mess of a story will keep me away from his other works. Why?The main character is not engaging at all. At no point do I actually care about him/her. At no point can I sympathize, or even emphasize. There is no connection to any of the main characters, as they have the real depth of manniquins.The plot draaaaaaaaags.There is even an epilogue in which it felt like the author was trying to explain to the reader why the story was secretly interesting, even though you didn't know it while you are reading it.No more, please."
3,non responder,Placed the order and the seller did not respond to requests for information on the order.
3,Summary of Mummies,"In the book Mummies in the Morning, Jack and Annie travel to Egypt. Jack and Annie follow an Egyptian black cat into a pyramid. Inside the pyramid, Jack and Annie think they have encountered a tomb robber but instead it is an Egyptian Ghost Queen named Hutepi. Hutepi needs Jack and Annie to find her Book of the Dead. The book will help her go on to the ""Next Life"". Jack and Annie read tiny pictures carved into the stone walls of the pyramid called hieroglyphs. The hieroglyphs give them the clues they need. While Jack takes the scroll and puts it with the mummy of Hutepi, Annie takes off and gets separated from Jack. Once reunited, they cannot find their way out of the pyramid until the Egyptian black cat appears and shows them the way home."
3,mummies awaking,The magic tree house that jack and annie found has been there for a long time.This time Jack and Annie are on there third adventure and this time they have to go to egyption time.
3,Mummies in the Morning,"This book was an okay book! This book is about these kids named Annie and jack. Jack and Annie go to Egypt and in a pyramid. When they go inside the pyramid, Jack and Annie have to find the book of the dead. Now you will have to read the book to find out about the rest of the book."
1,It's unoriginal...just a remake of the Stargate soundtrack,"I have the original score from the movie and if anyone has it, then they'll realize that this is just snippets of the score. I love the show and the movie and have heard some of the tv program's music. It's good. So good, that instead of taking music from the movie, use the music that is being played in the background of the show therefore creating an all NEW score to the Stargate adventure. My suggestion: if one wants to make a score and a program based on an outstanding movie, do so...but please... be original."
4,An album worth listening to.,"After 2001's Yo Por Ti, Olga Tanon returns with this new album called ""Sobrevivir"" which features 6 ballads and 5 midtempo and uptempo songs. Overall the album is not better but just as good as Yo Por Ti. It features the lone merengue song ""Por Tu Amor"" which is one of my favorite songs on the album as well. One thing I did notice about the album is that Olga's voice sounds way better than in Yo Por Ti. Other notably worthy songs on this album are, ""Caramelo"", ""Beso A Beso"", ""Ojos Negros"", ""Asi Es La Vida"", ""Sobrevivir"" and ""A Partir De Hoy""."
5,Dynamic!,"In top voice and the songs are snappy. In the past she's had so-so material when singing ballads. Here, they are as strong as her voice. Best Cuts: Mentiras, Caramelo, Beso A Beso, Ojos Negros, No Podras and Sobrevivir. If you're just starting out with Olga, this is a non disappointer!"
1,Very bad CD,This CD is a very bad production. Don't waste you money in it. I recommend Histeriha from the puertorican Diva Celines.
4,More complex than monopoly and lot more tedious management.,"This game is a fun one to take out of the box every now and then. It required a lot of tedious management with money, and cards, and stickers, etc. Have fun setting it up, playing it and putting it away."
4,"Super fun... Love it, but needs electronic version!!","Bought and played game for the first time, as adults, the entire family loved the game!! Played it 2x's over a few days and that's a lot considering how long it takes. I would compare this to traditional monopoly to the degree of time and money transactions - if this game came out with the electronic version like the new monopoly and life games, I would give this game a 5 stars as that would help speed up the game, and make all the math easier to handle!"
4,Harvesting the Fun,"The Farming Game has become one of our families favorite games . My husband and I purchased it for something to do during a snowstorm , however we have played it with others and now they want to 'borrow ' it all the time . I had to tell them to get their own from Amazon.comThe length of the game is determined by the players so it can be a fast short game , or it can be played all afternoon , the choice is yours . I would recommend it for ages 10 and over ."
2,Kiss the Girls good bye,"The 2 stars I gave the soundtrack is for Mark Isham's score ONLY... NOT the songs. If you buy ""Kiss the Girls"" I gotta say "" you should have got Jerry Goldsimth"" because ""Along came a spider"" is much better. This album is appealing but the songs just don't fit the environment of the movie. Mark Isham's score is good, rich scary music,--BUT-- the songs just don't cut it! ... and sooo many key tracks are not on here!. Just try Along came a spider first and then get Kiss the Girls. It could have been good."
4,Kiss the Score,"Kiss the Girls is an Great addition to the collection of anysoundtrack fan. But the soundtrack is only about 32 min(score only). This CD is over all not as good as Along came a Spider.If you Start it at track 5 ""Kiss the Girls"" and you will say ""this is a cool soundtrack""...BUT if you start it at track 1 you will say ""what is this..."". what the heck were they thinking when they put four songs on the soundtrack. Keep up the good work Mark."
4,helpful for parents,"As a professional counselor, I was interested in specific ideas on helping parents & children of divorce. This book had some very concrete ideas. It is aimed at parents, written in 'plain-speak'. There's nothing new or eath-shaking here, but it is a pretty all-inclusive little book for parents interested in helping their children deal with the issue of divorce."
5,A Great Series,"I bought this item and ""John Adams"" at the same time. I watched ""John Adams"" first and thought it was good, but then I watched ""The Adams Chronicles"" and thought it was superior to ""John Adams"".I felt this film went more in-depth on the founding of our country and the work done by the Adams family to see that the country survived.I highly recommend this over ""John Adams"" and feel if you want the real story of four generations of Adams's this is the one to get. Forget the other."
5,The Adams Chronicles,"Back in 1976, in the midst of nonsense like ""Three's Company"", long before the excellent ""John Adams"" from HBO, PBS gave us this gift! Long unavailable in any format, now well restored on DVD, this series should be required viewing for all U.S. History classes, if they are to understand the true meaning of Patriotism."
5,A Merry Christmas Tribute to and from 007,"This is an outstanding book covering all 21 official James Bond movies. It is cocked full with many color and black & white photographs, storyboards, sketches and other related visual delights. It covers many aspects of the James Bond films from different angles. I like its objective approach making this book a tribute and a real acknowledgment of what has been accomplished in these 21 films. This attractive book will certainly make a truly great Christmas gift."
5,A Real Hidden Gem,"We All Fall Down has a hard earned wisdom to its lyrics which are matched with haunting chords, a combination that just makes you stop and listen. Think of a John Prine from New York City. Bair has that late night voice with a rocker's twinkle in his eye. The arrangements are never over the top but always in the pocket. ""Driving Down From Rockaway"" and ""Janey"" are my faves but there just isn't a miss in the bunch. Highly recommended."
1,This isn't A. A. Milne's Pooh!,"Those of you who love the origional Pooh bear with it's sweet songs and melancholy love, like in ""Pooh's Grand Adventure...,"" will be sorely disapointed, as I and my toddler where. This is strickly Disney, and not Walt. Don't purchase this as there are other Pooh DVD's worth your hard earned dollars."
2,Works OK - not perfect,Ordered as a replacement which broke. Cap fits but does not allow bumping as the original part did. Have to remove the cap pull the string out and then replace the cap.
1,Coaster City,"Out of 25 disks, I have had 10 burn properly. With a 2/5 success rate, these are great for making coasters, terrible as DVD media. I used three different computers, with three different burners, so this is not a machine or burner issue. Almost all the problems were in the second layer, and caused massive CRC errors with the data put on them. In short, they would have to sell for a quarter their present price to make up for wasted disks and time. As of now they are just overpriced junk."
1,I am currently 0 for 6 using these blanks.,"I have not burned one successful DVD using these blanks. I have even tried to slow the burn rate down to 1X with no luck. I know it is not my computer or software. I have successfully burned 5 out of 5 Verbatim dual layer discs (8X speed) trying to record the exact same information. I have never had this problem with any other media I have used. The error message I receive from my DVD player after what appears to be a sucessful burn is a ""dirty disc"" message. When I put it back in the computer, it can not be read at all."
1,Pure junk,The first one out of the pack was a coaster and will not play on either dvd player or on the dvd burner on my computer. Avoid this product.
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"Although a good read, not at all what I was expecting. Unfortunately, after seeing all the movies I'm reading these books for the first time with preconceived ideas of what they're about. I've been pleasantly surprised by all the books, which are tons better! But this one dragged a bit especially since Bond doesn't show up until at least half way through. Not my favorite but glad I read it."
5,Great new perspective,"This is one of my favorite Bond novels, because of the fresh perspective. I would not recommend it as your first Bond novel though."
1,Stay at home Mr B!,"I have read the works of many travel writers, but never have I found it a struggle to read one until now.What Mr Biddlecombe has missed, is the fact that great travel writers have to give of themselves. Whether the reason for there journey is emotional, nostalgic, challenging or the consequence of a drunken bet, it is only by us understanding their motivation, that puts their views and experiences into context.I was in this city at a conference and x, y & z happened in a bar, really does not engage the reader. I ended up not only not caring about why he was there, but also not caring about anything he had to say.If you want a great American travel book, try The Lost Continent by Bill Bryson, if you want a funny view of a Brit in America, read California Dreaming by Lawrence Donegan. Maybe Mr B should have read more like these before boring us rigid!"
4,"A good book, but maybe not that good as many here think.","It is a very good textbook for a person who is interested in studying logic. I don't want to repeat the good points of this book, which can be found in many other reviews. What I want to say is in the field of symbolic logic, this book is a little bit weak, compared to my favorite -- ""Introduction to Symbolic Logic"", by A. H. Basson & D. J. O'Connor, published by Unversity Tutorial Press Ltd in 1953. ..."
3,Space sampler,"3 1/2An ideal starting point into not only the ambient group's hazed methodology but, for better or a little worse, all the freedoms and constraints found within one such sonic perspective."
1,This is music??,"After receiving this Cd and subsequently listening to it, I cannot understand the reviews. Absent from tracks was any kind beat, melody, musical instrumentation or basic talent on behalf of the artist. I can get more cohesive music from listening to the fridge hum or my blender. I own far more CD's that most folks and play them through a five figure system. The label ""Kranky"" is a an appropriate name for how I felt after previewing this CD."
3,Not quite what I expected...,"Being an avid Bowie fan, I eventually stumbled across numerous reviews on Amazon praising this album for it's musical genius, making me quite excited when I found it for only [$$]. But, to be honest, I just couldn't find it's glory. Don't get me wrong, it's still alright, but there's easily nothing on here that I see as being worthy of the high praise other reviewers have shown. Coming from one of the best artists of the century, it just isn't up to par. The songs and instrumentals featured on here seem to be merely average. That said, there may be something wrong with me. If you're a huge Bowie fan, you might want to add this to your collection, but don't be too depressed if you can't find it. That said, I can't think of any other reason to really buy this unless you've heard it and know you like it."
1,Total Useless Garbage -- Went Out of Print for A Good Reason,"This is a tired ripoff of a book from 1988 that apparently went out of print, since this version is published by a firm called ""Backinprint.com"". It should have *stayed* out of print!A total waste of time in this day and age of upscale cookbooks from famous chefs and their Michelin-starred restaurants, with beautiful graphic design and photography to inspire your cooking. This one claims to be a guide to ""secret ingredients"", but it's just a bunch of ho-hum recipes instead. Not a single photo, all text, and printed on cheap paper. At a list of $19.95, it's clearly a ripoff, which prompted this 1-star review to balance the morons who gave it 5. Pass this by, you're not missing anything."
1,Too dense.,"Respectfully, this book tries to cover too many areas. Many of which is not purely Rehabilitation Medicine but actually other specialties. Gathering from this book I do not know the difference between a physiatist and physical therapist. It is not clearly not spelled out."
3,"A Good Read, but, Please, Don't Be Fooled!","This is a good book and all, and a great story, but it reall has nothing to do with anything magickal or occult. The Necronomicon was a creation of Howard Philips Lovecraft. He donned the name Abdul Al-Hazrad after reading ""Arabian Nights"". In fact the very name of the author of the Al Azif (The arabic original) is flawed. Abdul is not even a true Arabic name. The propper name should have been Abd Al'Azrad (The Worshiper of the Great Devourer/Strangler), though this could be attributed to a clerical error, it's still a ""nice"" conveinience for those looking to support this misassociated document. There is also proof in letters to several corespondances by Lovecraft himself, claiming authorship of the mystical book, and deeming it a work of fiction... I've yet to find a good version of a Necronomicon that seems factual to all it's word... But it's a good read nonetheless... Completely Fictional but a good read!"
4,I don't doubt the authenticity of this work.,"I am an avid Call of Cthulhu player and gamemaster and use it and the R'lyeh Text as reference materials...No one can say whether this is a definite hoax or not as not all that much is known of the practices of ancient Sumeria. There is some validity as far as the social commentary goes. The material is too bizarre and haunting to have been made up ""to make a quick buck"" as a friend of mine has put it. Anybody who is involved in Lovecraft's works should read this.CTHULHU FHTAGN!"
1,now i'm laughing,"My first review was written before I read all of the reviews here. Now I'm really laughing. Poor misguided loathsome creatures! All of those who read this and believed it should be put to sleep. It's a hoax!!! I especially liked the guy at the bottom who uses references from the book for incantations and spells. Then you have the guy above him who tells the truth about the book being made up. Poor, lost, pitiful creatures. Get a life!!! Lovecraft rules. Without a doubt. But don't link him to your devil worship and blood sacrifice ceremonies. If you want keys to the gates of hell and the lower planes, go see a locksmith...Leave Lovecraftian references alone. He was the greatest writer of supernatural horror and fiction. The key word being, ""Fiction"". Show him some respect..."
3,This Necronomicon is a hoax!,"Yes, this Necronomicon is a hoax. As written before, it can still be amusing reading, although it's not authenthic occult material. The Necronomicon edited by Simon is better even if it too may not be completely accurate. Like all old left-overs, it's hard to make a totally correct judgement of it's whole true meaning..."
2,It's sad such albums get 5*...,"The only reason for 2* instead of 1* is that there are plenty much worse bands out there. At least all of the band's members are accomplished musicians (I never liked Swano or Akerfeldt's other bands though, including much hyped Edge of Sanity).Anyway - monotonous music, songs indistiguishable from one another, simplistic and uninspired drumming, excessive (almost silly) guitar distortion and AWFUL processed vocals - what not to like about it? Oh, by the way - ""artwork"" looks like their label didn't want to pay for it, at all.It's such a shame people don't even want to know a little bit more about genre of which they consider themselves ""fans"". ANY album from Vomitory or Fleshcrawl is light years ahead of this childish crap. Amazing Swedish band Runemagick, which released 7 (!) excellent albums, is practically unknown here in US...Sad, sad, sad.P.S. By the way, their debut EP was better than this."
5,Mikael Akerfeldt ... delivered from the gods,"I'm beginning to realize that everything Mikael Akerfeldt is involved with, musically, is a masterpiece. I was always a huge Opeth fan, but now it's the only thing I can listen too, except for this new Bloodbath album. I bought it a week after I picked up deliverance and I must say... GET IT! if you like metal at all, you will love it. It's fast, heavy, and has some great groove. Mikael adds that perfect ""Demon Voice"" quality that we all know and love. It's One of the better Metal albums I've heard since Rust In Piece."
3,"Good burner, terrible software","The burner installed easily and works just fine - just not with the misearable MYCd software that came with it. All I got with that were buffer underruns and blue screens. The brains at HP suggested disabling all of my virtual device drivers, something that makes Windows very angry. I bought Click'n Burn, which works perfectly. With that I've never had a failed burn. It just seems that when you buy a CD writer, the first thing you do shouldn't have to be shop for new software."
2,misleading,"The title of this book makes you think it is full of nice, full page portraits. But it is just pages from Beard's scrapbooks, and it looks like a scrap book. Torn articles and photos are pasted down, with Beard's scrawls in the corners sometimes describing what the subjects are, sometimes not. He ruins a neat photo of Mick Jagger eating a giant lollipop on a boat by smearing red paint on the photo. Beard seems to think such paint smearing on his photos (that he does more than once) will give these photos a Jackson Pollock type of value. Afraid not. This book should have been titled ""Scrapbook."" Then those of us who wanted nice portraits wouldn't be disappointed, and those who wanted the ""wild"" experience of paging through a disorganized mess that is the product of a disorganized mind, would know where to go."
2,Music Listening Today by Charles Hoffer,I purchased the book for its listening guide to aid in interpreting a few songs for their key elements. I found the guides and text to be very vague and unhelpful. I was better off using the textbook I had originally purchased. This book is a waste of money even though the price was a wonderful bargain.
1,Took too long and never worked,I can't review the actual product because we have not been able to use it. It took about three weeks to get here and the product was defective. The manufacturer was not responsive at all. It has been five days since we asked for a new copy and we have not received it yet. I would not recommend this product or any other product from this manufacturer
2,Was not able to use,I was not able to use the product. Rear sight did not get much clearance above the receiver of my boy's stock Ruger 10/22. Otherwise the Fire Sights product picked up ambiant light great. I do wish I could have used it.
1,DO NOT BUY IT!,"nothing much to say about this sight. just by looking through and lining it up u know its poorly made. rear sight was crooked, i actually had to put it on so part of the dove tail was sticking out to make it look straight when lining it up. also breaks way to easy. i moved it and leaned it up against the wall to grab a few things, it slips and falls down and the front sight completely broke. i switched back to its factory iron sight which was already broken and i feel like id still be more comfortable getting dropped into a fire fight with a broken factory sight then getting a new one of those."
4,Excellent and enjoyable,An excellent book. Jones covers the subject matter in a very agreeable way. Easy to read with the kind of insight that only an insider has.
4,So far so good!!,"I have a Dell Inspiron 1545, it's gone through 2 hard drives already. I think the issue my laptop had with the previous 2 HD (250gb) was that it kept over heating and crashing. I use this HD as a daily beater for work and back up all my files online in the event that it crashes again.So far up till now i've had no issues. Works like a charm."
2,A compilation that misses the good songs...?,"I read one of the reviews already posted suggesting that if you're looking at this album you would be better served to buy the originals. That reviewer is 100% correct. Beyond Belief, Unseen Power, and Wake-Up Call are my three favorite Petra albums and this CD looks to be poorly cobbled together from them. Don't get me wrong, there are still some great songs on here, but if you buy this CD you'll be missing out on the truly great songs those albums had. Don't settle for left-overs. Get the original albums."
4,mixups,"We had a mixup with which game I got, but the seller was very easy to work with on trying to get me the correct one."
5,Just Amazing,"As a HUGE ut2k zealot, I have always loved the games. With the latest installment, they one-up the previous with the amazing vehicles. The new arenas are pure joy,, and the mods make it worth every penny."
2,Broke the first day we had it,"The watches worked ok and really fit what we needed it for, but the clasps broke the first day!! Now they just sit in a drawer, disappointing."
1,Not the correct Active Ingredients listed.,"The listed Active Ingredients in the product description are WRONG.The product I received contained (Active Ingredients):Avobenzone 1%Homosalate 5%Octinoxate 7.5%Octisalate 5%OXYBENZONE 6%Oxybenzone is considered questionable as to safety, especially for children."
3,the sun doesn't burn but the pads do,"The sunx towelettes did keep me from getting sunburned, although they caused my cheeks and chin to breakout. My skin can be a bit of a delicate snowflake, but my husband has skin like a rino-hide and he asked, ""are these supposed to burn?"" and his chin broke out almost immediately.They are very convenient, and did keep the sun from burning us, but I think I'll go back to my non-stinging lotion from the bottle."
1,Don't Buy For KIDS!,"I seldom reveiw products but these wipes were a huge let down. Convenient yes, effective NO. I used them on my three year old this weekend (two wipes on a 3 ft tall person) and she got sunburn on her legs, arms and face. She also cried when I applied to her face becaue the product has a heavy alcohol content and stings your face.Please please use a more child friendly product and steer away from this for anything other than shoulders and limbs on adults!"
4,Easy to use,There are 25 towelettes in the box. That wasn't clear on the information.These are easy to use sunscreen and easy to carry.
1,Junk,"Another poor performer from our friends (?) at HP. This annoying little beauty worked ok for about two months, but now freezes up every time I try to burn a CD. Re-installing software doesn't help, nor does talking to HP (and they charge for customer support calls!). Avoid this junk."
1,DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU ARE USING DELL C600 LATITUDE,"I spent about 6 hours to get this thing working. Repeatedly contacted HP customer service, and was mislead to downloading the wrong software from Dell's website, then was referred to Dell for help. Spent another two hours re-booting and adjusting the BIOS, and still it didn't work.. The USB support software is incompatible with my machine. If you own Dell do yourself a favour and buy something else."
4,"Got it today, three cds already burned","I got the burner today and within an hour of opening it I had successfuly completed burning 3 cds. I don't know much about computers, but this was very easy and self explanatory. Each Cd took about 10 minutes to burn and I've listened to parts of all three of them-they sound great! I would definitely reccomend this to any propspective buyers who don't know much about computers but want to convert all of their mp3 files to cds. It's easy to use, and as far as I can tell works great!"
1,Does not work for me either.,Like most of the reviews this thing has not worked for me. I will try getting some new software.
3,Every machine has a few kinks,I purchased my CD-writer about a couple of months ago and it was nice and easy to set up. I really didnt have any problems with that. But once i got started and ready to burn not all my songs showed up and weren't ready for burning. I had to take a lot of my mp3's and convert them to wave and that was quite annoying. And i can't even convert songs that i got from other cd's and put on my computer. So i mean all the songs i can burn are the ones i downloaded and then converted. I mean other than that the writer works well and i've had no other problems. I think it's been a good investment.
1,compatibility nightmare,"i purchased this product to work with my dell latitude laptop which has windows 2000 loaded on it. i could not get the unit installed correctly - it just didn't work. finally after a half a day talking with hp customer service, i was informed that there was a compatibility problem with this unit and windows 2000. they are writing a fix for it, which should be done in 2 months.they also said that there was a compatibility issue with dell latitude laptops.i guess this was not my lucky day for buying. returned the hp and am buying another brand."
2,GREAT PRICE But Shabby product,"Looks good, but the fact is it poor in measurement as it pretty much shows the measurement in boolean values i.e. says it's good or bad.The unit is very poor in determining intermediate values in batteries. (and sometimes show almost dead batteries also as if it has 60% power left).This is just ok to determine wheather the battery ok or needs to be thrown, anythig beyond it don't expect."
3,Multiplications,This product was ok but it didn't work very well for my grand daughter. It didn't keep her interest and even though it said it was for age group either it was a little too slow for her or she was a little too advance for it. I tried it myself and was bored. I wouldn't purchase it again for a nine year old.
3,Interesting,This little recipe booklet is informative and attractive. The recipes are a collection of a full spectrum of Danish delicasies. Format is convenient. It's like a collection of 3 x 5 recipe cards. I am afraid to put it in the bookcase for fear I'll loose it!
5,"Awesome! ,Superb!, and highly Spiritual!","Jeff is truly a God-gifted musician. All of God's glory comes through in the music on this CD. The music is both up-lifting and inspirational. If you haven't ever felt the Holy Spirit, you will once you turn this CD on. He is truly annointed -- so is his music. Praise be to God!!!"
5,Sacred- Featuring the 23 Psalm,"This is the best and most spiritual recording I have heard.When I first heard it in church, I had to have it. I pray thatGod's annointing continue to touch Mr. Jeff Majors and his music team. The music is so inspirational. I am going to purchase copies to share with family and friends during this Christmas Holiday season. It is the perfect gift.FromV Wallace"
2,Green flossers not so good,The green flossers arent good for tight teeth. Tight or close teeth need the waxed flosser -the white ones.
3,nothing under or over 436,"Steve Kady works for the Census Bureau. And for some reason, he has to head out from Chicago to a small town of Rockwell Falls to count heads. There seems to be a discrepancy.Rockwell Falls looks like any other normal small country town. However, Kady starts to pick up odd things about the town. One major odd thing that catches his attention is that the population has remained 436 for the last century.And the strangest thing of it all is that he is one of the 436. Therefore, he cannot leave town. Of course, this only motivates Kady to leave town. Does he? Or will he accept his fate and become a resident?I thought the movie was good with the plot being fairly simple. Definitely better than *2001 Maniacs*. Watch this film but don't expect to be impressed."
3,Solid rock-n-roll,"Sure, these guys are classic but I can't understand why some people seem to be falling over themselves trying to praise this band. Overall, this is a solid rock-n-roll album but nothing to get over;y worked up about. Yes, I know that Motorhead paved the way for the NWOBHM but that doesn't change the fact that this album is only pretty good.Not bad but not necessarily recommended."
3,Motoreads most overrated album,"Middle of the pack Motorhead. Yes, it has their big hit ( and one which some seem to assume that was Motorheads only song) the title track, but come on, take a reality check. Fire, Fire, Dance, Bite The Bullet and a few others (that I can't even recall the name of!) are highly forgettable filler And the sound quality isn't great either. There's some good guitar solos here and there, but over all I prefer the more recent incarnations of Motorhead with good old Phil Campbell. 1916, Hammered and Inferno are all better albums , and better recorded, in my opinion. If you're new to Motorhead, I suggest those albums, not this one. Your choice though."
5,the best motorhead album,ace of spades was the greatest album from lemmy kilminister and his boys.this album is a great hard rock classic with superb songs like shoot you in the back and live to win.very highly recommended.[...]
5,LEMMY'S CLASSIC!,"Of all the many albuns Motorhead record, Ace of Spades is the classic! The song Ace of Spades is one of the most famous musics in the world! All the songs are good, some are from the best Motorhead ever recorded like THE CHASE IS BETTER THAN THE CATCH, THE HAMMER and LOVE ME LIKE A REPTILE. LEMMY IS TRULY A LEGEND! and ACE OF SPADES is his most famous record."
3,Buyer Beware! Album not by the artist you might be expecting,"This album is by some POP/Rock band called 'Orb'. It *is not* a Dr. Alex Patterson ""Orb"" album (following up the likes of Orbus Terrarum and Cydonia), as I thought it would be when I ordered it. Disappointed. I spun it up, cycled through a few tracks, and put it away forever...I gave the album 3 stars because I didn't want to be terribly unfair to an album that I haven't *really* listened to, that's of a genre I don't particularly care for..."
1,"Not The Orb You Think, and Not That Good Regardless","I will not be as kind as the other guy who gave the benefit of the doubt when reviewing this album. If you put out an album in 2002 without checking first to see that there's already an internationally popular electronic band with the same name (only difference: ""The"") then you reap what you sow. (Although, it serves me right for buying a new album from an artist I like without previewing.)Regardless, even pretending that The Orb does not exist, this is a purely mediocre folksy-rock album with nothing that stands out as very good. Don't bother, and don't support sloppy artists who don't do their research before releasing."
3,Orb-In My Mind,"OrbRockIn My MindJumping back to the 1970's Orb's album In My Mindis a bit of a rock folksy CD. I enjoyed the acoustic arrangement very much. With songs such as the random thought song In My Mindand a beautifully written love song, Ophelia (from Hamlet) anyone who appreciates old school rock with a new attitude will enjoy this CD. This album recieves the rating of a 3. It doesn't make my mind run. I didn't think about the words so much as to how they made me feel. Other than the interest factor this album was pretty good. I liked the production and arrangements."
5,Great Burner and Software Package,"This is a great cd burner. It has fast burns (8-12 minutes) and the software is great, it allows you to download new songs and put songs from cds into your music library. It also has a radio feature which is really nice. This is a great burner with great software at a great price."
3,Works well but not well built,"We use ours in our finch room. These little birds can create quite a smell and this model did WONDERS to clear that up. They also seemed healthier and I suspect that the UV light had something to do with that. After about 6 months we started to get fan squeak at lower speeds and this gradually got worse over the next 12 months at which time the motor just died. I couldn't find my receipt so I threw it out. Admittedly I found a great deal on one on clearance at Canadian Tire and bought another one. I'm hoping the first one was a fluke.UPDATE - much later. The second unit lasted a few months and burned out too. This unit is discontinued and I can't say I'm surprised. If you find one around, even on a great sale, just leave it there."
4,sciatic releif,I was skeptical to try another back product but true back has helped to releive my back pain. When i use the product i get a better nights sleep drug free.
4,Vibrating True Back,"The True Back appears to be a relatively simple device and I was a bit sceptical, but I have found some relief using it. At first, it was quite uncomfortable to lie on, but with some perserverance, this improved every time I used the True Back. After using it, I felt that my spine/back had been stretched- I actually felt a bit taller because I was standing with better posture. The vibrating mechanism has been used only a few times as I find it too loud. I have not used the device without the foam inserts yet, but intend to do so in the next few weeks. I was disappointed that the free comfort pillow was not included with the package as advertised, as you definitely need something to support the head to make it more comfortable, especially to begin with. Don't expect miracles, but you will get some relief if you keep using the True Back and not give up too soon."
1,Santo Pecado,"Yo soy fanatica de Ricardo Arjona, pero estoy super decepcionada con el cd, lo escuche una vez y hasta me deprimi, Todas las canciones tienen que ver con lo mismo:que te fuiste, me abandonaste,lo mismo,lo mismo y mas de lo mismo. ""Galeria Caribe"" sin embargo fue excelente. Que paso esta vez??"
5,Quieres saber en qué pensaba Arjona al escribir este cd?,"Por qué preguntan eso cuando es obvio que era por todo del divorcio él?Bueno, no me gustaba Ricardo Arjona cuando lo escuché por primera vez. No sé porque. Pero al sentarme y ESCUCHAR de verdad, me quedé asombrado como maneja las palabras este hombre. Y, después de verlo en la TV en Otro Rollo, el loco de Adal Ramones le puso unas palabras y frases tontas (como 'besar' , 'veruga', 'cola' 'vaca' etc), Arjona compuso una cancion BONITA instantaneamente usandolas a TODAS las palabras. Eso para mi es la señal de alguien dotado. Me convenciste a mi Ricardo, bien hecho."
3,Not bad,"I bought this DVD for my wife after she had obtained another DVD by the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir. She felt the other DVD was better, not sure of the title. The other DVD was moving apparently."
5,Thank you!,I was glad to have found this series and even more glad of the opertunity to have the time with my daugher as she reads them to me again and again!
5,Fantastic!,Absolutely brilliant! This set looks great and sounds even better. Hear Elvis' first electric performances on the T.V. And then listen to his awesome power as he rips it up live at the 'Mississippi Alabama Fair' in front of his hometown fans. This is Elvis in his prime and at his best. Enjoy...
5,Helps with the cat's piano lesson,This video gives a brief tutorial on cats for any newcomers and shows Da Bird being used to encourage the cats on the piano[...]
5,Excellent!,This has been one of the best cat toy purchases we've made. Our cats love chasing this toy and we've been very pleased with the way it has held up to their abuse. Very happy (and tired) cats in this house! I would absolutely purchase this again and highly recommend this item.
1,"Product sent not as advertised, missing attachments","I received the pole and feather attachment, along with two feather refills. The sparkly attachment, kitty puff attachment, and peacock feather were no where to be found. I contacted the seller through Amazon and received an automated response that they were looking into it, but have heard absolutely nothing since then. It has been a few weeks so I have contacted seller again. Very disappointing, as the only reason I purchased this package was for the additional attachments. I suppose they could have sent a different package by accident, but it sure seems like a bait and switch tactic given that other buyers were missing items as well. Having one extra feather refill does not make up for the missing items. If they weren't available, I should have been notified in advance and given the opportunity to cancel my order. If the seller makes it right, I'll revise my review, but I'm not hopeful."
1,Did not like it,This HEPA filter puts out air which smells funny and exacerbates my asthma. I do not recommend it. My Honeywell works much better.
4,Gets the job done...,"Over the years, I've owned several air purifiers and I have to say that this one has been the best purchase yet. It's a larger unit, but is very sleek in it's design. I especially like the Germicidal Light. It also has a ""Quick Clean"" setting, as well as ""Silent"" settings. Another nice added feature is the display bar showing the quality of the filter inside."
2,Doesn't kill molds and viruses,"I bought one of these for my bedroom to test to see if it can remove viruses and molds from the air. I also bought an ""Indoor Air Quality Test Kit"". Three days later, the petri dish that was exposed to air for 1 hour was covered with ""stuff"" even though I had been running this Hamiltion Beach UV system in my foom 24/7 for 1 week. (250 sq ft room). My conculsion, the UV lamp is too small to do anything. I contacted HB and asked for info on their virus and mold killing tests and have not heard back for over 1 month now, hence this review. In my opinion, saying it kills viruses and molds is false advertising. It doesn't!"
5,Great *little* HEPA!,"I really like this cute little HEPA cleaner, but I should warn you that it is much smaller than I thought it would be. I also have a Honeywell and Kenmore HEPA units that are much larger and move a lot more air. However, for a small room, the Hamilton Beach unit provides quiet, efficient air cleaning in a compact unit. The Germicidal light is a nice touch."
5,Great for the money,"I highly reccommend this and for the money...it is a real find. Good HEPA cleaner with mutiple settings, from quiet to high power, easy to read display, good looking....an all around winner."
5,Worth Every Cent for the past 6 years!,"I bought this air purifier in 2003 and have ran it 24 hours a day and never had a problem! I have horrible allergies and coincidental adopted a Persian cat with worse ones! This purifier keeps us both happy and healthy. It is completely affordable and works perfectly! The whisper mode is very quite, thus you never notice it is running. The filter is easy to change and has sensors to tell you when a change is needed. Also it is super easy to clean and move around. Also I have never had to change the UV bulb, what more could you ask for? I have found no flaws with this product. I highly recommend it!"
3,Reads like a movie,"As much as I've come to dislike Warren Ellis's work, this volume wasn't that bad.It certainly reads like an Alien movie, and has a dark and eerie atmosphere that stays true to the films. Unfortunately, a lot of key characters were taken out ""off-screen,"" which leaves the audience hanging.The Bendix situation was a little open-ended, but I'm going to assume that'll be resolved in the post-Millar Authority."
1,"JUNK, DO NOT BUY",1 month of ownership and the unit dies. Estimated repair was 9 days. On the 8th day tech calls to state the replacement part was rerouted and therefore wont be repaired until 12 after my initial complaint. Sounds like they are having problems keeping replacement parts in stock. Getting any sympathy from this company is a waste of time. Buy from a trusted name in plasma televisions and spend the extra $ elsewhere
5,LOFL,"I LOVE P.G. Wodehouse, despite his bizarre activities during WW II, and this novel is probably the funniest of his I've ever read, including all of Bertie and Jeeves. One is simply laughing hysterically from beginning to end!"
3,insight into a strong woman,"This was an enjoyable autobiography of a strong woman living a hard life in the outback of Australia. Even though I didn't know much about her going in, I came out with respect and a desire to know more about her. An interesting woman who can tell a good story."
3,longarm extension pole,"The length was fine, but it required rewinding every few minutes because it doesn't lock tight no matter how tight you twisted it."
3,Playbacks only,"The arrangements are lovely on this cd, but it is playbacks not karaoke. There are no words, nothing for the karaoke screen."
4,good stuff,"i think this cd is like the bombs!!! i is such a good vibe man, like she says her beats r so addictive, I love her cd and everyone she icludes in it as well i recomend everyone who likes R&B and rap to buy this cd. It's just so different from all other songs, u know like the songs u hear on the radio all the time and they all sound the same, but hers man it's just different stuff it's a new freakin' world so ""Get ur Freak On""!!!!"
3,Expected More,"I bought this toy for my preschool class. Right off the bat, we were shorted a piece that was used to insert inside another piece in order to snug up a screw. We had to improvise. Tried it out. The cars would not stay upright on the ramp. They would turn over on their side and slide down until they stopped. Took to school to try out with different cars. Finally found that matchbox cars worked. First day, a piece that was assembled at the factory came unglued. Noticed on day 3 that the paint was chipping off in the same spot on every layer of ramp. I was jealous when my collegue had more luck with a plastic racing ramp that she bought at WalMart. I would not recommend this toy."
2,Beware,"It's big and expensive, and it only comes with 2 cars. One of ours broke within a couple months. AND IT DOESN'T WORK WITH ANY OTHER M&D WOOD CARS!!!! One reviewer said it works with Matchbox?!? But it doesn't work with the ones we have. And it doesn't work with Cars movie cars. Two replacement cars are $8, and you have to send a check directly to M&D. A big hassle--not to mention, an added expense. I was a big fan of M&D products, until this. Not a great experience overall, from product to service. I also question whether M&D are going downhill (no pun intended). Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have wasted my money."
3,Sitting idle,I thought this toy looked pretty cool so I bought it for my two year old son. It goes together quickly enough but has no lasting interest. The cars that come with it are easily lost and other cars don't really work properly with it. I payed fifty eight dollars which was way too much.
1,Poor quality for Melissa & Doug,"While the ramp racer looks great, I have to agree with many of the previous reviewers....it is not up to the standards of a Melissa & Doug product. It was difficult to put together, taking my husband and I over two hours because the screw holes were not properly lined up. One of the cars kept flipping on its side so it could not go down the ramp. The car release level on one side broke almost immediately (and this is with my husband trying it out -- before the grandchildren played with it). This would only be a good toy for a display item as it looks great....as a toy that a child would actually use, it is very poor quality. I would not recommend it."
3,Moody,"This album is a moody album, not a lot of arrangement. Just Will playing guitar with an occasional background voice.It's a great album, but not his best. If I hadn't reviewed BPB CD's before I would have given it 4 Stars, but compared to ""I See A Darkness"" and everything he recorded under the name of Palace and it's derivitives."
3,Not so beautiful,"I am confused about this book! I read ""The Essential Rumi"", Translations by Coleman Barks (New Expanded Edition) with such relish, I grieved when the book ended, and started reading it again from page 1 (see my review of this book). Wanting even more of Coleman Barks' ""Rumi"", I ordered this ""The Soul of Rumi"".I don't understand why the two books are so different in tone and rhythm! It's almost as though each book has a different translator/poet. In this ""Soul"" book, Barks seems to have lost his song. I just can't hear the rhythm. He breaks up all the verses into segments of monotonous two-line-one-space text that seem to trip and stumble. I can't get into this book. What happened to the music? What a great disappointment from ""The Essential Rumi"". Maybe it's just me, wrong to expect the same brilliance from the same translator/poet."
3,POWERFUL ENDING RUINED....,"I haven't seen this movie in about 20 years. I know that I really liked the movie but what always stands out in my mind was the Kansas song at the end and how fitting it was. Everytime I hear that song, Heroes comes to mind. I just bought the video and I'm going to just have to play the CD over the ending and mute the TV hahaha...."
2,You don't get what's pictured!,"I recently ordered this package thinking it would have everything I needed to start using my PSP. When i received it, thwere was no docking station. I cantacted the seller and they very politely pointed out that it did not say anything in the description about a docking station. Ok fair enough, i undertsand. But if you are going to sell something and place a picture of it on the site you should get what is pictured, not what is in some description in the middle of the page. That would be like me going to the Honda dealership looking at all of the civics, test driving their demo model, then buying one and getting it home and finding out there is a Hyundaii motor in there."
5,Pue Luck is hilarious!,If you like slapstick humor then Pure Luck is the movie for you. I laughed a thousand times the first time I saw it and it is just as funny after watching it multiple times. Martin Short was made for this character. :)
4,Not too bad!,"This book wasn't quite what I expected it to be, but there is still some really good info in it. Definitely a good place to get started learning about where Fender amps came from!"
4,VERY Good purifier - not quite enough for the bedroom,This is a very good purifier. I love the automatic sensor feature and it really works. For example - I live in a 1 BDRM appartment and when the dishwasher is working in the kitchen - there was this smell from the chlorin in the living room. The purifier picked it up right away and increased the fan speed automatically and then reduced to the lower level again when the smell dissapeared.On the down side - even on the lowest fan speed (they call it Whisper Clean) it is MUCH more then a whisper. You will have to get used to having a sound equivalent to a medium speed fan in your bedroom.
1,Pretty Disappointed,"So you are in the woods, looking for Sasquatch, filming as you go along, and the first night you hear mysterious sounds below you in a gulch. Do you.A. Not have any of the wonderful gadgets out of the case ready to use?B. Stare into the darkness while listening to the knocking of your Videographers knees?C. Say you have a ""vibe"" and then listen to the sound again?D All of the above?Notice none of the options was to be prepared and do some type of scientific study during this time.The folks are nice enough, but just when I thought this might get good, they ended it.All in all I can't for the life of me see what ANYONE would see in this item that would warrent a positive review.Buyers beware."
1,I guess he had better things to do!,"OK...I believe that a small meaningful gift at the holidays is better than a great big meaningless one...but this is ridiculous!!...This CD contains only 27 MINUTES OF MUSIC!!!...Its been quite a while since I've felt this ripped off. Look, I like Barry Manilow and his last Xmas album, is in heavy rotation at my house around the holidays, but this Christmas Gift of Love is contemptable. What little bit of music is here is good, but it hardly seems worth it. Oh, and I would have give it more stars, but I have better things to do."
1,Won't write to high speed media.,"I ordered this machine for my daughter with great expectations of burning a bizillion audio CD's over Christmas. No such luck.For starters, the software caused a fatal exception fault when I tried to load it on my Gateway 2000. Finally got it installed after 3 uninstall/install attempts. Then the (...) thing wouldn't write to the high speed HP CD-R provided with the component by HP. You'd think that the company would know what I ultimately found out - it will only write to 1x - 8x media. Try to find those in bulk quantity. The HP REcord Now program was also very slow when I tried to burn a music mix from 4 separate CD's, although I never got it to write to any CD-R.I fought my through the Troubleshooting Guide and finally got an autoreply from the ""24/7"" customer service department. (...)Good riddance."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF [JUNK],"I bought this way back in November and for a few months i was very happy with it, MyCD was actually working like a charm. Then back in March, the problems starting arising with writing errors constantly occuring, turning my potential music CDs into cup coasters. Tech support...tips havent helped one bit, and now a days its...impossible to find a 74 min CD-R disc to record with, which is what i need to successfully burn music onto my CDs. I really want to take this ...back to wherever it came from and buy a much better burner. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS...!"
1,Worse than AM radio,"I collect DVD-A and SACD discs because the sound is amazing. This DVD-A sounds worse than my local AM radio stations. I was hoping to hear my favorite songs from BOC Burning For You and Don't Fear the Reaper in high resolution but was very disappointed. The only good thing about this disc is that there is a small speaker calibration utility with a woman's voice that sounds high resolution. If like good quality audio, please don't buy this disc, you will be wasting your money."
1,Bad-Software Buyer Be Aware,I downloaded and installed the trail-version of this product... first it will not remove any-thing unless you buy...then I went online to read about it --CNET / download . com --- wooowww. bad reputation. It was really not easy to remove it from my computer and it made my computer very slow. don't it. stay away. I can't believe I actualy installed this peace of junk into my computer.
3,Good product but did too much.,"Tech. support was awesome, but had to remove program, have a lot of software programs and Stopzilla interfered with their execution. Regrettable but true."
3,Pretty Good...,"As far as medievals go, this one was better than most I've read lately. However,I still found it lacking to a degree. Maybe because I have read so many romances my perspective has become jaded - I'm sick of the old romance plot devices and silly writing styles. For example, how believeable is it that a chaste maiden turns instantly into majorly uninhibited sex goddess? Another quibble: At one point Simon has not slept for 3 days and still manages to get all horny when he sees Kaily. Would anyone who is that dead on their feet, no matter how attracted they are to someone, be thinking about sex at that time? I seriously doubt it. Just as I seriously doubt that 2 people would really fall in love - deeply - in only 3 days. I just wish romance writers would credit readers with a little more intelligence. Just because we like romance doesn't mean we also don't need an intelligent story to go with it."
4,Interesting book....,"I am class A USCF (around 1900) chess player who is usually crushed by Fritz. Yesterday, I picked this book up in a bookstore and looked at it for about 30 minutes. I found it quite interesting.Today, the first game I played with Fritz 6 ended in a crushing 25 move defeat for the Silicon giant. I am running a very fast computer with a gig of RAM.

2,"Noisy, dirty","I bought this humidifier a couple of years ago. For the first season, it worked pretty well. Increasingly, however, it has become noisier and noisier. One possible reason is the design: by drawing air through the fan blades, it accumulates dirt and dust in the fan mechanism, which can't be cleaned. Replacing filters is a regular expense - figure out the total cost of ownership before you buy. You may be surprised."
5,How can we get the 3rd through 5th seasons?,"How can we go about purchasing seasons 3 through 5? I've gotten the first and second seasons of FAMILY on DVD, and now how do we get the rest?"
5,Grand Slam,I remember watching this show on ABC when it originally aired in the late 70's. It was the high light of the week for me and now I am excited to finally have it on DVD. I hope the other seasons are released as well. This show was is and will always be a grand slam.
5,It doesn't get any better than this,"This was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid. When I found the DVD I was ecstatic. This show was so ahead of it's time that it is still relevant today. The writing, the cast, the guest stars (who are almost all recognizable) are just brilliant. I don't remember the show being funny back then, but now I laugh out loud fairly often. I'm amazed at Sada Thompson's subtle and dry wit. How lovable Kristy McNichol's Buddy is. How beautiful John Rubenstein's theme music is. Every episode is a gem, and I really hope that they release the other seasons. This is one of the best family drama series of all time."
5,Wonderful...,"I am so enjoying watching the DVD of Family. It's wonderful to watch something that is quality and not just another reality show. Not only are the episodes interesting, they are calming and a great way to end the day. Watching makes me feel very nostalgic. I would love it if more episodes came out on DVD."
2,Lots of Holes in This Plot,"I bought this book because I was looking for a new author and the reviewers seemed to be impressed. I must say that I was disappointed. The plot is full of some fairly serious holes, there was way too much discussion of coffee, and the correct spelling of ""losing"" is with one ""o."" Seriously, the story was OK but I hope Shadow Laws will be better. I'm only into the first 50 pages but it seems like more of the same."
1,Appalling,"Not to belabor the point, this is the fourth worst book I have ever read in some 45 years of reading a book a day. _No_ other book has had the distinction of having either a falsehood, greater or lesser, or an negatively emotionally charged irrelevancy on _every_single_page_. It is simply disgusting. Without merit. Foolish beyind compare. Vile and execrable. Trash of the purest kind. I would award negative stars were that possible.Save your money."
1,LOL LOL LOL How big was that fish?,"A very tall tale, that speaks to all the conspiracy buff's in the world. People love this stuff the same way they love scary campfire stories and UFO's. It is good page turner but should definitely go in the historical fiction section of your home library. Personally, I sold mine to a used book dealer after I read it."

4,Disney's MASTERPIECE 101 Dalmations,"Disney's 17th animated film 101 Dalmations is a hilarious comedy about a dog who wants a mate & wants his owner,Roger to have a wife & destiny strikes Pongo(the dog),sees another attractive dalmation with a very attrctrive owner & its fate they meet in the park & end up being wed.I can't tell anymore what happens after that would give the movie away.Buy this movie!Its a film the whole family will enjoy!"
4,AWESOME BUY!!!!,"I purchased 101 Dalmatians DVD and was very pleased with the service,the shipping and the price was GREAT!!! Definitely worth buying from Amazon!101 Dalmatians (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)"
3,101 Dalmations Blu ray.,"My grandchildren have not received it yet. When they do, I will ask my daughter how they liked it. I hope they do."
1,Bad library copy,We received a bad library copy. It skips and freezes. Just to get the disk to play we have to skip to the third scene. The extras disk doesn't work at all. What a waste of money.
3,Disk Skips and stops,"DVD skips and stops...I thought this disc was ""like new"" and it is NOT. Before I purchased, I would have appreciated being told that there were such glitches in the play-back quality. I guess I could have guessed that this wasn't good quality because of the lower price...soooooooo caveat emptor."
1,Worthless,Just plain awful. I didn't expect repairs to be explained in exhaustive detail...but at least with SOME detail. Pretty much just provides high-level overviews which would apply to any vehicle.
1,My opinion: Scent not meant for animals!,"The scent resembles that of oranges..... who wants their dog to smell like oranges?! I bought thirds bc they used to have a scent called stud muffin which was a nice Cologne-ish scent! Oh how I was disappointed to realize that it wasn't the same scent, none the less to find out it smelled like oranges which i'm not a fan of. It will be tossed in the garbage :( I ordered this and LOVE for the first time i've my STUD MUFFIN spray by them ran out. LOVE just smells like baby powder which I find unoriginal but at least it is tolerable!"
4,2 albums on one disc with a dance mix twist,"This LP is a combination of the first 2 Fun Factory LPs with a small difference in that each song blends in to make an everlasting club feel. This LP also features 2 mixes heard nowhere else: ""Doh Wah Diddy"" and a version of ""Pain"" which has alternate vocals instead of rap. If you have the first 2 LPs, that is cool but if you want a continuous dance party without having to switch CDs - including mixes that are not on the other Fun Factory LPs - I would encourage you to buy the album. You will not be disappointed. This LP also includes a megamix of Fun Factory favorites exclusively made for this CD."
2,"An ""ok"" rating","I would give this an ""ok"" rating. Its has and does the basics, but it does not record low volume levels, or quiet background sounds which is very disappointing to me. Also, its made in China, so i expect it to not work soon. When playing back you have to crank up the volume all the way to hear.Its not really what i wanted."
3,Too noisy,"The humidifier works well, but a bit noisy, not for small space. In small bedroom can create a headache."
1,Well the mouse just skedaddled across my living room,"... I've had the devices operational for about two weeks now and hadn't seen anything, so was quite happy, thinking my Mickey problem was solved.Then as I was, just now, leaving my kitchen, the little bugger just bolted under my bookshelves.*sigh*I over-bought the product too so that every room has two of them facing in opposite directions as recommended for bouncing the sonic sound off the walls.Apparently this product does NOT work on mice... at all.What a waste of money."
3,Would like to update my earlier review,"I said last year that this product worked great on ants. I had exhausted all other means of combatting the ants, and this product finally did it. Well..., it might have been a coincidence. One of the last measures that I took might have had a delayed effect, because this summer the ants came back and ignored the ultrasonic repellers!Either they don't work on ants, or they have a lifespan of less than a year. ;-)"
1,This product is a waste of money,"We purchased many units, plugged them in all over the house, and they have been totally ineffective! We still have mice and insects. As a matter of fact, spiders have used it to anchor cobwebs!"
4,Great cd for classic OMG fans,"This cd features two main songs from the oldest season ""My Heart, Your Heart"" and ""Congratulations."" The majority of the rest of the songs are filler from the season but nonetheless great to listen to. I paid around $8 for this on amazon at one point, if prices rise too high, try ebay, they often have sellers offering it for less."
4,Perplexing.,"This is the first version of the Fortune Faded single (released with red writing, instead of blue). The song can be heard, otherwise, on the RHCP Greatest Hits assemblage and Live In Hyde Park (for a live interpretation).The song itself is a strange little number that is fairly funky, but mostly melodious. The lyrics are what really catches you, though, as it tells a tale of insightful anecdotes and interesting events. This would have to be up there in the best unreleased tracks.The b-sides for this version are really well worth the digging-up. ""Eskimo"" is an inexplicable song that sounds superb. Pure bliss, if I do say so myself. The memorable chorus has many different things going on at once, which really set this song apart from most. A genuine jewel.""Bunker Hill"" isn't half bad either, but when you compare it to the greatness of ""Eskimo"", it simply can not live up. It, unfortunately, leaves you with an empty felling--unsatisfied.Positively Recommended."
4,Good stuff,"I have been craving egg nog this Christmas season but the calories are so high. I ordered this product to try. I mixed an 8 ounce batch (8 oz water, 1/3 cup powder). It wasn't thick, and tho tasted fine, it didn't taste like egg nog (more like vanilla). THEN, I put it in the fridge overnight! It thickened up and now tastes like egg nog! So---you must give this stuff time to set in the fridge. Also, be aware the 80 cal serving is 4 ounces (not 8) Still a lot less than regular egg nog but be aware. Tastes surprisingly good for a powdered mix!"
3,Not a proper album,"It has been some time since FODM released their last collection of songs so I was excited to hear of a new album. I was disappointed however to learn that the first disc of this double-disc collection had been released as an import over a year ago; a collection I already own. That being said, sonically there is not much new here. The second disc contains the signature FODM sound full of southwestern desert moods and spacey themes (all instrumental as usual). At times just superfluous sonic mush, the songs still manage to evoke some beautiful feelings. All in all this is a solid collection of songs, although I would have liked a proper studio album. That being said, those who have not heard the songs on disc 1 are in for a treat with the gorgeous versions of ""Wichita Lineman"" and ""Tennessee Waltz"". This collection of FODM songs is better than none at all."
3,Strange,"Kind of a ""King Crimson"", trippy feel. Timothy Leary would have loved this stuff!Definetly different but I liked it; musicians are definetly skilled."
2,Wellman complicates civic history lesson.,"'Missouri' feels more like a civic lecture than a film; it tries the impossible task of celebrating the American frontier spirit with a newly tolerant approach to Native Americans, who are kindly allowed do more than whoop menacingly. Well some are; this Western is only liberal to those Natives who agree to the white subjugation of their land - those who refuse are murderous, anti-family transgressors.That's what the script says, and the cheerful narration and dazzlingly bright colours seem to confirm it. Us old Western hands know Wild Bill Wellman, though, director of bleak critiques like 'The Ox-Bow Incident'. The chilling climax, therefore, refuses to simplify the tensions between community, family, and the violence needed to protect them, and can be now seen as foreshadowing the complexities of 'The Searchers'."
3,Is this Good Science?,"This book presents a very odd spectacle -- grown philosophers discussing a dualist theory of mind/brain interaction that is strikingly similar to L Ron Hubbard's theory of Thetan/meat interaction. It's especially appalling that Eccles drew the mind/brain line at precisely the point where the neuroscience of the day ended: we can find cells for feature recognition, so that's in the brain; we can't find cells for 3D object recognition, so that's in the mind. You would think that Popper's theories of what makes good science would reject this kind of thinking. Is the Mind of this book even falsifiable?On the other hand, Eccles' section two is a well-written and unusually readable summary of brain research."
5,Sink strainer,I had purchased a bronze colored faucet.I had to order sink strainer separate and this matches so well withmy faucet. I am very pleased with the product.
5,Another Great M&D Product!,"I am a huge fan of Melissa & Doug products and this did not disappoint! My 6 mo old LOVES this thing. He can twist and twirl it and he especially likes to chew on the 'antennae'. When given a selection, he usually picks this toy out of the pile. It's extremely well made (as are all of their things) and is something that can easily be passed down. Love it!"
1,This is a must NOT see!,"This makes my top five horrible movies of all times list! Just dreadful. I loved ""The Cell"" with Lopez and was looking forward to part 2. There is almost no conncetion to the first movie. The acting his horrible. My seven year old could have produced a more intriguing and convincing plot. The worst part of all, however is the creative, stunning, amazing costuming and artful imagery of the first movie is completely non existent in this one. It is predictable and and a total snooze fest. Nothing to see here folks, move along!"
1,"Do a search on Lentek and FTC or Lentek and bankruptcy,","In 2002 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charged Lentek with making false and unsubstantiated claims in advertisements for its electronic mosquito and pest repellers and its air cleaning products. Six months later Lentek signed an agreement with the FTC to stop making such claims. In 2003 Lentek went through bankruptcy and was taken over by Koolatron.The Centers for Disease Control(CDC) tested electromagnetic and ultrasound devices and found they do not work.Neither Lentek or Koolatron has produced studies showing the products work.Before buying, do a search on various combinations of Lentek, FTC, bankruptcy, Koolatron."
3,Dinnerware set,I liked the product. I found the soup bowl to big. But in general I think for the price I paid the product was better than I thought
2,SHOULD HAVE WAITED LONGER,"Classic second-album mistakes. After such a terrific debut, Ms. Earle ought to have waited longer; much of this disc, while OK, could be outtakes from the first. She's a better writer and could evem do better with well-chosen covers. Worse, the disc both lacks the purity of production of ""Simple Gearle"" and displays in at least two instances another classic second-disc problem: never, but never, let artists into the control room or they will start using production effects (dub, maxi-reverb) on their songs. Singer-soulmates Iris DeMent and Gillian Welch both waited forever to deliver second discs, with great results. Ms. Earle could better have watched them, and emulated.Now, the pressure will be on to do a great third or she'll be a lifetime coffee-house hit. Wish her luck."
2,Look elsewhere,"In need of a humidifier and having read some of the reviews, I decided to purchase the Hamilton Beach Humidifer.The pros: 1. On the ""quiet"" setting the water usually lasts 24+ hours before needing a refill.The cons: 1. The machine is far from quiet on any setting.2.It humidifies far less square footage than specified, even on the highest setting.3.It eats filters, which are difficult to find by the way. If you decide to purchase this item, buy several replacement filters.4.The tank cap is difficult to remove and appears to have been designed for the hands of a small child, but a child with the strength of an adult.5. It is relatively expensive. I have a warm mist model that works just as well and requires only a bit more attention to maintain."
4,Works Great! Just what I wanted...,"After reading all the mixed reviews on this product, I bought it anyway as it seemed the best deal for the amount of space I needed to humidify (1100- 1200 sf). I was pregnant and it was winter and I was getting pretty dehydrated from the drying heat in my apartment. Within days I was sleeping soundly waking refreshed and no longer having headaches. I would have given this 5 stars but it's the first I bought and I cannot make any comparisons.I am not sure what the reviewers that reviewed this product badly expected, having to refill it often just means that it is putting a lot of moisture into the air, the noise is not overwhelming and is similar to any white noise often used to put and keep kids asleep, I had no problem refilling it, my 2 year-old even liked to help, finally if you turn the filters faithfully once a week 2-3 filters should last the season."
4,Nice construction but faulty humidity gauge,"The humidifier is easily assembled and seems to be constructed of a quality material. Upon setup, the machine ran quite smoothly and quietly...certainly quieter than virtually every other manufacturer. However, after it operated for about 2 minutes, the humidity gauge pegged at >60%, shutting down the machine. Using another humidity gauge, I verified that humidity in the room was less than 30%. As such, I have arranged for a replacement humidifier. I'll give Hamilton Beach one more shot to see what happens. Else, it's back to the drawing board.ADDENDUM: The replacement humidifer works fine. It seems that the humidity gauge is still not the most accurate, but it works nonetheless once it starts going. Recently, I found that I if vary the place of the humidifier to be more central to the room, it works much more efficiently."
3,"Works ok, but after 2 years mine is getting flaky...","I've had this for 2 years now. It is quiet, but not silent. It is reasonably easy to fill, but it emties about once a day and that does become a chore quickly.My biggest complaint is the loud click that the relay switch inside it makes as it turns itself on and off. Even worse, my sensor seems to have gotten the jitters over the years. Instead of a steady readout, it bounces around up or down a percent or two. This makes the machine turn itself on and off quite often. Sometimes it cycles on for one second, off for one sec, on for one second, off for one second, etc. This wouldn't matter if the click wasn't so loud...I would give it 4 stars, but since mine seems to be on its death bed already I'm giving it 3."
5,Glad I took a chance.,"Loved this book. The characters are the kind you come to care about. Would love to see a sequel about how Hunter, Sydney, Jocelyn, Maggie and the ""Vikings"" make out."
5,Excellent!,This is one of the best progressive metal albums I've heard in my life. Keith Sudano is probably the most amazing singer in this genre. Buy it and see for yourself.
3,"works well, but not easy to set up.","The soaker ring works well. The trouble is when you try to connect your garden hose to it. The Y fitting that attaches to the garden hose doesn't have a rotating attachment so you must spin the entire soaker ring to attach it to the garden hose. This means you can't wrap it around the tree until AFTER you connect it to the garden hose. I also found that it is difficult to get the Y fitting tight on either end of the soaker hose, so it leaks a little.If you never want to move the soaker ring to another tree, or put it away, you'll probably like it just fine. But otherwise you will curse every time you try to set it up around another tree."
5,Genius,"if you enjoy listening to garbage hip hop such as:50 cent, Nelly, Lil'Jon, etc...this album is not for you.If you enjoy underground hip hop, then i recommend this. If you a fan of Company Flow, then you NEED to get this.If you are looking for something different, pick this up, and just listen to the words, and nice productions.peace!"
2,Love purple basil,I bought these to grow plants now (in winter) inside and they arrived quickly. I love making purple basil vinegar and can't get any in stores at this time of year. But they didn't germinate.
5,Amazing!,"I put this book down only once! after I had read it cover to cover, and then looked back on a few of the many interesting things I learned. It's amazing! I started trying a few things out immediately and can not beleive how easy this is to do! Not only is it a fun read, the writers style makes you feel like you are talking over a cup of coffee. I hope another book comes soon, I can't wait for more! such great information I now use every day."
5,A Great Pocket Knife,"Everyone should have this knife in his pocket or her purse; another one on his / her keychain!1) The blade is very sharp.2) The scissors is vey functional. Some people don't like the spring, but it's ok to me.3) I'm hoping they will put a ball-point pen on this knife."
5,Just What I Needed,"I already had a large, extremely well made Swiss army-type pocket knife that I keep in my purse at all times. But I especially needed a good tweezers and toothpick that I could keep in my pocket, on the dash of my car and next to both of my easy chairs at all times also. I was pleased to be able to get them with a screw driver, nail file, scissors and very small pocket knife! These little guys are perfect and what a great price."
3,not bad,"It is small and compact, worth the price I paid for. Easy for travel purpose.I would recommend buying it."
5,Swiss Army Knife,"I've had a number of Swiss Army Knives in the past and I find them to be extremely useful. My family knows that I have the instrument with me and there is always something that has to be scissored, cut, etc."
5,The Perfect Pocket Knife!,"I purchase my knife used and the gentleman who sold it to me cleaned it all up and sharpened the blade as sharp as a razor! I like having the sissors o the knife along with the nail file, tweezers and toothpick. athe knife is perfect for opening mail and packages and cutting line. This is a handy knife to have."
5,Good choice,I bought this for my husband to replace his old pocket knife. He loves the slim profile and the look of the product. Very nice.
5,Great little pocket knife,What a bargain. So much for so little. Glad Amazon carries these little beauties.
5,Great stocking stuffer gift,"I have used the full size Victorinox knives for years. This little guy was super , handy gift for my wife."
5,"HANDY, COMPACT, NOT OVERLY GADGETY","THIS IS THE MOST USEFUL THING I CARRY. SMALL & LIGHTWEIGHT, NO USELESS ATTACHMENTS. I AM A HELICOPTER MECHANIC AND HAVE HAD LEATHERMANS, GERBERS & ALL FORMS OF POCKET KNIVES AND HAVE ABANDONED THEM ALL FOR THIS SIMPLE TOOL. THE TOOTHPICK I USE DAILY, THE TWEEZERS WORK GREAT FOR WOOD AND METALLIC SPLINTERS, THE KNIFE IS ADEQUATE FOR OPENING PACKAGES & OTHER ROUTINE CUTTING TASKS AND THE FILE HELPS KEEP A MECHANIC'S FINGERNAILS LOOKING ALMOST HUMAN. THE SCISSORS ARE GREAT FOR A QUICK NAIL TRIM, AND WILL HOLD UP TO MORE ABUSE THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT ON OTHER MATERIALS. THIS IS AN INDISPENSABLE PART OF MY GEAR."
4,"Convenient, albeit a little pricy","The convenience offered by a Swiss Army Knife is unparalleled by another other device of its size. The sharp blade, scissors, and even nail file are very handy. However, I do think that ~$11 is a bit much for an item of *such* a small size. Overall, though, very good."
1,This is a false advertisement. Don't buy!,"The product features states that:Contains six stainless-steel toolsTools include knife blade, scissors, nail file with screwdriver tip, toothpick, and tweezersIncludes key ringBut when the shippment arrived, I only received the pocket knife; no tweezers, toothpick and key ring. Amazon sent me an replacement. But I received the exact same thing. What a joke! I was told they're going to investigate on this, and it'll take 7-10 business days. I'll update this after I hear from them. Don't buy now unless you want to pay for something you are not going to receive. By the way, it's a cute knife."
3,Victorinox Pocket Knife One MAJOR FLAW,"I'm with the other reviewer it's a well made knife, and fits on your key chain.. BUT there is one major flaw. The ring that attaches to your key chain is on the WRONG side. Hinders your ability to use the blade. I purchased even reading the review but now that i have it, yea i would probably pass on it. Do they not do any R&D on this knife? Seems like a simple fix to me, and you can immediately notice the issue. Change the ring attachment to the other end and 10/10..."
5,Great little knife,"We purchased this for our young son, just as we purchsed this same product for older son when he was young. It is a perfect small knife to teach responsibility and etiquette in knife handling. The blades are sharp. We love Isra'el and enjoy the reminder of the country on the Knife."
5,Swiss Army knife with USA Flag,"Wow, I couldn't believe it when I saw this available for Christmas. Really cool and just as good as the original red. Get one today for family and friends."
4,It's a Victorinox.,"Not a Wenger, but it's ok. (Lost my Wenger that had a bottle opener and 2 screwdrivers as well as scissors and nail file, thought this was a replacement, but no to be)"
5,Great product,"I have always carried one of these small swiss army knives in my purse. The nail file, knife, and scissors are always coming in handy and the tweezers are really great for splinters and the occasional stray hair. I bought this one for my daughter as it glows in the dark and she tends to misplace things or have a hard time finding things in her purse. This one is absolutely perfect for her!!!! She loves her knife as much as I love mine. It is a wonderful product that lives up to the Swiss Army reputation. I highly reccomend this little gem for any woman to carry on her key chain!"
5,Very satisfied,"I wasn't expecting the knife to be so beautiful! I'm really impressed with the quality of it. I tested out the knife right away by coring an apple, wow, the blade is really sharp! All in all, It's a really excellent pocket knife. You also have to love the blue!"
5,Great small pocket knife. As in pretty small.,"Just so nobody gets confused here, this is a very small pocket knife. To be worn on a key chain. Nothing remotely what is considered EDC (every day carry). But here is why I got it: You get a small blade which is good enough to cut open little packages/string/etc. Scissors, a nail file and what I like the best....tweezers and a toothpick. None of the high priced Leatherman etc. multitools have tweezers, and if you ever had a nasty splinter you know how important tweezers can be."
2,too small to use,I got this for my boy scout's birthday. He really liked it and it is cute but it was a lot smaller than I thought it was. I'm not sure if it is usable. My son hasn't tried using this yet.
1,TOYS,"I know I'll get flamed for writing this review, but I just can't take it anymore. A SAK is more of a status symbol or a knife for a medac ranger than a edc knife. SAK's are for people who really don't like knives. Do you really need a knife with a toothpick? I'd take a GEC or a Case and spend ten times more any day."
5,What's not to like,This knife is perfect for everyday use. I have carried one of these in my pocket for years. I lost my previous one so I needed a replacement.
3,Good but it opens the wrong way,"I'm not sure whether I want to give this 3 or 4 stars. I've had one like this before and this one is better made. The idea is I keep it on my keychain, so I always have a knife at hand. The only problem is, the knife part opens in the wrong direction. It's attached at the same end as the keychain attachment. This means when you open it, the knife is sort of fighting against the keychain for space so it's harder to use. If it opened the other way, you'd be able to hold the keychain as a sort of part of the handle, and the blade would be free from any obstructions.Otherwise, it seems well-made although I just bought it."
5,it comes in handy,and small enought that I keep it with my keys. good enough for an average girl like me.
3,Beware of Translucent,"I love this knife -- everything about it, EXCEPT the translucent blue plastic which will show dirt underneath it after a couple of years.Since 1982 one of these Swiss Army Classic knives has gone into my pocket every day with my car keys. I have owned only three. The one that I have now is this translucent blue model. Bought it four years ago. It still works great. Does everything that I expect of it. BUT now it looks yucky, showing all the dirt collected from four years in my pocket. So, I am ready to retire this one and go back to a classic red model. That one deserves a full five stars.I cannot live without a Swiss Army Classic knife in my pocket. If they only lasted one year, I would buy a new one every year. For about $12, we are talking a buck a month if you replace it every year. My three knives cost me about $30 total. Since 1982, that works out to about a dollar a year. Huge Bargain!"
3,Vitorinox Swiss Army Classic knfe,I was delighted with the pocket knife. It is easy to carry on my key ring and most useful.
2,too small.....,"I purchased this for my 13 yr old son and it is so small he can barely open up the parts. He tried to use it once, and has not touched it again-he wants a ""large"" one for Christmas."
2,Too small for daily usage,I didn't know a knife can be made this small until I got the shipment. It is too small to be used to peel the apples. It ended up disappearing in my son's toy box.I suggest you read the specification carefully before place an order.
4,My 3rd,"This is my 3rd SA pocket knife over last 10 years. Both previous knives got lost. Between 1st and and 2nd ones I've tried a cheap Chinese knock-off - thrown it away myself.This knife is the best in its category, though, I must say, Swiss Army products carry reputation that generally exceeds their quality. One star off for knife's tendency to have scissors spring broken after a year or two."
2,Poor Quality,"I am usually not critical of things but, this product should have never been sent. 4 boards were broken and it was put together very poorly.They used very cheap wood. I t was not worth my time to send it back. I do woodworking so I spent 3 hours repairing it. I used oak to replace the wood and glue and screws to hold together. It is now very solid. The design is nice but the workmenship is very poor. If I were you I would not sell this product again. It will give you a bad reputation. Thank you for listen to me. John Emanuel"
1,First Cause,"God created the universe and everything in it, including evolution,orsomehow the first atomic particle magically created itself into being.(Either way, they're both miracles! Why can't Atheists realize that?)Atheist fallacy: God can't appear from thin air, but it's okay for atoms to."
3,Worth Reading,"Could have been titled ""True Skeptics and True Believers"" as each extreme exists. Demonstrates fairly well the dependency that science and faith have upon one another, and that neither nullifies the other."
5,a good read,"I enjoyed this book very much. I heard myself saying again and again ""yes, yes, yes... that's how it is!"". Chet presents a philosophy in a straightforward and logical way. No longer is atheism a 4-letter word equivalent in meaning to immorality. Chet talks about having your eyes wide open in this world and (from personal experience) allows the reader to lose years of guilt for not conforming to the religious majority. After reading this book, I fully intend to look more into humanist philosophies and organizations."
2,A disappointment,"My wife is DEATHLY afraid of mice so that was our primary intention of this product. We plugged it in, but the mice still seemed to stick around. We killed a spider right by the device! Our house is small so it should have been able to handle it. I tried all the settings I could think of. Also tried it in different plugs. Hopefully you'll have better luck."
2,Beware of diet food offered that has no carb content listed,Beware of diet food offered that has no carb content listed.Why buy if there is no nutritional fact panel?
4,good old heroes!,"i have allways enjoyd good warfilms, and the 4 films in this box, all had eyerything such a film needs! Good story, suspence and good actors! I was very pleased with my boxset, thank you Amazon, i allways get good service! :)"
5,Great War Movie Collection,"These are great movies! Gray Lady Down, I had never heard of before, a good white knuckle movie. Also, I am a fan of Audie Murphy."
4,Great until the handle broke,Bought this after trying many others. It is the best balance in terms of sound vs. capacity. Humidistat works well. Really I was very pleased until the handle broke (after ~6 months).
1,Noisy,I bought one of these heaters. It was noisy to begin with but then after a couple of weeks it began making LOTS of noise. We took it back and exchanged it for another one just like the first. It also was very noisy! We ended up exchanging it for a different brand that is MUCH nicer -- not as noisy and heats the room better.
5,This book helps to make golf fun!,"Ann Kelly writes a fun little book that focuses on everything that the new golfer needs to know - what to wear, what to bring, which club to use, rules and tons of useful comments. She also does a great job of reminding the reader that golf is fun and that you are out on the course to enjoy yourself in a beautiful location. I'm sure that there are lots of tips in here for any golfer. And I like the fact that she doesn't take the game too seriously."
5,New golfer age 65--ITS MY BIBLE,"Got this as a gift-it was interesting--but as I started with lessons it became ""MY BIBLE ""-it cuts to the chase and simplifies the facts-what this book tells you certainly does help you to feel more informed on what you Need to know and what other golfers EXPECT you to know---I walk with more confidence about the course even though my striking of the ball is sometimes lacking--but with having this confidence I know my ball strokes will become better and better!!!!-hope to be a good golfer!!!!!Thanks Ann Kelly--for having loved the game so much that you wanted to share it with others by easing those Jitters that even you must have once had"
1,The BARE Minimum of information,"After reading the glowing reviews I thought this book would be an excellent source of information for the beginner. Instead it is incredibly small, over-priced and written almost in outline form. ""Feeling Naked..."" barely touches on the basics. There are far better books for the female or male beginner that cover this wonderful game in the detail it deserves. Check out ""The Complete Idiots Guide to Golf"" or ""Golf for Dummies"" - they are far better choices."
5,Midnight Louie,I was really glad to find this book to help complete my series about Midnight Louie. Book was in great condition and I'm enjoying the series.
2,Not working for me,"I put the Lentek PR21M to work on 3/13/02, I am still seeing spiders and ants after nine weeks. I am starting to doubt that this thing will work at all!"
4,Excellent Photographs of Ancient Artifacts of the Celts,"First I rated the book an 8 since it gives only brief accounts of the artifacts. Pictorally, it is easily rated as a 10. It's a mini-book measuring only about 5"" x 5"" and every couple of pages begins with a new artifact or item. Well done, again with excellent photographs. This is not an in-depth study of the Celts, but an excellent overview for those with a beginning interest in what their culture was composed of."
5,good buy,replaced a inside water bowl for the dogs with this as every time they took a drink they .... splashed water onto the floorwith this they get to drink from it up higher and there is less mess on the floorbucket is sturdy and attractive enough to have inside the home
5,Great Ghostie Stories !!!,"I remember reading this book ,Probably in 1973,Was a great book kept me on my toes and could hardly put it down.Was one of the books that spurred my interest in reading as a child."
2,doesn't convince me,"Usually I like what you call ""Neo-Soul"". This artist reminds me a bit of Nicolette. But for me this is too less song and melody...."
4,Town and Country,"Slim Aarons really knew how to capture the jet set of a certain era, his images are so well crafted and the lucky subjects are always shown in there best light, literally and figuratively. The best picture in an array of amazing photography, and one that perfectly captures this rarified air, is the iconic picture of CeZe Guest standing by her pool, it captures all you need to know good and bad, through the prism of a beautiful woman, in a beautiful setting without a seeming care in the world, the very definition of, ""To the Manor Born"". Mr. Aarons captures so perfectly a life of unapolegetic jet setting opulance, and whether he means to are not he also captures the shallowness of it all, and you wonder, with all of this, are these people really any happier than the rest of us?"
3,Have to agree,"I read the previous review, didn't take it seriously enough, and had to learn the hard way. The silver is great. The gold, on the other hand, is not just matte, it might as well be called ""medium brown"". It's not metallic in the least."
5,Blue Sunshine - a 70's ode to Reefer Madness,"""Blue Sunshine"" is a totally freaky flick. The plot revolves around a number of murders committed by seemingly ordinary people who suddenly lose all their hair and go insane. All of the them attended Stanford together 10 years earlier and tripped on an LSD derivative - ""Blue Sunshine"" - which has apparently resulted in a ""chromosomal aberation"" which gives them a delayed-onset homicidal madness.It's pretty low-budget, yet effective. One of edgier scenes involves a newly-deranged bald-headed babysitter chasing a couple of little kids around their apartment with a Ginsu. As a horror movie, its shocks are tame - but creepiness abounds.Also included in this ""limited edition"" set is the original soundtrack CD."
1,Disppointed in Dr Woods,"I didn't know I was getting Dr. Woods, not Dr. Bronners when I bought this (my own fault) and am therefore, VERY disappointed. It does not lather nearly as well as Dr. Bronners unless you use half the bottle. You get what you pay for. I thought it was such a great deal. Spend the extra on Dr. Bronners."
4,Great Castille Soap,"Amazon shipping came through as expected. No boxes dripping half my purchase. The price I paid was great. I recieved a large amount (seems like more than a quart) of soap that will last for several projects. The soap itself seems very high quality, though I have to disclose that I've never used castille soap before. I would definitely recommend this product and supplier to anyone."
2,Short filter life,I had read a lot of reviews for the humidifier before purchasing. I like to humidifier but the filter is expensive and has a short life. I end up using at least one a month. It gets moldy easily even though I change the water every day and follow the cleaning instructions.
1,It didn't work,"The only available outlet in my son's room was behind his bed. After a few months of having the PestContro in place (and not noticing any lack of pests), I moved the bed only to find a Daddy Long Legs spider living happily in the web it attached to the no pest unit!"
3,How do you know if it is working?,"I have this plugged in just inside the back basement door where any vermin or insects might find to enter. I have not had a problem with either, so I have to assume that it is working! I do have various spiders, but nothing else. Have had it for several years."
1,"worked great for a week, then --> kaput","The humidifier worked great for a week, it was quiet and did a great job of humidifying the room. After about a week, it stopped working. We tried everything to no avail. Called the company, and they did stand behind the product and took it back about 2 weeks ago. Said it would be 4-6 weeks before we got a new one. Stay tuned. still hasn't arrivd as yet."
4,I'm here to shop for my second HWM2030,"I came to Amazon to shop for a replacement for my six-year old Honeywell HWM2030. THIS IS A GREAT HUMIDIFIER! Truly. I took care of it by soaking it in vinegar to remove the mineral deposits and it lasted me faithfully for six years. I stored it carefully every summer. It was well worth the $35 I paid for it and I'm going to buy another one. Other humidifiers I've used did not have as large of a capacity or had water caps that were difficult to close. This one is easy to use, easy to clean, and thoroughly dependable. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Great while it lasted,"My room felt like a tropical rain forest for the eight days that it worked. Then the humidity sensor stopped working, and if it doesn't sense the humidty it won't run. Also this is not a Honeywell product. It's made by a company called Kaz under license to Honeywell. And they charge ten dollars for returns plus shipping and handling. For a thirty two dollar humidifier what's the point? You buy cheap you get cheap. Also if you have hard water I would NOT recommend this. They recommend weekly cleaning of the heating coil. I have hard water and checked after five days and practically had to chisel off the deposits. All in all, not a very good product."
1,Did not deliver as promised,"The humidistat did not work properly. The walls and ceiling were soaked and the window was steamed up, but it still didn't shut off even when the humidistat was lowered. It was very quiet though except for the occasional glug as it used up more water."
3,Havent used yet but....,"I havent used this yet, but when I got it there were random black hairs on it, it was kinda gross. They should be more careful about packaging. Yuck!"
3,1969 Travelogue...Does not hold good Today,"I read this book the first time in 1987. In the 19 years since it was written, India had hardly moved, stifled by Nehruvian bureaucracy and a cynical polity that simply invented more and more regulation to plunder India's economy.However, all this changed in the 1990s. Freed from the worst of the soviet-style regulatory burdens, India's economy and society has moved forward with a pace that is only surpassed by China's. It hasn't done so fast enough to solve deep-seated socio-economic problems that keep getting exacerbated by an ever-growing population, but compared to Mr. Naipaul's ""Area of Darkness"", India resonates with hope and its people with a deep impatience to get a move on to better times.Read this book for its historical context but don't delude yourself by thinking this is the India of today. For that, you need to refer to something more recent."
3,A truthful picture on as-it-is basis,"VS Naipaul flair for travel writing is at its best. With the senstivity that we all possess but seldom express, he views India absolutely objectively and present an engrossing tale of his journey. Mixed with his internal turmoil and feelings that all those who have travelled through India feel but fail to notice. He makes no bones about the the sqatters alongside reilway tracks, withered and poor Indian physique, or the dishonesty prevalent everywhere. But like most Naipauls works this one too is very critical with little praise for the good. Or is it that he saw no good at all, or that its not worth mentioning ? Read and find out."
1,Nothing Sweet About this Crap,"I purchased this book based upon the description provided by Amazon, and because I enjoy a good M/M romance. Unfortunately, I was rolling my eyes before I'd even finished reading the first page! What absolute rubbish. The author did show some talent in telling a story, but I didn't care about the characters, and the dialogue was way too modern for a 19th century tale. I also feel that excessive, porn-style sex was used to keep the audience interested, rather than to enhance the relationship (what relationship?) between the main characters. I would have given this book zero stars if I'd been able to. Therefore, I recommend that you save your money; I didn't even get half way through this mess before tossing it where it belongs - in the garbage."
5,Neat problem solver,"My old wireless jacks had finally bit the dust so I bought these. Talk about easy, plug the base in first and then the slave and that's it.. I use it to supply telephone for my Dish set up as there is no phone outlet near by."
2,"Works for a fax machine, but really too noisy for voice calls.","I bought this for a fax machine, which works well. I tried to make a voice call, and you can barely hear anything because of horrible static. I tried different outlets closer to the transmitter but that barely helped to clear the noise."
5,Best Album of the Year?,"Does it really matter how this album compares to Underwater Moonlight? What counts is that it may be the best album to come out in the past year. I'll admit this is the first Hitchcock album I've ever owned, but it seems a pretty good place to start. Mr. Kennedy and Sudden Town have fantastic energy and great hooks, while My Mind (though more mellow) may actually be the best song on the record."
3,"Great weight tree, but didn't fit our weights","My husband and I were so excited to find this weight tree online. However, the weight tree has larger diameter posts for the weights to be put on. Our weights have smaller holes, and they didn't fit. The quality of the tree was good, and it was packaged well."
5,Exactly as Represented,"I purchased several of these pashminas for my daughter's wedding party and one for myself in cream. They are very very soft, but also have a little cripness and sheen. They seem like they will wear well. Some of the reviews (other colors) complain they are very thin, but for a dressy look and for the price they are just right."
3,Filters not as good as they used to be and are higher in price.,"I have been disapointed in the last filters I purchased for my humidifier. The price has gone up by several dollars and although the filters are suppose to be good for at least a month, I am finding they are not even lasting that long. I regularly clean my humidifier and make sure the water tank is odor free, I am disappointed and plan on sending a email to Hamilton Beach directly. Good Luck!"
4,Okay product,"First of all, I have soft water at my house. The hardness of your water supply will affect how dirty the filter becomes. As long as the filter is turned upside down after every fill-up it does last for about a month and 1/2 to 2 months. I also purchased a warm steam humidifier which we prefer over this cool air type. The filters need to be replaced a bit sooner, but they are cheaper to do so."
2,Very disappointed!!!,"The humidifier started leaking after a few weeks. In another website, a few reviewers also had this problem. The water overflows from the reservoir to the unit and onto the floor and does not stop until the tank is empty. Very annoying!! The filter has not lasted long and started smelly funky the third day of use. It is also way too expensive."
2,Bad filter,I got my humidifier a week ago. And my filter already changed his color to yellow. Plus adds some bad odor to the air coming from humidifier. So be ready to get a couple of this filters if you using humidifier a lot
2,Short-lived,"The filter lasts for about two weeks, after which it turns completely useless: it stops soaking up water more than two inches from the bottom (the rest of it remaining dry as the Sahara desert), thereby rendering the humidifier totally useless at any speed. The cost of filters for a single season is more than the price of the humidifier itself."
4,I LIKE IT,This is the best I have ever used. Being a redhead it is hard to get something that is light enough and you can adjust the color.
4,ERA Review,"This is a wonderful CD. I first heard the recording when on a vacation in Israel. It was played as the processional at a beautiful wedding. During the entire trip I tried to find it. I couldn't find it anywhere. Not knowing the artist or song didn't help. While at the airport preparing for my flight back to the US, I heard it playing at a music store in the airport gallery. It is a wonderful CD with upbeat music. I find it relaxing and good music to sleep with."
5,PRAISE THE LORD,"WOW, What an anointed worship cd and to GOD BE ALL THE GLORY, Prophetess is anointed and to GOD BE ALL THE GLORY. I always buy these as gift for others."
1,I hate chihuahuas and this movie,"Chihuahuas are nasty-looking creatures. I'd call them rat-dogs, except rats are actually pretty cute. The movie trailer, with its stupid ¡Ay Chihuahua! song, was culturally inescapable for seemingly months, and I will not forgive it for that.I have not seen this movie. I am only downrating it so that, hopefully, Amazon will stop recommending this pile of nasty to me."
1,HOW COULD SUCH A LITTLE DOG LEAVE SUCH A BIG STEAMING PILE?!,"Judging by the box office receipts you would think this silly film would have to be great!...Well It's not even good! I have seen so many of these gimmick films, but this one is one of the worst. 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua' is a steaming pile and makes 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' look like an Oscar winner by comparison. I actually liked The Chipmunk movie, so don't think I don't care for these goofy gimmick films. In short, the jokes are lame, the film seems way longer than it is and the idea has been done to death! Skip this turd!"
1,terrible quality through Amazon,The sound needed to be turned all the way up and the video quailty was very poor. The movie is good but I wouldn't get it through amazon.
4,Great family movie,"This is a great family movie. The adults, preteen and 7 year old in our home all enjoyed it. Highly revommended"
2,It was great...until it broke,"Overall this is a great value mask, considering it is easy to adjust, has a tight seal and does not fog readily. But there's one problem...you can't use the mask when the straps break. After about 3 hours of use one of the straps broke. It still works, but the seal is not as tight, and is not quite as comfortable. It is probably only a matter of time before the other strap breaks too. So overall1. great mask2. crappy strapsif you buy this1. buy yourself some strong straps"
4,Out of order (But still a good show),"The order of the episodes on the DVDs is not the same as the original order of their broadcast. This doesn't really matter, since each episode is pretty much entirely self-contained, so this doesn't really mess up the continuity at all, but I still find this feature really weird. So, keep that in mind if you want to watch in the actual broadcast order.Other than that, its a great show, as lots of other reviews have said."
3,Happy Happy,"As you get through the seasons the characters develop a history with one another, building up to those moments where you realize that you get their inside jokes. The players are histrionic to the point that one simply finds their lovable and spectacular identities irresistible."
5,Excellent!,"I pre-ordered Tommy's new DVD and received it within days of the release date. I'm half-way through it and find that this is a DVD I'll be referring back to and using for a LONG time. I wish I had it when I first started playing, but I'm happy to have it in my toolbox now!"
2,Great!,"Very informative. tommy Igoe is an awsome drummer and he teaches drumming in simple terms that you can understand. But in order to get better... practice, practice, practice!"
5,Great Hands for a lifetime,"Tommy Igoe did a great job constructing this video. This allows anyone at any level the opportunity to improve their technique and understand why they're doing it. Also, for anyone without formal training, it makes some of the rudiments more understandable and applicable to playing situations. I see it as a ""must have"" for anyone who wants to improve upon their current level, whatever that might be."
2,Giant Earphones,"So these might be great sound quality, but for a woman with normal ears they were HUGE. I bought them to train for a 10k and there is no way they would have stayed on while running. I couldn't even get them seated comfortably in my ears. I returned them and went with something a little smaller."
2,Nice fan with cheap bearings...,"Yeah, it will last for a few years until the cheap bearings fail... then you'll hear a low rumble at first which goes away for awhile when they warm up. After that it will get louder. Soon it will just seize and stop. That's when you discover that the motor has overheated and burned out although there will be no visible indication of that fact. It just won't rotate at all. That has been my experience."
5,Best Fan I've Ever Owned,"It's a sad day for me. My Vornado 610 just died tonight, after running 24/7 on full power for nine years and one month. It probably would have lasted longer, but I admit I never once cleaned it like I should. Almost every other fan I've owned has died after one or two years of this treatment in the Texas heat. This is by far the best fan I've ever owned, and I'm getting another one as soon as possible.Seriously, just buy it."
2,Fan - low air flow for the high cost,"I am using this fan for about a month. True it is quite, tilt-able and small but it also lacks the ability to create a strong airflow for the high cost. I bought this fan when my 5yr old box fan, cost about $15, stopped running. The box fan created at least 2x the airflow for much less cost. The reviews give an impression that this fan produces a strong airflow - not in my estimation."
3,"Good bowl, ok color",I use this bowl in my office. The bowl I had before got kicked accidentally a few times resulting in a spill. This bowl does what a needed - it stays put and stands up to some bumping without making a mess - and is quite sturdy so I think it will last.I would have preferred to choose the color - I wouldn't have picked the green one I received.
2,ok but not what i thought,Said it was heavy weight but was not what I thought Is not weighted well and jumbo is not very big for a big dog Would send back but would cost more than than what I paid in the long run Very disappointed. We put a Ice cream plastic cartine in it to hold all th water
1,Birthday songs cd disney,Item was purchased as an used item - decription of excellent condition. Unfortunately the item was in poor condition - constant skipping during play.
4,Obvious stuff,"Thumbs up.Not that I was expecting an earth shattering revelation, but the content of this book is mostly obvious information presented in a very inspiring and a delightful way. People on various occasions get an urge to take a long unpaid break from work/city/chaos and see the world in its raw form. Most of them know the benefits of such exercise but rarely do they act of this urge.This book serves as a kick in the a** that can get you motivated to do something about your desire to travel.I haven't yet acted on it, but nevertheless, a good read."
2,It was good in the beginning,"After much use I noticed the visible rusting inside the bottom portion of the pot so I doubt it is stainless steel. The knob or valve on the bottom portion of the pot leaks water. I""m looking for a replacement stovetop coffee maker now."
2,disappointed,"I received this espresso maker as a gift and initially was very pleased. However, after using it for two months the screw that holds the silicon knob in place on the lid started falling out. There are no threads holding the screw in so every time I use the espresso maker and wash it the knob comes off and I have to fish out the little screw inside the pot. It does make great espresso, but it's not worth the aggravation so I am currently shopping for another stovetop espresso maker. I don't know if this is a common problem for this type of espresso maker or just this particular brand. At any rate, I won't buy another Primula."
4,"You like it. You don't know why, but you like it.","When this song first came out, I thought it was kind of dumb. And I really tried to hate it, but I finally gave in and admitted that I liked it. The beat is great (The Neptunes weren't played out JUST YET), and although the song doesn't talk about much (if anything), you can still feel it. By the way, I agree with what Vibe magazine said: ""Who told Ray J to take his shirt off in the 'Wait A Minute' video?"""
4,You can never be too richly orchestrated or too thin,"Check out the marimba and the mellotron and the pizzacato strings in CHILD KILLERS. Check out the electric piano in COMING IN FROM THE COLD. Check out Emma's abrupt segue into the brief bridge of COMING IN. Check out the full-tilt orchestral bombast in IS THIS A PLAN. Check out Emma's creepy filtered delivery of ""some cold comfort will tell us what's true"" in NEVER LOOK AT THE SUN. NEVER LOOK also includes a brief weird bridge in which the sextuple time is slowed down so that you can fully savor Emma's scrumptious catatonia. There's 1 dud track: a dreary waltz called FAMOUS. But all the other tracks are dreary in the best sense of the word."
3,I didn't get what was in the picture,"but I liked what came and it fit, so I kept it. However, I think the picture should match what arrives at one's doorstep."
1,This air purifier does not work!,"... it didn't work at all. Supposed to be new, the light goes on but no ions are coming out ...I've had other brands of personal ionizer, Air Supply, Sharper Image, that do work. You can smell the ionization and there is a hum. This product is a dud."
4,Bent while using,"It didn't come with very good instructions, and it bent a little while I was using it to pry the fuel line from the filter. -1 star for being bent after just 1 use."
4,Heavy Haydn: Wonderful but not Jochum's best.,"This is the same performance of April 27, 1951 issued on the Melodram label. If you wish to read my review and suggestions, please refer to that version, also listed on Amazon.com. I have not heard this Archipel release, so I cannot comment on the quality of the sound. In sum: this is a delightful listening experience but ought not be one's introduction to Haydn's ""The Creation."" John Eliot Gardiner's recording would be an exellent first choice in the German version, along with Jochum's later 1966 recording in stereo. For the original English version, try either Christopher Hogwood or Robert Shaw."
4,Great first step,"A great first album. It's bands like this one who will bring back some punch and vitality to music. In a time when 'pop' is often a three-letter four-letter word, Tennis Pro shows time and again on this album that they've got the hooks...and they're not afraid to use them. Also, the thing practically screams summer."
4,Excellent book for recreational boaters,"This is an excellent book for all boaters. As a comercal captain, I found this book as an excellent refrence book for all general boating information. It does lack the more advanced information, but this information is generally not needed for a recreational pleasure boater"
1,Item came damaged 3 times and I had to purchase it elsewhere,Was very disappointed that a damaged item was sent to me 3 times. Purchased elsewhere.
5,Vornado really moves the air.,I have received great use out of this product. It effectively circulates the are unlike other fans I've used before. I will add that on the higher settings 2 and 3 respectively there is a noise factor. I have been able to reduce my electric bill by using thses fans. Would buy again and recommend for others.
2,Not really a 510,I ordered this 510 model but received a 530. The 510 is no longer available and the 530 is the newer version that this seller is sending in its place. It was quiet on the lowest setting but deafening on the middle and high setting. They look the same however the 530 is not the quality that earned the 510 those great reviews. I returned it and received a refund however I never would have placed the order and had to go through the hassle if I knew which item they were really selling.
1,Fan Stinks,I bought 2 of these fans 2 years ago. In the last week they both failed. The warranlty is use less. It costs you $12.00 to ship back and they want $ 15.oo to return it. Costs more then a new fan. What a dissapointment. Vornado sure went downhill. R.Schaeffer
1,Police ethics are much more than this,"After reading this book, I wondered whether the authors are or were cops themselves. At least one of them (Crank) isn't, and never has been. This makes sense, because the ethics cases presented in this book are bland and barely skim the surface of what we (cops) go through every day. On the face of it, the ethics questions seem reasonable. To those of us in the profession, they are laughable. Sorry, but this book is another one of those written by college professors who don't really understand the world of the cop."
1,Piece of junk!,"Overpriced piece of junk! The pole bends, the plastic cap doesn't cover the section of the piece that extends, and the metal is flimsy and non-brilliant in shine. Very disappointed!!"
4,Shower Caddy,"I purchased 2 of these caddies for both of our bathrooms. They go together very easily and offer ample space for all of our shower products. Be careful to position the caddy where you want it because if you try to slide it into place you run the risk of making a black mark on your ceiling with the black rubber endcap. I thought being stainless steel, the caddies wouldn't rust. But, we have found that we need to wipe down our shower to prevent rust and mildew from accumulating on the caddy. For the money, I was a bit disappointed."
1,Bad Product,"This product is not what i saw on the picture. The quality of ths tension pole, is soo poor. looks unfinish. is kind of imposible to fix it, because pieces dont fit!! Im not happy. i lost my money with it"
5,Best Beethoven I have heard,"The Spring Sonata no. 5 in F op 24 alone is worth the purchase price. As a musician, I have never heard a better collaborative performance. Pires playing is exquisite and Dumay interprets the violin part flawlessly. Truly inspiring."
5,Delicious!,"I love Oreos! My boyfriend is diabetic and these sugar-free cookies are our favorite. The texture is a little lighter than a regular Oreo, but they are just as sweet and crispy-creamy!I noticed a 1-star review on this product because the customer had not received the shipment. That's so unfair to the Oreo! I think that should be a seller review, not a product review. I mean, who doesn't love Oreos?!! C'mon....."
3,Good phone but...,I've had no problems with this phone HOWEVER it's impossible to find a replacement battery for it.
5,Great Detroit Rock,What a great album! What else can I say other than it is well recorded and in my opinion is the best album psycopathic records has ever put out. It rocks!
1,"One Of The Boys, Yes, But The Wrong One",Freed from the confines of The Who Daltrey indulges himself with schmaltz pop and hard rock misstepping. Avoid at all costs.
1,Lacking depth in analysis,Ghyka attempts to show the objects in nature are not randomly formed; he begins the with the concept of ratio and proportion in the plane; the golden section; and then to the regular polygons and geometric shapes in 3 dimensions. Then he rambles onto hypothesizing why an architecture design may seem striking. In doing so he makes gross assumptions which are to the point of being forced to fit his theories. The basic concepts that he delves; one can familiarize oneself with by a quick reference on the internet. Hence I do not recommend spending the time and money to read this book.
3,Various tools but disappointing quality,"This tool set has all components I wanted use in my house, but the quality was worse than I expected.It's hard to pull out drivers, ranch tools, etc from the tool box.Pricewise it's still good deal, but I will not buy any other Apollo tool later."
3,"Made in China, and the quality is...","You can understand what I wanna say.I will not buy Apollo products again.However for such a price, I cannot ask for more."
2,Very Cheaply Made,"This set of tools is very cheaply made, and in no respects is a 4-star product. It's below average (2 stars).The hammer is a kids size hammer. The little plastic box that holds the tiny screwdrivers doesn't stay in place.I have a similar toolbox set that I got in a hardware store, for somewhat of a similar price. I was expecting something more along that quality, as Amazon typically doesn't disappoint.I would not recommend Apollo to anyone."
4,Good quality and as represented,All useful tools for medium duty projects. Case works well for keeping pieces in place. Very nice for a wide variety of tools available at arms length.
3,"Easy to use, but not easy after use~","I bought this because my hands are always cold in the winnter. I like the part that the product heats up very fast and stay warm for a long time. But returning it to normal condition is not easy. It has to be boiled for a long time in a pot. I have to put a towel under the product, so it won't stick at the bottom of the top and break."
1,Extra Creamy Macaroni,"A well-known company that makes a popular brand of Macaroni & Cheese also sells a product that they ""craftily"" call ""Extra Cheesy Macaroni & Cheese"" at a higher price. What makes it extra cheesy? They include the same amount of cheese but fewer noodles. You are paying more, getting less.The same is true here.The same excellent record company, Rhino, has all the same tracks as on the Leo Sayer Essentials disc and four extras on a lower priced CD.That CD is ""The Very Best of Leo Sayer"" (search Amazon for B000046PVJ - it'll take you right there). The extra tracks aren't filler either. There's his top ten UK hit ""Moonlighting"", the original version of the recent Phil Collins hit ""Can't Stop Loving You"" and the original of ""Giving It All Away"" later a hit for Roger Daltrey.So save a buck and get more tracks. You can use your savings to buy more Mac & Cheese."
5,OEM Parts at crazy prices!,The HP Transfer kit I ordered came quickly and was packed well. I find it hard to believe this kit was selling for over $300.00 a few short months ago and I was able to purchase this item for less than $50.00. I had suspected that when the product arrived I might find it was not original OEM or was used or damaged in some way but figured I could always send it back if that were the case. As it turned out it was a factory fresh never opened box. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,A wonderful book!!,"I love Broken Bridge. It was painful and sad, but I still love it. It was very original in the story line and also it's characters. There is no one main character, and you'll be folowing the trail of thoughts of someone, and then all of a sudden you'll be following the trail of some one else in the room. It was hard, sometimes, to be left hanging on the edge when a chapter ended, only to find out what happens many chapters later. I think this is a very good writing style; it keeps you interested. Broken Bridge also had a good ending, with controversy between two cultures and, at the end, salaam. Peace."
2,Spinal Tap Revisited,"I had high hopes for this film for two reasons: a lot of people I know liked it and I really like Wilco. I just couldn't believe how CHEESY it was. Focusing on the turmoil between Jay Bennett and Jeff Tweedy as a central theme in the film was a little much. Wilco overcoming the soulless, behemoth, money driven record industry was GREAT! But I personally just didn't enjoy the way that very noble and proud accomplishment was presented. A wee bit sentimental for my taste (but then again so is a lot of Wilco's music). I still think they are a great band."
5,PLEASE release this!!,Come on.....Please release this already!!!!!!! Better include the BONUS footage from the 2-Disc DVD set.
5,Ranks With The Best,"This is a rock and roll documentary that can be enjoyed by anyone. Even if you don't know who Wilco is or if you're not a huge fan, this documentary can still be completely entertaining. It ranks with the best of the rock and roll documentaries including ""Don't Look Back"", ""The Last Waltz"" and ""Gimme Shelter"".What seemed to start out as an average making the album documentary turns into so much more as the band struggles and gives everything they have to make the album ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"" only to be rejected by the record label when they turn in the final version. Band members clash and Jeff Tweedy seems to be ready to have a nervous breakdown at any moment.If you don't know much about Wilco, this is a great way to get to know them. ""I'm Trying To Break Your Heart"" shows how one of the greatest albums of the past ten years was made and the determination it took to bring it to the world. I'm extremely greatful. Thanks Wilco."
4,Nice little pan!,I like these Nordic Ware pans however this 9-inch one's lid doesn't fit as well as my 9x13 pan. Less of a seal. Still really great though! Very high quality and has some girth behind it.
2,don't buy it,I bought this in 2007 and it is 2011 and I just cooked some Rhubarb Crisp and it sprang a leak. A very tiny hole. ( rhubarb surup all over the bottom of my oven.UGH!) Now I am 60 and have baking pans that are over 30 and 40 years old(some from my mom)...and they don't have leaks...now maybe this was a fluke but I don't think so...you can see where the pan has been scrapped on the bottom and all the little scrapes are a different color...I wouldn't buy this product nor recommend it to any one else..I was excited at first as it has a nice top that you use after baking in it. Maybe it will fit my next pan and if I have to fork over some bucks for the next one I will. I expect pans to last like my old ones.
1,tarnished after being put in dishwasher,"Bought this pan a few months back and it looked like a nice strong pan. Finally got around to using it; made some brownies and they cooked up nicely. BUT, after putting the pan in the dishwasher, the pan looks disgusting. It has a completely tarnished look all over and I don't feel I can safely use it again. Unfortunately since I waited so long to use it for the first time, it is too late to return to Amazon."
2,very hard interior,"This shoes interior are very hard, cushion is cheap, upper leather is thin, overall shoes are uncomfortable. The left shoe is also crooked. I need to return them."
4,Cute product,"I bought this set to go along with my daughter's matching dollhouse and it is very cute. The set comes securely wrapped and is as pictured. I also purchased the other furniture that matches for the other rooms and they are also very well made and sweet! Not really for rough play or lots of handling, but they serve the purpose well for dollhouse play."
5,Very cute!,"I ordered all of the Melissa and Doug furniture for my nieces. It is so very cute and pretty and detailed. I would buy this again. Also, I think that it is as sturdy as any small, detailed item could be. Also, it is the best priced doll furniture I've found."
4,Finally some color photos of cop cruisers!,"Most of the police car books on market are full of black and white pictures. As cop cars today are more colorful than only black and white it is great to have a book full of clear color pictures. Most of these not-your-traditional looking cruisers come from USA but there are also some pages dedicated to vehicles worldwide. Most of the pictures show ""normal"" everyday cars but lots of DARE and special vehicle pics are also presented here. Captions are mostly rather uninformative telling usually only where the car is from. Nice addition to text would have been for example year when that paint scheme was in use or when photo was taken. Also you won't find any technical data from this book but there are several other great publications about different manufacturer's police vehicles filled with technical details.This ""history"" is a welcome addition to growing number of police car books. Cop cars are not only B/W anymore!"
5,"Great craftsmanship, perfect!","I order the lamp in November and it just arrive in Late February. Instructions were easy to follow.After unpacking the product, I found it to be perfect for my application. It is made of quality material and reflects the price I paid for it."
2,A slow walk in the jungle (vhs),"I saw the trailer for this movie a long time ago and it made it look like the most violent, bloody war movie ever made. Well, it`s not. To make a convoluted story short: three soldiers find some gold and kidnap a vietnamese family to carry it for them while they walk to... someplace. All this is padded with footage from some ""command center"" and ""the present"" where some guy is researching a book. They walk into some boobytraps along the way but apart from three guys setting yet another trap, no vietcong`s, so don`t expect any action. It has a few good moments, the traps, a leg amputation and a ""sort of"" sex scene, but if you want jungle action, WARBUS, THE LAST HUNTER and EASTERN CONDORS are a lot better."
4,Smokey Brandon's Back,"Noreen Ayres adds to her Smokey Brandon series with the darkest and most moody installment yet. The suspense is as heavy as fog, and the menace of the narrative is unrelenting. The novel asks you in, and it won't let you leave."
3,"It's ok, could've been better","Lenny Bruce was way ahead of his time and like Bill Hicks who followed him he died way too young.This movie made in the early 70's is done by a friend of Lenny's and because of that assumes its audience knows too much.The whole thing is quite sad really I note with interest that he came to Australia and our government kicked him out as well.You know what would've been great if they had included as an extra on this DVD 'The Lenny Bruce Performance film' which was made shortly before he died so it could be played I gather at his next court appearance.You know something I have so many great recordings of 'Lenny Bruce' on record ,so many great live shows why don't you do yourself a favour and track these down instead then you will get value for money.It's your call but overall I was bit disappointed 'Lenny Bruce' deserves better."
1,please,"I do not wish to waste words on this worthless artist. If you like this, something is seriously wrong with you."
5,VERY GOOD,IN 2003 ONLY 2 CDS WERE RELEASED BY NO LIMIT - THIS AND MR. MAGIC ( WHITE EYES)THIS CD IS VERY GOOD WITH SOME SOLID SONGS WITH GUESTS SUCH AS curren$y and b.g. and of course BIG PERCYGET THIS CD - and pick up white eyes as well - it has a good song called war - produced by LIL JON.
3,"Works well, but replacement filters hard to find","We bought and used this last winter season and liked the auto shutoff feature when the room reaches a set humidity. The water tank had good capacity and was relatively easy to refill. However, at the end of the season's average use(2-3 months), we discovered that the filter was completely clogged/gross and needed to be replaced. It has been difficult to find a replacement filter at stores, until just now when I found the official Honeywell online site (follow the consumer retail division) to order replacement filters/parts. They cost (...) each plus shipping, so be prepared to spend that much each year additionally if you buy this humidifier. Over lifetime that can add up, so just be aware of this additional cost per average season use, which is why I'm giving it three stars."
2,"Filters get moldy, expensive replacement filters","Works fine, BUT the filter gets moldy if it dries out at all, then it's expensive to replace the filters. Running unit with any mold in the filter is an allergy risk. Find a model that is cheaper to maintain and monitor and doesn't pose a mold threat."
2,Loud but works when it works,"This humidifier is pretty loud compared to other ones I have used in the past. To get proper coverage in my 14x15 room, i had to turn it on high. After 1 winter season, it stopped cycling the water. I am now looking for a replacement. I would not buy it again."
3,"Ok, but in long documents, the ink is faint towards the end","If I print out a long document, 20 pages or so, the ink is faded on the last few pages. Other than that, it seems OK."
2,It's really bad.,"It has you going, and being an Animorph. Sounds good, right? No, it does a lousy job of you being an Animorph. It has you deside witch morph you use. And it doesn't have as many pages as it should have. Too much information for a 115 page book. It should be a 150 page book for all that information."
2,"Okay, needed more good endings","For a ""Choose-your-own-adventure"" book, it was horrible!!! There should have been more ""success endings"" instead of many ""failure-endings""."
1,Not Very Good at all,"Uggh! Out of all the Animorphs-realed books, I'd have to say this is the worst. Sorry, but that's just the way it is. First of all, it skipped like, 10 books. anyone who has never read an Animorphs book would be wondering, ""Who the heck is Ax?"" Secondly, it didn't even give any details to any of the stuff it did tell you. Lastly, you couldn't do anything. In the ""Give Yourself Goosebumps"" books, it would have you choose EVERYTHING. In Alternamorphs, you choose what morphs you make, but that's pretty much about it. All in all, (With no offense to my fav author, K.A.A.,) It stunk. Badly."
5,Cranford,"I am not a Jane Austen- type person but Cranford was very entertaining, funny, touching, and, oh, yes, romantic. The cast was superb. I will probably look for Gaskell's books."
4,BBC love,"I bought this collection for me wife. It took a while to get in the mail, but that is the only complaint I have. Description accurate and merchandise intact. I have to given it to my wife so I don't know if movies work, but if they do, good seller."
5,Great Set!,"These three series tell great stories with wonderful sets/costumes- as you would expect from the BBC. For the price, this set has a lot of content. One note: the Wives and Daughters discs do not have closed captioning."
5,arden quin,"Je connais l oeuvre de Carmelo Arden Quin depuis longtemps et ce livre est une parfaite biographie à la fois pleine humour, de couleurs, et d'anecdotes personnelles. j aime !"
5,"Wonderful, full of color and life","The characters comes alive on the page, each with their own breath of life. If Icould choose any book to have to read on a noisy plane ride, this would be it. Even though I'm too old for some of her books, Pierce still captures my attension and my heart with her wonderful creativity."
4,Almost Perfect,"Ok, I love Tamora Pierce. I read, like, all of her books. This perticular series was great. I thought it was an awsome follow-up to ""The Song of the Lioness."" Trickster's Choice was awsome. It was really the perfect novel. Full of suspense, romance, drama, action, and adventure. But, her second book lacked in some areas. I feel that it was a bit confusing and hard to follow. There was just too many things to remember!"
3,Disappointing,"First let me start off saying that I've always been a huge Tamora Pierce fan. This book (and Trickster's Choice) had a few good moments but at times I couldn't believe it was written by the same person as her other wonderful books.The main character constantly annoyed me because she knew practically everything. Sure, Ms. Pierce had her make a few mistakes to make it seem believable. She was just overly perceptive and put facts together very quickly. No where in the book did it say she was a ""genius"". The book also explained certain connections in great depth. Those connections were usually one's you could make on your own. She made me feel like a child having to be spoonfed answers.I won't give anything away, but the ending was a huge let down and not what you'd expect at all. There was about a 80 page period where I really loved reading the book. Then again there were 444 pages."
3,Not as good as first book,I thought Trickster's choice was an amazing book and I've been waiting since april for trickster's queen to come out. I was very dissapointed with trickster's queen. It was a slow paced book with very little action untill the end. The main character Aly lost her spunk and it was just arelly boring book.
5,classic movies,get it in a bundle good for the season and off season too frosty and rudolph are big hits and they are worth watching for generations to come
3,The Shows: Perfect. Making me sit through 8 minutes of useless previews: Criminal,"Anybody who has ever seen any of the television shows contained in this set knows how cheesily good they are. It's not like I'm giving you information you don't already have. If this set was rated just on the merits of the content, five stars without a doubt.However, making me sit through eight minutes of previews...not even previews...make that eight minutes of ""behind the scenes"" of some completely unrelated cartoon, complete with interviews, is absolutely insulting. I understand that the $5.99 DVD's at Wal-Mart are going to have previews, but even those allow you to bypass them with the menu button. Not here. Fortunately, this is just on the first dvd (Rudolph).Whoever included the forced ""behind the scenes"" preview should be ashamed. This is a nicely boxed, very well executed collection of Christmas television shows, and tacking on a commercial to the front is just insane. How insulting!"
5,Everything OK,"I received exactly the product, size and edition I ordered online, in a perfectly new condition. Very satisfied, totally recommended."
4,"It's cute, really too cute to survive","Quality was fine, it's 2010 and I got it when it came out. I think the battery died a couple of years ago, but it looks fine still. Darn cute plush."
4,Great stuff,"This album continues the excellent American Records tradition. Cash can still get to your bones with that voice and relentless, complex passion.When they talk about American legends, here's the guy."
3,man in black,"what more can be said about johnny cash. this cd only had a couple songs that i didnt have on a different disc. when the man comes around, hung my head and hurt are the best on here. the rest were ok."
5,What if your grandpa's band played NIN at the VFW hall?,"I think this is one of those albums that can change a person's life, if you allow it. Although most songs are not his own, Cash makes them his own through careful, deliberate renditions coming straight from his gut and heart. You are with him the whole way even though it hurts sometimes, but you take it anyway.It sounds like the Man in Black is dying on this record, and that this is farewell. Each song has either goodbyes, death, or the apcolypse as its main subject. Sounds too depressing? Well, it is depressing but it can also be uplifting, in that coming-to-terms-with-mortality way.I can't say enough about this album. I even dare to call it a masterpiece of folk/country music. A must-buy."
2,Not what I expected.,"I have been a Johnny Cash fan for a long time now, and I have to say I am very disappointed in this CD. Johnny Cash is a legend, and this CD makes him sound like a tired old man. NOT the way I want to remember the man in black! ""Bridge over troubled water"" is particularly disturbing to me. Johnny enters the song blurting out, ""When you're weary!"" and I'm thinking to myself, ""I'd say he's weary RIGHT NOW"". Then Fiona Apple appears later in the song and the juxtaposition of the old and the new is like a train wreck. It's like someone said, ""Hey Johnny, before you die could you sing this stuff real quick?"". I do not mean disrespect in any way but saying this. We're all hit and miss. This one, I'd say, is a dramatic miss."
1,How Sad,"I've been a fan of Johhny Cash for over forty years now, listening to and buying his songs from time to time.So, based on the other laudatory reviews, I ordered American IV.I listned to it this afternoon and was very sad, listening to this man whose voice and songs had enthralled me for years struggling to catch enough breath to sing those ragged notes. One of the reviewers sad that he never had much of a voice and thus the ragged pain of this performance was OK. I disagree, Cash had a vibrant moving style that that was deep and gravelly voice that could and did carry the melody faithfully and tell a story with energy and pathos. This was a very sad performance of a man I would rather remember in his prime not in decline at the end of his life. I miss Johnny Cash, but, I'll take a pass on this album."
4,Gift,Got this in a timley manner. My husband has really enjoyed it and we look forward to listening to it for years to come.
5,CASH COMES THROUGH!,"An amazing album by Johnny Cash. Who else could have grandprents and their grandkids gathered around the stereo listening to and enjoying the same artist?That's what Cash has done here. He's covered NIN's ""Hurt"" masterfully; he's covered the Depeche Mode ""Personal Jesus"" anthem artfully...the record is awesome. Cash is awesome. What more can I say?!"
4,As cool as it is moving.,"It's amazing how popular this album became, but that's fine, just more people to love ""Johnny Cash"". This 4th of the ""American Recordings"" albums is as good as the others, though you can hear that his voice is weaker than it was before. His originals here are all excellent as always, especially the title track, however ""American 4"" is also cover heavy. He does the popular ""Nine Inch Nails"" song ""Hurt"", as well as songs by ""Simon And Garfunkel"", ""Sting"", ""Depeche Mode"", ""The Beatles"", and ""The Eagles"". As always, he seems to make each song his own. Overall I actually like ""Unchained"" better, but this and all of his albums are wonderful. It's the sound of cool country."
5,"Incredible raw , honest","This CD is incredible, raw, honest almost painful. It is listening to a master using his talent tempered by his experience. Amazing.Earlier today I had listened to this album and watched the Hurt video. The country music profession should look at the Cash American Albums to learn their roots and where they have recently went wrong. Watched the AMA awards tonight, painful..."
4,whoa,"Definitely a decent peace of music and worth the money......I just don't understand one thing who the heck are eddie arnold and jim reeves mary ann rasuto nobody really cares what you think and if you dont like the album write one review and thats enough. DONT LIKE IT DONT BUY IT simplegreat album the man has made another classic""In My Life"" great song this is worth it right here"
5,"Best CD I've heard in a long, long time","Wow. What else can you say about the final work of this music legend? This album does not have one weak point. It's almost like a narrative of the thoughts that must have gone through Cash's mind in his final days. Most listeners have now heard ""Hurt"" (sure to become a classic), in which he reflects on his own aging process and what he's left behind. But almost never mentioned is the last song, ""We'll Meet Again"" which is especially poignant now that Johnny is no longer with us. It's an ""upbeat"" way to end such an album, and it makes his death a little easier for us to bear."
5,A Great Series of Recordings,"After hearing so many people gush about the Johnny Cash /Rick Rubin American series for several years, I finally got around to giving them a listen. I started with the first one ""American Recordings"". The first listen was a wow moment. A few weeks later I bought the next three ""Unchained"", ""American III: Solitary Man"" and American IV: The Man Comes Around"". I had a long day of data entry to do so I ended up listening to these three CDs in one sitting on head phones. Amazingly I did not get bored with them and the time just flew by.They did everything right on this series, from song selection to what seamed like the unerring production on every track. Be it Johnny with one guitar or a full band it seamed like no mistakes were made. Cash's voice was starting fade a bit on American IV but I found it to be an apt conclusion to his story in music. All four CDs are worth having and I will get American V some time soon.This is a very fitting swansong for Cash."
5,A Quiet and Soulful Farewell,"Tears streamed from my eyes in an unlikely emotional release the first time that I listened to this treasure from an artist whose ""Ring of Fire"" and """"I'll Walk The Line"" had been etched in my memory long ago. This unyielding tremulous soul filled wail of a gifted man consumed with joy, awe, some regrets and the sheer wonder of his life's path is truly a gift to savour.Cash's rendition of ""The First Time That Ever I Saw Your Face"" will bring anyone who has ever had the good fortune to have loved deeply to the very brink of bliss. His ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" is expressive of a uncompromisingly sincere level of wizened, heart felt compassion. ""In My Life"" will rip your heart out.The pathos of it all is heard here; yes, the human condition, the living in it, the dying, the passing and all of our changes. It's in these grooves with all of its fullness and ""We'll Meet Again"" and ""Danny Boy"" will simply leave you limp."
5,First Experience With Jeff Talmadge,"This CD was my first experience with Jeff Talmadge, but not my last.I find him to be a ""storyteller"", much like Harry Chapin, and Bob Dylan, although, perhaps a bit more rock oriented.This is a type of music I like, but it's probably not for everyone. I also bought another CD by him, which is also very good.All in all, if you like story's about life with an up-beat rock sound, you would do well to give Jeff a listen."
3,Good!,"This book is really good for those who want to make their projects open source, or just want to know how to deal with their already done project. There are a lot of advices, examples, practical stuff, etc.But if you already now a lot about open source, this book will teach you new things. But still good for reading and learn deep things about management."
2,Toy,"This item looks ok on the picture here but when I received it and saw it in reality, man I was disappointed. It looks and feels like a mere toy."
2,"Newest ""Baby-sitter"" book fails to reach its potential.","I don't know about everyone else, but it seems that this series just keeps getting worse. This is by far the worst book in the series, and there are several reasons for that.The first is the scare factor. Like The other two sequels, and unlike the origanal, this book fails to be scary. It just doesn't have any erie moments. Also, unlike the other books in this series, this one failed to entertain me altogether. The concept, as well as the characters, is bland.Another factor is credibility. I mean, how many terribly bad baby-sitting jobs can one have. My opinion is by the fourth book in the series, you need a new main character.This book seemed to be quickly thrown together to cash in on the baby-sitter series. This is not the best of Stine's novels, and is by far the worst of the Baby-sitter novels."
5,THE BABY SITTER 4 REVIEW,"I THINK THIS BOOK IS GREAT, I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYBODY WHO LIKE MYSTERY AND LIKES A SCREAM."
1,Doesn't fit VX8300,Does not fit a verizon LG VX8300. Don't waste your time and money. Junk. Very disappointed with both products. Order elsewhere.
2,not for artificial hair,"This shampoo is for both natural hair and artificial hair wigs. I didn't like how it made my wig feel, it was like using regular shampoo. Got something from Sally's that works better"
3,"well-researched, but plodding","Tim Downs showed his colors as a great-storycrafter with his previous two Bug Man novels. In this book he weaves together an incredibly well-researched plot with subtle humor and flair.I'm a big Tim Downs fan and have recommended his previous works to tons of people so I was excited to see his latest offering. However, despite his skill as an author, this book left me flat. It held few surprises (you can guess where everything is going 300 pages from the end), and the most exciting scene in the whole piece was when these guys try to catch a ladder swinging from a boat. No, I'm not kidding.If you like biological or chemical warfare, you'll really get into Plague Maker, but if you're looking for a strong, fast-paced plot, wait for Tim's next book."
4,Swinging in Paris with a pair of Masters,"Master fiddler Staphane Grappelli and electric axman Barney Kessel heat up a Parisian studio in 1969, leading an able, local rhythmn section through standards and Kessel originals. It takes solos this fresh and hot to bring life to tired and overworked tunes like I Got Rhythm,It Don't Mean a Thing... and Honeysuckle Rose. However, this session breathes with life, vitality, and masterful swing improvisation."

3,INTERESTING BUT DULL,"George Plimpton trained and played with the Detroit Lions in 1965 to get a birds eye view of professional football to answer the age old question, Can an armchair QB put his money where his mouth is on the field? The answer is, No. As long as he's in the mix the story flows and is very interesting, but the minute he goes into depth the story drags. GP did something that no writer will probably be allowed to do again in today's liability ridden, prima donna NFL."
4,Non Fiction,"A talented journalist joins the Detroit Lions to get get a greater insight into what it is to be a professional American football player. Some amusing moments because of his ineptitude.This was a top class team dominanting their opponents, so they wangled an agreement that if they got a big enough lead they could put George in as a last string quaterback.Top quality sportswriting work here."
4,Paper Lion,"I think this was a very good book to read. Plimpton achieved his dream and made it so an everyday perosn can realize what it is like to be in the NFL. Though Plimpton was with the Detroit Lion's spring training for 4 weeks and never got to play in an acrual game the book is filled with infromation. This book taught me that back in the 60's life was a lot simplir and the athletes were very laid back. Not like now when athletes are always making head line news and have multi-million dollar contracts. This book is also funny when Plimpton tells side stories that he encountered while with the team. Some of them were a man forgetting his helmat and running on the field and also Plimpton himself trying to practice all by himself. I like the author put the pictures in the middle, it helped to visualize the situation. Overall I think this is a very good book that any football fan will love."
3,It's so bad it's good,"I find Omar's review a bit exaggerated: while his description is accurate (low budget, bad acting, etc.) This is one of those movies of which value is in its cheapness. El Vampiro Teporocho is a movie with very little structure, that has the most ridicule premise: A spanish (of Spain) speaking Dracula is stranded in Mexico City after being put in a rocket by three scientists. After that it's just about surviving 80's Mexico City along with drunk guys, exploiters, and sexy girls.If you can appreciate ""so bad its good"" kind of films, you won't be dissapointed."
1,Worst movie ever,"When I read the description of the movie, it seemed like a funny comedy. It is a bad movie, with bad acting, poor dialogue, low budget. Just reviewing it makes me angry I wasted money and time on this aberration."
5,great player,This is a great saxophonist. I've heard this guy live and it's even more amazing. I'd recommend this cd to anyone who's really interested in jazz. He plays music from his soul in a search for reality. I'm sure we'll be hearing more from Derrick soon.
2,Big Disk lost its Partition Info,"After some months of reliable operation, I powered up my triple interface LaCie Big Disk 500 gb and it had lost all the partition information. Partition Magic and Norton were no help. Since it wasn't my only copy, I didn't lose data, but it sure make me cautious about relying on this disk again. I was using a Dell and an Orange Micro USB2/firewire 400 card. Both interfaces worked equally well before, and neither after losing the partition.I'm not sure I could recommend using this drive in any application that didn't have reliable frequent backups on other media."
2,Not reliable back-up device and poor customer service.,Completely failed after 4 months of light usage as a primary back-up device. Luckly I have all the original data at my main computer. So I called the customer service for the replacement. To my suprise they refuse my request and asked me to download some free HD-recovery software from the internet and tried to fix it by myself. And they said the warranty covers REPAIR ONLY with one way shiping. He promised to email me the RMA # and then no response so far. Looks fancy but this is not reliable hard drive and I will never buy any product from the LaCie again.
2,Very slow response from Customer Support:(,"Note: if you connecting via firewire, that this drive will not work after upgrading to WinXP SP2. Requires a firmware upgrade to even be recognised. Luckily I have a PC running XP SP1 which recognised the HD and was therefore able to upgrade the HD firmware. I found this out by chance, it is now 5 days since I called in with this issue to Lacie's tech support and I still haven't heard back."
5,Lots of beautiful pictures,"The thickness of this volume tells it all. Stuffed with many colourful photos, you will have trouble putting the book down once you start browsing the pages. If you are a visual person, this book will fascinate you."
5,"Indeed, a book lovers book!","Completly original, suspenful and reall, a book lovers book!Inkheart has been my favorite book series since i was eight. Ive cried, laughed out loud and even thrown the book at the wall while reading this.Its a pity that the movie was so awful, i dont recommend it at all. They completly changed the plot and the whole essense of the ""reading out loud"" thing. i was completly appaled and wanted to burn the disk and whoever edited the book into the movie."
3,"So, this book was alright","It was very imaginative, but I was seeking just a little bit more. I wasn't really interested in what was going to happen. It kinda dragged on."
3,Inkheart isn't Thief Lord,"Compared to the Kingdoms and The Elves of The Reach #4 which I read before this, Inkheart wasn't very good. It wasn't what I thought it would be after reading Thief Lord by this author. I would recommend starting with Theif Lord before you read this one. Theif Lord is a much better book."
5,IT WAS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!,I am [...]and i have read tons of books. And i always read them in 2-3 days.But since this book was so good i just had to read on.I almost got in trouble for read while the teacher was talking. Plus i am getting my mom to read it out loud to me and my sister.I wonder if any people will come out.And i am so glad my sister gets to listen because she will never let me read to her any more.But i have a feeling she will like it.But you never know.And i cant wait to go back to the bookstore and get the secound one Inkspell.I cant wait.I hope you enjoy the book.
2,"Sorry, Ms. Funke, but...","I bought this book because my friend said that is was ""amazingly written and a beautiful story-line"". Well, it was just plain BORING! That was THE LONGEST most RAMBLING book ever. She would just go on and on about things I didn't care about! Sorry, Ms. Funke, but I am a major reader and and I found my self watching TV because I was so bored with this book. And, I am not a TV watcher. Don't get me wrong, there were some interesting parts, but they were just too spread out. The down time made me want to hit my head with this book!Did I like it? Not particularly.Do I think this book deserves to be published? Yes, I will give you that. A lot of work went into this and I did like the quotes you put before each chapter (even though they rarely had anything to do with the chapter to me).Sorry, I can tell that you put a lot of effort into this Ms. Funke,but it had more potential."
3,Good... not great,"The book held my attention, and I like the central idea, and I think the writing is solid... but... it moved a bit slow considering the fact that the basic plot is not that complex, the characters are somewhat... flat or stereotypical. This is not always the case for children's literature so I don't think it's about the target audience. It was good... but predictable and a bit slow* plot spoiler * I know the capture/escape/recapture is necessary to introduce some plot elements (the author, the burning of the books)... but it seems pretty clumsy and I wonder if there wasn't a way to tighten it up."
1,Big Dissapointment,"Im 13 and all of these Fantasy adventure books are very appealing to our age group. A vast majority of my friends were reading Inkheart. I bought it and liked the beggining, but soon after it couldn't hold my attention for more than 10 minuets. The plot is boring, and there is about zero action. The characters do not show any change in maturity or any thing else. Its the same story all the way through. No changes in character develpoment and no action. This is why you should not purchase Inkheart or Inkspell. It is a huge waste of money."
3,"Too long, too repetitive","We'd read the first too Funke books, so this was a disappointment. It was way too repetitive. I could probably go thru the entire plot in a paragraph. How many times were the some or all of the main characters captured? It was like a teenage slasher movie - why didn't they just leave?That said, we still enjoyed the book. The reptitiveness and the subsequent length of the book were annoying. But it's still a good story and a great idea. I think she could have done so much more with it."
2,Overrated,"This book came highly recommended, but I'm struggling to finish it. I found the plot is quite slow (escape, get caught, escape again, get caught again) and none of the characters were developed well. I just didn't really care about any of them. The premise of the story is an interesting idea, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Also, I can't see how anyone could compare this book to Harry Potter or LOTR."
2,A blot on Inkheart,"I loved Ms. Funke's previous work the Thief Lord (although the ending was somewhat abrupt) and that is what led me to this book. Given that she demonstrated a fine ability to craft likable and believable characters in her earlier work, I am going to have to attribute this horribly stilted and pedantic piece to the work of the translator. I tried many times to plough through this story but kept getting turned off by how trite and one dimensional the characters seemed and how stilted the dialogue was. The idea is a magnificent one but it cant get out because of how poorly this was done. The only other example of ruining a perfectly good story with atrocious dialoge that comes to mind is Lucas's final three films. The concepts are lofty and the vision is there but the actors deliver their lines without any feeling. Sorry Ms. Funke -- you flunked."
3,"interesting concept, but...","So as someone who has often found myself sucked into a good book and unable to surface until the story was complete, the idea of someone who could read characters out of a book was fascinating to me. Unfortunately, just a good idea does not a good story make. I found the characters in this book flat. The bad guys' worst action was to kidnap our heroes and burn down a library. Meggie was constantly whining. Her father was unnecessarily secretive. The comic relief was more tragic than comic. All in all, the book wasn't horrible but I wouldn't recommend it either."
1,STORY STEALER,"Cornelia Funke stole the idea of Inkheart from Carlos Ruiz Zafon's The Shadow of Wind. And her rendition of Zafon's book sucked. I couldn't read after page 100. She disgraces Zafon, and The Shadow of the Wind is an awesome book. When rewriting a book that is already written, the point is to mak it either a) as good or b) better. Funke has achieved neither, and it would make any true reader angry."
1,One of the most boring books I've ever read,"This book was recomended to me, and it seemed interesting enough from the plot summary, but then I started actually reading it. I tried to like this book...really I did. I kept reading farther just in the dire hope that it would pick up and be a bit more interesting and it just never did. Maybe something was lost in translation, but it's longwinded about absolutely nothing, all the characters are dry and often times downright annoying, and it's descriptions of people and places are horrid. Being a book about books, it mentions them a lot, to the point of of being annoying. Reading it I was constantly thinking to myself ""OK, I get the point, they like books!!! You dont have to tell us 5 times a page."" The main bad guy was supposed to be the most evil person in existance and was straight forwardly described as such over and over and over ad nauseum, and just....wasnt. Many parts are painfully predictable, and over all the book just falls flat."
3,Bad guys are really only fictional?,"Written in the same mood as James Thurber's dark stories ""The Wonderful O"" and ""The Thirteen Clocks"" (but much much longer), this is an engrossing fantasy, but I'm not sure I really like it. Young readers may be titillated by the bad guys' threats of mutilation (and the hint of rape), but for me as a grownup even the characters who were not fictional seemed one-dimensional. The adult women were tiresome cliches: the bloodthirsty crone, the blue-stocking spinster, the virtuous but powerless mother. Only the virginal prepubescent girl can conquer evil.I'm sure this fantasy is a great hit in its native Germany. It reassures young readers that Fascists are not really people from our world, but are fictional characters who ended up here by mistake. Right.Take away the magic elements and here's the setting: the Black Shirts take over an Italian village and control the area by terror. Everyone is too frightened to resist them. Couldn't be true, could it?"
5,Starts so but gets better,This was a wonderful book. It does start off so but wait it does get better. Once I got into the book it was hard to put down.
3,enjoyable fantasy,"Inkheart is fun to read, an imaginative story line, however it is more a story for young adolescences. A quick read"
4,Inkheart,"Inkheart, by Cornelia Funke, is the prequel to Inkspell another well writen book by Funke. This fantasy book is very suspensful and engrossing. Inkheart is a book like a fantasy, adventure, and mystery all in one.One night when Meggie's dad, Mo, reads aloud from Inkheart, an evil ruler escapes out of the book and lands in their living room. Capricorn, the evil ruler , escapes to a village to start his kingdom as Meggie goes with Mo to one of his friends who needs their books refurbished, something mysterious happens."
4,Not To Much Info If You Want a Summery!,"InkHeart is about a girl named Meggie. One dark and stormy night when Meggie can't sleep she sees someone out in the rain and calls for her father Mo who then invites the man in. The man refers to Mo as Silvertounge and Mo refers to the man as Dustfinger. While Meggie spys on the mysterious man and her father she learns of a man named Capricorn who wants Mo to do something for him, the next morning Meggie and Mo flee to Meggie's mother's aunt: Elinor. Meggie's mother had to go away when Meggie was young but Mo is sure she is not dead. While on their stay at Elinor's, Dustfinger shows Meggie his fasinating trade of fire. But bad things happen too, Mo is captured by Capricorn's men...And the story goes on from there!"
1,A Book About Books???,I just couldn't get though it. This book just didn't keep me interested. I mean a book about books????? I don't know...
1,Disappointment,I placed an ordered for a hard back book I received a paper back copy. I am not impressed or happy.
2,Poor Picture Quality,"I've bought about a dozen Warner Archive made-on-demand discs. The quality of the film transfer is excellent on all of them except for ""Betrayed."" The picture in ""Betrayed"" is soft and blurry throughout, about equivalent to a good VHS tape.I also question the aspect ratio of this transfer. Warner's listing for this disc at wbshop.com says, ""Screen Aspect: 4 X 3 FULL FRAME."" That would be a ratio of 1.37 : 1. And 4 x 3 is indeed what appears on my screen when I project this disc. But imdb.com cites an aspect ratio of 1.66 : 1. If so, part of the image is cut off on this disc."
3,Rare Vintage Record on CD,"Japan has been releasing vintage Hawaiian albums from the U.S.'s mid-century yesteryears. The Mary Kaye Trio is one of them. The album is more mainlader in feel than traditional Hawaiian and sounds a little dated, its still a fun listen for vintage lounge lovers. It is a little cheesey, but after all it is from that era and it is a rare release on CD."
5,Size and function . . .,"These jewel cases are compact and durable (considering how easily most CD cases break). Two packs of these can hold CDs from a 50-spindle pack. They're great space-savers. One warning: they are so thin, that if you're looking for jewel cases to replace broken ones for music or video games, you won't have space for the booklets (music lyrics or video game instructions). I tried to use some cases for my old video game CDs and they don't shut properly with the booklets inside. Most of the thinner inserts will fit, though. As far as using them for spindle CDs, I will definitely buy more of these."
2,3 out of 25 were broken,"Cases are fine, but 3 of the 25 in the pack were broken at the hinge that connects the front & back covers. That is a bit too high a percentage..."
1,Wireless extender YX510-PCS-CEL,Tried this product and did not see any benefit to it. I had the same cell signal with or without the unit installed. I tried it in several locations in and around my house with no change in reception quality.
3,It drops calls,I have found that if one caller is on line and another caller dials out it will knock the first off this booster. It doesn't happen all the time but enough to drive you crazy. Will have to try different locations for the main antenna and the location of the booster box. Jury is still out if this was worth the strong price.
1,doesn't work,"I have tried the product various times in many locations and it does not work as advertised. I am very dissappointed. If I go to the roof of my house, I can make cell calls, yet when I put the antenna on the roof, it does not improve the calls."
1,Going to need a bigger boat!,"It's funny, I read the reviews and people are either very happy and very unhappy with this product. This install was for our cottage where we have limited cell coverage with AT&T. Sometimes we get a very good signal according to our phones yet we're unable to place/receive calls. Other times we're showing less signal but are able to place/receive calls. Not sure the reason. The antennae is on the roof, extended with a pvc pipe 12' above and 25' above the receiver. If it were our home we definitely would have returned it but since it's for cottage it's less of a priority. Good luck!"
2,This item performs poorly,"I'm and electrical engineer. I followed the installation instructions carefully using only the included equipment. And I was careful to get adequate separation between the unit and the external antenna. Even the diagnostics on the unit itself indicate that it should be a good installation. But the unit only works off and on with the result that calls fade in and out - even if you aren't moving around the house. It happens if you are sitting right next to the unit. The call quality ends up not being improved.I called customer service while trying to debug it and they told me that that you can't tell anything from the flashing lights on the front of the unit. That flashing or not flashing was all normal. From this I concluded that all of their units have problems and only work intermittently.I may have a faulty unit, but I just wouldn't recommend this item. It is a lot of money and doesn't very well."
2,Not very good.,"This product didn't work well. It had virtually no range, or signal improvement. i returned it and changed cell providers: much better and cheaper results."
3,Works to a point,"The product works, but it has limitations. Antenna placement is an important key, and so is the location of the base station. You really need to experiment with the placement of both to get your best results. This is spelled out in the instructions and I found no misstatements.We were able to obtain four bars of phone reception in the attic, and after installation, four bars were available near the base station. There is a substantial fall-off as you move your phone away from the base. Our house is slightly over 4000 square feet. In the most distant rooms, there was no apparent effect. But for most of the house, at least one addition reception bar was realized. It isn't perfect, but it has value."
1,Not satisfied.,"Everything came in the box as promised...however, I was not able to make it work worth the investment.We had a sporadic 1bar reading before the use of the boost. Afterwards we had a sporadic 5bar...but it would go down to no bars and still drop calls. So we returned it...I am sure it could work for some situations, but for ours it didnt work.The return was easy and I received the full refund...so no hassle and no loss other than $7 for return shipping."
1,Don't waste your money!,"We had high hopes for this expensive little wall hanging but alas they were to be dashed on the rocks of wasted money. We live out in the country and can get 1 bar at the end of our home. We can even get one bar in the living room by our window, as can our friends and family so we were sure this booster would help us and ordered it. Well it has not helped at all. You may get a few bars but it doesnt' hold the signal long enough for you to call out much less complete a call.This is a lot of money to not work at all, and they make grand claims that if you can get 1 bar then they can boost your signal. Sad to say it didn't work in our neck of the woods."
2,"What should be simple, is complex, and doesn't work very well.","I have tried placing this in 4 different places in our new custom home. It doesn't work well. I can barely get good reception in the same room, and virtually no reception outside of the room. I can step outside of the house, get 5 bars and have virtually flawless reception. Tech support made some recommendations that I am in the process of trying out but having no success so far."
5,"A ""should have"" product","if you have call drops, this product is for you.I am really happy with the result. I have at least 2 bars now, in a basement where I never got one bar."
2,Works with Sprint Blackberry but does not work with my iPhone,"I bought this for my apartment in Chicago where reception for both Sprint and AT&T; is poor, however it is not working as advertised/I had hoped. The unit seems to be working perfectly for my Sprint Blackberry 8830 but my iPhone 3G reception has actually gotten worse since setting it up. Where I used to be able to get 3G sporadically by a couple windows I can now only get edge reception and even that fades out.Fortunately I have my other phone... otherwise if I only had the iPhone I would say this is a complete waste of money."
4,Great! Really does help,"This really did help the cell phone signal in the house, but you really need to get the bigger antenna"
2,Unfulfilled Expectations,I get more bars on my phone but it doesn't seem to keep the signal going through the call. I still have to go to the window. I doubtthat I'd buy it again.
1,Please dont waste your money,I purchased the zBoost YX-510 cell phone signal booster in august 2010 and followed the instructions exactly and have not detected any improvement at all in the number of dropped calls or the quality and/or lack of signal quality.This is one of the only reviews that I have ever done.this was a complete waste of money.
1,Save your money...,"I've had this item for 11 months now. My home is only just over 1300 sq ft so we weren't asking a lot. We got it heading into winter (no leaves on the trees) and felt like we were seeing a bit of improvement where a bit was absolutely necessary. By spring, we had a more complete opinion and not a good one. Now, after 11 months, it is completely on the fritz and I'm trying to get it returned or, oh boy, replaced."
3,It works,"The device works, but if you do not have more than one bar of signal anywhere in your location, then it can't work miracles. Living in a condo, there is no way to put the antenna on the roof or attic so it does not help me much with signal.You have to connect the antenna to the device with a coax cable and that is hard to hide in a small home, so that is another draw back. I guess it would have been nice to know about the long antenna cable before I purchased it."
4,Tracy,"Works very well. Before I barley had a signal in the house(maybe 1 bar at most) Now I have at least 3 anywhere in the house. It is a 1 level(ranch style) Anywhere within 15 ft of the unit I have 5 bars. Thanks, I would recommend this to everyone that has this problem. I mounted this on my old aerial tripod on the roof on 8ft piece of 1 1/2 in. PVC."
1,Corny,Lay Z&BoringYonce doing this weak re-make of 2Pac's cut. this cut is so boring&Predictable.the video is cool though.I never really cared for Lay Z's Flow.Beyonce is a dime a dozen Artist as well.
2,sent me an old battery,"Seller (it did not come from Casio directly) was fast to ship and the battery was exactly what I needed, however, the battery was already very old because it does not hold a charge for two weeks without getting a low battery signal. And this is just with a few pictures taken. This battery is actually worse than the one I was replacing."
4,It's a Battery,"First Impression: Well, it's a battery.Usage: Works well. Holds the charge like it's supposed to. For the most part, I've gotten to about 150-200 pictures per charge. It should be of note that I almost always leave the screen on, and I have a habit of leaving the camera on when I'm not using it. No problems so far.Overall: Nothing too special. This is a battery for an older camera, so if any of your friends has a battery/camera that lasts longer per charge than you, just take that into account. It works well, but as I've said twice now -- it's a battery."
4,long lasting,"This is a spare battery, but you might not need it. The original battery last a good long time, but if you are going to be away from a charger for a while, these are a good idea."
2,"Good concept, needs better execution","Being able to keep an eye on your bacon so you don't overcook it is a great way to protect your daily floppy rations from being consumed by the unwashed masses who think bacon is supposed to be crispy. Having said that, I have two complaints with this product:1) The glass is highly susceptible to temperature shock, and is thus prone to cracking.2) If you're not actively purging the grease from the pan, some of it will get on top of the glass and get under the plastic handle, leaving visible grease deposits which don't come out in the dishwasher -- you need to get a screwdriver and remove the handle from the glass to clean it out.So, alas, my wife will continue to benefit from my short attention span while cooking my morning bacon, at least until someone can invent transparent cast iron."
2,Not so much,"I didn't really like this much. I hated that made such a mess. If you don't use a big enough skillet, it won't press down enough and when you do the grease transitions to the top of the press and makes a mess. Also, after only using it a few times, it broke into pieces on top of my bacon. I would recommend a cast iron press with slots in it."
1,Glass breaks too soon,"Isn't there some type of plastic that this could be made of? Silicone? It's such a neat idea to be able to see your bacon right through the press, but it just isn't tough enough."
5,the miracle of flowers,this is the very best book on the subject you'll ever find. Beautiful pictures and accurate/scientific explanations about how this wonder is the possible in such a short time. The writer is passionate and you can feel through the multiple explanations he gives that this is a life passion he puts into words. Magnificent !
4,A good book,I thought this was a good book. Gave me all the information I needed about how to set up a concierge service and basic business set up. I thought it was good and very helpful.
2,lightweight introduction,"I agree with other reviewers, this is a handy little book if you've never been in business before and want a general introduction.However, given the title, it's logical that most people who buy this book are not looking for a guide to small business generally, but want the lowdown on how to run a concierge service. Unfortunately, Katharine doesn't give much away. I can't help feeling that this is deliberate - if you really want to know how to run a concierge service, she wants you to use her consultancy services.If you are serious about going into business, you will need a lot more information than is contained in this book, and you probably don't have a bottomless budget. Get yourself a good book about starting and running a business (Amazon.com has several) and a good book about concierge work, and you can save yourself the money on this one."
4,UDT diver,"Waterman tells his autobiographical story in such a modest manner, it is easy to forget how brave he is. A member of the Underwater Demolition Teams that were a precursor to NAvy Seals, he did things few in the world can claim. This book is full of personal and factual info on his UDT experiances. But it is also a tale of his experoiances as an underwater cameraman, salvage operator, and commercial diver. Very intersting book, good photos even in the paperback. Highly reccommend for those interested in this subject!!"
5,All wrapped up into one!,"I checked this book out of the library and found myself taking it out for an extra 2 weeks until the one that I ordered came in! I would recommend everybody to go out and buy this book! It has made my life in cooking so much easier. I must own about 25 different ones either for different recipies in each, or just for the basics that are spread out amongst them all. With this ONE book, I can get rid of my others. It is the only one that you need for all your information wrapped up into one. The pictures really help me get a quick sense of the recipe, its steps, ingredients, and the time involved. Thank you so much Good Housekeeping!!!"
3,CLASSIC MOVIE/DECEIVING ADVERTISING,I AM TRYING TO GET A COLLECTION OF CLASSIC DISNEY MOVIES TOGETHER FOR MY GIRLS. I WANT BLURAY DVDS THOUGH AND THIS DVD IS NOT BLURAY. THE ADVERTISING ON TOP THAT DAYS 2-DISC GIVES THAT IMPRESSION. A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE WAS NO BLURAY.
2,BEASTLY!,THE TRACKING WAS OFF QUE CAUSING THE TAPE NOT TO MATCH UP WITH THE CHARACTER'S MOUTH MOVEMENTS; I CLEANED THE VCR AND IT STILL PERSISTED.
5,Amazon needs to fix their product reviews...,"I spotted this pre-order and since this is my favorite Disney movie I was instantly interested. Many studios have botched blu-ray releases pretty bad. So I scrolled down to look at the comments of others. This product will not be released until October 2010. Instead of a discussion of the pros and cons of blu-ray I find 8-9 year old reviews of the DVD and totally inappropriate (for this product) reviews of Amazon Marketplace orders for the DVD. All of this needs to be removed.It is good to see that Disney is not only offering this fan favorite on blu-ray with DVD, but is including extras. I give this 5 stars based on the writeup for the 3-disc blu-ray combo pack and my love of this movie. I will update my review in October with an actual description of the product once I have it."
4,"Great Movie, But Hard To Find Makes Expensive","This is a Disney movie that is a must have, and if you can't wait until 2010 when it's re-released(including on Blu-Ray), then it is worth the money."
5,Beauty and the Beast,"With a second disc chock full of extras, this DVD is well worth the price. Not to mention three, yes three, versions of the film. One can see interviews with the voices, the animators, and the producers. There are also games for everyone. And the movie, well, it is brilliant. Not just a kiddie cartoon, it is enjoyable for everyone. If only we could all live by the message behind this movie..."
3,Diamond Edtion Review,Orange! Everything is really orange in this new Diamond Edition. The colors are really too bright. The original edition is much much better.
3,here is the problem,"Beauty and the Beast is an excellent movie, a Disney classic and one of my all time favorites. So why did they have to add a scene?? The DVD version is weakened by the added scene in which the houseware characters sing, ""Human Again."" The problem with this scene begins with the fact that it is not needed, add to that the color in the animation is different from that of the rest of the film and it just seems so completely out of place. To me the added scene seems uncomfortable. The bottom line is that it is a great movie, but the added scene brings it from a 5 to a 3 star rating!!!"
1,BLOATED BLU_RAY WON'T LOAD,When will the movie studios learn? We don't want DVDs loaded up with crap - we just want to watch the movie. Takes forever to load on a brand new Blu-Ray player. Disney FAIL
1,Bad shape,"This movie is in very bad shape, scratched and has no subtitles. We can not see it.Please check with your provider"
1,received dvd scartched and dvd holder was broken,This product was listed as new on AMAZON but it was far from new the snaps to hold the CDs were broken and the dvd were scratched up from lots of ware and tear. i do not recomment buying from this vendor at all.....i know i won't
2,Item no what I expected.,The item was a burned copy and the cover was a copy as well. Not to pleased with the product.
1,AN ILLEGAL COPY OF MOVIE THAT DOESN'T WORK!!!!!!,I received the movie and wrapped it of my 4 year old daughter. Christmas morning we tried to watch it and it was a blank cd. It had been illegally copied and the pictures on disc had been professionally done ? But when you take a closer look it is obvious it is a copy! This seller is horrible!
5,A breathtaking blu-ray.,"The Blu-ray comes with a DVD, which is quite convenient, so watching it in High-def, which is noticeable, or just watching it is very simple. The definition in blu-ray is simply amazing, it's beautiful. You won't regret buying this because it's a timeless classic that you can enjoy over and over again, with family, or by yourself. It has a bunch of interesting documentaries, and fun games, and bonus features, you will never get tired of this Blu-ray. Disney's Diamond collection is off to a great start."
5,I was surprise!!!!!!!!,"I order this movie, and How to train your dragon, for my granddaughter as a Chritsmas present. They came on time.I enjoyed watching this two movies withmy granddaughter.I bought other movies before and I had a good service.I give 5 stars to all.Keep the good work!!! Thank You to all!!Lydia"
4,On time,"I got this for my grandchildren for Christmas. I could not find a good price on this locally so I ordered, late, from amazon. Was not expecting it in time to put in the stockings. Surprise! They had it Christmas morning. I am very pleased with service and the girls watch the movie often."
5,Nver bettered,"The only Disney movie ever to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and it shows. There's something elusive that seperates this apart from the rest, maybe it's the perefectly developed characters, or the songs, but it's probably becuase this is still the only Disney film ever to teach you anything to live your life by; that true beauty lies within.The storytelling flows so seamlessly, and the humour is universal, unlike the obnoxious comedy of Hercules and the Eperor's New Groove. I'll admit as a child films like Dumbo and Sleeping Beauty (yes, even the extremely over-rated Bambi) left no effect on me, but from the moement the amazingly 3D castle pokes out from behind the trees to the beautiful stained glass window eneding, this movie captures your immagination and doesen't let go.Timeless. Truly, Disney's greatest acchievment."
3,classic,"i tried to give it 5 stars but the page is giving me trouble. The movie is my all time favorite disney movie, but it's so not worth it if it's not the original disney dvd...not to mention selling copies are pretty illegal"
5,Purchase of DVD,I received my purchase in a timely fashion and it arrived in excellent condition. I would buy from this vendor again
2,Something's wrong here,"Neither our Blu-Ray now our DVD player will play this DVD without ""Angle On"" and ""Angle Off"" appearing repeatedly in the upper left hand corner of the screen. I have never seen this with any other DVD I have ever watched. Seller denied that it was a bootleg copy, but I'm pretty sure it is. Other than the above annoyance, the movie itself is ok, but agree with some others that the colors do not seem quite right. Dull and washed out come to mind."
3,Not a genuine copy,"I was unaware from the description that I would not be getting a genuine copy of this movie. The quality is fine but it's not an original. Had I known, I would have searched a little more and bought a more expensive original copy."
5,One of my all time favorites,"This is up there for the best Disney movie. The animation is astounding, the music, perfect. Its an unforgettable classic that everybody should watch, if they have yet to do so."
2,3 Discs? Give me a break...,"This product is a bunch of extra padding in order to explain its exorbitant price.Its the entire 2-Disc DVD edition packed in with the single disc Blu Ray to avoid any extra (heaven forbid) production effort. 1 Blu-Ray could effortless hold all of this, but instead we get a sub par set filled with tons of SD featurettes -- just so they can say ""3 discs"" and justify the high price. This is not in the spirit of Blu-Ray, and makes the product come off as cheaply inflated. Quality products justify their price, but throwing excess plastic at us is not the way to do it."
4,Beauty & The Beast,"Was a little disappointed that cover slip was missing and the cover was a little scratched. DVD in good shape, and that's what I REALLY cared most about."
5,DVD Beauty & The Beast,Fabulous DVD and it prepared our almost 3 year old great grandaughter with a sense of the music and the Cast before we took her to see a performanceput on by the local Arts & Culture Centers Youth Group in our community. It was a long but wonderful stage performance by all 70 members of the cast.Thank you for enabling us to purchase and receive in a most timely manner this DVD.
1,Disney Beauty and the beast,This DVD (Beauty and the Beast) will not play. I ordered 5 DVD's at the same time and all worked except this one. Not sure why it was shipped from England and do not know if that is why it will not work. Have tried several times with no luck
1,Terrible Customer Service,When I oreder this DVD I thought I owuld have a gift for my wife in time for her birthday. I even e-mailed this person to ask if I could pay additional fees fro a faster mailing service. The e-mail was returned. I went to the store front for this individual and it was closed. Amazon stood beside thier policy and refunded my money. After that the DVD cam in 10 days late. I had already ordered another DVD. I have it now unopened If you want the DVD back say so. I do not need it.
3,"Great movie, but.....","Does anyone else find it disturbing that the ""beautiful"" witch turned a little boy (albeit selfish) into a monster? If you'll listen to the song ""Be Our Guest"", you will find out that they've been rusting in the castle for ten years. And considering that the magical rose withers completely on his 21st birthday, I find it unbelievable that anyone could justify the actions of the beautiful witch....who had nothing better to do with her time than pick on an 11 year old boy."
1,Why? OH Why?,Dvd was ruined... Every other review can fill in the blanks on that. Not as good as Classic Disney Films. (i.e. films made before 1980) Still better than films made after Aladin. (i.e. Nemo/Lion king a.k.a Kimba the White Lion from Japan)Animation 7/10 original.... 3/10 DVDSound 10/10 Original.....3/10 DVDReplay Value 5/10 Original..... 1/20 DVDStory 6/10Overall 7/10 Original....... 3/10 DVD
5,b and b,"I love Beauty and the Beast, it is such a great story and the animation is wonderful. This is my fave Disney movie!! I love the new music number and over all i think this movie rocks!!!"
3,seller's lack of availability,"I have tried contacting this seller on numerous occasions and I haven't received one response back. I'm sending general, basic questions and the seller is ignoring my emails. It is quite frustrating to know that your attempts to contact someone you've engaged into business with is all for nothing. Personally, I would advise anyone contemplating doing business with this seller not to do so. His/her lack of customer service is unprofessional and an irritating inconvenience."
2,Where's the Fire,"I was so disappointed with this CD that I bought a different Holst ""Planets"" CD. Zubin Mehta decided to rush through my favorite part of ""Jupiter"". The cello (I think) section should be slow and deliberate. The jolly clown is having a pensive moment. This part should be chewed finely and savored. Rushing through it ruins the piece. The rest is not exactly great, either."
4,John Williams Owes Holst Big-time,"Give a listen to The Planets, and you'll recognize the phrases and melodies and arrangement style that became Star Wars in John Williams' able hands."
4,mulligans,A cool refreshing new gay dvd that entails a man who is gay and marries a woman right out of high school only to much later on in life persue his gayness. Cool!!
4,Great Movie,Mulligans is a great movie! This movie shows the struggles two men had with their sexuality. The struggles and events that unfold were realistic and you could see and feel the heartache of the characters. The characters are very attractive and I really enjoyed how the intimacy was clean and tastefully portrayed.
5,Additional tracklist info for this Classic Masterpiece,Title song 'Dances Of Death' is an eight-piece song:I. Introduction (instrumental)II. Eruption (instrumental)III. Beyond The GatesIV. Outburst (instrumental)V. Days Of BetrayalVI. Restless (instrumental)VII. SanctuaryVIII. Finale (instrumental)The whole album is about 40 minutes long.
5,Could it be even heavier?,Yes I think S.Y.L. have gotten even heavier. This is one sick cd and is some of Devin townsend's best work. Devour is by far my favorite song but I love 'em all. This cd will put you in a blender with all this grinding hardcore metal. If you haven't bought a strapping young lad cd let this be your first. S.Y.L. are redifining hardcore so why don't you be a part of it?
1,Not Funny,"I came across this book out of the blue and had hopes it would tell me something useful about a serious problem. The author, a practicing psychiatrist, seems to think he must be cute in describing his cases, giving them unfunny titles like ""Bipolar, Sell High."" His humor is misplaced and his tendency to think all problems are bipolar gets tiresome after a while. Those looking for insight and understanding are bound to be disappointed, and those wanting to laugh should consult a comedian rather than a psychiatrist."
1,Skip this one,"A previous review says that the book doesn't fulfill the promise of the early chapters, I read the first twelve and am already dissapointed. Some reviewers have said the book is worthwhile for pointing out the gospels are probably not news reports but have some fictional elements. ""Big deal!""...any observant person can figure this out. Mailer's portrayal looks to be as biased as any other biographer has been, except he's gaudy enough to write it as autobiography. The Jesus here is a boring, flat character. I wanted to discover a compelling leader, I met someone a good deal less interesting and powerful than some of my friends. Mailer could have done so much more with this book. The only redeeming quality is his portrayal of Satan and some of the other characters who get less attention in other writings. Nothing could be worse, or less true, than a Jesus no one was interested in or concerned about, which was how reading this book made me feel."
2,When a good idea goes bad...,"I had heard ravings about Norman Mailer and the controversy around his books for so long, that I finally felt I had to read something of his just to feel like I wasn't missing the boat. Well, I don't know if I just picked the wrong one or what, but I do not understand what all the fuss is about.The Gospel According to the Sonis a self-proclaimed autobiographical story of Jesus' life. There have been tremendous arguments about the validity, taste, and appropriateness of the story. The controversy alone made me want to read it. The controversy may have made for good reading; the book did not. Mailer's writing style was not to my taste at all. The book felt contrived, like he was deliberately trying to provoke rather than story-tell. Now, admittedly, he may have been - in which case he was successful in his own goal. But even so, to me as a reader, that resulted in a very unsatisfying reading experience."
2,Mixing lies with the truth...,...Norman Mailer seems to understand Satan better than any other character in this book.
2,Doubting Jesus,"Mailer was on to something when he decided to write the story of Jesus from Jesus' perspective. But more often than not, I think he missed the boat. The characters have no depth, the book is a light weight read. He could have doubled the length of the book, slowed down and given more consideration to his characters and the book would have been better for it. What did I like? I liked that Jesus doubted the value of his followers, I liked that he wasn't ""attached"" to his mother, I liked that he saw that comfort in religion begets apathy and greed, I liked that he saw his followers taking liberties by exaggerating his life and miracles, and I liked that Jesus doubted his own commitment to his Father."
4,A Winter Haunting,"Great book with incredible imagery. There are many pages that will make you think twice about that darkness outside your door, the farm down the street and going upstairs. The plot remains thick and twisting the whole way through. Good read."
2,Inferior Simmons,"I love Dan Simmons (especially the Hyperion books), but this one didn't work for me. He's a talented writer, and the book moves, but the whole haunting thing has been done soooooo many times that it really takes a fresh idea to make it worthwhile to read another book like this. This ain't it. I admire him for trying to write about a thoroughly damaged (and unsympathetic) main character. At the same time, I didn't like the character at all, which makes it hard to like a book like this. Full disclosure: I read Summer of Night, and didn't particularly like that either."
3,"Good Story, questionable writing","It took me several days to determine if I liked this book after I read it. I was looking for a good Haunted House Book. The story is very good, but Dan Simmons failed to pull me into the story. At times it read like a screenplay. All though visually descriptive, it was not frightening. I found the jumping back and forth to past and present tedious at times. I also thought some of the content was more ""filler"" than a smooth continuation of the story.The story was a wonderful glimpse into the life of a severely depressed person and his journey to find a reason for life. The ending was a surprise, and I enjoyed it. This is not a wonderful book, but it is a quick read and had lots of interesting ghosts, it is worth picking up ."
3,A Cool Reception,A talented writer goes thru the motions and leaves us unmoved and unsatisfied. A revisit to earlier places without most of the characters who made it interesting. I await the next work.
5,Ever hear of the Tain Bo Culainge,"The Tain Bo Culainge (Cattle raid of Cooley) often simply called the Tain, is the greatest story of the Cycle of the Red Branch Knights, a noble cycle of poems from ancient Ireland. It told the tales of the Celtic knights and their brave battles with human foe and with non- humans as well. This book is the tale of the Tain told from an interesting point of view, a potential mate of Maeve of Connaught who cannot be corn king because he crashes his sportscar (or the local version anyway - his chariot). It is a good rendition of the story and well worth a read. If you don't think you like ancient irish mythology, then forget all the above - all you need to know is that it's a brilliant and exciting story. You will want to read the sequel afterwards -the crow goddess."
2,NEEDUM PICTURES!!!,"Ah, fourty-five self defense moves. Shame that there are only thirteen pictures in it! OK, the book had some good concepts, and I'm sure that most of the self-defense lessons are servicable. However, the lack of photos is more than disappointing. I did like the fact that after every lesson, there was a ""Concepts to Learn"" portion. I'd like to see that in more books like this. In the beggining of the book, concepts, basic striking tools, and stances are covered, though not very well. Many of the terms used in the book are not explained well, or sometimes not at all, and this makes reading difficult. It's an OK book for a martial artist to use, mostly to incorporate into his self-defense studies, and also gives some insight into San Soo, but in that respect is by no means complete. It's a little useful, but may not be worth the price."
1,miniair,This product appeared to be larger than it turned ou to be. It worked well but was way too small for the room. We had previously had a much larger unit. This would work in a newborn's room. Nothing larger. Brucklaw12
2,commentsathushdotcom,"This reviewer (see above) is ignorant of all facts aboutany air purifier. Read Consumer Reports, October 2003 for allfacts and information prior to buying a unit."
2,Noisy,Even low speed is louder than the Holmes I replaced. You can forget about anything higher if you're using it in a bedroom. Some have compared the noise to a window air conditioner. I think my AC is quieter than this.
4,A bit loud but picks a lot of dust from air,"I purchased two air purifier from Amazon and eventually decided to return one of them. This is the one I decided to keep.The other one (bigger one from Honeywell turns out to be too loud.) This one's noise is about right for my home. Still you can't leave it on and listen to music/watch TV in the same time. But if you stand away far enough, its noise is tolerable.It is completely passive,doesn't generate ozone. I think it is safe for us."
4,Great but newer model available,"I'm new at air purifiers. Bought an Orek and returned it 3 days later after also buying this model for $100 at Target. It cleaned up somethning in the air immediately that helped my allergies a lot and this is not wishful thinking. I ordered two of the newer models on Amazon, 17005, because it has a timer and remote. These machines are noisy but they pump a lot of air and with the timer we can set the two that we will be getting to turn on full blast while we are sleeping. Other air cleaners have higher ratings but cost 4-6 times more. I am going by my personal experience and think that two in our medium sized master bedroom will continue to do even better than the one we have now. (duh :-)The 17005 is $120 on Amazon. Good luck.P.S. It pulls cat hair out of the air quite well. I had to clean the pre-filter after one day. I would give it a 5 but I'm no expert and maybe there is even something better, but I don't think so."
2,So/So,The delivery and payment were ideal but the product is just so/so. Last year I purchased a fan from Sams with the ION module and it works wonders... Cost about $40 compared to this - I should have gone back to Sams
4,"A review by two sisters, ages 11 and 13",This is the Dad typing the dauhgters' dictated review:Emma: The last three in this series were the best.Sophie: These books are really fun to read together.Emma: We liked it a lot.Sophie: Sammy is a really interesting person. It's fun to read.
5,Great short story,If you've read the trilogy you must read this. If i'd known about it I would have read it first..
1,Lyra's Oxford,i purchased the entire series for my brand new Kindle. When i got to this book i was very excited.In less than an hour i was livid.To much $$ for so little content!!!
2,A bit of fun but not for serious HDM readers,"The story of 'Lyra and the birds' is fairly well written and does explain more about Lyras life after saying goodbye to Will. Unfortunately, though it is not particularly bad, it doesn't live up to the expectations readers of the His Dark Materials trilogy will have. It is simply a short story with a rough, vague ending. Most people reading the other books in the series will no doubt be good at reading (as they can be tough going sometimes)and this addition seems almost patronising.An ok book overall but if you wish to keep your opinions of Lyra and Will as they are left in the last book then I would discourage you from spending this much money."
5,Could this little book be leading to something more???,"As an avid lover of the Dark Materials, I was excited to see this book on the shelf. I picked it up immediatley.I have to admit, yes the book is short, containing a story of approx. 49 pages. It is a quick read and not to the depth of the Dark Materials trilogy... HOWEVER, upon reading the introduction this leads me to believe there is something more on the horizon (or at least I'm hoping so). I believe that anyone who is a fan of the Dark Materials will enjoy this little tid bit for what it is. It takes place after the trilogy and shows how life has gone on for Lyra and Pan. It leads me to the conclusion that more is to come...Pullman is a delightful writer. His words are wonderful and picturesque. I highly recommend this to any fan of The Dark Materials."
4,quite... small,"even at the discounted price, the book still felt quite small, relative to cost. however, it is indeed necessary for all fans of his dark materials. while the story is ... small, the included materials do give us hope for the upcoming book of dust. and the illustrations are beautiful."
2,Too Costly for Too Little Content,"Let my start by saying, its a nice short story, and adds one more short adventure to a character fans of the series already love. But......Its only about 50 pages, and that's with rather large font. It's really more of a sample or a teaser then a story, because its over so quickly. This strikes me as the kind of thing, that is typically a bonus chapter, or first chapter of the next book, that you find at the end of a full sized novel. I'm not sure I can rationalize or justify the full paperback price for something so short.Love the author, love the character, just wish it was more substantial for the price."
1,Not a book for teens,"This book is about witches and deamons. I read it before I allowed my daughter to read it. (I will not let her read it.) It is hard to read. I had to look up words in the dictionary for meaning. When I bought the book I thought it would be something interesting and true about Oxford, England. The book is short and only takes about a hour to read."
5,A Small Jewel of a Book,"Although it was a very short story, I was captivated by its many layers of meaning. It isn't only what it seems to be (as Pullman reminds us at least twice in his comments of Baedeker). The introduction of an alchemist -- who understands what alchemy is really about -- pleased my Jungian soul. And the transformatioin in Lyra -- though it seems small -- is a profound one, as she begins to learn what it means to be home.The artifacts are intriguing. Who wrote the note about Mary Malone's home? Was Makepeace on that cruise and, if so, who did he meet and what happened? While I am yearning for the length and detail of The Book of Dust, this little book gives me more than enough to contemplate while I wait for it."
1,These are not new batteries,These batteries that claimed to be new are in fact gently used. To the average consumer they appear to be new but just because they are placed in a plastic shrink wrap does not make them new. They come from New Breed Corp which is a company that buys carrier returns. They should disclaim that they are used and not sold as new. Do not trust OEM FOR CHEAP. Wholesale on new oem batteries run between $22 to $34 depending on model.
4,"Super cheap, works great!",This was so cheap I didn't think it would be any good but I had to try it. Works perfect!
3,Obviously Rich Murphy was watching another film. Get this Indie Movie and find out how the Fed has been keeping the USA in hawk!,"Steve Jacobson also has two very goodconpsiracy cassettes/CDs, one aboutthe Federal Reserve that deserve men-tion as well. I beleive he can be got-ten in touch with at: mindcontrolin-amrieca or some such address."
1,This Video makes for a Great Drinking Game.,"Every time someone says, ""and this IS a conspiracy"", take a drink. See if you can make it till the end of the tape.Cheers"
5,Good bargain saves time and money,Rather than making monthly trips to purchase fish food I believe I won't have to order for 6 months - great.
5,My dog thinks these are treats,"After being diagnosed with elbow dysplacia our vet recommended these supplements. Of course the cost was twice as much at the vets. So shopped on line and found the best price here. The difference in the dog is very noticeable while taking the SynoviG3. The minute he hears the lid crack open on the container he is headed towards it. Anyway, good stuff, good price, quick shipping!"
3,Interesting,"There is no doubt that Nevin found ancient stone tablets in Mexico, and there is no doubt that Churchward studied them. It is unfortunate that Churchward appears to allow his occult world view dominate his interpretation of the tablets. It is further unfortunate that no more credited individual has ever studied, or offered an interpretation of the Nevin tablets. So, the curious person is left pretty much in the dark as to the culture that created these tablets."
5,Favorite movie in our house,My kids love high five. They can watch these videos for hours. The music is good. I find myself sitting down and watching with the kids quite often.
2,Disney's Insult to Fans: Pure Evil,"What does Disney have against it's customers anyway???!!! This is a GREAT!!! film (in fact it is my favorite film of all-time, but like ""Son of Flubber"" and other Disney movies they give us a full-screen version instead of the widescreen version seen in theatres. This is an INSULT!!!Come on, Disney, get your act together or I'll petition Obama to create a new ""Axis of Evil"" list, with you as number One!!"
2,Why full-screen? Disney is missing the boat.,"There are countless DVDs I would purchase from Disney if they would just release them in the original widescreen format they were filmed in. I just viewed a rented version of this film only to discover that ""Castaways"" is only available in full screen format! This is a fine film and there is no good excuse for it to be limited to a full screen format. I remember seeing it in the theater as a young boy - and even then I vividly recall the widescreen picture. Don't buy this ""shot in full screen"" excuse. That is simply not true. The biggest question is, ""Why is Disney continuing to do this?"" Especially since all the new TVs are widescreen. Doesn't make good business sense at all. In the meantime, the consumer is getting short-changed."
5,*Wonderful Movie For The Whole Family!*,"A wonderful movie everyone can enjoy.If you like older disney movies,you will enjoy this one."

4,"Original, Catchy & A Bit Risky!","Evergreen Terrace took a huge risk releasing this album but I feel that the risk paid off. After stumbling on their last album unable to write a creative release they released an all cover song album entitled ""Writers Block."" Having only 2 original albums Evergreen Terrace had to give their fans something good and they did it with ""Sincerity Is An Easy Discguise In This Business."" In a time where hardcore bands are putting out the same album over and over again Evergreen Terrace did something original. They added melodic vocals to brutal old fashion hardcore and created something new. The album features tons of catchy songs that you can still dance too. This is a great album and I hope they top it on their next release."
1,My taste buds were overloaded after having just 2 cookies,"With all the talk of Snackwells being low in sugar, their cookies seem to be a little sweet on the flavoring side. I had several of these as a midday snack and my tongue didn't recover until early the next morning the things are so sweet. Don't munch on these before bed either, I guarantee you will up at least until the wee hours of the morning."
4,"If you're starting out on mandolin, this will get you there","What I like about this is it has standard tab AND music notation. For the money you can get a DVD that will also get you going, but I think the book and CD is more useful for a beginner as you have everything laid out before you and can quickly go where you want. I used it quit a bit until I discovered all the lessons on youtube, but it still comes in handy from time to time. I've been playing my entire life and never learned to read music, just always done it by ear but now that I'm also learning organ/keyboards/piano it's pretty much required to be able to read music, so I'm using this to help read sheet music.One thing I can say is that this will give you a good base to spring off of, it did me anyway."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GPS ALREADY IN YOUR PALM PILOT THIS SOFTWARE WON'T DO ANYTHING BUT GIVE YOU A HEADACHE. HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE A GPS I THINK IT WOULD BE OK. I ENDED UP SENDING IT BACK AND GOT THE ACTUAL TOM TOM NAVIGATOR. IT IS AWESOME! I WOULD RECOMMEND THE ACTUAL NAVIGATOR EQUIPMENT
3,Customer support lacking,"I agree that the product is not bad overall, except for several glaring problems - routing frequently is not the fastest, with surface streets favored over nearby highways, estimated times of arrival are far off, and several times the software has tried to get me to turn the wrong way down one way streets.It's the customer service that's a problem, however. I'm not sure if TomTom is trying to amass a telephone database since calls to their technical support only yield a promise that someone will call you back within 24 hours. Of course, as all too many others have found out, this is a fallacy - they don't call back at all.So take the product for what it's worth - a cheaper than Garmin solution if you already own a PDA, and without any appreciable customer support. If don't already own a PDA, I'd go with something else."
2,"Lots of pages, very little information","Most of this book is taken up by a lot of illustrations which contribute very little to the subject. It focuses on how registers work for use with n, I, PV, PMT and FV with very little information on all the other functions. A nice ""touchy-feely"" book."
2,Ponderable,"The item arrived and was quickly installed, and then the ""fun"" began. I got the list of acceptable disks off the internet, and attempted to update the software, but Sony had quit supporting this item. When I ask about the software, I received a message that they would ""gladly repair it on a flat fee basis"" ($100.00) nothing about the existance of software upgrades.So I charged off and installed some data on the recommended DVD disk, and after an hour, I tried to finalize the disk and it threw an error message. Right now I am trying to decide if I should just scrap it and cut my losses."
4,Steam Canner Review,"I love my newly purchased steam canner. I just got done bottling apple pie filling. I did 28 quart jars and the canner worked great. The only negative about it is that the handles seem a bit flimsy; the metal bends a bit too easily. But other than that, I love it!"
3,descent,It does make a difference in comfort. A good difference but not a problem solver for bad sleeping surface.
3,mattress topper,"After sleeping on my new mattress topper my lower back pain stopped immediately. Next time I will purchase the 4"" size, but the 3"" is working great and I love it."
3,Marvelous,Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible VoyageThe author does a fine job of portraying the personalities/eccentricities of the explorers and not merely the physical hardships endured. A good read.
3,meat temderizer,So far I like it but I have not had a chance to give it a real work out yet. It is summer and we have been away alot. I have used it twice and I like it but like anything you want to work it takes work and it is not as easy as having the steak run through a cuber at the butcher shop.
3,Decent Score With A Couple Of Standout Tunes,"Originally, ""The Frogs"" was a small theatre piece, best remembered for its performances in a Yale swimming pool in the mid-seventies. Thirty years later (and at the suggestion of Nathan Lane), Stephen Sondheim added some additional music to his score for its Broadway debut.Headed by the always terrific Nathan Lane and Roger Bart (whom I wish had a larger role), Mr. Sondheim's score is interesting, but shines brightly in ""I Love To Travel"" and the heart-wrenching ""Ariadne"", both added for the Broadway premiere."
5,NICE - the Small Faces AUDIO VISUAL Amazing Release.,This Enhanced two CD set features rare footage of the band from five different shows in Offenbach & Bremmen Germany. Includes one audio disc & one enhanced CD with the same material which originally aired on German TV. Alchemy/Pilot. 2004. This is an amazing visual experience. If you can afford to get this disc I would highly recommend it...
3,Not as good as BioBrite's other sunrise alarms,"I bought this when my other BioBrite alarm died after a long period of pleasantly waking me. I thought I would try the Junior version because I don't really care what it looks like, as long as it works, but I've found it doesn't work as well for me. At maximum brightness it's not nearly as bright, and it does not have a snooze feature, which would be very helpful. Spend the extra money, and go for the regular one:BioBrite Sunrise Clock Advanced Model, Charcoal"
1,Defective and poor quality,"I am so disappointed. The base and globe were both a very light plastic, so they were certainly overpriced by at least 67%. The one I got was defective in two ways: One of the programming buttons kept getting stuck, in fact, it arrived stuck in the in position (It's supposed to move in and out, which is crucial for programming.) The second defect had to do with the timing interval for sunrise and sunset. What is supposed to be a gradual, 30 min. sunset took 10 minutes at most. The sunrise wasn't gradual at all - despite repeated tries, it blinked on instantly each time. I sent it back."
4,Nice ear rings,Like the ear rings and I love ordering from this company. I always receive great service.
2,Too small!!,I wanted something that my daughter can play that is not a 3 foot tall bongo. She is almost 11 and wanted them for Christmas. I got a mini set and the small bongo is about 3 1/2 inches diameter with the large one at 4 inches diameter. I expected about 6 inches for the small one.
3,Chaos Theory,"This is an okay movie. Efficiency expert Frank Allen (Ryan Reynolds) makes lots of lists. He has time scheduled, planned, parsed, and pigeonholed. Then one day he is 10 minutes late to a speech (his wife adjusted the clock) and it sets off a chain of events that changes his life. He lets a woman from the audience use the bathroom in his hotel room and when his wife calls she suspects he is cheating on her. Then he helps an expectant mother and is confused for the father.I feel a connection to the main character because of his habits. He keeps index cards of to-do lists and I like to write down important errands and events to keep track of them. He leaves for work at exactly 7:18 and I like to set my alarm clock for atypical times to squeeze in a little more sleep. A key part of the movie involves finding out who the biological father of a 7-year-old girl is and it would be very upsetting if a man found out a child he had raised wasn't his."
3,It's okay,"I doesn't seem to clean jewlery quite as well as I had hoped. I have silver jewlery and even after wiping clean, this still didn't clean as well as I had hoped it would."
4,Great,"This is very hydrating without being greasy. I don't love the smell, but love how my skin feels using it."
5,Found an Old Friend,She is a fabulous jazz singer that I remembered from long ago. Finding this recording on a CD was a thrill. The sound is great.
2,"Y/A market book, UNreadable by older market","I have not read any of T.A. Barron's other works, so this may not be the best representation. My overriding though while reading this book was, ""Some people write for Young Adults because they can't write for the Adult market."" There were good ideas here, but the first few chapters had me wondering whether the main character was a halfwit. As a whole, it lacked depth and development."
3,Triple Yahtzee Score Pads,"These are all blue, I have played all my life with the pads that are white, blue and pink. They are hard to get used to."
5,I love this little knife,"Handy, sharp, inexpensive, and a RH Forschner, what's there not to like? The perfect knife for cutting bagels, english muffins, and sandwiches rather than using a large bread knife. Then since the tip is rounded, we don't need to use another knife for spreading butter and mayo."
4,Sharp knife,"I am happy with this knife, and i use it for a small prep knife. It is very sharp. The handle needs to be a little thicker."
3,Worth having around!,"This knife is very sharp, but the handle, authough very light in weight, feels cheap and too plasticky, Im not sure this knife will last very long, we'll see..."
1,Save your money,"I was greatly disappointed with this product because what I read about it and what I saw were two different things. I didn't find the presentation amusing, insightful, informative or inspiring. I had to dig to find any thing remotely useful as the presentation had no clear organization. The presenter also frequently asks the audience questions like, ""Is this true!"" "" or ""Am I right!"". Notice, they don't sound like questions, more like commands. I am sure there are much better products out there. I am grateful Amazon refunded my money because this video is not cheap: $90.00."
4,wardriving,Il libro contiene linee guida su come condurre attacchi per violare le reti senza fili quindi è utile per predisporre una politica di protezione di queste reti. Ha il limite di poter essere completamente utilizzato solo da utenti che usano linux perchè la quasi totalità dei programmi illustrati lo utilizza come sistema operativo .
2,Worth the PRICE?,"Having owned the album, I am REALLY dissapointed in the sonic quality of this CD...I LOVE THE ALBUM..My $7.99 recycled CD version sounds just as good..(or Bad)...I bought this hoping the new pressing would be updated and enhanced from the original master..Oh my album sounded better!!!This Pat Metheny Cd is still without a doubt my favorite.....In closing:I guess I need to fire up my turntable!!Thanx for looking...Rx in Denver"
5,A must have for network engineer,"I am a network engineer with over 10 years of experience, my book shelf is filled with networking books and I found this one to be among the best.Its a well organized book that cover all aspect of network security, it takes you step by step to security your infrastructures.The book gives you a comprehensive picture of the network architecture, devices and protocols, at same time offers hands-on and practical guidance to help you secure your network.If you are serious about protecting your network, this is a must have.Strongly recommended!!!."
4,7yr olds xmas day present,"This is the one dvd my son wanted when he saw me looking at stuff on the computer. So I said let's look for some more stuff and u can ask Santa for it. There were a few other things he found, but I would say this was his #1 pick. And it didn't disappoint. He absolutly loved watching it! He really likes Ben 10. He can tell u all the aliens and more. It was a great buy!"
4,"Great song, but only if you like the type","I think it is a very good tune, they have captured a great single line ditty that catches you ears, and doesn't let go, it leaves you whistling it all day long, without you even realising it!T his is one not to be missed, and comes highly recommended by myself. Satisfaction guarenteed, on the condition that you like the style."
2,Space Brothers regress.,"Compared to their beautiful and melodic interpretations of Olive's ""Outlaw"" and Essence's ""The Promise,"" ""Forgiven"" just doesn't cut it. Forgettable lyrics and pinball machine sounds don't make a song, boys."
1,Hmm...disappointing,"Having lived off the Medical and Surgical Secrets in medical school, I expected alot from Radiologic Secrets. Unfortunately, it seemed to be superficial in its content and lack the pearls I had come to expect from this series. I guess radiology just isn't suited to this kind of programmed learning."
1,misleading,"misleading - I thought this was a Disturbed ""show"" DVD - not a guitar instructional video"
4,Nice set,This is a nice quality furniture set that is going to go well in the dollhouse my daughters and I am making together.
4,Love it for my project,The furniture is nice and a great color. The China cupboard was broken but nothing a bit a glue wont fix. The wood is nice and you can tell its nice quality. The detail is nice as well.
3,broken dining room chair,"I loved the set for the grandkids dollhouse, but was disappointed when one of the chairs arrived broken in several places."
4,hmmm ... peanut butter,"As is the case with other South Beach Diet products, you pay for the system. If you want one less thing to think about as you make war with the Fat Monster, Kraft's South Beach diet may be an ally you'll want to engage.The Oatmeal Chocolate Chip *and* the Peanut Butter cookies are great for a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack, the kind that South Beach's eat-often-eat-well-eat-little drill sets you up for.I've got some at home and another set in my trusty office stash.The flavor is actually quite nice but it's the nutritional facts on the ground that'll sell you on this chunk of a system that sets you up to make your decisions *before* the munchies strike and then deal with them on that basis."
5,Chia's best,"Not to deny what's written below, but this book is the most comprehensive in the Chia library. At a certain point, the extra detail is nice to have. Learning a massage system from a book is nigh impossible, but the wealth of information in this book is unmatched by any of Chia's other books (many of which are quite good). If I could only have two of MC's books (and I've read them all), it would be this one and Bone Marrow Nei Kung."
5,Great for reading time with the Little One,"I love these golden books, i read them to my little one everyday the stories are just long enough to keep baby's attention."
1,Don't waste your time reading this sad excuse for a thriller,"What a waste of time. The author has no conception of writing thrillers. I guess she never heard of Michael Connolly or James Lee Burke who write fine prose, intricate plots and meaningful characters. If she reads this review, she should get acquainted with them!"
2,Misleading.,Product features says 3 pack bulb replacement is actually 1 bulb with shipping adds up to just under $10 a bulb.
4,Love it,"It took a few weeks for my baby to like the swing. I had to put her in it already asleep at first but then she started really loving it. She's 12 weeks now and I bring it everywhere. She is entertained by it and also sleeps great in it. It was indispensable when she had bad gas issues the first 2 months. I never had any other swing so I can't compare, but this is a great item. I do agree with others about the speed (I still keep it on 1 or 2) and that the lights/music should be separate and last longer."
4,Great Take Along Swing,"We purchased this after our son fell in love (or we fell in love) with his larger FP Aquarium swing. His swing became a must have but was not transportable. This was our solution. Although it has some drawbacks - it does the job. Since our son is on the large side, this swing only swings on the highest setting (8) and even then it does not have the full motion that his larger swing does. This being said he still enjoys the movement and it keeps him occupied when visiting. People laugh when we show up with the swing but quickly see its magic when he is napping. The lights/music are worth the extra money. We had the FP Open Top Take Along swing (bare bones model) that we returened for this one (to get the music/lights). Takes a lot of batteries and eats through them quickly."
1,SAFTEY HAZARD!!!!!,"The slowest setting on this swing is still too fast. My son wouldn't sit in it without being scared until he was about 3 months old. About 2 months later he became curious about the fish in the blue water and went to look at them closer and his head went between the two bars. HIS HEAD WAS BASHED BETWEEN THE TWO BARS! BAM BAM BAM!!! He's too young to realize, 'hey, everytime I move my head 5 inches to the right or left, it gets bashed between these two things holding me up so I better not do that.' I don't understand why this thing is on the market. He didn't need to be hospitalized, but that doesn't mean it's safe. I stopped using it, but didn't throw it away. My mom came over to babysit, she didn't know, and the same thing happened again. DO NOT BUY THIS SWING!!! TELL YOUR FRIENDS NOT TO BUY THIS SWING! AWEFUL, AWEFUL, TERRIBLE, SWING!!"
3,Good for taking a nap,"This swing is OK, both of my kids love to take naps in it. If they're up neither one of them lasts longer then 15 minutes. You can also get this swing for $70 somwhere else, this price is double."
4,We love this swing!!,"My 3 month old loves her take along swing. We live in an apartment so the compactability is really helpful and it is so comfortable for my baby, she loves it!! The only thing I would change if I was the company would be to make the handle lower because there are lights on it and my baby really cant see them, I would also make the toys more interesting so she would want to reach for them...As a swing though overall I love it and my baby does too, your money wont be wasted."
4,Great Travel Swing,"I had this swing for my son and he seemed to like it. I love the fact that it has music, lights and toys, not many travel swings have all those things! I would buy this product again."
5,Great Portable Swing,"We received this swing as a gift for our baby shower. We thought of getting the Ocean Wonders Aquarium cradle swing, but decided that it would be more valuable and useful if we bought something that we could take with us when we went places. Plus this does not take up as much space as the cradle swing and with two dogs and a bunch of baby gear already around the house, this just seemed like the logical choice. It was a great decision. Our son absolutely loves this swing. Since day one, he has loved listening to the music and watching the lights. He starts to cry when his music has stopped. Now that he is 4 1/2 months old, he is grabbing for the fish on the side and has started to activate the music by pulling on it.The swing is easy to put together and easy to take with. We absolutely love this swing."
4,Great product,this a great swing to have in the house that is very portable. Went through 2 kids with out a problem.
4,Great Soother for Baby,"My 2 month old has loved this swing ever since he was 2 weeks old, its a great soother he loves to sit there and look up at the lights or the floating fishies on the side... it is a lot more convenient than the other larger swings and a better space saver. It sinks lower so he loves to take little afternoon naps in it as well. All in all its a great asset for the new mom it buys time to catch up on the rest of the mess around the house."
5,Bought it as a gift,The recipient seemed to be really happy I got it for him. So I was pleased with the product.
3,Adequate for what it is intended for,"I needed a floating marine binocular that can be tossed in the hold to be used occasionally on the boat. These are not bird watching quality. The ""range finder"" is nothing more than reticules on the lens which you take a siting and then must calculate the distance...sorry but I left my non-floating slide-rule at home. The compass is adequate. So that leaves me with a simple mediocre floating binocular. It will serve well the purpose for which I bought it. Other than that, there is not much I am going ask from these binoculars because I feel the answer will be ""no."""
2,NO Road Runner nor Pepe Le Pew..not whats on the box!!!,I figured since the golden collection number 2 had a lot of Road Runner the Spotlight 2 would show some of those...NOPE!! Unless you love Tweety or Bugs dont bother because they are the primaries on this set. The gold collections are definately better...This set also includes a lot of cartoon charatcers that arent even well know.
2,Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection,"Bought this for my 4 y/o son to introduce him to Looney Tunes. The first dvd contains mostly Sylvester and Tweety, which thankfully my son LOVES (and the only reason I gave it 2 stars). That's fine, but the second dvd was terrible. It contained some Bugs Bunny, but everything that appeared worth watching (as we forwarded through the dvd)was a ""musical"". As my husband said, they are the ""bottom of the barrel"" of the Looney Tune cartoons. Will go for the Golden Collections next time and hope they are the better (more popular)cartoons."
5,love the puzzles,the kids love the puzzles and keep doing them over and over. and they are learning about their environment as well.
1,"great idea, horrible graphics","I ordered this item through Amazon.com. Prompt shipment. Amazon has the best customer service!Now back to the puzzle, it's great idea to have cosmos puzzle. My only problem is it is VERY pixellated. You would think a big company like Melissa&Doug; would spend some money and buy or order a picture with appropriate sizing. Because it looks like they took regular 4X6 picture and blew it up to 4000%.And what's up with the info in the front right side printed right on the picture? You could use the back side.I called amazon and told them about the problem. They refund (advance) me immediately and gave me a return label on the house.Again Amazon.com you guys are awesome!!!Melissa & Doug please look at your finished product before offering it for sale. After all everything is for the kids right. Let's not confuse them with non-corresponding colors and pixels."
5,gorgeous puzzle,"My son's enjoyed doing this puzzle since age 4. Big pieces, beautiful art work, the names of the planets (to practice spelling), and a cool perspective."
2,Not good!,"I brought this puzzle for my 4 yr old son who showed lot of interest in the solar system when I showed it in a book. He had memorized the order of the planets away from the Sun. All that understanding is gone with this model which shows the solar system as a picture from behind the moon. It is tough to make a 4 yr old understand that the moon is smaller than the earth when the moon occupies the entire model. Also, the order is not based on distance of planets from the Sun, and the asteroids are not helping.I did not like it at all."
3,Ok but not the best one I've read on 9/11,"While this book was OK, I found too much about bin Laden within the pages. I felt that part should be a separate book. All-in-all it was a fast read and somewhat informative. Good book for students to use if they are looking for both sides of the story."
1,"Henry has out done himself, this is pure waste of time.","The title is creative and the text is, at very best, creativedistortion of science and at worst an attempt to convert mythinto science by sophistry and misrepresentation. Morris shouldbe ashamed."
1,Hogwash,Scientific CreationismThere is really no such thing as 'scientific creationism'. These two words are mutually exclusive and the book is just an attempt to give credibility to an unfounded idea.
1,Wow,"It's amazing that in this age there are still people who hold views as ridiculous as the ones presented in this book. If only they would examine their own beliefs with a quater of the scrutiny they do the theories of real science, maybe then they would laugh at themselves much the same way as the real scientific community does at them."
3,Hard to sprinkle,Nice looking but hard to shake out. I put them into a shallow bowl and used from that dish to avoid the task of shaking and shaking and shaking. I will look for something more user-friendly this Christmas.
5,Nash still has it!,I have both seasons one and two. I'm waiting like everyone else for the rest of the series. This show is just as good the second time around! I love every character. These are well worth it. Don Johnson and Cheech Marin are perfect together. San Francisco is a beautiful background for this always entertaining show.
1,nash bridges season 2,there were several episodes that wouldnt work. Other than that I enjoyed the series
4,Great Review,"I heard nothing but great things about The Wire.I plan on getting the Wire DVD set next year.I am swamped with books and need to read a whole lot on books before I can read The Wire.I was excited when I found out they had a book so I can find out what the hype was about.I personaly read cop books,listen to my police scanner and I love every thing Cops and Robbers related.I dont think I could have been wrong to purchase this book.I resent myself not knowing about The Wire till it was off the air."
3,Mostly episode summaries,"I bought this hoping to get more background on crime in Baltimore, and was disappointed to find that it's 3/4ths episode summaries, and one self-absorbed intro by David Simon, and barely mentions the real stories that inspired the show. Unless you're a huge fan of the show, to the degere that you want to read the plots over again (and I liked the first season, then lost interest at the second, for what it's worth), there's not much to get into here."
3,First Timers Only,"As with the earlier review, because this book is mostly episode summaries of the TV series, it doesn't give die-hard fans any real production or factual background. There are some interesting sidebar sections about the writers, cast and the city that will appeal to fan interest. But if you've followed all the seasons and own the DVDs, this book won't add much to your appreciation."
4,best ever kids dvd,my grandson loves tractors and this dvd has everything in it that kids can understand.it has action and the narration is in kid friendly language.
5,My son's favorite,Great set of DVDs. My son loves this series the best out of all the other heavy machinery DVDs we've purchased. He looks forward to watching them over and over again. My only regret is that he doesn't seem to ask us to read to him as much these days since he finds these DVDs so enjoyable.
1,Stay away!,"The tool box was shipped in a box with zero packaging inside of the box, not one fragile sticker. Box was banged up at every corner and in the center of the lid. Come on people, don't be cheap and bubble wrap it for the next guy! B"
1,don't get it,"Customer service rep is nice, but is unable to help you. This is an old device, and worked well. But, there is no one available at Tom Tom to help you troubleshoot. All they want to do is sell you a new one. Warning: the new one will be out of date soon as well, and there will be no one to help you again. Do not get a Tom Tom device."
4,Navigator 5 w/dell axim,"Works well with the Dell Axim and a Holux GR271 CF GPS receiver. Loaded all the US and Canada maps on a 2gb memory card. Installation went on uneventfully.Noticed some issues with the maps in rural areas, think it is when traveling from map segment to map segment.Otherwise, really pleased with the software."
1,Doesn't work,I have tried to get this software to work on my PALM E2 but it will not perform. Contacting PALM technical support is very time consuming and has not been successful so far.
4,Okay but not as nice as expected,"The book was smaller than one I had seen at a friend's house and the front cover was not as nice. The story is great though, and it came with a cd."
5,Beautiful story,"This is a wonderful Christmas story, and the illustrations are beautiful. It will be part of our Christmas traditions forever. The narrated CD is amazing too!"
5,Every child should have this book!,"This book encourages young readers to ""dare"" themselves to do things they should be doing, but fear or dislike doing. Things like getting up in the morning, doing their homework, trying out for the team, going to the dentist, etc. It had a powerful on my life, and I am sure on all the children who ever read it. It is a powerful ( And very positive) form of self-hypnosis or ""Yoga"" for children, as children are highly motivated by ""dares"".Get this book for ALL of the children you love.I dare you!"
4,Motivation at its best!,A book designed to get you out of your comfort zone. Perfect for anyone on the fence. A great read!
4,Great costume,My 9 year old had an Ameila Earhart presentation. The costume was perfect for her and she got a lot of great reviews. I am keeping the costume to use for my younger daughter for when she has to do the presentation! We will be all ready to go.
1,not what picture advertises,"Bought this item for a costume party and wish I would have seen the review stating it is not what it appears. In the picture the hat looks like it could be fake leather for something with substance, it is in fact made of cheap thin fabric. The scarf is very short and the goggles are even cheaper. I looked everywhere for this costume online and this appeared to be the best one. It's not."
1,Worse book on Latin music EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is so badly written and full of errors and misconceptions that it should be banned, this should be used on how NOT to write a book. One star is way too high a rating..............."
1,I hate this toy!,This toy dosn't even work! I hate it so much! Do not buy this! I got this on my 7th Birthday and it dosn't even work. I hate it.
4,Very Strong Golden Earring Live Album,"This album was only released in Europe and is the best Golden Earring electric Live Album aside from the the outstanding acoustic Naked series. Caputures the band quite well during the Cut era. For Radar Love fans, Golden Earring goes quite over the top at 9'35""."
4,over-hyped,"There are some useful things in this book, but I think it has been praised beyond its merits. The 1st edition, 25 years ago, no doubt was unique. Today there are many other books about pet rabbits that include things that this does not. I'm not by any means saying that it is a bad book, just not THE ONE. Probably no such book exists.It contains articles by a variety of authors, so the book might best be thought of as comparable to a book of short stories rather than to a novel.One thing puzzles me: how can wild carrot be listed as a class 1 toxin? Commercial carrots were developed from wild ones. Does this mean the whole plant or only parts? The young top growth in early summer looks the same for both commercial & wild."
2,A bit light,"In the ""let's try to cover everything"" genre, this one is far from Negus' RH Linux Bible. A bit on the light side on some areas. Go the the store, put them side by side, you'll see."
1,lame,"This bag is lame. The radio doesn't fit into it. I pushed and pulled and shoved. Finally I tried pulling on the carry strap to help force it onto the radio, and the strap ripped off the case. Cheap. Not worth the price."
1,car charger for iPhone,Paid $12 for this charger which is not worth 12 cents... used less than 12 times before the wires broke off.
1,the reviews are right...stay away,this charger is seriously a pos! i got it from target like 16 bucks. i believe i got it when i was home for thanksgiving break so it lasted about two months. you know you're in trouble when it starts making a buzzing sound. it stopped working out of no where. No wonder the selling start is 1 cent.
1,Look somewhere else for a charger!,I had the charger for one month and it stopped working. I bought it because the guy at Target told me it had a lifetime warranty...
2,"full of details, but presented in many different ways..","I think the authors of this book are really ""Professional"" in working on their projects, but not really ""Professional"" on how to work together to make a good book that is easy to read and understand. I'd recommend ""Web developement with Java Server Pages"" (from the IBM ""Einstein"" & the MIT ""Rocketman"") Save your penny my friends."
1,Waste of money,"The comb is cheaply made plastic, the kids think it's cool because it tickles, but it doesn't actually get the eggs out! I found eggs, seperated just that small section of hair, and the comb past right over the eggs. My metal RID comb works far better even if it is far more time consuming. I ended up going to walmart and spending 22 on an electric one that is made to ZAP the eggs and kill on contact in addition to my manual set."
3,"it is ok, but far not the best","the hair get stock easily between the teeth of the comb, so it starts to make a strange noise, so i had to stop often to untagle it, otherwise its just a comb. It is Ok if you do not have another fine comb, but not he best imaginable."
3,Last Great Album Of A Great Band,"I think this album is the the last of a great period. This period ended with this album and ""Switch"" both from '75.This album is not ""Moontan"", ""Seven Tears"", ""Golden Earring"" or ""Together"".It's still Golden Earring that's for sure. But this album is a bit different. Instead of focus on rock 'n roll with a psychedelic touch, this album is..Well you have to listen to it. If you are into Golden Earring buy it. If You haven't heard them yet. Try one of the four i mentioned above."
4,A good album.,"Golden Earring ""To The Hilt"" #156 (1976).Golden Earring was coming off two excellent albums, ""Moontan"" and ""Switch"". 1976 gave us ""To The Hilt"". This album just doesn't add up to those last two albums. There are some good tunes in the funky long number ""Why Me?"", the title track is a good boogie song and ""Sleepwalkin'"", the bass drives this song, one of GE's at their funkiest. There is no ""Radar Love"" or ""Candy's Going Bad"", but if your a Golden Earring fan get the album."
