3,Too much breakable plastic....,"This cleaner works quite well for the tariff, but it is not exactly built to last. In the end it may not be as inexpensive as it looks because it whets your appetite for a carpet cleaner, but I don't think it will hold up very long, so you end up buying a less expensive one and then a more expensive one -- instead of just buying the more expensive one in the first place. It ends up being a throw-away carpet cleaner rather than a long-term investment in carpet cleaning. Again, it works well enough, but the land fill doesn't need more plastic. Save more money and buy a ""stronger"" unit -- even if it's Hoover."
4,Yes!!! It's a winner,"Good product for the price. I had to break down and purchase this after my quick steamer caught on fire. I figured since I had to purchase another steam cleaner, I might as well put a little more money into it-but not too much of course. I have a a dog that likes to mark around the house and it became very difficult to keep up with his spotting while I was pregnant. Consequently, some of his favorite marking areas were stinking up my house. After the first cleaning, I could visibly see a difference in my carpet, after the second cleaning I could smell a difference. This is definitely a good product for the price. The reason I gave it only fours stars is because attaching the tools to the dirty water tank was a little bit challenging-but it could of just been operator error."
4,"Excellent product, good value.","I have purchased many carpet cleaners, and for the price it is a fantastic product. It is easy to fill, clean and use. It does a great job cleaning the carpets."
3,Bad design for the Installation part,"I bought a Hoover SteamVac F5808 yesterday. It takes me long time to install the Handler(to the SteamVac body). The design to allow the user to hold the nut to screw in the screw is bad. It took me about 30 minutes to complete the ""2 screws"" installation as the part of the installation. The quality of the rubber part is not that good either. I bought it at about 50% discount of the regular price. You got what you paid for. I have not started the Vacuum part yet."
3,"Broken upon arrival, but works well after repair","I purchased this unit Jan 2011 from amazon and tried to clean the carpet. It did not pick up water at all and the contents of the soap reservoir were all over the floor, what a mess.I figured that I must have put it together incorrectly, so I reviewed the machine and it was OK. Tried a few months later to clean carpet again and same bad results.Since I am a procrastinator , it took a few months to take it to the local Hoover warranty repair facility (close by) and they had to replace a variety of items, amongthem the pump (1 day fix). Anyway it works now, but it should have been tested before shipment. Too many reviewers here have had similar results. buyer beware.I would have given 5 stars if all was well at delivery, but can only give three for the problems. Would I purchase again, yes."
4,HELP! Loose part under dirty water tank!,"Upon setting the machine up, we looked underneath the dirty water tank and there was a loose steel flat gasket (about 2"" X 1"") just sitting under the tank. it was not affixed to the machine in any way (via a screw or anything), it looks like there should have been a screw on one end. does any one know what this piece is for, whether we need to take it out and discard, or screw it down ourselves?"
4,Best Carpet Cleaner I've Found,"Well, first my neighbor got one, and I borrowed hers when my kids all had the flu. I ended up with some nice clean patches on my carpet and decided I had to have one for myself. I've rented do-it-yourself cleaners from the store before, but this Hoover does a much better job and it leaves the carpet remarkably dry. I only gave it four stars because it doesn't do as well as a professional cleaner coming in and doing your carpet, but it is the best do-it-yourself that I've found."
5,Love it,"I am so happy with this steamvac. We have three dogs and a 9 yr old so a steamvac is a must. It works so well that you'll probably be a little frightened to see how dirty your carpets actually were.The attachment can be a little fiddly. I had a some trouble with it. Getting it attached to the tank is not intuitive. I needed to call Hover once, but they were very helpful and got the issue resolved right away.The seperate tanks are great. I'd recommend this steamvac to anyone. The best one I've ever had."
5,Excellent results at a great price,"After reading all reviews and price I decided to purchase the Hoover. I own rental property and have been renting a cleaner for $35, so I could own this and save the rental fees. It was a great decision. Delivery was only three days and FREE."
4,Excellent rug cleaner,"This cleaner works very good. This is the first rug cleaner I have purchased so I have nothing to compare it to, but it cleaned the rugs better than the professional rug cleaners I have hired. The dry feature works really well. If you go over the rug a couple of extra times without the cleaner you can get the rugs so that they are only slightly damp and can walk on them in a couple of hours instead of the usual 12. I had a little bit of a problem with the furniture attachment and that is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, but I think it takes a little practice to set it up. Be sure to read the directions carefully for this attachment and once you get the hang of it it is ok. I think it is worth buying just to clean the rugs."
4,Works fine,It does a very good cleaning job and I am well satisfied with it. I wish there was some way that I could use hotter water or even steam with it.
2,Disappointed in Hoover,I was extremely disappointed int this Hoover Carpet Cleaner. It was awkward to handleand after washing the carpets several times with this machine they carpets still did notlook clean. It very difficult to clean front portion of the carpet cleaner where the cleanserand water get sucked back into the vacuum. I can't get it completely clean and I am notusing it any longer. I usualy like Hoover's products but not this one.
1,Crap!,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased. 1st once you put the steam vac together there is a hose that doesn't fit and keeps falling off. 2nd instructions do not have how much solution to pour. 3rd the hot water tank leaked a LOT im not talking about a few drips. 4th I opened the dirty water holding tank an it was completely dry, did not soak up any water and left about a gallon of soapy dirty water in my carpets.To make things worse I had to turn in the keys to my old apartment that day so didn't have time to go out and buy another steamvac. We'll see how much I get charged for twet dirty carpets that this product helped in doing."
1,Steam? Where?,"I followed the directions, put this bad boy together, and never did it actually steam. I didnt even see how there could be an option for steam as it didnt have heating elements. (if you put hot water in, sure) I sent this back as it didnt do what it said it would do, then had to remind Amazon to give me the full refund back. (I guess there was a restocking or maybe a shipping fee that they were trying to keep) Overall, a waste of time and effort."
3,Hoover Steam Vac F5914-900,I have used the Hoover Steam Vac three times. It works ok but leaves a wet spot the size of a nickel after it is shut off.
4,Hoover SteamVac - Very Satisfied,"I needed a carpet cleaner, and purchased the Hoover SteamVac w/Clean Surge (F5914-900)after some Internet research showed it to be among the best, and less expensive than most. I have used it twice, cleaning a light-colored carpet in five rooms. It performed well, leaving the carpet noticeably cleaner. Although it won't remove old stains, it does remove most spots and the dirt from normal foot traffic. It also does a good job of removing most of the water, so that the carpet can dry in just a few hours. But don't rush it - this is a much slower process than using a vacuum cleaner. Also, don't overuse the ""surge"" feature - it really uses up the cleaning water solution quickly! Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product."
4,Better than the Rentals,Did a great job of clean-up after the mess left by a rental carpet cleaner! Easy to use and a good buy.
4,Like this steam cleaner,"I bought this based on a positive review in a magazine. We've cleaned two rooms in our house with it and were pleased with the result. Based on other reviews, we pre-treated tough stains, then only used boiling water in the cleaning reservoir. The only negative is that it's time-consuming to fill and empty the reservoirs."
4,Hoover F5914,"I have had a very good experience with my purchase. I received it in a very timely manor and have used it several times. We have four dogs and one is old and she has accidents periodically and you would never know, after I used the steam cleaner you could not smell a thing just a clean scent. It was easy to put together and use. It is a little heavy but at least it is sturdy."
2,Hoover SteamVac,"Well it is very cheaply made, not sure how long it will last. The main thing I don't like is that the soap is mixed in with the water. So you have to empty the tank and put clean water in go over the area to rinse out the cleaning mixture.This just makes the carpet wetter."
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"I didn't have a lot of money to spend, either on a cleaing service or a home machine. I did a lot of research on the internet, and found that this machine had a good reputation. I wasn't sure how well it would work though, and when we used it on our light beige carpet I couldn't believe it! I was very pleased. I also found the price at Amazon.com to be the best out there.Very happy!"
4,I've been using this basic model for years,"Got this basic model years ago. It finally broke, the plastic breaks eventually. I got another which finally broke. So I searched Amazon for the cheapest highest rated Carpet cleaner. This was #2 and 1/4 the price of #1. Its the same cleaner. There have been a couple updates over the years, but this same model has been around for at least 10 years, probably more like 15. Amazing. It still works, it's the right price. I got free 2nd day shipping."
1,Will never buy another hoover,"Bought a steam cleaner and a vacuum cleaner (both hoover) about 10 months ago. Steam cleaner Worked well until now and then broke; given that i've used it for just about 4 times in the past 10 months, i would say hoover makes some of the most un-reliable machines around.And the Vacuum cleaner never had any pressure to begin with; i just got lazy to return it.. would have returned both if i knew the steam cleaner would also fail in just a few months."
4,Steam Cleaner,"This product works well for the price, the old model had a couple problems, but the new model seems to have fixed that.David, Wichita, KS"
5,Hoover cleaner,"Have used this many times since I bought it. It works well. I like that there are separate containers for the clean water & dirty water - it seems to hold more than the older model(another brand) that I used to use, which had one container with a bladder inside to hold the clean water. I also liked the hoover cleaning liquid that came with it, it does not have a heavy smell like some others I have used."
4,Works great but design could use some tweaks,"This steam cleaner does a great job for the money. It got a lot of dirt out for a fraction of the cost of a pro cleaner. It got up dirt, pet stains and made the house smell great!The only negative I'd give it is that the design for setting up the stair tool is a bit cumbersome. Baring that, so far so good!"
5,Very pleased!,"We've done two rooms now with this steam cleaner. We have four dogs and we live on a farm, so there's constantly dog hair, dander, dirt, and mud tracked in the house. The SteamVac really helped. The Clean Surge feature is awesome and really seems to hit stains hard. The carpet dries quickly and without that residual oily feeling. A great buy!"
4,Great Machine!,This carpet cleaner works great! Easy to put together. The ONLY problem is you have to keep stopping and emptying the dirty water and refilling the clean water. On one large dining/livingroom we had to fill and dump 4 times. Oh well its worth it considering it does a fantastic job cleaning and making my carpet bright and fresh!! Thanks Hoover and Amazon!!
1,Poor quality plastic brush block,"There is no 0 star, so I have to pick one.The middle brush always fall off during the cleaning, because the plastic block is easy to wear out, and the spare parts in Hoover service center costs 38USD.Just a simple calculation, after 2 months usage, you need to pay 38USD to replace the block, how much the cost to own it is for 2 years usage??"
2,Stop sucking after 8 months,I have had three Hoover carpet cleaners and shampooers. I initially bot the big boys at $300 each. Both lasted 8-10 years - the vacuum still going strong. The shampooer pooped out after about 8 years. Then I bought this model because Hoover is so highly rated and my experience with the more expensive model. This one lasted 8 months and suddenly the suction stopped and it is leaking every where. I cannot figure out what is wrong to fix it and I am not driving 50 plus miles to have it looked at. I am throwing it out. I have researched this model since and it has tons of high ratings but the low ratings are almost all the same problem - the suction suddenly stops and it leaks.I have no idea what I am going to do - buy another Hoover or switch to Bissel. I am very disappointed with this shampooer.
4,So far So good,"This is not difficult to assemble other than the hot water receptacle is a pain in the backside to get snapped in properly. Otherwise, it seems to work well and I liked the fact that it did not leave my carpet sopping wet. Just make sure to follow the instructions and use enough dry strokes to get as much water up as you can."
4,"So far, so good.","I have cleaned 3 rooms so far, and have not experienced any problems with this carpet cleaner. I wish the 'soap' tank was larger, but overall, this seems to be a good product for the money."
5,VT Big Dog Owner,"AWESOME. Several Vermont mud seasons on a dirt road and 2 big dogs full time and 3 grandchildren (several months a year) w/o cleaning and this Hoover F5914-900 cleaned 12 oriental carpets from 3x5 to 13x17 as good as any pro or better. Wool only & color test. Do not forget to rinse with clear water; about 1/3 of what came out was in rinse water, including much hair. Use Hoover Platinum Pet cleaning solution."
3,Good Steam Vac -bad attachment tool design,"The Steam Vac part works well, however, the tool attachment no longer sprays cleaner. I went through all the steps to unclog and troubleshoot. It just leaks from the bottom of the machine. I had not used it too many times before this happened."
3,kids unded 2,I like it but it does not get the set in stains but i have noticed if u put down a stain remover first it works better!
4,Decent Cleaner with a Few Drawbacks,"This machine does a good job of quickly cleaning a carpet, but it is heavy to carry upstairs, and difficult to unclog if the unit picks up any dog hairs or fuzzy bits. When it clogs, it is nearly impossible to get the water sucked back up into the machine, so be sure to clear it out (we used a stiff thin wire to get inside the uptake housing...it would really be nice if the housing were detachable).(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

5,cleans great,After using this the carpet is almost dry and it cleans great. It assembles quickly and is easy to use.
5,Excellent CD.,"I owned the cassette tape years ago, and missed all the great songs from this soundtrack, so I bought the CD. GREAT SOUNDTRACK - EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!"
5,The Eighties Rock and so does this soundtrack,I use to have this soundtrack on cassette. The cassette is long gone. I was very happy when I found it on Amazon.com. For a long time I only liked a handful of songs.Good TimesLost In The ShadowsLaying Down The LawDon't Let The Sun Go Down On MeCry Little Sister.Now listening to this again.I no longer to listen toDon't Let The Sun Go Down On Me.Now I likeI Still BelieveBeauty Has Her wayIn my opinion this soundtrack fits the film perfectly. Every song brings back a memory of one of best vampire films of the 80's. This soundtrack also features the talented Micheal Hutchence and INXS. what a great voice gone to soon may Mr. Hutchence rest in peace.If you loved the film buy the soundtrack and while your at it also buy the movie.

4,Almost perfect!,"Bought two so that my wife and I could take our own freediving gear off the ship during our cruise. Perfect for the purpose.Only suggestion for improvement is just one inch more depth in the pockets and the compartment would allow for mask, sundries and booties to fit better."
5,"Environmentalism, not a nothern idea","Taking the risk of being too short, my opinion is that this book gives the reader enlightening contributions into the North-South ecological relations, through environmentalism, helping to deconstruct the idea that northern countries are more ecological than poor countries."
1,Not a very good book,Very shallow in covering each topic. The best way to describe it is to say that it is really like a collection of pamphlets. Skip this one and try reading the more in-depth career specific editions of vault's career books.
4,"Readings for Diversity and Social Justice: An Anthology on Racism, Sexism, Anti-Semitism, Heterosexism, Classism, and Ableism",Good collection of writings on these issues. I had this as a text for a course I took and I thought it was a good book--rare for a textbook.
1,Protect your legs,"I have two cats, a dog and two small child that I try to protect from hair. I was so excited to buy a new vacum, and when I arrived home I had to try the vacum right away. Big mistake, because I was wearing shorts. All the dirt that was by my front door was now projecting on to my legs. This vacum did not work pick up any dirt. The hair it did pick up was all cloged by the filter."
4,just empty the canister,i have a dog and a child and although i have to empty the canister after every use i would much rather the dirt and dust and dog hair be in the trash than on my floor. i think it cleans very well. this is my first bagless and i am impressed. i would buy another one like this and i would tell others to try it.
1,"Do not purchase, keep shopping...","I bought this vacuum almost 2 years ago, when we moved into a new house. It seemed to work great and did, at first. I borrowed my in-laws vacuum to see how theirs did and was disgusted by what my vacuum had left behind. Do not purchase, keep shopping... the investment hardly pays for its-self. If I could afford it, I would purchase a kurby."
1,Very poor vacuum,I purchased this vacuum based on some reviews I had read here. My experience after owning this about a year is that it's a very poor vacuum. Emptying the filter canister is messy and tedious and it doesn't do a good job on hardwood floors... it spits stuff around instead of picking it up. I think this one'll head to the Goodwill Store before too long.
1,Don't buy this!!!!,Save your money or keep shopping! This was worthless. At best if feels like someone is humming and pressing their lips up to your skin on the highest speed. Now I have to pay more $$ to ship it back!!!
1,Not enough power,This product just doesn't really get the job done... and the low power and the high power are almost the same. It is a waste of money! Disappointing...
3,Not like the old,"I've used this same model for the last 30 years with success on troubled muscles. It finally wore out so I purchased a new one. Though I am very disappointed that the vibrations are less intense on the new one, the product does do it's job to work out the kinks."
1,An Under Powered Pile Of Garbage,"There is no power in these at all. I wasted my money, don't make the same mistake I did!"
3,a gentle rub,"Not what I was expecting. I was looking for something for deep muscle pain, this is not it. However it is great for a gentle facial or foot massage."
2,Don't Bother,I was looking for a personal massager for my neck and returned this item the same day I opened it. It has ZERO power. You'd have better luck getting a hamster to give you a massage. Look for something more powerful.
2,There simply isn't any power to this thing... it's so weak!,"I just bought this. Turned it on and immediately thought it was broken because it was soooo weak!Then I came here to see what others though for maybe this thing really is just this weak... and it is!So the unit we just bought is not broken. It is instead the weakest personal massager I've ever seen in my life. My wife agrees!This goes back tomorrow. I'm glad I bought it locally for this is one of those things where the shipping is worth more than the unit itself.You can put this thing on the tip of you nose, on high and then ask... ""Is it on yet?""Absolutely worthless!At least it looks nice! :)"
4,Excellent book on personal growth,"If you are looking to read a book that focuses on personal growth and looking at how your personal beliefs fit into what you are seeking, then I recomend this book."
4,um...its...well.....um.......fast?,"This is a halarious grind album, 99 tracks in 29 munites, its pure insanity, nuf' said."
4,BEST 12.00 I EVER SPENT!,I don't know what others think of this iron but I have dropped it about 50 times since I've had it and it's still ticking. Other irons I have had for half the time did not do half the job of this one.I love my iron.
1,Do not buy this record,"As Jello Biafra (lead singer, songwriter, dead kennedys) said when he performed here i Sweden, this recording is from a average, or maybe bad, dead kennedys concert. Also, when you buy this record you support DK rec. comapany, started by the other memebers of dead kennedys who wants money by Jello because dead kennedys wasnt ever played on MTV or a part of any commercial. Its sick, why should the band that made ""MTV get off the air"" be played on MTV? Buy all your dead kennedys records from alternative tentacles instead, and support Jello."
1,sellout! don't buy!,"this release [isn't good]... without Jello's permission, haphazardly put together by the rest of the band, it's a testimony to what greed and lack of talent can do...these guys have no shame, but it's now worse coz they're trying to use DK's brand to sell this CD and other ""reunion"" [stuff] - shows in Bay area, a bigger tour? a new material? god help us because earlier releases from ex-DKs were crap - anyone heard Flouride's CDs? or the awful Peligro CD that came out a few years back? take Biafra out of DK and you're left with NOTHING."
3,I wish I'd known...,"As a casual fan of punk,I am not aware of the controversy of this release.If I were more in the know of what the story was behind this album,I'd have never bought it.All that aside,musically this cd just flat out ROCKS.The energy is absolutely scintillating.So,if you're like me and not all wrapped up in whether or not certain individuals ""sold out"" and just care if the music's good,then by all means buy this album."
2,Very Poor Showing,"...one has to listen to the wax with one question in mind; is it any good?The short answer is, no. Similarly to the ""Clash--From Here to Eternity"" collection of live 'cuts', the performances range from shoddy, to poorly recorded. At best, it reminds the faithful that few punk bands ever recorded live albums worth owning; this ain't one of them.In truth, there's no need for a DKs live album, this really is a cash grab by the remaining ex-DK's members who haven't done anything of musical interest since the demise of the band, and I TRIED to give it a chance, but to no avail..."
1,Christian excercise?,"I have nothing against a Christian exercise book, I just don't want one. It's always difficult to get past the extraneous garbage that fills most workout books, especially ones aimed at women. Tossing in God every other sentence made it practically impossible to extract any useful information from anything but the exercise diagrams, which are sparse, considering the complexity of the exercises. I don't imagine for a moment that I'm doing anything more complicated than a neck roll with any proficiency. I'm probably asking for injury, doing anything else without at least a video.Oh, and in those instructions--I'm hoping she doesn't intend you to hold for several minutes, as a ""count of one thousand one"" would indicate. She just means that in the sense of ""one mississippi"", right? Oh, so clear.Bottom line: I feel I've wasted my money, jumping in without enough info beforehand, and then certainly not getting that info from the book."
3,Die cast Optimus,"A nice chunk of metal, this item has great detail however it makes a better display peice rather than a transformer. The transformation is a little unstable but it does work. A great peice to show off a poor peice to play with. A great addition to any collector."
3,"Amazing singer, great recordings, reasonable price, but. . .","This woman's voice is amazing. After hearing some of the selections from this disc played on an internet radio station, I had to own a copy. I just wish that the transfers of the original recordings to disc weren't so overmodulated. Still, it was very inexpensive for a two-CD set, and the songs (recorded in the 1930s and after) are well worth having at the price. My enjoyment would have been that much greater if the transfers had been done properly and the sound weren't so distorted--this would have been a five star review."
4,Vito Bratta is why you should buy this album,"I personally think Big Game is a better album, but, White Lion holds one of the most underrated guitarist in Vito Bratta. Every single solo of his is marvellously crafted (if youre into guitar) His best solos are on ""Wait"" and ""Hungry"" Even though all his guitar work should be in a museum.Its too bad not every track is strong, well, its hair metal."
1,not like picture,I am very disappointed. I guess I thought I was getting a small bottle of different flavors. I just got mint and I don't like mint. I would not have bought it if I had realized I would not get a variety of sprays.
4,Nice item,"This is a nice portable speaker/docking station for the iPod. I use it for a Touch and it works great. The sound output is decent and comparable to the money you spend. If you want higher quality, you spend more money. My only complaint is using the battery, it seems to drain it even when not in use. I turn it off, but only got about 1 or 2 hours out of the batteries. It comes with a power adapter, and since it is so small, I usually just plug it in now. Otherwise, it was a good buy."
5,Cyber acbostic iPhone speaker dock,"For the money you won't be unhappy. Great sounding docking station, small and very portable . Charges iPhone and occassionaly has difficulty connecting with the 3gs iPhone .( Problably due to my case around my Iphone)"
3,Good but not great,"I purchased this after reading reviews about its sound quality. Yes its sound quality is good, but not great. Its volume is adequate for a quiet room, but for my application (work in factory), it was nowhere near loud enough. The price is pretty decent for what you get. The shipping was slow by normal [...] standards, but it did arrive by the date listed on the order."
4,Good sound for small size,"I wanted a portable ipod docking station for moving easily around the house and this is it. Good sound, light weight, not overly large - perfect for my needs."
5,Great Portable & Easy iPod Sound Dock,"Got this as a present for a friend, but was there when she unpacked it and used it. Setup is simple... 4 AA batteries or DC in. Comes with several iPod sizes for docking, and those have a hard plastic back on them so you can use your iPod to choose songs while it's plugged in without worrying about damaging the connections. It's nice that this also doesn't come with anything else that would complicate things for a ""novice"" user. You drop the iPod in, press power, and that's it.Sound is impressive for its size, with only the slightest speaker distortion at the highest volume. But, even turned down a couple of notches, it will easily fill a room. For the price, I don't think you can do better!"
1,Disposable Speakers??,"The sound quality offered by the speakers, is scarcely decent, but I recommend you not to acquire them, without apparent reason, they stopped working in less than 2 months, I import them, and I'm not feeling like claiming for a ""guarantee""..."
4,does what it's supposed to do,This is simple to install and use. It keeps the Ipod charged and also makes the music on it accessible.
5,Perfect for my needs,"Having recently moved and sold speakers for my stereo components, I had no way to listen to music other than regular radio on an alarm clock.This work perfect for listenting to all the songs on my 'older' iPod....and the price was right."
4,A good cheap speaker system,"I was looking for something inexpensive to listen to my ipod without headphones. While the product description says it will play up to Nano 4G, I had no problem with my Nano 5G.Sound was surprisingly good from such a small, cheap system, so much so that I have no intention of buying anything larger or more expensive. Deep base, crisp highs, strong mid-range. I would not hesitate to recommend the CA portable system to anyone who wants good sound at a bargain basement price."
4,A good value,I am new to iPod and have nothing to compare this to. Needed something to play my music and charge the device. The price was right so I ordered it. Have been very satisfied and would definitely recommend this docking speaker.
3,Better than expected,"Okay, it's not Bose quality, but I was pleasantly surprised at the sound produced by this little system. I purchased it for my son's party and it was plenty loud in our basement rec-room. Party attendees were switching in their own iPods without any instruction.Since then, I've even used it outdoors on the deck. It can play pretty loudly before it begins to distort.I really didn't expect much with a system in this price range, but I'm very pleased with the purchase. For kids parties or traveling, this will work out just fine for me. The fact that the iPod charges in the stand is a huge plus!"
1,Lasted about 2 months...not durable,The receptacle for the iPod Touch 4 Gen. is not very durable and broke after just a couple of months...just long enough that I was unable to return it.It was very easy to use and the sound quality was in line with the price but you could tell from the beginning that it wasn't very durable. It was extremely lite weight and just felt cheap. I should have trusted my instinct and returned it immediately.I do not recommend.
4,"Little Speakers, Big Sound!","We are really enjoying these speakers for our ipods, it is an awesome product. The sound is clear and for a small unit, and that says a lot. I am happy with our purchase."
5,"Good price, great sound","No great new insights here; mainly wanted to add my 5 star rating to the pile. The only problem I've had was falling asleep while using the battery option and forgetting to turn it off! I'm going to buy another so that I can have one plugged into the wall socket in the bedroom, as well as one next to the recliner in the ""media room."" I bought it primarily to use with my iPod, but it also works well with my new Kindle Fire and Touch. Be aware that the volume through the auxillary connection is influenced by the volume set on the device as well as on the speaker."
1,Poor Product,"Whether it is plugged into the A/C adapter or run off of battery power this device produces consistent distortion, static and feedback regardless of volume level. It's too bad because when free of noise the sound quality is very good and the device is easy to use."
2,Buzzes too much,Can be used with iPhone 4 but it has a lot of feedback and buzzing esp when charging. I liked the size and the speakers sounded fine but the intermittent feedback caused me to return this product the next wk.
5,Great product for a small price.,I had been looking for an ipod dock that is of good construction. The others I've looked at looked like the docks would break right away. The dock on this product is very solid. The sound is great. My husband commented how good the sound was for small speakers. Our house isn't too big so you can hear the music everywhere. The ipod has to be firmly pressed to work. I didn't do that at first and I thought the dock wasn't working. I have the 5th generation ipod so I have to use the adapter that the ipod came with. I like that dock can be used with 4 AA rechargeable batteries so I can used it in my car or anywhere else. I'm so glad that I purchased this product. I'm planning to buy another one when the price goes down.
1,Does not have an adaptor for the 5th generation ipod nano,"We bought this to use with the newest ipod nano (5th generation). It doesn't have an adapter for the 5th generation. It will work without an adapter, but it puts pressure on the pins when you try and change a song. Plus, the warranty is void if you use it without an adapter. So, it is being returned.It sounded good for the two seconds we tried it with the nano, but wasn't worth the risk of breaking it or the ipod."
5,Great speaker,I purchased one for myself and liked it so much purchased 2 more so far as gifts. For such a small unit the sound is excellent even at volume. The batteries last a long time and it is small enough I put it into my backpack when traveling.
5,Works Great,"This speaker dock works well except my iPod touch won't dock with it. If I take out the adapter I can wiggle my iPod touch and ""usually"" get it to work, but I don't want to wreck the pins on my iPod touch so I have opted to use the audio cable. I would give it five stars if it docked properly.Update: turns out the thin case I had on my iPod prevented it from docking properly Now I gave it 5 starts."
4,Maybe not the best purchase for my purpose but could be for yours...,"This was purposely bought to play my iPod for the enjoyment of all in the car on a long drive. I was driving a borrowed vehicle without an iPod adaptor and hoped this would play well enough in the car for everyone to hear. For that purpose it was great. As soon as we passed out of normal radio reception it was put into action and handled it admirably. The only problem was once everyone else was napping I had to handle the controls myself and, trust me, it is not made for easy manipulation while driving. Trying to adjust the volume so as not to disturb the sleeping passengers was not easily done. I ended up turning it off and resorting to my earphones.For any other purpose I would recommend this as an inexpensive docking speaker for an iPod. If you're looking for superlative contruction, ease of use and sound quality, this is not right for you, but if your looking for an inexpensive docking speaker it does what it is intended to do."
2,Only buy if sound quality isn't important,"Granted, the product is inexpensive. But there is a minimum sound quality to be expected. I have purchased cheaper speakers that sound better. The best way to describe it is that the sound is not crisp. It almost sounds like you are listening underwater. Not worth the hastle to send them back but I wouldn't purchase them again."
5,Small but efficient,"I purchased this speaker so I could take my music outside. I have used it working in the yard and at the dock by my boat. It is small enough to be easily portable and provide all the sound I need. Of course it is still new but so far, no problems."
1,Unsatisfied,This product was working great until the part where I dock my ipod broke. Now it is useless and I can't charge my ipod or play music.
5,Excellent Sound small size,"I received this item within 2 weeks , at first I tought that it was smaller than I expected, but when I played my ipod on it I was amazed, the speakers have excellent sound! I use them in reunions and beach trips and their size make them just perfect! I definitely recomend this product."
1,Junk fried my ipod,"Do not buy this piece of junk. The moment I plugged my new Ipod into this docking station the speakers hummed loadly then popped. My Ipod, which worked perfectly prior to plugging into this machine, never turned on again and when I removed the Ipod from this docking station (after unplugging it from the wall and within seconds of the pop) the Ipod was HOT! It completely fried my Ipod and it has not worked since. Total waste of money."
1,Questionable quality,"This is a great price, but if the speakers don't work, what good is it? (No, the speakers don't work after 2 hrs of play...)"
2,Problem with connector,"I had trouble to get good contact between the unit and two different iPod Touch devices. It required wiggling around the units at random time. This eventually caused the connector to break, less than a month after I started using the unit."
1,poor Ipod Dock,"I was very sad, when i got in my hands, the Cyber Acoustics Portable Digital Docking Speaker Ipod, the reason, high price, mini dock, low volume and is the product I dont was expecting, my rate is 0 , I dont recomended, if you want to buy one, think first, what you wants.I will have becarefull, when i will buy another Ipod Docking. Thank You. Ed.Im not happy buyer with this Item."
5,"Great Product, Terrible Shipment",The speakers sound great. Much louder than typical i-pod docs. Portability is great by having both (1) Electrical plug power and (2) Battery powered. The seller shipped the product to the wrong address. Had to personally track down and pick up the product from the individuals incorrectly receiving my product.
1,Lasted a month,A cheap awful product. It only last a few weeks before there was a buzz in the speakers and then the volume button broke. What a waste of money. AVOID THIS PRODUCT
4,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I had been searching and searching for something like this and so far, I really like it. I gave it 4 stars because I had to take my skin case off to sit it on the docking speaker. Not a really big deal, other than having to pull the case off each time I want to listen to music while cleaning and then put the case back on each time I want to take it with me somewhere. Like I said, I don't sweat over little things, so it's not a big deal to me. It's perfect for my ipod touch, and I was really impressed how it came with extra pieces that can be used for different ipod generations. So my husband's nano can also be used on this docking speaker. All I have to do is pop off the piece for my ipod touch and pop in the piece for the nano! ~SherrieUPDATE 12/21/11: I just wanted to post an update on this item. I use it daily in my classroom, so today I decided to order another one for my kitchen. :)"
1,would have left zero stars if I could,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. No sound came out of the speakers when we tried to use it. We tried different models of Ipods and this dock didn't work with any of them. Since I had purchased it early before the holidays, the 30-day guaranty from Amazon had expired. I tried to contact the seller to see if there was a cord or new part we could purchase to repair it, but they never contacted us back. Very expensive mistake. Faulty product and bad customer service. Do not purchase this product or do business with this vendor unless you want to disappoint your child for their birthday or Christmas..."
4,Small Package Small Sound,"I was astounded at how small this actually was when I took it out of the package. It's literally the size of 3 iPhones side by side and about the same height. I have to say, for the size, it delivers decent sound. It's very lightweight and doesn't require a single brain cell to operate. I have had no technical problems using it with my iPhone 3G. It comes with a bunch of adapters to use with most apple i_____ products. To be clear, this is not a party, porch, outdoor system. It will distort if it's turned all the way up. The bass will sound like it's cutting out. But a bedside table system with a nature sounds app or Pandora set on an ambient station is magnificent. It sounds great even playing metalcore as long as it's played at a medium volume. If you want something to play at a backyard party do not buy this. But if you have a quite apartment or room in your house that you want to play some music at a decent volume than this is the perfect system."
4,My daugher stole my speakers!,"I bought me as set for my 4th gen Nano, but my daughter liked it so much she quickly threw on her Nano and never gave it back! So, I ordered another one. It's compact and has a good sound for its size. The built-in charger works fast. My only gripe is the cloth protective cover. It doesn't afford much protection when traveling, but it does keep out the dust and potential scratching. Haven't run it on batteries to see how long they last. But so far, I really like the value."
4,Worth the money,"This is a great little speaker system. Batteries last a VERY long time. I still have not changed mine and it has been since March. I don't listen to it daily, but enough to expect it to have lost power. Sounds great indoors, only negative I would give it is that when I bring it on my camping trips, the sound gets fuzzy, almost like poor reception on a radio station. This is probably because I have to put it up so loud outdoors. So full volume is not great, but for indoor projects it is perfect."
2,Defective for my ipod touch,"The dock of this item charges both my ipods, but the ipod does not play speakers thru dock. You can connect the ipod thru a wire to the speaker, and it works nicely with it's powerful speakers. However, if the dock does not work, it defeats the purpose.This is a defective item. So the question is whether this is one-off or generic defect.I will ask for a replacement. When I get a good replacement, I will rate it better."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this device just over three months ago. It is already junk, although carefully handled in an adult household. The connector in the base broke when removing my iPod Nano for music additions."
4,Heavily Researched,"I found this book very heavily researched and presenting a lot of history and detail.I find it a rather interesting and worthy work. I personally feel V'da Mah SheTashiv .V'Da Mah SheTashiv: Know What To Answer (To Missionaries) A Thorough Jewish response To Missionaries, also on Amazon, to be a lot shorter and quicker to the point. The issue simply being if Judaism believes its idolatry to believe a man killed 2000 years ago can be a deity or Messiah, while rejecting more than an ""iota"" of the Law"
5,An important book,"This excellent book treats with respect both the Jewish and Christian traditions. The reader will understand the origins and continuing relevance of both religions. Klinghoffer's thesis that Jesus accepted the written but not the oral Torah explains most of the theological and historical questions regarding the fate of Jesus and how Paul changed his message. Without a doubt, both Christianity and Judaism have a great story to tell. Personally, I take both with a grain of salt."
5,"Interesting repertoire, well-performed. A fine CD!","I have been collecting piano recordings for thirty years and have amassed a collection of thousands of LPs and CDs. I also attend a great many piano concerts, and play the piano myself. Thus any new piano recording must have special qualities to interest or impress me. Ms. Bogart's new CD does both. It interests me because of the unusual repertoire, much of which is new to me. It impresses me because the playing is full of subtlety, rhythmic vitality, and tonal color. The sound is fine and the notes informative and interesting. In short, I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is potentially interested in something off the beaten path."
2,Over zealous sound mixer,"This mix sounds like the echo machine was turned on and forgotten about. I recently got the ""Best Of"" remix and it's great. This mix DOES sound more spacious but artificially/electronically induced...after the fact. It's too obvious it wasn't originally recorded this way. They must have hired a local high school kid to operate the sound mixer cause it sucks. All kinds of echos (special effects?) and just distant sounding....like a poor bootleg copy. ..Hmm I wonder..."
2,Minibook with a mini story,"Well, when I purchased this book, I expected more in-depth features about Hanuman, not a rundown of the Ramayana (Rama and Sita's plight). I was looking for tales about the monkey god Hanuman, not depictions of Rama, Sita and Ravana.This is important: I also thought there was more to Hanuman than the Ramayana (Rama and Sita's exploits). I was wrong, at least according to this minibook. I was left languishing for more knowledge about Hanuman. This minibook did not do me justice.Yes, the publisher indicates this is a minibook. However, the book being downright mini and certainly under 100 pages, perhaps it suits a young child or tween, as they are known these days. The minibook is tiny with a hard cover--perfect for gift giving to a youngster.So, since this book does not go into length about Hanuman, specifically, and since the book is decisively titled Hanuman without discussing the monkey god in all his glory, I give the minibook two stars."
4,Thinking about getting this book? Make it so!,"This latest entry in the ""Science of Star Trek"" series examines several important concepts in the field of biology, with an emphasis on genetics. While including many references to various Star Trek episodes, the book's primary mission is to educate the reader, particularly in regard to cutting-edge research and theories. The authors do a great job in presenting this information in a manner that is easily understood, and all Trek fans will be delighted that many glaring ""bloopers"" (such as, why do so many aliens look so similar to humans? And what exactly happened to the Klingons?) are thoughtfully addressed. In short, this book is a worthy addition to a Star Trek fan's library."
3,"Good lube, bad pump design","The lube itself is decent- water based, rinses off easily, doesn't make too much of a mess of leave things sticky as long as your wash things off with water. The pump works great, but the problem is once you open it, when you try to put the cap back on, it pushes the pump half way down which squirts lube everywhere and makes a huge mess.. really idiotic design, someone clearly wasn't thinking.. Overall, decent lube but definitely overpriced for 9.7 ounces (I paid $25)."
4,comfy,"for an underwire, i found it supports ok. straps are comfy, side stays are fine. a few pulls in the fabric were noted after a few wearings but it is holding up pretty well after several hand washings."
3,Too pointy,The bra is nice but I didnt like it because it gives your boobs that old school pointy look and I have never liked that.
1,Playtex has cornered the market on ugly bras,"Bought a 40DDD. This bra is offensively ugly and clumsy. It has a lot of padding which makes my already large breasts look enormous, The cups are moulded and - of course since it's Playtex - they are pointy. I was stunned at how horrible it looked on. Add to that the fact that the underwire and band are very uncomfortable; they don't lie flat against your body, yet they chafe and rub. I've learned my lesson now. I'll never buy Playtex again."
5,THIS ONE IS THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND *****!,"Absolutely the best bra out there for the busty girls who long for style and comfort. Comfortable, affordable, and it comes in more than three colors, which is a real plus for those who want support and style."
4,quite good,"Greenwood was a participant-observer in the practics of the British magical and wiccan communities. She spent several years working in groups around london, both 'high magic' and wtchcraft groups. Unlike some earlier studies of this sort, Greenwood does not attempt to 'explain away' the results of her training. Instead she uses a more modern anthropological approach that recognizes the validity of the experiences magicians have of the 'otherworld' and attempts to find its meaning.Very interesting for magicians and scholars alike."
5,"My friend's kids love this book ... Exciting, great characters!","I first heard of this book when a friend told me how much her children loved it. I enjoy reading children's books ... since I like to write them too.I immediately tossed it in my Amazon shopping cart and when I read it, was really impressed with this author. Next chance I get, I will definitely go back and read the beginning of this series. Kids are not only entertained in delightful fashion, this book is educational too, and, too me, that's the whole point of all kids books. They should be fun to read AND the kids should learn something about life as they're reading.Keep up the great work, Ms. Osborne."
4,Good for the price,Good table for the price. Strap and pad are very cheap (we use a different pad with its own strap instead) but the rest of the table works very well.
1,IRRITATING FEMALE INEXPLICABLY WINS HERO,"I usually enjoy books by this author, but this is the exception. I found Scarlett's mistrust of Logan, in fact her entire man-phobia, to be irritating. Most of the townsfolk labeled her a crackpot, and I tended to agree. Why would someone as intelligent, handsome and decent as Logan fall for such a wacko? Surely not on the basis of a belly button ring and freckles, yet that is what we must believe to make this absurd plot work. Which makes one question Logan's IQ for pursuing her. When he becomes angry with Scarlett and walks off, I was praying he'd keep going and not come back! Not a good thing for a romance novel. Scarlett wasn't quirky, she was obnoxious and aggravating. Truly the first romance I've read where I wanted the hero to dump the heroine and tell her to get a life - without him."
3,"More than rubics and ritual, worship is an experiential expression of Her theology","More than rubics and ritual, worship in the Orthodox Church is the experiential expression of Her theology. Since I'm teaching catechism on Sundays at my local parish, it's serves as a good foundation for me to answer the inevitable question from a 9 year old. However, I found the writing awkward, and its thesis difficult to discern -- very different from the style of Schmemman's ""Great Lent."" Admittedly, this subject is more dense, but the writing lacked clarity. In general, I found it spiritually enlightening and thought provoking, even though it required re-read many paragraphs and chapters more than once."
3,Decent mask,"Decent mask for the money. I have a wider face, and I found that this was more narrow than I would have liked, causing some mild discomfort over the course of the day. It was bearable though. However, if you wear glasses, I would recommend you look for a mask that can accomodate glasses too. I couldn't test this since I wore contacts that day, but I'm pretty sure my glasses would not have fit.Anti fog was decent. I thought clarity was there, but it could have been better.Again, decent purchase for the cost, and unless you're an avid paintballer, or have a wider face, this should meet your needs."
4,Great but...,If you wear glasses it may not fit well around them. My son has two pair or glasses and one pair will not fit at all.
3,It's okay,"This mask does not fit well over glasses and is not as cool looking as others (for example, the VForce Profiler). Lens is very hard to remove considering the ease with which you can remove the lens for other goggles. However these goggles cost about half as much as those other goggles. It provides good protection, but had a rather uncomfortable fit for me--very tight below my eyes. Also be careful that you don't get water in between the two lens layers when you are cleaning--you'll have a hard time getting it out. The inner layer on the lens isn't a full thickness polycarbonate layer, rather it is a very thin piece of plastic. However it did seem to prevent fog well."
1,Hated it.,"Regarding the Blue-Ray version, which came free with a PS3 just got and could say only one thing about it: PS3 stays, Movie should go. Worst movie ever; loved all actors, until today. Now if I could only find my trashcan..."
1,Uh,"Ive heard by every body in america about how good this movie was so my neighabor let me barrow it. I dont know if he swaped the movies on me or what but this movie left me asking myself the same question i always ask after watching Will Ferrell act. Why do I hate myself so much? This guy is, was, and will forever be a joke, he cant act, he cant carry a movie, he's not funny, he hasnt made not one 1 movie that was even remotely funny. Im guessing I was watching a totally different movie. This movie sucked, was horrible, attempts at funny went unsuccessful.I wanted to slice my wrist after watching about a half an hour. This movie was no different then any other movie he did. He hasnt made one yet that i have been able to sit through it to finish it.Will Ferrell, give it up your not funny, your movie's are stupid and ignorant and so are your fans that think your funny, YOUR HORRIBLE!Giving this trash 1 star is regretful in itself!"
2,Ricky (Fricken) Bobby WTF?,Typical Will Farrell movie. Riding very close to the wall of a waste of my time.
3,Kinda weird,"It's funny sometimes. How much do you like NASCAR? If ya like it, you'll prolly like this movie. I like it about 3 stars worth."
2,Bah,I found this movie Cornie and stupid. The whole plot is very redneck to me. Perhaps I have the wrong sense of humor for this. It is definitely not for everyone. I like some of Ferrell's other stuff. This one does not do much for me.
2,Great movie the first time...the unrated one's garbage,"I loved this movie. That said, the unrated cut is completely thrown together, with several funny scenes from the original completely left out in favor of longer takes of other scenes. All the extras, however, are predictably hilarious. I'm selling this and rebuying the rated version."
5,Spider Monkey Funny,"A little crude but nothing to bad for my kids. A must have for the Nascar fan, but if you are a Nascar fan you already own this. Alot of gay stuff so if that is bad for you then look away. The movie has lines that are really funny. If you can get past the gay stuff then it is pretty funny."
2,Don't pay extra!,"If you liked the movie in the theaters, this one is NOT that one, and the parts you're paying extra for are simply nothing good. I was a little disappointed at tghe theater's version too; as funny as everyone seems to think this is, gutter humor WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE just gets tiresome. There is little to no intelligence behind this movie's humor, as opposed to a Will F. movie such as Weatherman which had some insightful comedy that was not ALL based on body parts. But if you liked the movie in the theaters, get the regular DVD version, don't pay extra for this widescreen."
2,Disappointed.,"A lot of hype surrounded this movie. Movie critics and audience exit interviews praised Will Ferrell for getting back on track after a couple of less then stellar showings (Anchor Man, Bewitched). I'd rate this film a lot closer to the lousy Anchor Man than the outrageously funny Old School or endearing Elf.I would have rated it one star, but an intriguing performance by Gary Cole saved the movie from being a complete waste of time - not by much, but just enough to get me to watch the whole thing.Someone who actually found this movie funny or even mildly entertaining will have to explain to me what they saw because I sure missed it. To me, it would have been more aptly titled Dumb and Dumber, but I suppose since that was already taken...."
4,Racey Comedy,"Talladega Nights was very funny all the way through. The characters were extremely strange, but interesting. Several very unusual situations were dealt with in the plot. The strangest of these situations was when the protagonist's best friend steals away the protagonist's ""hot"" wife, but still expects their friendship to continue on as if nothing had happened (he even casually calls for advice on how to work a quirky hot tub). The director's commentary is more of an improvised comedy session than actual commentary. Some of it is extremely funny, but some of the commentary/joking-around bombs. The cut out scenes also contain a few gems. All in all, this was the funniest movie I've seen for a while and I'd recommend this movie to anyone with a penchant for quirky humor."
4,Could have been much better,"In reality, I give this 3.5 stars. This movie had so much more potential than was ultimately realized. I remember first hearing of the movie's concept...Will Farrell playing a NASCAR driver. I laughed at the mere idea. When I found out that it was the same guy that directed ""Anchorman"", my anticipation only rose. I guess that's a part of the problem with anticipation: you can't help but be let down the majority of the time.Don't get me wrong, it's a funny movie with some very funny moments. However, being a PG-13 movie, the target audience is somewhat broad and I believe the humor (and it's subject matter) was toned down to have more appeal. Had this been an ""R"" rated movie in it's theatrical version, I imagine it would have been much more entertaining. I don't know if I can really recommend buying this movie. ""Anchorman"" was one of those comedies that you can watch over and over, catching new subtleties each time. ""Talladega Nights""...not so much."
4,Funny,"I bought this for a guy that also got PS3 as a gift from his girl. Turns out the PS3 comes with Talledega Nights in Blu-ray. Now I hate him for two reasons, ha, ha. This is a hilarious movie. I watched it in the theaters and the DVD extras are worth the money."
4,Classic Will Farrell,"The man is just funny. It's like Old School mixed with Nascar!If you need to just laugh, see this movie.**** - Four Stars"
3,This is not the movie you saw in the theatre.,"Before you buy this DVD you must know this is not the movie you saw in the theatre. The cover art says uncut, that is a boldface lie. One of the funniest scenes in the movie, when young Ricky drives his mother's car has been deleted. It is not in the deleted scenes, it has been removed as if it never existed.Other scenes have been altered to add material that was rightfully let out of the theatrical release. The new material is not funny, and ruins the pace of the original. I was very disappointed that Sony would offer this mishappen DVD as the original movie. A great cry of protest should ring out to the studios letting them know that alteration of a product for DVD release is not acceptable."
3,If you don't watch this version then [beep] you,"Just when you think the theatrical version of Talladega Nights was funny, the Unrated version is better. I couldn't help but to laugh more during this one with the 13 extra minutes, I've watched many comedies over the years, this honestly is in my Top 5 in that category. Although I watch NASCAR, it's still a fun movie to watch at least to me anyways, overall this movie gets 3.5 stars out of 5."
1,I use the DVD as a coaster when I watch NASCAR.,"Save your money. Anyone who gave this movie more than one star didn't watch it. The film has nothing to do with racing or NASCAR. It's hard to believe a studio payed him to do this. I own other Will Ferrell movies that I really enjoy watching but, not this one."
2,Stupid movie,"Except for the table scene, this was the most stupid movie I think I have ever seen. What a disgrace to NASCAR"
2,Below the belt all the way,I was embarrassed to watch this movie with my family and friends. Some of them actually decided to take off within the first few minutes.
3,Will Has A Few Thrills While Making Left-Hand Turns,"With the final action, a match-race, which is seemingly a (drawn-out) parody of the ending to the classic early-1970s roller derby movie, Kansas City Bomber, Will Ferrell brings a funny romp through NASCAR to a frustrating checkered-flag.The plot surrounds Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) and his rags-to-riches-rags-to-riches saga on the NASCAR circuit. This is over-the-top farce on the roots of stock-car racing, the commercialization of the sport and fandom.But what plagues the script is many of the scenes are quick comedic bits that are wedged into spots, which stalls the story, instead of providing a needed boost. Ultimately, Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, is not on the superspeedway of comedic releases, but certainly holds its position on a short track."
2,Unrated does not live up to the theatrical version,"I had received this movie as a Christmas gift and thought that unrated and uncut ment that there was supposed to be more scenes in addition to what was seen in theatres. Imagine my suprise when I saw that this DVD had cut out two very funny scenes from the version that played in theatres. The scene with Ricky Bobby as a young boy driving his mother's car and the scene with Ricky Bobby's pitcrew working at a car wash was no where to be seen. Unfortunately as well the ""additional scenes"" added were the ones that show Will Ferrell dragging out jokes and pushing over the point of not being funny. I am looking to go buy the original version and hope that is not butchered because the unrated and uncut version of Talladega Nights should have never made it to the starting line."
3,Will Ferell gets better ...,"Good old Will, he's a guy that can be funny, but also is entertaining.Movie moves along and has character...just like that Borat guy thatsteals part of the movie with his great character acting...but thats goodit adds to the movie..."
3,"Unrated, Uncut, Unworthy","If you liked Talladega Nights in the theater you should NOT buy this version. Somehow they managed to CUT some of the best parts of this film from the UNCUT version. How is that possible? By the end of the movie you will start to notice something just isn't right. Where is the scene when he's a little boy and steals his momma's car? Not in this movie! When does that Borat Guy talk about currency for dogs? Not in this movie! You know what is in this movie? A bunch of scenes that were cut for very good reasons. This version is a ""failure of editing."" Do not buy this film expecting it to be the theatrical version plus some deleted scenes. That would have been enjoyable. Many of the jokes you enjoyed with your tub o' popcorn and 88 ounce coke have been removed in lieu of longer, dumber, unnecessary scenes, that just won't end! Please buy the normal version. Seriously. Do yourself, your sister, your buddy, your mom, your barista, that one guy from high school, a favor."
1,CHEAPLY MADE,"Wow - for the price - what a rip-offIt is made from cheap plastic; it looks so much better in the photo.It is ugly, and light as a feather, and doesn't even come with a replacement bulb.I have to re-order this for my boss, because we broke one bulb, so he wants the same one so we can have extra bulbs; I dare not tell him how much this actually costs! (he thinks it costs about $10.99!)It really is a cheap piece of junk!"
5,Allie,(...)Yeah i agree with you. You are supposed to be saying what you like about the doll and what you dislike the doll. Not cussing or fighting or anything like that.(...)
4,The Bratz Score Again!!!!,"Ha! Lookie there Mattel, you met your match. Cloe is absoultly fantastic in this camping outfit. I don't have her, but you buy her. I don't even wanna hear how she's really trashy, ugly, and a awful role model. In my personal mind, she's a great role model. And very educational in style!!!! Only problem is that she should have went with the silk skirt and leg warmers. She's very pretty without the great outfit!!!Till next review,Gurly!!"
5,Handy Laptop Bag,"I ordered this bag because I have an IBM Thinkpad T42. It fits my laptop like a charm. It has plenty of room for all my other accessories. Ultrabay battery pack, ac power adapter, external hdd enclosure and all my cables fit perfectly in this laptop bag.The strap feels very comfortable when on my shoulder walking around. Even though its not made out of leather its very comfortable and sturdy."
2,Very disappointing,"Very disappointing video. In my opinion, this video is misnamed as it really doesn't teach any of the fundamentals of rockabilly style and seems to assume you're already accomplished with basic finger-picking technique. The Brian Setzer section is pretty much useless."
1,Filter doesn't fit lens for D50,I purchased this kit for the Nikon D50 I also purchased online from Amazon. When I emailed customer service the told me to contact Nikon. The filter doesn't fit the D50 standard lens. So far Nikon has been no help either.Other than the filter being worthless the kit is exactly as advertised.
2,Filter incompatible,"The battery, bag and book are fine, but the 52 mm UV filter does not fit on the 28-80mm lens--the one lens most commonly bundled with the Nikon D-50, which is the single most popular Nikon Digital SLR. So a kit which is being promoted as perfect for the beginner includes a filter which is useless for me. I feel like I wasted my money on this product because I thought the lenses were a universal size."
3,"Good grammar, but stories get tiring","I really liked this book and tape set when I first began using it. It introduces many grammar points early on, and the tape sets have native speakers. However, newer methods have been developed since this book was written, and I think they are more effective. The newer series are based not on memorizing dialogues and word lists, but on seeing or hearing things are responding to them. In addition, newer multimedia series are more professionally done with children playing the parts of children, men playing the part of men, and women, of women. This isn't always the case in this tape set.In addition, the tales of Dan the doctor, Dinah, the secretary he is wooing, and Yigal the American Doctor, and his family grow tired after a few weeks.The book and tape set provides lots of grammatical exercises. So, it's very good in that regard. However, like another reviewer, I wish that the book included an answer key."
4,Re-forming Gifted Education,"Easy to read, with lots of practical hints for parents and teachers. I especially love the fact it contains surveys to help, rather than just talking about them! I attended a seminar of Karen's, brilliant, as is the book."
1,i don't like this,This book is a wrong book for regia aeronautica. I don't like that authors have had the very common idea of write another time with excesive criticism about techical level of italian airplane and logistic organization of regia aeronautica. This is a worst manner of paint our country.
4,"Authentic, Poetic and Colorful","I never received my order of this CD.I have heard 3 songs only, which captured my attention.If your someone who likes latin music or other earthlyexotic sounds this is a great collection to have!.I hope that maybe you can check my order to seeif it can get here!.Thank you,Pablo de la Cruz"
4,preciosa voz,"bebe has a wonderful childish voice that I find very attractive.the lyrics need some revising, for some are simply silly, and not the silly that can be fun, but the silly that is plain dumb.nevertheless, it is still worth buying the cd"
2,"It is not the worst CD I own, but we're nearly there","I think there are very few records who compare so negatively with this one, I guess this is an album which could have been spared to us, since it was just an effort to put David Crosby back on the track. I would have gladly given him the money for free, without buying such an annoying effort from 4 great musicians to be ""modern"". The last ""Looking back"" album was much more in line with their background, but this one is really an ugly album. There is 1 good song, i.e. Compass by David Crosby, really beautiful and touching, the rest could very easily be forgotten...and probably will be (or has been)"
3,"OKAY, NOT THEIR BEST. SO WHAT?","Any record (put out by anybody) that has a song like ""Compass"" on it automatically has something to recommend it. It's true that there are a couple of clinkers here, and the instrumentation is a bit selfconsciously ""modern"". But the voices are still there, and there are flashes of the old songwriting and musical brilliance. Still better than Norah Jones."
2,not good,"I love CSNY's other works, but this one is simply sub-par. The songs ring hollow with empty synthesized instruments and forgettable singing.Clear Blue Skies, Compass, and Feel Your Love are the only songs even worth checking out, but even these are nothing special. 3 stars out of 10."
5,great product,This bed was perfect....I was so nervous about our vacation...our son is 3 and I did not know where he was going to sleep...I found this bed and ordered it right away....to my surprise it was better than expected .....so easy to use and the mattress cover that comes with it is great....he loved it....this will go everywhere with us....I do not have to worry about spending nights away from home anymore....He loved it
5,Great bed for my big 2 1/2 year old.,"We recently took this bed on a trip and it worked out great. It was very comfortable. I even layed down with him for a bit. I did not find it to be noisy at all, and we slept in the same room. My son moves around a lot in his sleep, but the sides kept him contained. I would definately recommend this bed."
5,MominCT,"We bought the bed for our 2 1/2 yr old daughter. She loved sleeping on it. It is somewhat noisy when she moves on it when she sleeps in the same room as we do. Overall a great bed and worth the price on amazon, especially with free shipping."
5,Take anywhere!,"Great air mattress!! Comfortable for my 4 year old daughter. I loved the sides - I know I can use it for my 18 month old also! It blows up super, super fast! Deflating it is also super easy! You can't go wrong with this mattress. Great size for kids! The included fitted sheet is very soft. I love this mattress."
5,Great travel bed - my son thinks it's lots of fun!,"My 3-yr old son loves this bed and thinks it's a great adventure when we inflate it to sleep at Grammy & Pop's house. I love it because of the raised sides, soft cover, its ease of use and portability. The only down side is that with the cover in place (which I have to say is better than NOT having a cover at all), the bed becomes very loud and squeaky, making funny goose honk noises with every toss and turn. It doesn't seem to bother him, but when we have his 1-yr old sister in her portable crib in the same room, she wakes up each time he moves. I'm thinking of placing something in between the cover and the mattress to eliminate the squeaking, but overall this is a great bed. The noise factor certainly shouldn't be a reason NOT to buy it, just be aware of it if you have a light sleeper! And don't forget to bring a pillow!"
2,Nice but Noisy,"The bed is very portable, great size, and looks good. The kids like it - however if you have a restless sleeper and they are in the same room as you with this bed don't plan on getting much sleep. Every move they make is very loud. We listened to our daughter move around on it for 2 hours before we moved her off the mattress and onto the floor. Would be fine if the bed was in a different room where you couldn't hear noise from movements."
5,Happy toddler,"I purchased this bed for my 3 1/2 year old son and he absolutely loves sleeping on it. It's easy to use and very easy to take on trips (even if it's a 15 minute ride to grandma & grandpa's house). The seller delivered a great product, right on time!!"
5,Fantastic bed for toddlers!,This is the 2nd bed i ordered. i now have 2 grandkids that no longer need cribs but love to sleepover with nana and Papa. This bed is great!
3,"Mattress is fine, pump broke after one use","The mattress was perfect for a 3-year old. Bought Thomas the Train sheets, etc and he was thrilled. The NEXT time he came to visit (a month later) the pump to inflate the mattress didn't work. Aerobed says they will replace it, but haven't seen it yet."
3,AeroBed for Kids,"I purchased for my 3 1/2 yr old & 19 month old to use while on vacation. I liked that it came with everything you need - bed, sheet, carry case, pump. Kids were excited by the beds.Did not like the fact that they were noisy - every time the kids moved, the bed made a noise. Since my guys move a lot during the night, and me being a light sleeper, this kept me up most of the night.Also, I found my 19 month old on the floor once (sound asleep, so at least the fall did not wake him). He ended up in bed with us every night after that as I just didn't trust him on the bed yet. So in theory it was a good idea but didn't last long."
4,Great bed for long stays away from home,"We bought this bed for a 2.5 week stay at my parents house. My 3 year old LOVED it possibly more than her own toddler bed at home. If you get fun sheets your child will like, they'll absolutely fall in love with it. My only possible complaint about it is that it does make a little noise when your child moves/turns over in the bed so if you're in the same room, you may hear that (but I sleep very lightly so...). I highly recommend this bed."
3,worked OK until the leak,"we purchased it for my 2 year old grandchild could use it while on vacation- it worked great for a few days and then a small leak developed- we wanted to send it back to amazon but the instructions say ""everywhere"" do not send it to the seller-send it back to aerobed- well from what I have read sending it back to aerobed could take months for a repair or replacement- I have not done that yet- so it sits in the bag- we only used it for one week....and yes it is noisy but it seemed to bother us more than the 2 year old..."
3,"Nice bed, but very noisy!","I was so excited to receive this bed. It inflated in less than one minute, and deflated just as fast. Seemed very sturdy and the mattress cover was very nice. The only problem was that the bed was very very noisy. Any time my 2-year-old son made the smallest move, it made a very loud annoying plastic-rubbing noise. I'm not sure if it affected his sleep too much, but it sure affected mine! I have to return it."
5,Perfect for my 2 year old!,"Ordered this for my 2 1/2 going on 3 year old son, and it is perfect. We actually bought this at the same time we transitioned from crib to big-boy bed and he has had no problem adjusting to either. This is a great, quality product and will be wonderful for trips."
1,Smells terrible!,"We've had other aero beds we had no problem with, and the design and comfort of this bed are great. BUT, the PVC off-gassing is just horrendous. We've had it for a year. We left it outside to air for months last summer. We just tried to use it last night and finally packed it back into the bag and asked the hotel for a cot instead because we all had headaches from the terrible smell. I certainly can't breathe easily with my little one's face pressed into off-gassing PVC like that. I'm getting rid of mine."
1,not so happy,"Although I bought this bed for my dog, as she is getting old and has arthritis, I was hoping it would of lasted longer than it has. She didn't abuse it any more than a child would under normal circumstances, probably even less since all she does is get in and out of it. One of the center seams popped out and it is unusable now. I've only had it since September. I do own other Aerobeds and they have been fabulous and lasted a long long time. I'm very disappointed in this one. For the money that I spent on it, it should have lasted longer than 5 months. They should put that felt stuff on the one side, like they do with the bigger beds. It seems to be much sturdier. I will know not to buy something like this at Amazon so that I could have returned it after 30 days."
1,What a piece of trash,"I've owned two of these mattresses over the last five years. The first one started leaking. Being a bit lazy (and a bit rich), I didn't bother to return it; I just bought a new one. It also began leaking after a short while. Aerobed makes a crappy product, pure and simple. It's way too flimsy to expect it to hold up under normal wear and tear."
1,Missing Pump,Product was shipped without the air pump. Basically useless without it. Hopefully Amazon will do the right thing.
3,Great Bed - for kids under 3,"Great bed: comfortable, inflates quickly and easily. NO WHERE ON AMAZON DOES IT SAY THAT IT IS FOR CHILDREN UNDER 3 YEARS OF AGE. It would have been good to know this before buying a product that you can not return."
3,"Good product, but came damaged.","We purchased this because of the great reviews. Overall, it is a well-designed item and my almost-three-year-old loves it and sleeps well in it. It inflates very quickly and easily. However, it leaked from the moment we blew it up. The enclosed patch kit was completely useless so we had to go to the store and buy another kit. Despite the inconvenience right before our trip, it works well now. Perhaps we got a lemon. I would purchase this again, but allow more time for a return if necessary."
2,Lots of Psycho Babble that says nothing,"Harville Hendrix's book, Getting the Love you Want was fantastic--likely the best book on relationships ever. However this book on child rearing is awful. Let me explain why.... The book is loaded with psycho babble and politically correct themes that mean nothing. If you read chapter 1 and Chapter 2 and then ask yourself, what did I learn? You will have to say, uh.. nothing. Chapter 3 is where it should start getting interesting, and although the topic ""unconscious parenting"" is a good one, there is too darn much fluff.Getting the Love You Want was short and to the point. I think this book, Giving the Love that Heals, could have been 1/3 the length of what it is. We are a busy people, and shouldn't have to put up with writing that says nothing. This drives me crazy!I am sure there is something worthwhile in the book, but believe me, you have to skim it quickly to get to those points."
2,Wait for the paperback......at your library book sale,"I will give this author two stars - one for finding a publisher willing to print this material and one for some interesting military science fiction. Otherwise this effort is simply a comic book level attempt to solve all the world's problems (apparently ignored by the ""liberal western media"")in America's favor with bigger bombs and faster planes."
4,"Possibly great system, depending on price","I've purchased a few of these, they're pretty much my go-to system (or were, when they were still in retail stores) for my HTPCs. When I bought my original system I think it was around $200, which was an average deal for what I'd consider an entry-level system. However, I did find a second system when they were clearing the shelves for $90, and I'd consider that a steal. These things actually put out a pretty decent amount of sound for the price. They definitely aren't a premium system; there's a lot of muddy middle sound, the high-end isn't super clear, but the bass is good enough. Basically, if you're looking for something that would be the next step up from the speakers on your television, without just getting absolute garbage, this is it. Value will definitely depend on how much you pay though."
1,A Blue Christmas,"I really wanted to surprise my wife for Christmas, as this was her signature fragrance. Yet after the first spray from the freshly opened bottle she knew something was terribly wrong. Lauren used to have a spicey and exotic fragrance, complex yet alluring, or in a word - mysterious. The bottle I purchased from Amazon smells like kerosene mixed with bug spray! I really should have listened to other reviewers. To make matters worse, Amazon policy does not allow the return of liquids considered hazardous, and that means this perfume! So now I am out $50, my wife is quite upset, and in the future we will take our perfume purchases elsewhere."
1,Reformulation,"I too was disappointed with a recent purchase of Lauren. I wore it in the 80's, and when I tried the ""new"" stuff I was sorely disappointed. It is NOTHING like the Lauren that I remember."
5,Excellent and Efficient!,"Excellent mother's day gift! The smell is extremely wonderful. A bit on the expensive side, but worth it every now and then."
5,Fast delivery!,The perfume came very quickly via mail. It was exactly the same kind you'd find at the mail but cheaper. Yay!
2,Not a good step in the evolution of guitar music.,"As a guitarist myself and someone who has studied many styles over three decades of playing, I've heard and played with some amazing players. The guitar craft style and its practitioners have some nice stuff and good technique within the realm that they explore, but they are really far from being complete guitarists. Any great classical musician and/or teacher likes to use this kind of playing as an example of something to avoid falling into. My teacher did. Hardly a shred of passion or personality to be found in even the best guitar craft musicians... and their technique is actually not that amazing. I've played with players that can play far better in every respect. Sometimes we would sit around and imitate the Fripp technique just to illustrate how far from elegant that kind of playing actually is..."
5,More Great Quick Meals,"Love this one, I'm ""on the go"" most of the time and this book enables me to have quick and really good meals. The Baked Crab Cakes are outstanding. Grab this one if you want good food that take less time and taste like you spent hours in the kitchen."
2,gourmet-- not!,"Good concept in theory but does not work out well in real life. I am giving this product 2 stars because I have not tried all the recipes, but would have wanted to give it 1 star. I tried out two recipes, and both were inedible. I'd rather slave over the stove for 4 hours using real ingredients, than cook for 30 minutes and throw it all out."
5,Love this clock!,I have had my Reminton clock for over 10 years. It worked great with gentle lighting...it was just enough to wake me early without waking my husband. The cricket sound is great to go to sleep with... made us feel like we were camping. The storm sound I liked too. I originally bought this clock from Hammecher Schlemmer...they still sell it and they have a no questions ask lifetime gaurantee on the clock! Awesome!
4,Owned it for years - what will I do if it ever dies?!?!?,"Disclaimer: Should be 5 stars but recently I've decided it should have a CD/MP3 player in the base. I don't think it would add a lot of bulk and I sure would love to hear a sleep meditation along with my nature sounds of choice for the evening.Truly a wonderful product. I believe I originally bought this 9+ years ago and have loved it ever since. It came with scent beads of coffee and grapefruit and lavendar and some sleepytime blend... so wonderful. The bulb has gone out in mine. Super sad but it only went out about a week ago so it was the bulb's time to go, I suppose. Overall, I can't imagine how many nights I would have lie awake in bed without this wonderful item. I love it so so much. Dreading it's demise. Really and truly. Can't even find a comparable product. Let's hope Remington people read this and bring out the CD/MP3 option before I have to lay his amazing piece of technology to rest."
5,MOVING,THIS CD WAS GREAT AS WELL AS THE MOVIE. THE MUSIC IS BEAUTIFUL. I AM SPEAKING OF THE INSTRUMENTALS THAT ARE ON HERE IT IS REALLY TOUCHING!!!
5,Brook Benton - 40 Greatest Hits,"This 2 cd set is outstanding. Due to the fact that Brook Benton is the best male singer in U.S. history. The silky voice, the unique pronunciation of words, and the way he puts himself into the song he is singing all combine to make his performances outstanding!"
4,good story but silly chapter headings,"I have read and enjoyed a number of books by Earl Emerson. He always has a good sense of place, interesting and sympathetic characters and the fire fighting action and descriptions are great. I like the sense of humor throughout his books but what always bothers me are the goofy chapter titles. They make the whole thing seem too cute or silly. His books deserve better"
1,Don't be fooled.,"The review-length sketch outline of this book appealed to me greatly -- it was hyped as a sort of magic realism fairy tale-come-love story. It is not. It isn't anything. Except bad. What it is, is pedantic, poorly-written pablum. Sherwood doesn't even trust the reader to ""get"" his ham-fisted, overwrought and entirely cliché message, so he reminds us what it is every ten pages (""[He] know everything about the fastest coconut tree climber...but [he doesn't] know the first thing about love."") Please...*please* do not read this book. It is not worth your time. Read anything else."
4,A nearly perfect book...,"Loved it - a small jewel of a book. I listened to the audio by Paul Schramm, who was the nasty fat guy on ""Wings."" He's got a fabulous voice. The writing was exquisite. It's almost like a poem...the author is a true wordsmith. But it did lag a little by the end. I know the other reviewers here said it was predictable, and it was...but still...the writing and the characters were so enchanting...who cares? The ""predictable"" part was about ""great love."" We could use a bit more of that ""predictability"" right now. Cudos to Ben Sherwood on a winner. Frankly, he never needs to write another book - I think this will be one of those little classics."
2,It was okay....,"We read this book for our book club, and the overall feeling was that it was a quick, easy read, but very predictable and a little over the top. We all agreed that we wouldn't be passing this book on to friends to read as we did not enjoy it that much."
2,Write What You Know,"Ben Sherwood should have followed the advice commonly given to writers: write what you know. I grew up 15 miles from the real Superior, Nebraska, and although Sherwood got the geography right, he completely missed the mark with his characters. Guess what? Those of us who live in the Heartland are not caricatures. We don't have ridiculous-sounding names, don't wear new overalls as our ""Sunday Best"" and don't host parades every time a ""New Yorker"" comes to town.The details about agriculture were way off...obviously just thrown in to make the story seem as if it were authentic. A five-minute check could have saved those simple mistakes, but nothing will change the stereotypes that abound. It's too bad, because the premise of the story is unique and the humor is well-done. Bottom line: either write what you know or take the time to get to know the kind of people you're writing about."
2,Fun but very thin,"The author does have a fun, goofy plot idea, buy it wears very thin. A bit didactic, too. A light read, not unpleasant, but not terribly engaging."
3,Good introducation,This is a good book for those who are not familar with special eduacation. You will gain a new understanding of some the family challenges that arise and yet every situation is unique.
4,Great Book. Very useful.,"Awesome manual just like all Hayne's manuals. Easy to follow step by step instructions specific to the year/make/model on the front full of pictures, diagrams, and helpful tips to get the job done. I also liked that this book gave history on this model of ninja. I learned that I have what's called an ""E"" model ZX6 and also learned what that was and how that was important when working on the bike and buying parts. This book is great for anyone who doesn't have the bike's owners manual, or even somebody looking to completely overhaul their Ninja Sportbike."
3,An awsome dissapointment,"The first thing ill say about the beast machines series is that it wasnt THAT bad. ok so the references to previous series were a little choppy. and the transformation method they use lacks the old familar clank and bang sound affects we all grew up with. But put it this way, this is the only continuing series to follow up our much loved beast wars, if you refuse to watch this than i suggest you invest in the beast war action figures and make your own follow up show. however in this reality beast machines is in fact a peice in transformer history, and if your a real fan then you would be happy to respect this chapter of the transformers saga and buy this dvd set. ""I AM TRANSFORMED"".....heh...that was kinda corny"
2,Ruins Beast Wars,"Beast Wars, while inferior visually to Beast Machines, was a great series. When the show ended there was much closure and it felt complete. Then came along this show, which effectively ruins the ending of Beast Wars and makes everything depressing. We were content with how Beast Wars concluded, and I hate how Beast Machines continues a story that didn't need to be continued. It was finished. What a complete shame."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"As a tap dancer and as someone who loves both New York and New Orleans, I really wanted to like this book. It just left me cold. Maybe it was that her obsessive search for an orgasm was such a lame metaphor. Maybe it was her complete self-absorption. Maybe it was the fact that her father seemed to be a much, much more interesting character than she was, and yet he wasn't given nearly as much play. While it definitely has its moments, this book is ultimately a disappointment. And when she finally HAS an orgasm, my guess is most readers will say ""so what?"""
4,"Smart, compelling fiction","I was familiar with some of D'Erasmo's writing in the Voice, and so I looked forward to reading Tea. Simply put, this is a terrific novel; it was compulsively readable and struck a perfect balance between detached third-person narration and the at times overwhelming emotions of Isabel, its protagonist. There wasn't an overabundance of attention on the establishment of Isabel's sexual identity, and I liked that D'Erasmo focused instead on other aspects of character development. The book's sharp humor appealed to me, and overall, this was a relatively quick but still satisfying read."
2,dilute,"written well enough, but a pretty exhausted theme and flat, undeveloped characters. not really worth the bother."
5,China Syndrome Now Occurring!,"Take a step back to the seventies and just dream that this very thing, The China Syndrome, is not occurring right now under the nose of Fukushima meltdowns. And take a look into how the nuclear big wigs are most probably still pulling the shots! It's all in this film. What was a dream of a disaster then, is like a cakewalk compared to what is happening today, and somehow, the film then becomes somewhat comforting..."
3,Syndrome,The Movie was Actually Boring it had a lot of talking in it but it had a Really Good Crash Scene so I give it 3 Stars.
4,Not bad.......,"It was a pleasure to see attractive Black women nude in a video without having a penis stuck in any open orifice. There were three young women that were very attractive.One beauty,either next to last or the last segment had a body that was very nice and perfectly proportioned without implants(it wasn't perfect but she definitely got my attention) Crystal Knight is,I think,overrated and not as attractive as some of the other women on the DVD. I think that the women could use better direction and coaching as they looked a little stiff.The young lady with reddish hair on the steps(I think it was the second scene had a perfect body(the implants didn't take away from her). She made you stand up and take notice. Overall, I think this was a good purchase for softcore. I wasn't really looking for hardcore. All of the women aren't perfect. Neither is life"
5,Decent slice-of-life school drama...,"This series isn't too bad, for what it is. If you're a manga fan you'll probably love it. Looks to be taken directly from the pages of one, in its animation at least. Lots of exclamations and short scenes you'd typically find in a manga. Overall, if you like something like Azumanga Daioh, you'll probably like this. Has many of the same Eng. Voice actors from the My Hime/My Otome series. I give it a 5/5, as long as i'm not comparing it to more recently released stuff."
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased these rollers based on the great reviews that were given. I had been using a set of Clairol rollers which worked well; however I wanted a set with larger rods. These seemed to be the perfect set since I travel quite a bit. Even though I overheat the rollers, they won't hold curl the way my other set would. I have tried leaving the rollers in much longer than I should and I still can't get the curls to last. The clips also leave crimp marks in my hair. I am back on Amazon searching for an alternative!"
1,Would not recommend this product,"Rollers don't get hot enough so curls don't last. Clips that come with product aren't easy to travel with, big, bulky and feel like they would break easily. Product should include smaller clips instead. Ones that you can stow inside the unit. Only good thing is rollers heat up fast."
1,never would buy this again,"The heating rollers worked fine, they heated quickly, and the clips held my long hair without any problem. The issue is - this is NOT travel size - case is way too large and delicate plastic. There is no storage for the clips. To call this a Travel Hairsetter is a joke. If you want to use this for normal everyday home use, should not be a problem. If you want this for travel (as advertised), forget it."
4,"Very good, but not as ""Jumbo"" as I wanted","These rollers do a great job, they do heat up very quickly, but I was looking for GIANT rollers. I would still recommend them. They're the best rollers I've used."
1,Conair Jumbo Rollers Instant Heat Travel Hairsetter,"I was very disappointed in this product. The rollers do not get hot enough to firmly set your hair, the clips do not have anywhere to be placed so you must carry them separately and it is not as small a unit as their older product with 5 rollers & clips in a small case."
5,On The Go!,This hair setter is great! The plastic rollers grip the hair better than my other hair setter with smooth rollers. The rollers stay in the hair and the curls are long lasting...even in humid weather. Heats up fast. Love these hot rollers for quick and curly styles...with lots of body! This will be great for traveling as it's dual voltage. Highly recommend!
4,Great compact set....but not for travel...,"I love these rollers. In fact, I'm on my third set. If you close the lid they do get very very hot, and they don't take up much room on the bathroom counter. My only complaint is that they take up a huge amount of room in a suitcase. And, the plastic lid cracks. In fact, that's why I'm on my third set. After about a year of business trips, the lid will be cracked beyond use. So, I'm going to buy another set of these for the bathroom counter, and try another brand for the road."
2,Doesn't Measure Up,"I have the full size version of these rollers, and I can tell you - they are FAR superior to these travel curlers. The box advertises instant heat, but in reality my curlers take about 5 - 10 minutes to heat up fully. (I have pretty thick hair, so this means I have to put all five curlers in my hair 2 times, thus having as much as 20 minutes heat up time to do my whole head!) Even at full heat, these curlers don't make the cut. They are barely warm (especially compared to my full size ones) so they barely curl my hair. After about 30 minutes, all curl is gone completely. I don't know if I got a defective set, but these definitely weren't worth the money or the space savings. I should have tried them before I left for my trip, becaue they don't work at all on my hair."
3,Great size but extra rollers needed,"This product has great-sized rollers for long hair and average heat-up time (slower than advertised). But what happened to the ability to order extra rollers at Conair? You can order clips or clamps, but no extra rollers.I have substituted a similar size and style roller from another unit, in order to get the number I need. Extra rollers take up less room to pack.I have been using Conair products for 20 years, and as a Flight Attendant, I have had rollers and hair dryers with me on the go. The base electrical portion of the unit always outlasts the inadequate lids. I live with the lids until they crack, but they eventually fall off. Do you get the message Conair? Develop a hard plastic top or use something else.I am glad to have the dual voltage, now just fix that top and let us order extra rollers."
3,Roller lacks consistency.,"The rollers are nicely portable, although you must separately purchase clips that fit into the case. Biggest issue with curl is the each roller is split to slide into the heating unit, not like your typical circular heating port. If the tip of your hair falls into this, the curl is irregular."
2,Disappointed,"I should have listened to the reviews. Clips too flimsy, can't keep the rollers in place and the rollers tend to overheat. I thought I could make 5 rollers work with my hair, I was wrong. I have thin hair so cannot imagine how someone with thick hair could use this product. I am giving the product two stars only because i do not like the 'hate' reference when you select 1 star."
3,IT'S OK,This CD was okay in my opinion. It contained about five singles that I really enjoy listening to. The remainding singles somewhat sound a lot alike.[...]
2,Disappointed,Item was advertised as Quarry Beige the seller sent Quarry. Was disappointment that item was not sent as advertised.
1,ego dressing,"An amazing journey of a man who trades one set of ""ego clothes"" for another! I kept expecting this book to reveal more of the inner transformations required of the mid-life journey but alas all I got was septic tanks and rodents! This would be a great text book to show how not to take the journey!"
2,Thomas Merton Deserves Better,"I read this because I enjoy John Katz's work and also Thomas Merton's [having spent a week at the Abbey at Gethsemani last year]. While the book is entertaining, the idea of it having anything to do with Merton's quest for solitude, contemplation and a soul jouney is misleading. Had Katz ever [even for a week], turned off the computer, telephone, CD, TV, etc. he might have had a chance at interior change. His reasoning that, unlike Merton, he had found inner peace.....was self-serving. He may tell himself that he wanted to take a spiritual jouney with Merton [page 14], but he was never willing to do the ""work."""
3,Perfect book to start a new year,"A perfect book for the first day of a new year.This year my husband and I will both turn fifty and our youngest child will leave home for college. I have a lot in common with Katz.My favorite quote: ""I am not nearly as afraid of dying as I am of the hinges inside my mind and soul rusting closed. I am desperate to keep them open, because I think that if they close, that's one's first death, the loss of hope, curiousity, and possibility, the spiritual death. After that, it seems to me, the second one is just a formality."""
4,A great trip..,"Take it...This is a very special book, I've got to say, and I go through a lot of books..This guy has really touched a nerve.."
5,From a compulsive reader who loves Merton - fabulous,"I enjoyed this book tremendously. Anyone who sees the contemplative spirit in his dog is not only funny but wise. If you get nothing else out of this book, you can admire how Katz comes to terms with his fragile self image and in a very moving passage describes leaving his old self in the dust and seeing himself in a new, stronger, freerer way. That was, to me, a very sure sign that he had indeed met God on the mountain. Merton would love this book. Get it!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"Wow, whoever came up with this album chose some great music, just the worst title ever. I didn't recognize all the songs, but as I scrolled down I saw the song ""Every Rose Has its Thorn."" Poison was NOT a one-hit wonder. I can think of many other songs they sang: Talk Dirty to Me, Fallen Angel, Unskinny Bop, Look What the Cat Dragged In, just to name a few. I also thought it was funny that the name of the artists were left off. Could that be because they didn't want you to start thinking about who the artists were? Hmmmmmmmmmmm."
1,Its cute how people try to like her,"The band IS great, but the singer isnt. Maybe when she learns sing right I will buy the CD, but that will most likely not happen."
4,The Basics of Christian Doctrine,As a new Christian I found this book to be very enlightening as to explaining what most Christian denominations subscribe to as the basics of Christian doctrine. Makes clear the essentials.
5,great accessory,The battery pack is a fantasic addition. One disadvantage is that it does make the camera heavier than what I expected. Great idea of putting the camera door inside the pack. lot easier not to lose it.
2,Trouble with the connection,"Although I wanted this grip to work well and was optimistic, I was unable to get the camera to remain turned on because the connection must have been a little loose. Although it was installed properly and tightened completely, the camera kept turning off while I was shooting unless I squeezed the grip onto the body with my hands. Obviously this is not going to work in the long haul and I will have to return it. I re-installed the grip twice more, but still had the same problem. It's too bad because otherwise I like the grip and it's a good value if it works correctly."
4,A very good value compared to other options.,"I wanted a battery grip for my XT and didnt' want to pay what the Canon grip was selling for. I did a search and came up with the Opteka, read some reviews on it and it sounded great. I bought it and have no doubts that I made a good decision. It feels great, works wonderfully....taking portrait oriented photos are so much more comfortable now. It also adds some weight to the camera which I found balanced some of the heavier lenses I own to feel more comfortable. I've got large hands and holding my XT is much easier now. I haven't done any serious battery tests, but at first it seemed like the OEM batteries drained pretty quickly. Maybe I didn't fully charge them, because now I don't notice at as much."
5,Excellent accessory at an exceptional price,I chose this over the original Canon part due to pricing and haven't been disappointed with the quality. I have been using this for over 6 months and it has been working great and both batteries are still going strong. Fits perfectly with my XT and makes it a lot easier to handle.
3,You get what you pay for,"I've been doing a lot of research into the Opteka grip with batteries. Yes there are lots of good reviews but there are some problems.1. The electrical contacts are unreliable.2. The quality of materials is not at the same level as the Canon BG-E3.3. The batteries that come with it are not reliable and don't last as long as advertised.The Canon BG-E3 gets nothing but rave reviews. Yes it does cost almost twice as much, but in my mind the Opteka is not worth the risk. Some say you pay twice as much just for the Canon name on the grip - NOT TRUE. You're paying for a better quality product. Yes - Canon accessories are over priced, but for the most part you get what you pay for. In my humble opinion, it's worth the extra $$ to get the Canon and not have to worry about a thing."
4,Opteka Battery Grip/Batteries,Overall a great value. Grip has good feel and buttons are ok. Comes with and holds 2 batteries. Battery life seems a little shorter than the double I would expect based on my original Canon battery.
5,Go for it!,"I purchased this unit for my xterra as I often journey places with my truck away from cities and can't get any decent stations. This unit works really well and Sirius's channels are unbeleivable in content and signal clarity. Forget XM, go for Sirius!"
1,What a waste of money!,"I thought this would be the music remixed sort of like Z-Trip remixes old songs in a hip-hop style, but it's just some crummy rappers singing the lyrics over the original AC/DC music. If you like AC/DC, you'll enjoy the intros, but once the singing starts, its turns to a lousy cover by some mediocre rappers. And I assume this CD is meant for AC/DC fans, otherwise stores wouldn't stock it under AC/DC. It sucks that you can't return open CDs. Maybe I can get 37 cents for it on eBay so I can stamp my complaint letter to www.tributesounds.com. But I doubt anyone would be willing to pay that much. Oh well. At least I can warn other unsuspecting buyers. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,A Great Absorbing Narrative,"Ann Larabee tells an engrossing story. A well structured, well written narrative. Meticulously researched. An enjoyable read."
2,"Not the original Dell keyboard, space bar not great","I bought this keyboard to replace the original on a Dell Inspiron E1405 after a key broke. This keyboard is not the same as the original. Everything works fine except the space bar. On the original keyboard the space bar registered no matter where it was depressed - right, left or center. On the new keyboard the space bar only registers if pushed directly in the center - only when hit in the center can you feel the key ""click"" and register when depressed. Pushing on the right or left side of the space bar does nothing - the space bar just leans right or left, it does not ""click"". This makes the keyboard a little aggravating to use. I'm currently looking for another replacement..."
1,This did not work at all!,I was totally disappointed with this purchase.I thinks this item was DOA (Dead on Arrival). Amazon should audit their sellers. I opened this keyboard after returning from a month and a half business trip. I tried to install it with my Dell Inspiron 6000 and it did not work. I restarted my system thinking that it will be recognized at the bois level. But it still did not work. I hope the seller will allow me to return close to two months.
5,great book,"absolutely great book, necessary reading for anyone who thinks this country is ""free"" for anyone but the wealthy"
1,Don't bother to purchase this item.,This product is not worth the money. Praxis simply took what was on their website (including the SAME practice test) and put it into book form. Praxis was simply trying to make more money off of teachers.
4,No surprises,Anazon walked me through the selection process to ensure I was ordering the correct product for my car. The air filters arrived well wrapped and in good shape. I installed the first filter and it fit perfectly. Good job by Amazon in the selection and shipping process. Would not hesitate in ordering this product again through Amazon.
1,FAKE REMINGTON - PIECE OF CRAP - BROKE WITHIN TWO MONTH,"As others stated, this is not a true Remington product. It comes in plastic baggies, unlike normal Remington blades and foil. This was not disclosed before the sale. Also, the item basically fell apart after only a few months of use and the metal is now jutting out and cutting my skin. This has never happen before with a real Remington. And, sadly, ""Shaver Oultet"" is charging the true Remington price for this shoddy item. DO NO BUY THIS ITEM!! You will be doing yourself a favor.Thanks."
2,Beware of refurbished items,"Although not evident in the item sale description, this is a refurbished item. A little overpriced for something that is not in the original package. This item arrives in a plastic baggie and is similar to what you would find on ebay, except here you are paying full retail price, note you do not receive a full retail item."
1,this is not a toy!!!,"I was really disappointed, it was described as like new...when it arrived, packed in a shoe box, small stain on her gown, what part of this like NEW? Lucy Dolls should be in the box they came in!!!"
1,awful,"I bought two of these because I found a crazy deal somewhere, $40 each. Even with this terrifically low price, the lens is really lackluster.First of all, with ""macro"" in the title, I expect it to be a macro lens. Look up ""macro lens"" on wiki and it'll tell you that it's for extreme closeups (which generally requires you to be able to focus on things extremely closeby. Looking at the lens itself, it says its min focus distance is 3 feet. What gives?So my entire reason for buying this lens is nulled. Oh well. How's it do otherwise? Well, compare it to Nikkor's 55-200, list price is only $50 less and it doesn't have VR and doesn't have Nikkor's quality level.Autofocus on this lens is obnoxious, it sounds like there are little gnomes inside, cranking 100 year old gears.Sorry Tamron, I'll stick with Nikkor next time unless you can win me over with another one. I will probably end up just taking these apart to play with the elements and come up with a science project."
2,NOT AUTOFOCUS,"Tamron makes great lenses. Most ads are clear about their features. However, Keh never makes clear, in fact quite the contrary with the D40 through D90 series bodies, that THIS lens is NOT supplied with the autofocus motor!! It took me several hours after purchasing it to find other people who had discovered the same thing. NO auto focus motor in the lens for Nikon which take the DX series of lenses.BE AWARE of this when you look at the specs. Note the AF does NOT mean Auto Focus!!Thus far Keh has not been responsive to my request for more info or a return authorization either."
4,another good lens,good build for themoney and will be used as a quick back up for my Nikon. As was stated in the ad the auto is not compatible with the d5000 but tried it on my brothers d300 and its auto focus was dead on.
2,"Flickers Incessantly, Viewsonic Support Has Not Responded","I bought this monitor because of all the excellent reviews itgot, because of Viewsonic's service reputation, past satisfaction with Viewsonic products, and because it looked good in a store. However, on my machine (a Dual Athlon with a Radeon 9700 card) it flickers incessantly, making it useless. Viewsonic has not responded with assistance or a warrantly replacement despite my submitting 3 requests with them.When it works, it looks nice for the price, but since it isunviewable about 50% of the time (the flicker sets in after 2-6 hours of uptime), that's not so great. I'd like to have givenit a good review, but it's hosed, and Viewsonic's support hasgotten very unresponsive since I last had a problem with one oftheir monitors. I am reconsidering whether or not to purchaseany of their monitors in the future based on this experience."
4,Reggae,Quality of tunes ok but not great. Original masters of some of these older Reggae songs not great so the later CDs not perfect.
2,Ok product,"I installed it in my focus no problem, build quality looks ok. The problem is that is has created a resonance in my exhaust syatem at certain rpms that was never there before. I should have paid the extra $20 for the Ford one."
2,"This set does not include ""Spanish Harlem.""","I can't believe they assembled 40 original Drifters hits without including ""Spanish Harlem."""
5,BIG STARS,"when you first take a look at this book you think ""oh no, another juvie deliquent book"" but this is not that kind of book. It is interesting and it is from the inside of juvie. it is a VERY good book."
1,This Book BLOWS,Dont ever read this book. I relly hated reading it and it brought bad (porn) images into my head. If a was a parent i would definitly not let my child read this book and i would burn it.It had no plot line and really was a bad story.
2,WARNING: This Book SUCKS,"Ok, the topic on the book isn't all that bad. But the writing totally blows. The dialog is WAY too thought out and not natural. When reading this book I questioned myself: ""Was this book written for 5 year olds??"" The way the book talks about rape is really...just....sad. ""You mean it is still rape if a guy forces you for sex, even if you know them??? Oh my god!"" So this book is written for teens, and it has junk like that in it? That's not even all, just all i can think of at the moment. So why don't you pass this little baby up for something a little more...mature. Decide to read this book and you will either die of boredom, or laugh really hard at how stupidly this book was written. For me, it was a little bit of both."
1,Not as expencted,"The book looks like a good resource to design our kitchen remod. In reality, the book was published almost 15 years ago. Most of the views were dated or not very attractive. I expected there to be some good design guidelines to help layout a new kitchen. It is only a picture book."
1,Disappointed,"I must have clicked on the wrong book of the several I was reviewing. This is not the book I wanted. It has no information about the basics of kitchen layout and design. It consists primarily of pictures that are of limited usefulness for selecting a look (many of the pictures appear to be very dated) nor are they helpful in choosing the size and shape of a kitchen. In fact, the pictures are of poor quality. My advice -- don't waste your money on this book. It is not helpful in any way. We recycled it....."
1,disappointed and can't return item,I was disappointed with this product. It was difficult and messy to apply. I decided to return it only to find out that their return policy only allows for damaged or defective merchandise. Buyer beware! I've since found another product that has a money-back guarantee and yet another that will ship you free samples. My advice is to keep looking.
3,Not meant for severe hair loss,This product probably works really well for people with minimal hair loss but not really well for those with short hair or a buzz cut.
2,Didn't work & smells,"I ordered this product for my thinning hair. Well, I ordered light brown, and was eager to try it out. I applied it, and the first thing that came to mind was ""Halloween makeup"". Seriously, this stuff smells bad, and looks like makeup. For those with bald spots, this might not be for you. For people with scars (small areas), then, yes, this should work. Unfortunately, this is going in the bin marked, tried it, didn't work."
3,"Decent construction, mag pouch does not fit double stack .45 mags.","Size 03. Good construction, but the mag pouch is too tight for a G21 mag. This is not mentioned in the product description."
5,Terrific,"Simply one of the best movies ever made. Sidney plays a well educated, graceful and exceedingly decent teacher of a wild bunch of impoverished English teens. He teaches them a great deal about life and he does it with style and heart. This movie is not to be missed."
3,STUDENTS WAY TOO OLD,"Excellent acting job of Mr. Poitier. Solid writing. Students who are supposed to be FIFTEEN are way, way too old. ALL in their 20's. Shame they couldn't of at least cast a few teenagers."
1,over rated,"This movie seemed to be nothing more than a tool for the advancement of a message. If you hate ""preachy"" movies that attempt to beat a message into you, you'll really hate this one!!"
5,Outstanding Emotional true to life,"This is wonderful drama, of the differences between uneducatedto educated and the warmth and honesty and love, your emotions will be stirred with humor and sadness and kindness and loveyou have to see this movie, it makes you laugh and cry andfeel good .Excellent drama"
5,"To Sir, With Love","I loved this movie since I was a kid. Sidney is always so entertaining. And Lulu is always a pleasure to listen to. These old movies do not have special effects, just people learning to get along with other people and having a mentor like Mr. Poitier as a guide makes the whole experience happy and successful. If you are looking for and old school movie with a good soundtrack, this is your movie."
2,Disappointing,"We bought this for our elderly cat, who, sad to say, has passed on. Many say that it is not recommended for animals, but our last elderly cat loved the heating pad so much... it eased her aches and pains. A reasonable solution to the danger of direct exposure is to put it under the cat bed.In the winter, I have found that my feet hurt when they get too cold, and we live with a low thermostat. Unfortunately, when I tried it for that purpose, it simply did not get warm enough to really make a difference, even on the hot setting. For that reason, I cannot recommend it."
3,"Okay for yogurt making, untested otherwise.","I got this specifically for making yogurt and it's working alright. It's the only thing I've used so it might just be the best heating pad to ever warm a pan of cultured milk. I'm getting a problem with my yogurt being grainy, what this is generally attributed to is uneven heating and the culprit has to be this pad.Seems like it would be great for other heating pad uses."
1,Defective Sunbeam Health At home 756-500 Standard Heating Pad with NEW Arthritic Controller,"I have owned one of these in the past and they worked great. HOWEVER!, this one doesn't even work on medium or low, and the high setting barely gives enough heat that the low should have! Maybe during shipping, packing, storage, manufactoring, I'm not sure where. All I know is it is obvious that it is new as stated, but defective!"
1,Fire,I have had this product for a couple of years now. Today I noticed the smell of an electrical fire and a zap of heat. My heating pad was on fire. I quickly pulled the plug and the fire went out. That was close.
1,Stopped working after 2 months,"I bought this heating pad a couple months ago because it was big and looked like it would cover all the area I needed it to. I have a chronic health condition that causes pain and heat really helps. I also bought this item because it has a lifetime warranty. When it stopped working I contacted the company for a replacement. They informed me I had to pay shipping and handling and needed to ship it with a tracking number. I was not happy. I can buy a new heating pad with shipping cost. They also said they needed a receipt. It's a lifetime warranty why is there a need for a receipt??? I finally gave up, threw the heating pad away and bought a new one,"
4,good,"i read most 5-star and 1-star reviews before i purchased it, and i tried it for 2 days before i wrote this review.i use it beneath my feet to keep my feet warm, it generates enough warmth at the medium level. it stops heating for a while when the temperature gets to certain degree and then when it cools off a little bit it starts heating again, i guess it`s to protect itself from overheating and also use less electricity."
5,No auto-shutoff!,"It is seemingly impossible to find a simple heating pad that doesn't have the auto-shutoff feature that drives me insane. I bought 2 of these but wish I'd bought 10. Great price, simple, even heat. They're perfect."
2,Great cat bed warmer...but not for me!,Bought this pad along with another brand. The arthritic control is a good sounding hype; bit it's really just a bigger control unit that is not any larger or easier to use than other brands. Worse...the unit at the highest setting doesn't get warm enough to help my arthritis. But it's warm enough for my cat.
4,hot stuff,The size of this pad is convenient for use on a knee or shoulder yet it's still large enough for ones lumbar region. The low setting is warm enough for me. I suppose the other two settings are suitable for warming meals or beds.
3,Not what was pictured,"Nice pan, but not what was pictured. I expected it to say Lewis and Clark on bottom, but had some other thing down there. Too much trouble to return."
2,"Slow, poorly executed . . .","I wonder if Mason wrote this novel as a means to shed her reputation as a ""minimalist."" She maintains some of the hallmarks of minimalism, such as an acute attention to the mundane, but violates the category by ""over-reporting"" what happens. I have never read so much about eating, food, and breast-feeding. The unfortunate thing is that the historical details this novel works from are in themselves interesting.The protagonist's ""epiphany"" at the end does not prove overly satisfying. If you would like to read Mason at her best, buy a copy of Shiloh and Other Stories."
2,not recommended,"After having owned a copy of Fighting the World for over 10 years and thinking it was pretty good, I thought it was about time I bought another Manowar album to check out. After reading reviews of albums on Amazon I decided to grab a copy of Kings of Metal, bad move. 3 or 4 tracks feature choirs, which would be okay for intro's maybe, but they drag on for 4 or 5 minutes, one track is some old guy telling a boring medieval story featuring horses and swords, and that Sting of the Bumblebee bass guitar crap is just painful. The rest of the album is okay, although very over produced, but not good enough to keep me interested, I took it back and got a refund. Kings of metal with highly over produced choirs etc? hardly"
1,Terrible,This was a waste of money! The movie makes no since at all. The picture sucks. It looks like a five year old filmed the movie. I dont no where someone came up with this. Its not even a movie. Im mad that i spent three dollars on this. I would not recommend anyone to buy this garbage.
3,"A few fine stories, others so-so","Highsmith's later work is uneven, and this collection from the 1970's is no exception. There are some truly bizarre stories -- including a sci-fi piece (not typical for her) and a dream-like fantasy called ""One for the Islands"" -- that simply do not work at all; and ""The Pond"" is a nasty, depressing tale. However, ""Something You Have to Live With,"" ""A Curious Suicide,"" ""Those Awful Dawns"" and ""Woodrow Wilson's Neck-Tie"" are all vintage Highsmith, and make this collection well worth acquiring. ""Something"" is a very thought-provoking story, and ""Dawns"" is simply shocking; unforgettable.For the record, I've read a lot of Highsmith's short stories -- which poured prolifically from her pen in late career -- and the only uniformly excellent collection is ""Eleven,"" which features first-rate early tales and is, fortunately, still in print."
1,Piece of Garbage,"My unit came in DOA. Will have to RMA it. After getting it in DOA, which is rare as most companies actually test there units before sending them out, I checked out more extensive reviews on other web sites where many complained of the unit working for a period of time (weeks to months) and then just shutting off while they were in the middle of working even though there was no power loss. Others complained of the smell. I fortunately did not experience either of these issues as mine would not even power up at all.There are units from Eaton available for a similar price that are much better quality would recommend these over this unit or its cousins."
3,"I like it, but","The product work well, but I just wish these was more sizes available. Be careful not to get it on healthy skin because this product doesn't doesn't know the difference between dead or healthy skin."
1,Just go buy a new shaver,"I ordered these after finding you can no longer find them in the store. The blades never came, so I tried just replacing the screen and for the most part it pulled out more whiskers than cut. I used to buy the replacement blades and screens in walmart and they would work great. It was like having a new shaver. I don't know where these came from (knock-offs?). For sure they don't work plus I never got the blades that I also payed for."
1,Don't Publish Amateur Writers,I bought this book for a wisdom book club. I did not realize I would be reading work by amateur writers. What a disappointment. The writing is dreadful! I felt I had reverted to correcting papers for a high school creative writing class.
1,Don't buy from Amazon!!!,"It came dried out and just fell apart when opened!!! Never again!!! When I can find it in the store it was fine, but from Amazon it was money down the drain!!"
4,A great Megatron!,"While I am not crazy about his gun mode, I absolutely love Megatron's robot mode. His head resembles the G1 cartoon version of Megatron. Some slight problems - Megatron's head seems pretty small compared to his body. The green color on his ""wings"" seems off with the rest of the figure. Also, lastly the orange on the end of his cannon is even more off than the green.The purple is right on with his coloring scheme as Galvatron. Too bad Takara didn't use this color purple on the reissue of Galvatron rather than the light purple. Overall this figure is worth it if you want a robot version of Megatron. His gun mode is not so appealing, but the robot mode rules!"
4,Queen001,"This blanket is soft, light wieght and warm. Hey! that's just why I ordered it. I guess I got what I wanted. This is a good thing.I would only make one change the next time. I would order another color. White is to hard to take care of and picks up every dirt fiber around. It still was a good buy."
1,Categorically wrong.,"I am very disappointed in this blanket--though some could be considered my fault. I searched soley for ""Electric blankets"" and when this came up over and over, I thought I would try it for the price. It is NOT electric, but that is the category I found it in--and still find it in. ""Queen size, electric blankets only."" Other than that, it is way too expensive for a nonelectric blanket--and probably way too inexpensive had it been electric! I just don't want anyone else to be mistaken. It may work out, but I did not need another regular blanket and it is not very soft. Good luck shopping."
3,Maynard Ferguson: Live in Prague 1968,This DVD is when Maynard was the real deal.The picture and sound quality is OK-not great. They did not have the technology they do today.I would recommend this to any serious jazz musician.
1,They're no good at all!!!,"I think that Megaherz is far behind Rammstein in both lyrics and music. For an example, Gott sein is the worsest song i've ever heard. It doesn't have a good lyrical content."
5,A Great Mystic,"This work reveals many facts not before known of Padre Pio. Basically not only his devotion to God, but also how he suffered at the hands of his own fellow monks. Suprisingly, not all the monks were pleased to have him in their presence. Allegri presents us with intimate view of this holy man. Even Pope John Paul II sought his intervention."
5,Maxine is the greatest,I think Maxine is the greatest woman alive. She is an inspiration to all women out there to think outside the box and don't limit yourself and definitely do not rely on men.
3,"Interesting read, but not that helpful","This book is written as a fictional story of one man's experience navigating the political jungle in a cut-throat corporation. Each chapter tells a bit of the story, with an accompanying analysis that includes ""Game Stats"" (I found those totally useless), the ""Antidote"" and the ""Vaccination"". I found those last two somewhat helpful, since they give you ""power questions"" to ask the person who is playing politics and how to respond. However, the entire time I was reading the book, I kept envisioning an episode of ""Ugly Betty,"" because the situations were so ridiculously exaggerated. In my experiences at corporations large and small, I've never witnessed the situations to the extent they describe, so it was hard for me to relate."
5,"A gorgeous blend of history, culture, and religious insight","National Geographic's lovely Geography Of Religion: Where God Lives, Where Pilgrims Walk opens with a bang - an introduction by Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his daughter the Rev. Mpho Tutu - and continues to present astounding detail and revelations all the way to the Epilogue by His Holiness the Dalai Lama himself. Here are 200 illustrating ranging from photos and examples of sacred art from around the world to maps, discussions of great leaders and faiths of the five great religions, and a timeline of events following their spread around the world. A gorgeous blend of history, culture, and religious insight."
1,Wonderful Movie,WARNING!!!Don't get rooked here on Amazon. I bought this movie on Ebay for ten dollars.I remember this show from when I was a child. It is so wonderful! I don't understand why it is being sold for 2000 dollars though...
5,The best strategic thinking book,"Our professor assigned this book in the DBA reading list. At first I read it because I had to, but I have got to admit that this book really made me think as early as when I was reading the preface. Great book, hard to put it down before finishing it."
2,OK,I probably wouldn't purchase again. The connector broke. I suspect the design is the problem. I would have been better off buying a new phone with the usb connection.
3,live in hawaii? . . don't buy this!,"The radio signal that this clock uses to update its time does not reach Hawaii. you would be better off buying another clock if you don't live within 2000 miles of Colorado. It is still a nice looking clock, and you can set the time manually but it's not worth $50."
3,Did someone order a stripper?,"Yes, this doll does have a very pretty face and hair. Yasmin always seems to be keeping up with Cloe for sluttiness. The outfits looks like it was from a cheap lingire store that specializes in easy-off stripper clothing. She is obviously going to a Bachelor party, rather than a birthday party!"
4,Great Book Must Read,"What would you do if you were arrested for your beliefs? Would you fight back? Run away? These are the choices Esther Rudomin must make.Esther's life dramatically changes when she is forced to separate from some of her family and live on nothing in a concentration camp. It is difficult for Esther to adjust to her surroundings because she used to live in luxury. Her family must survive on what they can get through bartering. That would be so hard for me, not knowing if you can survive another week with the food you have.Read this amazing autobiography The Endless Steppe and discover what it was like in a concentration camp during World War 2.I would recommend this book to people who enjoy autobiographies and survival tales about the past."
4,It really touched me!,"I read the Endless Steppe as a requirement for a seventh grade accelerated language arts class. I really love this book. It's one of the best I've ever read. I thought it was cool because Esther was just a little bit younger than me when the book started, and i had a fun time watching her grow up(you know what I mean by watching)I give it four out of five stars!!!!"
1,Game Won't Initialize,"I bought this game because of the good reviews. It appeared to install OK, but when I tried to start the game, I got an error message saying ""The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142)."" I rebooted my computer twice, and reinstalled the game twice to no avail. I did a Google search on the error, and found that other people were reporting the same error in discussion groups. One person offered a solution that involved changing a video setting, and I tried that. Not only didn't it work, but I began getting Nvidia error messages unrelated to the game because of the settings I changed. I recommend avoiding Pacific Fighters until Microsoft makes a patch available."
1,Buy a better game,"I bought it because of the ratings, but it's not much better than Chuck Yeager's air combat."
3,Warning,"This is a warning to all prospective buyers. This game does not work on any CD or DVD drive that has R or RW capapbilities, you have to have a plain CD/DVD drive to run this game. I found this out the hard way, and now I can't return anything to Best Buy w/o a receipt.Learn from my mistake, make sure you have the proper hardware before buying this game.Don't get me wrong, I've seen this game in action. It's a great game, I just can't play it on my computers."
5,ok,okay the whole mess of toy questions through me off but overall i was very pleased with the collector barbie it looked exactly like the picture and everything. Not to mention it was in mint condition no dents or anything mutilated i am very happy with my purchase.
1,remington TCS-1 Traveler Series Fuzz-Away Fabric Shave,Terrible product. It broke the same day. I didn't return it as it was too much effort! Warning...a waste of money!
3,You get what you pay for...,"With that being said, it is not a bad little gadget to have handy. I had a very particular item of clothing in mind when I ordered this from Amazon, and although it took quite some time and needless to say, patience, the little bugger worked ""ok"".Yes it feels cheap, yes it required plenty of ""cleaning"" as it gets jammed easily and as I mentioned before, you'll need your fair share of elbow grease.I have used it 3 times thus far and it still works. I don't plan on beating the life out of it, so I think it will have a ""to be expected"" life expectancy around my household."
2,Not what I expected,This device doesn't work as well as I expected it to. You have to push really hard and it still doesn't do a very good job. We purchased a lint 'stone' locally from a dry cleaner and it works really well.
2,works sort of,"Considering the cost of this item, I should not have to complain but I will. This product only works if you press on it really hard, and then you still are basically pressing and pressing with minimum results. Word to the wise, invest in a better product or get a new garment."
3,"Still works OK, but . . .","When I first opened the package for this replacement cutter, I thought maybe it was a cheap knockoff. The number of cutting edges was reduced by about a third compared to the original. The foil insert had an eighth-inch thick plastic frame around it which reduced the exposed foil area. Some obvious cost-cutting had occurred here. When I checked with Remington's Customer Service Dept. they confirmed that the changes in the product were factory changes, though no explanation was offered as to why the changes were made. In practice, these parts fit and work OK, but I can't help feeling a little cheated."
4,What I ordered...,"This item is what I ordered and is right on the money, it fits my razor. I like the newer design compaired to the old style. I will order this again!"
2,Wrong Parts,"Cutter didn't fit. Spring didn't fit. Was able to use the foil which, fortunately, was what was bad on mine. Mated my old cutter with new foil...time will tell.Not highly optimistic.DavidUpdate 4/19: Old Cutter with new foil will not shave. Done with that. Guess I'll save by money until I can buy the new, correct replacement for my old Braun 7526's, of which I have two. Both shave great, batteries are about done. I believe they're still the best.David"
5,"SP-62, Remington",Sp-62 Foil and cutter.The price was outstanding and the product was as described. I got a excellent Deal and am satisfied.This item purchased thru Amazon.com.
3,Freddi Fish PC Games 2 for 1,"Getting the two games for the price of one was great. I play these games with my 3 year old granddaughter and she loves them! They are educational, fun, have great graphics and sound, and I played them with my 12 year old grandson when he was her age! I bought them 9 years ago and here I am, 9 years later, buying them and playing them again! That should tell you everything."
4,Joan Rivers,Do you like raunchy comedians? Well JOAN RIVERS - LIVE AT THE LONDON PALLADIUM is the DVD for you. She is just great.
4,Good value,"Not as hilarious as her former show at the London Palladium, relatively speaking, but still very, very funny. This comedienne has very few inhibitions, even at the age of 70+."
5,"this is even better than Chris Rock, or George Carlin, or Carlos Mencia!!","I am a total media wh*0re. I have thousands of videos. i accidently saw this on HBO some time ago and just couldnt stop watching it. if your into comedy, this one performance by the old bat is top notch along with performances like Chris rock on the last tour ( never scared?) , or Carlin when he was in top form.. or Carlos Mencia on his best days. really, Im a totally hetero male! 30+ years old, workout.. mechanic, im a normal guy! .. i would never, have never, ever watched any joan rivers show. i mean, who would? thats for broads and chicks. but let me tell you, ANY guy or girl will find this performance absoultely hilarious! its that good!"
5,I LOVE this comforter,This comforter is sooooo pretty I was really excited when I opened it...The picture does this comforter no justice..It is reversible and both sides are really really pretty and the variety of colors matches pretty much every sheet set that I have. The blanket is very comfortable...I would definately highly recommend this product.
3,Damage Control,"The problem with this movie is that sounds too much as a ""damage control"" operation. There isn't a problem with the press or the media here, but only a wacky crazy kid with aspirations of grandeur. Sounds familiar? Yeah, the same they said about Harvey Lee Oswald. But the story is compelling, and the drama is rampant, and some actors are brilliant. Christiansen gives the act of a life, and only good things can be expected from him (if only doesn't give to George Lucas money never again)."
3,Glass broken too late,"As a true story it's a good movie. They could have went deeper in Glass's mind to let us know why he really decided to make up stories. What he went through personally. Haden Christensen's acting is very good, very convincing. Worth seeing."
3,good movie,"i thought this movie was very good, story was slightly disturbing, but all in all a good movie."
5,She is differant but so beautiful,"She is very differant looking for a African, like her long hair and green eyes. But again what is wrong with looking differant. If all barbie dolls looked the same it would not be fun collecting them. She is beautiful with her big earings and necklace. Her dress is the best part with the African prints. I have been looking for a long time to find an African doll for my collection. But now I have I got her and she is so beautiful and looks so good with my 15 dolls of the world barbies."
4,Great for making your own toys or fixing an old favorite,"My Miniature Schnauzers love squeaky toys and when they are new and never played with the better but buying them new toys all the time is expensive. Trust me they know when the toy is new and with three of them of course they want to be the first to play with the new toy.So instead of buying them new toys all the time I make them a toy using one or two of these squeakers, some bating and sewing them up into a nice, sturdy piece of material. So what you end up with is a pillow, squeaker toy which didn't cost me five or ten bucks.This is also great for fixing older toys which have lost their squeaker due to sharp little teeth punching a hole in the original squeaker.Other uses for these squeakers is for making baby toys. Using the same concept just add the squeaker into either a favorite stuffed animal or make a nice pillow toy for your baby. Babies love toys that make noise just as much as puppies!"
2,Not worth it,"The squeakers were good until I put them in a toy and then they lost their squeak within 2 days. The larger squeakers may be better, but I haven't tried them."
2,"Small squeaker = 30 squeaks, at most",Not sure if size matters when it comes to squeakers but the small ones I purchased are very thin and getting only about 20-30 squeaks before dying. Pack of 6 lasted my doggies 3 days. Maybe the larger ones are thicker and last longer.
3,Description insufficient,"If you replace dog sqeekers every day, you would understand what is provided.As I am unfamiliar with the product, I was looking for a replacement squeeker for a rubber ducky and will glue the squeeker to the bottom of the ducky. There is no way to know from teh description that this material is meant to fit inside a container and toy squeekers are apparently not provided any more as they are dangerous. Please provide a use picture or describe the product usage more adaquately."
5,ANNIE AND DAVE AT THEIR BEST,"WHAT A GREAT CD!! ALL OF THE HITS AND TWO NEW SONGS, WHICH ARE SUPERB. ANNIE'S VOICE ON THE NEW TRACKS IS AMAZING - I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS, SHE DOES HER BEST WORK WITH DAVE PRODUCING HER. I MEAN, DIVA WAS A CLASSIC, BUT MEDUSA AND BARE WERE JUST SO-SO. I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE INCLUDED ""SEXCRIME""AND A COUPLE SONGS FROM THE MUCH OVERLOOKED ""WE TOO ARE ONE"" CD, BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING ON A SINGLE DISC COLLECTION. BUY IT AND ENJOY."
2,DOESN'T HAVE PARADOX 9,GOOD BOOK BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE PARADOX 9WORDPERFECT OFFICE 2000 DOES AND MUCH MORE ISBN0-7645-3241-3LOOK IT UP IM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT SAYS SO
5,got the spirit,"Condidtion of this 26 year old first edition was VG... Any one with an interest in the asian area should read this, for a greater understanding of the social and religious aspects of the area. This was a new item!!!"
1,unable to connect,i am actually only giving this one star because i cant even watch it. amazon cant connect although they were able to connect to bill me for this film. Hopfully i will get to see it before the rental period is up
3,Oridnary Tale,"Robert Lipsyte delivers an ordinary tale of a Native American boxer who travels to the big city in order to pursue a more extravagant life than that which he leads in the reservation, in his story, The Brave. This story is too similar to the first to be considered amazing. Sonny encounters practically the same dilemmas that Alfred Brooks did and the only real difference is that this story follows a Native American rather than an African American. The same issues of racism are tackled and the over-all story is one heard over and over again and Lipsyte does not introduce enough of his own style and twists to make it anything more than a decent book. For the young reader, I would suggest this in that it delivers a good message, but for those seeking any kind of challenge or real entertainment, this book is not for you."
5,"lost package, but then got my trucks","So... unfortunately had to order the item twice, but Amazon Customer Support helped me out and I got my trucks. I'm that much closer to seriously injuring myself now!"
2,"Half-serious, half-ridiculous cliffhanger for fans","Radio's ""Lamont Cranston"" had a fine sense of justice, a sly sense of humor, and ""the power to cloud men's minds."" In the serial version, however, The Shadow terrorizes the underworld, takes no nonsense from anyone, and is plainly visible in hat and cloak. Although Victor Jory plays Cranston earnestly, the serial just barely takes itself seriously: when the hammy villain speaks his lines with an overdone sneer, or when Jory sneaks up on some gangsters DISGUISED AS A TREE, it's hard to accept the film as a legitimate drama. But there are some good moments, including very clever staging for the villain, who materializes as a vaporous beam of light. Serial fans will enjoy this most, and Jory's performance is the best part of the show (he's got The Shadow's trademark laugh down cold!)."
2,Nothing special,"A far, far cry from the excitment of the radio series. Ordinary in production values and story line, the series is distinguished only by Jory's solid performance and his chillingly accurate laugh. If you want to sample the best of the cliffhangers go to Spy Smasher."
2,More serial tomfoolery from James Horne,"In this sillyass but amusing serial the Shadow does not have invisibility as he did in the radio series. This is given to the Black Tiger a peevish, prissy old fogey who fancies himself a leader of men. With numbskull underlings this fancy is not difficult to achieve and it is most amusing to hear these swaggering tough guys give out with a lot of sheepish ""Yes sirs"" to the Black Tiger's demands. As usual Horne gets a lot of comic mileage with the antics of the villains. Still one wonders why the Shadow was not made invisible so he could ""cloud men's minds"". Perhaps the producer did not want to spend the extra time and money on special effects or perhaps Horne himself felt that with his bad guys there wasn't any minds out there to cloud. 2 1/2 stars."
1,one star is too high,"This is the biggest waste of money and time reading I have ever experienced. Had to read this book and use for a Social & Behavioral science undergrad degree and literally felt it did not teach me a thing about theory. WHY? BECAUSE IT IS SOOOOO BADLY WRITTEN! These social scientists should have hired a writer to express their thoughts and research work. I am not a stranger to philosophy, but this....wow.........It might as well have been written in Japanese (which I dont speak)"
5,I love the look!,"I got the earrings and pendent as a present for myself, I love them! The colors are fantastic! They are primarily yellow when in the house but outside the hues change to match your surroundings. I am looking at getting matching sets for my daughter-in-law!"
3,A little discolored,"The pendent arrived in a timely fashion, but unlike the picture was mildly yellow. This is not just the lighting, I took it outside just to make sure. The color is bearable, and only extremely noticable again dark color shirts. I plan on keeping it, but I will have to limit wearing it with light shirts, shame."
2,Not so fabulous,"This really seemed like my kind of book. I suggested it to my book group and was excited when it was chosen. I happily purchased it and started to read... At first I couldn't figure out what was going on, a book this length I normally polish off in a day or two. After a week, I was still only a third of the way through. I struggled through to the end, but was not thrilled. It was boring. I didn't know or care enough to keep the five different women straight in my mind. I am donating my copy to the library, and do not plan on reading anymore books by Radish... When in the mood for some good girl books (chick-lit as I'm told it is called now), I'll happily pick Jane Green or Sophie Kinsella instead."
3,Just Okay...,I loved the idea of a Traveling Funeral & after reading the cover I decided to try out this book. Like other reviewers at first I was really into the story & the characters. Along their journey I found myself getting bored! It felt like I was re-reading the same things over & over. There were thoughts/sentances that seemed to go on forever. I actually had to push myself to get through the last few chapters.I loved the idea & how very different women were able to become friends. I did like the begining & the ending. I just wish the rest of the book had some substance as well.
1,Most poorly written book I have ever read.,The ideas are good and if you tell someone about the plot it does sound interesting. So just read the summary and save yourself from wasting your valuable reading time. I've read two Kris Radish books now; I give up. Her writing is embarrassingly bad.
4,Fabulous!!!,"The best word to describe the whole traveling funeral. It took a bit for me to really get engrossed in the book, but by the time they left Florida, I was hooked.Annie dies, and wants five of her best friends to have a traveling funeral for her. But is it really for her or for them? Are funerals for the living or dead? You decide. Anyway, so she has stops planned for them, where they are to throw a bit of her ashes.Along the way they meet new people, discover things about Annie they never knew, and discover things about themselves they didn't know or had forgotten.Good book, a bit tedious at times for me, but still a thumbs up!"
2,Dissatisfied Customer!,When I received the game there were pieces missing from the box. I immediately attempted to contact the vendor but no one ever responded. I've used Amazon a few times before to order various things but this will be my last time! I paid too much for the game as it is (I knowingly accepted this when I ordered it) but only then to discover that pieces were missing from the box and no one cared enough to even contact me left me pretty angry!
2,"excuse me, several good songs are missing",Some of the better songs from the movie are missing. Remember that scene where you first see the school and music plays in the background? That music is not on the album. It's called 'Head over Heals' by Tears for Fears. Remember that scene where Donnie's little sister performs on stage? That music is not on the album. It's called 'Notorious' by Duran Duran. There are other good songs that were played in the movie which also do not appear on the album. This album misleads the public. You will be disappointed if you expected to hear those songs.
3,Song during credits,"Is the song during the credits of the movie called ""For Whom the Bells Tolls,"" and if so, does anyone know who it is performed by? thanks!"
2,Disappointed,"I agree with the review by a Mr. Greenhut: the best song (played once during the film and again in the end credits)was left off the CD. It was something of an operatic aria, very beautiful and well suited to the film. I will never understand why labels leave treasures like that off CDs (unless they're too cheap to get the rights). I'm very disappointed in an otherwise ho-hum CD."
3,Great concept flawed by predictability,"I've never seen this movie, but I was informed of the gorgeous, cold nature found within its soundtrack. Being a fan of dark, beautiful music, I couldn't resist purchasing it. I do like the gloomy, futuristic soundscapes created by Michael Andrews. However, when he attempts to compose actual ""music"", it is very hackneyed. You have probably heard all of the chord progressions found here in a hundred other songs, and it is easy to predict each individual change. This, of course, makes for a fairly boring listen after a while. The cover of the Tears for Fears song ""Mad World"" is good, but highly overrated by many reviewers. Overall, I would like to give this soundtrack a higher rating for the great original concept behind it, but the actual result is highly flawed. Fans of experimental ambient sounds will like this, but if you are someone who is picky about originality in composition, you many find yourself bored with this CD rather quickly."
5,eerie/beautiful,"My review title hints at my usual prerequisites for a soundtrack.This debut!by Andrews has it in spades.The movie is probably my favorite of last year and I now own the dvd,but a large portion of its' charm is due to its' haunting score. I haven't seen the cd in the stores anywhere so on the second viewing of the film,(and knowing by then the music was a must have),I ran to Amazon to make sure it was available.Thank the gods it is!That funeral dirge/gothic lament track is worth the price alone.Sooo beeautiful.I used to be a rabid soundtrack collector,but for the past three or four years that habit dropped off and was forgotten, I guess because nothing much grabbed me when I saw a film--until this one.It's the first soundtrack purchase I've made in a long time."
5,Donnie Darko,"I was drawn to buy this CD because of hearing Michael's arrangement and Gary Jules rendition of ""Mad World"" which was originally recorded by Tears for Fears way back when. I glad I did. The music was written as the underscore for a Science Fiction movie by the same name and now I really want to see this film. The music is other worldly, ethereal and strange in a good way!"
2,...,"i searched several cd stored to get this cd RIGHT AWAY (go instant gratification go!!) so i could listen to the song ""mad world"" wich wraps up donnie darko. wile the cd in fact have both mad world and mad worlds remix on it. all the rest of the songs were 30 second sond bites. its not something you can really sit and listen to. its more like something you zoom halfway through the one track to get to the part you liked, then skip over thre tracks, and zoom through half of the one you thought you settled on.yet given the fact i couldnt find mad world online. im still happy i bought it, if just for that one song"
2,Didn't clean my platen,The platen had been screwed up years ago by someone trying to shrink wrap without release paper. It cleaned up somewhat but not enough to satisfy me. It might work well for others.
3,Bucharest--the last bastion of the loup garou,"They've existed for 5000 years and been hunted by humans. But, in Bucharest, their society is more complex. The people believe in old legends--and accordingly, the Alpha male must change mates every 7 years.Vivian, who is the next in line, isn't interested in the Alpha male at all. She stumbles upon Aidan who is human or 'meat' and falls for him. The question is--with the pack opposing, can she keep her freedom and him? Prophecies say she is the new hope--but she believes not in destiny but making her own way.The story's interesting and the backgrounds are lovely. I don't think I've ever seen a film done in Bucharest before, so the scenery is fresh. And, for a movie, some parts of the story are as well. Still, I felt like the story could have been done a bit tighter and I had to ask someone who read the book what the title really meant--that's something of a critical piece of information to misunderstand."
1,So off the mark,Okay so I might be a little bias having read the book before seeing this movie but I just thought it was awful! So much of want made the book amazing was changed. It just didn't have the same feel to it. I didn't like the plot or how the characters were changed and although it had some great cinematography I just found it dull.Save your self the hassle and get the book instead.
3,Warewolf story,"If you are a fan of the warewolf movies, this one may be for you. I was hoping for much better production though especially with actors like Hugh Dancy and Olivier Martinez. Story is just too predictable and the happy ending totally spoiled the experience. For light entertainment, this one is just right. Do not expect too much and you will be fine. I did like the music in this movie. My sincere compliments to composers and performers."
3,Average werewolf film.,"This was an alright movie, not outstanding by any means, but not poorly made either. It is worth about five dollars at most."
1,would give it 0 stars...but,"This movie and the book are completely different. And not in a forgivable sense. Usually movies are different only on slight details that are needed, like plot changes to make the story make sense when in the book it would have been an internal dialoge.No, in this movie everything changed, from being set in New England to Romania. From Vivian being in highschool to now she works in a chocolate shop. etc etc. Another problem, there is no chocolate in the book, its a metaphor. And they completely changed the entire ending, and not for the better in my opinion.As someone who loved this book growing up I'm glad that I didn't waste any money on seeing this movie."
2,Terrible Movie,"After hearing about the book and the movie, I had decided to see the movie first. Even without knowing how it compared to the book, I thought the movie was terrible. It was jumpy, and it didn't focus on one thing. It was a bit confusing, and wasn't at all one certain genre. I wanted to see more romance than I did.And then I read the book.The book was great, of course. But the movie DESTROYED it. They changed EVERYTHING, including practically the whole plotline. I am sorry to say I am very disappointed in this film."
2,Not much to recommend...,"Wow. They got all the cliches in the romance montage. The playing in the rain, the watching him play with kids (aw, he'll be a great dad), the playing in the fountain... Yep not a hack ""We're so in love"" scene left out. The logical ending point wasn't actually the end. It just kept going. I'm not sure why either, not to improve it. Not a great movie."
4,Love this movie but book better!,If you haven't read the book I HIGHLY recommend it. So much better then the movie (always is) but I still like this movie and would recommend it if you're into werewolves and such.On a side note what the heck is up with Amazon and always lowering their prices after buying an item?! I went through an outside company because Amazon wanted $30+ now down to $21? I would have paid that price and not the $30+ just because I have prime and don't have to worry about sellers NOT shipping the items to me.
1,Book and Movie Don't Mesh,"Have you ever read a book that you LOVE and then they turn it into a movie that just doesn't seem to match? That's what they did with Blood and Chocolate.The movie ruined the book, and that's all there is to it.I LOVED the book, and I had read it more than one time before I had heard that it was being turned into a movie. I was really excited, but then tonight I actually saw the movie.At the end, for the last 5 minutes, my eyes were open REALLY wide and my mouth was wide open because I couldn't believe what was happening. The ending was almost the complete opposite of the ending in the book...which I happened to like.If you like the book, don't see the movie.If you've seen the movie, read the book and then yell at the movie for being so different."
2,They werent really werewolves...,"just regular wolves, and very easily killed. And why, except for two characters, were all of them teenagers? This movie was not as bad as I was expecting, but it could have been so much better."
1,Destroy All Copies,"A terrible movie is bad enough, but a terrible movie ""based on"" a wonderful book (by which they mean: uses the same title and character names) is a crime."
4,Great Movie!,My daughter really wanted this movie for her psp and I found it here for a good price. I recieved it within the week and she was watching it the night it came. It has a great plot and is scary to a degree but mostly a love story. It has a good plot and would recommend it to anyone.
2,blood and chocolate movie,"if the movie wasn't based on a book it would be amazing, but it is, and it was NOWHERE NEAR as good as the book. there were BARELY ANY similarities at all. the book was WAAYYY better."
2,"""Destiny"" made me write this.","My theory on these guys is that they are not really Christian. They are heathens trying to make the religion look bad by putting out bland, soulless funk-lite and warbling smug, simplistic lyrics that are shallower than Jerry Lee Lewis' gene pool. The contemporary Christian scene needs more charisma, creativity and humor if it's going to reach people. The Katinas come up short on all three counts; they need to listen to that still, small voice and think carefully about whether music is really their calling."
3,Something's missing from this album.,"I'm puzzled by my own reaction to this album. I think that ""The Legacy"" was a great album, and despite much of the praise it has received, I think it still doesn't get as much credit as it deserves for being truly worthy of consideration as one of the very best thrash albums - and not a Metallica rip-off at all.I think Chuck Billy is one of the best vocalists in the genre, and his contributions to ""Practice"" are very good, and there are some great guitar solos on this album. Normally, great vocals and great guitar solos are an indicator of a really good heavy metal album, but I found the everything else on this album to be rather bland, as though the songs are just framing the guitar solos. Maybe I expected more of the speed riffing and crisp changes that the earlier albums had, but most of this album just sounds like kind of ""run-of-the-mill"" metal."
5,"If you play guitar and you're good, you'll want this CD.",The best f*ck*n riffs and the best melody are in these songs. Sins of Omission is an awesome song and this music makes you want to go mental.
1,won't order from this place again,"These came very quickly (as they should, with Amazon Prime), but the bottle was packaged very loosely inside a cardboard box. The outside of the bottle was kind of dirty and worn looking, but the seal was intact, so I thought the capsules would be okay. Instead, they were all coated with powder. There was enough that it had to be from more than the one broken capsule that was easily visible. VERY disappointed, as my regular brick and mortar store still doesn't have them in, and this was a better price. Not sure if I want to try ordering from another company (through Amazon) or not."
3,It Works for Me!,"I bought this with my Canon camera and I really like it. I just logged in to buy two more for friends and saw the bad reviews. At first, it did not charge, but after a few cycles, it started working. Put the batteries in, let them run down, do it again. Then it works. Good luck."
1,DIdn't work,Bought the battery charger pack to go on my trip to hawaii with the new camera and the charger never worked so had to buy other batteries the whole time as I couldnt' use the batteries or charger purchased here. Am returning this item.. it is probably just this particular unit that is faulty so wouldn't base your opinion on this one review unless you see many other reviews that state their's didn't work either
3,Battery charger,Ther were no instructions with this product. That's OK except there is no way to tell when the batteries are fully charged.
1,"Terrible batteries, charger basically worthless","This is by far the worst performing charger/battery combo I have ever bought. Together, they just don't work -- batteries don't charge at all for me. Using the batteries in a known-good charger is hardly better. These batteries act as if they are 10 years old and worn out, holding only a small fraction of the charge they should. I'm amazed that Amazon promoted this -- I wouldn't recommend this product at any price."
4,Tight Album&Band,"King's X was always a Band that I truly dug back in the day for being about there Musicianship Sounding trendy.this Album packs alot of Punch from start to finish.""Over My Head""&""I'll Never be the Same"" are my Jams on this Album.this band to me is very Underrated."
1,If Only I could load the game...,"Unfortunately this game would not load out of the box. After contacting UBI Soft support and answering several times that my system meets or exceeds their published minimum requirements, they provided me with a long list of fixes. After trying the first few with no success I gave up. I did however load and unload this software three times before giving up.I have loaded and played with great success Call of Duty, Call of Duty II, Medal of Honor with all of the expansion packs, Far Cry, Doom3 and had no such problems. I have returned the game for replacement or refund without any Luck so far. Gaming is for entertainment not work. Stay tuned and avoid this game if your specs are marginal. I have a 2.4 Ghz, 512 Ram, NVidia GeForce4 MX420, 64MB, running Windows XP."
3,more of the same crap,"I got one question to pose to the ww2 game developers of today. Can you play from the axis side? The answer is almost always, and unequivocably, NO. The only fps game that allows you to commit this apparent hubris, is battlefield 1942, which i have played to the bone. If you don't wanna play as some goodie goodie g.i., fightin' them evil krauts or japs, then you're outta luck. For once i'd like the option of playing as a mean imperial japanese marine, or a tough grizzled german paratrooper. Too much to ask?"
4,Good old fashion ' Lets go get 'em',This one I wasn't sold on at first but then had some down time and after getting into it ended up saying to myself well by golly this isn't that bad after all....if you like this genre then you'll get the hang of it and speaking for myself as a singleplayer gamer and baby boomer I still have to let the other guys do all the flankng business but some episodes they are as dumb as hammers but they do lay down a good base fire so you can sneak around and silence those pesky MG42s and armor killers....really not a bad game once you get into it and the singleplayer action is not as short-lived as some of the newer games like CoD and BF Bad Company...great games but more geared to online play...this one has hours of action...and with the prices now not a bad addition to your FPS collection.And by the way it installs on Win7 in a jiffy with no issues on my laptop...wish I could say that for others.
1,Prettiest faucet that doesn't work,"I bought this item in October 2010, but did not get it installed until late November - early December. Right out of the box it worked like a champ. Then the water flow started to diminish. I am on well water, but have a water softening unit. I have little to no mineral build up on any of my other faucets in the house. I went through all the troubleshooting tips in the manual. I have adequate water pressure to the faucet, but it just won't flow out of the head. I called Kohler's customer service and they were very helpful. They sent me an entire new head assembly at no charge. I replaced the head and it worked great. That was in late February. Here it is mid-April and the faucet has started acting up again. The water pressure coming out of the head is pitiful at best. Since I cannot return it to Amazon, I will try to get my money back through Kohler. This is an extremely pricey item for it to work so poorly. Oh well... lesson learned."
1,I have ordered it twice and still I didn't receive it,"I've ordered this product at the beginning of June. It should have arrived in July. In August, I hadn't received it. I called Amazon.com and complained about this. I was told that the package had probably been lost and that a new package would be sent to me as soon as possible which should arrive at the end of August. It's September and I still don't have my ordered book. What is happening??"
1,not the original artists,"This cd is a total waste of money. The only good song on the cd is the sublime theme song... joe cocker's ""with a little help from my friends"" you might as well dish out the extra (dollar amount) or so and get 4 more cd's with the 5 disc set, it has the original artists (including the theme song) and this one does not....enough said."
2,Not that good,I can't give a completely accurate review of this book because i never finished it. I got a little less than half way through it when I said the heck with it. I just didn't find it that interesting and I thought the charaterzation was a little off. I would sugggest reading X-men Doctor Doom Chaos Engine book 1 it is awsome. well thats my 2 cents
4,Killing Britney,I got this book b/c the title seemed interesting and the book is. Throughout the book I thought it was one person and the ending was very unexpecting to me.. I highly recommend this book
4,One Star for the Hot Girl on the Cover...,"Two stars for it taking place in my hometown Madison, WI. And one little star for the title, ""Killing Britney."" Very catchy in the times of Mrs. Spears Ferderline."
1,poorly written,"The title of the book should be ""Writing in Sumer before the invention of cuneiform"". The author's erudition shows everywhere in this book, however, the text is much too chatty and I found it extremely tedious (and I am very interested in the topic). At half its length it would have been too long. Trivialities are being treated in epic detail. Many statements are obscure and unsupported by evidence. Because of my deep interest I read the whole book, but it was a waste of time. It seems that I had to give it one star, but I would have preferred to rate it with no stars."
2,I got options for ya,"Most people seem pretty disappointed by this book; on the other hand, I am very satisfied with this book: Before Writing, Volume I: From Counting to Cuneiform, by Denise Schmandt-Besserat. It refutes the very thesis that cuneiform developed out of nothing, instead, her theory is that it developed ""from an archaic counting device."" The foreword is by an eminent Assyriologist, and there's a volume II which is basically all the data (pictures of counting tokens), so the reader can judge for themself. If that weren't enough, she also wrote ""'How Writing Came About' [which] draws material from both volumes to present Schmandt-Besserat's theory for a wide public and classroom audience. Based on the analysis and interpretation of a selection of 8,000 tokens or counters from 116 sites in Iran, Iraq, the Levant, and Turkey, it documents the immediate precursor of the cuneiform script."" Anyone interested in this topic should be satisfied..."
3,Short on Substance,"Unlike others with favorable reviews, I found this book short on true substance. There was lots of filler, phrases being repeated throughout the book, but it fell short of actually laying out a plan for becoming successful as a commercial realtor. The info made available that was specific to a plan was broad and general, not what a novice needs. If you are seeking a book that provides specifics on launching a successful career then search elsewhere. If you just need a shot of motivational hype, this book will suit you fine."
5,a dog tail,"The book Winn-dixie is a really good book. I really enjoyed it. I mostly enjoyed it because of Winn-dixie he is such a good dog. He can smile,make a lot of friends, and he knows how to make people laugh. His owner is a girl named Opal and her dad is a preacher. Around the middle of the book you get to meet a lot of Opal and Winn-dixie's friends. if you want to figure out what happens next read the book."
5,A Dog can change your Life!,"In the book ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" Opal is a sad 10-year-old girl, who doesn't have any friends until a dog changes her whole life. First Opal is sad because her mom left her when she was a baby. Her mom left her because she hated being a Preacher's wife. Next, when Opal's dad asks her to go to the Winn-Dixie grocery store to pick him up some stuff. Opal finds a big dog rummaging through the fruit section of the store. She takes the dog home and names him Winn-Dixie. From that point on her whole life changes. Thirdly, as soon as Winn-Dixie starts becoming Opal's pet she begins to have a lot of friends. She starts to have a lot of friends because Winn-Dixie is a nice, loving dog that has a big smile. Finally, everyone in Naomi, Florida (her town) knows that Opal doesn't have a family at all. She reaches out to everyone by telling them what it is like to grow up without a mother. As you can see Opal's life was completed when Winn-Dixie came into her new life."
5,A WONDERFUL STORY . ..,"I was made aware of this book because it is on the William Allen White list for my 3rd grade son. He really wanted to read it but it was a bit higher than his reading level so the teacher suggested us reading it together . . . it was a very inspiring story that we will always remember. Winn Dixie proved to be a very best friend to little India Opal, who was becoming curious about the mother who left her. Through the story with Winn-Dixie, Opal meets many new friends and finds out how deep love can really be. . .An outstanding selection . . ."
5,Enchanting,"The beautifully written novel is magical, moving and captivating. Will appeal to many elementary students."
4,Because Of Winn-Dixie,I think Because of Winn-Dixie is a good book for 4th graders that can tolerate tears.
4,because of winn-dixie,"Enchanting, charming book. An excellent and inspiring read for young and old alike. A beautiful, absorbing tale of a child with her new found friend."
5,AWESOME READER!,"This book, was short but sweet, all of her adventures were so heartfelt and touching! I really hope the author of this book decides to continue the adventures of Winn-Dixie and India Opal, because i would hope the adventures would never end."
4,Because of Winn-Dixie,"Opal has found her first friend in Naomi, and he is a dog! She doesn't have much friends but she finds alot more on her journey! Opal can't barely remember her mother when she left her. She finds friends that have made big mistakes in there life, who are full of stories, people who have lost something valueable in their life, and friends that can't be handled!! This is a good book full of questions and good connections to yoursef or the world. The great thing about this book is you can follow along and not get confused by mysteries or brain teesers! You can relate to this book probably for everybody because it has stories, sad feelings, and happy moments! I am sure you will love this book from making friends to being loyal to your surroundings! The dog will change everything in Opal's life!!"
5,You're Never Too Old for Winn-Dixie!,"Although Because of Winn-Dixie is recommended for children 8-12, I feel you can never be too old for Winn-Dixie! I read it when I was 10, and then read it again this year, and I'm 14. Because of Winn-Dixie is an extremely easy and delightful read, and can draw you into the story very quickly. Because of Winn-Dixie is a very short, simple, and sweet read and can easily be finished within a day! I recommend Because of Winn-Dixie for children 8 or 9 and up, or any child that can read a chapter book easily. However, this is also a perfect story to read aloud to children of any age!"
3,maybe you'll like it more than me if you read it.,"I think it's half and half because of these two reasons: I think it's a bad book because they didn't put what happened to someone that Opal(main character)loved and missed very much.I think it's a good book because it has alot to do with feelings about Opal and how she solved them with cool solutions. The # 1 reason why I like this story is because I love when they put the main character a girl, because I'm a girl. :)"
2,Because of Winn-Dixie,"""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is a heartwarming tale that is relatively good, until it reaches Chapter 11."
1,Because of Winn-Dixie,It was borning because it was so long and it was didn't tell alot of detail the movie is better than than yhe book.
3,Review By N.H,"If you are intrested in books,then you could read this exciting book.This book is a really good book.And it's about this girl named Opal and this dog named Winn-Dixie.And Opal savedWinn-Dixie from going to the dog pound because Winn-Dixie was behaving very wildly in the store.And in this story Winn-Dixie will help Opal find alot of new friends,old friends,and young friends!!!!And this story book is a fiction book.If you like dogs and meeting new friends this is a very good book for you to read to your friends,read by yourself,and to read to your family."
4,how a stray dog wins friends and influeces people,"Name your dog Albertsons because you found him there?A lonely little girl finds a stray dog who can smile.This preacher's daughter has been to India ( was named after it), but lost her mother very early.Sadness and loneliness give way to new friends andgood times as Winn-Dixie wins friends her in the Florida summer.The book is well written and a heart string plucker.Most children and grandparents should enjoy the stories here."
3,The Best Book Review In The World!,"In the story Because Of Winn-Dixie, the main character Opal, changes significantly. First, at the beginning of the story she was so shy that she would barley talk to anyone. For example, if someone would say hi to her she would just smile at them and not say anything back. Then, one day Opal went to the store and there was a stray dog. She ended up taking it home and naming it Winn-Dixie. Opal named it Winn-Dixie because that was the name of the store that she found him at. They did everything together, and became best friends. All because of Winn-Dixie, Opal becomes so much more confident with herself. Now she has more friends, and talks to people that she doesn't even know. Also, Opal helped out other people by becoming more confident with herself. Take Gloria Dump for example, no one would even talk to her, then Opal came to her house one day and now Gloria too has friends. I think that Opal has become a new person, do you?"
5,"irresistable, heartwarming book","""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is the kind of book you recommend to all your friends because you want everyone to experience the story, the characters and the feelings they evoke. Through her found mutt, the main character gets to know the new town to which she has moved, greets people she probably would not have gotten to know and learns more about her absent mother from her emotionally distant father. That dog is a miracle worker. Each person I have recommended this book to has thanked me and gushed about it. Take the time to add it to your list...any age would enjoy it."
4,A charming tale of a big dog,"I thought Winn-Dixie was a really cool character, and I loved the supermarket name idea. This dog charmed his way through the neibourhood, resulting in a large party for all, bringing the townspeople together. I loved it!"
4,Book vs. Movie,"Because Of Winn Dixie is a good book with a certain warmth and familiarity. For those that have seen the movie but have not read the book, I recommend experiencing both. The book and movie are quite similar to each other, but I would recommend the book over the movie. After reading the book, you have a certain idea what Winn Dixie looks like. After seeing the movie however, your ideas over what EVERYTHING looks like will be different. I personally think the book conveys more of the emotions and feelings the author wanted to get through. I highly recommend this book."
4,Because of Winn-Dixie Review,"WoW, I think this book was awesome. Kate DiCamillo is an excellent writer. If you like a good laugh and dogs this is the book for you. You read about India Opal Buloni and her dog Winn-Dixie's adventures. It all started when Opal went to Winn-Dixie to get some white rice, mac-and-cheese, two tomatoes for her dad, the preacher. Noone expected her to come back with a dog though. The problem is that Opal is new to her town Naomi, Florida. She's just a ten year old girl trying to fit in. I personally really enjoyed the book:)~*AsHleY*~"
4,"Good, but...","Loved this book, but...HATE that the phrase ""Winn-Dixie and me..."" is used so frequently. I understand that some might think that the use of these words adds to the charm of the book, but the core readers of the book are beginners at grammar. But maybe I'm bein' too picky."
3,quick but damaged,The book came very quickly but I was disappointed to see that the cover and some of the pages were slightly damaged.
5,Catch that dog! -from Russia,"I like this book because it was very funny. I bet anyone would like toread this book because anyone can relate to the problems in the book.Reading this book helped me learn not to judge a person before you meet them. Also, you should try to make friends more often. This book was addicting. I could not stop reading it! I hope you read this book and it's just as addicting for you."
2,Criticism,"The very first word that I looked up (aver) was not in it. I aver that I was greatly disappointed in this dictionary, and feel it contributes to the ""dumbing down"" of our society. Perhaps its incredibly low price should have given me forewarning of its content (or lack there of)."
3,Has he lost his mind?,"This is Pete Townshend's musical adaptation of the Ted Hughes children's story of the same name. Unfortunately, the story as told through the songs doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense. In fact, you have to read the liner notes to make heads or tails of the storyline. Aside from the unclear story, the songs themselves aren't very memorable. Not bad, just not that great. Although this album is based on a children's story, I don't think children will enjoy it at all. The movieThe Iron Giantis a much better adaptation of the same source material. Watch that instead of listening to this album."
4,Bigger isn't always better,"I purchased a Britax roundabout for my son at 4 months old when he outgrew his infant carrier. I love everything about it. When he turned one and is facing forward, we decided to get the Marathon so we would now have 2 seats and the Marathon should last us through his booster years. The added mechanisms on the straps do helps position them correctly but are cumbersome. I am also having difficulty with the strap adjustment lever. If you don't pull on it at the right angle, you can't adjust it. Love the one button on the roundabout especially when it was rear facing. The strap did not get stuck between the seat and the car seat."
2,"Good car seat for SMALL child, but not for larger child","I have 2 of these car seats. One for my 16 month old daughter and one for my 2 1/2 year old son. I am going to go to babies r us tomorrow to return the seat for my son. He has no problem pulling the lever to adjust his harness and remove himself from the car seat. Every time we go any where I have to stop him from pulling the shoulder straps off himself. And after paying over $200 for the seat it is a little ridiculous that they madethe adjustment in a place that any child could get to and loosen his harness to get out. I am sure it won't be long until he teaches his sister how to get out of hers. I recommend this seat for infants, but do not for toddlers."
3,Marathon FAILED infact rear facing LATCH test!!,"I was going to purchase a Marathon because of all the hype. If you are considering this car seat you should read the article in Consumer Reports May 2005 www.consumereports.org that found that at 30 mph the Marathong FAILED using the Latch b/c the infant's head smashed into the back seat. They test seats more rigorously than Federal Standards....everyone says this seat is so safe, but if an infant smashes its head into the back seat then you are looking at a serious case of shaken baby syndrome. no thanks. the roundabout did better, but still had some issues with infant rear facing. check out the report before you spend the $$."
5,Awesome,This is a beautiful selection of songs performed with Sarah Brightman's glorious voice. The combined talents of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music and Sarah's voice make this the kind of CD that one wants to listen to over and over without tiring of it.
3,Same songs as Volume 1??,"This is a decent album, covering some of Sarah's best songs from ALW. I just don't think much effort was put into this. Maybe it was an afterthough to grab some Christmas money. Complaint #1: It repeats songs from the ALW collection Volume 1! These repetitions include: The Phantom of the Opera, Love Changes Everything, and Don't Cry For Me Argentina (This time in Spanish! Whoopee!) Complaint #2: Think of Me is lifted right off the Phantom soundtrack from 18 years ago. Could she be trying to remind us that she did this first (and best!) now that the movie is out? No effort there either.Sarah's voice is as beautiful as ever, and if you don't have volume 1, this is one to consider. I own ALL of Sarah's cd's up to this point, so I'm not new to her music. But I still don't see the purpose of releasing multiple versions of the same song [see also ""Classics"" a great album, but only four songs are actualy new, four are re-recorded, and the rest are rehashed from other albums]."
4,Manon by Jules Massenet,"It is an excellent presentation of Massenet's opera Manon. Of course, the dream cast of Natalie Dessay and Rolando Villazon contributes enormously to the enjoyment of this DVD. The production is first-class and depicts the life of these women, who are paid for by wealthy suiters, more realistically than in any other production.Highly recommended."
4,"The sequel to ""Master Wolf""","When I read this book I had just finishing ""Master Wolf,"" the previous book in the four book series of the adventures of Mika and his wolf Tam. Throughout these books there are many different creatures and many adventures. It is a quick and entertaining book. I highly recommend it to beginner readers of fantasy. Be sure to read ""Master Wolf"" first (Greyhawk Adventures, No. 3) or it won't make much sense."
1,A big deception here,"The size of 10' by 20' in bold print in the title for this item is very missleading. The actual size you will recieve is 9'4"" by 19'6"". This is a fact I missed in the fine print. The sellers of these tarps should be forced to state the ""finished size"" in the title......not the ""cut size"" which is larger than the product you will actualy recieve."
5,Game we always love to play,"If you don't have any of the other games, the killer bunnie games are rather black humor games about collecting bunnies to get carrots to win the game...but the bunnies run into all sorts of problems like nuclear warheads, or F-18 Hornet and smaller things like a kitchen whisk or a chain saw. It is all in good fun, there are also cards to protect your bunnies or help reduce the damage that can be done to them. It is always fun to see the new cards when you add to your orginal deck."
2,Vacuum Gauge,"Gauge works, but is inaccurate compared to 2 other gauges that are known accuracy. Send email to maunfacturer but no answer."
2,Not as pictured,I purchased the Shimmer powder as pictured and received the Shimmer Bloc which is made up of 4 different colors and is not what I wanted.
4,nice cross - lousy chain,"I bought this cross and necklace for my son for his Chrismation into the Orthodox church. It's a beautiful byzantine style cross that looks as good as the pictures online. The chain was a disappointment, as it is so thin and flimsy it looks like it would fall apart if you stared at it too hard. In less than two weeks, it had indeed broke and will have to be replaced by another, much more sturdy chain. Beautiful cross, but don't count on the chain lasting."
3,for shorter women and/or with a garter belt,"These seem much less likely to run (strong material) than sheer thigh highs and have a lovely pattern. The top doesn't ""Pinch"" like some do.However, as a tall-ish woman (5'8"") with slightly heavy legs (I'm a size 8/10 and 150 lbs) - they seemed too short - barely mid thigh, easily falling to lower thigh - they look great and are probably great with a garter belt, and are a steal for the price. However, I have to recommend these WITH a garter belt for either shorter women or women with skinnier legs than I have (to be fair mine ARE heavy, despite by medium sized proportions). So I won't be reordering (unless I lose 15 lbs!)"
4,"The ""cage experience""","This cage is made of a good quality plastic. When you open the box you will find abag with lots of little plastic pieces. If you have a ton patience and time you will find yourself using up both very soon trying to assemble.But with hope that there will be only one time I will have to do this,I have forged ahead...........wrooong! The top lid got stuck at one pointwhile trying to undo, the whole cage came apart. I have 2 ""other"" cagesand now can appreciate their practical design."
5,One of my favorite Rush albums.,"I really like this CD. There are so many little memorable melodies spread throughout that just stick in your head. Sure, it doesn't knock you over like a locomotive, but the performance here is much more subtle and nuanced. You won't pick these nuances up on your first listen. But they're there in the form of really cool chord changes or fragments of melody that catch your ear. Plus, the playing is uniformly strong. Honestly, I think this CD features some of the band's best songs in terms of composition, tension/release dynamics, and sheer beauty. For proof, see ""The Pass,"" ""Presto,"" ""Available Light,"" etc."
5,The best underdog in the entire Rush catalog,"I may be slightly biased towasrds this album, as it is one of three that I grew up listening to (others being Roll the Bones and A Show of Hands). Trying to assume an umbiased stance (which is near impossible), I do feel that this album has been slighed, as many feel it is a ""transitional"" work, which it is, and is the first of their non-keyboard albums.Some people focus on the lyrics a great deal, which is almost like judging a book by it's cover. The musical content represented here is easily some of the best the band has ever offered up. Yes, The Pass ""is the only decent song,"" but that's from a lyrical point of view. Just listen to Superconductor, Presto, or Scars. This is one of the musical talent showcase albums, for sure. I also consider this to be one of their few, in a sense, ""complete"" albums, as one song flows easily into another. It's one piece of wood with somewhat similar cuts. I highly recomment it."
4,Excellent additional songs,"I agree with other reviewers, I also buy the singles because I am a big fan of the artist and that the singles contain previously unreleased songs. In this event, Jewel has added 2 truly excellent tracks. I feel like Jewel has gone back to her roots in these songs. I docked one star as I am not a massive fan of Standing Still. I do not feel it is part of her best work but still like it a lot. It just hasn't got the rawness that so much of early Jewel contains and that is the Jewel I really enjoy. Long Slow Slide is really trancing and gorgeous to listen to. Stephenville is fun and honest and I just love it. It reminds me of 'Sometimes it be that way'. It is like she is just telling this story about herself in this lovely ballad. Long slow slide is more about someone else. It is mysterious and poetic and soft. Stephenville is more up beat and enjoyable to listen to.Recommend you buy it, in addition to other singles and of course, the album 'This Way'"
1,poor quality,shortly (about 3 weeks) after I received the leather case the clip started riping out of the back....it appears to be riveted only to a piece of cardboard....don't waste your money.....
4,great accessory,"This is a very useful accessory. It leaves about quarter inch of the gps exposed, but does a good job of protecting the screen."
4,Good quality,A nice little case that has held up well. It was reasonably priced and has served it purpose. Now moving on to the cell phone for navigation.
1,3.5 Inch Garmin Carrying Case,"I don't know why they even offer this product because it is much too small to fit the Garmin Nuvi, and I don't even know if they make a smaller GPS than the Nuvi. I bought 3 as gifts and returned them for the larger case, which is wonderful. I am still waiting for a refund from Agent Frugal, the vendor I purchased from. At first he gave me the wrong PO Box, and the Post Office returned my return. He gave me a different PO Box, but I still have not received my refund. The post office did not return it to me, so I assume it was delivered. I would be leary of ordering from this vendor. It's a shame because both deliveries were very prompt, but I'm still due a refund for the first order."
1,Garmin Carrying Case,"This case is too small for a Garmin 200W. ""W"" stands for wide. The case should not be recommended for a ""wide"" Garmin. I returned the item."
5,great case,This holds my system when I am not using it or when I leave the car and take my system with me. It is very secure and my system does not get scratched.
2,Carrying Case for Nuvi,The carrying case does not have a strap or zipper or anyway to secure the nuvi in place to prevent it from falling out of the case. I bought the case with the goal of keeping the screen from getting scratched and the case can do that provided the nuvi stays in the case. The Garmin case did not work for me. I bought a small camera carrying case with a zipper at Wal Mart for about $5 that does the job that I needed.
3,Buy the Tom Tom Case,"I have the Garmin case for my Nuvi 2000. It is open on one end and I am always afraid that my GPS will fall out.Yesterday a purchased the case that is made for the Tom Tom One, after seeing it at a store.This case fits the small nuvis perfectly and protects the unit all around with a wrap around zipper that fully encloses the case.Check it out on the Amazon site. It is a much better alternative."
3,Garmin cover,I found the one which I had which was borrowed from a friend so I returned the product. I didn't open the package but am usually very pleased with purchases so feel this will be the same quality.
2,Carrying Case Not for Me,"Since my GPS will pretty much stay in my car, this won't be too useful for me. If the shipping costs hadn't nearly doubled the cost, I'd feel better about this product; however, it isn't worth the total cost.Took retailer a while to ship the product, too. I was hoping their timeframe for cancelling a non-filled order would lapse and I wouldn't have to buy this. It shipped and the cost of returning would be more than the value of the case.If you will be carrying your GPS around, it is a great way to protect it from damage. A tight fit, so there's no room for anything but the GPS."
2,Not pleased with Amazon performance,"I ordered a garmin nuvi 205 and also a protective case for the nuvi. The garmin nuvi 205 was fine, but the package the protective case came in had already been opened. It was probably sent back to Amazon by someone else, and Amazon passed it on to me. I thought that was VERY poor customer service. I will be careful from now on if I ever order from Amazon again. I am very disappointed with Amazon. Shame on you! Now get your act together."
5,Wonderful! Delightful! I smiled a lot..,"The storyline is great and the characters are rich, likeable andenjoyable. But this book separates itself from other ""westerns""with the humor. The twins Becky and Jenny(and their dolls bibbie and bonnie) are a riot. The stuff they do to their governesses is histerical yet believable.You want to reach out and hug them. Maybe being a grandma makes it more real for me but I just loved them. They fit well into the story. In fact the storyline works around them. Jared's growth from the sour, self centered soldier to the tender doting daddy and the evolution of his romance with kitty warms the heart. And Kitty is the spunkiest heroine you'll see. A real MacKenzie gal......This book was much more enjoyable than I expected."
3,Cuts nice at first.....,"These blades fit the 5 1/2 Skil saw, I wish there were more blades available for finish carpentry in this size. This blade starts off great but as with all steel blades about halfway through the stack of material (I'm a pro, cut stacks of plywood) it starts screaming! Eventually start ripping little hairs out the finer veneer, so great out of the gate and in a pinch for a few boards, but pro users will have bleeding ears and a throbbing head at the end of the day."
4,Thought-provoking,"I found this an interesting, albeit Jingoistic, account of the sharp increase in the corporate ""single points of failure"" and critical dependencies. It is worth reading if for no other reason than to get a better feel for how tenuous and time-critical our 1st world supply lines are. We have a more efficient economy these days. It is also far more brittle.I found the latter half of the book more interesting, especially the author's recommendations. They are worth serious consideration. Sadly, however, I suspect that companies won't pay any attention to them until after a crisis."
2,Crap,"If you're looking to buy a cheap iron, don't go THIS cheap.The spring is way too tight...so it ""snaps"" pretty hard. Doesn't heat overly well and just looks like cheap crap.Go for the Vidal Sassoon one a little bit more expensive."
5,Very nice LCD monitor cover!,"Strangely, 17"" LCD monitor covers seem to be hard to find at least for a reasonable price, but the Cables Unlimited dust cover purchased from Amazon has worked out just fine."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappoined with this cover. On one hand, the colors are different from those in the pictured item: the cover is not gray but whitish (destined to become very dirty soon) and the trim isn't white but blue (in my case, it doesn't match anything). On the other hand, perhaps pretending to be ""universal"", it is too large: the width is 19 inches, too much for a 17-inch lcd; the sides are slanted, from 5 to 10 inches (I could fit 2 lcd's there!). The material is nice, though a bit too synthetic; I'd prefer a fabric that could breathe. All in all, unsatisfied. I'm considering returning but perhaps is too much work for so little money ..."
4,great song,"THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD CD.THE OPENING SONG IS VERY STRONG,IF YOU LIKE THAT dirty south - bounce soundPICK IT UP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Gardening ""outside the box""","Holly Bloom wishes to do something as well as her mom and older siblings can. What does Holly want? To grow her own garden.Alas, her family's flowers flourish, but Holly's seedlings simply won't grow. Not willing to give up, Holly keeps trying--until she finally figures out how to have a perfect garden of her own.Gentle illustrations in colored pencil and acrylic paint evoke Holly's struggle and celebrate her unique solution.Young readers facing a difficult goal will be encouraged to think outside the box, just like Holly Bloom."
5,Inheritance-an old house or a new mystery,"The author has a unique way of blending the past and the present. She presents the main characters, deaf girls-cousins, as being just as capable as anyone else. They have great imaginations and solve the mystery with clear thinking. She also presents deafness as just another characteristic and not an unsurmountable challenge-it is accepted as a difference, but not something to be embarrassed about. She shows that not all people approach being deaf in the same way-some sign, some vocalize, and hearing aids are not viewed any differently than glasses. I highly recommend this book."
2,Strap is crap.,"I had a watch just like this many years ago but with the band that clips. The watch was great and had it for a long time. I was happy to see they still made this style. Sadly, this buckle band is terrible with cheap grommets. It is also VERY short. The say unisex, but the strap makes it for women and children only. What a bummer."
3,Poor man's bluesy... it's so French,One must be French or have Gaul in one's blood to appreciate this medley of nostalgia songs. I recommend it as a house-party background songs.
4,Awesome travel guide,"For planning a trip to the Philippines, one would be hard pressed to find a more complete book. It does a very thorough job of covering the entire country. What is most appreciated, is the detail provided about transportation. You don't really need to rely on taxis and private tour guides to criss-cross the country. The detail about buses in Manila is incredible. In addition, the book is loaded with maps -- although, I recommend purchasing a separate map of Manila itself. If the book has any shortcoming, it would be in covering the hotels within each city. Not enough of them get included. But then, that would require another 300 pages or the complexity and sole-purpose dedication of a Michelin Guide."
2,I don't know why so many people are giving such positive reviews!,"I really don't know why everyone is giving this book five stars. I purchased this book based on the recommendations I saw here, despite the fact it is a year older than the latest Lonely Planet. I do have the Lonely Planet guide that Jens Peters wrote from years ago, so I figured I'd go with his latest. I was wrong. I found his suggestions and assessments incomplete compared to the recent LP and the book is peppered with advertisements, which make me question whether or not these ads influence his writing. I have returned this book and purchased the latest LP Philippines. I'm very happy with my decision. With a dearth of updated Philippines travel guides in the first place, I'd go with LP... at least until Moon Guides update their version!"
2,Stereotyped,"The police are supposed to protect us. Why are they represented as stupid and tragically pompous? E.g, why do they arm themselves with just pistols when they expect to face criminals armed with machine guns and rockets? Why does a detective go alone to confront a mafioso in his den? Shouldn't the public protectors be required to have at least an IQ of 100?"
4,Surprising,"Wasn't quite sure what to expect from this one. Knew of Karl Denson from some jams with the Allman Brothers and Widespread Panic. So I tried it and I really liked it. Good funky jazz-rock. I don't have too much other frame of reference to compare to; they are very unique, and quite good."
5,Dead Zone 2,Best season of all. I had trouble turning it off. Very good. This season has 22 episodes opposed to 11-13 like the other four season. Worth the money.
5,Beware: addictive!,"Another excellent series based on the characters from the Stephen King novel (see review from series one). Johnny is again trying to save the world and find justice through his hyperactive `dead zone', this time with a little help from other friends.A new threat looms overhead from the evil Stillson who's running for senator (also in 'Simply Irresistable'), and his link to Armageddon. Johnny `visions' also become public knowledge. You may find this series slightly `darker' than the first.By the way, you get to see a guest appearance of an old friend of Anthony Hall's friend from The Breakfast Club - Ally Sheedy."
5,Excellent TV,If you like Scifi this is great!! I have watched all 4 seasons and am waiting for more.
5,Change one small thing and all of life changes...,"There's a definite theme to the second season that was only hinted at in the first -- if even the smallest fact changes, it can make all the difference.My favorite episodes are Precipitate, which reminded me to start donating blood again; Cabin Pressure, which encourages even the non-believers to keep an open mind; and The Mountain, where the phrase ""there's still time"" becomes an important new theme for the series.If my husband and I are any judge, this is a series that will resonate with the fans of the multiple Joss Whedon's series (Buffy, Angel, Firefly) in that there are always interesting plot lines & devices, and the witty repartee keeps things fun and moving. Terrific series!"
5,THE GREATEST BOOK ON MONEY ACCUMULATION I'VE EVER READ!!,"I've read many books over the years on wealth accumulation, financial planning, money management, and a number of other topics pertaining to money. I'VE NEVER READ ANYTHING SO POWERFUL AS ""BREAKING THE MONEY BARRIERS"" IN MY LIFE!!! I almost didn't buy it based on a couple of negative reviews, but a friend of mine told me this book is a ""must read"". Well, I read it and it has changed my life and finances. When the other books gave me a direction, ""Breaking The Money Barriers"" filled in all the pieces for me. I would strongly urge everyone to read and benefit from the wealth of knowledge this author has to share."
3,Too expensive for what it is,The metal band/frame encapsulating the glass vials is solid and of good quality.However the vials are held in place by the flimsy foam pads and they aren't particularly nice nor provide a very secure hold.The colors of the sand aren't particularly pretty either (though fairly close to the photo)- somehow reminiscent of neon or kindergarten colors. I'd prefer them to be warmer and more subdued.
5,Excellent!,"There's a time when you simply don't want to drink a tea with any flavor in it at all. For the past few months I've been drinking all sorts of flavored tea: Earl Grey, Earl Grey with vanilla, tea with berry, tea with mango. Then I got tired of drinking flavored tea and decided to try this.This was actually a gift. I didn't want to open it at first because the packaging was kind of dowdy. But I wanted to try a tea without any extraneous flavors at all and decided to try it anyway.The result surprised me. This was a very full bodied tea with a very strong taste. It was very good and just what I needed after drinking all that flavored tea; finally a strong tea without any berries or anything.So, if a very strong tasting tea is what you want, I highly recommend this."
1,Very dissatisfied,"Was very excited to have an inexpensive docking station for my iPod, but it is very poor quality. I can forgive the mediocre speaker quality, afterall it is a clock radio, but the alarms are so hard to set!!! The radio reception is awful. I can't even get the strongest FM station in town to come in clearly. The worst part is the blue background display. To sleep, I have to turn the display toward the wall to keep a blue glow from projecting accross the room. Heaven help if I actually want to see what time it is in the middle of the night. It takes a while for my eyes to adjust to the display in the dark, and usually looking at the thing in the dark wakes me up more consistently than the alarms do! It stays unplugged more than not, and I usually have to get out the owners manual again because the time is hard to set. BOO HISS iMode!!!"
2,Crushed,"I should have known better than to buy a first book written under a pseudonym when they tell you that it is written under pseudonym in the author bio. Although the book had its moments, it was mostly flat and unimaginative. The premise seemed to offer so much, but I was let down. Actually, I had a hard time finishing it, which is rare for me."
3,Cute but Unfulfilling.,"There are definitely some laughs out there in this one. The premise is fantastic and the costumes and haircuts are superb. Will Ferrell is always entertaining and humorous but I thought the plot fell flat. To me, the chauvinism of the news team was bogus and unrealistic. Of course, as is the case in everything Hollywood puts out, the female lead (Applegate) has all of the talent and the men around her are just dumb fools. Such a view is merely misandric fantasy and I, for one, am tired of men being portrayed as oxes on film. It's worth seeing but I did not think it was great."
1,Not very good at all,"What a piece of crap. I have loved Will in the past, but this movie just isn't funny. The only saving grace is that Christina Applegate is gorgeous and has to carry the movie. The only funny parts is the anchorman fight and Jack Black punting the dog. A major letdown of a movie. I liken it to Adam Sandler and his bomb Little Nicky. It just seems unfunny and forced."
4,the great american songbook collection,I boiught the great american songbook collection for my mother for christmas. It is not my taste as I prefer the original Rod Stewart but my mother was so delighted with it I don't think I have ever bought her anything so successful.
4,A Departure,"When I first bought this CD (Without hearing anything from it, I might add), I really didn't take to it much. I had just gotten ""A Worm's Life"" the week before, and liked it quite a bit. After a couple listenings, I began catching onto the satirical wit and heavy beats on this CD, though, and now it's in heavy rotation in my car. I like all kinds of music, and that probably had a part in my being able to tolerate the Dummies' new style. If all you like is guitar / folk rock, then don't get this CD."
1,Oi,"This was a fine band, upon a time, with interesting, even profound lyrics... what happened? 2 words: A Shame. Make that 3: A Damn Shame."
2,disappointed - sounds like bad imitations of other bands,What happened to Roberts - sounds like he's on a bad trip to somewhere. What lyrics.
3,Don't drop....,"Don't drop acid to this album. The Dummies have really lost it this time. How do you go from singing about Superman, to totally nonsensical songs sung in a voice that seems to be a mixture of a voice box and serious testicle problems? If you want weird look somewhere else, this one has gone well beyond the twilight zones' boundaries.Note to the Dummies; stop doing drugs, you seriously can't handle them."
2,Inconsistant album has a few moments...,"I saw the video for ""Keep a Lid on Things"" as a fluke. It came on during a commercial in it's entirety as a promo for the album. I thought the song was great. MAJOR hook. I went out a bought it and after listening to the whole album twice, I found only two or three songs that I actually enjoyed. ""Keep a lid on things"" is really the only song that shakes your ass, so I taped that one tune and sold the CD back to the store. A part of me has to give CTD credit for making a ballsy move like this album. They almost caught it, almost did it right. Maybe next time..."
4,"well, it's different!","Don't expect MMM... here, this time Crash Test Dummies went for a modern, electronic, 'mature' sound. Although surprising (and ...strange) the new album plays well (better than 'A worm's life', in my opinion) and Ellen Reid's voice is simply great. Maybe Brad should step down from lead singer and use his (great) baritone voice as backup for Ellen... (just an idea). Fans won't be disappointed, supporting the Dummies courage in being different. As for those who only know MMM MMM MMM... go for 'God shuffled his feet', this has nothing to do with it."
1,Don't Buy This One,"This album, when compared to their previous albums, is a complete let down. I've given it a couple of listenings, but half-way through each song, I'm already skiping to the next. Save yourself the money and don't buy this album."
2,Inconsistent schlock,"I know the CTDs are supposed to be a light hearted band, but this album has some laughable tracks on it. ""I want to par-tay!"" is the most ridiculous of all. If you are starting off with the Crash Test Dummies, try one of their earlier albums. This one, quite frankly, sucks."
1,Biased Opinion that Skirts the Facts,"Writing my term paper on Hirohito, I decided I wanted to have as many sources as possible to insure the validity of my work. Reading several books, I came to realise that although the supposed all-powerful leader of Japan, the military got out of Hirohito's power. A pacifist himself, he did not wish such war for Japan. Edward Behr would have us believe he was a conniving war-lord, hidden all this time by his 'image-makers'. There is one thing I'd like to see: what Behr, or any of us would have done in the same situation. A good book should give us a non-biased description of what happened, and help us to see what the situation was really like for those involved. It's frankly a waste of paper."
1,Talking Heads talk about Cartoons,"What a complete letdown. Various individuals, either connected with the making of cartoons or historians/students of the form talk about the cartoon industry's enlistment in the war effort of WWII. Rather than letting the viewer see them for him or herself, we get about three minutes of uninteresting babbling and 30 seconds of film clip. The unanswered question is: ""Where can we see the actual cartoons?"" I feel that my money was wasted, I'd certainly never watch this ""collection"" more than once."
5,Sister Fidelma books,"As usual, Peter Tremayne pulls you into the far past and the gripping world of Sister Fidelma for another fast paced mystery. I love his work."
4,An engaging read,"""Yes I Can"" by Loretta Scott is a very visceral read. Loretta is a very descriptive writer and her narrative draws you in, making you feel as if you were there with her amongst all her experiences. This account of her journey to the Middle East to serve in the Gulf War, her experiences there, and her return to civilian life, intimately details the journey of the human spirit forever seeking a higher reality as an anchor amongst the chaos that is War and the uncertainties that making a life can present. Indeed empowering material."
5,they just keep getting better.......,"well from what I've heard of them, this is their best. Anyone that thinks they are a Metallica sound-alike is completely wrong. Testament and metallica, in my opinion have two completely different styles. And I like both of the bands. Souls of Black has got to be one of the best thrash albums I've ever heard. And there's some pretty tough competition there, with Metallica's Ride the Lightning and Master of puppets, Megadeth's Rust in peace, and Slayer's Seasons. It's hard to pick a favorite of these albums, but Souls of Black is it."
4,good but not the best,"Testament has been my favorite metal band ever. Even though I loved Megadeth and Manowar too much at the time, I've always had a special love in Testament. It's mostly because of Alex Skolnick, who is one of Satriani's students, that created his own style and licks , without copying Satriani's. (Testament has never been the same after he left). and also Peterson, Clemente and Christian were monsters at their instruments, with Billy and his killing vocal, creating incredible music and lyrics. so why I gave 4 stars to this album?? There are masterpieces like ""Souls of Black"", ""Legacy"" and ""Seven Days of May"" in this album but, there are two or three songs that resembles each other. This album is worth to buy but not perfect as ""the new order"" and ""practice what you preach"""
1,"""Testament"" 2-edged name for a Band going down","If you don't know testament, you might like this album : The sound is clean, the riffs are cool, the singing is... a little annoying sometimes but it is quite good. Now if you know previous work from Testament, this is just Boring : same receipe once again, 4th album and never been blessed by creativity... The intro is quite impressing, classical guitars, ethnic feeling... but it last for 20 seconds maybe ? Not really worth buying it. Unless you want to stand at the burial of this band and say ""i was fan number one ! I had all their albums. They really were the best..."""
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:It's not good as a spoof, it's certainly not good on its own merits, it doesn't offer enough sleaze to be campy fun (like, say, Prison Heat) and above all else it's just kind of boring--stay away from Girls in Prison at all costs."
2,Be careful,"Although these enameled bowls perfectly match the traditional Corelle tableware, they are made of a very different material, and the lids are not very sturdy. I sent my set back to Amazon for a product refund."
4,Pretty Good,"I received this book this morning for Christmas, my mom and I went through it looking at all the different brands we buy. It is a good little guide I can fit in my purse. The only complaint I have is that we live in a fairly rural area and I have never seen a number of these products. I'm not sure if they are from a different part of the country (I know the author is from California, I live in Pennsylvania) or if we just have a poorly stocked grocery store (Price Chopper, which isn't in the book) It might be nice to see a review of how well some of these products work, particularly the cleaning ones, in a future edition. I'm all for getting the greener products, but only if they sill work, otherwise it's pointless."
1,Absolutely worthless,"I bought this product because I assumed the name ""No Bite"" meant that it would be effective for nail biting. I've applied it up to twice a day and it might as well be water. There's almost no taste to it whatsoever and leaving soap on my nails would be more of a deterrant than this. I thought because I bought it in a beauty supply store and it was relatively expensive that it would be an effective nail biting deterrant but it was a complete waste of money."
1,disappointed buyer,"Initally, I was estactic to have found the a seller who actually had the CD and the book so bought with no hesitation. however, to my surprise the book was awful... I was really disappointed once I received the book because unlike the seller discription of the book there was no CD enclosed which had everything to do with my reasons for buying the book. The book felt as though it had food or some sort of grit all over the book and being that I'm somewhat of a ""Germaphobe"" I was disgusted. I could have returned the book but because I spent so little for it I threw it away.So, I guess what I could say is that the seller didn't lie about having the book I was looking for- for sale."
5,Even Better Than Before!,"This album, the followup to 1994's epochal ""Rubberneck"" is a seven-years-in-the-making classic that shows the Toadies haven't aged a bit in the last few years. Although there are some different things on this album, like a couple of slower songs, a more ""polished"" feel and some added piano on a couple of tracks, it rocks through and through. From the opening blast of ""Plane Crash"" to the beautiful ending, ""Dollskin,"" this album is a classic. Far better than anything out there right now. Best tracks ""You'll Come Down,"" ""Sweetness,"" ""Jigsaw Girl,"" and everything else~"
5,This CD is....,"...the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool. Very good. It is of their best work."
3,Toadies wheres the innovation?,"This album is good for what should be expected ofit , good rock n roll. But don't expect no revolution. It is basically ""Rubberneck Part II"" Push The Hand sounds very familiar too ""I come from the water"". But its worth buying for sure. Dan."
4,great alt-Rock,"This is a great cd. great 90's sound. if you were into alt stuff like PJ, Soundgarden, AIC or the like, you will probably like this cd. While 'Rubberneck' was great, this CD isnt a bad follow up by any means. Tracks like ""Plane Crash"", ""Hell Below..."", ""Little Sin"" and ""youll come down"" are great Rocking songs. Then they have the slower paced tracks like """"What we have to Steal"" and ""jigsaw Girl"" to balance out a really good CD that would (unfortunately) be their last.. Must have right along side of 'Rubberneck' if into that genre of music. a grunge era classic! 4.3.."
3,Bettre Than I Expected,"Not bad for a Syfy Channel original movie, which are usually pretty bad. The effects were toned down a bit and that's good in this case. The usual Syfy movie effects are so obviosuly generated by cheap computer programs that they are laughable. So this was awelcome surprise.The acting is not horrroble as it normally is with Syfy movies, but Charisma Carpenter is basically reprising her role from Angel as Cordelia after sahe started having the visions. So it wasn't much of a stretch. Corin Nemic is cast as an unliable, self centered jerk...a role that I imagine comes naturally to him.This sin't a movie that woudl have gotten good critic reviews or would have done well at the box office, but for a tv movie, it's not bed. Try to catch it for free on Syfy though. They seem to air it once every two months or so."
2,bad screw slot placement.,"I purchased this bracket hoping to mount a 2.5"" laptop hard drive in a conventional 3.5"" bay in a desktop case. Initially it looked like it was going to work perfectly, as it did in the pictures but when I began to attach the bracket to my hard drive it immediately became apparent that my hard drives screw holes were not lining up with the slots on the rails. the rails were simply not long enough to accommodate the hard drive in any way. They were essentially useless. The hard drive I was attempting to mount was not an off brand either, it was a Western Digital Scorpio Black WD1600BEKT 160GB 7200 RPM Internal Notebook Hard Drive. I am in Iraq now and the backets are at my girlfriends house or else I would measure and give the dimensions of the slots. I'm sorry this review isn't more helpful."
5,Great little coffee maker,"Bought this about six months ago to replace my old Melitta - so far, works like a champ, is quiet, and is easy to clean. I'm happy to recommend it."
4,Electric Moka Espresso Maker,"I just received this product and have been using for the last week. It seems well made. The only complaint I have at this point is that the water temperature does not get hot enough. It is convenient, and I do have the stove top model as well, but, I was hoping this would be able to make up a piping hot cup of espresso without resorting to a zap in the micro."
1,Leaks ...,"I'm getting ready to research ""How to Return"" ... the coffee maker brews coffee fine but the upper half leaks (from day 1). I see no cracks so I'm guessing there's some other type of problem."
2,You can do better,"We were eager to find a good electric espresso maker. This Delonghi EMK6 Alicia Electric is not the best choice. Sure, it will make your espresso. But the plastic top feels flimsy. The whole unit feels flimsy. I am also wary of fresh espresso sitting in a plastic chamber. If you're going to buy one of these machines, buy the Bialetti ""Easy Cafe. More expensive, but durable and a great performer."
4,out of pocket,"I have boiled it twice as per manufacturers instructions and it no longer works because of the different electric current strength in the UK which is not mentioned in the sales details on the web site, so is only suitable for the States or Canada . I have purchased three of these machines!!. The solution for my situation ?"
3,Good concept - bad components,The produced coffee contains coffee powder: the coffee container is made of thin aluminium and leaks downwards and upwards because of a sieve top which gets deformed by the steam pression and lets pass the powder. And aluminium is suspected to cause breast cancer.
1,Terrible Movie,"From start to finish a total waste of time. I viewed this movie with some of the single women from my church including a recently married woman, we were all appalled at how desparate this ""Pamela"" was note to the director not all women waiting on God are that desparate. The so called Christian principals in this movie were laughable. At the end of the movie I found myself apologizing to my guests for wasting their time."
3,ok movie,this movie wasnt what i was hoping forbut it is a ok movie. its worth buyingand watching if u can get it reallycheap.
4,Long Lost Video: FOUND!!!!,"According to sources like IMDB it appears this was never released on video or DVD, however that's not right. This is the only release of this ultra rare screwball comedy and it was on the long defunct VidAmerica Label.Directed by Roger Donaldson, who went on to much bigger projects, this nutty little film is a gently amusing gangster parody - that deserves a wider audience. The nice performances and sharp direction make this a very decent little flick. Check it out!"
2,Don't buy it blind,"The chapters are very uneven, as you might expect with 34 authors. A couple are well written but most are poor -- too terse, little context, poor writing. Better to look in an appropriate graduate text."
1,Watching this film can kill off brain cells!!!!,"Wow. Where can I start. This movie was horrible. Thats why it kills me that there are so many 5 star reviews. What did you people do? Just turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to the fact that this movie was mega-crap!!! People are just saying this movie is good because TI is in it. Thats not a good enough reason!! Sorry, the plot, premise and acting was horrific. The dialogue downright ridiculous. You would have to have a billion dead braincells to enjoy this film!!! TI needs to stick to rappin'. He may be the king of mc'ing but he is the peasant of acting. Sorry, it just wasn't that great and I can't afford too loose any more braincells discussing it!!"
5,The Kids Are In Charge of the Music,"I don't watch the O.C. I have nothing against it, I just never seem to see it. But I always hear things about how good the music is, so I figured I'd check out this soundtrack.Awesome. They put the kids in charge. Of Montreal?!? Stars?!? How did the hipsters land that job of Music Supervisor? However they did, we can be grateful.Lots of times these days, the best place to hear and discover new great music is on TV shows and on Commercials (you know, besides the internet). I don't know when MTV is gonna catch on already!In the meantime, soundtrack slike this will have to pave the way. Next year's season, look out for Apollo Sunshine, School for the Dead, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, and the Lucksmiths. I betcha."
4,Not your regular TV Series Soundtrack!,"I love watching the show and love even more that I can listen to the music anytime I want. I was watching some special features from the first season and they had this 'music of the oc' feature; and what I really like about the music selection process is that it's selected based on the emotions and feelings of a particular scene, not just whats on the 'pop charts' at the moment and who wants to pay out tv show to have it aired even though it has nothing to do with the scene! The OC music really connects you with the show and it's a CD that you won't just listen to for a few weeks and put away."
4,Great soundtrack,"As a fan of the first four soundtracks, I continue to be impressed by number five. The songs are more upbeat than the first four. Loved acoustic version of ""California"" and the cover of ""Forever Young"""
5,Music from the O.C. 5,This has lots of great music from the later season. A good variety with something for everyone. Sounds like the soundtrack to my highschool years.
3,"Heavy on Mentoring Mantra, Light on Biblical Content","Perhaps my view of this book was biased by my reading of ""As Iron Sharpens Iron"" by Hendricks. His book is also on mentoring, and is far superior to this one. This volume seems to come more from the standpoint of a mentoring enthusiast rather than a saint who is set on building godly, life-transforming relationships with members of the same sex.While overusing the term ""mentoring,"" Biehl does give some very helpful points for developing a mentoring program in the local church. Rather than appointing mentors to protégés, he suggests developing lists of persons willing to serve in each capacity. Personal chemistry and mutual attraction then would work to bring the two together.Hendricks work is much stronger in its treatment of mentoring. I recommend it as a first choice in learning more about this important, long-neglected biblical practice."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for any small business","""Organize Your Books In 6 Easy Steps"" is a must have for any small business owner. The ""easy-to-read"" writting style of Donna Murphy is an excellent addition to the concise and relevant content of this book. If you own a small business or are thinking of staring one, you MUST get this one!"
4,An overlooked silly gem of a comedy,"I remember seeing this movie a long time ago and thinking it was funny. But I also know that Ellen's outing sort of overshadowed it. It was on last night and I watched it again. You do have to get past the knowledge of her sexual orientation but once you do let that go (come on people - its 2012 not 1912) I have to say I again found it a very funny movie. Her expressions are hysterical as all this craziness is going on around her. Bill Pullman is great. His transformation from sexy Mr. Right to this incredible whacko is the best. And there are some other great actors/actresses in this film. Joan Cusack as the vengeful ex-girlfriend should not be missed. Looking for a funny, light comedy? This is a good one."
3,Joan Cusack never disappoints,"This falls more along the lines of a black comedy which may or may not be your taste. I would say if you liked Death Becomes Her you will like this one. The humor is different but still enjoyable thanks to the good performances. Ellen has some funny moments but the scene stealer here is Joan Cusack as Inga, the crazy ex-girlfriend of the man she's currently dating. It was great seeing these two interact in the few scenes they have together. The Amazon review already lists the plot so I won't need to go into any details. Some of the dialogue is really silly but amusing. As long as you aren't expecting high art, this is worth it for some mindless laughs."
1,If you like to waste a time and money.,"Going to the movies is in general very fun thing for me and even if the film is not so very good, eating good pop corn and drinking coke is enough for me. But when I went to se this film all my body was irretated and couldnt be still in the seat. After the first half I should have listened to my heart and left the building but I had a little wish that the second half would save the evening. But it just got worse. It leaves a big ugly spot on Bill Pullman which I just loved in ""While you were sleeping"" and has done a good job in other films. Ellen dont quit your day-job(because your shows are fine). But Mr. Director were you in a hurry???"
3,A Fun Film,"I suspect more women will appreciate the film than men because there are shades of Mr. Wrong in situations that many of us have found ourselves in, so it is fun to laugh at the punched-up versions that happen to Martha (Ellen DeGeneres). This film is for you, if you can relax and enjoy inane comedy, but if you are looking for subtle, highbrow comedy, then this isn't for you. I would have liked to see more scenes with the antics of Wit (Bill Pullman), but hopefully a longer version will be released on DVD.Comedy is hard to do and Bill Pullman deserves extra credit for being able to laugh at, and along with, MAN-kind."
4,Fabulous Funny Movie!,"I adored this film. There are so many neurotic, obsessive men out there who can seem pretty wonderful when you first meet them -- so MANY women have had some of the experiences in this film! I thought it was hysterical. I howled with laughter. Yes, it's a little over-the-top, but aren't most great comedies?"
5,Compare to Nikon 5400. HA HA HA!!,"I had to write this to laugh at the guy that said the Nikon 5400 is better. Yeah it is, just don't plan on taking any pictures indoors, or in any poor light!! The POS Nikons don't have AF assist. If Nikon does not get on the ball, they will start losing market share to Casio.The G5 is a great camera. Funny how people say the S50 is better also, or any of the small P&S cameras. I have a little piece of info for ya'll, most are locked at 50 or 100 ISO, that's why there is so little noise.Keep your G5 locked at ISO 50, and it will blow them all away!!"
3,Look elsewhere,"I am huge Canon fan and have found the G5 disappointing -- Pros: Compact body, good battery, EOS dial features, up to 1GB memory, works with Speedlite EX flashes, good stop action photos, good menus, good electronics. Cons: The higher ASA does not work. Flash, particularly EX needed to shoot indoor photos, lots of grain, viewfinder gets the lens in the window! This camera needs a lot of lite to get a crisp image, indoors or out. Focus is soft. I had a digital elph S100 and found that to be better focus. Get an Elph or SLR but bypass the G5. This hybrid is lacking."
3,Sharp but with problems,"I ordered a G5 for work--we do a fair bit of digital imaging. We were very impressed with the resolution and sharpness of the images. I was reasonably pleased with the interface, though the other person who tried the camera thought the menus were too complex. HOWEVER .. this camera had very pronounced chromatic aberration showing at the boundary of light and dark areas in high-contrast situations. The dreaded ""purple fringing."" We had to send the camera back. It may be that this was an early lens or coating and this will be fixed in cameras produced later than the one we bought (December 2003). And it might not bother some users at all. But we thought it was unacceptable for a $600 camera. :-("
2,Niel young le noise blue day,Very very disappointing. Not at what we paid to see on cables pay preview. Not happy & not at all what we expected to get
2,Indifference to noise,"Reading previous commentary it looks like some folks are into their technology and don't get out much to have seen Neil and what his concerts are like live. Those wanting to hear some Good ol'fashioned Rock'N'Roll were very disappointed. I'll sit this one out. Neil is a talented man that has contributed to music in several genres. He is an advocate for people with disabilities with his Bridge Concerts so no apologies required. Maybe he had a few too many parties, is getting old like the rest of us, or his hearing is going. I still like his music. The old stuff is classic, but this will require a different ear than mine. PEACE"
1,Just Noise!,"I am a big fan of Neil Young, and have appreciated his music through all the twists and turns. Until now. I tried - really tried - to like this CD. But, it is just a lot of noise - it is aptly titled."
5,sean callery and jack bauer rock!!,I just got this the other day. Callery's music in 24 is epic!! Cant wait to hear sean callerys music in a movie theather with jack bauer on the big screen:) My favorite track is Mandy's plan/jack storms the gas plant.
3,"Good, but not thrilling","I think Sean Callery's an excellent composer, but I agree with most of the previous reviewers. This disc simply isn't as good as the previous one. The selections aren't as exciting and I don't think music from the game should have been included. The 24 Theme as played here is from the game and sounds bland -- it just doesn't ""pop."" The cover states ""Seasons Four and Five"" and they should've stuck to that. I'm glad I bought the disc, but it definitely comes in second when compared to the first CD."
4,Best Book Available on Carmel Cottages,"I am an architect. I live near Carmel and have a special fascination for these houses. Applause to the author. There are lots of beautiful photographs and the history is facinating. I would always like to see more diagrams, interesting details and floor plans, especially for the house called ""Hansel"". However, this is an excellent book, the best one available on the subject."
5,Beautiful photos,"If you're into Carmel like I am, you'll love this book, perfect to browse through when you get sentimental and miss Carmel and it's beauty... I keep it at my coffee table, so guests who've never been there can look, ooh and ahh, and daydream of what it might be like to go there. Nice and thoughoh, <--sp? but yeah, it's a great, great book, definately buy, if anything just for the pretty pix."
2,okayyy,"So where the heck is my spirit guide? Ive met more spirit guides in my dreams without using anything! For me this product did nothing!! It was just soothing! Didnt meet a spirit guide, didnt ""see"" anything! Used it every night for a month and nothing!"
3,Sting,"If you watched the movie Sting,this book is about the same. It is written almost ready to be made into a movie and it will be releases this summer. You should be able to speed read through it within a few hours and if you stop long enough at the sugar pills con, you could have almost guess the ending."
5,Best Deal,"This box set is the best deal for just $20, which includes both Garfield Gets Real and Garfields Fun Fest! Garfield Get Real features Garfield in a full CGI animated film with amazing detail. Its also packed with seven bonus featurettes and two DVD-ROM Games."
3,"Excellent Material, questionable sequence","I've always taken issue with this collection; I find its lack of coherence stunning, and that's why it's docked two stars; this is not the fault of the long-deceased artist.I find it kind of startling to hear Hathaway's early tracks side by side with ""Back Together Again,"" a mediocre 1978 disco romp with Roberta Flack. Eight minutes later, you're listening to ""Someday We'll All Be Free"". This comp should have at least been put in chronological order. That would have lended a little continuity to the record.Standout tracks include Al Kooper's ""I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know,"" rarity ""This Christmas"", Gaye's ""What's Going On"" and his 1971 burner ""The Ghetto""."
5,I got more than I wanted !!!,"I purchased this CD for one song only(The Ghetto) This song has part I & II as one continious play. I listened to this CD then realized other hit like ""Back together again"" Closer I get to you"" both with Roberta Flack. I was about to order her CD but I found what I was looking for all on this CD. Go ahead and buy this ! I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I have."
2,His fist cd's are Horrible,lots of mas screaming without direction and a lot of non sense . 92 - 95 . Then you get to the late 90's and 00's and is classic Reggae . I guess he had to start somewhere . It just seems to be 2 diffrent people . Weird . Dont like it .
4,BUJU IS COOL,"look, whoever says that Buju Banton is a disgrace to reggae they got something wrong with them. okay, maybe he's not the best, but he is pretty damn good and has a totally individual vocal style. i am a rasta (at least i try) and i have a reggae band and i know that he is good. personally i like the songs 'murderer' and 'untold stories' and 'Buju movin'. they have a good feel to them"
4,From one of the masters of the short story,"Terrific collection from one of the masters of the short story and a personal favorite. Stand out stories include:The Head Hunter - a tale of madness concerning an executioner in BerlinThe Weird Tailor - a tailor undertakes an unusual commission that proves tragicThe Pin - unbelievable power and responsibility is contained within a silver pin and woe to the person who welds itThe Cure - in Brazil, a thief learns firsthand the horror of what happens when something is lost in translationTalent - Andrew Benson had talent; he could imitate anybody or anythingA Case of the Stubborns - it takes a visit to the Conjure Lady to convince Grandpa that he's deadNina - Nolan learns the folly of fornicating with one of the Snake peopleHighly recommended."
5,Upset over 'lost' return!!!,"Very upset! I accidently ordered two of the same pairs of shoes for my husband's Christmas present. Once I realized my double order; I tried to delete one. Amazon told me it was too late and shoe company assured me 1 WAS cancelled. I received both pairs, immediately called Amazon who printed a new label for return. Return prepared and to Staples for pickup by UPS. Returns had experienced no problems in past. Well either Staples, UPS or Shoebuy/Amazon lost my package and each blamed the other. I had a receipt showing it was dropped at Staples to be sent UPS, but no package to prove it. I am thoroughly upset at everyone involved because SOMEONE screwed up and I am left holding the bag for over $90! I am disabled and needed that money DESPERATELY!!! You are losing an excellent customer because I cannot afford for the same thing to happen again! Since it was an Amazon.com purchase the least you can offer is a store credit for the amount that I spent. Thank you."
4,Great Book,"This is a Great Book, and one that should be read... It is a story about Buffalo Bill and his adventures, and his Great-Grandson William Cody. Its the Best book i have read in a long time... SO READ IT!!"
5,Perfect updated baptism outfit,This outfit was perfect for our son's baptism. It was in November so the sweater material was perfect for a cold church. The look is also updated which is nice as my husband and I didn't want him in one of those white polyester suits or a gown. The hat was too big for the 0-3 size and definitely will not fit home for several more months. The tadpole logo is on a tag on the hat and the outfit. Only call that out because it looks like a sperm which was a bit strange.
1,"Hate the seat, doesn't deserve the Britax name.",The base is open bottom so it is hard on leather seats. The lock off clip has borken twice and had to be replaced. The cover (stars and stripes/american flag) faded terribly after first wash in cold water. I've had a Big Cat Roundabout for 5 years and still madly love it. I just got a Big Cat Roadster to replace this and will be selling the marathon on a popular auction site.
5,Great product.,These worked great on a 22.5 lb turkey. Glad I purchased them. Will also come in handy while using the smoker.
5,Marc Cohn sings the Blues,"The first album Marc Cohn produced is just awesome. I think everyone knows his hit, ""Walking in Memphis"", but the rest of this album is great. The music is sometimes raw, and the arrangments are very imaginative. I definitely recommend this album to anyone who fell in love with ""Walking in Memphis"". I just wish I heard more of his music on the radio. He's very underrated."
4,More music the pop world just passes by,"Marc Cohn, not too unlike Edwin McCain or Jefferey Gaines, provides the world with listening pleasures that are sophisticated, deep, catchy, touching, and relevant. Though 'pop' radio might not appreciate Marc's music in the ways it should, the fans sure do. Why only 4 stars? So if Marc Cohn ever reads this he'll keep striving to push the talent envelope and I'll have more of his fantastic CD's to listen to! If I give him 5 he may slack off a bit and we can't have that!"
5,Brilliant!,"This is a must listen album by Marc Cohn. His great voice accompanies brilliant musical arrangements on the album. The most famous song on the disc, ""Walking In Memphis"" got (and continues to get) plenty of airplay in Australia but there is much more to this album. I love playing this album late at night when songs like ""True Companion"" and ""Dig Down Deep"" sound so right."
4,Walking in Memphis,"I like this CD, especially ""Walking in Memphis"" and ""Silver Thunderbird"". Well done.Slower tempo than modern rock but not really blues. Very good."
4,A Must-Have if you don't own the original albums,If you are a new Zep fan and don't have the regular albums than this would be a great thing to get. But if you already own all those then this isn't a smart investment due to it's price tag and lack of new stuff besides travelling riverside blues which is on bbc sessions anyways.
5,In Heaven,I was in heaven...I fell in love with Led Zeppelin again. This is one of the best compilations I've ever heard. Led Zep has never sounded so good.
5,A truly great compilation from one of rock's legends!,"I love everything about this collection from the song selection (though I wish 'How Many More Times' and 'Tea For One' were included) to the liner notes. I especially like the arrangement of the selections; it gives you a feel for how the band evolved. Led Zeppelin is truly more than the sum of its parts; they almost defy categorization. To call them a rock band, or a heavy metal band is to over-simplify things. They were true innovators! What the Beatles and the Stones and other rock pioneers started, Led Zeppelin took to its logical conclusion. As the saying goes: ""Often immitated, but NEVER duplicated."""
1,Feh,"A bunch of boring blues rip-offs and boring songs about Vikings. It all sounds identical.Nice cover art, as the bands' fans are likely the type into that crop circle twaddle."
2,silly muzak included,"I felt cheated when I listened to it first, as it has a weird dim muzak tune all through the tape, though it is supposed to be 'NON-ENHANCED WITH MUSIC VERSION'. It sounds as though you were sitting in a foyer of an el-cheapo hotel located somewhere in a sea side resort. OK, it has a certain charm, after all this sort of tape is meant to 'relax' you and if there were no background tune, may be it would sound too dull with just squeaky noise of ropes and screws etc of a sailboat and sounds of seagulls. The tapping sound of the water is a bit too monotonous."
1,100% pure... not even!,This product contians LYE... so much for the benifits of olive oil. It leaves your skin feeling dry and itchy.Now I remember why I stopped buying things on the internet.
4,One of the best songwriters around,"I just came across the only review for this album giving it one star. A travesty. Boo Hewerdine has consistently written great songs for years - and Thanksgiving has lots of those. Particular favourites are ""Lazy Heart"" and ""Footsteps Fall"". Great backing vocals from Martha Wainwright, daughter of Loudon, and all produced by John Wood, the man behind Nick Drake's ""Pink Moon"", currently getting exposure in the Amazon.Com charts because of the VW Cabrio ad."
2,not worth it,I thought this would be fun for my son to play with his dad in the yard. It wouldnt fly well and it broke after like 2 throws! Besides the fact that it is an airplane (which makes him like it) this toy is awful.
4,Ron Burgundy,"What can I say? He is ""Ron Burgundy""...If you enjoy Will Ferrel, you will love this movie. There is classic Ferrel comedy throughout the whole thing."
2,"Sort of funny, but not really","There were some laughs in this movie, however they all involved something not involving Will Farrell. Jack Black was funny. Steve Carrell was funny. All the cameos were funny. That bald dude with the moustache from Out Cold was funny. Will Farrell was not funny. He is never funny and needs to go away."
1,"""Will"" not be buying it!!!","I saw this movie in the theatre and it was a waste of money. I'm usually a big fan of Will Ferrell, but this movie was very weak for the most part. There were some funny parts, like when Ron Burgundy was talking to his dog (as another reviewer said) but that was about it. It's been a while since I saw this movie in the theatre, so I can't remember a lot of specifics. I do remember being annoyed and bored throughout a good portion of the movie. One part that just topped on the annoyance scale, were the appearances of Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson. It was like the cast of Old School reunited (another movie I was not thrilled with). These actors need to expand their horizons and try working with different people. If anyone is looking for a good Will Ferrell movie, go with A Night At the Roxbury."
1,Makes Pauly Shore movies look like Oscar winners,"This movie so bad. Will Ferrell should have stayed on SNL. His decision to leave SNL to do movies was as wise as Shelley Long leaving Cheers to do movies.'Anchorman' is almost totally void of any enertainment value for anyone with an IQ above 10. It is a bad, worthless and inane movie. I had to give it one star because Amazon does not allow zero or negative stars.The movie has three very brief redeeming bits... the Indian food in a diaper comment, Christina Applegate in an apron, and the Avengers theme during a fight. That is it.Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson should fire their agents or leave Hollywood for good. Until they learn how to pick a good movie, I will not see anymore movies with either of those three idiots.For your own sake, do not waste any money by renting or buying this amazingly bad movie. Look for this movie to sweep The Razzies."
5,Definitely worth it!!,"Great price, easy to order... Movie arrived in no time, sealed as if I had bought it at the store. Will Ferrell never disappoints :)"
3,Stupid Human Tricks vs Stupid Pet Tricks,"If you have a choice between watching stupid pet tricks and stupid human tricks - Anchorman. Take the pets for they know not what they do. Stupid humans know what they do and still do it anyway. However, one has to agree certain network Anchor ""persons"" come to mind while watching this film..which upon further consideration is more of a documentary then Moore's ""F 9-11""! Oh..just go see it and decide for yourself!"
1,Shame on you Will!,"I like Will Ferrell, I thought he was hilarious in Elf, but this was horrible! Very rarely will I turn off a movie before it is finished, but this one left me little choice. It just wasn't funny at all! It's filled with trashy ""comedy"" that only an annoying sleeze ball would laugh at. Save your money on this one!"
4,When in Rome..,"If you like silly comedy than this movie is for you.The lines in the movie are classic and everyone in the film is hilarious.Ron Burgundy falls in love with and has to battle with Christina Applegate. Not only does he have to worry about his love life, but he also has to worry about his dog who speaks spanish and the hatred he faces from the other news teams (Hilarious scene featuring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, and Tim Robbins)I gave the fim 4 stars. I know I can watch it whenever I feel like just laughing.Who knew that Paul Rudd was so funny?"
3,Anchorman dvd,"Everyone told me how great this was. It was in my opinion good, but not great for Will Ferrell. They are making #2 now because so many people love this movie. I don't dislike it I'm just a little disappointed in Will. I seem the only one though."
4,Pretty darn funny,"This movie was a riot. I laughed the whole time. Will Farrel and the rest of the cast were hilarious. While many of the jokes were stupid funny thats pretty much the whole point of the movie. It funny. No matter what any one else says the movie is just really funny. Its not supposed to be moving or anything else its just supposed to be funny. Laugh, don't critisize it. Watch it. Definatly watch it."
4,"""Oh, I'm in a glass case of emotion!""","This is one of the most hilarious comedies from Will Ferrel and Steve Carell. I don't care if it looks dumb or it's not very smart, all I care about is that this film definintely makes me laugh. Carell steals the show as the mildly retarded Brick (""Fantastic!""), while Ferrel and Applegate make an interesting onscreen duo. And let's not forget some unexpected cameos in the middle of the film.Watch it, and you'll be in hysterics. And don't forget: always drink your scotty scotch scotch!"
3,Actually More Funny Than Not Funny,"I caught this one on HBO over the weekend and I laughed hard at least a dozen times, which is exactly about a dozen more times than I thought I would. Will Ferrell is getting a little annoying to me the more I see him in films (loved him on SNL), but he gave me a few chuckles in this one. I loved all the cameos and some of the dirty humor, but this is one you won't want to see more than once or twice."
4,Knights of Columbus,"This movie was great, it was weird, but very funny! A must for Will Ferrell fans. A+++"
2,A really over the top spoof of local news coverage.,"It does give you the idea, that network news picks the best & leaves the chimps to do local news & cover irrelevant & banal features. The gags are geared to a six-year old. Too obvious for an adult. It reminds me of Late Night with David Letterman. He has a brain-fart & it falls falt. He thinks it will become funny if he repeats it three or four times, then explains the joke. No. Only his fool, Paul Schaefer laughs. Anchorman gives you escapist fare & you'll find yourself predicting what will happen next. Will Farrell sharpened his acting skills since then, but not much. The gang fight with all the local news teams is the funniest scene. That's about it."
3,Great concepts... poor execution,"Mildly amusing and generally inoffensive; Will Ferrell pulls off being a likable boor, and his co-stars are adequate. But the setups are much funnier than the bits themselves; there were a lot of those ""boy, this is gonna be funny.... ummm, well, kind of..."" A lot like an SNL sketch; funny premise, disappointing execution. Some potentially great cameos suffer the same fate; there are several well-known faces given almost nothing amusing to say or do. One telling sign of its mediocrity: you walk away remembering no killer lines that bring to mind killer scenes. Okay, I'll give them one: during anchor Ron Burgundy's struggle for newsroom supremacy, his signature sign-off is sabotaged on his teleprompter, and what results is pretty funny. That's one. Maybe I'm just not Ferrell's demographic; to paraphrase the late great Dr. Frank-n-furter, ""I didn't make it for you!"" C+"
1,Horrible,I suggest not even renting this one...such a disappointment.All I can say is this is a bad bad movie!!!!
2,Ummm???,"Couldn't wait for it to be over. Didn't think it was particularly funny, thought it was kind of stupid."
5,heart thumping quidam,"This is a true cross between the circus and broaway. It has so much passion, laughter and life relationships, that anyone can and should relate to it. It is a MUST SEE for anyone who is a fan of the theater."
3,not as good as the PPV,"I saw this performance on pay-per-view and absolutely fell in love! I had never seen a Cirque performance before and was totaly mesmerized. Buying this for my father-in-law, I expected the same amazing show. Unfortunately, the video rendition suffers from terribly distracting camera work and the best acts are cut very short. However, for one who has never seen a Cirque performance it is still worth watching. I can only hope their future videos are more representative of their live shows."
1,Big Dissapointment,"After seeing Mystere, Vareka and Dralion I was truly dissapointed in the performance of Quidam.Artistically the music, the theme was dark and gloomy and it lacked tremendously the pizzazz of the other shows.The performance were nothing spectacular and I was little baffled from the wonderful reviews it received from the others.I am not saying this was the worst show I have ever seen but compared to the others it truly was a disappointment.I would highly recommend to check the other three before you venture into Quidam."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"I bought this foodmill to crush whole canned tomatoes, but there doesn't seem to be enough pressure pushing the blade down, so you have to turn the handle much longer than this job should take. I need to ask my sister what kind she has as hers crushes tomatoes in just a few seconds."
4,Creative and Disciplined Living,"At first I thought this would be a book on simple cost-saving approaches to living, but it soon turned complicated. From grinding your own flour for bread, to growing your own vegetables and canning. Wood-burning stove for heat and cooking only from scratch. The author does warn the reader to take it slowly and not attempt to try it all at once. I do like her ideas regarding creative gifts and organization. Very helpful. Overall, entertaining reading, though the ideals are a bit frightening for the average reader."
5,Good values,This is a must for every parent (father and son relationship)...it will penetrate your hardened heart and understand the feeling of a long lost individual...I was in tears when both the fathers and sons reconnected and reunited...its really a happy ending...thanks Amazon for the free and fast shipping.
3,Pretty but HIGH,"Love these shoes, bought 2 pair, and they are comfortable but they're just too high a heel for me. I teeter and can only take tiny steps. Still gorgeous shoes for those who know how to walk the walk."
4,Truckin BC,"""B.C. Truckin On Down"" is a collection of Johnny Hart's B.C. dailies from 1970-1971, first published by Fawcett in 1975. It's a fairly funny set of strips, featuring various gags from the folk of B.C. My favorite would have to be the ""water balls"" that one caveman makes with his hands and takes from the river like snowballs. Someone tries to scare him to drop them, but they don't break, they only get dirty. Silly."
2,Is It just Me?,"I was personally shocked when I saw the reviews for this book. I didn't expect to see such high ratings, I expected to see negative opinions on the book. So maybe it's just me and the book was pretty good, but in my opinion, I thought the book was not worth reading."
5,Taught tale well told,"MP is Name of the Rose writ small -- less verbose and learned perhaps, but equally vivid and authentic. It is a story of intricate turnings and great suspense. Through it all, Unsworth evokes the world of 14th century Britain in spare yet precise detail. He is a tremendously imaginative writer. MP richly rewarded my few hours' investment. I loved this novel."
1,Big Disappointment,"There is no story line or plot, as there usually is in Saura's other movies that involve dancing; dancers and singers in a flamenco studio just perform. There is way too much singing (and close-ups of people singing) of the painful, wailing and grimacing type and not enough joyful song. And there is not enough dancing!! What little dancing there is is a bit cool and a touch modern, as are the stark sets. I like authentic flamenco (I have seen wonderful performances by well-known dancers) and I usually like Carlos Saura, but the dancing in this movie is somewhat pretentious and unengaging. I fast-forwarded through most of the DVD. CVA"
1,Poor work !,"This is a very dissapointing video. If you're expecting to see a long Joaquin Cortes performance, forget it!. He only appears for 1 or 2 minutes. Also, if you enjoy ""baile"" Flamenco this is not for you, there's too much ""cante"". Poor quality in general. This video is overpriced (...)"
4,Different movie,"I watched this movie and I liked it. This is a different horror movie, which can be funny too. The drama, and plot is something that in my opinion is out of the box. You have to see it, so you would understand my point of view.*Sponsored Post"
1,Wherify out of business?,"My son received a Wherifone from his grandparents. However, when we called to activate the phone all of the company's phone lines listed in the package literature and on their web site were not in service or disconnected.Sounds to me like they have gone belly up. We were very disappointed as we never even got a chance to use the device."
4,Deconstruction,"Libeskind has refind his deconstructivist style, expressionist architecture and somewhat of an ""acquired"" taste. The book shows only a couple of pictures per project, however the reading gives a fantastic insight into the mind of Libeskind. I'm not the type that would usually read the amount of text that's included in this book but it does draw you in, enabling a full and ""accurate"" understanding of what his architecture is all about. If your not passionate about deconstructivist architecture steer well clear."
1,A Well Designed Ego,"It's very unfortunate that you cannot give a book zero stars or, better yet, minus 5 stars. The only interesting design that Daniel Libeskind has ever come up with is his own ego. That is truly a work of art! The book is a hollow attempt to be clever, the way a teenager (or adolescent) who thinks he knows it all would try to be clever. I was actually embarrassed for him after reading it. Now, tell me again, how did someone of such little consequnce and talent ""win"" the the LMDC competition to redesign Ground Zero?"
1,Suspicious circumstances,"I do not understand why certain critics who are acquaintances of Mr. Lambert's have described this as an affectionate book about actress Natalie Wood. It is not a sympathetic portrait of Miss Wood' in fact, Mr. Lambert blames her for the tragic events in her life when she's not alive to defend herself. He also goes out of his way to attack her mother and her sister in what seems to be a personal vendetta while at the same time falsely glorifying rv actor Robert Wagner, who he admits is a long time friend of his. There would be no need to remember Miss Wood in a book at this time had she not drowned under suspicious circumstances that Mr. Wagner obviously wishes to conceal. It is clear that Mr. Lambert's true loyalty is to Robert Wagner, not to Natalie Wood."
2,Yawn...,"I've been struggling to finish this book for over 3 months. A book of this length would typically take me a week to finish. This book, however, seems painfully endless. This was my first adventure into the world of biographies. I warn others who may choose this book as their first biography, STOP, put the book down and look for some other biography. However, if you want boring account of Natalie Wood's script selection, give Lambert's book a try, at the very least you can use it to treat insomnia. Lambert has done a grave injustice to such a fascinating Hollywood icon."
4,Would buy again,"Very good product...not greasy. Compared to similar products, I would buy this one over any other. Slightly expensive however, good."
4,Where was this on the AFI 100?,"Fun, entertaining, contrived, stupid, maudlin, inane, ersatz, assine, whatever. Wild Things is at one point or another can be described as such. With my back to the wall I could only say that Wild Things is pure Cheese and YES I liked it. Plot twists, sexual tension, and comedic absurdity combine together in a mixture of insanity.As a DVD release it is not bad. The commentary is not terribly informative, but again coming from the guys that made this movie it is fun. Deleted scenes, don't bother. From there its the standard fare, trailers et cetera."
3,edgy with unexpected plot twists but rather juvenile,All of the characters were too obvious and base for this to really be a great film. But what do you expect from a film marketed to teens? Shakespeare. I don't think so. And that's not to take anything away from the numerous rather surprising plot twists. But the film just never quite gets it.I personally would have liked to seen more of Theresa Russell. Now that's a real woman and not a little girl like the two other primary actresses.It's worth a rental when you've got nothin' else to do just don't expect too much.
4,"A cool movie, twisted and sexy plot, great cast","A sexy movie churned up in a twisted plot, Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, Matt Dillion, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Murray make this a very worthwhile film to see. Guys will probably oogle over the threesome scene with Denise, Neve and Matt, and it's a really nice scene :-) The acting is very good, and the cast played their parts well. I knocked off a star because I didn't need to see Kevin's sausage. That could have stayed in the towel. (All I can say is, fast forward through the shower scene!) Great movie to see, and its worth buying it!"
5,It was great thiller that kept you guessing.,i think it was a great film the sex is not to bad in the movie.Kevin Bacon was great in the film.I am looking foward for more thillers like this one.It has a lot of twists in the movie which makes it a good thiller.This movie kept you on your feet the whole time.I just bought the film and I am going to which it many times.I am stund that Kevin Bacon produce the movie.He did a very good job.this thiller keeps you on your feet a lot longer than these other thillers like 8mm and Basic Instinct.
2,:-(,I dont see difference from the previous edition. Are there hidden features or tracks I missed? Hope anyone can help me here.
3,Not bad...,"I thought it was pretty good. I wish Neve and Denise got it on a lot more and a little more hard core.. ya know.. But anyway, the movie had a good plot and kept me guessing. It sort of reminded me of a Melros Place type thing and bill was pretty funny too. Over all a great movie and I would recomend picking it up."
5,new world karma,"I am not a music expert, but I've heard similar music under the New Age or New World category. If it is part of it, I have to say this group has a very spiritual and flowing feeling. Great combination of soft trance with vocalized sounds. I love this CD and Nuages de Monde-incredible type of music I haven't been exposed to yet and I love its mysterious feeling!"
5,Delerium - Karma CD,This is one of my all time favourite albums of all times. It's just absolutely beautiful. The voices of her and the guest artists and the depth and layers transports you. If you don't own this album you should no doubt.
2,Danze Shower Head not true Oil Rubbed Bronze,We purchased this item to go with other items from Danze that would make a complete tub transformation to Oil Rubbed Bronze only to find that this item and the shower arm are not a true Oil Rubbed Bronze. They look more like a oil rubbed gold color. We decided to not use them and they now sit in our basement. The image is deceiving. Not happy with the purchase.
5,Sabbath's Best Album Since Mob Rules; Buy It Now!,"Plug this one in, and be blown away as you wonder where an hour went. This one kicks you in the face right off the bat with ""I Witness"" and from that point on tracks range from evil (""Virtual Death"", ""Evil Eye"" which was co-written by Eddie Van Halen) to beautiful (""Dying for Love"", ""Cross of Thorns"") to fast and furious (""Psychophobia"") to a mixture of all of the above (""Cardinal Sin"", ""Immaculate Deception""). There are some who will scream, ""this isn't the real Black Sabbath,"" but put that aside and just listen to the album; it's a GREAT album, whether you call it Iommi-Butler-Martin Band or Black Sabbath or Five Guys In A Band. _Dehumanizer_ was good (as were _Tyr_, _Headless Cross_, and _Eternal Idol_), but _Cross Purposes_ is better. Do yourself a favour and buy it now."
3,Adequate but nothing special,"This was not as good as other similar recordings I have heard, but sufficient to put you to sleep. No music or bird noises. Extremely repetitive, without much of the variation of the real ocean. The price was certainly right, however!"
2,This is NOT going to help anyone lose weight,"This also is not for someone looking for a challenging workout, or for someone who is not woo-woo. I was looking for something to really make me sweat and feel the burn. This video has you doing foot circles and the like.Also, I just can't get past her telling me to breathe out of my feet. I am sorry, but anatomically your only two options are your nose and your mouth, unless you have a sucking chest wound. Feet are just not an option for exhaling. However, if you are the kind of person who likes this sort of visualization, well, you just might like this tape."
3,Not as challenging as I thought it would be,"I am a Pilates beginner and this workout was not as challenging as I thought it would be. After reading the reviews on this video, I thought it would consist of a more vigorous routine. (Note: I follow mainly the level 3 (some level 2) exercises throughout the video.) I purchased this video along with the suggested bundle video - ""Zone - Pilates Mat Workout"", and I find this routine more of a workout than the ""Weight Loss"" video. ""Pilates for Weigh Loss"" is a nice video and there a couple of moments that are somewhat tough, but I use this video (of the 3 Pilates videos I have) when I want more relaxation than workout."
3,Somewhat disappointing,I purchased this DVD assuming it would be a step further in difficulty from Ana Caban's Intermediate mat workout. I was disappointed. This workout is too easy and too slow. I don't have time to do such a long boring slow workout. I would recommend something else if weight loss is your goal.
2,Mixed Feelings on this one.,"I really enjoyed the 10 minute segment on getting centred and learning the correct breath and form techniques. It has helped me tremendously in all other pilates videos, where this has been overlooked. However i find the excersize portion is very slow moving and uninteresting in presentation. If I had not done pilates earlier, and this was the first tape i tried I would not go back to it. But having done pilates and enjoying it, i understood some of the moves, and I find this particular work out to be especially comforting after a very stresfull day. But its not my workout of choice."
4,Okay if you are looking for a relaxing workout,"The first 10 minutes of this video are spent talking about body, mind and spirit and how we have to have balance between them to lose weight and get in shape. It also touches on breathing techniques, which are easy to figure out. I usually skip this part, but I do the warmups, which are kind of fun. The exercises are for the most part, not very challenging, but it is still a good workout if you focus on quality of movement rather than quantity.As far as the weight loss goes, it's not going to happen unless you cut calories as well. I am still waiting to see if I can lose inches without losing pounds!"
2,Moves at a snail's pace,"This video was utterly dull and boring. It moves way too slow. I've been working out for over 15 years and consider myself to be pretty advanced in most areas of exercise. I loaned this tape to a friend who has NEVER tried pilates and even she turned it off after only 5 minutes. If you're looking for a good intro to pilates, go for Pilates for Dummies. It's a basic, no nonsense approach and you'll definitely see results."
3,Disappointed,"I am somewhat disappointed in this DVD. I take a Pilates class and this program doesn't do many of the exercises my instructor does. She also doesn't explain what the exercises are for as well as not reminding you to breathe. She does say inhale-exhale, but I need someone to just say ""breathe"". I think this would be a good beginning workout for someone who hasn't taken a class. She does the same exercises for each level and just modifies the positions to make them harder as you get stronger. While this aspect is good, it can also be boring after a few times. I would have liked to have more workouts available for the price I paid."
5,Great workout for beginners,This pilates video is great. It has three different levels of difficulty and two different lengths for each level so you can start slow and build up.The moves seems easy but if done correctly they can really challenge you and create smooth muscles. I recommend this to pilates beginners and people with joint problems. It works!
2,Not what you expect,"The title is deciving at best. This was my first experience with pilates and expected it to be more of a workout. I've done the vidoe about 5 times and am already bored. It is very slow and long. None the less, its a very nice way to end your day, especially the hammock at the end. This is more of a relax tape then a workout and is great to get you ready for bed!"
2,Disappointing,"After really enjoying increased flexibility plus a great workout from ""The Method Pilates - All in One Workout"" and ""Denise Austin - Pilates For Every Body"", I was *sure* that I would enjoy rotating them with this new one while also burning enough calories to encourage weight loss. But this DVD is so low-key I barely ever put use it anymore. After purchasing this, I bought ""A.M. And P.M. Pilates Mat Workouts"" and that one is fantastic for those mornings where I'm tired or short on time, and at night I make up for it with the more intense P.M. workout.So... it sounds as though people wanting purist Pilates will find this DVD welcome. But for those wanting ""Conditioning for Weight Loss""... it didn't live up to that claim in my opinion."
3,Probably not for Weight Loss,"I thought that this would be a more challenging video (and I bought it when I was 3 weeks post partum). It most likely will not bring about any weight loss with out dieting. I would have enjoyed it more if it had fewer gaps between each exercise. It seems as if each explaination lasts nearly as long as the individual exercise. If you are brand new to Pilates and are just starting out on an exercise program, this may be the video for you, but if you have been working out for any length of time prior to this, it probably will not be challenging enough."
1,Slow and boring... and won't do anything for weight loss.,"I did this tape once before I'd ever taken a pilates class. I found it slow, boring, and confusing. After I took a few pilates classes I returned to it to see if perhaps I'd like it better. I had to shut it off at the 40 minute mark because I was bored and unchallenged. Other than a few key moves (such as The Hundred) you could pretty much throw this tape out the window. I can't see how this tape will help you loose weight."
3,Collection of specific cases,"This book explores many cases of self similar structures that give rise to fractals .It is not mathematically oriented and the few mathematical arguments are easy .It is full of examples of anecdotical character demonstrating power laws and self similarity (concert halls , music , image treatment etc) .There are also some nice pictures .However it is not by any account a book concerning the chaos theory .As a physicist I have been disappointed .It is too long to be a book on fractal esthetics and it is too short and too anecdotical to be a book about non linear dynamics .The only description I can find would be : entertaining mathematical games on the concept of iteration and self similarity ."
2,Gottcha,"Carolyn should have had a clear indication of Richard's character when he was attacked by the neighbors dog. I did not find this book suspensefull, but very repetitious, it took a long time for Carolyn to catch on to anyhing.It seemed to get all neatly tied up in the last couple pages, but there were a few holes in all that the perp managed to accomplish in his reign of terror.Mediocre to be kind."
3,"not the greatest, 21/2stars","This was an okay book. I knew who the villian was as soon as the person was introduced. It was a good filler book, when there is nothing else you have to read. But it was a little boring, not much action. The Flower Man is by far Donna Anders best book. So don't judge her based on this book alone."
3,Fast Read. Pretty Predictable.,I read this book within a few hours. It was an extremely fast read and also a very predictable ending. I wouldn't say it was suspenseful...just a fast read.
5,I'M IN LOVE!!,I love love loooove these shoes! I just received the leopard print today! I tried them on at work and got so many compliments! I want to wear them with my colored jeans and shorts to give my out fits a little kick! I am usually a 8.5 in sandals however I read reviews on other websites and decided to order a 9. They fit perfect!!!
3,"Poor sound quality, but totally worth having.","This was the fourth PxDx album I bought, after 'Terrifyer', 'Prowler in the Yard', and 'Phantom Limb'. As I stated in the review title, the quality of the recordings isn't quite what I expected, even from grindcore, but I like the album anyway. The covers are pretty good and all in all the album is not bad. If you're into Pig Destroyer, get this record."
4,Good deal for the $,"This is actually a set of wax carving tools. However, they do exactly what I wanted them to, which is to clean mineral specimens. Shipping was amazingly fast and I'm happy with the product."
4,wax carving tools/dental tools,"the twelve piece set i recieved is pretty good. aside from some very minor burrs on a few tools, there is nothing bad to say. the set is really versatile in working on wax to make bronze art. or if used on modeling clay or plastalina they come in very handy."
5,Loved this book,"I really loved this book. It gave me great understanding about the Holy Spirit, which changed my prayers and life. I am so glad I read this book. There is a few chapters in the book that talks about The Gifts of the Spirit. I didn't enjoy those chapters as much, mostly because I already kinda knew that information...but, I just loved the rest of the book."
5,Good Value for the Money!,"Unless you are an audiophile, I'm sure that you will be quite pleased with this receiver! I know I am!"
3,Good Sound but Gets HOT,"This receiver sounds good, but I found that it gets really hot after a couple of hours of use. I had to put a new shelf in my entertainment center rack so I wouldn't have to put any other components on top of the receiver. There is no fan to circulate the air in the receiver. Other than that (and HDMI pass through only) it has good sound and good features. The remote leaves much to be desired, but at this price who can complain too much."
1,Beware before buying Audio equipment from Amazon!!!,"Reconsider buying a audio product from Amazon!!!! Amazon will take returns for 30 days, if something goes wrong after 30 days, you must deal with the Manufacturer. The Onkyo TX-SR505 that I bought broke down after six weeks, I only used it five or six times. I contacted Onkyo, the only way to repair the unit is to send it to a service center. In order to send a receiver to the service center, the cost is $75! I recommend buying from your local Best Buy or Circuit City or other retailer. I would also recommend spending a few more dollars and get a better receiver. I love Amazon, but not for Audio equipment!!!!!"
4,Good Purchase,product was in excellent condition and was shipped promptly. Arrived without any problems and seems to work great so far.
5,great sound system for a great price,"i recently purchased this unit after buying two other, more expensive and more complicated systems.i first bought the Sony str-dg810 6.1 channel receiver, and much to my dismay it was an awful receiver. i returned it for the Harmon Kardon avr-147 and while it was an upgrade, it still lacked the sound quality. i finally ended up purchasing this receiver and i was pleasently surprised. for the price, you get a good receiver with good sound quality, and a decent picture. if you are looking for top end, than this isn't for you. however, if you don't want to shell out a grand, i would buy this before buying the other ""made in china"" receivers!!"
4,A Must for Brokers or Buyers,"As a Yacht Broker I bought all three volumes and find they are the best consolidated data on production and some one off sailboats. They cover 270 manufacturers and 1150 boats. It was a monumental task to compile this data and I would like to see it changed to a better format. The books are 5.5"" X 8.5"" and therefore some of the layouts are difficult to read. I found the mechanical data rather skimpy, ie. engines, gensets, steering. The printings were 1991,1994 & 1998. I would like to see everything on a CD-ROM so it could be run through a photo software program, printed out, and E-mailed."
1,My Pitch against this book.,"Many sports fans end up basing their world so completely around their chosen sport that it ends up eclipsing everything else in their lives. Everything and everyone in their life suffers and the sport becomes a addiction. Nick Hornby is addicted to football and describes this humorously through showing his remarkable memory for facts and witty recollections of many moments gone foggy in the minds of other soccer fans. Unfortunately its just not very interesting after fifty pages, to hear of the authors anguish over Arsenal crashing out of the Rumbelows cup in the second round, again. His writing has about as much descriptive power as that of the New York Post or Boston Herald and our sympathies for his character and the other walk-on parts in his obsessed life barely register. Not litreature, not clever not for everyone."
2,Not for non-soccer-fans,"I bought this book hoping it would be an undiscovered gem by the writer who gave us About A Boy and High Fidelity. I am a late-middle-aged American with no particular interest in British football. The book is, at heart, an autobiography of Mr. Hornby as an obsessive football (soccer) fan growing up in the London area, and, in terms of word count, the emphasis is decidedly on ""football"" over ""autobiography"".While there were nuggets of self-revelation, there was much more of cavilling over the performance minutiae of players in whom I have no interest. And not football players in general, but-primarily- players for Arsenal, which I presume to be based in or near London. Who cares? I was much more intrigued by Among the Thugs, which at least had some visceral violence."
4,Great insight to the Football fanatic's mind,"Being an American, I've always enjoyed English football, but once I visited and realized the extent of the obsession with the game we call soccer, it absolutely floored me. Nick Hornby's book addresses the mind of the ultimate Arsenal fanatic, himself, and attempts to explain to the world how football creates a world for him and an escape from the real world. It could make even the most die-hard Liverpool fans feel for Arsenal (it almost made me, a Man U fan, wish to go to the Arsenal stadium for a game, if only to experience football as he explains it). I would recommend this book to anyone with any affinity to English football, although it goes so far beyond that."
5,for fans of any sport,"This book is a great read. it is an autobiographical account of Horby'slife written as a series of match reports of Arsenal football matches. Each match report alsop includes refelections on his current strate of mind and events going on around him. Hornbys reflections on Heysel and hillsborough are very insighful and show how these disasters did not just affect the people and teams involved at the time but how the affected all fans of the sport.hornby is best known foer his ""male confessional"" books - High Fidelity and About a Boy. Fans of those novels should read Fever Pitch to get a better insight into Hornby's way of thinking. This is book that all football fans will love and relate too . However anyone who is an sereious fan of any sport will relate withg Horby's description of how his team became part of his life.read this book and find a small part of yourself in it!"
3,The story of a passion just like any other.,"Nick Hornby has written a book on the passion for a soccer team. In so doing, he showed two things: - that football-writting can reach high standards of quality, - that, despite his passion for Arsenal he had time for other things: reading, music, social life and for having the sense of his times.Hornby's novel is also a novel about growing up, about a country in change which will never be the same. Just like soccer will never be barren standing terraces. Easy to read, funny and talented. Football, may be for the first time, regarded as just another human craziness or addiction: reading, music, love, work ...All of them as irrational as ourselves.Nick, hoping Arsenal will clinch title this year, like in that unforgettable night at Anfield."
2,"Painfully, painfully boring","This book was extremely pointless. Since each entry is a memory, they are written like them so they don't have an insteresting story-telling narrative. Also, some of the entries were just how the game was played and who won, with absolutely nothing interesting to say. And that for 300 pages, completely redundant. This book has no beginning, middle, or end. Just entry after entry of complete pointlessness. Now, it may be because I am not interested in sports, but this is just a football (soccor) journal and nothing more. Hornby was able to shove in a little bit of angst and childhood problems, but it is not nearly significant enough to keep the reader interested.Though the book had some very funny parts, it doesn't make up for the ennui I experienced while reading this book. You know, they made a movie out a this.....HOW?!! It barely works as a piece of fiction or reference book...but a movie?! Jesus. I'm sorry but this was one of the most boring books I've ever read."
2,Chick Lit it ain't!,"I love Nick Hornby. I loved the movie Fever Pitch. I was more than prepared to love this book. I'm a woman. I think that's why this book was the most unbelievably boring book I'd read this year. Read anything else he wrote. Remember the the movies are always very loosely based on his books, but they're usually great reads in their own rights, just don't read this one. Yawn."
1,Absolute junk,"After ten minutes of reading this drivel I was compelled to return to a programming manual, this proving far more stimulating.The fact that people watch soccer (let alone read about it) leaves me cold about the future of our race. The ranting of a cockney hooligan may impress some people but what has that acheived for british society?? Hornby's witt is completely wasted on me and to be honest I was lost after the first chapter."
4,Good Story and brilliantly acted,"Apt Pupil, a very good movie from the Stephen King collection. Very powerful and surprizing, the acting was superb from Ian McKellen and the late Brad Renfro. This movie is in my top ten along side with Pulp Fiction, A few good men and The Usual Suspects."
2,Low Marks for Apt Pupil,"Poorly directed, written, and edited. This is about as suspenseful as an Easter Sunday sermon. A good idea badly handled."
4,Worth a read,"This is a good book to leaf through when you're heading to SF and already have a guide to all the usual stuff. I love visiting new places but can only take so many touristy day trips in a row. Finding other things to do is a great change of pace for a recharge day, instead of spending it at the beach/pool."
5,Perfect..,"This book is great for students, teachers and those who want to learn english grammar. Every section is explained by examples. It covers all rules and subjects."
5,A comprehensive and easy-to-use guide to English usage,I've had this book for about eight years (a previous edition) and have never had a doubt I couldn't take off in a minute with it. It's very easy to look up and there's cross-reference to related topics.The explanations range from informal spoken English to formal and literary written English; from basic usage to the most complex and tricky grammatical rules even native speakers have trouble with. Differences between Brittish and American English are also shown.I don't feel the need for any other similar book so far. This one is great!
5,Excellent,The book is alphabetically organised which is just so practical and easy to use. It explains things in an easy to understand English. I couldn't teach without it. Invaluable! Excellent buy!!!!
2,Complete should mean complete! Right?!,"Figured this would be a great resource to listen to each side they released to decide which ones I wanted to seek out and purchase on 45. It isn't complete at all which is a let down. Huge let down. BUT, that being said, it is 9 CDs of pretty great to wonderful music. Just feel like the title is very misleading."
2,Nowhere near the magnificence of Goldsmith.,"One of the worst moves that ""The Mummy Returns"" makes is not bringing back the composer of the first movie's score, Jerry Goldsmith, who spun a masterful creation combining romance and old-fashioned action with chills and thrills. His music played a big role in the first movie's success, so it is no surprise that the second movie, which hired Alan Silvestri to compose the score, fails in terms of generating emotion through the music. Silvestri is a wonderful score composer, but this score fails to bring much to the overall film."
5,Even better,"If you thought Mummy soundtrack was good, then this is even better. Combined with Live in the last track, this rocks!"
5,Great Pair of movies,This is a great combo of movies. each movie has its own case. well worth watching again on blue ray
4,A Good Escape,My rabid reader Father passed this book on to me & we both liked it. The author does a nice job of bringing Norse mythology into the modern world. I think most modern fantasy readers will enjoy this.
2,Not the best,"I like most environmental CDs but not this one. The sounds volume fluctuates way too much for me. If you're buying CDs to help you sleep, try this one last."
1,banging sounds,There are places in CD that startle you whith very loud clanging sounds out of the blue. This breaks the relaxing intent. Wish I hadn't ignored the other reviews that stated this also.
5,A great adventure.,I love to read non-fiction and this is a book that read like a novel. It was difficult to put down. I could picture every person in this story and got to know them personally. It also made me very proud of our service men and women and the work they are doing to rebuild Iraq.
5,excellent and informative,"I really enjoyed Colonel Bogdanos' book, ""Thieves of Baghdad"". I think that the book is well written. He includes background for the text and expands on premises, as needed, although he goes into detail about topics not related to the topic of the book. This was page-turning and quite compelling. I'm not sure how much of a part Mr. Patrick had in the writing of this book. I got a little annoyed with the author's self-glorification. Of course, I also must say that he is more of a hero and leader than I'd ever dream of being. Questions about the theft of the Baghdad Museum remain to be fully answered years now after the act. This book, however, provides the curious reader with a very good step toward finding out the truth, although, I believe, the topic may benefit from longer term follow-up by another source in years to come."
4,Wonderfully Romantic,"Just a fun, lite read. I would recommend it to those that love a good romance. Bookbub and Amazon are the best for offering free reads that I normally wouldn't have chosen"
4,Wonderful escape,This is an easy read. It is a fairy tale for women. Of Noble Birth is a great way to leave everyday life behind.
1,not impressed,I feel like I wasted my money with this book. I have downloaded over 90 books this year and this is the only one that I feel like I wasted my money on!
2,Sooooo slowwwww,"Great story, but seems the writer was paid per word. I had to scan pages and pages to get through stuff that could have been left out. Really didn't care for the ending either."
4,Very entertaining,"Loved it , very strong characters and not forgiving. Would have loved to see a reconciliation with Nathaniel and his sister."
5,CHUCK IS AWESOME!!!!!,This is the best show that was on tv it gets better and better every season this is my favorite show nothing can top this show it is the perfect show I suggest everyone buys all the seasons i just bought season 5 and can't wait for it to get here to watch it
1,Don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray version,"The Blu-Ray version is very grainy. The worst ""HD"" I've seen: it looks more like a bad up-conversion. I haven't seen the DVD version, but it can't be worse.Content-wise it seems to be a fine successor to Season One--I've only watched one episode so far--and would deserve 5 stars. Buy it; just don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray version."
5,DVD is better than Blue-Ray & The show is awesome!,"LOVE this show!!! And the DVD is better quality, extras and a menu unlike the blue-ray version. I say BUy it!"
5,My favorite show on TV and video!,"I came late to this party having discovered Chuck after 3 seasons had aired. I watched all 3 seasons on DVD in a matter of weeks and now I'm watching season 4 as it airs. There are few shows that I watch when they are broadcast on TV. I usually watch everything on my own schedule after it's been recorded on my DVR. But, I make a special effort to watch Chuck when it airs on NBC Mondays at 8:00 pm. I still record it because it is also one of my daughter's favorite shows and it comes on at her bedtime. So, I usually watch each week's episode at least twice. The acting is fantastic and I really enjoy the writing. Since I'm a child of the 1980s, I love all the 80s references. It's a great combination of action, romance and comedy. I really hope it can stay on the air as long as possible! Viva Buy-Moria!"
5,"A show for any age. This is how you make smart, funny television.","This show is a pure unadulterated joy to experience. If you have not given this show a chance, don't miss out on one of the best shows out there. You will not regret it!"
2,Missing the 3D disk.,Its a good show but be warned when buying the set I'am still missing the 3d disk and glasses. I contacted Amazon and they said they would send me the dvd.
4,Finally good humor,"The TV series Chuck is a funny and quirky comedy with, Love, adventure and a little bit of personal insights from all characters in the small world they live and protect."
5,chuck season 1,"love the show!! it is great!! hope they keep makin the show for seasons to come!However, the blu-ray is a little grainy. Not as clear as I expected. Have played it on different TVs and Blu-ray players and still get the same result. Not sure why."
3,Not as useful as it could have been,"There is a lot of good information in this book, but the presentation makes it difficult to find. The index is too general and it's often hard to locate or distinguish between subsections.It's also written in a very formal, academic style, which makes it difficult for the learner without a strong background in linguistics."
1,the description is not match with the product,"I bought this watch for my friend, in the description it says that it has black leather strap, but after my friend receive it, the strap color was blue, as the product didn't match with the description, we then asked for a replacementbut after the replacement arrived, we were very dissapointed because it still has the same color with the first onethere should be a correction in this product description"
5,"""Room's on fire,""My all time favorite song","""Rooms on Fire,"" is one of the greatest songs every recorded. I was on vacation when this album came out,and I played this one song to death. I also enjoyed alot of the other records on this CD,with help from Bruce Hornsby and Kenny G. But ""Rooms on fire"" is a Masterpiece."
1,Evolutionary explanations don't hold up.,"Klein is of the opinion that men were not intelligent enough to move large rocks, among other things, so aliens gave them the know how. I would definately recommend Dr. Ken Ham's website, [...] where there are excellent articles on how men did accomplish many great feats."
4,A good but not perfect booklight,"This new version of the itty bitty light from Zelco is improved in some areas but in others not as good as the familiar previous versions of the itty bitty. The neon light is just right for ageing eyes and the little recorder is surprisingly useful. Nice to be able to record a thought or something you need to do without putting down the book you are reading. But I find the limited range of motion of the light head prevents me using the light in all the ways I would like. It cannot be turned around backwards or raised up to a near vertical position so it has to be used clipped to the book rather than propped up by my pillow, and it is a little heavy. Magazines in particular don't support it well. The chromed clip reflects light back in my eyes but that was resolved with a piece of tape. A good light that could be a great light with a few mods."
5,GREAT!!!,"This cd was chris rocks early material, it's a little raw and unorginized compared to his later work (biger and blacker), but still hilarious. Before you get this you might want to get chris rocks other stuff like roll with the new, but I did and I heard this and it is great. Chris Rock is one of the few african american comedians whose material is funny to all, a rich white buisness man will laugh at the same joke that the black guy at the gas station will laugh at. He is easily the best comedian of our generation, if not all time."
1,SOME of the Soundtrack from Goodfellas,"What a DISSappointment! Although this film is certainly one of the best all time, and a personal fav of mine, this soundtrack is only a partial compilation at best. At worst, one could easily make the point that the best songs of the movie are all missing. What about ""Monkey Man"" by the Rolling Stones? What about--and this is THE climax of the movie--when ""Jump Into The Fire"" by Nilsson is playing? C'mon, who made this disk anyway? They should be ashamed."
2,sadly lacking,"it doesn't have the sex pistols ""i did it my way."" that song defines the movie and they left it off. thoroughly dissapointed."
1,Where's the music?,"What a disappointment! This is only a fraction of the great soundtrack. ""Pretend you don't see her"" by Jerry Vale is completely missing here as well as a slew of other great hits. I hope Scorsese gets it right the second time around if he ever gets down to business in putting together ""Goodfellas: The Collector's Edition."" Martin...you reading this?"
5,SAVE THE SHARKS!,I got this for Christmas. I love it. I sleep with it every night! So cute and huggable. I love Wild Republic's toys. I have the hammerhead plushies and the whale shark plushie also. They get along great with each other. I would recommend these toys to anyone! ^-^
4,What you see is ...,"Purchased this as a gift for someone who (alone with myself) loves the sounds and sights of a good thunderstorm. After looking over several similar CD's this is the one I went with. I was not disappointed as this is just as is seems. The CD is essentially just one large album of a rolling storm. You get the clashes along with the quite rumbling mixed in throughout. We enjoy the sounds, and were happy with the purchase."
1,"Sounds great, if you could get it shipped to you",I ordered this CD on August 15 and still hadn't received it by early November. They kept sending me emails stating that the shipment was delayed and asking whether I wanted to approve an extension. I received seven of these before giving up and cancelling the order. Don't get your hopes up on this one.
3,Thundering Rainstorm,"Unfortunately, this CD was defective. Once you open them you can't return them. Sorry to say, the other CD is defectivealso. They both skip when you try to replay them continually so I have to wake up and start the CD over. If they weren'tdefective I am sure I would love them."
2,Rain on a tin roof,"The price is right, but if you are looking for the roll and crash of thunder, look out for all the rain that seems to drone on and on, leaving the viewer wondering where the real storm went. Dig deeper and spend your money on another CD in this catagory, you will be glad you did."
5,Relaxing Thunderstorms,Not much to say about these CDs. They work like a sleeping pill for me no matter how wired I am. Once I finally get to bed it only takes about five minutes to put me to sleep.
5,Goodness!,"I bought this one for my collection simply because she is quite sexy and she is the spiting image of a special friend of mine. I swear she, my friend, must have modeled for this one. This is an excellent price for this particular figurine. If I remember correctly, I paid much, much more than this sale price, more like above the original price they have printed here. When my friend is one the road, I like to glance at my little warrior on the shelf and think of her. All in all, I was pleased with this one. She adds much to my collection"
5,Deeper Reading,"Deeper Reading is one of my favorite language arts resources. As an 8th grade teacher, I am constantly looking for ways to improve reading and reading comprehension in my students. Whether you are dealing with low ability, reluctant, or gifted students, the lessons Kelly Gallagher presents lead students to ""deeper reading"" in fiction and nonfiction text. (My classes are especially fond of his lesson on creating metaphors when analyzing characters during reading.) Our middle school bought copies of this book for the staff and created after school book discussion groups to encourage implementation of the strategies in this valuable resource."
3,Ok reading .,"Im quite disappointed with this book.The first 60 pages were written in a very simplistic way,the way u expect a teenager to write.It hardly kept my interest until the writing improved,however,as the story unraveled I found my self skippin the Too many steamy scenes and often put the book down.As much as I loved Forbidden ,also by Darrin Lowery this book was just ok ,the plot was not original and not particularly insightful .Note to the author:I dont think u should review your own books,If u want to leave a note to the readers u should do it using the main page tools."
4,A beautiful movie,This is a beautiful story with great acting. The music is wonderful. Highly recommended!
3,What's the deal???,"I was very disappointed when I received this DVD for several reasons. Amazon.com and the DVD case itself states that it is a two-sided disc, with both fullscreen and widescreen formats, yet when I opened the case, it's only a one sided disc and only has a fullscreen format. The format isn't really what upset me the most though... I was really ticked off to find that the love scene in this movie was completely chopped up... it was a completely different scene from when I first saw this movie... So I'd really like to know wtf is up with that? The movie was completely ruined without the full love scene... The love scene in the DVD I purchased is missing about 30 seconds and has a completely different ending. Is there another version of this movie that I'm unaware of???? Even though this particular version of the movie sucked, in my opinion, it's still a good movie that's worth seeing."
3,Swept from the Sea,This movie wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be. I probably wouldn't order it again if I had known it.
3,okay,It a love story that is sad and the village has some prejudices to overcome and I always find myself getting irritated with those kinds of movies.
3,If you liked Wuthering Heights...,"This was a nice movie for a rainy day - if you liked Wuthering Heights, you will enjoy this movie."
5,PERFECT ACCESSORY FOR MY LITTLE DRUMMER!,This was purchased as a gift for my stepson who is in his high school band as well as a band of his own. He loves it! Works great and suits his drum set perfectly!
1,High-capacity inkjet Cartridge is misleading,"I paid more for this cartridge than I had been paying for cartridges I bought in sets of 6 because these were labeled high-capacity and the others had no such description. When I opened the package, I discovered zero difference between this higher priced cartridge and the others I had been buying on Amazon.com as genuine Epson cartridges."
1,For Professionals only,Great book for highly trained chefs who have access to all the ingredients used in this book. Other than using this book to study the art of food presentation the general public will never use it. I have well over 100 books and have cooked for family and friends all of my adult life but this was over the top.A waste of 50.00$
2,Not so Great,I was very disappointed with the contents of this CD. The music was not exactly Glenn Miller's greatest hits. They were just the short cuts!
2,Wave Yoga Short,"Inner Waves makes a similar product that fits better, is more comfortable, is tough and looks good.These shorts are baggy and do not have a great look to them. The material kind of bunches and does not have clean lines. Having said that, they are functional and are fine to practice yoga in, they just don't look good and are not worth the high price."
3,The Opposite of Sex (1998),"Interesting movie about a young woman who learns that people aren't all bad, that family and relationships can in fact be a good thing.I have to admit this movie didn't do much for me. There were some some funny parts but overall the movie did not move me. Perhaps it's the fact that none of the characters were very believable or that I didn't identify with them or, most likely, that I found the protagonist truly annoying.The dialog was well done, witty with a good mix of humour.Special FeaturesTrailer was good and didn't give away too much of the movie. I enjoyed watching the deleted scenes and watching them again with the director's commentary.Recommend: MaybeWatch Again: Probably Not"
4,A comedy of (bad) manners.,"A deliciously catty comedy that deserved all the acclaim it received when it was released theatrically. Christina Ricci takes the ball and runs with it in a signature performance as DeeDee Truitt, an acid-tongued teen who gets into all sorts of trouble when she moves in to live with her brother. The film is something of an acquired taste, and the humor may be a bit too racy for some. Already-established fans should definitely grab this one while first-time viewers might want to give this a rental to see if it's their cup of tea."
2,the opposite of fun,"This movie starts off interesting, with Ricci narrating some acerbic, comedic lines and giving us hope that we are about to be in for something really offbeat and good. Enter the always annoying Lisa Kudrow who proves adept, once again, at whining, complaining and acting as if she is going to burst out laughing at any moment. If she were more interesting to watch, perhaps we could stomach her blatant self-consciousness. Some of the ""Friends"" should just stick to stupid television shows.The negative (and not funny enough) stereotyping of gays and the endlessly pointless and agitating dialogue forced me to make my ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" moment of shutting the movie off about halfway through. I moved on to Pandaemonium - a movie infinitely more worthy of your time!"
2,Overrated Token Gay Sub-Plot,"A very disappointing movie. The main character, played by Christina Ricci, displays foul behavior which seems so contrived, I am inclined to blame the Director instead of the actor.An otherwise interesting plot really loses all appeal after the first 30 minutes of the film."
4,A pretty good dark comedy,"This movie was quite funny. It's nice to see Christina Ricci being in a more normal movie, seeing as how she is normally playing a depressed gothic person. This movie is about a teenage girl, Deedee (Ricci), who goes to live with her half-brother,Billi, who is a homosexual. Soon, Deedee steals Bill's boyfriend, Matt, and he gets Deedee pregnant. As a result, Deedee and Matt run away to Vegas and get married. While Bill and Lucia (Lisa Kudrow) try to track the two of them down, many funny things happen along the way...but I'll just keep my mouth shut and let you be suprised. You should go see this. However, if people cursing a lot offends you, maybe you wouln't like this movie very much."
4,Good little film...,"I had to write a response to the previous reviewer's complaints about Johnny Galecki's performance as a gay man. Yes, he's over-the-top and, yes, Hollywood needs to make films with gay men that are less stereotypical. But, you can't deny that guys like Galecki exist and he certainly is not a sympathetic character to begin with. I know lots of queens like him and felt his performance was true to that. Now, off the soapbox...lol. If you like funny, disturbing films and aren't offended by unusual themes or strong language, you'll like this. Ricci is great and Lisa Kudrow should have been nominated for an Oscar. She finally nabs a role that lets her get away from the ditzy Phoebe-type characters she's slowly becoming typecast in. She's great, as is the cast as a whole. If you liked 'Go' or 'Election', you'll like this, too."
5,Turns a stressful trip into a fun ride!!,"The wheels are great, I got four in one package, they are very sturdy and easy to snap on to your Marchioro carriers. First make sure you have a Marchioro carrier as it doesn't fit other brands and that you are ordering the right size. Marchioro makes different wheels for the different size carriers they sell. Also, get a strap because the carrier handle will be too low (assuming you buy it for a cat/small/medium pet carrier as this size is only meant for smaller carriers). It'll be much more fun for you and your pet, especially in airports, train, metro or bus stations when you also have other luggage or children to keep track of!!"
5,A good book for intermediate to power users!,"This is the perfect book for tech savvy users who are able to think outside of the box. The explanation of the commands and reasons for needing them is very well presented and isn't too technical. However, some lessons will take you longer that 10 minutes to understand, so don't let the title fool you. Even still, reading this book has really set me on fire for Linux!"
4,Poignant & Funny,"A well-crafted short in which I especially liked the acting. Appropriately one-dimensional, the actors all created a visceral response: Lisa's natural sadness, Jenna rushing her funny one-liners as if perpetually late for a date, Ty's snaky smile and oily delivery. Kudos to the director for restraining them. The plot did cause me to scratch my head at a couple of points (bar scene with Ty and the ending) and the score was sometimes reminiscent of Dark Shadows. I recommend this as an amusing and sometimes poignant film."
5,"Once upon a bad hair day...a prince rode up Rapunzel's way,","This is a ""must have"" book for any child's library. Both children and adults will enjoy this funny story about a Rapunzel who mis-hears each request of the prince, who is trying to rescue her. Here is a small sample of the story:Rapunzel, Rapunzel, throw down your hair!She thought he said, ""Your underwear.""""No Rapunzel. Your curly locks!""Rapunzel threw down dirty socks.""Please, love, just your silky tresses!""She thought he asked for silky dresses.In lace and frills up to his head,the prince's cheeks were blushing red.And so on, and so on, this enchanting poem continues with a happy, but funny ending. The illustrations in this book are very colorful and amusing, and each one sentence rhymn has a hilarious picture to go along with it. This book will never be boring no matter how many times you read it!"
5,My 17mo. old loves it!,This fun book was a gift for my then 1yr old daughter - and she still loves it at 17mo (one of a handful of books she lets me read beginning to end to her.) The rhyming is hilarious and pictures are silly and fun. Highly recommend.
3,Hate ultraviolet digital copies,"The movies are fine, the ultimate edition is great but the mayor disappointment is that unlike the other six movies this 2 does not have a disc with the digital copy, and some of us are overseas and the ultraviolet site does not work in all contries."
2,Difficult to understand - Some Mistakes,"A Twelve Year Old finds this book very hard to understand who has been playing chess for 3 years. I may not be perfect my self in English, but there are lots of mistakes so this would not make a text book at any school.There is some nice stuff in the book covering some important ideas."
3,For Novice to Mid-Range Players,"I don't believe this book will make you a master. How many masters are there of the Silman School of Chess? I do think this will help novices to mid-range players (elo 1000 to 1400). The best part are the chapters on the imbalances between the minor pieces. There are a lot of typoes in this edition, and tactics are pretty much left out, which I think is a big mistake. All in all, though, this is a classic for beginner to mid-range level players."
3,Good but not great,"I consider this book to offer a good insight into how to analyze. However, there sometimes are areas in the book that are unclear and there are some significant typos."
2,Not really the best,"I found this book to have too many mistakes in it. The concepts were good, but the quality provided by the proofreader was poor."
5,1300-1700USCF in 2 yrs thx to this and 5 other books,"Forget Nimzo! Read this instead. If youre a beginner OR an intermediate like myself, You will find Nimzo a little diffucult to understand. Silman is a precursor to Nimzo. Silman's concept of ""imbalances"" is SO good how come no one thought of explaining positional concepts in this manner before? The other 5 books are: 1. Chess tactics for students by Bain. 2. Essential chess endings by Silman. 3. chess training pocket book by Alburt. 4. Chess master at any age by Wetzell. 5. The ideas behind the chess openings by Fine. Start with Bain first then use the other 5 in combination. The KEY is to ANALYSE your OWN GAMES using a computer for tactics and a strong (at least 300pts highter than yourself) human for positional play. Then store the important concepts into chess computer software. Finally, review these concepts so that you know them like the back of your hand. Discipline yourself and good luck!"
5,One of the very best instructional books ever written,"This book helped me to become an Expert and is helping me to (hopefully) become a Master. As a guide to positional chess, it is less advanced than Nimzowitsch's My System but every bit as important. Indeed, without knowing the basic concepts explained here, I doubt if it's possible to understand Nimzowitsch. If it has a fault, it would be that a reader could easily get the impression that positional ideas are more importaant than tactics."
3,"Some things taught great, some can improve much","This book i would reccommend to any beginner who: 1) Doesnt understand minor pieces play 2) Needs to improve middle game thought process 3) Plays without any type of plan, just waits for things to happen 4) As a bonus he explains excellently i think some concepts of endgame theory.The cons are: 1) Ego trips galore, as in how many of his moves are described as brilliant,magnificent not to mention the amount of his games analyzed. 2) Some sections are too shallow and seem to come from others ideas. 3) Few board illustrations compared with other books and many typoes."
1,Don't waste your money,The auther is exagerating alot in his description. Many things he refered to were false
1,One thing I agree with D'Souza,"""America is the greatest, freest, and most decent society in existence""And that is because of liberalism. The more the conservative agenda gets put in place, the more my freedoms are curtailed, the more I see decency being assaulted.For that reason, Mr Dinesh book is superfluous, and that explains my low rating. For America to remain great, we need to be liberal. After all, upon examination of its etymology, ""liberal"" means free."
5,What's So Great About America?,"An outstanding and timely book. D'Souza, a legal immigrant, clearly and without overlooking the errors made by America tells us clearly what it is that is so great about America, and what it means to be an American. In an age in which we have lived in the entanglesd hypocrisy of multi-culturalism and the dictates of ""politically-correct"" thinking, D'Souza comes on stage with a clear and refreshing message.A must read for every American who is open-minded and desires to see this country succeed."
1,Everyone from the third world thinks this is a great country,"which is why they have all moved here. Compared to India it is great. I think the point that he is missing is that native born Americans do not recognize this country as being the same one that we grew up in. This country was Great; but has been steadily declining in every area since 1965. It was great because our ancestors died fighting to make it that way. It has morphed into a capitalistic, violent, immoral society with native born Americans forced into second class citizenship."
5,A must-read for the long-time American,"This is a quick but essential read for many Americans who are struggling to make sense of the post 911 world. For those of us far removed from our imigrant past, this book serves up a refresher course in what we take for granted every day of our lives. D'Souza's observations are scholarly but very much to the point. His discussion of how Islamic fundamentalists view America and Americans is sobering to say the least."
4,"Only an introduction, but a pretty good one","Both editors are professors at Ehime University in Matsuyama, both working in fields relating to England language education, and they have put together a collection of twenty-eight relatively brief essays -- all written by fourth-year students and then polished with the help of the faculty -- on such key attitudes, patterns of behavior, traditions, and social underpinnings. These include group consciousness, the Japanese and ambiguity, personal space, childrearing, the Japanese sense of beauty, male/female relationships, seniority, and other topics that often are puzzling to Westerners. The writing is uniformly clear, even when explaining complex concepts, and there's a detailed bibliography (much of it to works in Japanese, however). A very informative resource for any American trying to figure out the Japanese."
3,academic in nature,"This book is well written. It was written to be used in a class room setting (the book states this) If I would have know I wouldn't have purchased it. I was looking for a more personal,engaging insight on the way of life in Japan. The book is laid out nicely and still a good read, just a bit too text like."
4,Don't Listen to ...,"This CD is a triumphant return for Blues Traveler. I bought Blues Traveler's 1st album in 1991 and ever since I have followed the band's music pretty closely. The last two albums did not do much for me, but this one does. It is filled with inspired lyrics and musicianship. If you dig the BT sound, but lost interest when they ventured into the radio world pick up this cd. The review by ... is a joke. Open the sunroof, turn it up and enjoy! Great music by a great band."
4,WOW...I am amazed..,"Got this today..I am over joyed. There are so many great tracks on here. I Love the song Just for Me. Such a good rhythm to it. There is a lot of ""angry?"" john popper on here, but that doesnt detract from the album at all...its just different. But Lots and I mean lots of great harmonica work. Album really flows well too. And MAN...John Popper has lost a ton of weight! YAY for Him.. Some of the tracks can get quite funky..but thats what makes this album unique. This one will stay in the cd player for a while..I can be sure of that."
1,The conservative agenda gets in the way!,"I purchased this book after enjoying an exhibit of Hudson River School paintings. While the premise of the book is an interesting one, I couldn't get past the conservative politics! It was Newt Gingrich's quote & the mention of Lynne Cheney as a harbinger of moral change that pushed me over the edge. I was hoping to gain a further appreciation of the genre, but found myself too iritated by the modern day political commentary to keep reading. If you have BOTH an appreciation of the school & a conservative political outlook--this is probably the book for you. However, if you find conservative definitions of morality and cultural standards off-putting, don't bother with this one!"
3,Too much time developing characters too strange.,"Buechner's latest has left me feeling like this novel was rather lackluster. The characters and their relations to one another became confusing over time, and far too much time was spent developing them, only to have them do basically nothing. Buechner seems to try too hard in this novel to make his characters ""unusual,"" giving them odd quirks that, over time, make them unbelievable. Also, there is virtually no movement of the plot -- the entire 200-page book is spent developing characters, only to have them radically change, reconciling past differences, suddenly in the last few pages. For all the plot development in this novel, it perhaps would have served better as a short story or novella, rather than a full-blown novel. Buechner is a gifted writer, whose work I have enjoyed in the past; this novel, however, left me feeling like I was reading about characters who did nothing, and about whom I cared little about."
5,Excellent,"I can't even express how happy I am that Onry Ozzborn and JFK are on a major label. Now the rest of America (and Canada) will have the opportunity to hear some of the most talented rappers in the last few years. Buy it now, dammit!!!"
5,Consumer Protection,I found this book to be an excellent resource for citizens who need to protect themselves from this type of victimization.
2,Agreed with it being wrong item,"As previously mentioned, the page describes a BC60 battery but you get a BC50. Not worth the hassle of fixing the problem. Just be warned if they haven't fixed this product page that you'll be getting a BC50. Also don't expect quick replies to any inquires. Overall not the best experience"
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"The first major turn off of this book is the insistance that Native Americans crossed the land bridge to inhabit the lands known as the United States. After many, many decades, I find it appalling that authors continue to perpertrate this myth! With that in mind, I didn't care to read any further into the book as I really did not want to be confronted with more writings that perchance were historically inaccurate. The author's lack of attention to this type of Native American historical detail is a huge thumbs down."
4,really great cd,Unlike other people I select stars very carefully. 4/5 stars means this is a really really good cd. Here And Now is far and away the best track however the others are quite good as well and make for a very good quality cd. Overall I was extremely impressed by this cd and recommend it to all. It is one of those cds that you can repeat over and over and not get tired of. For fans of 90s rock music this is a must have.
2,meh.,"The book itself for the most part is ok.Would not recommend it for beginner though since the way logic is presented through the book is very rigorous and thus unnecessarily complex is its wording.There are absolutely no solutions to any of the problems which means this book has no point of having been published since only the writer's students may buy it and actually use it effectively.Since the author assumes many things and not all of the material presented within the book is conventional some example of usage would have cleared up the proofs and theorems but again this book is lacking this.In brief:- No solutions to a single problem and hardly any examples (if any).- Very wordy, horrible worded statements lead to misunderstandings."
5,Excellent series,"This is an excellent series from the same people that brought you ""Wonderfalls"" and ""Dead Like Me"" (which are also wonderful).This dark, yet visually stunning, series follows the life of a pie maker turned private investigator with the all-to convenient ability (or curse) to bring people back to life. To paraphrase the narrator: ""solving crimes is easy when you can ask the victim who killed him"".The love story, something I usually despise, is made fresh and interesting because the lovers cannot touch (they kiss each other through saran wrap).This show is for people with plenty of imagination who enjoy witty, dry comedy."
5,Will no longer watch ABC.,"Each and every episode was amazing. This is what television should/could be. Too bad ABC didn't know a good thing when they had it.ABC pulls the plug on PD, I pull the plug on ABC."
5,No more Pie Man,Good acting...good characters...with a plot twist at the end of every episode. Great special effects and I like how they call him The Pie Man. Wish that there were more seasons.
5,pushing daisies... I miss the show already...,".... very nice followup second season, as the story gets you more and more anxious to see the next episode... but then things abruptly are wrapped up in the end, so I was left a bit upset and wanting more... unfortunately, there are no more visits to the Pie Hole... EVER... with all the Emmy noms and wins, you'd think ABC would have a clue to continue, or put it on one of their other cable channels... then again, we're talking about the stupid media..."
5,"So much fun! Plays out like a good ol' Scooby Do ""whodunnit?""","I thoroughly enjoyed this episode! Ned and the gang investigate the murder of a magician while Ned and Charlotte each delve deeper into the secrets of their own pasts and their connections with their birth parents.The gang's antics in the magic hall have it all...stopping just short of pulling a mask off an old man shaking his fist and saying, ""And if it wasn't for those meddling kids, I would've got away with it!""Good stuff!"
4,Great Speed and power!,My only complaint about this drive is that it isn't bundled with Roxio Toast. But that was an inexpensive upgrade since this is not my first CDR. A couple of 100 disc spools down and who knows how many more to go. I had to burn 50 hybrid CDs for one job and this drive made very short work of it. This drive is supported by Toast versions 4.1 and up. I use this drive to back up data at work and to transfer my record collection to CD. Audio CDs burn in only 6 minutes or less.I also like the size and firewire connection. Usually it sits next to my G4 but it's small enough to fit in my laptop case so I can use it with my ibook.
4,Revival Music,Some of the songs are arranged differently from the original. Still not bad listening!
4,Pablo Cruise Greatest Hits,"If you like Pablo Cruise, and don't have any of their CD's, this is one you will enjoy. Has all the hits from the late 70's and early 80s. Brought back some great memories for me when I listened to it the first time. If you want more from Pablo Cruise, buy ""A Place In The Sun"" or ""World's Away"". But for me, this was the perfect CD."
2,Still trying to figure this out,I bought this together with the unit and have all this stuff to piece together and it is quite a contraption. Works well if you want to go to all that trouble.
4,satisfied customer,"very satisfied with planatronics, the behind the ear part could be a lilttle thinner, but overall It is just what i was looking for"
4,The London Murders,"This was a very interesting plot. The characters were each different and well described. However, I can't believe that one man, Gregory Hansen, no matter how charming, could really have so many women all falling for him at the same time. Are women really as stupid as Jacintha, to pursue the same man for 15 years when he has had numerous women friends?It seems that some of these characters should be in a teen romance rather than an adult novel. Kate Ashenberry was a likable character. I enjoyed her relationship with her cat,Horatio. This is not really a mystery but more of a supense story. A fun plot.Alice Kingsbury"
5,Still a favorite,"Even though ""DIRT"" was released back in the early '90s, it still sounds as fresh and current as anything out there today. From the thundering intro of ""Them Bones"" to the haunting final track,""Would?"", not a bad track on this disc. I wouldn't lump them into that ""grunge"" label. Yes, they're from Seattle, and yes, there are elements of that style in their music, but there's far more going on with their songs than just a bunch of noise. Haunting lyrics from the late Layne Staley, and crunching riffs from guitarist Jerry Cantrell highlight their best release, and one that everyone should own."
5,"Alice In Chains 1992, ""Dirt""","This album right here is classic 90s grunge rock and is a great heavy album. Along with this Nirvana is cool too. Some key tracks on here are, them bones, dam that river, and angry chair etc. Alice In Chains is a really good band and all the songs sound really good. A classic album buy it today"
5,Essential Grunge CD,"If you have not already heard any of the songs off this album then I don't know what you were doing during the early 90's but you obviously weren't paying attention to music. For those of you who have heard some of the songs you know what great songs they are, what you might not know is that all the ones you haven't heard yet are equally great too. You can't beat songs like Angry Chair, Godsmack, Would?, and Down In A Hole. If you liked any of the music that came out of the early 90's and don't own this album yet I don't know what your problem is, this is as essential as it gets."
3,a good pop album for the dark and dreary,"I definitely hear the depression, dreary, and dark melodies. This music doesn't do much for me. Yes their is some talent from the guitarist and the song writing...but ultimately it just leaves me unsatisfied. I have never really enjoyed being depressed by music, in fact I enjoy music that does about everything but leave me depressed. If you like heavy, dark, moody, depressed feelings listen to the SWANS album COP/YOUNG GOD.As a recovering junkie, I can't listen to these vocals without being overly aware of their obvious nature. I always mourn the passing of a fellow junkie and understand the constant fight, and brooding fades but I also respect myself enough not to wallow in the darkness. Depression begets depression. I respect the ideas and contribution, but I need more. PEACE"
5,SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LOST BOYS SOUNDTRACK,"... Alice in Chains was a wonderful group of artists, I remember this album more than any other as having a tremendous impact on the music industry.In terms of talent and musicianship, I think Alice in Chains had all other Seattle acts blown away with this release. This album meant a tremendous amount to me and still does, without such an album acts like Staind would have no material.... Like many great releases, this one reminds me of instances in my life and seems to bring me back to them, like some sort of time machine. Kurt Cobaine still does that for me, as does Bradley Nowell. I will miss Layne Staley, he was a wonderful artist.With any luck, The Dirt release will now be looked back upon for its value, and fewer ... bands will freely copy the style and get their own, I doubt it though. That might actually mean applying effort."
5,One of the 90s top 10 albums.,"All the other reviews here pretty much covered everything. Everything, that is, except Layne Staley's vocals. Layne Staley sings the best harmony vocals of anyone in the 90s. (Also check out Chris Cornell's work on ""Reach Down"" from Temple of the Dog). Though his voice isn't the sweetest around, he still manages to crank out intricate vocal arrangements that will amaze the listener who pays attention to them. Take the verses of ""Rain When I Die,"" for instance. Layne Staley takes a droning, repetetive, otherwise boring vocal and makes it shine with a harmony from Jerry Cantrell and another one from himself. ""Down in a Hole"" is no less astounding. What another reviewer has said let me repeat: ""An essential album for any child of the 1990s. Awesome."""
5,7th Heaven Winter Ball,This is a great book and Lucy has to face a lot of dicisions about doing something illegal but will she do it? read to find out. This book is great for unger readers because it has a greatmoral.
4,understanding the finite element method,"This book carries on from the first edition, lots of new theories and programs have been added. The errors in the last edition(1996) have been corrected. This book is a must for people who want to understand the finite element method and for people who want to learn how to program it using 'Matlab'. Matlab is one of the most widely used programming tool.I have the old edition but i find this new edition refreshing. The new theories and programs help in digesting the book better.overall this is an indispensable book for people trying to learn to program the finite element method because it gives a clear understanding of how a finite element code works.thanks,kartik srinivas"
4,strictly commercial,"The Captain has a long and storied career, playing with Zappa and other creative folks.This is his attempt at mainstream music and I find that it's easy listening for acid rock. Haunting melodies that hold their own over time.Good stuff. Uncomplicated."
1,If I could rate this book a -1 I would,"The book has a fatal flaw, and that is its complete, total, absolute lack of footnotes, references or bibliographies. There is no reasonable way to verify which of Hitchens' quotes are made up and which are not made up.For instance, on page 63 Hitchens quotes George Stephanopoulos as having said ""For eight months of 1995 and 1996, Morris was the president.""Now, George Stephanopoulos may in fact have said that. Then again, he may not have. No way to tell, because Hitchens cannot be arsed --to use an Anglicism-- to tell us the source.Indeed, this book cites no sources whatever! Not one! As a work one could reference in researching President Clinton it is less than worthless."
1,Horrible yet typical British misunderstanding of success,"Christopher Hitchins has done nothing more here than to try and advance the flawed socialist agenda of the Brits. Putting down Truman, moking the open success of the American system, and just generally trying to peddle his shallowness as being intellectual is sickening. The beauty of the United States is that it is self correcting. Hitchins uses a ""cram it down your throught"", British ideology that emmulates Clinton and Gore tactics. Hitchins could not have missed the mark further. Tell me Christopher, why is it you work in these great United States if jolly old england's failed philosophy is your basis for existence? But, don't go home. Shut up, open your mind and learn about how successful nations work."
2,Slanderous,"I consider myself a patriot, and am not highly enamored of my Commander-in-chief, but he IS my Commander-in-Chief, and he is out of office in one year so I wish to high heaven that all of the Clinton bashers would just give it a rest, we're all sick and tired of it. Savor our great heritage instead, enjoy a patriotic, uplifting novel like THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY or THE BRIDGES OF TOKO-RI, and quit handing your book dollars over to sleaze like Hitchins."
4,More than just a hatchet job,"Hitchens wittily summarizes Clinton's failings, he shows how this President survived by accepting conservative policies while mouthing the gospel of political correctness. In this, as in other ways, Clinton is the Democrat's answer to Nixon, who governed as a liberal while exploiting the prejudices of the right. Hitchens sees this connection, and, even more clearly, sees how morally and intellectually bankrupt the ""left"" has become."
2,Not worth the $$$,"The first 3 movies were the best but after part 3 the series went downhill and weren't funny anymore. In this box set u get all 7 films of the series from which only the first 3 are worth buying, parts 4,5,6 are very mediorce and part 7 is UNWATCHABLE so i reccomend you to buy the first 3 movies and avoid this box set at least with that price. It's not worth it. If the price falls to arround $30 then go for it."
5,condition/product rating,The order was in perfect condition and the movies were great. I had not seen all of the movies before and they were funny.
1,Why? WHY?!?,"Why don't films such as James Cagney's ""White Heat"" get released, but THIS abomination does??? Lord Almighty, are you playing a cruel, twisted joke by allowing the most horrible film series (until Paul W. S. Anderson came to Hollywood, that is) to be released instead of titles that deserve to be?"
2,Inaccurate,"As a former academy dropout myself, it's a little hard to watch these films and laugh. They're simply so inaccurate as to be incredibly annoying. I mean, if our actual academies were anything like this, what would our law enforcement look like? Whew! It may be funny to laugh at, but I say let's all be thankful that these are just films, right?"
3,"Classic instrumental, but too much supplemental","""Green Onions"" was originally recorded as the B-side to what was intended as their debut single, ""Behave Yourself,"" but ended up reaching #1 in the R&B charts and becoming Booker T. & The MG's most famous tune. This album was quickly assembled around those two songs to capitalize on the success of the million-selling single. Along with a follow-up jam, ""Mo' Onions,"" they recorded nine mediocre covers of previous hits by Ray Charles, the Isley Brothers, Jackie Wilson, and Acker Bilt. I'd recommend this album only if you don't plan on investing in the wonderful ""Time Is Tight"" box set, which contains the best tracks off this disc, the three originals."
3,Pitfalls for excellent music,"Ha! This is where Music started to go down into a big hole (and it has bounced back, believe me! (why believe you Tnahpellee?). A great looking person on the cover who probably doesn't add any vocals to it, usually wearing next to nothing, and followed by a litany of allegations, lawsuits and samples.However, the music here is really good, even if you don't really know who is singing the songs! Whoever belts out 'Fantasy' just belted out one of the best soul songs of the 90's! So powerful, surreal, well 'dreamy'. The techno songs are pretty good with soulful singing throughout but could have been better if they provided the originals rather than the remixes of tracks like 'Everybody everybody'. And then there's a couple of easy-listening instrumentals that, at the very least, provide a change of pace.So, if you like techno-dance/pop-house music with a festival mood and like unrelated supermodels on the front cover, then, by all means, check it out. Rating ***"
2,Why bother?,"This disc is a waste of time and money. A lot of the 20th Century Masters CDs are ok for certain artists but in this case it was a very bad idea. There were too many songs done by this classic rock powerhouse to limit the choice to only 10. There are better compilations of The Who out there for sure. For $14.98 you can buy the 2 disc set ""The Ultimate Who Collection"" and get much more bang for the buck."
1,"Great Band, Terrible Compilation","How can you make a ""The Best of the Who"" without hits like ""Baba O'Riley"" or ""You Better You Better You Bet"" or ""Bargain""? It is not like the cd is pressed for space. This cd is an insult to the Who and to anyone dumb enough to buy it."
3,"The who is Great, but screw their record company","Don't get me wrong, The Who are one of the best rock groups ever. MCA has released way to many greatest hits records. All of these songs are on past compilation albums. Well on a good note, the pictures are small but interesting. I would rather just buy the box set."
3,allright,"Usually i dont like greatest hits cd's but this one wasnt bad, but i suggest to spend more money and buy their better albums like quadriphonia"
4,Don't Leave Home Without It,I don't leave home without my Kleen Kanteen and its Built NY neoprene wrap. You can toss the wrap in the washer and it cleans up nicely. The only problem I had was with the snap. After about a year of hard use the snap came loose from the fabric and I had to fix it but I give this thing a workout on a daily basis so I guess you can't fault the product. You get what you pay for here.
5,"Easy to install, looks and works awesome",These vent shades were so easy to install (less than 15 minutes). They fit perfectly. They work very well and look awesome. Amazon had the best price (big surprise!). I would recommend to anyone looking to add a functional accessory to their vehicle.
4,"This book is well organized, to the point and easy to read.",VHDL made easy lives up to its name. It is a great resource for anyone new to VHDL. Its format and style make it easy to grasp the concepts and to look up information. This book is a great resource for anyone who wants to quickly learn how VHDL is used and what its capabilities are.Definitely a good way to get started and an investment worth making.
4,Perfect introduction,This book provides a perfect introduction to the field of vhdl for synthesis. Very simple and it almost cover the main topics of the language in an efficient way. The book does not provide a detailed description of the language but the level of introduction is sufficient for anyone with little or no background in VHDL.
4,Very Good Book,I wish that it would have not been written on just the left side of the page. Other than that I really enjoyed this book. I do wish it was longer so I could continue reading it!!!
3,"Alarming subject, uneven writing","This thriller is basically a warning about the dangers of genetic tinkering. In this case, a ""genetic vaccine"" which is to be inserted into corn by a virus gets out of control; the virus jumps the species barrier. People and animals who eat contaminated corn get sick, and some die from ebola. The amateurs who investigate this situation discover that the main villain is using terrorist tactics to force the American public to address the issue of genetic engineering, particularly the transfer of genetic material from one species to another. The evil one exploits unsuspecting environmentalists to support his plot and causes more than four hundred deaths.Calling attention to this problem is a worthy goal. However, the paragraphs of technical explanations will go over the heads of most readers. The two main investigators seem unbelievably reckless. While the action scenes are written effectively, the love and sex scenes are unconvincing."
5,The fasted 900 pages I ever read.,This book is master piece on how to install/implement Exchange in to your organization in a short amount of time. Even if it just basics it has remarkable detailed descriptions on every subject. In short terms very good explanations on how you should plan to build up Exchange even checklist on what questions you should consider asking if talking to a ISP. This book has it all for beginner or experts. BUY IT it's worth every penny.
5,Clear Coverage of Internet Connectivity !!,"I found the coverage in this book of Exchange and in particular coverage of using Internet Mail Service (IMS) to connect your site to internet mail to be very clear and complete. This is my second book on exchange 5.5, and it clarified many aspects of this HUGE software package and made a difficult subject approachable and pleasant to read. I successfully set up an exchange system for our (small) company with dial up internet connectivity in a short time - consequently THUMBS UP for the Authors !!"
1,THANK GOD JOEY IS DEAD,The Ramones Songbook by the Nutley Brass is just amazingly pathetic ! In Dynamic Relaxing Monophonic ! I mean I love Herb Alpert and I love a lotta lounge covers of punk songs [ AKA Richard Cheese ] and I really like the Ramones but I REALLY HATE this. Larence Welk springs to mind. Excuse me I must go wash out my mind with heavy metal played very loud now.
3,Just more pieces to pick up!,"The design and concept are very cute, but to me it's just another Mr. Potato Head with a bunch of little pieces that I have to pick up!"
5,book purchase,I was very pleased with my purchase it saved me a lot of money and it was of good quality
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps my hopes were too high, but this CD did not help my insomnia. After trying it for several nights, I began to find it annoying, especially visualizing energy coming from ""Mother Earth and Father Sun"". However, I did find the background sounds very relaxing. I would like to have had more time with just the ocean sounds, rather than hearing the man's voice throughout."
4,Jazzy,Nothing against Ms. James but we are trying to expand our musical interests. Etta James was recommended to us and we really did enjoy her voice. Don't worry we will continue to listen to this collection.
4,"Better than Coffee, Tea ,or Me. Book tells it like it is.",Having worked in the airline industry for 21 years these Flight Attendants really tell it like it is. Great stories of being on the line.
4,Good boots for a reasonable price,Good boots for a reasonable price. They dry pretty fast. The felt soles don't slip on rocks.
3,Great for Classic Lovers more than kids,"This is a great CD for kids and parents alike, as long as you like a lot of the wordless songs from the movie as well. There are not a lot of sing-a-long songs on this cd but my Little Mermaid fanatic loves it just the same. She knows the story so well she tells it along with the music as she listens. A great buy for Disney collectors, classic lovers, or true Little Mermaid fans. Others should perhaps stick to the Princess collection and other Disney compilations instead."
2,Plot to zero,I have read several of Ken Follett's books and I can't believe the horrible names he gives to women Elspeth? what is that. This is not England so one is named Elspeth in the U.S. not even in the 40's or 50's. All his perfect people were very predictable.
2,Doesn't He Have an Editor?,"The story wasn't bad, but I was appalled at all the anachronisms and mistakes. People making Xerox copies in 1958 and working for National Public Radio 15 years before it goes on the air. Most glaring is Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon in 1968, one year before it happened."
5,Page turner from the first,"If you don't have trouble putting this book down, there's a problem! It gripped me from the fly leaf! It's a good old-fashioned thriller. A man goes on a journey of self discovery because he's lost his memory while a disaster looms. I beleive the book spans only a very short period of time and yet it keeps you literally on the edge of your seat! I read the book and then listened to it on tape with my husband and I think it is equally entertaining either way."
4,An enjoyable cold war spy thriller about the space race,"At first, this seemed like a pretty typical espionage thriller and nothing too special or exciting. But as the story progressed, the more I got involved in it and enjoyed it. The space race element was intriguing, but it was the characters that really got me hooked. Through their history and relationships, which unfold to the reader as the amnesiac main character rediscovers them, Follett dramatizes how communism ultimately means the sacrifice of all one's own personal values, everything and everyone he holds most dear. This makes for high drama, conflict that is meaningful both intellectually and emotionally as these elements are united in the story. Quite well done."
3,Fast and satisfying.,"This is yet another spy thriller by Follet. It is centered this time on the 1950s space race. It is very fast to read and the plot moves along with enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested till the end. If you have read Follet before you will find his usual trademark elements of action, suspense and romance.Not his best, but great for a quiet afternoon at home or a long plane ride."
3,Disappointed,"Am big fan of Ken Follett's books. Amazes me that he can right in so many different historical periods and about so many types of subjects and people. However, ""Code to Zero"" is not up to his usual writings. Although a good ending, much of the book is a slow read and the plot does not flow as his other plots do. Clever use of Rocket launch paragraphs at beginning of each chapter and then back to the story."
5,A classic!,"If you have to work tomorrow, DO NOT start reading this book! You will not be able to put it down until the very last page. In his inimical style, Follett has produced a magnificent tale that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page. Although set in the post-Sputnik era, I quickly forgot any dated references in the excitement of the action. A ""must read""."
4,Good thriller,"Ken Follett's novel is set in the time of the Cold War. Just in time where the US and Russia start their race to explore the space.The book starts when a man wakes up in a public restroom, dressed in rags, terribly hungover and without a clue how he's got there. In the next hours he finds out that he is an important rocket scientist...but still he doesn't know how he's lost his memory. Then it comes to mind that someone made him lose his memory as he might know more than he's allowed to. With the help of some friends he finds out that he's involved into a big conspiracy, which threatens his life.Follett's book is interesting, well-written and fun to read. Nevertheless a big minus of ""Code to Zero"" are the strange coincidences that are sometimes hard to believe. Not too good is also the end that simply doesn't keep up with the high quality of the rest of the novel. But I have to say that these things are less important...""Code to Zero"" is a good book and definitely worth reading."
3,HORRIBLE narrator,"The story line is good, but the narrator is so overly melodramatic it is iritating."
3,Entertaining but...,"I've always been a huge fan of Mr. Follett's work but was a little disappointed with the last two releases. After the first good reviews of his latest effort I eagerly awaited the delivery of the novel and immediately started reading.The story is good and exciting, but the book could have been so much better if Ken Follett had just developed the characters a little deeper. The british edition clocks in at just 324 pages, at twice that amount ""Code to Zero"" could have been brilliant.Just imagine the lead character waking up without any memory of who he is - solving not only his own mystery but working out his past love life, saving the American space program and bringing the bad guys to justice - all in 300 pages (net).I would have loved a little more of this basically good story for my money. Ken Follett knows how to keep readers hooked beyond a few pages, as he's proven with blockbusters like ""Pillars of the Earth"" or ""Night Over Water"" - why not try again?"
1,Far below par...,"This latest novel shows none of the brilliance of Pillars of the Earth, none of the fascination of Dangerous Fortune, none of the history in A Place Called Freedom, none of the intrigue and sharpness found in Eye of the Needle, and none of the action in On Wings of Eagles. I can't believe it could be the same author of the aforementioned stories. Even the editors dozed as they worked: neighbourhood, but favor. Follett borrows from Trevanian when using clothing to delineate characters: Bowler and Raincoat. For those who have read this book, How did Luke have his front door key with him in Huntsville when at no time had he found his own clothes, wallet or other, and none of his friends had given him a spare key? For me, this novel reflects the problem with large advances and small expectations for popular writers. The author's grand smile on the back cover may just reflect his awareness that he has put one over on his publisher and his dedicated fans."
4,"For Pure Entertainment, It's a Great Read","If you are looking for an enlightening, educational read, get ""Galelio's Daughter"". But if you're looking for a few hours of escape, snuggled in your favorite chair, then read ""Code to Zero"". Hey - it's not rocket science, but it's fun."
3,Starts Off Strong but Suspense Not Sustained,"Without going into the details of the plot, Follet's latest thriller has an exciting beginning and has interesting and well-developed characters. Overall, Code To Zero is a fast and enjoyable ""read"". However, its suspense gradually wanes and the so-called ""surprises"" and eventual outcome become somewhat predictable. Further, you might feel that you have to suspend belief more than you are willing to in regards to the ease with which the main character: 1) discovers who he is and what he does after learning he has amnesia; and 2) uncovers the plot to sabotage the U.S.'s launching of its Explorer I satellite.Code To Zero, despite its limitations, is worth reading but I'd suggest you take it from the library. There are better books on which to plunk down $26.95."
3,Simplistic but enjoyable,"Overall, I thought Code to Zero was an enjoyable, quick read.The book moves very quickly with short chapters that make the book easy to read for those of us who can only find short blocks of time to fit in our pleasure reading.The book's major shortcoming, however, is its predictability and the ""cop-out"" solutions to the protagonist's major dilemmas. While the main character has completely lost his memory, and starts the novel with absolutely no resources, he is blessed with ""instincts"" and an awful lot of ""good luck"" that allows him to piece together the history of his life and move the story forward.I found Follett's reliance on happenstance to solve the protagonist's major problems to detract from what was otherwise an incredibly enjoyable and imaginative novel. Overall, this was a good book to read on the short train ride into work everyday."
3,She is sweet,"Here is a child with a sweet voice, but the songs seem to be alittle out of her abilities. She will only improve with age, and I wish the best for her. I think I will wait to see what she does in the future, before I purchase any more tapes..:)"
5,"Charlotte Church, Voice of an Angel","If you appreciate truly crystal clear vocals, breathtaking instrumentals, and arrangements that will genuinely move you, this is a recording you simply must experience. Charlotte Church has been blessed with a talent that some vocalists strive their entire careers to achieve. Your mouth will be agape with disbelief. Please hear this gifted young person sing. I am convinced this is the next Horizon Award winner. She is an authentic inspiration for all young people aspiring to become involved in the music industry. Her entire family is undoubtedly and deservingly beaming with pride. Thanks for allowing me to share with you. Dan Thomas"
5,Emotion,"The cristalline, angelical voice of Charlotte give me a deep, exquisite emotion. During the listening I forgot all the daily troubles. She is able to bring me over a mystical cloud in a perfect, small angle of Paradise. I sadly think to those music-ignorant primitives that dare to compare the sub-mediocre Aselin Debison and her ridicoulous, tormenting voice to this fantastic, albeit young, singer. Pity."
3,for the sake of diction Charlotte has foresaken legato work,"Good choice of numbers for Charlotte's voice. She pays a lot of attention to her diction, especially in tackling latin text, which ubfortunately tends to separate the words and spoil the exquisite legato phrases (evident in Panis Angelicus). Needs tp pay more attention to the balance of diction and legato. Will wait for her next recording before I add Charlotte to my collection."
5,Truly the voice of an angel!,This is a 13 year old child singing - how can anyone conceive that this young lady will become anything but great! She's wonderful as a person and as a singer.
2,Immature to be called a soprano.,"When I heard about Charlotte Church that she is a 13 year-old soprano with an angelic voice, I was really excited. But after I listened to her, I got really disappointed. First of all, she doesn't have an angelic voice I was looking for. I thought the voice of sopranos like Emma Kirkby and Kathleen Battle sounds more angelic and innocent than her voice. Of course Church has a voice mature to be a 13 year-old, but that does not mean that she has a mature voice and technique to be a soprano."
3,3 STARS,she has wonderful high notes but the low notes need some improvement. the last note of Pie Jesu was quite short. other than that. Great!
1,"Good voice for a 12 year old, but no good for teenagers....","Good voice for a 12 year old, but no good for teenagers, her voice could be used in ways more open to all ages."
5,My goodness this is good!,"I recently saw this young girl on one of the late night talk shows and indeed thought I had been transformed to the great beyong and was listening to the voice of an angel. Her soprano voice is lucid, quite musical and infinitely listenable. The pieces range from straight opera to modern stage to traditional folk. Her voice carries them all to new heights, and the arrangements are equally stunning. You may find that you play it from start to finish and want to hit the start button again. This is a beautiful and fun album."
5,This CD is a must have!,"While listening to this CD, I came to tears. Charlotte has the most amazing voice, and her songs are laden with emotion. I am so happy that I bought this CD and I love listening to it. Although I have to admit this isnt my type of music. I normally listen to alternative music, but after seeing Charlotte on David Letterman I couldnt resist buying this album. Days after the apperance on the Late Show, I was stuck on the song ""Pie Jesu"" I literally couldnt get it out of my head! This album is amazing! Its a must have!"
2,poorly mastered - Voice of an Angel,To me this CD was poorly mastered. Miss Church's talented voice is totally dominated by her accompaniment; further not much volume range either as I attempted to bring her out of the background fog. FGClayton
4,charlotte,"This cd was what I like to call ""mum""( I had to turn the volume all the way up to get a decent volume on it)I saw her in her first pbs concert shortly after buying this cd, and I thought her voice sounded a whole lot rounder and fuller than it does here. Oherwise I'd have to say it had really bad acoustics. She does one my favorite renditon of In Trutina. She sings light and subtle and at a brisk pace."
3,Fabulous Voice - Terrible Arrangement!,"Charlotte Church has a wonderful voice, but the recording sounded as though she were very far away in a huge hollow church. What were they thinking???? Surely a few dollars more could have been spent to make this better? I will be hesitant to buy her subsequent CDs until I get to hear them first!"
3,Beautiful Voice But Sadly Not Angelic,"This album has a great choice of songs and it is sung with obvious talent. Unfortunately the vocals would be better had it been sung to sound like who the singer is - a then 12 year old. The relentlessly constant, extreme vibrato and yawning throat makes Charlotte sound like she should have chosen different songs to put on her album. She sounds like such an opera singer that she is far removed from the innocent, childlike, ANGELIC type songs she sings.With about half her songs being renowned to be made famous by boy sopranos, her renditions show just how she could have sounded - pure, angelic, and innocent. Had it not been for her vocal training that makes her sound just the opposite."
2,"Church shows promise of developing the ""Voice of an Angel""","While I enjoyed hearing Charlotte Church's voice, when it could be heard over the accompaniment, only one song on the entire recording came close to the promise of the CD's title -- the Caccini ""Ave Maria."" The song was achingly lovely, despite Church's awkward phrasing/breathing and other technical difficulties.Every song on the disc is nice, but when heard in one sitting, the songs become monotonous, because Church simply hasn't lived long enough to know what she's singing about. There's no expressiveness or emotion in her singing yet. However, with more study and with age, she has the potential to develop the ""Voice of an Angel"" that this CD promises, but fails to deliver. I look forward to hearing future recordings."
3,Eh...,"Well... I have to say, Ms. Church, enjoy the fame while it lasts... She's not even that great of a singer. She tends to strain and ""swallow"" high notes, muffling the sound. Don't get me wrong, I love Classical music as much as I love the Beatles, and I love the Beatles to death. But even my chorus teacher critiques her as ""okay, but in another 5 years, that voice will be so worn out."" That is also said by my more intelligent Choral friends, who understand the true beauty of singing. So, Charlotte Church might be the best thing since sliced bread NOW, but give it time. Her 15 minutes are almost up."
2,Disappointing,"While she has a lovely voice, the total sound quality of the CD was poor. There was no personality, no emotion coming through in any of the selections."
3,A voice of sterile beauty that needs to season.,"Miss Church truly has a remarkable voice. I'm sure the angels in heaven rejoice over the addition to their performers' union. However, even a choir of seraphim becomes tiresome if listened to for too long. ""Pie Jesu"" was terrific, then the novelty started to wear off. By the end of ""Voice of An Angel"", the monotony of her repertoire was what stood out, not the perfection of her voice. One selection, ""Danny Boy"", brought me to tears, not because of any emotion it evoked, but because it was so sterile. Until Miss Church can season her singing from the experience gained by loving, laughing, yearning, winning, losing, mourning, and hating as an adult rather than a 12 year old, she'll serve nothing more than a niche market in the music world."
2,Experiencing baterry problem,I bought this watch last year. This is a nice looking watch. But within a year the watch stopped working. I suspect this is a battery problem.
4,Very good as far as it goes,"Eleven of the 12 songs here wonderful recordings for every collector (inclusion of the duet with Bing Crosby is a strange choice--certainly not one of Judy's finest). My quibble is that a 12-song ""millennium"" collection on a CD is just chintzy, especially when the songs are not extended play versions. Judy merits at least 15 to 20 songs for the past millennium, and the technology easily allows for putting that many on a disc."
3,LIVE SENSATIONS,I had this on cassette back in 1992.Just a really good live album and if you were into INXS you definitely didn't wanna miss on any of their albums.
5,LOVE this cleaner!,"My local Target stopped carrying this Method granite cleaner, so I was so pleased to find it here on Amazon. Like all Method products, this has a lovely, light scent -- and it's so reassuring to know that I'm using a cleaning product that is non-toxic and environmentally friendly. This leaves the granite counters in our kitchen sparkling clean and shiny. I'm so glad I stocked up on this!"
1,O STARS,"THIS IS JUNK NOT MUSIC.NEON MOON IS THE WORST SONG EVER!IT IS SO BORING AND DULL.AND A COOL DRINK OF WATER IS A HORRIBLY WRITTEN AND SUNG SONG!THIS MUSIC BORES ME!LEAVE IT ALONE AND STICK TO RAP,ROCK,OR METAL.COUNTRY SUCKS!"
3,Needs to grow up a bit,"He can sing and i gotta give him credit for that. But since he is only 10 or 11 years old, he has a high pitched voice and it gets annoying. But I'd definitely buy his CD when he recorded one after his voice gets lower"
1,"propaganda ""music"", zero star, pass it","I thought since I didn't understand chinese I could still enjoy the music of the famed chinese opera. I was wrong. The ambiance is obviously propaganda which irritates, provokes, and hints at violence (sounds like some current trends of western music which I don't listen to either). There isn't a trace of any of the beautiful chinese operatic tunes. Don't buy it."
1,DISAPPOINTED!,"This is a GREAT book! Having received one from a dear friend a number of years ago and totally enjoying it, I wanted to bless a few other dear friends with copies as well. To my huge disappointment, the two copies I initially ordered arrived damaged. I returned those, and the replacement copies were also damaged. Those were also returned. Guess that's why the ""low price""...... I had to order from another source. First time I've been disappointed with the quality of products from Amazon.com."
4,Masterful,"Just because the usual characters aren't here, don't pass this one by. History, colorful characterizations and plenty of action, together with Burke's skillful language, make this a must read. The author maintains his reputation as one of our finest writers."
4,Burke - forever the master of words,"I listed to this book on audio cassette. The narrator, Ed Sala is a master of many voices. His voice alone makes the book worth listening to. And of course, James Lee Burke is a master of words and a master of creating a plot and story line that is intriguing and suspenseful.A wonderful and power book to listen to that brings many aspects of the Civil War and how it effecter ordinary people."
4,Further democratisation,"This book brings a collection of various essays on the debate of democracy. Here the various contributors share the view that a progression is needed from liberal democracy, but without destroying its already mechanisms. Notion of citizenship and community are taken as the centre of debate. Edited by Chantal Mouffe, who also provides a contribution, the book can be a standard text for those interested in contemporary debate of democracy and its further possibilities."
1,boring!,"I was assigned this book for my ESL endorsement class. It is very dull, and if I didn't need to read this for class I would never have made it past the first few pages. The anecdotes are dry, uninformative and not helpful in real-world situations. Professors, please skip this selection and save your students!"
5,Lots of information in a short book,"Mr. Sloane teaches in succinct diagrams and text. His information opened my eyes to see the changes in color as clouds move farther away. Additionally, he includes valuable instruction about composing skies to support a landscape."
5,Thought Provoking,"This book is written primarily for academics. Wenger challenges educational institutions to re-think their basic assumptions about learning (e.g., its social aspects, its relationship to practice, and the role of teaching).I found the book to be very thought provoking, but I would recommend his 2002 book, ""Cultivating Communities of Practice,"" for practitioners.Michael BeitlerAuthor of ""Strategic Organizational Learning"""
4,"Good, but not wonderful","It is a very interesting book, I just wish that it had more important roadside whimsies in it. Ilike it though."
2,Flimsy earings.,"I just received those earrings and was very disappointed. They're a lot lighter than I thought, the clasp doesn't close very well and the frame is very thin.I will probably be returning these!"
2,"Good for kids, teens and eager star wars fans hands off!","First of all, this CD is clearly for kids. Especially the 2 - 7 year olds will enjoy the read along - style of the hughly coloured book accompanying the cd. Those who expect a high tech soundeffect - adventure will be greatly dissapointed - not only that the use of soundeffects and original dialog is very limited, unfortunately the old music from the elder movies was used...although the new score was already availabe. Nevertheless the quite complex story is vivdly told and any scary, for children unsuitable elements like violence and too dark descriptions of evil characters are left out. A little more atmosphere would have done alot to improve the overall experience! Good for kids, teenies and eager star wars fans - hands off! Get the audio book from EPISODE I - UNABRIDGED instead!"
1,Can I take back that star?,"This is the worst! 99% narration and all of that bad. I used to listen to my Star Wars story LP over and over (which is why, unfortunately, I can still tell you that Luke and the crew were trapped in trash compactor 3263827) and it was great. A narrator was used sparringly to make transitions and all the dialog and music was straight from the movie, this is completely opposite. Now I know the Lucas marketing strategy is to drip out products like frozen molassas over the next hundred and fifty years, but this, like JAR JAR, was just bad thinking. If you're looking for a read along book, okay here's a really bad one, go nuts. But if you want the MOVIE on a CD that your children can listen to without nodding off thanks to a voice-over guy getting paid scale (at least that's what he's worth -- the editors and writers of the book too) pass on this."
3,Really Oval,"This skillet is really oval. Really. As another reviewer wrote, find the dimensions and see if it will work on your stove top. It seems like its top ""Le Creuset"" quality - just a funny shape. Side by side burners would work the best."
5,What really happened to Gerd Ludemann,"This volume is a condensed and somewhat more easily readable version of the case Ludemann presents in _The Resurrection of Jesus_, now apparently not in print. In each volume, he argues on textual grounds that the resurrection of Jesus was in fact not a literally historical event. Readers should be aware that as of his most recent book -- _The Great Deception: What Jesus Really Said and Did_ -- Ludemann, with admirable intellectual honesty, has declared himself to be no longer affiliated with Christianity. Nor will anyone who reads this book have any trouble seeing why. Indeed, the question will be why people who share Ludemann's beliefs continue to remain within the fold."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I wasn't expecting anything too fancy; just something I can fit my laptop in. It's definitely spacious enough for just about anything. The only problem is that the strap is way too short, so if you have to overload it with a bunch of heavy stuff, you're going to be hurting. Also, some of the stitching was a bit loose."
2,Novice beware!,"This book contributes virtually nothing new to this field - its contents are covered, and covered with greater accuracy and authority, in the books of Michel de Trez, John Andrews, and Gary Howard. Novice collectors of the artifacts of U.S. airborne forces will be especially ill-served by this book if they use it as an authoritative guide because of the author's indiscriminate use of replicas, more than a few of which are of poor quality. There are better books on this subject; do yourself a favor and seek them."
5,More Than I Expected!,I didn't realize that this two-disc anthology was this good -- it took me way back and even had some of the songs that I was hoping it had ...... and it did!
4,The one minute father,"It is a good book, useful in a lot of cases. It does not teach you to be a good father, but hepls you to understand in a better way the always complex relations with your children."
4,Enjoyed,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have read many of Patterson's novels, and I'd rate this right up there with the rest."
2,TX. Lady,This one is just not up to Patterson's Alex Cross books. Wasn't believable. In fact it was so boring I couldn't even finish it. Hope the next one is better. It has to be be cause IMHO it couldn't get much worse.
2,disappointed in Patterson,"An avid fan since the beginning, I was disappointed in Four Blind Mice. First, the death penalty nonsense. In N.J., it's been years since they executed anyone. Patterson does it in weeks. I haven't seen this kind of silly stereotyping of crazy Vietnam vets since the seventies. I'm very familiar with Bayhead, and I doubt this army widow could ever afford a beach house with a view. Patterson couldn't even decide if the victims were innocent or guilty. I would think with so many bodies some police, military or civilian would be interested. It's a shame Patterson has gone so overboard with Alex Cross that he's setting up politically correct uncaring white establishment types as villains. I was particularly pained by ""the hippy white girl "" who spit on Samson as a returning vet."
1,A turgid mess,"This book was boring, completely unbelievable, poorly written, and terribly plotted. Other than that I really didn't like it. The characters were cardboard cut-outs-especially the bad guys. The ""love scenes"" were painful- I don't care how Jam's lips taste one time, let alone 3 or 4 times. The climactic shoot-out was SO predictable I laughed. The gratuitous violence against women in this book makes one wonder ... Yes it's a murder mystery and people die in thrillers but wholesale slaughter of 3 housewives, 4 prostitutes in a brothel, not to mention what happens to them before they are killed-was sick and, more importantly, added nothing to the narrative. Wish I'd been the fifth blind mouse so I couldn't have read this."
2,Disappointing,"James Patterson is still the best writer in the business, but this time out is not worthy of him. It's okay and if you like the Alex Cross series you must read it, but it's just not up to the high standards of the first Cross books. Since Patricia Cornwell has forgotton how to write, and Patterson is losing his touch; who's left. Iris Johansen?"
2,overly contrived plot & twists,"I'll read this author for a quick, cheap escape -- something good if one is locked up or needs an easily accessible, cheap read to pass the time for 30-mins or so...maybe a few hours, even. I won't fault you if you microwave some buttered popcorn and pop open a brew and read this book...But, I care little for this author's books on a deeper level. The plots and the twists & turns he uses come across to me as overly contrived and this is a big turn-off for me. When a plot development is written in order to create a bigger 'twist' at the sacrifice of naturalness and realness, this is badddddddd. For me, anyway.As soap operas have their place, so do these books, including 4 blind mice."
4,great,this is one of my favorite james patterson books. action from beginning to end and still he gives his characters a human aspect.
2,Four Blind Mice (James Patterson),"As many reviewers have indicated, this book is not nearly as good as Patterson's earlier works. Is it possible Patterson now employs a ghost writer?For people who enjoy thrillers, his first few books are fun. Don't bother with recent ones, though."
3,not bad but not really good either..........,"i finished this book some days ago, now i dont even remember the story of the book.........cant even remember who the 4th mice was.........i mean Patterson books are definitely not Thought Provoking.....it doesnot even stick around your head for long.........but none the less its a fast read and its a momentary fun.........i just finished the big bad wolf....was as good as this book..........all in all James Patterson still does his trick and makes an enjoyable Read but its time he put more substance and more suspense to his book.......bring the THRILL back!!!!!!!"
2,Hit team--Poorly developed,"This is an incredibly poorly written book with each character's persona is not as fully developed as it could have been. Its a quick read at the beach type of book. This is a shame because the idea is good but the author skims the surface the the three main bad guys' personas, adds unnecessary violence where non-violence would have worked so much better. Too bad."
4,Detective Alex Cross does not disappoint,"This is a perfect James Patterson murder mystery book with my favorite Detective Alex Cross. It's a quick, easy read, with lots of action. The murders are more brutal than some of Patterson's books. At least they catch the bad guys at the end so the conclustion was more satisfying than some of Patterson's latest books which continue. The background was set in the Vietnam war and the military setting. Cross sets out to save a man on death row accused of murders. There are some repeat characters so I would not recommend starting with this book if you are not familiar with the Cross series. If you love the Alex Cross series, Four Blind Mice will not disappoint you - there are several unpredictable twists!"
3,I missed the suspense,"You don't expect a lot of depth with James Patterson and his very short chapters but I sure did not get the suspense that all of these other reviewers did. I liked the storyline with Sampson who is an intriguing character but Cross's romance with Jamala was trite and the character continues to be totally unrealistic. He can just kill people and then attend a wedding, sorry I don't get it. He is suppose to be a psychologist and there is no depth to his character or insight into why he does these stupid and dangerous things. It is an average book and I wish I had waited for the paperback."
2,Following Alex Cross's Career,"having read all the Alex Cross mysteries from Along Came A Spider to Four Blind Mice, i'm realizing something...Cross's career climaxed at Roses Are Red. The following books really havent done much for me. I picked up Four Blind Mice upon its November release date and here it is mid-January and i'm just now finishing it. it was a painful read because i couldnt get into it. the short chapters have never been a problem, its the lack of character-depth, lack of mystery, the graphic description of the senseless murders--especially to the women, and once the big mystery was revealed it was like: okay...and? I thought nothing in this series would be worse than Violets Are Blue. At this point, I cant tell if ""4 Blind Mice"" is the title or author!"
1,Time Line Ruins Book For Me,"Can anyone get by the time line in this Book. A Sgt. That Sampson served with in Vietnam is on death row. But wait. Sampson and Alex Cross are in their ""early 40s"" according to the chapter with the softball game. The book is set in at least 2002, as Sept 11 is mentioned. So if we stretch ""early 40s"" to be 45, then Alex and Sampson are born in 1957, U.S. pulls out of Vietnam in early 1973 when Sampson and Alex are 16 years old, too young to legitimately sign up for the US Army (Which Sampson points out that Nana helped him do).If you're going to write a formulaic ""Bad US Military people prey on innocents"" book, at least respect my abiltity to add and subtract."
3,Another one of those Yikey gory things......,"I read this one after Beach House by the same author. I now have come to the conclusion that the author is perhaps a little weird! I mean, he just seems to write only horrifying stuff--- that too, sickeningly horrifying, if-you-know-what-I-mean! If you are like me and do not really enjoy gory stuff, then puuhleaze, do not even think of getting this one. It made me want to throw up. Book to be read once and kept away, I feel."
3,I s Patterson slipping?,"I have read almost all of Patterson's books, and while I liked this book, it did not live up to his other ones. There was so much blank space in the book. Note how many pages or parts of pages are empty. Those blank spaces could have been used to describe how the killers used DNA to frame the wrong people or to develop the characters a little. His plot was great, but it was like he just ""mailed this one in"". I hope his next one is better."
2,What's happening to Mr. Patterson?,"I very much enjoyed his women's club murder series and picked up his latest, just a little something to tie me over until the third in the series was released. This was my first Alex Cross novel and regretted that this had to the be first. The plot seemed rather unorganized and the ending was not plausible. I know that Mr. Patterson releases books frequently... maybe, he shouldn't. It is the quality that readers are concerned with after all."
5,Good book,"This book is an interesting true story written by a good writer, M. William Phelps. It is well written and I would recommend it."
1,Not satisfied with the product,The bracelet I purchased is quite old and few marks on it. So totally not upto what was shown.
2,"Series starts strong, tails off quickly","The first four episodes of this series are tremendous. It's too bad, in retrospect, that they are the outliers in one of the most frustrating tv viewing experiences I've had recently. This series not only doesn't live up to its early promise, it aggressively taunts the viewer for ever investing any interest in the events it depicts. I can admire an ambitious, well-intentioned creative failure. The producer of this series was not well intentioned nor terribly ambitious. Avoid."
1,Pointlessly meandering and hopelessly contrived situations,"I love well-written television. This is not it. Even though murder investigations are not all likely to proceed in orderly fashion, the writers here create freakishly complex meanderings and blind alleys that feel hopelessly contrived. This show attempts to portray a gritty ultra-realism, which is appreciated, but when they throw in an FBI sting situation worthy of NCIS, the writing destroys the atmospheric credibility."
2,A show about the worst detectives ever and a director that hates the audience,"Want to waste approximately 10 hours or so of your life? Then this is the show for you. After a promising start (the first two to three episodes were quite good), enjoy as each week the terrible writers insert a red herring at the end of each episode. Thrill as the director strives to make you care about none of the characters. Watch in amazement as, towards the end, the detectives discover things that even basic police work would have uncovered in the first couple of episodes.This is one of the worst TV shows I've ever watched. None of the folks that I know who watched season 1 (grudgingly, towards the end, only to find out the killer) won't be around for season 2."
1,Are these the worst TV police detectives ever?,"I really had high hopes for this. Who knows? Maybe the Danish original version they based this on is okay, but I don't think I'll test the waters on that. No real crime-solving or detecting here. Just grief, grief, grief, tears tears and bad moods. The female lead detective is supposed to be moving at any second from Seattle to, uh, I think Oakland... and why is this interesting to us? She keeps missing flights and having uncomfortable conversations with her nine year old son that go nowhere.Just awful. There's a political subplot that is as fascinating as all behind-the-scenes political insider stories are -- in other words, it's as fascinating as watching paint dry.I'm boring myself writing about this thing."
2,Cheaters!,"I won't ""spoil"" the series for anyone who hasn't watched, but it promised a lot, and delivered only a little. Very disappointed. It's going to take a lot for me to watch next season, especially if I have to pay for some of the episodes."
5,Great Series !!!!!,I started watching this series during the beginning of the second season. It was so good I had to purchase the first season which is just as good. The seller shipped very quick.
1,Watch Forbrydelsen instead,"This was not an ""AMC original"" even though they call it one. It was copied from Forbrydelsen, which is a Danish show, and the original was not only much better but this AMC version doesn't reveal who killed Rosie. Every poster and ad for the show asks ""Who killed Rosie Larsen?"" but then AMC never reveals who killed her. Good job, I think I'll pass. Why did I waste my time?"
2,Not so Good,"This is the first of all the Method products that I will not buy again. Though the wash smelled good, it did not even remove the easiest debris particles from the dishes. I hate to think what's left in the way of germs. Yuck! I will keep all my other method produts but switch back to Cascade for the dishes."
1,Only for under 1600 of rating,"The name of ""Grandmaster techniques"" is only marketing publicity. There aren't deep explanations. For example in the Nimzo-indian said that you need to close the game in order to manage your knights. Every opening book says that. I really hoped much more. But this book is very good for persons who don't have other chess books."
2,Too Brief,"This book covers almost every single ascept of a chess game in under 350 pages. One would expect that it would not explain the material very well, and he would be absolutely right. This book is only good as a reference book, and is a terrible ""teaching book."""
3,"OK, but could be better","In theory, this is a great little product to protect the telephone systems inside the house. Channel vision could improve the product immensely if they decided to make two changes to the product: 1) Document whether the jack is wired for USOC, T568A, T568B wiring standards. 2) Add a second jack (on the incoming side) to allow customers to bypass the 110 punchdown block if they want to."
3,"Good exercise routines, poor audio content","The exercises are very good for us oldies: gentle and not too fast or too jarring. I rapidly got sick of the music and her repetitious commentary (""Moving free!""). I now use it with the sound off."
3,not recommended,I had really hoped this book would be more dynamic....IF it weren't for te fact that it crossed several oceans to reach me I would ave returned it..
2,Don't Waste Your MONEY!!!!!,"The title is an attention getter; don't waste your money. I rented this for $3.99, I'm glad that I did not purchase it as I initially intended. It really wasn't worth $3.99 but it really isn't worth $14.99 or more."
3,i like most of it but.......,"The opening part was weak but the 2nd story needs to be made into a movie by itself. Helena is on some other level and would love to see her in a full feature. Like the reviewer said earlier, the soundtrack is excellent. it really sets the mood for some scenes. Just a heads up about the soundtrack as well. It's solid but the song that is in tonite part 1 where the lady with the braids is in the car with the baby and the accountant is NOT on the soundtrack. I don't know if this is an oversite or they just didn't have the license to put this on the soundtrack. a real minus"
5,EXCELLANT COOKBOOK,"I used to live in Denver, and I bought this cookbook for myself, as well as for family and friends. My original cookbook fell apart, so I ordered a new one. Needless to say, I Love this cookbook. Thank you. Karen Gould Stuart, Florida"
1,non-functioning!,"The battery did not work on arrival, the links for returning both required that I return it and told me it could not be returned. Calling Amazon customer service fixed this and got me a prompt credit as there were NO replacement batteries available. I got a working one from a different vendor so my little mowbot is humming along on its own again."
5,I've taught using this book,"This is a nice collection for the 21st century, including lots of new voices while still maintaining enough of the canon for a good survey course. It's a big, heavy book (for a paperback) that might have been easier to read in two volumes, but as far as content goes, this one has Norton's beat by miles."
3,I Ain't Mad Atcha....BUT!,"These guys give a great show live! I've heard all of the songs on this disc in a concert setting and, hard as it may be to believe (no thanks to the ""radio-friendliness"" of this CD), these guys really can play jazz!!!We can only hope that as the Braxton Brothers continue to grow, they will get more say in how to present their music. Some ""smooth jazz"" gets too syrupy for it's own good."
3,Just another contemporary jazz album,"I expected more from the brothers with the new album. But, it is just another contemporary jazz album. It is not a bad album. It is just not musically sophisticated."
2,Wouldn't to visit these places too often,"Maybe Saint Etienne is working too hard. If you're expecting six solid pop songs, you'll be disappointed. It's more like four mediocre pop songs and two one-minute bits of fluff. ""52 Pilot"" was released as a single on 12"" vinyl complete with a b-side. Why? It is nowhere near single material. The band attempts to rescue the rest of the album's lack of structure with the stale ""We're In The City,"" which no doubt will end the career of mixmaster The Trouser Enthusiast. ""Artieripp"" was probably meant to be a b-side for a single never released from Good Humor. ""Half Timbered"" hints at something lovely, but abruptly ends before it gets started. All in all, these places to visit are pretty boring."
2,For fans only.,"A major disappointment. Most of the tracks are basically dull-but-not-unpleasant instrumental excursions. Particularly loathsome is ""We're in the City,"" which not only has some of the most inane lyrics I've ever heard in a St. Etienne song, but that most tired of dance music cliches: the 909 beat, complete with hi-hat and handclap. ""Sadie's Anniversary,"" on the other hand, is passable, but still nothing spectacular. For fans (like me), I guess it's worth your seven dollars, but otherwise stay away."
3,What was the point?,"St. Etienne have been around for almost 9 years now. Many fans such as myself have seen their music evolve from their rather GLORIOUS debut Foxbase Alpha, to, what I like to think as the best thought out pop record of the late '90s, ""Good Humour."" Why they thought the need to release this 7 track ep is somewhat a mystery to me. As they took two steps forward with their latest LP, they took two back with this EP. The songs are definitly worth a listen, some you may enjoy, but they certainly are expendable. Alas, St. Etienne is a fave, so I dare not give them less then 3 stars!!"
5,Inspiration is Step One: Adam's Book is Superb,"Readers looking for a ""how-to"" of activism need to check out THE FUTURE IS OURS (John W. Bartlett, Ed.), to which Adam contributed a chapter, instead of harping on Adam's book for not providing one. ACT FIRST, APOLOGIZE LATER offers young readers what they need before seeking out the ""how-to"" -- inspirational success stories, a window into the grueling fun of Adam's own experiences as an activist, and some foundational principles for activism and life -- in an accessible and conversational tone. Simply put, Adam's book gives readers a sense of possibility for themselves and the world. Because it does that, it is invaluable."
1,WTF?,"This is the first book in my 50+ years of life that I have not been able to finish. It just rambles on. Maybe if I knew more about Jakson Pollack it would have been more interesting, but I doubt it."
3,Price was right,"With delivery this was less than the local office supply stores. The only drawback is that the box has an expiration of June 2010. Fortunately, I needed to use it right away; no issues yet. Just a little disappointed that the product had been sitting so long."
3,It came loose,"I love sunglasses! But I had to take a trip to my optometrist or sunglass store to have it adjusted. It came loose and doesn't sit right on my face. Like other sunglasses, it should be tried on, to see how it sits on your face, given the fact that people has different facial shapes and one thing to take into consideration when buying products like this is how it complements ones facial size and shape."
4,Lego Star Wars Set,"Grandson loved it. In fact, both grandsons love Lego Star War figures. Just think they over-priced but they do last for a long, long time and I'm happy it keeps them off the boob tube."
3,Latter Day Genesis:,"We can't dance features Phil Collins as the leader of Genesis. This album is probably the most stripped down album they recorded. Before, synth overpowered the rhythmn section. Now there are more hints of actual guitar and the drums sound more crisp than they have in a while. This approach is a great idea except the album is inconsistent. The first 5 tracks convinced me at first that this was one of their better albums. After that the second half falls off with the exception of Hold on My Heart. I think they tried to be more progressive on the second half but it comes out boring and too long. With Drive the Last Spike the song is too long but it is meant to be long. Besides it is worth for the bobasting climax. The guitars layer and Phil's voice is full of passion, impossible to not try to sing along. It is a pretty good album but not their best."
5,A good farewell to Phil era. Excelent album!,"This is, in my opinion, the second best album from Genesis pop era. It have really good and catchy pop tunes, like the excelent ""No Son Of Mine"", the great ""Jesus He Knows Me"" the awesome ""I Can't Dance"" the beautiful ""Never A Time"", the good ""Tell Me Why"" the great ""Living Forever"", the soulfull and beautiful ""Hold On My Heart"", the grooving ""Way Of The World"" and the lovely ""Since I lost You"". There are also tracks in where the band proves that the old school Genesis from Gabriel and Hacket era still lives, like the great ""Driving The Last Spike"", the bluesy ""Dreaming While You Sleep"" and the introspective ""Fading Lights"", of course, mixing the actual pop style of the band, but really good and with powerfull and nice tunes on it. Anyway, it's a great album that I think you should add to your collection, if you like good music!"
1,The end of the real Genesis,"I bought this CD as soon as it was available in 1991 while I was stationed in korea, (so it had allready benn out for a couple of months). I was not impressed the only two songs I cared for were Dreaming while you sleep and driving the last spike since they had hints of the old Genesis. The problem I had was this albumn became more of a Phil Collins solo albumn then a Genesis albumn (although his first two solo albumns were masterpeices). I am not one the fans that bashes threm for Invisible touch I liked that one, though not my favorite, it still had the rock sound to it. After this albumn came out I knew Genesis would cease to exist anymore. If you are into the new Phill Collins then this is an albumn for you but, I wouldnt buy it except for the fact that I collect everything they ever put out. I rank this albumn with From Genesis to Revelation (they were young and trying to make hits that sounded like everyone else from that era)."
2,There is only one reason this is in my CD collection,"Okay...I have to say, the first time I ever heard of Genesis was ""That's All"" and ""Illegal Alien"".Even when Phil Collins ""No Jacket Required"" became such a monster hit in the mid 80's along with ""Invisible Touch"", I wasn't a big fan, I just liked the music.It was when I bought albums like ""Genesis"", ""Duke"" and even ""Abacab"" that I had realized that this band had an incredible sound.So when ""We Can't Dance"" came out, I was excited due to the song ""No Son of Mine"", but was really let down by songs like ""I can't Dance"", that stupid song about evangilists. But the only reason I have this CD in my collection is the song ""Driving The Last Spike"".This song is a very incredible song that moves me evertime I hear it.It is a song that will be lost in an album full of nothing. It is too bad that it is on such horrible album that basicly sounds like a Phil Collins solo album being played by Mike and the Mechanics."
2,Boring.Collins on his way out.,This record sounds like the record label deadline was approaching and the band had to come up with something-it is totally circumstantial and repetitive without even the pop touches of 1986's'Invisible Touch'.Most of the material here sounds forced and contrived revealing a band that was already on the life support of their reputation.
2,Fading history.....,"It's not hard to see why the boys put 'Fading Lights' as the last track of the album. It's like Queen did with 'The show Must Go On' on Innuendo. It is their coda. If only they could have put as much into the rest of the album, it would have been their best post-Gabriel. The first half is tolerable. The second half is saved only by 'Living Forever' and ""Fading Lights', possibly one of their best collaberative songs. It seems the rest of the songs were left overs from Phils divorce days or they wouldn't fit on his 'But Seriously...' Don't get me wrong. I am a HUUUUGE Genesis fan. The first time I heard 'I Can't Dance', I had never been so excited about a Genesis release. Maybe as time goes by, I will learn to appreciate this album more. But I just can't seem to help myself from using that auto-select button on my cd player."
4,Some good information in this book...,"Like the person before me I think Sharp Sports Betting is better for the beginning bettor. This is a pretty thick book which might make you think there is a lot about how to handicap your own games but there really is very little on that subject. The book deals mostly with defining types of bets and only really addresses football specifically. However, the reason I gave this 4 stars is because I liked the mathematical approach to prop bets. It gives you a really good way to figure out if they are worth betting on depending on the payouts by the sportsbook. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, the charts at the end were interesting and gives you a few good angles to bet on football. I would have liked to have seen more on handicapping though and less defining of terms and bets. Overall though, Sharp Sports Betting is a pretty good book. The information is current and also addresses things like internet betting, while providing some interesting websites."
2,disappointed,"The product information stated there was a website to follow the program and get help. However, the website is not available anymore. I joined Weight Watchers online instead."
3,okay but breaks easy,cool toy but fragile it feel off the stand and broke (nothing a little clue couldn't fix) withing the first month. I still think it's a good item for the price though.
2,Where are the women?!,"My 3yo loves this puzzle an it's great fun, but why is there not a single woman or girl to be found in the picture? There's male firefighters, a drowning man, a dad and his son on the street watching the scene, a helicopter pilot, but no women??!!! How disappointing.When I asked my son, he replied: ""Maybe they are working at the fire station, mommy."" Smart kid."
4,An Excellent Debut,"While Tracy Lawrence went on to do better things with albums such as ""Alibis"" and ""Lessons Learned,"" you can't deny that his debut album, ""Sticks and Stones,"" is one of the best albums from the early 90's. From high energy twangers to slow drinkin' songs, Lawrence covers a wide array of stylings with this album. The title track shines best, but songs like ""Runnin' Behind"" and ""Paris, Tennessee"" remind the listener that some of the best country tunes are the ones that aren't too terribly serious. ""Today's Lonely Fool"" and ""Somebody Paints The Wall"" head up the more serious songs on this album, but Lawrence has a tone in his voice letting you know that no matter how bad things are going, there's always a honky-tonk with an open barstool nearby.For good 90's country before it was commercialized to death and turned into pop with a fiddle in it, check out Tracy Lawrence's ""Sticks and Stones."" His other albums are just as good or better also."
5,Today's Lonely Fool.,"Tracy Brings Out The Goods Of Country Music. Sure He Can Sing Like George Strait. He Says That He Is Alone On The Midtemple Ballad ""Today's Lonely Fool"". The Upbeat ""Runnin' Behind"" Can Make You Get Up And Dance. The Title Track Was Also A Dance Ballad Too And It Became His First Number 1 Hit."
1,Extremely Unhealthy,"This diet plan basically asks a woman to exercise for 1.5 hours a day, and live on what amounts to 700 or so calories. It's kind of unbelievable that this diet is making the rounds and being promoted by people like Gwyneth Paltrow, who herself has recently received a diagnosis of early-onset bone disease (one suspects at least partially due to the lack of nutrients from years of extreme dieting). Check out a more reasonable approach that is based on a healthy diet and exercise."
1,Lasted less than 6 months,"Yes, it's' dusty here, and there is a lot of silica in the dust. But most wiper blades I have bought last about a year. I just replaced these after 6 months because they were so streaky already."
3,"You Haven't Struck a Gold Masterpiece. Still, a Good Read",Whilst Bullion is not Pattinson's greatest book it is still a good worthwhile simple read. Struggling to make ends meet with a wife who recently left him Alan Caley receives a call from a childhood friend recently out of jail. Not really liking him but persuaded to have lunch by the offer of it being worthwhile for himself Caley reluctantly accepts. A trip to the toilet after being given an unopen letter to look after has Caley witness the back of his exfriend's head blown away by a couple of thugs. Now the police are interested in him as are the thugs and they all suspect Caley knows where the stolen gold bullion is buried. He doesn't of course but he does have the contents of the envelope to help him find it.
3,Buddha Bank - Happiness,"Item is great design and color, but I would make one major change. The coin slot is located at the rear bottom of the Buddha's neck, making it very difficult to fill the bank more than halfway."
5,More great Power Pop from an undersung musical genius,"On his three solo albums -- this one, ""Set to Pop,"" and ""Feeling the Elephant"" -- as well as on his country records (where he was half of the duo Foster & Lloyd), Bill Lloyd crafts delectable pop that's both rootsy and clever, catchy and poetic.He references other pop giants, but usually more through mood and tone than through explicit quoting. But even if you're not as well-versed as Lloyd in pop lore, you'll still find his music fun and addictive.Viva Bill Lloyd! Buy this record!"
1,Bad VPN Router,"This router is good for anything but VPN. I know that sounds a bit harsh, but after wasting significant time and getting no support from Sofaware I find the device is almost useless to access shared resources behind firewall. I am not a beginner and I have done my share VPN setups including other products from Checkpoint. The only thing that works and pretty stable is Remote Desktop over VPN. I tried office mode, setup port rules, etc. I upgraded the firmware, tried the latest Secure Client, I still get the MTU Status as failed (peer too old) error and can't reach any shared resource behind the VPN from Internet. I can only ping. I will try a Cisco."
5,"Great Knife, Great Value","I love this knife! I have other, more expensive Henckles knives, and thie one easily holds it's own. This is a great knife with a great feel.The ergonomic handle add for a great grip."
5,Gotta have this,"Not a huge fan of today's rap and r&b, but do have a huge soft spot for some of the old school rap, like Run DMC and the Beastie Boy's. I will select this on my ipod when I start a 3-4 mile run. Starts out with ""so what'cha want, and rocks all the way to the end with ""fight for your right"". Solid Gold Hits is a must have for all hip hop-rap listeners."
3,A Good Book For Background Information...,"If you're looking for a book filled with color pictures and image ideas for your next tattoo, then you may want to consider looking elsewhere. However, if you want to get more of a historical background on the various images and symbols used in tattoo art throughout the ages then you won't be disappointed. The ""Tattoo Encyclopedia"" is an interesting catalog of all the world images, symbols and designs used in tattoo art throughout the centuries. While most of the entries are just a few sentences long, it gives facinating trivia on a wide variety of images from Chinese Dragons to the Illuminati to the Claddagh to the Triskelion. It would have been nice to have pictures accompanying all the entries but I guess that would be asking a bit too much. Useful strictly as a reference book and not as a book on design, the ""Tattoo Encyclopedia"" is a good buy for those curious about the origins and meanings of tattoo symbols."
4,"Informative, Wish it was Larger!","This is a great book for anyone looking to get a tattoo. It covers all the basics of symbolism of major images and themes seen in tattoos. It has a lot of entries, but I wish there was more in-depth entries! At least they give a good over-view of each entry so you could look up more about it on your own. Not as many pictures as I would like - but its an inexpensive book so really I can't complain!"
3,pictures!pictures!pictures!,"Book was informative,but,I think people need to see more pictures of the designs when they are choosing a tatoo."
2,not too much info,there is not much to this book a few pictures and mild reading rather informative yet not as much help as popup books would have been.
2,If you are considering for public library purchase,"There are no photographs in this book. There are black and white drawings illustrating SOME of the ideas in this book.This book is really about the MEANINGS of various images. As an example, under MOOSE it talks about where they live, the fact that moose are strong swimmers, talks about antlers. I suppose the point is letting a person know the background to what they are getting. Not the first place I would look for this type of info.My patrons want lots of colors photos. This book does not get a lot of use."
2,tattoo symbolism,"This book lacks in every aspect from military tattoos to naval tattos through tribal and traditional up to modern symbles that may appear of any importance.I had high hopes of this book but sadly I was dissepointed...The sadest thing of all is that there isn't even an attempt from the author of the book to learn more from the readers of the book... No contact address is present so that in the future an updated edition would be published.In short, good way to make money, bad way to create an academic research...Choosing a tattoo buy way of using this book? I don't think so."
5,"Love him, love his voice...","There is a very good reason why once turned on to Michael Crawford, us MC fans love him forever. When you listed to this CD, you'll join the club, too.The voice of an angel that only gets better with time."
2,Expectations Unfulfilled,"Lost Discoveries : The Ancient Roots of Modern Science--from the Babylonians to the Maya by Dick Teresi is a book that probably shouldn't have been written. I just don't have a lot of good things to say about it. Based on the premise I had high expectations that the book would investigate the technologies of ancient civilizations for things that we, today, don't understand or can't duplicate. I thought I'd get an examination into the pyramids, Mayan building techniques, and perhaps Pacific Island navigation methods. What I got instead was a lot of unsubstantiated speculation and loosely strung hypothesis. Teresi also filled his book with indigenous mythology cribbed right from Joseph Campbell's mythology books. Unfortunately I read Campbell's library and it's much more interesting in the unabridged version.The worst thing I can say about a nonfiction book is that I didn't learn anything new from it. That's the truth of this volume.- CV Rick, May 2008"
1,Lost Opportunities,"The author had an opportunity to present achievements of non-western civilizations and missed it. The book is full of inaccuracies. For example on page 44 the author confuses Ahmes papyrus (also known as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus) with the Mathematical Leather Roll. If you do not already know the subject, you may end up with incorrect information. It is best to avoid this book."
1,Poorly Written and Full of Inaccuracies,"I bought this book because I liked its premise. However, I was thoroughly disappointed before I could even finish the first chapter. The book is filled with repetitious statements on the one hand and inconsistancies on the other. If you can get over the poor writing style, you will come up against the flagrant factual errors. For example, Teresi denegrates the Greeks for thinking the world is flat. Huh? Most of the greatest Greek philosophers, including Pythagoras and Ptolemy, thought Earth was a sphere. Aristotle even used the evidence that Earth casts a round shadow on the moon during an eclipse to support this idea.This was just one of many factual errors that popped out at me while I tried to read this poorly executed book. As an archaeologist myself, I couldn't agree more that non-Westerners have made great contributions to science. However, believe it or not, so have Westerners!"
2,Okay but...,"As a reminder that inventiveness and creativity are not the sole property of the West this book is helpful. But as an argument that modern science somehow has its roots outside the West it is quite mistaken. While one can tolerate Teresi's often indiscriminate accumulation of history, myth, and legend - odd in a book devoted to science - his identification of invention with a scientific world view incorporating predictive theory and experiement is catastrophic. As e.g. Rodney Stark, FOR THE GLORY OF GOD, and others have shown, the modern scientific worldview is peculiarly Western and emerged out of the Scholastic (and horror of horrors) Christian worldview of the high middle ages. This is precisely why it was the West, and only the West, that modernized."
4,Motivation for Entrepreneurs,"Nancy Koehn's Brand New inspires the entrepreneur in us all. Her book gives readers a greater appreciation for the risk and rewards of entrepreneurship, and an admiration for those who made their enthusiasm for a product or idea work to their advantage.The history and environment surrounding the advent of each of the entrepreneurs is especially enlightening, spotlighting how each person was able to see current trends and how they could capitalize upon them.Though sometimes lengthy and repetitive, the book is an overall good read for anyone interested in business, marketing, strategy or history. I particularly liked the stories surrounding Heinz, Estee Lauder, and Starbucks."
5,You shan't be disappointed.,"Woods Tea Company is, first and foremost, awesome. I bought this CD at a show of theirs and I'm so happy I did. I actually asked them which one I should buy, since they had a couple out, and they all recommended this one because the music is the best (even though this CD isn't their best-seller). They are extremely talented musicians (each member plays at least 3 instruments or more), in addition to being hilarious later middle-aged dudes. Banjos, penny whistles, acoustic guitars, and much MUCH more; if you want an album you can really sing and clap along to, one with a hint of Celtic mixed in with the American Folk and Bluegrass, do it up. Buy it. I'm serious. Amazing."
3,"Great mix of vintage R'n'B, New Orleans & Latin sounds","With their funky New Orleans rhythms and searing saxophone lines, the Iguanas are guaranteed to crowd the dance floor. Their latest LP, the first since leaving Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville label, admirably captures the intoxicating groove. Theirs is a heady blend of vintage R `n' B, Latin and New Orleans sounds, hopping genres in the same effortless manner as Los Lobos or NRBQ. Equally at home bashing out blues-rockers (""Born Again Devil"") accordion driven comedies (""Dear Walter"") and soulful societal narrations (""Latin Kings""), the Iguanas are no less than a party in a box.Catch them live if you can, or bring the party home through the magic of recorded sound."
5,Soul Christmas for the Soul,"I purchased this CD 5 years ago and everytime I play it it's like the first time I played it. Every cut on the cd is great I mean from the Drifters to Luther, I especially like the Marjie Joseph cut Christmas Gift it takes me back to the 70's. I would urge anyone to purchase this I listen to it year round, 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, a must have."
5,White Christmas Classic!,"This collection includes the wonderful, classic, Doo-Wop recording of White Christmas by The Drifters! That one track is worth the price of the CD!!!"
5,"For the Boys,yes indeed!","I didn't know which of Bette Midler's great albums to chose, I like most all of them. So I chose the most middle of the road one that I could think of. I recommend BathHouse Bette,Thighs and Whispers,Live,The Rose,Divine Miss M,Rosemary Clooney Songbook...you get the picture,all of them...Favorite Cuts:PS I Love You, In My Life, Stuff Like That There,Billy-A-Dick,I Remember You.For All We Know,Come Rain or Come Shine. The songs from her career are just flooding my head as I write this...Big Socks,Only in Miami is Cuba So Far Away.. La Vie En Rose.Beast of Burden. I was talking to my boyfriend Ernie,you know.Somebody stop me! Now on to Madonna and other great gaping issues."
4,GREAT for kids,"Amberwatch is a great kid product-- we have 4 of them. The ONLY problem with them is that sometimes you get one that's not so loud---which is why we have 4 of them"" 2 are very loud (as they claim they are) and 2 are noy loud at all. The only reason I don't have a problem with this is because proceeds go to the Amberwatch Foundation."
5,LOVE IT,"I'm a HUGE Kingdom Hearts fan, when I saw this I fell in love with it lol. So I ordered it, shipping was very fast!"
1,Big Mouth Toilet Monster - Green,This product was a complete failure. I could not get it to fit on the toilet. I wasted my money on this item. Do not buy
3,extremly funny,We had a blast using this for the last family gathering!I will say the suction cups dont want to stay put and I will probably have to change them. But still worth the laughs!
2,Something to watch,"So I got this due to the ratings and reviews. I made alot of sense, but is not a movie. It has scenes in it and then people comment on it the scene. I could of done without alot of comments, just some here and there would of been better. Overall the scenes were good."
4,Worth watching and discussion,I watched this movie and thought I was looking at snapshots of family and friends around me (whether black or white). I also silently (not registered) visit the movie forum to gain enlightenment as well and sometimes learn from mistakes I have made. The movie obviously could not address every issue in our society but was on point in most of its core plot and I have to applaud the director for having the vision and the determination to complete the project. I pray and hope that there are other elements that the director (Tim Alexander) will produce in the future that can continue to lead us back to the solutions that are affecting our core family structure.
5,I personally learned alot from this film.,"I am not as extreme of a crazy black women like the actress was in this film. But I can admit that at times, I can be dramatic, rude, and may push a mans buttons every now and then. This movie definitely opened my eyes up to a mans perspective. I loved it."
5,Diary of a Tired Black Man,Jimmy Jean-Louis does an incredible job on this movie which could have gone deeper into the psyche of the internal problems of Black relationships. He makes the movie! We need more of this type of movie.
1,Diary of a Tired Black Man,"This is a horrible one-sided film. The creator of this film interviewed some of the most misinformed, crass people on the street to bash Black women. It's impossible for this film to be taken as a serious and relevant ""documentary"" because it doesn't investigate the problems of Black men and women equally. Don't spend money on this DVD, you can hear the same chauvinistic tirade from Black men in a barber shop or corner store.Diary of a Tired Black Man Poster Movie 11x17 Jimmy Jean-Louis Paula Lema Tim Alexander"
5,Perfect to give to impress and delight a friend,"If you ever want to surprise a friend with an album they've never heard of but will be sure to love, this is it. I like EVERYTHING by EBTG. I've seen them twice in concert and they are super talented singers and songwriters. There isn't a genre they haven't mastered. This is a very accessible introduction to their music. Buy one for yourself and one to give away."
1,Clumsy and Hard to Open,I bought this gate and the First Years Hands-Free at the same time to see which one works best. This gate lost: hard to open (the Bionic Hands mentioned in other reviews) and hard to install.Get the First Years Walk-Thru.
5,"Great, strong gate - we use it all over house","I saw the other reviews and had to write. First off, it's a tension gate. *Of course* it releases the tension when you open it! That's the point! Anyway - we use this gate all over the house. We have odd sized doorways and didn't want holes in our walls or on our staircases like other gates require.We first tried one of those netted tension gates that you screw out to provide tension and that was much harder to adjust than this one. It also slipped easily when our two year old threw herself against it.Bottom line, if you follow the directions this is a great gate."
2,"Story great! Physical book, not so much",I bought this book for my wife for Christmas. She really enjoyed the story and art work. But pages started coming unbound and falling out as soon as she started reading it.
3,Grounded for Life,"I've seen real parent/child fights get ugly, but Brian Vaughan and Adrian Alphona take the age-old war to a whole other level. When six teens discover their parents' deadly inner circle, they band together to keep themselves and any hope of escaping their evil legacy alive. Collecting issues 1-6 of ""Runaways,"" Vaughan is busy establishing the characters and whatnot, and business doesn't really pick up until near the end. But Vaughan's cast lives in a world of their own--with no other heroes stealing their thunder--making ""Runaways"" a promising diversion from Marvel's mainstays.This comic is rated for ages 12 and up: Violence."
3,toe cleavage,"Love the color, material and height, but I just can't do the toe cleavage... Returning."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this installment of the series which, to me, was predictable from the first chapter.Dave and Kathryn's personal issues began overshadowing the priest killings less than halfway into the book, which just led up to what was the inevitable ending. Since I've enjoyed this series so much since the beginning, I was disappointed to find that there was no twist or turn and that this is the direction the author chose to go.Add in all the graphic lust and sex, and it wasn't at all what one usually expects from this series."
5,Works great!,"I had a recipe for cherry preserves, which recommended using a cherry pitter. I had never seen one before, but then I saw it on Amazon. The product works very efficiently. Oxo has made a great design. It is comfortable and stores compactly."
2,Oxo has done better,I was a little disappointed in this product. I pitted some olives and it took quite a bit of strength to work it. The olives were not all that hard.
5,This thing changed my life!,"Length:: 0:05 MinsA little dramatic, I admit, but seriously. It used to take me so long to pit cherries by hand. I just received my cherry pitter today and I was able to pit an entire bowl full of cherries in the time it used to take me to do a handful by hand, and with very little mess. I love it!"
3,NOT dishwasher safe,"The pitter works great. I'd give it 5 stars for what it does, though I can't say I know much about cherry pitting or whether this thing is actually better than other products/methods. BUT overall it gets only 3 stars from me. Why? Because, although the packaging clearly states ""dishwasher safe,"" after only 2 washings the splatter guard has warped to the point where it no longer fits over the guide pins.*So, my advice: buy this pitter because it works well. But when it comes time to wash, put the main portion in the dishwasher and either wash the guard by hand or keep it on at all times (and don't expect to be able to remove it once its been through the dishwasher a couple times).*I realize this might not be a problem with dishwashers that don't use a high-temperature drying cycle."
4,Pit Stopper!,"No more biting into olives or cherries and having to deal with the pits. WooHoo, item is great, easy to use and clean.Great Deal!"
1,There is a Problem?,"Well for starters///it only has usage for GT One 1.0, not 1.1 version. Once I spent the time to enter all the codes for 1.1 version and the program asked me to insert the game disk. I did click the ok button and it proceeded all the way to te screen to select either Arcade or Simulation mode. I selected Simulation and it froze up...over and over and over. So, if anyone has a solution or can explain to me what I missed or may of done wrong...please let me know? The game cost me quite a pretty penny and no instruction manual or bok cam with it. I may get stiffed once, but not a second time! Happy New Year people!"
3,Too small,"This bag is very nice and professional looking. However please not that it is much too small. It holds my 13 inch mac book pro, an average sized text book, and that is all. If you planning on holding anymore than that it will not close so be forewarned. If you want a nice bag for your laptop and maybe a book then this is a very nice product"
5,The stunning debut.,"Tori Amos. An immensely talented woman. This is the album that just began the amazing relationship between Tori and her extremely loving fans. She displays her soul for you. She lets you into her head. She helps guide you. Tori's ""Little Earthquakes"" isn't just an music album, it's a phenomenon. It's beautiful. It's tantalizing. It is extremely hard not to be drawn to her. If you've never heard Tori before, start by listening to this album. Then move on to ""Under the Pink,"" ""Boys for Pele,"" and her newest wonder, ""from the choirgirl hotel."" You'll be hooked too. Then, of course, there are all those scrumptious bee sides!"
2,Emotional scars and sexual politics,"Tori Amos' songs are very lyric-heavy, which tends to overpower the presence of her music. While perhaps cathartic for the artist dealing with a rape, lyrics like ""I wanna smash the faces of those... Christian boys. So you can make me come--that doesn't make you Jesus"" make it somewhat overbearing, or at least an isolating experience for fifty percent of her potential audience. While it's admirable to know oneself, her emotional examination constantly flirts with self-pity.This album was released after the rise to underground popularity of Ani DiFranco and the cult of girl power. Amos is heavily influenced by the pseudo-movement but doesn't break any new ground."
2,Oh come on now...,"""Why are you giving this album only 2 stars? After all, you like the music, and Tori Amos' beautiful voice shines through on this album.. so.. ? Let's have it!"" I feel that the reference to, ""smashing faces of those beautiful boys.. Christian boys"" and the reference to ""Jesus"" are negative, and ruin the album. Shame on you, Tori Amos!"
5,Just amazing,"Tori's debut album is so amazing. Every song is beautiful and rich with feeling and emotion. The song ""Me And A Gun"" is one of the most chilling of songs, especially since it's just Tori and her stunning voice. ""Winter"" and ""China"" are two lovely ballads, while the up-tempo ""Tear In Your Hand"" is also enjoyable. If you want an album that is personal, emotional, and just great to listen to, listen to this one, or any of Tori's releases."
5,Essential album,This is an essential record for your collection. It's very inspired and raw with feeling. Tori is my favourite female singer of all time.
5,Brilliance Personified,"Tori Amos is an absolute genius and this album proves it. I can listen to this CD over and over again and it just gets better each time. The only problem is that after one experiences the genius of Tori Amos, other artists seem shallow and superficial in comparison. Tori's brilliance is unparalleled in today's music industry. If you are tired of bubble gum pop and want to listen to something you can really sink your teeth into, and if you want to be moved and inspired beyond belief, buy this CD--you won't be sorry!"
4,Very Alternative,"I liked this album. I waited a long time for it. It's got a more alternative style to it. There's a little rebellion in there as well (which Tori can be known for). I loved the last song on the disk, ""Little Earthquakes."" It's probably the dartkest of all the songs on the album. I still can't quite understand it, but it's good anyway. The album overall is great. I would recommend this album to all of the new Tori listeners because it is a bit easier to understand then some of her other ones. Overall, it is a great album and I highly recommend it."
3,intense but morbid etc.,"This album is melodrama, most of it. Potent but....more like catharsis than music. This album is therapy for lost little girls maybe?"
1,Disappointed,"I bought the marionette for my 3 year old, and he has never played with it. The strings are so thin they constantly tangle, making moving its arms and legs almost impossible. I would not recommend this product because of the strings."
4,Basic but good,Very basic but nice for my friend with vision problems.She was THRILLED to receive it.My only problem was when she opened it I noticed the binding is detached in the front meaning it will probably not hold up.
5,Crank up the volume!!!!,"Led Zeppelin Remasters gives you all the major Zep tunes in one convenient 2 CD set.Jimmy Page oversaw the digital remastering and the sound is excellent.Zep purists my be slightly annoyed at the sequencing of the tunes (like with ""Heartbreaker"") but the casual fan shouldn't mind a bit.So stick this in your CD player, pump up the bass, crank up the volume and prepare to be blown away by the greatest R&R; band ever!"
5,Great!,My 6 year old daughter loves this puzzle! Another quality product from Melissa & Doug. Nice thick puzzle pieces. Highly recommend.
1,Piece of junk!,"We bought this costume to match the costume of Jack Skellington for a party. Although in its description, it says that the back of the costume is solid pink lace, I think that this is something that has to be put in BIG BOLD letters, as it makes the costume simply unwearable. Just imagine: from the front, the costume doesn't look so bad, but once you turn around... it's a pink bathrobe! How awesome, two pieces of clothing in one! The wig is a whole new story - only 1/3 of it actually has hair, the rest is PINK too!I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that this is the official Disney licensed costume...By the way, it looks like the other review was left by the shop that sells this junk. They gave it 5 stars... how nice!"
2,Boring and not exactly a good representation.,"I felt like this story went on and on without much originality. I was dissapointed by the representation of the nonorganic produce as ugly and unattractive because I have found the opposite to be true. I do buy organic produce but I find the ""conventional"" produce to usually appear healthier, bigger, and brighter. It would have been nice to see the deception involved in producing food to be explored better."
5,"Excellent presentation of ""statistics for the beginner""","Engagingly written, with clear (and usually relevant) anecdotes, the book succeeds in the attempt to present statistics as a subject available to the amateur. I especially enjoyed the examples at the end of the book, where I could check out how well I had grasped the concepts earlier presented. So many experts barrage us with statistics that attempt to influence our viewpoints, actions, activities and votes, that it is important to be able to know whether or not the information is valid and complete. With the analysis tools provided by the author, one can more effectively decide whether or not the facts presented are valid or accurate."
2,You can find better deals,"Find it somewhere else,they have real silver rings by other merchants.Discoloration was visible no more than 2 mos into purchase.IMHO go with something else and keep searching sorry to be so down to the point but find something else and pay the extra $10-15."
2,"More like ""Wandering Mess""","With comparisons to Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams, and a collection of really amusing testimonials, I was ready to really enjoy this book. I wasn't actually expecting Pratchett, Adams (or Wodehouse, or Verne - all of whom David Garnett is favourably compared to), but I was at least expecting something amusing.I kept waiting for something funny to happen.The only really good part is when Wayne Norton (or John Wayne, or Duke Wayne, or James Bogart, whichever hilarious moniker he is using that chapter) is captured by historians, who question him about ancient earth, and seem to have gotten most of their history from cowboy movies.As far as Bikini Planet, we don't even see the frikken place until about page 230.The endings are all quite disappointing, and don't wrap up half the loose ends, answer any questions, or even have A SINGLE LAUGH IN THEM!!Somehow I did finish the book, though, which is the only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one."
5,found at last,I read this book about five years ago and loved it - lent to some one and lost it. And now I've found it at Amason I can have a copy of my own again. Such a fabulous cavalcade of events takes Atwood's edible woman and turns even her upside down.
3,"Did the job, but not the best quality",This did the job of hooking my smartphone to the TV (bought a year ago) - but the quality of audio and visual was far from HD.
4,Good book for the beginner to intermediate player,"I think the pre flop strategies are the best part of the book, as they are broken down into four categories and generally better than Sclansky. For those who find the math in poker difficult this book might help as it goes through in detail very basic EV calculations.What this book is lacking is some depth and skills for higher stakes. It should be useful up to 2/4 but has little to add for 15/30 and above. It has some good thoughts in every chapter, but most of the time is spent on the mechanical aspects of poker, like pot odds, EV of free card etc.For those who do not buy all good poker books, make sure you have red Ed Millers ""Small stakes hold'em"" first. This is in my view the best beginner - Intermediate level book in the market."
2,Cat Carrier,"Certainly looks good, however it came without assembly instructions and lots of small parts. I emailed the manufacturer for instructions and received them, but I can't yet make sense of them. Good luck with yours! Update: Don't buy this! Assembly required, but without all the needed parts or instructions! I had to email for instructions, only to discover missing parts and a whole lot of extra, unrelated parts. No pad for your pet, who has to lay on bare plastic. Hope there's no accidents! This obviously was intended by the manufacturer to be assembled by the reseller prior to sale. I'm going over to my local pet store and buy one there."
5,Awsome little learning blocks,"Just wanted to say that these blocks are very detailed and we are very pleased with the size. Our nine month old will be receiving these for his first birthday. When I pulled them out of the box our son was very interested in them when he saw them, but sadly Dad says we have to wait tell his birthday. Cant wait to see him play with them. The only downside I would have is that the wood on the bottom of the wagon is pretty thin and I am afraid his foot might go through if he puts weight on it. But over all we are very pleased."
4,"Now about ""Lost in Germany""","Just wanted to point out that ""Lost in Germany"" (one of my favorite KX songs) is not about touring in Europe. It's a metaphor for how the writer felt increasingly out of place in the typical Christian setting; it foreshadows the later move away from that world. Listen to it again with this in mind, and you'll catch the brilliance of the lyrics and Bible references. Hope the members of King's X come back to at least some of what they've rejected.Like many other reviewers here have said, this was definitely not my favorite KX release when I first heard it. It grows on you quite a bit, though, and does have some solid classics--""Lost in Germany"" being the best example."
2,Nice if it worked better!,"Our first batch netted us two fairy shrimp and one Triop. Apparently the shrimp get mixed in fairly often. The Triop doubled in size almost daily and was fascinating to watch. It grew for about a week, then abruptly died.Working on second and third batch now in separate containers. Found one speck swimming, don't know if it's a fairy shrimp or a Triop.This would have been much better if worked as advertised.Next time I'm buying Sea Monkeys."
1,junk,"They never hatched. Poor directions. Disappointing for children (and adults). Major waste of money. Can't figure out how to get in touch with the company. Will not purchase smithsonian ""educational"" experiments again."
1,Disappointing,Purchased as gift for daugther. Picture on box looks much better than what's actually in box. Triops did not hatch. Would advise against buying.
3,Clueless,"I bought this for my Daughter, it is huge!! And I have yet to figure out how to fold it. If you are looking for a good size stroller this is the one. And it is tall enough for my 6 year old and she is tall for her age. But I would like to know how to fold it to take it in the car."
3,Where can I find this Stroller?,"Hello, my daughter is interested in getting this stroller can anyone tell us where else we may be able to find it?Amazon is out, and we cannot find it anywhere else, not even at Graco.Also, what price range is it in? We are looking at a few different models.ThanksMom in KC"
5,great stroller!,"I am 11 years old and I love dolls. My mom thought the stroller was going to be to little for me ,but it's just right!It looks just like the real one. It's a little difacult to fold.I love the stroller,but there's one problem.You can't fit two carseats in,you can fit one in the back but not in the front.Over all I love this stroller! I hope this review is helpful to you!"
5,the best game,"this game is very cool, you should really play this game.thier are new courts that exsist in manhattan in new york they are from all the cities this game isnt that much all the people like this game even the rap are good not that good but you will still like to hear it when you are playing thier are new moves in this game like back 2 papa off the hezaay and the best thing is that you can customise your own rules in the option buy this game hurry in the shop."
4,Basketball 2003 style,"This game got me through my summer job. In this game, you can choose to be an old school team or a new generation team. You can be a hall of fame player like Wilt Chamberlain and Doctor J, or a newfound celebrity player like Kobe Bryant or Allen Iverson. You can pick what type of basketball court you want to play on according to the city. They even have a section where you can be Nelly or one of the St. Lunatics. I love the way the controller vibrates everytime you make a dunk. When you play this game you really feel like you are playing on a basketball court because you get all into the game and feel very competitive. You sart talking junk to the other players, run around trying to steal the ball from them, and then find yourself jumping up and down when you win your game or make a really nasty shot. The graphics are good on this game also."
4,"More Like Three and a Half, What's Up With Sports Games?","I just don't get people who buy sports games. Why, sooner or later, the more current developments will arise, making the ""new"" sports games feel like trash in a few months. Take NFL 2K3, for example. That game used to be [$$$], give or take, when it was new. But after a few months, when the season's over, mabye even sooner, the price goes down, down to [$$$] now in the [store] catalogues.Now, don't get me wrong. NBA Street Vol 2 is a GREAT game. Great gameplay and commentary. I've played it, and enjoyed it while it lasted (played it at a friend's house). But, as I said, current events rules the mainstream of Sports Themed Games. That's why I give it four stars."
3,Don't be fooled by the high ratings,"Sure, the graphics and gameplay in NBA Street Vol. 2 are good, but you'll play this game maybe a week before it ends up gather dust in your collection. There really is no replay value to it. As the game is only $20, I wouldn't call it a waste of money. Mark my words, however, you'll quickly tire of this title."
2,WOW,"ok. First of all i bought the first gamr and i thought is was great. So when the second one came out i was like sweet.i bought the second one and i first played it on the easiest level and i thought that this was gonna be better than the first one. Well...we all make mistakes. i played it on the second highest level and i got stomped. if u shoot a 2 with like ray allen or somethin itll fall 1 out of 50 times, it is horrible. ohh ya i was up 19 to 5(one of the rare occation i was up) and they came back and they beat me. every time i tryed to dunk it my guy would either miss or hit is head on the rim. oh ya again one game the other team had like 20 steals and i had like 5. its not fun. It is about as fun as gettin shot in the face. DONT BUY THIS GAME."
2,Better Graphics however significantly slower gameplay,"NBA Street 1 was a fun and innovative game well liked for its almost realtime gameplay feel. The sequel however, is almost like a dropdead gorgeous girl with no brains, great to look at but other than that, a bore...So the game has its good and bad points but overall any fan of the first version might want to consider getting it because of the old skool players like Wilt Chamberlain, and the Bulls Micheal Jordan and it's new game features such as Be A Legend Mode, Pick Up Mode, etc. if you are just trying the genre out for the first time though, get the first one."
1,This game sucks,this game is the worst game i played. it doesn't even look real. it looks like my ass threw up graphics. they coul have done better. the first one was wayy better than this sucky version for punks that cant handle the real thing. yeah. that's rite. U punks dont know nothin. i played better games made for 2 year olds. how come no one shoots anyone in the game? Allan Iverson does it on a regular basis. and how come there aren't any indian people in the game? dont descriminate.
4,An Excellent Introduction to George MacDonald,"Although I agree with the previous reviewer up to a point, I recommend this little book as an introduction to MacDonald's writing. It is easy to read and contains deep truths that penetrate to the heart. He brings a fresh and unique perspective from a deep understanding of our Heavenly Father's love for us. This is a book for those who hunger after righteousness, for those who, in MacDonald's words, trust that ""increasing desire is the sign that satisfaction is drawing nearer."" As Corbin Scott Carnell, University of Florida, has said, ""Rolland Hein's expert condensation makes these writings accessible to our time."" If I personally hadn't begun with this book I may never have wanted to buy the sermons in their original, unedited form."
5,GREAT BACKPACK!!!!!:):):):):):):):):):),"I got this backpack for my 5000 series hp laptop. I was tired of the case i had. The only grip i have is it it just fits my laptop. A half inch longer and i wouldn't be able to zip up the backpack. I have a 15.4 inch widescreen. Other then that, this is a great backpack for me. Lots of space to put stuff, and it has nice padded shoulder straps so if you do fill it up. it won't hirt your shouldersI would recommend this backpack any day"
5,Great backpack!,"Has pockets for everything you could possibly want. Fits my 17"" laptop in the large compartment easily. Comfortable to wear due to lots of padding."
4,A Nice BackPack,"A real nice backpack. I don't think it's as huge as some people say. I do not think it will fulfill both my electronic needs and my law books. But that does not mean it is not nice. The quality is still excellent, and I remain happy with the purchase.Update:This Pack lasted me through 4 years of hard use. It was a warrior. I brought it everywhere. It protected my laptop well, and it could hold 2 hefty law school textbooks. It did this service all through law school, and I'm happy I had this bag. I particularly enjoy the open area at the front of the backpack that one cans simply toss things in. I also enjoyed that there were loads of little pockets for things like flash drives, sd cards, pens, business cards, etc. In short, this pack was great and served me well. In fact, after 4 years of heavy use, I turned around and sold it to a buyer who was happy with the purchase, and thought it had lots of life in it, still. This is a well-built, well-priced pack."
4,Computer Backpack Review,"4.5 out of 5 starsThis is the best notebook pack I have ever used. The quality is excellent: heavy-duty zippers and strong plastic reinforcements at the bottom. The grip is round and comfortable, all straps are adjustable, and there is thick padding on back and straps. The pack is visually very appealing and provides great comfort even when carrying heavy loads. The side-pockets are a little narrow and long and I don't really use them. This is a great business/college/town/shopping/carry-on backpack with lots of space."
4,"Versatile Backback, good protection, excellent capacity",Great all around backpack for lugging laptop and books to school. It has a fairly large capacity but it also has tension straps so you can compact it. One of the best features is the open compartment which is perfect for gym shoes or clothes.
4,I like this!,"I walked down the aisle in a rose garden in 1993 to ""Wilderness"", so my husband and I are partial to this album. I was so happy to find this on Amazon and downloaded the mp3 so we can share it with our girls :) I find their music to be very relaxing....I love it all!"
2,Disappointed,"Since my aim is to learn to speak German well, I was disappointed because the video itself has a visual problem; there are streaks throughout, not to the point of being totally unclear (which explains why I'm not returning it), but enough to distort the picture. Too, and most disappointing of all is that the German words come across muffled. Also, since no English translation workbook came with the package, it is very difficult for me to know the meanings of words of which I am unfamiliar. Trying to find these unfamiliar words in the German dictionary is equally problematic because generally the words used in the video are either in the future tense or past tense (i.e., Peter ist verliebt), which the dictiornary in most cases does not recognize. In any case, I'm struggling to find an English translation workbook to help me through the unfamiliar words. How can I learn the language if I don't know what's being said??? I need to see at least some of it in English. Help!"
2,Not Very Sweet,"I normally use the KAL Pure Stevia Extract Powder and I thought that is what I was ordering when I bought this product, but it is nothing like it. I have to use a LOT more of this product to get anything sweet enough. With the Pure Stevia Extract Powder, I only needed a tiny bit."
4,The Infinite Tulip,"The photography is fantastic! The book was a bit smaller in size than I expected. Overall, it is just amazing."
3,Smelled better in the store.,"I tried this in Filene's and really liked it but didn't want to spend $50. I found it here for under $40 shipped. It smells different than it did in the store, more soapy and less distinct."
4,Vivid story,"I am very impatiently waiting for the sequel (have been for a year now). Even though it's been awhile since I last read this book, I still remember it clearly due to the vivid writing style, and the colorful and realistic characters. Just recalling it makes me impatient for In Fire Forged, and starts me wondering about the fates of the main characters all over again. The heroes have their weaknesses and yet the story does not get bogged down with heros' problems, self-recriminations and so on. The pacing keeps the excitement going and the whole 'cause' is believable and worthy. The only reason why a star is missing in this review is because one development in the story I found unneccessary and off-putting. This development, however, does not ruin the book. So read and enjoy!"
5,THE BEST!!!!!!!,I'm soooo glad I got this book. To think I almost miss this book is apalling! It has twists that takes you by surprise and just grabs you with pair of iron strong hands. You won't be able to put it down. I would have stayed up a whole night if I didn't have practice the next day. You MUST read this. I assure you that you will LOVE this one.
4,"Resnick's ""In Legend Born"" is quite interesting.","This book contains a fascinating combination of both politics and fantasy. In the island of Sileria, the conquered Silerians hoped for a sovereign nation where they could live freely. As a result of one man, the islanders rose up in protest against the Valdanis. Guardians, assasins, commoners, and waterlords together fought off the overwhelming Valdanis. But at the same time, betrayals within the Silerians occur. This book is very interesting and easy to read, but the negative thing I can say about this book is the lack of suspenseful events."
5,"Great for older kids, too","This has been a great purchase - more than worth the money. I had three kids in the local level National Geographic Spelling Bee. My 12 year old won and needed to prepare for the state test. We bought this Quantum Pad booklet and it has been a fun way to review information we already covered. It also helped her to learn the most important African countries which was the one area she was reluctant to even try to memorize. I sure wish we had bought this before the bee to help all the kids prepare, especially my reluctant learners.The country's names and locations seem to be up to date within the past year or two.Warning: this doesn't have ALL the countries of the world, just the well-known ones. It does cover all of the continents. If you want to learn the US and Europe in depth, the sampler booklet that came with the Quantum pad is much more detailed and useful."
1,Almost a good phone,All features are very competitive and complete BUT the handset volume is absolutely unacceptable. I tried 2 of these and they both are almost useless. I have 4 other Vtechs models with no problems. Vtech company has givin me no recourse or satisfaction to where I would be very hesitant to buy another one of their products.
1,what a joke,jessie's girl and a couple of other songs that means greatest hits? his whole music career is one big tv movie.
2,What a letdown from Souls of Black,"This album is way slower then anything in their previous work. It comes off sounding un-inspired and dry. Not quite as bad as the albums to follow, which are REAL garbage, but just not an enjoyable album. Souls of Black and the three preceding albums are there best work and what they should be remembered by. Don't buy this or anything made afterwards. True, it is all a matter of opionion. I see reviews on this site of this album saying it is their favorite Testament album. And I've even seen negative reviews for Souls of Black. But hey, this is the Steveman here, would I lie to you? What would I gain in doing that? I'm only trying to save you money and disappointment.Not a good album."
4,The Marines go to Baghdad,"We in Australia don't hear very much about the US Marines in action in Iraq or Afghanistan. But this book (and Bing West's other book No True Glory) changes all of that. We are taken onto the front line and given a first hand account of the action. A fast-moving, authoritative and sometimes humorous story."
3,Decent enough,"This book was a decent read. Congrats to Bing West, he gets to cash in on his reporting on the way to Baghdad. It's well written and has some guilty pleasure moments and honestly is useful in portraying small unit engagements throughout the campaign. Is it anything special? Not really. Are there better books about the road up, hell yes (One Bullet Away/Generation Kill, Cobra II even Thunder Run). West even has more thorough and awesome books about OIF including ""No True Glory"" (haven't read Strongest Tribe yet). Yes, it might not be about the invasion but they are better written and offer everything ""The March Up"" does about actual engagements as well as a more comprehensive view of what is going on."
1,Not A Real Account,The story is hurtful and painful for those of us who knew Jenny and lived this nightmare. While the story is totally fictional the characters are too close to the real life people and anyone who reads this book could believe that this was truely her family and friends. The book is poorly written and I would not recommend this book to anyone.
5,Wonderful piano music,"I bought this 5 CD collection of Satie piano music for my wife for Christmas since she mentioned liking a CD of Satie's piano pieces played by Pascal Rogé that I had on a few weeks earlier. We've listened to the whole collection and both enjoy it very much. It is unfortunate as another reviewer pointed out that the liner notes are only in French, but I imagine we'll be able to find a list of his works in English somewhere on the internet. Many of the pieces are short and there are so many of them that it would be hard to keep them apart even if we did have notes in English. We're just happy to have all this beautiful music to listen to. I'm not musically sophisticated enough to judge Ciccolini's interpretations of Satie's music, but they seem fine to me and the CDs sound good despite having been recorded between 1967 and 1971."
3,Why so many printing errors?,"This book has innumerable printing errors (typos). I've never read another volume in the series but I can't imagine they were proofread so casually. And to think the subject being such an important, even sacred, book would be represented with such sloppiness, oy!Also, in the chapter on Talmudic discussion, the author states at the beginning that the Talmud allows us to see that the sages felt that the conclusion was more important than the process and at the end of the chapter he says just the opposite. Huh?However, that being said, I am learning and getting a taste and will pursue learning more Talmud as a result of reading this volume."
5,More than good advice,"I haven't had a chance to read this book yet, but I can attest to the authors vast knowledge of Jewish scholarship and culture. A real virtuoso. Anyone interested in this subject would be a fool to look elsewhere. And I appreciated the other reviews and advise especially the suggestion to purchase SpaceBalls along with this selection."
5,Betty Cocker Bisquick II Cookbook,"I loved the book, as I have baked with Bisquick for years. It also is a very big plus for my cookbook collection. I have the original Bisquick Cookbook and this one is a plus.Thank You"
