1,"Too many mistakes, the first one was me buying this book!","Do NOT buy this - you will end up spending time returning it, or worse, having it sit on your shelf because you don't have time to return it and you just wasted a ton of money on this book!It is filled with mistakes and contridictionsVery hard to read...boring is an understatement!!Stick with Sybex...you won't be disappointed...I love the new Todd Lammle book. I learn and laugh, something that you can't find too much these days!!"
2,"Five megapixels, sharp lens, but SLOOOWW write-speeds","The E-20 is an improved model over last year's E-10 (only 4 megapixels), but the seriouss flaw of the VERY slow write-speeds to card from its memory buffer is a major drawback. Some people would argue that it's not too bad due, but if you need somethign quick once in a while, this is NOT the camera to get. For instance, press photographers and photojournalists who need to fire off 30 shots in rapid succession will be VERY frustrated by this camera. Even parents who want take shots of their child as s/he runs about will be annoyed at constantly WAITING for the camera to write, and will miss many shots.On the positive side, the lens, F2.0 - F2.4 4x with a mechanically linked zoom ring, 5 megapixels of resolution, a professional 'locked control' system, a wide variety of manual control and a robust metal case.But all those positives are knocked out by the slow write speed. Skip this camera."
5,Quality Product,"Well, after 3 years of serious consideration, I finally went digital. I spent hours an hours considering which camera to buy, and since I've had great experience with Olympus in the past, I looked at the E10 and E20. Once I got relatively acquainted wuth these two, I looked at other models.I went with the E20 and I could want little else. It is easy to use, and easy to learn all the functions and I find it very user friendly. On top of that the images are amazing. The program mode is almost fool proof, and you get great results all the time if you are just taking quick shots for WYSIWYG images.For tose fearful of the woeful reports of battery consumption, just go out and get three sets of Nickle Metal Hydride batteries and a rapid charger and you'll be set. If you plan on going on a trigger-happy outing and do that often, you might want to consider Olys Lithium Polymer battery setup. It is an investment, but it will ultimately pay for itself."
3,Negative assessment of the great commander,"Schom has clearly not made the typical mistake of many biographers: falling in love with the character they study. As a matter of fact it seems he made the opposite mistake. However, in spite of the negative tone of Schom's biography, it provides a good balance to other material on Bonaparte. In particular, Schom's constant emphasis on the cost of human lives and property that the Napeolonic campaigns inflicted on all of Europe (and Egypt) puts things into perspective. As the only book on Napoleon it is incomplete. Even if Bonaparte was the great ""ogre"", what he accomplished in a period of 10 years (from 1799 to 1809) was nothing short of amazing. This is the most fascinating aspect of Napoleonic history. The battle descriptions (and their associated maps) are not very good. To conclude: good overview of Napoleon, better if complemented by other books (Chandler or Zweig). If you are interested only on the military aspects stick to Chandler's book."
1,Flawed book,"This is all around, an awful book. Slow, with numerous grammatical errors, Schom has truly written one of the great paperweights of all time! The book is good for nothing else, other than holding down your papers, or used as a doorstop. While he may have a lot of sources in the book, he seems to omit them at critical moments (i.e. the French economy) and almost make up numbers, etc., out of his own head! Warning to anyone interested: do not buy this book!"
5,This is the canon for documentaries,"Ebert was right on this one - the 7 Up series, now at 42 Up is one of the best films of all time.Many kudos to director Michael Apted for sticking with these individuals lives and respecting their boundaries, while being able to get intimate with them.Despite the originators Labour Party-esque intentions, Apted stuck with it and it has revealed that you can't categorize people by political prognostications.Every person is a valuable part of the whole. They are a timeline in our times. This is done in the UK and where some now live overseas.In an age of spin, this is the real life. This is the canon for documentaries.Fantastic, now the whole series is available on DVD.Looking forward to 49 Up!"
1,This toy does not work!,"We received the toy and went out to get the 9-volt batteries immediately because my 6 year old wasvery anxious to play with them. Nothing we did would make the walkie talkies work. Needless to say, we wasted good money on a toy that never worked."
4,I Like It,This is an old and reliable product. I have been using it for years. It is a consistently high quality product.
5,"Making Heartfull Communication, That's Our Wishness","The perfect Goods to climax a happy occassion...to make any occassion happy. This GOODS goes along. I'm an useful and enjoyable book, making friendly wiseness. Allows to banish negetive mind to land of ghosts and wind! He always stays near you to be called ""friendly"". None other seldom exeeds to this, for Captain, chief of thought, important man, or other. For home-life an work-life, won't you be called enjoyable? Many do!"
2,Watch Out!,"This author sent me a piece of spam, which I ordinarily throw straight in the trash. However, the subject matter caught my attention, so I went to his very poorly designed and written website inside of AOL. He repeats himself all over the place with improper grammar and spelling. This was never a problem with the original Castaneda materials which were professionally written and produced, the main difficulty being the new vocabulary which Castaneda had to build to discuss this off-culture topic. I have worked with Castaneda's techniques with moderate success, so I see between the lines that this author has researched parallel techniques in other cultural traditions and basically wrote about his own experiences. One final note of caution here: the supposed review posted with five stars has the same misspellings and bad grammar found throughout his website, so I presume it is only the author patting himself on the back."
5,Several exciting space travels-ultimate OOB,"Author has written how and what to do to fly into the universe like a phenix in detail concretely. He decoded the oldest classic of out of body (2000 years ago, in China) 7 years ago and has explained about it, too. He has met don Juan Matus and don Genaro just below the white roof of the universe. In addition, about the manners of energy body (psychic world). For example, don't visit others very often or for long time, don't peep at a bathroom,don't use a sharp and strong hook(interlock).It is very interesting. The book seems to be for the advanced course of psychic world."
4,Very comprehensive book on bodybuilding,"This is by far the most comprehensive book on bodybuilding that I read and possibly even more so than Arnold's ""Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding"". The exercises are grueling, no doubt. But you better be hardcore if you are reading this book. Very good chapter on nutrition. Many books forget that this is a key to getting huge. The part it talks about different types of bodybuilders, it does not give enough information on determining if one is a slow-gainer. This type will have to train slowly and work up. Otherwise, excellent book on this topic."
5,Decent quality for a good price,"Installation of these replacement cranks was a snap. All of the hardware fit perfectly and these were true ""replacements"" for me -- no drilling or needing to alter the current set up at all.My only caution to people looking at this type of product is to make sure you are ordering the correct size and SIDE. There is a left-crank, and a right-crank, and they are not interchangeable. I learned that the hard way, but was able to use the ""extra"" hardware and just replaced all the old crank-out window hardware I had.Excellent quality on the product."
2,Vague and primitive,"I have read this book and regrettably found it primitive and obscure. The author seems to have a bit of Java and development knowledge but not much of knowledge as a designer or DBA. His explanation of various items are rudimentary and shallow. When he talks about Cost based optimizer and the way it is used in Oracle, it is pretty clear to me that the author is very light in understanding the basic concepts. There are also a lot of technical errors in describing various constructs and utilities. I think this book will be useful for newcomers but hardly is a ""High Performance Tuning book"" as the book's title says. There are much better books around. Any of Tom Kyte's books will leave this book standing."
1,A pretty book with little useful information.,"If what you're looking for is a nicely designed book with lots of pretty pictures of unusual lampshades, this is a good book. However, if you're looking for practical information on how to make basic lampshades, I suspect you'll be dissapointed. While it does offer how-to's, they apply primarily to the (mostly small) shades pictured (many requiring oddly shaped frames, with no sources for where to get them)."
4,"Strong Female Lead! Strong Plot! Lot's of action, magic!","That's high praise from me. I adore strong female characters. The rest of the characters were good also. I didn't notice any holes in the interesting, attention-grabbing plot and obviously the story will continue. I just hope the title character is at least a major player. I would definitely recommend this as an excellent first fantasy novel."
1,horriable,i am not even going to waste my time writing a review for this horrid book.one word BORING.and a few others.... i want my 8 hours of my life back.
4,A wonderfully realistic fantasy novel !,"I thought this was a great book, with lots of interesting characters. Livak, is perhaps the most interesting fantasy heroine Ive read about in a long time."
4,"Great taste, too many calories","I rated it 4 instead of 5 as the number of calories needed to get to 55 grams protien is around 500, which i think is too much for anyone not exercising too heavily....cant blame the manufacturer, as i didnt look at the nutrition info too closely before buying.....the tase is excellent, especially compared to supplement i am using now....good choice for those not too concerned with the number of calories....."
3,"Average quality, and slightly overpriced...",A reasonable collection of tools... consistently lacking the one's that you need... placed in a flimsy plastic case.Need I say more? :)
3,Iron staff,"For a serious practitioner, this is a good tool. The staff is very heavy (compared to wooden, hollow aluminum (or other 'tournament') staffs.This is not suitable for tournament, it will be very difficult to get your speed up.However, it is excellent for training, if you have been working with a solid wooden staff for some time.If you have, this can really help your 'game'. It is also much fun to take to the do-jang, do-jo, training hall and watch the eyes of your partner when they make or take that first strike!Have fun, work hard; hit early and hit often!"
4,alright,"I got this recently and its cool, fairly heavy and solid. The case is a nice bonus, and its fun to use. The only reason I don't give it five is that its hollow on the inside and it sounds like a rock is trapped in their, which is pretty annoying. Hopefully that's just mine but if you can put up with that get it."
1,Still waiting . . . .,I cannot rate something that has not yet been received. It has been a month since I ordered and nothing has been received to date.
1,"In my opinion, this item is garbage.","I didn't think the blade would be as flexible as it was, but perhaps that's my own fault (my intention was to find an actual nam dao that was not for performance, although i learned that's harder to do than i originally thought).The real problem with this item is that the quality is extremely low. I actually purchased this sword to be ready when I started learning the nam dao techniques from my sifu, but when that time came, I ended up using a Katana instead because the nam do was just not good for training. It MAY be good for performance, so that if anyone wants to train for a show this could be a good sword.The s-shaped guard is loose, it shakes when the sword moves. I treat my training tools and weapons with respect (if that even makes sense lol), but in regards to this item, it is neither a weapon or a training tool, so it stays piled under junk on my floor, the same place it's been since a week or so after I got it."
5,"Absolutely, Positively, WOW!",I don't usually go for this type storyline but I was not disappointed. I'm an avid book listener and couldn't put it down! It was excellent!
4,Excellent!,"I love the characters in this book! I don't often reread by this author, but have to keep rereading this one! Its that good!"
4,touching,"This is a beautifully written novel, one of her best. Its a juxtaposition of metaphysical attraction and earthy humour. Lots of tenderness and a commitment of intimacy."
5,As usual great reading!,"Jane Krentz is wonderful. I started reading her books as Stephanie James, and she just keeps getting better. Harry & Molly's antics make the pages fly by. I am always sorry to reach the last page. I want it to go and on."
4,Great Book!!,This book is absolutely necessary if you are hiking in Denali which has no trails. The book discusses different hikes and gives you pointers to find your way around. Highly recommended.
4,Study of DNA for genealogical purposes,I enjoyed this book by Chris very much.I am starting to understand more andmore about DNA and it's use for genealogy.
3,Pedro's Syn Grease w/3oz Injector,"Was not all the way happy with this order the Injector was used and the packaging from the seller had been opened...I guess it was a way for this seller to get rid of some old stock...Overall the injector worked and the grease did it's job,but by far it was not new..as described in the picture.."
2,not good for kindle.,this book was a waste of my money. examples are in tiny print you need to buy this as a real book
2,Bad sentence structure,Bad sentence structure. Seems like written by a person who has no grammatical knowledge.Hard to interpret what author is trying to say.General editor(Big Shot)did a horrible job editing it.Overall bad book for a notable historian to write.
2,Falling quality,"This book has the air of having been written by someone told ""Do 130,000 words with something about bones."" The style is not that of early Elkins books - the first half padded with extraneous irrelevant descriptions and the end in a few rushed pages. There is a ridiculous improbability in the story which can only be hinted at without giving the plot away. Just note that any pilot knows with accuracy the compass alignment of a familiar runway."
4,recording,"it was fine, now I'm done listening, it has served it's purpose. Delivery and quality, were all what I would expect."
2,Only one good song(in my opinion).,"I heard the song ""The Teeth Collector"" and thought this band was pretty good so I bought the cd. Lucky for me, I hate every other song on here. I am glad I only paid one cent for it(plus shipping). I don't want this cd and will give it to anybody who wants it for free. WOW FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am going to try to sell it at a record store and if they don't want it, the trash or craigslist free section it goes. This review is based on my personal thoughts so don't base it completely off of me, read other reviews.Have an awesome day and keep it real."
5,An Album Worthy of My Top Ten,I just picked up this record and it is truly a great collection of country songs. From a real Americana/Country feel to a current Springsteen vibe the Bastards mix it up like most country artists are afraid to today. I would say they have branched out well past the country classification. Contemporary country artists could only aspire to be as bold as the Bastards. I can only imagine what is in store for us with their next record. It's nice to see artists that experience real growth between albums. These Bastards have set the bar damn high for all who follow them.
1,Disappointment,"I am really disapointed by this big book.The Title is different from what it contains. The Volume is so large, but does not contain great substance. I wish it is possible to return it and have my refund. It is not worth the trouble."
4,Is it suitable for students?,"I want to buy a reference book which is complete, compendious, and useful. Is this handbook suitable for students like us?p.s. Please let me know if this one has tables that lists names and formulas of the most common chemical compounds, as well as the trivial names of them."
5,Rebirth of the Mind,"This CD will make you think. And if we start to think, change will happen. Gandhi and Malclom X would be proud."
5,The Hard Rhymer Brings It,"Chuck D and crew are right on time with their social criticism and spare nothing when attacking the many injustices of our day. Targets range from the war in Iraq, institutionalized racism and the sorry state of popular hip hop. All of this is backed by super tough beats that will get your blood and your fist pumping. Don't cheat yourself - pick this cd up."
2,Nonsense,"This isn't pro-youth rights, sadly.She was molested by a man she knew online when she was 14, nearly 15, and wrote about it in a book called Katie.com. Now, I do believe he was wrong, since he lied to her and tried to pressured her into having sex with him when she didn't want to. I could see sending him away for attempted rape. But Katie's just an idiot. In her book, she kept calling him a pedophile(which he isn't, because he went after teenagers, not children who hadn't yet gone through puberty), and supports parents spying on their children on the internet. I really wish I could say something on her website, but I can see everyone calling me a sicko pedo, as they always do. Just because you had a bad experience it's okay to tell parents to invade their kids' privacy? No. Don't think so.Also, she complains about the objectification of women and says porn is contributing to perverted actions. Studies prove otherwise."
3,Not exactly what I ordered,"Advertised as a spiral bound cookbook, not what I received or what was available per the shipper. The shipper did refund part of the sales price. The book was received in fine condition and has many great slow cooker tasty recipes."
2,The search goes on...,"There were a few things that I did like about this cookbook - the photographs, the binding (hardcover with spiral binding inside), etc... Unfortunately what I didn't like was the most important part - the food.I'll be up front, I've never liked the flavor and textures of vegetables made in a crock pot - everything just seems to get mushy. I only tried a handful of recipes and was disappointed with all of them. Even when the texture wasn't so much of an issue, the flavors were all wrong. I'm sure that there are some good recipes in here as I can see that quite a few people are happy with this cookbook - but this book is not for me.This is the only cookbook (and I have well over 100 in my collection) that I've actually given away. The search for good crock pot recipes continues."
2,processed food,"Many if not most of these recipes call for the addition of processed food: a ""block of processed cheese food"", instant coffee, a package of scalloped potatoes (for a scalloped potato recipe!), condensed soup galore, and many more. Not the healthiest, especially for a person watching her sodium intake."
3,some good...some not so good,"I have used this book over the past three weeks. For the most part, the recipes have been good. Not great...but good. However, I recently tried the sun-dried tomato chicken breast recipe and it was awful. The recipe did not use any liquid, which puzzled me from the start. You do need some type of liquid when using a crockpot. I cooked the dish for an hour less than the recipe called for and the chicken was still so tough as to be uneatable."
4,Its Great,Im a reformed low carb eater... This book is great it gives me the carb counts and protein counts. The meals I have made are divine. It is great for a person who is eating low carb to find a cookbook that helps those who work a decent (not out of the box) meal. Try it.. I got one for all 3 of my sisters.
2,BC's Slow Cooker Cookbook,Not a whole lot of receipes for the money spent. The person I gave it to as a gift likes it though.
2,betty crockers slow cookers cook book,Receipes are out dated and there is not enough variety in the selection of dishes that are in this cook book. Would most likely cook 2 or 3 of the dishes in this book. Expected a lot more from some one like Betty crocker
2,COOK BOOK,USED TWO RECIPES SO FAR. NEITHER CAME OUT WELL. EVERYTHING WAS OVER DONE. STILL TRYING THOUGH
3,Good,It was good but not great. I expected more. The cinematograph was pretty good the narration could have been better. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,One of the better dummies books,"This is the only book I used to study for the Security+ exam. It covered all of the exam topics and provided enough information to answer about 70% of the questions. Even if you aren't trying to pass the exam, the information is organized very well and gives you a good working knowlege of the real world. To answer the other 30% of the questions, I had to use other resources. This book is not a substitute for TestKing or Actualtests.com if you just want to pass the exam. I give this book 3 stars for passing the exam, but 4 stars if you really want to understand computer security."
4,"Little know information, found here!","Very interesting to find out some little know information about our ""Founding Fathers"".Their faith in God played such an important role in their lives and therefore ourfoundation as a country. Now if we could get back to some of those basics!A good read before visiting the Capitol, or to carry along as you tour it."
5,Wonderful Read,"I loved this book! I have finished it in 3 days, and it was hard to put it down. Extremely well written. I got such a vivid view of India through the eyes of Ram. I desperately want to read more now!!"
3,Slumdog Millionaire,"The book was interesting, showing how life is in India, but the book was depressing because of this very reason. I knew that life for the ""common people"" was difficult in India but this showed how bad it really is. We all need to experience the truth of what happens in other countries and this was interesting because it was very revealing to the western world."
2,"Movie Good, Book Bad","The movie ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is one of those few exceptions where the movie is much, much, better than the book it is based on. The academy award for best screenplay adapted from another source was well-earned, as the screenwriter took a really awful book and turned it into a compelling story.The actual writing isn't that good, but what I really did not like about the book was its relentlessly oppressive, depressing tone throughout the story. Nothing but horrible bad things happen to our protagonist and his friends. It might be reality in the slums of Mumbai, but it makes for a dreary time reading about it. I sure hope things aren't that bad for the poor in Mumbai. If they are, how could millions of the poor still be alive? I'd think they'd all be dead from some horrible calamity. If you want to read about third-world slum living, this might be a good book to read. Otherwise, watch the movie and skip the book if the story interests you."
4,Clever story,"A very fun and easy read with a likeable lead character stuck in a series of adventures you wouldn't wish on anyone. Nonetheless, all works out for the best in the end."
4,Beautiful collection,"The movie would have been a lot better had it used these songs. Even though Amazon calls it a soundtrack, nowhere on the cover does the word soundtrack appear. The cover clearly states music inspired by...The songs by Mindy Smith, Buddy Miller(with Emmylou Harris), Guy Clark, Gillian Welch and Ray LaMontagne are all great. CDs with native American flute music are not hard to find. Highly recommended."
5,one of the originals,"This is a reprint of a wonderful testimony. Like Biquis Sheikh's ""I Dared to Call Him Father"", it happened in a time when not many Muslims were coming to Christ. That's what makes it all the more amazing, praise God! We recommend both these books. We also highly recommend the new book by Reema Goode,Which None Can Shut: Remarkable True Stories of God's Miraculous Work in the Muslim World. So encouraging!"
3,Installation guide,"Professional Live Communications Server (LCS) is a great guide to the installation of LCS. It starts with an overview of the LCS architecture and gives some data about performance and scalability. It thouroughly explains the steps needed to prepare Active Directory and the deployment steps of LCS itself. The book's main shortcomings are:- the lack of explanation about the processing that LCS does with SIP messages. The book never explains what LCS actually does. Only how to set it up.- the lack of treatment of the server API that LCS provides. There is a very short mention of it at the start of the book, but it is not presented further.If you need a book about deploying LCS, this is the book for you. If you need a book about LCS's technology and programmability, this book falls short."
1,"recycled,repackaged and re-SOLD !","Materialistic western civilization had always been fertile soil for Dyer and the likes (another example: Anthony Robbins ""borrowing"" NLP to build his own multimillion $$$ empire)). Recycling what is mostly ancient spiritual wisdom, injecting a few metaphors, pathetic garbage and a lousy sense of humor they are laughing all the way to the bank. You have to be dumb, naive or desperate to buy into that. Either way, it's highly dishonest to take advantage of one's weaknesses and/or flaws. Despicable and poor - don't waste your time and cash."
2,No denial,"I wasn't pleased with this product. In my honest opinion, it should be included with another purchase at a deep discount or a freebie."
3,Interesting but Not Professional,"These videos were interesting to watch, as they featured real people with real experiences. There are multiple videos.However, I was not impressed by their advertisements for other videos, some of which teeter on occult things, that I don't think people should be getting into. It really irritated me. I am seeking the truth/wisdom of God's creation.I also was not impressed by their repeated use of the same video graphics over and over again, sometimes with annoying music. This video appears to be of the ""homemade"" variety, rather than the quality production used by shows on The History Channel, such as ""Monster Quest"".I did get a good price on it, which motivated me to purchase this set of discs. I got for less than $10."
3,No stupid jokes from YouTube.,"Not the best video for those who want to watch or learn about the creature. At least it wasn't made by those who clutter YouTube dot com with some useless bigfoot jokes. Made me understand why the science community would not persue looking for this creature. The creature being nocturnal sounds kind of scary. My guess is that scientists are just plain scared of the dark, and their own shadows. Imagine them seeing their own shadows in the moonlight. Takes a few brave researchers to do the job of looking for the creatures."
5,"DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY","This is one of the ultimate chase movies of the 70's. It isn't like Bullitt where there is only a 10 minute chase scene. They run all out throughout the movie. At the end a sublime 1969 Dodge Charger is being chased by police interceptors and helicopters. There are some cool jumps, wrecks and really wild scenes. This has got to be the best ""B"" movie ever made. Trust me you will love it."
3,Watch this to complete your 1970s car chase collection,"Two guys and a girl in a fast car was a common motif in the early 70s.Two-Lane Blacktopdebuted in 1971, whileSugarland Express(Steven Spielberg's first feature film) and Dirty Mary Crazy Larry both came out in 1974. There's also a helicopter chase here, just like inVanishing Point(also 1971), and indeed the climax bears more than a passing similarity to that classic existential film.Peter Fonda is radiant at times, but I hated Susan George. Couldn't stand her stupid smirking shrieking blonde head, equal parts Suzanne Somers and Shelley Duvall. Vic Morrow was probably the high point for me. Sad to see him spend most of this film in a helicopter, considering what happened almost ten years later.Rating: Somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. Not as good as any of the films mentioned above.Dueland the originalGone in 60 Secondsare other groovy period chase flicks."
2,Another Me-Too book,"It really ticks me off when publishers (in this case Que) slap a new label on an old book and call it new. ... This is indeed a Flash 5 book (as another reader mentioned - I wish I would have read their comment before I bought this book). Nothing in this book relates to MX at all.As far as a Flash 5 book, it's nice to have a games-specific book - altough it really is padded with a lot of non-flash information that can be read anywhere (i.e. video game history). Although decent, nothing special jumps out at me. It taught me nothing new from the other books on Flash I have. If this is the first Flash Book you're buying, the visual ""Teach Yourself Visually"" books are probably a better bet (ISBN 0764536613); if you already have Flash books, then this will probably teach you nothing new. It's a pass on both accounts.Que - shame on you. I don't plan on buying any more of your books if these are the games you play."
3,Don't buy if you want to know how to make your own games,"This book is good, but there are two problems :- it is for flash 5, the code is very inefficient and not adapted at all to actionscript 2. I knew it earlier, I did not buy this book.- you won't learn how to create your own games. You will learn how people used to make games with old actionscript. The author does not teach how to organize your code to create a game, it teaches how he did his own old games.This book will teach you some actionscript code in a pleasant way anyway. But it is not clear, architectured, and up-to-date code.If you are a programmer and want to learn Actionscript, don't buy this book. Buy Macromedia Press ""Actionscript 2"".If you are not a programmer, and want to see how it can work, get some clues, then this book might be for you. But it is an old book."
2,Strange fit,"Warm and waterproof, but the fit is a bit strange. Size of the stocking part is also odd, not all women who need a larger wader due to the size of their behind wears the same size shoe as bigfoot."
3,Made a Good Gift - although value is in question,"This is a nice gift to give a young man with a sense of humor. Glenn O'Brien has a type of humor that is easy to get used to and he's put together a ""manners"" book for young men."
5,An eye opener,"Any writer struggling; do yourself a favor, and read this powerful book! The author is also a professional therapist, and his insights--priceless!"
5,Not just for fiction writers,"I am an assistant professor and this book helped me get over writer's block on my academic research. The fear, self-doubt, and all of the other psychological things discussed in this book are true for all writers. This is a must read for ANY WRITER, I assign it to my graduate students."
4,Hard Honky Tonk from the Female Perspective,"Charline Arthur burned brightly and briefly in the 1950s. Her style had rockabilly overtones but she was best doing hard core honky tonk and with a voice that ranged sweet to rough, she did a good job in typically male genre. Her career never really took off due to several reasons, but it wasn't because of the music. ""The Good with the Bad"" is my favorite cut, a ""talking"" song with a vocal that goes from normal to gutteral as she changes mood. If you like straight up honky tonk, check Charline out. You won't be disappointed."
1,How to build a smoking crater with H2,"As an engineer who both uses hydrogen and can work the math, I'm astonished that no one has corrected Peavey. He mixes units, get equations wrong and just plain can't spell. A decelerating engine is ""braking"" not ""breaking"", for example. His thermodynamic computations are often wrong once you work them out, his ""borrowing"" of other sources is painful where ""propane"" was not changed to ""hydrogen"" is all cases in a paragraph. Incredible. This text is very nearly the ""Anarchist's Cookbook"" of renewable energy -- there's a lot of words, some of it correct, but someone's going to get badly hurt if they actually follow this guide. All that, and a decade out of date to boot. If Amazon would take the book back, I'd gladly send them the ashes from the woodstove."
1,Poorly written college paper in form of cheap book,"This is an old college technical paper, put together to look like a book.It is very poorly written, but probably technically correct.The book jumps around with no particular sequence or direction.If you are not an electrochemical engineer in training who likes really bad diagrams ( bordering on hand written ) and REALLY TERRIBLE photographs ( which look like somebody's 3rd pass Xerox copies of twenty five year old black and white photos ) you will not like this book.It may be of assistance to a engineering student, who may need some of the obscure tables and reeeeally bad graphs.It looks like this guy printed this on a Commodore 64, in his basement,,,, him self,,,,, twenty years ago!!!!!!!The technical knowledge is there, but the book is a REEEEEALLY out of date, poor quality, and a piece of CRAP.But it's a great buy if you are looking for the spark gap setting for a 1977 Cadillac running a hydrogen conversion kit on a gasoline engine!"
3,Must laminate and cut out cards,"Be prepared to have to laminate, cut and store the cards yourself. It would be helpful if this information is included in the description."
4,good learning cards,recieved these in a couple days and they are very helpful for what we needed them for so good product
2,Was not really what I wanted,"The cover is scary enough and looked like some scary haunting stories but it was actually a mixture of differenct types of programs. I did not like the first episode ""Ghost Lab"", which like many others trying to be like the ""Paranormal State"".Some stories were re creation from the real story, but combination of this and the paranormal hunting episodes were simply mis match.I have to be careful next time, to read the reviews and contents before I purchase to avoid getting what I am not completely satisfied with."
5,1962?!,"Paul Bley had recently launched Ornette Coleman et al. into their (relatively) near-earth orbit, and here he and Don Ellis take things considerably further out. Ellis sounds both classically informed and rooted in swinging-jazz history, and you can hear him already playing around with microtonal smears that look forward to the 4-valve quarter-tone trumpet he played a few years later. He plays all kinds of stuff that would sound fresh today if played by somebody like Dave Douglas. Pretty impressive in the context of 1962!"
2,Glad that I did not buy this audiobook,"I really enjoy Fern Michael's books, but this was a real disappointment. When Annie starts to make money, why did she not just return the money? Why keep it in the first place? I guess it is supposed to keep readers interested, but it did not work for me. And putting the money in the washing machine to get rid of the fingerprints?! I got to disc 3 and can listen no more. Back to the library it goes."
2,Is this a bootleg?,"Bought this dvd for a girls wknd. The sound was horrible, sometimes loud and sometimes like they were talking in a muffled tin can on two of the movies, and one kept freezing then skipping ahead. Im really bummed cuz these are cute movies but we couldn't watch them all the way thru. The shipping was very timely."
4,Good but needs more dialogue,"This is a wonderful addition to the SW universe. I am glad we finally learn about Corellia. It sounds like the beginning of a good trilogy. My only dislike is the lack of dialogue. The character most accurately prtrayed is Lando, it would be just like him to marry for money."
3,Classroom Text,The book is a required classroom text. It gives basic information without any depth or exploration of subject matter as do most High School Text Books.
1,"No good, serious design flaw","Although the quality of the item is fine, and it is light and compact, there is one rather serious design flaw that stops me from using it... the part of the capo that makes contact with the back of the neck is too short, and also is flat and not curved. Therefore, it meets the neck in such a way that it seems very likely to dig into the neck and dammage the guitar."
5,Great Capo,"Planet Waves NS Classical Guitar CapoThis is a well made device and works perfectly. Thumb screw makes easy and quick set up. Holds well across all strings. For those of you who haven't tried a capo on your classical, it's neat to change the the sound of pieces you routinely play by just moving the capo and playing in a higher key. One note as mentioned before. It's for your classical. Won't work on narrow necks."
5,great capo - Planes Waves NS,"I have used the one-handed Kyser clamp-style capos (I think mine are from Dunlop) for a few years now and always been disappointed with the intonation problems caused by such a tight clamp. This Planet Waves NS capo has excellent intonation because the pressure can be adjusted just right with the thumb screw. The facts that it's so lightweight and stays out of the way of my fretting hand are just icing on the cake. I have not tried a Shubb capo, but I see no reason to bother with any other capo than the NS given its performance alone. And, it's pretty inexpensive to boot."
5,The best capo ever!,"This elegant looking capo is slim and simple to use. Just place it againts the guitar neck and crank it down gently untill the strings are depressed enough. I can't think of this thing going wrong. It's extreamly light weight like it's hardly even there. There is one gripe I do have about it. It did get in the way of my index finger trying to do a Em chord one fret higher, but I think it's true with all capos that they'll eventually get in they, but I doubt anything out there is as slim and out of the way as this one."
2,Buy the heavy one,"The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings I want more pressure, I advise getting the NS Capo that is not ""lite"", I prefer that one above this model."
1,Must have changed somehow.,"I received my capo last week after having used a friends and being very pleased. It was being used on a Squier Classic Vibe Custom Telecaster which has a pretty thin neck. I liked being able to dial in exactly to the point of playability without having to worry about tuning issues found on other capos.However, when I received mine and set to work attaching it to my guitar, I noticed it was much more stiff than the one I had used previously. Right as it got to what I felt was a proper tension, the arm snapped in half. Needless to say, I was not amused. Now I have spent money on a product that failed on it's first use. I like the design and hope that maybe mine was a fluke. But it would seem that the manufacturing process has changed. Good luck on the draw if you decide to purchase one of these for a guitar with a thinner neck. I'm sure it would be fine on a thicker neck."
3,VERY THIN,AS SOON AS I TOOK THE SHEETS OUT OF THE PACKAGE I COULD TELL HOW THIN THEY ARE AND I MEAN THIN! THEY WORK I GUESS BUT COULD PROBABLY BE TORN EASILY AND NOT SURE HOW MANY WASHINGS THEY ARE GOING TO LAST THROUGH.
2,You get what you pay for,"I knew when I purchased these sheets for only 13 dollars they weren't going to be great, but really these are ridiculous. They are incredibly thin sheets and they pill easily. They also do not stay on my mattress, I am constantly having to put them back on. I will not purchase these sheets again."
3,get what you pay for,"I ordered a full size set and the fitted sheet is way too big, it has elastic on 3 and a half sides and had a spot that was darker then the rest must have been a die issue. I don't recall if it came that way or if it happened after i washed it. ordered two other sets for family and they didn't say anything about itThe fabric feels wonderful!! great summer sheets"
2,Sheets,They are really thin for summer they will work but you have to change them often and the stiching on one pillowcase fell apart after the first washing.
3,These sheets are just OK,I had to laugh when i opened these sheets. I have to agree with the person that said they were like sheer curtains. thats exactly the way i would describe these sheets. You can not hide the fact that these are cheeply made. they are nowhere near worth 50.00. however they weren't that bad to sleep on and i'll keep them as back up sheets.
2,Not really what I expected,"The items were delivered in a timely manner, but the quality of the product was not a good as I expected"
3,a cheap option but looks great,"I bought this sheets for a beach apt and they are just fine, if you look for a thicker sheet you better consider another option"
1,Pilling after only one wash,"These sheets are very thin. Not very fitted- several inches too wide and a bit short on queen size mattress. The material bunched up at night, and have to basically remake the entire bed daily.After one washing the bottom sheet is unusable as it is very pilled and quite itchy because of this.Would not purchase this product again."
2,Soft but too thin,I liked the touch and feel of these sheets. They are so thin you can see through them clearly.
1,OK but will not buy again!,"I would like to give this 5 stars but I cant. They feel good, dont fit very well keeps sliding of the corners of the bed. Will not buy this brand again ."
3,Good And Bad....,"Good Price...Washes Well, Drys WellI rate Bad in being Too Thin...and Different Feel because not 100% cotton."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!,Absolutely the worst sheets I have ever bought! I cannot believe how anyone could like these sheets unless they just have very low standards. This was by far the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon - DON'T LET THE LOW PRICE TEMPT YOU: THEY REALLY ARE THAT BAD AND THE PRICE IS WAY TOO HIGH!!!!!!
5,Disney rock's,"I love disney. I loved it since I was 2 years old now I'm 11.Here are my ratings:Why Not (Mcmix) - Hilary Duff 5,5 i'm not a mutch Hilary duff fan but this song is perfact for her.Can't Help Falling In Love - A*Teens 5,5 Really beautiful evan better than Elvis ;)Dig It - Tent Boys 2,5 don't recemend it :(Drama Queen (That Girl) - Lindsay Lohan 5,5 LOVE THIS SONG!!!Grazing In The Grass - Raven 3,5 it's okHappy Together - Simple Plan 4,5 i love simple plan and this song =)The Tide Is High (Get The Feeling) - Atomic Kitten 4,5 kinda pointless but it works on meCinderella - The Cheetah Girls 4,5 the chors is not goodSupergirl - Kyrstal Harris 6,5 LOVE ITBeauty And The Beast - Jump5 5,5 A perfact remixUltimate - Lindsay Lohan 10,5 I love it my fav on this cdKeepin' It Real - Shaggy 1,5 NO NO NOSuperstition - Raven 3,5 it's fineWelcome - Jump5 3,5 nothing imoptantMiracles Happen - Myra 10,5 ahhh....It's perfact !!!"
2,Should Have Stuck to Straight Documentary,"I was looking forward to seeing this DVD, thinking that it would be a straight historical/archeological documentary. And indeed, it did have all the elements of such documentaries - computer reconstructions, expert commentary, etc. Unfortunately, the makers of this DVD must have thought that this was not sufficient, and they also included scenes that were more like historical dramas or vignettes of Hittite kings and queens. Since so little is known about these people, this was stretching the story way beyond the available material, and frankly seemed just silly."
5,Otherworldly,"This is the most radical, experimental album from Milton's great years. Don't expect great, singable songs (of course there's the title track, and ""sacramento), but rather haunting ambiances, jungle cries, children's chants, hummed prayers, and even a bar pianist's despair playing to a noisy crowd. It's cinemascope motion pictures for your ears: extremely innovative, and extremely intense.5 stars:definatively, as this ressembles nothing that ever has been done, even by Milton himself."
4,Fits great. Happy with it!,"This took a little over a week to receive, but worth the wait. After reading the other reviews, I wondered if it would fit our iron-board, which we've had for almost 20years. No worries though! It fit perfect, like a glove. It even had two riveted holes at the base to 'hook' onto 2 small pegs under the board (I didn't even know they were there). It's nicely padded, but still folds up easily. Very pleased with this purchase."
3,Just okay,"Although I was able to use this, it did not come with tie downs of any kind. I had to go buy clips, and they didn't work really well. I plan to keep looking, but will use this cover in the meantime."
1,Missing parts,"I was disappointed with Homz over-the-door ironing board when I ordered it, the parts did not work so I had to improvise with some wire to make it work. The reviews, thankfully, warned about the thin cover so I ordered an additional cover. Imagine my surprise when a second item from this same company came without the proper parts to make the product work. It has grommetts but no straps to keep the cover on. I give it credit that it is thick but now I have to buy something to tie it on with to make it work. I'll never purchase Homz on-line again."
5,managing girls can be such a challenge,Abigail thinks she has her own life under control (in a sense) and she's concerned with her sister and niece. What a challenge however and of course there has to enter a man with a scandalous past.
1,Not what I ordered,I did not receive the cable I ordered. IT did not match the picture of the cable I ordered either. I have to conclude that this company is not reliable.
3,using divorce mediation,I had to recently read this book due I was going threw this at the time with my ex/s very good book alot of tips and how tho handle situations.
5,good book,bought this for a class i was doing independantly. it is an older edition (the class required edition 3) but i finished the coursework with no problemwould recommend to anyone
2,Not bend-resistant,Quality product as far as wire shielding or wire center conductor goes. Bending behind the connector will eventually end up as a short. The dielectric cannot standup to repeated bends. the fix is reinforcing coax at the back of the connector. Use a few layers of electrical tape as I did or a couple layers of shrink tubing. After the fix was in place I have had no problem under daily use.
3,Easel review,We love the easel and have enjoyed writing on the dry erase board.The only problem is then the markers go on the wood it does not wash off and leaves it marked up.
4,Great for the Grandkids,"This app I got for the grandchildren so the do like it, It is easy to use and they have fun creating pictures."
1,Useless,"I bought this keypad because I don't like using the num lock option on my notebook. Using this thing is the same, you need to activate num lock on your notebook in order to use the numbers (if not the keys will work like home, end and their other functions), so you can't really enjoy using a full alphabetic keyboard AND an additional numeric pad. I tried it in both Vista and XP notebooks, didn't work either way."
3,Dissapointing,i was really looking forward to this cd seeing how i thought VAC was gonna go bankrupt after hex angel. but now this just makes me feel even more uncertain about vac's future... this cd isnt really worth getting if you have their other releases.. why? let me show you why..songs the die hard fans most likely already have..decypher remix 1decypher remix 2dial 8 remix 1dial 8 remix 2the hopelessthe deadwith that already being half of the cd.. well the other half is almost as useless unless you dig remixes... the futile remix is the best track on here while the rest dont seem to impress me that much. maybe i am just too picky.. but i was expecting more from bryan. he claims on his site that he will be releasing 3 more of these cds this year.. however i wouldnt count on those other ones unless this one sells good. basically it comes down to this.. i dont reccommend this cd unless your a die hard vac fan like me.. otherwise there really isnt anything worthwhile here in my opinion
3,Just so so,"The small jars of green olive tapenade were okay but nothing special in my opinion. Trader Joe's and other stores carry better, tastier tapenades."
4,Textbook Clavell,"Gai-Jin takes us back to Japan after the thriller Shogun, but with a cherry on top. Clavell combines characters that descend from the two previous books in Japan of 1862. For fans of the Asian saga, Gai-Jin fits right in.Some complain of the latter half of the book and the ending without a major climax. I don't agree. It's just Clavell's style. There's really no need for a major happening in the final pages since the entire book is filled with climaxes."
4,"Not Shogun, but still a fascinating read.","It's true that this is one of Clavell's weaker works, but it still surpasses most modern literature. This book contains all of his stylistic nuance and a captivating plot, although his characters are somewhat less lovable than those in his other works. Nevertheless, this book is requisite for anyone who loved Clavell's other works and still a great read for everybody else."
2,Not Shogun,"Very disappointing. Anyone looking for Shogun II, can't help but be let down. Kind of a hard act to follow.I especially didn't like the way the main protagonist was treated. Why he chose to do that to him half way through the book is a mystery to me.Don't waste your time"
1,Disappointing!,"A big fan of Clavell, I was thoroughly disappointed with Gai-Jin. This novel does not hold up to the other books in the Asia Saga. Although Noble House was one of my favorite books and I usually enjoy Clavell novels, it was an effort to finish this book. Clavell does a fine job recreating ancient Japan (I know, I lived there for many years) and the character development is sound.The problem is the reader never knows who to root for and the ending is a letdown. There are a few wonderful twists that truly surprised me and I couldn't put the book down through the first 500 pages, but the story went downhill from there and fell flat."
3,Long & Painful...,"I have read the first 2 books, Shogun and Tai-pan and this is definitely the least best of the 3 so far. Not just that, but man it's long...it could have been so good too.Seems like we'd spend 100 pages leading up to something, only to have it figured out and counter played by another character and nothing happens. This happened over and over...drove me nuts.The book ends and after you think about it...thing really happened...it was just 1230 pages of, nothingness...Gonna take a break from this series and live life again"
3,No product,The book was discontinued but I was promptly notified and refunded. I have no complaints with the seller.
4,From riches to rags,"A fifty two year old art professor much less attractive than lustful finds himself in a reality of post-apartheid South Africa as his white daughter submitted to group-sex with Afro-men to secure her independence from a native Euro-ghetto by doing own farming.It is a sharp ""Alice in wonderland"" picture where yesterday superman is a nonentity for past outcasts commending his life today."
5,SCREWED UP,"WHAT CAN BE SAID ABOUT PREFECTION, OF COURSE YOU NEED THE WHOLE JIG SYSTEM TO GET THE FULL USE OF THE PRODUCT"
1,***CAUTION ITEM IS NOT AS ORDERED***,I received an item completely opposite of which I ordered. I needed it to delivered quick because I live overseas and then when I finally got what I was waiting for it was ALL WRONG. +++DO NOT BUY+++
4,A go-to book for reading issues in the classroom,"I have used this book for several classes beyond the course that I was required to purchase it for. It was a great reference for research in my capstone course, and has been a go-to book for issues in my classroom."
2,ehhhhhh,Worked for the first week or two but after that not so much. I am switching back to stacker 2.
5,Caffeine Addict Here!,"I love these pills! I pop one right after I wake up and then go work out. You just can't beat the price either.A word of caution though: these things will get your bowels moving-----especially in the morning-----so wait at least 30 minutes before beginning exercise/driving to work and let at least an hour pass after a meal before taking one.This is just an energy supplement. As far as fat-loss goes, these simply aren't in the same category as the old ripped fuel (and other supplements) that had ephedra in em."
1,Are they serious?,"The makers of this highly UN-informative documentary are simply hoping to sell copies of it to those who can't get enough of The Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. It is a poorly done production consisting of a series of interviews with a guy who suppossedly knows alot about pirates. Anyone with a mild interest in pirates likely already knows most of what is offered here. There truly is nothing of significant interest here. No interesting artifacts shown. No real changes of scenery either ... just interviews taking place against a boring backdrop. I was stunned. I kept thinking, ""Are they serious? Are they actually selling copies of this rubbish?"" Seriously folks, I am not one to bash the efforts of others, but this is not worth your money or your time. Until a better documentary is made, read a good pirate book instead."
4,Great read,"Ms. Harrold has done quite a wonderful job as a first time author and I look forward to much more. Historical fiction and non-fiction is a personal favorite of mine, and this book didn't let me down. Rose Doyle's pluck and courage, at a time in history when women were nothing but chattel, kept me turning the pages. Jim Hawk's determination and chivalry was heartwarming, but his attitude toward women was admirable, given the period in history about which this book was written."
4,10 lines shine,"Hank Lazer's ""Days"" is a collection of poems that may be read in a short sitting. The structure is that of a ten line poem (with only few variations) in which Lazer explores facets of language in a day-to-day, journal-like style.The subjects are wide-ranging, often involving jazz or baseball, therefore the specifics might make this poetry somewhat inacessible to readers. But Lazer is a craftsman with sounds and shapes of words, and the combinations achieved are impressive.Additionally, this book is a good example of modern poetry that is easily studiable and discussable."
2,NOT worth the price,"I am a student of Opera and Voice Performance. This set sure looks nice, is high quality, and has many pictures. The CD's play OK, too. However, the historical background provided is not the most thorough or accurate for that matter. The audio for each Opera is not outstanding. You are better off purchasing a DVD of each Opera (you will also save money). I guarantee you. If you want to learn music history, buy a used, old textbook. It is more accurate than this poorly written text. To top it off, this product has no re-sale value. Not worth what it costs."
1,still haven't recieved it,"I never recieved the book. I wrote the seller and they said they would immediatly replace it, but I still haven't recieved it. Very dissappointed."
5,A treasure chest of ideas for kids and adults alike.,"This book brings home size -- large and small. It makes those pesky zeros seem significant. It interested my Barbie-loving daughter in numbers, at last! It gets the microscope off the shelf and the telescope out of the library! More fun than video games."
1,Mess-Free? Are they kidding?,"Using the Color Wonder Finger Paints is basically like dipping your hand in Vaseline. It's greasy, hard to wash off, and stains. I would never buy this again nor for anyone else. I strongly urge against purchasing this product. Crayola, shame on you!"
5,Beating the cowbell,One of the best companions if you're busting out the cowbell. The ridges offer you another sound other than just hitting it. Nice and thick for an easy grip.
2,didn't last very long,"due to (possible alcohol fueled) enthusiastic beating, this puppy broke on it's second day of use. luckily we were able to find a temporary replacement, but I had hoped it would last a little longer."
4,great matching stick for the cowbell,"This arrived in great condition, in a timely manner and I can't wait to take it to the next drum circle."
1,Going Natural,"First time I used this product I gave it a 4 star review but unfortunately when I attempted to use it for a second time after a month, the color did not take. Therefore, I am changing my first review to 1 star."
2,Cannot Rate,I sent this product back. I picked the wrong color based on the product reviews. I reordered in light brown.
1,Huge disappointment...,"I've know about henna and used it before in the past. It is well known for its amazing shades and therapeutic effect on hair. I got Surya Henna Strawberry Blond. Of course I was not expecting to see a salon quality hair color, but maybe a slight difference in the shade.My beautiful strawberry blond hair turn dirty brow/gray and root did not get touched by the color at all.Please do no waste your money and time. If you decide to use henna as hair treatment please go with colorless."
4,"Nothing wrong with it, but boring","Good insights, pretty good writing. I read a few pages every morning for a few months. It was nice, but nothing great. I say skip it. Be an adult and read A Course In Miracles."
1,"Beware, company sends unwanted product",Buy the firm and you will be sent a large number of unordered videos along with unordered vitamins. BEWARE.
1,paperweight for mac users,"I gave this one star, because it does work nicely in Windows. However, the company has been very misleading in its list of supported platforms and applications - and if you browse their forums you'll see what I mean - all the inquiries and problems go unanswered. This is why ultimately - this very expensive paper-weight deserves only 1 star. They've been misleading people for over a year and a half now with the dangling carrot of true mac support - but it still hasn't come. Finally Cinema 4d 11 will allow the knob to work - but none of the buttons work - no short cut keys - nothing - so it really does become useless."
4,Fast and Fun,"This is the type of light sweep me into someone elses problems book I love when I am overwhelmed. Boy was I glad I did not have Lou's life, at least until she got Jack!This was really cute and fast paced. The dialogue was snappy and refreshing, I really enjoyed it and will be reading future books by this author. I can not wait for Lou's brother Nick's story!!!!"
4,Sketcher shoes,"I am impressed with the puctuality, price of the shoe and would be happy to buy them again."
1,Great title but doesn't deliver,This book gave more info about pots and pans and knives then about kitchen planning. It had a few diagrams of the authors kitchen but no other info on how to design a different configuration or any configuation for that matter. A complete waste of money.
1,COPY COPY COPY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie was SO coped of cars. It make me so so so so so SO MAD!!!!!!!!!!!! I really liked the movie cars and I was very MAD to see it coped like this. The whole movieis way to short. And no real plot just a bunch of cars TALKING. So exciting. Do not get this movie!!!! It's nothing but a ripoff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Poor Mnfr. customer service,"I purchased the Nail Genie Professional a couple years ago. I loved it, as I do my own acrylic nails at home. After a couple of years use, it stopped spinning. My husband took it apart and a very small plastic gear part (maybe 1/4"" diameter) broke in half. I contacted the mfr. Sunjeen, Inc. to inquire on getting the replacement part. They do not sell internal parts and told me I would have to buy the entire handle for $56! Not no, but hell no! I've researched online and there are Dremel's that have the same capability as the Nail Genie. The Dremel I purchased cost me less than the $56 for their damn handle!"
5,great product,This is a great product. It sure helps you do your ownnails at home. It helps you have that professional lookto your nails.
4,love it,"not being able to buy the original(discontinued) battery operated (AA type) nail genie, I finally bit the bullet and bought this product. It took some getting used to as it is much more powerful than my battery hand held model, but once I got the hang of it, I like it a lot. It's great for nails and feet and does wonders on calluses on your feet and heels."
2,Defeated By Bad Writing,"This premise could have been good, but it was brought down by lousy scripting. The animation was of a high level, like ""Reboot,"" & the voice work was stellar. Patty Jausoro was a producer on this and is great with animation... as well as other things."
3,Good comedy,"If you were heavy into video games in the late '80s and early '90s, then you'll understand and enjoy this series. I liked it when it was first on and never understood why it didn't last. Unlike many shows, it was funny without becoming vulgar, cute without becoming sickening."
1,Bad quality,"I didn't like the quality of this product, since the cap and the bottle was separated. They won't be closed tight together. Originally, I was going to order something else, but now, no."
5,"Super cute, and amazing quality!",It looks great in my back window and is adorable. The fact that the hello kitty wiggles is super cute!
3,Why can't anyone hear me on this thing?,"After reading lots of good reviews, I decided to buy another cordless phone. I've never been fond of the Uniden brand and I see why. I've had the phone barely a week and I can't hear callers well and they can't hear me either. I gave it 3 stars for looks & price only."
3,Good vs Bad,"Good- price, reception, and features.Bad- scroll down pad stops scrolling down, this happened on this product and also my additional hand set bought seperatly."
1,uniden purchase,The wrong power cord was sent for the main base and I had to purchase one additionally at extra cost and shipping. Not too happy with this one. I only hope it works works when charger gets here.
2,Chinese New Year Book,"I was disappointed by this book. Every year I host a chinese new year party and I am always looking for some more ideas so I ordered this book. I was hoping for an idea or two. There is notmuch at all to this book just a couple of pages maybe 20 total. There is little ""substance"" to this book. I bought this book for $8.95. The price tag should have been $2.95. Live and learn I suppose."
4,Perfect for fall themes,This is the book to use when launching your fall themes. Every fall I read this book. The children listen intently and are drawn to the bright vivid colors. They love to predict and actively participate in the word patterns. There are so many lessons that you can use from this one book.
2,Cami Lace review,"I ordered every color of the cami lace insert. I was a little disapointed that the first time I tried it, the cami lace piece wasnt long enough to cover over my bra. I wasn't able to use any of them.I am thinking of using them as appliques on another tank top and just sew them in permanantly. I hopes this helps. I wouldn't recommend buying them unless you plan on sewing them in also. They are akward to work with as they are."
3,Buena lectura mientras dura.,"Este es un clásico que había leído de niño y del cual me quedaron buenos recuerdos.Releyéndolo ahora veo que está a la altura de mis memorias. Tiene muy buena calidad de prosa y un ambiente de ensoñación mágica que hace acordar a algunas historias de Becquer y de las Mil y Una NMoches.El problema que encontré es que, al menos en mi caso, se corta durante el cuento ""Leyenda del Gobernador y del Escribano"". Lo he bajado a varios dispositivos y allí queda.Espero que en algún momento lo publiquen completo."
2,do not recomend,The movie was boring the acting was bad and story line was strange. Would not recomend only two sex scenes witch were stupid.
2,Disappointed.,"I picked this album up because of the good reviews it'd recieved. I was very disappointed on first listen.Very, very mopey.1. Crank HeartProbably the most listenable, best track. It's only a 3/5 in cheesiness.2. I Luv the ValleyFrench phrases thrown in at random. 4/5 cheesiness.5. Support Our Troops Oh! (Black Angels Oh!)A song about the war in Iraq. Soldiers are just ""stupid jocks."" Horrible, horrible, horrible. Lyrics will make you cringe. Squeaking sounds for a few minutes of the track. 5/5.6. Fabulous Muscles [Mama Black Widow Version]""Remake me,/ Before you come on my lips,/ Honey, Boy/ Place my ashes in a vase,/ Under your workout bench."" Slow tempo.

5,Great summer read!,"This has been an enjoyable book. I've liked a lot of Susan Wiggs' books, and this one did not disappoint. I took it on a recent trip to the beach, and it was fun reading while enjoying the sun and surf!!"
5,A World War Two Eye in the Sky,"Certainly this is not a book for everyone, but I have a considerable liking for aerial photographs. I like the unconventional perspective such photographs give to places and events. Algred Price's ""Targeting the Reich: Allied Photographic Reconnaissance Over Europe, 1939-45"" provides a succinct text overview of British and US aerial reconnaissance techniques and technology, but the main focus of the book is the more than 150 photographs taken during reconnaissance missions, startling in their clarity and drama. We see bombing raids in progress, Nazi warships and airfields, camouflaged factories, V-1 launch sites ... Some of the photographs display what I can only call artistic merit, especially those with features casting sharp, dark shadows or those with extraordinary patterns of water wave action or land tracks. The terror and destruction of war is transformed into a harsh beauty."
1,This is not an authentic Japanese flute sound,"I listened to the cd. My son played it in the cd player and it sounded like a European type of flute melody. As I viewd the CD I realized the flute palyer is not A Japanese, but a European. I sent it back to Amazon.You too will hear the difference."
2,nice book but boring through the half way point,"This book started off really nice, but halfway through you would be waiting for something exciting to happen or you could tell what would happen. The ending was soooooo corny and lame. i read the first two books in the series, but this book really puts to shame this series. talk about a way to make a good book terrible! Please take my advice, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Good for the absolute beginner,This is a great book for anyone with no experience programming or using Matlab. It is ideal for high school students and college freshman.
2,Utter Nonsense,"This book was not what I had expected. I went in thinking it was a story about a woman that lives through a nuclear war and eventually finds happiness. Yes, but that only happens in the last 15 pages or so. And that part is so breezily covered, it is absolutely ridiculous.The rest is portions of her life, in no particular order, filled with new age EST type claptrap, and farfetched relationships. A few of those portions are somewhat interesting, so the book isn't a total loss.My recommendation: Skip this one."
1,Don't bother,"I love Japanese horror as it so often blends a sophisticated story into some of the most frightening cinematic moments in the genre. This collection is slow, boring,very cheaply produced (all video-no film) and not in the least bit scary. It looks like a college project."
2,ZZZZZ,Wow. I read the previous reviews but I really did not want them to effect my reading so I went ahead and read the book. Big mistake. This was a really dry book and I really did not understand the love between the main characters. Normally I could read a book this size overnight easily however with this book I streched it for over a week all while I was enjoying much better written stories. Do not waste your time. Take advice from the other reviewers.
1,Rather boring,"I agree with one of the reviwers....this book is rather tiresome. The hero does not really have the qualities I prefer in a, well, hero, but he's quite okay. Now, the heroine is another different matter.... she's always in a sour mood, always snapping, always bad-tempered. A harridan. I got irritated with her. Very slow pace, long-winded - I found myself skipping pages, just to get to know the end."
4,Good Movie,"Enjoyed it, needed tissues by the end.The story was good and there was a good lesson in it. Would reccommend for over 12 though."
5,One of my Top 10 all-time favorite movies!!!,"Bring out a hankie or a full box of tissue... this inspiring, thought-provoking, and well acted film is a must for everyone. If only everyone really would just Pay It Forward..."
4,Solid morality play,"My daughter has raved about this for some time, I finally got around to watching it over this last holiday weekend. It's definately worth seeing, a good solid story, a bit sad, but well acted and the kind of movie that makes you think a bit.I don't think it's something younger children would really get into, there are a bit of adult themes running through this, however older kids will be able to get the brain juices flowing and that's a good thing.It's hard to go into the flick without giving something away, so I'll just say it's a bit of a Christology and worth seeing, there is some grown up drama shown, but it's a redemptive movie, inspite of the sad parts."
5,Good Watch,A very heart warming movie. A good watch for the whole family. My 9 year old boy had a few tears in his eyes. Not to many movies that you can sit with the family and watch.
5,"Great Movie, Beautiful Message","The ""Pay it Forward"" message in this film is what makes it beautiful.The cast in this movie fit perfectly into their roles. Helen Hunt did a good job of portraying the yucky, drunk, fake-blonde mother. Kevin Spacey did an excellent job as Mr. Simonet. Haley Joel Osment did an outstanding, touching job as Trevor. Yes, as many have said, he does play his roles seriously. However, that is what this movie calls for, and he's great at it.I must say that I enjoyed this movie until the last 3 minutes of it, during which I was in tears...the message of the film is that the world could be a wonderful place if everybody would ""Pay it Forward"", but that's not reality, not everybody is willing to ""Pay it Forward"". But, Trevor stated that by ""Paying it Forward"" you can ""change a person"", so they will someday ""Pay it Forward"".Do the world a favor, don't be afraid, Pay it Forward, it could work."
2,The Good Part Is In The Commercial,"A movie like this is based solely on the premise, not the story. The story just fleshes it out. Without giving anything away I can say that the acting performances here are the standard ones you'd get in any of these actors' movies. Kevin Spacey is very much like Keyser Söze, Helen Hunt was just like in As Good As It Gets, Haley Joel Osment might as well have been seeing dead people, etc. The only real acting surprise here was Jay Mohr, who usually plays a tool actually pulled off a great performance. My advice is to save your money, rent this movie or check it out at the library since the whole premise is given away in the movie and the acting isn't worth the money."
3,Heartbraking...,"It's heartbraking to give it 3 stars...but there you have it.""Pay It Forward""...a movie that inspires us to do the unthinkable for the world works on the premise that the world can be made over if we forward good deeds onward.Despite Osment's stellar performance, Spacey's bitterness, and Hunt's portrayal of a woman trapped in an abusive relationship, it just doesn't chalk up to a story that I like.Because everyone wins...sort of. Helen breaks her abusive relationship and Spacey gets over himself. Osment tragically dies. How about the REAL world: Helen's relationship spirals out of control, Spacey never reconciles his ""differences"" with the world, and Osment continues to dream unrequited wishes. I hate to say it and I know it sounds cynical, but that's what I find happening more often than not.Wonderful tearjerker...but let's wake up to the realities of life, everyone."
2,Great Premise---Overly Sentimental and Average Movie,"I really wanted to like this film. The director Frank Darabont was responsible for one of my all-time favorite films--The Shawshank Redemption. It features three outstanding actors--Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, Hayley Joel Osment. So why did it seem like such an unnecessary mess? I think all of the actors were badly miscast in this film and the film's promising premise gets lost in bad dialogue and a poor storyline. Too bad. A story of people trying to do good deeds for people they don't know is a great one. Overall, I think it's a waste of someincredible talent."
2,"Okay, but....","This was supposed to be an inspiring film about doing something good for other people (and telling them to do the same to others and so forth). It DOES start out promising enough, but it is too disjointed, too meandering and some confusing scenes (such as a drunk woman helping a brazen thief to flee from the cops...huh?! That's doing a good deed?) And what's more (spoilers warned!) the character Trevor (who came up with idea for ""Paying It Forward"" program) was killed at the end defending his friend from the bullies. How is it encouraging the viewers to step out and do the compassionate deed for others at risk of their lives? :/I'm sorry but I don't think it is really a very good movie, even with best performances that actors such as Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment gave."
5,Pay It Forward,Great family movie. I was happy I was able to find it at Amazon after seeing the movie on a TV late show I had to order it to share with my friends.
1,Buying this book is WASTING money.,"This book is not worth buying for the following reasons:1) The book fails to explain the concepts clearly.2) It is rather confusing and boring; the chapters on important concepts are not clearly laid out. It seems the author hasn't given sufficient thoughts to come up with a better work.3) The book is full of grammatical mistakes.4) It total, it is complete waste of money in my view. There are many other good ones out there in the market on Software Engineering.Thanks,A Software Professional"
3,Panasonic DVD Player and Recorder,"This product is good but only thing that I don't like it and I think it is design problem is, the remote control. The respond from the unit to the remote is very slow. Don't expect when you press the remote and the unit respond right away. This is the reason that I return the unit back after nearly 30 days of using it. It's ok at beggining but overtime, It realy bother me and decided to return this back to Amazon."
5,love it,I love this product! It's easy to use and very flexible. It was delivered promptly and without problems.
4,Very good rythems and in the Enigma style,"I really like this CD, as it it has very good rythem & beat to it. With an Asian flair to it.Very well done."
4,lean mean killing machines literally machines,"Hi my name is nick and I'm 11 i just recently got into manga and have only read about 7 so far but I already LOVE them. This out of the seven manga i read so far is my favorite it is darkly delightful with humor ,action and gloom this was very sad to read but i still enjoyed it my only complaint was they killed the robot girl i liked with a bullet to the brain *tears* the reason i gave it 4 and not five is the fact that is Really boring at some points and sometimes the action over powers the story and the story becomes pointless I'm highly anticapating volume 2."
1,Extremely poor workmanship,This vest is made of extremely lightweight cotton which surely would not withstand much use. The one I ordered arrived with several seams open (fabric wasn't cut properly) as well as thread from stitching not quite finished and hanging all over it. I couldn't return it fast enough. Save your money - this vest is complete junk and probably cost all of $2.00 to manufacture.UPDATE: I picked up the Domke PhoTOGS Vest (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009O8Q3A/) and it is about a thousand times better than this piece of garbage. Highly recommended.
1,pocket is sewn shut,I would like to return it. this sentence is to use up the fourteen words required by your email message board.
2,Humvee Safari,"Beware.; ""Heavy duty"" two way main zipper FAILURE after only 7 days. The main two-way zipper has very loose tolerances. Bottom zipper is almost impossible to align. Top zipper pulled off top stop."
4,Love the item,Like the item. Delivery took a little to long but once I got the item I can overlook that.Thanks!
4,Photographer's Vest,Epaulets are only functional for extremely narrow camera straps. They will not accommodate wide straps. Otherwise this is a well made and functional vest.
3,Be careful,"The vest is ok; however, it is not CampCo brand name. It is Humvee. I would rather receive what it is advertised. Maybe this is better than the one I intended to purchase, maybe not. I was kind of dissapointed and surprised to receive a different thing. I live outside the U.S. and a relative shipped it to me ... returning it is out of the question.If you buy from this company ... be careful."
3,Using the many of the same characters. . .,". . .as in his first novel, Bean crafts another psychological murder mystery -- but, like his first two, with some serious flaws.Again set in Southeastern Wisconsin, it is clear that Bean is reasonably familiar with the area. That is a plus. There are not many other plusses.The first victim? The mentor of his main character. Other victims? Like in his previous books, young children. Many readers may well have a difficulty with this aspect of the book. His ultimate villian was completely unbelievable, the motive was weak and the resolution non-existent.The sub-plot involving the gambling difficulties of the main character's husband never did make sense to me, and did not significantly add to the overall development.Certainly not the worst mystery writer I've encountered -- but certainly not the best either."
1,This garbage is NOT Bossa Nova!,"I ordered this hoping for some nice, authentic Bossa Nova renditions of Christmas classics. When I put it into the CD player, I was not just disappointed, but somewhat mad. This muzak is NOT Bossa Nova. It sounds like some computer geek got an old Casio PT-80, selected the Bossa Nova ""accompaniment"" and played. The ""horns"" are nothing more than cheesy synthesizer sounds. If you like low-budget cruise ship muzak, then this is for you. If you are looking for Bossa Nova, then look elsewhere."
5,Must Have!,"This book was used for both Business Practice For Interior Design & Sales and Marketing. I had no need to consult any other source. ""This is a great book"" THANKS.."
2,WHERE IS ANN RULE WHEN YOU NEED HER?,"Having read St. Martin's rush-to-press book, ""Breaking Point,"" as soon as it hit the stands, I was disappointed with O'Malley's long-awaited book about the Andrea Yates tragedy. Whereas Spencer interviewed relatives, friends, and acquaintances, O'Malley relied heavily on court transcripts and seemed to take a point of view from a telescope.The book about Andrea Yates that I want to read has yet to be written. For example, I want to know where she stored her pots and pans while she was home-schooling three children in a bus and ironing her husband's shirts so he'd look normal while working at NASA. I want to know why she didn't lose her mind earlier.As for Texas justice....We're talking about a state that found Andrea Yates to be as sane as the woman who hacked her ex-lover's wife to death with an axe in the 1980s. Only difference is, the axe muderess was found not guilty."
3,Somewhat Contrived,"This is my introduction to the Karp Ciampi series. I was not impressed. The story moves along pretty well. There were so many characters in the book, especially the people in the DA's office that I was often confused. Also the book had too many coincidents to be believable. On the other hand the story moved along. I will read the next book in the series at some point but it is not on the top of my list."
2,Opteka HD 77mm R72 720nm Infrared X-Ray IR Filter,Hot Spot in central part of the filter...the output is a little blurry.. you need to manually adjust the camera for best results...False colors are very difficult to fix once in photoshop or lightroom..Stick with the Hoya don't buy this junk. you're wasting your money period.[...]
3,Bird-X Gator Guard Alligator Head,"Delivery was FAST. The alligator head is ""okay"". Unfortunately, it sinks more than half-way in the water or tilting way over to the side. Time will tell if it helps keep the birds away."
1,VERY Inconsistent. Don't waste your money!,I bought this scale a few years ago thinking that it was good. I would always step on the gray rectangles and get different readings each time. I just did it about 3 times and never thought anything of it. Now that I'm serious about my weight loss (p90x) program I am noticing more and more that this scale is inconsistent. I can barely step on the gray rectangles and I would weigh heavier than I am. If I ignore the rectangles and put both feet near the middle I weigh less. I'm one month into my program and there is NO way that I only lost 2 pounds. Not when I can actually see I've been losing inches. So it's time to spend another $20-$30 dollars on a non-taylor scale. Yay! Not
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this scale a few months ago from a local Target and it worked fine at first, but after only a few weeks it would only say ""ERR"" whenever we used it. Thinking it may be an issue with the battery, I replaced it. It worked for a few days after that, but now it just stays blank when someone steps on it. It stopped working altogether. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. Taylor should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a terrible product."
5,awesome,these are real lacrosse balls not the fake foam ones; they are heavy rubber balls. Quick delivery I will definitely purchase from this seller again!
3,Lacrosse Ball for juggling,"As far as it may go for the sport of Lacrosse(which I don't play)it seems a fine product.However,I bought it for juggling,in particular,in using it in bounce tricks as I juggle.There is regrettably next to no bounce in this particular ball.I was hoping it would live up close to the Viceroy Canadian Lacrosse balls which were renowned with professional jugglers since the 30's,but which since have been discontinued.Oh well,my quest for the perfect juggling ball continues."
1,BEWARE!!! After a while it Stops Working!!!,I bought this charger and after probably 20 Uses it STOPPED WORKING!!!DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.. Batteries suck and Charger SUCKS even more!!
2,It was ok....,"You mean to tell me that in Chicago, there are only two black people per graduating class??? David Schwimmer makes an ok attempt at directing, but he directs like he acts...Like Ross Geller on Friends. On Friends there are no people of color in NYC and I guess the same is true in Chicago. I am a little tired of seeing this perpetuated in this industry. Liev Schreiber's dancing cop was terrific. There is one in every bunch. I give the two stars for Liev and Laura Flynn Boyle."
3,Since you've been gone,I like watching this movie--even though it's not as funny throughout the entire movie as the trailers would indicate.
3,Apathetic,"Having read all of Jim Grimsley's previous novels, I opened ""Boulevard"" with sweet anticipation. Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed.While Grimsley has perfected his character development in previous books, and has that whole southern storyteller thing down, I found ""Boulevard"" to be confusing and meandering. While the initial 100 pages are Grimsley at his best (drawing a deep and complex character in Newell), the introduction of the subsequent characters was distracting. By the time I got to page 200, I no longer cared what happened to Newell, or his innocence...or especially his newfound and somewhat sociopathic boyfriend.I would recommend any of Grimsley's previous works before touting this one."
2,"Comfortable, BUT.............","I'm on my second, but my last pair of these. The shoe is very comfortable but has two really bad flaws. The first is the back of the shoes. Despite not being hard on my shoes, the backs have worn to the point that the leather has split and the stuffing is literally protruding through. This happened to a previous pair and each shoe was fixed by the shoemaker with reinforced leather [...]. This gave them an additional 6-12 months of usage. Now the same thing is happening to this pair. I'm not going to fix this pair because of the second major problem with them, the shoes scratch and shed their color by almost looking at them. Yes, minimal abrasion or friction to them cause deep scratches or erosion to the shoes finish. This is unacceptable and therefore these shoes will be discarded when totally worn out and I will not purchase them again."
4,My daughter's favorite book so far (she's 4.5),"Fun book with a simple song. Took my wife and I awhile to get into it, but once you starting singing the book, it all makes sense. No fun to just read it any more."
5,"Excellent Recording, A Must for anyone looking to explore","The Tracks are all very soothing and short enough not to become dull to the western ear, as oriental music frequently is. There is only a single use of synthesized sound on one track that is somewhat annoying(I hate synthesizer) but the rest is flawless"
3,"Fatso "" good old italian movie""",I grew up on this movie and had to get it on dvd. tired of watching on vhs..i'm a dvd and blu-ray fan..couldn't take it anymore..big fan of this movie.
1,NOT FUNNY OR REMOTELY ENTERTAINING,"ONE NAME: DOM DELUISE. If this summation has no significance to you, carry on with watching that wet paint dry."
2,No Examples of Engineering resumes,"A well laid out and very descriptive guide but missing the critical resume example I was seeking. There are no examples of Engineering resumes. I found science and an entire chapter on writing IT (information technology) resumes, but no information on Engineering resumes. Engineers apply to department of defense agencies and the only comment the guide offered was that DoD agencies use the resumex system. The guide does not tell how to compose resumes for the resumex screening system. And if you are 'not' ex-military and applying in competition with those who are, the guide does not offer help in converting civiilian experience to appeal to the military agencies."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION,"UGH, why didn't I read the other reviews before I bought this edition? This book is FILLED with the most bizarre typesetting errors you can imagine, which makes it incredibly difficult to read. Sometimes you really do get only what you pay for. I will order another edition, but never again buy a book published by General Books LLC."
5,outstanding,"This was one of the most enlightening,informative andriveting books that I have ever read. The depth ofthe account of this families lifes throughout theholocaust is nothing short of amazing. Although thisis the first of Ms Hagstrom's works that I haveexperienced, I will certainly watch for more of herworks in the future."
4,A Compelling Story,"I've read many books about World War II and the Holocaust in the past. What made Sara's Children stand out was the power of the Garfinkels' testimony -- that the five survived and how they survived by helping each other. The story unfolded naturally. Thankfully, the author did not overdramatize an already dramatic story yet I did find myself caring about the Garfinkels and their fate. I was sufficiently impressed by this book to buy many copies of Sara's Children to give as gifts to friends and family."
5,Hitler Did Not Always Win,Anything regarding the Holocaust interests me so very much. It should never be forgotten. The research and confirmation of facts in Sara's Children were outstanding. The author's control of the English language is also outstanding.
4,Agree with the other two,I think the reason he does it is so he can say he is consistent at making the First Single off of every album sound funny compared to the other music. Only about 2 Funny songs on CD
3,Ho-hum,"Like many people, I feel that ""Nothing Fails"" was THE song from ""American Life"" and I was tickled pink when I found out that it was finally going to be released as a single. The original version is the best (hint hint...pick up ""American Life""!) and these remixes really do nothing for the song. I'd heard big things about Peter Rauhofer's mix, and it was a major let down when I actually got the hear just what everyone was talking about. The mix was tired, boring, and ""classic"" house. The only mixes I enjoy of the track are Jason Nevins' mixes. Both are fun, dynamic, and rad. The bonus mixes for ""Nobody Knows Me"" are really fabulous. I loved the song and I love all three mixes included on the single. Peter Rauhofer's is just an amped up club version of Madonna's original...which sounds fabulous. I was expecting big things from ""Nothing Fails""...which ulitmately didn't deliver."
4,How could they miss this typo?,"Another cd of Madonna remixes is a good thing, IMHO.Something of note, though, is the typo on the cover and back of the cd. The cover and the back contains the lyrics to the song overlaid on each other with diff. type sizes. There's a typo--""you silly thingz"""
3,Fabulous Costumes,"I anticipated the arrival of this DVD very much after I ordered it.Historically correct, with a few tweaks, this film gives a very insightful view of England's ""virgin Queen"".The film only captures a very short amount of the life of Elizabeth, and provides a very dry love story, but I must say that the costumes and make up in this movie are fabulous, fabulous.All in all, it was very entertaining, I'm proud to own the DVD, but I will probably only pull it out about once a year or so."
2,Wrong Region,"My DVD player is set for Korea. It won't play the DVD, it says ""check the region"".COuld I return it? But I really want this product - how can I get one for the right region?Thank you"
2,In a word? Overkill...,"The first Elizabeth installment was just fantastic - aside from that low-production-value BBC production 30 years ago, I'd never seen anything which presented the early, turbulent years of her reign.This, though, has been done. And recently, too! Helen Mirren just suited up and addressed the troops last year! And while the costumes and sets were beautiful, there was so much CG in the movie that I began to doubt that ANY of it was real!Disappointing..."
3,Better Than I Thought It Would Be,"Honestly, I had no intentions of watching Queen Elizabeth, The Golden Age. As with all historical accounts of this era, I had expected hours of violent crimes and fighting and lots of bloody events. But to my surprise, it was quite the opposite. It was, in fact, a story of romance and heartache.If you're interested in watching the film with your children, it would make a prelude to a discussion about loyalty, about truth, about honor, and even about abstinence. You could discuss the correct protocol when two friends fall for the same guy (or girl), you could discuss the importance of not manipulating or forcing someone to do what you want and the consequences that can take place, and you could discuss how, in the film, Bess became pregnant after only one encounter and how condemns and birth control pills are not 100 percent.I received a complimentary copy to review."
5,She is the best,"Magnificent, from the casting to the costuming. Cate Blanchett owns the Queen during this period!"
2,ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I enjoy watching Cate Blanchett usually, and enjoy historic movies and documentary type movies, but this one put me to sleep."
5,Great,Love this film and I love the how old films were made you don't get that quality in today's films great seller and buy
2,The sound doesn't match with the lips.,"I've always liked this movie. Price was good, delivery was good. Unfortunately, the sound is a little off which makes this not a good purchase."
4,Elizabeth: The Golden Age,The best of the two Cate Blanchett portrails of Elizabeth I. This one had move of a decent storyline and dramtics than the other. This is pretty much what I was taught at Oxford University during a course on Tudor History.I recommend this picture for anyone interested in Elizabeth and the Tudor era.
2,A let down,"After seeing the first film (Elizabeth), I expected much more from this film, and was disappointed. The action is abrupt to the point of jarring, and there are too many scenes where Blanchett just stands in a costume while the camera whirls around her. The photography and sets are excellent, but not enough to carry this pretentious and poorly executed flick. I'm sorry I wasted the money to rent it."
5,A Triumph of Film-Craft!,"Far superior to the earlier film by the same name; plot lines are tighter, costuming is eye-popping, and the tension between Blanchett's Elizabeth and Clive Owen's Raleigh is palpable. Historical inaccuracies aside, a great film!"
5,The QUEEN is DEAD in HD-DVD,"ELIZABETH:THE GOLDEN AGE is a great looking film and a must see for fans of British Royal history. Sadly, with the death of HD-DVD, this disc may not get the widespread circulation it deserves. Universal will probably re-release this title on Blu-ray, but no date is set yet. Overall, this HD-DVD release is worth getting if you still have an HD-DVD player."
4,California Tan Bronzer,Great product. Works very well. Came on time. Prompt shipping. Was exactly what I ordered and I appreciate that very much. If you don't like the bronzers that sting then you'll love this product because it delivers a beautiful smooth deep tan without stinging the skin. Thanks so much!
5,A classic for any age,This was a gift for my niece. The adults in the room enjoyed it as much as she did.
3,Great Story but Poor Illustration,"For a childrens book I didn't like the black and white illustrations. The only color they used was green (for the oobleck), but children like colorful pictures to look at. Great story though."
5,"Scotty, you've done it again!",I have used this book since it was first published and have found it to be wonderful. I encourage everyone to buy it.
2,Better chargers out there for same price.,"There are 4 slots in this charger, and you cannot charge one battery at a time, it has to be 3 or more batteries. It takes 6-8 hours to recharge the batteries! There are far better chargers out there for the same price as this."
1,Waste of money!,"I bought this item which came with 2 batteries to charge come to find out you must fill the unit in order to charge. So I had to buy more rechargeable batteries in order to use this product. Then I find out the unit doesn't work period. I tried to return it but once the package is open it cannot be returned. I called Energizer and basically they told me they were ""sorry"" but there's nothing they could do and they could not refund any of my money. I wish I had just spent the money on regular batteries!"
1,out dated,"Well, this is a book for and from the previous millennium ; talks about A:/fdisk ; disks smaller then 512 Mbyte. Pages all about IDE-hard disk, their connectors with photographs and all; in short : out of time."
4,OBIE DID A GOOD JOB.,"THIS IS THE FIRST OBIE TRICE CD, I'VE PURCHASED. I AM PLEASED WITH IT. HE HAS A UNIQUE STYLE. I WILL CONSIDER BUYING MORE IN THE FUTURE."
5,Banging,This album is of the chainzzz Obie did his thing since i bought this album its have neever leave my car cd player all the songs are banging love the skits cant wait for the third album
3,the cd is ok,"nothing great here must say it sounds a little better than year of the dog but not as good as the day after. to be honest i'm just so bored with 50, em & trice the whole crew it's just so comercial now nothing diffrent than pink. i didn't buy this cd a friend gave it to me, i don't think it was worth his effort trying to sell it. it's not that bad but once you heard the day after evrything seems weak that's out at the moment."
2,"I liked it ok, but I wished it had been longer.","I liked ok. The way it is is good, but the #1 thing, that i think, that would probably make it better was if they went from Starrcade 1983 to Starrcade 1998. If this would've taken place, I would have given it 5 and a 1/2 stars!!!!"
2,"Nice descriptions of places, but characters are stilted","I read the author's book ""Reservation Road"" and was blown away by it. This book was a big disappointment and I had to force myself to complete it. Having spent some time living in Japan, I enjoyed the descriptions of daily life, which are vivid. However, the characters seem to be pieces on a game board who are moved around artificially without motivations that ring true. Alternately the main character is thuddingly dull, or maddeningly self-involved. The characters around him are all very one-note, particularly the young women who seem to exist only for his pleasure. Read ""Reservation Road,"" which is outstanding, and avoid this earlier effort at all costs."
4,"Same ol, Same ol","The only reason why I didn't give Specter of the Past a perfect ten is because nothing very different is happening in this book, for example Zahn is using the same old ""Empire is crumbling, and New Republic faces one last threat from the Empire"" baseline. But all in all Zahn has another great book that is well worth reading."
5,Bravo!,"Thankfully, this book once again blesses readers with Zahn's excellence. We were reintroduced to the world of Star Wars with his Heir to the Empire Trilogy -- an excellent beginning, and the works that followed his were simply of lesser quality. It's quite refreshing to read a Star Wars tale worthy of the name, the ""myth"", and the original stories."
4,Good but not as good as the first three.,"This was a good story with some particularly good characters, Major Tierce,Pelloeon and Talon Karrade for instance with some good action scenes but unfortunatly I cannot help but compare it with his first three novels so I do not belive it is as good although it is not bad and worth 4 stars but it is missing the ace character and that is Thrawn and it would also be nice if the Empire won for once. I must also say though that Timothy Zahn is the best writer on Star Wars with great characters."
2,Not even a part of a series,"I was very disapointed with Timothy Zahn - I expect much more. The book is well written but would only serve as a great introduction to a novel. In his first trilogy, he has some kind of wrap up to each of the first two books, but the reader knows that more is coming, and needed, to finish the story. I feel like this book introduces the story line and then just stops. It is like reading half of a book and then waiting six months to finish it. I am sure I will get the book, but I will resist the next set of books that are sure to come. I would rather pay double for the complete book than be suckered in for part II."
4,An excellent book,"Zahn has to be the best writer in the Star Wars business (next to Lucas). Reading his material you get a sense that he truly understands the characters and what motivates them. I just wish he had had more control over the series between his first set and the two new books. If you always felt Luke and Mara belonged together, then this series is for you."
3,"Good book, but a little dense in clarity.","I had a lot of mixed feelings about this book. Sometimes when I was reading it, I would be on the edge of my seat, intent on turning the pages as fast as I could. However, sometimes, I felt like reading another word would make my eyeballs fall out so my friends could use them for golf balls. Overall, I'd say you should read it, but not if you want action every minute."
5,Great Information,This is an invaluable resource for giving parents information and advice on various childhood medical questions. I highly recommend it!
4,Amazing toy!,This is such a wonderful toy! The only drawback that caused the 4 star rating instead of 5 was that the batteries included were practically dead.
5,"very sturdy, interactive toy!!","Purchased this toy for my daughter when she was 8 months old. She is now a year old and loves it. She loves putting the car in drive, then reverse. There is so many realistic sounds and buttons to keep her entertained. Also the toy is VERY durable to little curious ones. She has tried numerous times to rip off the moving windshield wipers, and they still work like new without coming off. Couldn't ask for a better toy."
5,Great toy,"I got this for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter and she absolutely loves it! There are similar products available, but this one is the best, in my opinion. Lots of sounds, colors and moving parts. Seems durable enough, too."
4,Instant Emotional Healing ~ Acupressure for the Emotions,"This is an amazing book. I'm suffering from the side effects of Levaquin. During my last CT scan they discovered I had Follicular Lymphoma cancer. Afterwards, I was diagnosed with Peripheral Neuropathy on my legs and feet. Reading the book helps me be positive with everyhting."
4,Cute,"Nice plush, soft. Bought for 9 month old. Makes a nice first stuffer animal. Squeaker is difficult for very small children."
5,Hopi by Jake Page,"Outstanding book! GREAT pictures that probably could not be duplicated today, as the Hopi gave remarkable access to the Pages for this book. The Pages have not abused that trust."
5,Beautifully done book.,This is a beautiful second updated printing of the original done in 1982. The book is special because every aspect of it was checked and approved by the Hopi's themselves. After making several trips to Hopi over the last year I find this publication to be a very accurate depiction of the Hopi people.
5,BUYSLIPPERY WHEN WET REMASTERED TODAY!,"This is Slippery When Wet remastered, sounding better than ever, and with the flipside of the disc including a few videos of the band live.This is an excellent CD and I reccommend that you buy this today."
1,It doesn't work,"After two trips to the mechanics, we finally figured out that this new cap doesn't work. It gets loose after a while, no matter how tight I fasten it after pumping gas. Then the check engine light would go on and we had a hard time figuring out what went wrong. I switched to use a geniue part from the dealer and it worked, much better."
5,"10"" X 13"" White Plastic Sink","This produce was actually what I needed for my project.If you need a small sink,This is it. easy to install, ifyour a handyman."
1,"if youre looking for halflife, look elsewhere","I bought this game looking for a Half-Life. Many reviews praised this game as being absolutely amazing and revolutionary. This game was everything but. The only reason this game was amazing is because of Geo-mod, the new engine that allows you to bust through walls, but besides that, the game falls short. The plot is extremely dry, and seems to end as quickly as it had begun. Yeah blowing holes through walls is cool, but not cool enough to spend 50 bucks on it. I give this game a 1."
2,poor sound,"Poor sound, the rest is ok. I have better versions! Solti is good, Furtwangler is even better!Martin"
4,can get lost,hi i was very happy with this drive however when i travelleld recently it some how fell out of the key chain
1,Decent drive but horrible design,Works well BUT the top is not so easy to use. It is a struggle each time to pop it open. The band is too tight and it takes both hands and strong fingers to unlock it. There are lots of other drives that works as well without the problem.
5,Lexar Jump Drive,This drive was extremely easy to use and is very handy since you can attach it to your keychain. I haven't had any problems with it on several different computers and it is very fast data transmission.
3,another disappointing Anne sequel,"My family loves the Anne of Green Gables books and movies, so we rented this from Netflix. This is the 4th film in the Anne of Green Gables saga. The story is a flashback to Anne's life before she arrives at Green Gables. The acting was ok. My major gripe is that the film totally re-writes Anne's back-story, turning her character into a liar."
1,Same Book?,"Wow, after reading the other reviews I'm not sure we're talking about the same book. First of all, I'd call this book more of a pamphlet. It's 117 pages in length that actually starts on page 15 with the introduction. There were 8 blank pages between chapters and the print was quite large. A book of 95 net pages that I, being a slow reader, easily read in less than 45 minutes is hardly what I would call a ""book"". I purchased through Toastmasters International (sorry Amazon!) for an award presentation and I'm just too embarrassed to hand it to the recipient. The content was just OK. I am convinced that there are many better reads on the subject."
5,They are wonderful,I have seen these guys live a few times in SF. They are really great! I love their cd's (both of them)
4,Excellent for an unexpected use,"I had read on a website that for dealing with tight foot arches, a lacrosse ball was a great low-cost solution*. I picked one up and followed instructions - a few minutes a day rolling the ball under each foot. At first it was excruciating, but over time I noticed more give, less pain and sensitivity in the feet and calves, and greater range of motion. My toes, almost permanently curled in on themselves, have lengthened and straightened out, and walking is less painful.You could do the same with something similar, I imagine, but the size and density of the lacrosse ball has been well worth the purchase price.* [...]"
2,"Trouble with CDs, poor reception","I have had this radio since 2009. Though I like the look, I am extremely unhappy with performance. The radio reception is poor and very few CDs work, this could be attributed to changes in CD manufacturing. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Should have returned it, now I want to smash it:)"
4,Good reference for advanced beginners,"This is a technical book, detailing all the complex rules of writing Thai. For beginners who have not studied linguistics, the methodology used may be inaccessible. For those who already know some Thai, and would like to improve their ability to spell, and to determine tones of unknown words while reading, this is a very good resource. The book contains no exercises -- book refers to a Thai Reader which contains exercises -- I have not seen the Thai Reader."
1,This book was too technical and Thai print hard to read,I was looking for a book that would teach me how to write the Thai alphabet. Ms. Haas' book would be fine for a Thai language instructor or an upper division or graduate student. I was totally lost after page 2.
5,class act,"well-written,well-balanced, and entertaining documentary of Chabad. I will recommend it to all. One cannot help but admire the good that this religious community accomplishes. One person can do much good in this world."
5,breathe-taking ACTNG AND EVER REMEMBERABLE CHARACTERS,"This was a the film which made me a true fan of KAZAN'S WORK.HE IS A POET.(I APOLGIZED ABOUT THE SCREAMING MY COMPUTER IS STUCK ON CAPS.)HE IS THE BEST, BECAUSE THROUGH HIS FILM AMERICA,AMERICA HE WAS ABLE TO CONVEY THE TRUE DETERMINATION OF THE MAIN CHARACTER."
4,Goin Crazy in Staircase once again offers entertaining cast.,"In this fourth volume of the Mac Fontana series, Earl Emerson offers up an entertaining cast of offbeat characters and fast paced storyline. This time around the story revolves around a copy-cat arsonist who is setting fires in Staircase. Nearby Seattle also has an arsonist on their hands. Mac has to solve this mystery whilst protecting his own son, battling small time politics, romancing a celebrity in hiding, catching dog killers, keeping an eye on power hungry safety directors and putting out fires in and around town, including false alarms at the local nudist colony.This Mac Fontana is good, but not as good as Morons and Madmen, or even Black Hearts and Slow Dancing. However, it is still a lot of fun and Emerson has once again written another winner."
4,Better than average and better than book one,The action definetly picked up in this book. There were a lot less typos in this book also which made it better to read. I would recommend this book to any Star Wars fan.
1,"Boring, but ot the worst","There's not much to say here this book was boring but nothing beats out ""children of the jedi"". the ending is good however. I was really diappointed after reading he first one."
4,Better then most,"In an audio application, the difference between one wire and another is critical if noticeable. I tried this because it was from the best of the few manufacturers making a ""better"" firewire cable. The sound is better then most but I have some independent ones that carry the bass better. In general it is about as good as most Monster cables are, meaning better then some, but a long way from being the best."
2,I'll never read mcDevitt again,"While mcDevitt's basic idea is interesting -- the discovery of an automated alien exploration vessel that has been traveling for millenia -- the writing is terrible. There is almost no character development and nothing to like about them. They're whiny and one dimensional. And for supposedly highly successful people, they're dumb as bricks. Even if you're not a trained ""explorer"" you don't simply barge into dangerous situations without taking some precausions. And they do this repeatedly, despite their past mistakes, blundering into bad situations over and over and over and over again. Even though Hutch seems to be more intelligent and is aware of the potential the dangers involved, she repeatly lets herself be pushed around by her not-so-bright passengers."
3,A lot like DEEPSIX,"OK Read... found it to be too much like the previous Hutch-based novel DEEPSIX, though - with too many ""saved at the last second cliffhangers"" (most of them somehow involving ropes and nets), making things just too unbelievable... like all this could really happen to one chick (Hutch), in just a few years time."
3,Rama Revisited...,"This is my third try with Jack McDevitt and absolutely my last. Unengaging characters who spout drivel too long about nothing of real interest, and the least original premis and plotline of any book I've read recently.More soap opera than space opera I'm afraid, and way too slow and derivative."
3,A boy and his truck,"My son received this for Christmas for his first birthday, three years ago. He still enjoys playing with it..and it is still in perfect condition. It has taken a lot of wear and tear and shows no signs of aging."
3,Baby Hulk?,I bought this for my 14 month old son. Within 24 hours he tore it apart!!! I still can't get one of the back wheels to screw back on. Crazy glue might help.
3,Not sturdy and well-designed like other Little Tikes toys,"This truck is not at all like the Little Tikes Car Carrier truck that we have. Children can sit on it and ride it with no problem (the 2 sports cars are equally as sturdy). You have to watch the back of this truck because it is constantly tipping back, causing the child to fall down. It's not designed to be played with the way children of this age like to play.A friend of mine had to call Little Tikes for a replacement for her truck because the rear wheel kept falling off. Then the whole metal axle would slide out - not a very safe thing with little ones around.It seems that the newer Little Tikes stuff that is being outsourced to Chinese manufacturers is really junky compared to the stuff that was produced in US factories. Guess they're trying to reduce costs, but the product is suffering.I would not recommend this product at all."
4,Excellent,"After the first track I was hooked. A friend of mine loaned the CD to me and I had to have one. check out the feeling in the demos. You'll want one too! Thank You, Shirley Cason! (you only get 4 stars because I'm leaving headroom for your next CD!"
5,Been buying for years,"I buy this at my local health food store & my very fussy 12 year old, likes these! He doesn't drink as much milk as when he was younger, so I supplement his diet with these to hopefully keep his bones strong & the Animal Parade chewable multi-vitamin. They both have whole food concentrates, which is good."
2,"I love The Office, but this wasn't as wonderful as I had hoped","I am a big fan of the office and all of their PSA shorts on YouTube, but this just isn't as much fun. No special clips. This was just a rehash of some Dwight moments. The music wasn't really laugh out loud funny. After it was finished, I thought I downloaded Amazon's Unbox and downloaded this?? Thank goodness I didn't pay $2 for it."
3,The office - overtime,"it was ok, would have been better if Dwight and Michael were in it. It just wasn't the same without them."
4,1993 WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING,"A made for T.V film about the bombing of the World Trade Center, done in a kind of 'Pulp Fiction' style with a kind of narration from the FBI man in charge of the investigation (Peter Gallagher)explaining to his superiors about the information they had on suspects movements before and after the attack. Slow at times with some decent acting and shots of the Center itself. The final scene and comment in the film, so ironic as to what would unfortunately take place 8 years later."
3,Here we go again,"I was disappointed in 12 Sharp. They story line was okay, I guess. I'm starting to think Ranger's a real whimp. What happened to things like, ""I'm an opportunist."" And ""I'm not a nice guy. I take what I want""? Ranger is a great character. I love this character. I just don't think he'd be so passive if he actually spent so much time in bed with Steph. It just isn't believable for me any more.Oh, and if you're trying to figure out how Steph quit working for Rangeman, forget it. Apparently you're supposed to use your imagination.I guess it's a good story, but I wish the story line would have Steph move forward or move back instead of going around and around the same circle in her relationships. This passive-aggressiveness with Ranger is making me crazy."
3,Twelve Not-So-Sharp,"I'm sorry to say that I think Evanovich has reached the end of the road with the Plum novels. The repetition has started to become annoying. No matter what the plot line, you can count on Plum's cars being destroyed, her ambivalent feelings for the men in her life to be raised, Grandma's eccentricities to be manifest, etc., etc., etc. We KNOW it isn't going to be Shakespeare going in, but let's see SOME character development with age, please. The books were fun in the beginning, not so much any more. It's just same old, same old."
5,Stephanie's best yet!,"I dove into Twelve Sharp yesterday, read about 250 pages that day and finished it early this morning - so you can tell I love this book - This is a laugh out loud book. The plot mostly centers around Ranger and a Ranger wannabee who has kidnapped his daughter - he turns to Stephanie Plum to help him find the guy and Ranger's kid. The chemistry is hot between Stephanie and Joe, and Stephanie and Ranger - Both guys to swoon for - Stephanie's parents are a perfect foil for her and her Grandma Mazur - I think Grandma Mazur is a hoot - she gets in more trouble and tells it like it is - hilarious!!! Lula is more outrageous, Sally Sweet has her in his rock band, with bizarre concerts -I could go on and on - But Ms. Evanovich keep going strong where some serial writers are starting to fade a little -A delightful read!"
5,Twelve Sharp,Love Stephanie Plum novels if you want a good book and to laugh these are the books to buy and enjoy
4,12 Sharp needs sharpening.,"THe story was good, but not as good as her other Plum books. It wasn't as funny this times as in others books.Keep writing the Plum books, they still are a good read!"
4,"Twelve Sharp (Stephanie Plum, No. 12)","A good book, in a good series. Stephanie Plum is always entertaining and humorous."
5,Keep Them Coming!,"Evanovich keeps us all on the edge of our seats for the next Plum adventure(s)! Just hang on for the laughs and enjoy the wild ride with Stephanie, Grandma Mazur and Lula!"
4,"Good, but . . .","This one was good, but not as good as some of the others in the series. I kept waiting for her car to blow up, and was sad it never happened. Was that a spoiler?"
2,Twelve Sharp,"The book just wasn't up to the usual fun and laughs. It read fast but there really wasn't much going on. No car explosions, no big laughs with grandma or Lula, no really funny take down captures. The story did give a lot more background info on Ranger and his life which was nice. Stephanie usually has dumb luck on her side, this story had her trying to think and analyze her way around. The dumb luck finds and experiences worked much better. The book was alright but not anywhere near as good as the rest. I was disappointed after the long wait."
4,12 sharp,"Funny, thrilling, captivating.. as always, Janet Evanovich has created a perfect read. You can never be bored when reading a ""Plum"" novel."
5,Forced Induction Performance Tuning A Practical Guide to Sup,"This an excellent reference book for anyone who wants to learn about modern concepts of an automotive forced induction. You will find the information you've been looking for about modern forced induction cars either domestic, import or european.Definately recommend this book."
1,Installation and Performance and Support,"I'm not at all impressed with the product, ease of installation, performance or tech support. Granted, I have Win98 but I still can't recommend the product. It took two hrs to install it using a chat link with tech support. Instructions on web address given on product are worthless. English was so poor on tech support instructions I had to study them closely to figure out what they meant. Now that it is installed, when I try to open it about every other time I get the message no such drive exists. Today I was told it needed to be formatted. When this happens I have to reboot. If I tried to reformat it said I'd lose all data. It is a nuisance and when i do get new computer I'll get new flash drive, too. Don't recommend it!!!!!"
3,"Good book, baaaaad editing","I just had to write a review of this book, because I think it is the most poorly edited published text that I have ever read. Not only is it chock-full of typos, but the author repeats himself unnecessarily in a number of places. The sorry state of this text is even more surprising given that it is a third edition. One would expect better from Blackwell's. That said, the book does serve as a good general intro to the topic. The author is interesting and clear, and seems to hit the important points."
4,"Hips, Thighs and Abs...good but short","The Firms ""Hips, Thighs and Abs"" is a 35 mins workout which is performed on the floor/firm signature box. Its a good, toning workout, but very short. The Abs section is way too short, I ended up doing another Abs tape to compensate. Honestly, you really don't need the firm box for most of the exercises, I found the floor just as good, if not more comfortable. I like the use of the Firm Sculpting Stick, which adds that little bit extra resistance, but I have also used 10 lbs weights as well. Pam Cauthen is one of my favourite instructors and she leads the exercise very well with lots of encouragement. I highly recommend this DVD when you are short on time, but want an effective leg toning/ab firming workout."
3,McFadden is still a favorite,"I have read all three of Mcfadden's prior novels. This is a very talented sister with three dimentional well told stories that I usually finish over the course of a weekend. Needless to say I was looking forward to ""Donovan"". Much to my surprise I found the novel mildly interesting with a rushed ending. I really wanted to feel for campbell at the end of her break down. Especially when the story begins by letting you know that this is about a love gone wrong and even in the present donovan is still thought of. I felt a little let down. Alot of time was spent on the character's upbringings. But their time spent together seems too much like two ships passing in the night. It wasnt the love supreme it lead up to be. Mcfadden has a real talent for creating strong female characters who's past are heart felt. I highly recommend her debut ""Sugar"""
2,What in the World ???,"This book came recommended to me and I was looking forward to reading it. I read the first section on ""Campbell"" and to this day, I don't know who or what? The author lost me completely and totally on this chapter. I couldn't tell the voices apart. I didn't know who had the abortion. I could've gone back and read it all from the beginning again, but the author wrote this book tackily and I was just too lost to go and retreive anything.When I read Donovan's section, it was comprehensible. I actually enjoyed reading his section, but the section that combined Campbell and Donovan was so boring. I just could not finish reading this book. This read was an awful recommendation. I actually was also looking forward to reading ""Sugar,"" but now since I've read this one, and am highly disappointed, I'm not to sure if I will read it."
3,Another quick-read,"hmmmmmm... I read the other reviews and am sorry to say that I didn't think very highly of this book. I read it but wasn't very impressed with this book. I expected more. I expected it to keep me interested until the end. I got bored with Campbell's and Donovans section of the book. I will continue to be a fan of Bernice L. McFadden. Her previous books, Sugar and This Bitter Earth are outstanding."
1,Didn't last a month,"Replaced our old heat tape with this brand about a month ago, when the old heat tape finally gave out after years of use, and the pipes froze. This brand kept the pipes moving once we had thawed everything out and replaced the tape and insulation... until tonight. This claims to be good down to -50F, but apparently -8F is too much for it. The pipes froze again, and now we're having to take turns sitting out in the coldest weather of the season (we live on the Eastern Plains of Colorado), in the middle of the night, trying to thaw out the pipes. For the price and the amount of time it actually worked, this was a really poor investment."
5,so cute and quality-made,"Got these for my daughter to use on her ""traffic rug"" (the rug for kids with streets, houses, etc, on it) with matchbox cars. She loves them and enjoys recognizing these signs in real life and vice versa. They seem high quality and have no problem remaining upright on the rug. Glad we bought them."
3,Ok for small bikes,It was easy to install and set up. However theholder for the top bike does not hold well since the metal part it hooks on its not round so it falls down. So the top hook not really made for large bike on top. I wish it held so I could use it cause great design but had to return cause wouldnt hold a mens bike on top
1,Poorly Designed,"Don't buy this hangar for anything other than sheets and towels. The product is very poorly designed, and poorly constructed. First of all, you cannot crank the the top and bottom screws tight enough to secure the rack, between the floor and ceiling, without bending the pole. In addition the pole comes in two sections with two differenct diameters - a small diameter chrome plated section that telescopes inside of a larger diameter painted piece, but the attachment cleats on the hangars can only be tightened over the larger diameter section, making the top section unusable. The weight of my bike was enough to rip the hangar off the chrome section, causing it to fall to the floor, even though I cranked the knob as tight as possible."
1,Wobbly,"I was so excited to find this rack on amazon. I had seen ones similar but made from wood that were going for 5 times the price (they were handmade). The package came quickly and was easy to assemble. But the the rack just doesn't seem stable , I currently have two bikes on it and the top bike continues to slide down. Both bikes are very light road bikes, so I am not sure what would be the ideal bike for this flimsy rack?"
4,We like it... not perfect,"We've had it for about a year and things are going well so far. The only problem is that one of the knobs for the bike hangers are difficult to tighten enough. This means that if the bikes aren't hung perfectly balanced, they can tip forwards or backwards a bit. But there is no threat of the bike actually falling off the hanger. We don't regret buying it for a second."
2,Just my opinion,"This is a book that I purchased about 8 years ago, shortly after the birth of my first child. We love the bright and childlike graphics, and the general story line, it is easy to read and easy to understand. However, before my children learned to read and I was still reading to them I would always omit the line on page 3 that goes as follows...""And, sometimes he caught a hard smack across his backside when he was late for dinner!."" I find this line terribly offensive and completly out of context to the rest of the story...We have actually blacked it out, now that the children are reading their own books. I would be very curious to know, how in this day and age of anti-child abuse literature and people being better informed of the alternative forms of discipline available to parents, how did this book ever get published with such a blatant display of child abuse. I find it harsh and offensive."
4,So Cool!,"I've discovered teen trends dolls only recently, why did I take soooo long!? I don't have any teen trends dolls, but I would have Kianna and her 2 other fashions(sold separatley) if I was smart enogh to choose them! I reeeeeealy hate myself for that! Anyway back to what matters. I gave it 5 stars for fun Bcuz one of my friends has one and I really enjoy playing with them. 3 stars for educational because the only thing it teaches you is how to be super stylin! 3 stars for durability because the hair is stiff and the limbs aren't too well made. Overall 4 stars. Wish i could say 5, but the two 3s threw it off.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Easy class and easy read,"Buying the book from Amazon was cheaper and faster instead of buying the book from my campus's bookstore.(I saved $40, and the book shipped to my house in one day.) However, the quality of the text made the entire summer course unbearably boring. The information given in the text can be shortened into outlines without the unnecessary examples and images that add 'fluff' to the basic material.The only positive out of ordering this book was the ability to Trade-In the book for a savings of about $16 and three hours of credit to boost my GPA."
5,More Than 7 Habits,"This is the original from which Covey based all his later 7 Habits books, writings, seminars, etc. Much more powerful than expected, this is not a book for the squeamish. If you're afraid to improve, if you're afraid to make your life enormously successful, then stay away from this book. If you want to know what First Things First means, here's a great place to start."
3,Very low range,This item is very easy to install even with the limited instructions provided. However once i installed this item i noticed that i could get it to turn my lights on from a distance of over 50 feet but only get them to turn off when i had the remote right next to the antenna! This is very annoying. I emailed the manufacturer and hope to hear back.
5,"Worked great, simple solution.",The 12v remote control worked perfectly for a remote salt spreader switch. I wired the unit's output to a higher current relay to protect the box in case of over current. Wired the system into the truck's 7 way trailer plug for power. Now I can switch on the salt spreader and it's lights without running a cable into the cab with it's switch.
1,Simple to use and hookup product,"No directions but it is very easy to connect and use. This devices is rated for up to 15 amps. I was going to connect a 16.5 am devices so I also bought a relay to use with this product. After connected I tried before hooking up the end device. I had connected to a volt meter to test the output. It worked twice with no load, then that was it. It did not work the third time. I thought maybe the remote so I used the other remote switch, it worked once and then that was it. Going to try to return."
1,Failed after a month,I purchased this unit to trigger an Aoogah horn I mounted under the hood of my HHR. This unit failed after barely a month of use and not a lot of use. All tests point to the relay failing. I am looking at other manufactures for a better quality replacement.
2,Feel like I missed something,"While the shots in this movie where quite beautiful and peaceful, I've gotta say the movie was on the whole rather dull and uninspiring. There is quite a juxtaposition between the totally uninteresting quest of the main character and all his bumbling, and the beautiful simplicity of the life continuing on around him (best expressed in his motorcycle ride with the doctor), however either I missed some subtlety of this juxtaposition or I just found it a bit boring and entirely undeserving of 2 hours of cinematic treatment."
3,Slow and methodical but beautiful view of another world,"Slow and methodical but beautiful view of another world. There is not much happening but the joy of watching people in a world so unlike mine was wonderful. The simple acts of smoking and shaving seem to become inspiration of a movie that looks at what is good and what is evil, not in George W's view but from ordinary country people in Iran. I was glad to view this distant world but it may be too slow for many, you have to be in the proper frame of mind to enjoy this one."
2,I'm not satisfied and It Doesn't Register...,"It's too much a puzzle. Not much of poetry, in fact rather prosaic. Sorry I am not very satisfied and it doesn't really register save and except that it's quite a puzzle and, it's long. Perhaps it has the wrong cast, the hero did not impress at all, nor was the countryside nor village scenes... I tried to but haven't finished the second viewing, it's quite an effort. I have high esteem for Iranian films, and I enjoy ""The White Balloon"" so much and also another film about broken shoes where children don't have shoes for school... They are so wonderful, but I'm afraid, no, not this one."
2,Snoozer,"This film is about the appreciation of life at its simplest. The cinematography is beautiful; great job capturing a civilization uncluttered and spiritual. However, the protagonist, whom we follow exclusively throughout the film, is a bore, and the plot is simple and mundane. The symbolic juxtapostion of the cell phone against the spiritual and uncluttered civilization doesn't strike the chord Kiarostami intends. There is little story here. In summary: very good cinematography, beautiful setting, extrememely boring protagonist, contrived symbolism, little story. Your choice. I personally liked the Iranian films ""Children of Heaven"" and ""The Color of Paradise"" much more. This one will just put you to sleep."
4,shades of blue (plural),"These dishes are really pretty. But no, it's not your browser or your eyes playing tricks, the little plates really are a completely different shade of blue than the dinner size. We thought it was a defect at first but apparently that's just how they are, and the cups definitely don't match, but they are made of a completely different material too. Oh well, guess it only matters if you use all the pieces at the same time, and we usually don't.Ease of ordering, delivery time and price were bang on. Yay Amazon!"
2,Not a good Yoga Video,"I am in the minority, but I did not care for this yoga workout. I found the cueing confusing and uneven. The instructor does not state what yoga pose we are doing either which would be helpful. She never says- this is the triangle pose or warrior I. There is inadequate time spent in the stretches and the transitioning is rocky.I enjoy many other Firm workouts but this one was a dud. I would recommend Rodney Yee Yoga DVD's or David Swenson and/or Baron Baptiste. You would get a more valuable Yoga Stretch workout and Yoga knowledge from these instructors rather than the Firm's take on Yoga."
3,Misrepresented,"I was under the impression (as described on the box)that this would be an off-day workout. Wrong. This is a semi-tough routine but there is nothing hatha about it. In all fairness, I only did about 20 minutes of it, so I didn't complete it but it was just too bloody difficult.The workout utilized squats and other traditional exercise moves. The 'yoga' consisted of athletic stretches.All in all not a bad workout, but I was just expecting something lighter and more congruent with traditional yoga."
2,Not good for small dogs,"I bought this size because I read some reviews about the handle being too small and thought it might be helfpul for my husband to have a larger handle. Unlike the cord leash, the belt leash has a strong continual pull on the dog. This was too much for my dog and I ended up needing to return it."
5,A great read!,"This book is so, so good - both in terms of the storyline and the writing style. The novel is about the relationships between triplet sisters and, to a lesser degree, their mother; however, each twin has her own fully developed individual story as well. The author portrays sisterly love and rivalry with uncanny ease. The writing was extremely well done and this book was a joy to read! Loved it!"
4,Fun Read,"A simple, yet fun read about three sisters who are triplets. The book goes into the lives of each sister, their career choices and relationships. The book explores in a light-hearted manner just how much their life decisions where impacted by the relationship with their siblings. For example, one sister thought their ""opinions"" were one and the same and she couldn't disagree with one of her sisters. She didn't have ""her"" opinion it was always ""their"" opinion.To add to the crazy thinking was the fact that they were the product of two teenagers who by the time their mother realized she was pregnant was already broken up with the father. However, this happened at a time when good Catholic girls who got pregnant married the father of her child or in this case children!Three Wishes had me laughing and crying as I read about life as a triplet."
5,Such a Good Read,"Three Wishes is a wonderfully funny, touching story . The book centers around the adult lives of triplet sisters it's ,funny, touching and very entertaining . A definite page turner.."
2,not nearly as useful as The Missing Manual,"I bought this book first, and then later bought a copy of a competitor book: David Pogue and company's ""IPhoto, The Missing Manual"". There's no comparison. This book will teach you the mechanics of how to use iPhoto, but not much more than that. The Missing Manual goes much deeper, telling you how iPhoto works and techniques for using it effectively. My quickstart guide is now collecting dust while I refer to the missing manual frequently."
5,A unique book for color,"I was looking for a long time to find a good book for color. And I found it in this one.It is comprehensive, authoritative and amazingly illustrated in full color. You will learn about the therapeutic uses of color in all areas of your life: Food, clothes, make-up, home and garden. You will discover your personal colors, colors that help your diet or your health, and your soul colors too.This book will make your life colorful! Enjoy it.By Thei Zervaki..."
4,Great collection of short plays using Bible stories!,This is a great collection of short plays by Beth Sharpton! We use the Bible based scenarios in our weekly church services.
2,Not very good,"Remote control only works if you point it at a small hole on the lower left side of screen. (I also replaced the battery with a fresh one.) Per customer support, the best thing to do to make it work is to REMOVE the frame around the screen first, use the remote, then put the frame back! I don't think so. Bottom line: Would I buy this product again? Nope. I am returning it ASAP."
5,First rate chillout album,"Art of chill was originally released in 2002 or 2003, and has been re-released. This 2 CD set continues to be one of my top rated chillout albums. This chillout is not commercialized like the domestic Ultra Chill compilations but rather it is trance based chill with a touch of new-age. The mixing is more continuously played than mixed, where nature sounds (birds, the ocean) are used to link the tracks together. While this method does not transform tracks, it is very effective in creating a peaceful mood with seamless transitions. This CD includes tracks from Art of Trance, and Paul Oakenfold's Southern Sun (chilled version), which do not demand your attention but are interesting enough to listen to in a car and not fall asleep.Highly recommended but also check out the more upbeat ""Best of Euphoric Chillout"" CD's by Breakdown, and Red Jerry's ambient like ""Deep & chilled Euphoria""."
3,okay,This book was some what helpful and some information on cats but I am looking for something with more detail of my area and location on where I fish at.
2,WHY?,"As a parent of a child who has been very fond of this seriesI have to say that she was very disappointed with the new""big head"" design of this video. She won't watch it and shedoesn't care for the toys of the same design.As someone who has watched several episodes myself, along with mylittle girl, I have to agree that the new dvd/toy design seems skewed,and I'm not sure why they bothered, really.The new design is so unappealing that it actually made ME long for theformer standard! Aside from the new look, I found this new dvd to belacking. The music is ok but the stories (as far as these stories go)seemed sub-par. It doesn't match up to Minty Christmas, Runaway Rainbow,A very Pony Place, etc. It will be interesting to see what they tryto foist on us next go round."
3,not quite 1000 piece puzzel.....some pieces missing!,This puzzel was a real challange particularly because 4 pieces were missing. We were disappointed. It arrived in a timely manor and was a sealed box but not a complete puzzel.
5,Jigsaw Insects,Really enjoyed this puzzle. The pieces are nice and durable.I only wish that the names of the insects had been included.
1,"Good book, crappy supplier","I've read some of the Tao Te Ching here and there online, it's not hard to find. But I wanted to have my own physical copy of this great piece of work. The reviews are great for the book and it's inexpensive, and I'm sure it's a great translation.The reason I give it 1 star is not because of the book but solely on customer service of the supplier, ""pbshofus"" or whatever it's name is. I ordered the book on August 13th and it is now August 28th and still have not received the book. It shouldn't take that long to mail a $3 book, nobody is that busy to not be able to do that. It'll be the last time I order from this. I could've gone to Barnes & Nobles or something instead for the book, not waste money."
1,Goal II,The dvd skipped in the middle and the tracking is bad. Almost like it was defective from the get go.
3,Not all that I wanted,I want a dictionary that gives the pronounciation of English place names. This does not do that. Cites earliest mention of the location in historical documents.
4,Just what I expected!,"I ordered 2 of these sets. I only gave it 4 stars due to the muted colors, but after reading the reviews I was expecting that. They are still beautiful, and I love them. I will have to order the 28 oz. bowls as the ones that came with it are hardly what my family would consider a soup or cereal bowl. I will be ordering the salad plates as well. The cups are a nice size, not too big or small.I recieved both sets in the same box and was scared they would be damaged. As I saw how they were packaged as I took them out of the box, I was amazed not one thing was broken, which is a testament to the durability of these dishes. I would recommend them."
1,This product is pathetic...don't buy.,"We bought 3 sets from WalMart and all have warped dishes. The phone rep said they're made thinner now, and don't judge by stacking, but look at them ""one at a time"", and that they should sit fine on the table. In other words, 'yes, we have an inferior product and we know it's inferior. But hey, just don't look at it very closely and ignore the flaws. They still hold food, so don't complain'. Well, I'm sorry Corelle, but this product looks like a joke, and your sorry attempt at explaining it away would be comical if it weren't so frustrating. And stoneware cups? Are you kidding? If I wanted stoneware, I would have shopped for and purchased stoneware. This is pathetic, and Corelle should be ashamed to put this product on the shelf. Back to WalMart they go, and we're through thinking that Corelle is a quality product. I'd rather eat on paper than use these clown plates. I gave it one star because it wouldn't let me leave it as zero."
3,Not The Corelle I remember,"OK, so Corelle is known for it being fade, break, scratch, and chip-resistant. Well I've have been using this set about 14 months now, with just normal wear, and SEVERAL of my plates are chipped. I'll admit that I use the dinner plates about 5 nights out of the week, but the small plates I only use once in awhile, and they are chipped as well. Not sure where these were made-I'm guessing China or Taiwan."
4,"Mugs are stoneware, not Vitrelle","I have owned Corelle dinnerware for over 20 years. It has served our family well, but a few of the pieces chipped or were broken over the years. Since we needed a larger set for our growing family, I purchased three of these sets to replace my old pieces. I was tired of my old floral pattern and wanted something festive for our kids so I decided to try this pattern. The previous reviewers were right in that the colors are much more muted than they appear in the photos, but I still think it's a nice choice. I was also a bit surprised that the mugs are stoneware, but after getting over the surprise, I'm actually very delighted with them. They have a nice weight and feel to them, and I like them much more than my old Vitrelle cups. I would have been thrilled if they came in red. We'll see how long they last with my kids. I only wish that the luncheon sized plates were included. I ended up ordering them separately and now have all the pieces I need."
3,Everyday Dishes,"Everyday dishes don't have to be perfect or pretty or fancy, just plain-old useful. Therefore, these do exactly what they're supposed to do-hold food. Based on the badly misshapen dinner plate included, they generously threw in an extra which was closer to normal shape. The price was indicative of the product received and it was far less of a bargain than it seemed, but I needed everyday dishes, so it ends there and whenever company comes to call, the Corelle will be well-hidden to avoid snickering and snide comments."
2,Attention Candidates,This review book had too many detailed questioned and caused undue stress with its practice tests. The questions did not match what was on the actual exam I took. I repeatedly scored 60-65% on practice sections and tests and finally stopped using this book and changed books. The CD accompanyings this book only has 400+ questions on it and it does not supply rationale for the questions on the CD. It is not conducive to actual computer test taking. There are several errors in the questions and a few questions in the book have different answers than the CD. I passed my exam but not with the help of this book. I would recommend the Fitzgerald review CDs and Zerwekh and Claborn's Adult Nurse Practitioner Certification Review. I scored 75% on their practice tests consistently and those questions matched those on the actual test.
1,Terrible Book,"This book is truly terrible and an insult the nursing profession. I plead with the authors to remove the book off the shelves or IMPROVE IT NOW! The answers are wrong and outdated , one answer told me to put a woman on HRT for hypertenstion and hyperlidpidemia, this information is atleast 5 years old. And in the tests in the back of the book, they don't give rationale for the answers... they just refer you back to the chapter... WHO HAS TIME TO REREAD THE CHAPTER. The questions are also very poor and very specific. IT will make you doubt yourself, even though you know what your talking about."
2,Old and brief,"This book is a reprint of the 1973 Baker's Dictionary of Christian Ethics (over 30 years old!). As such it lacks the seriousness and academic excellence that much of modern, evangelical dictionaries have. It squeezes 700 topics into 700 pages, which means that the articles are too short for being on ethical issues, which usually are controversial with many opinions and arguments. Hence the discussion is absent and they are more of brief descriptions of what the author thinks. It would have been better with 100 topics on 700 pages. Look for another book!"
5,I could not believe what I was seeing...Very informative wow!!!,"This is my hometown, I went to school and college there.I started raising my children there I can hardly believe what has happened in the thirty years since I left. That was a dirty fight ....for shame. I Love Cory Booker's committment to Newark. He is awesome. We cannot expect others to do for us, what we won't even do for ourselves.It takes the whole city to make the needed changes. We need to teach our children by our actions, not by our words. If you want change let it begain with you!Why is it the we no longer hold people accountable for the wrong they do, even when it affects our homes and our children's future? This movie gave me an inside look how important it is to educate yourself during an election."
5,Best tea for the ol' Brown Betty,While living for a month in Scotland in a self catering we had settled into this tea from the Co-Op as our favorite. When we returned to the states we put away our coffee machine and went with pots of tea for breakfast. Great stuff! The longer you steep it the fuller the flavor ... max about 8 minutes. Brought home 4 boxes in our suitcases. The tea was so good we donated clothes to the local charity to make room for it. When we got back to the states and ran out we replinished our supply with Amazon ... thanks for being so global Amazon! :-) Cheers!
3,No Better; No Worse,"I bought this upon the recommendation of my hairdresser because I wanted a product with more holding power than what I was using for my locks. And I thought ""Hey, it's from Jamaica the home of dreadlocks, it must be good!""But, I can't say that I have noticed much difference between this product and any of the others I have purchased in the past in terms of keeping my locks neat. However, on the upside, it does not make my hair feel as dry as some other gels I've used.Would I buy it again? Nah, I'll just go to the pharmacy and buy other products off the shelf in my quest for the neatest locks around."
2,Cute series and storyline idea - poor writing,"I enjoy cozy mysteries and the idea of friends from a knitting club getting together to solve the murder of a friend sounded interesting. However, the awkward dialog sounded like a novel written for pre-teens. I couldn't get past the writing style and didn't enjoy this book."
4,great cozy mystery for the avid knitter,"If I'm not knitting wool, I'm spinning it or weaving it. When I take the time to read, if I don't read a non-fiction about something in the fiber arts, I read a mystery novel.This is another good Maggie Sefton mystery and it kept me reading it every free moment I could spare. I won't spoil anything for you, but I'll say this: buy this book and read it and give it on to a knitter friend."
2,Deadly Dull,"I have to admit, if this series weren't about knitting, I probably wouldn't keep reading it. This book seemed to be the most poorly edited of the three so far -- several typos in the text, and errors in plot that should have been caught but weren't.Kelly and her friends just aren't real people to me -- more ""Betty and Veronica,"" where they are two-dimensional, with no real depth or interest.The plot was slightly interesting but not all that compelling. Just didn't hook me (no pun intended). Still, as long as it's about knitting, I'll keep reading."
3,Not quite as good as the first two,"I really like this series, though this installment is the weakest so far. Make sure you read these books in order though because in this book she totally ruins the plot of the second book. I was very glad that in this book Kelly finally makes a decision about her long term future so we could get past this question and move on. I look forward to reading the next book and hope it reads more like the first two."
3,Cozy but Stilted,"I've gotten hooked on the cast of characters and their easy comradery. However, after reading 3 of them, the series is getting a little formulaic and predictable. The conversations seem stilted and people explain things over and over again. And the mysteries just aren't. Too much is explained and the conclusion becomes very obvious long before the end of the book, and not just to the reader but to the main character, too. In the end, it's all a big let down."
5,Kristina's Review,"I thought that this was a good kid's book. This book was very funny and a great story. It was just like a remix of Jack and the Beanstalk.The main reason I liked this book is because, Shaquille o' Neal is my favorite basketball player. This is really a good book for kid's of all ages."
4,Simple to use water filter,"The product came in just a few days. It was simple to set up, taking no more than five minutes. This filter takes out the taste and odor that my water has. It is a little cumbersome at the sink side at times but is well worth the money. Much less annoying than those that hang from the faucet."
4,Good for entry level and in frequent use!,Bought this for school DJ setup - good metal parts but some plastic - mouthpiece is not a solid as I wished but it will work for use of 5 or 6 times a year. Good for entry level use.
1,Beware,If you order this microphone they will send you the less expensive Nady StarPower mic whichh sells for $6.99.
5,Fits The Game Perfectly,Phenomenal music that not only brings to mind images of the famed video game but also stands alone. The movements are powerful and heart-pounding
5,An amazing soundtrack,"This is an incredible soundtrack. It's very unique in that the tracks can vary from peaceful, relaxing instrumentals, to hard rock, or to inspiring choirs. This is a must-have for fans of the game and/or the film; however, I'd definitely recommend it even for those who are neither. 5/5"
4,Second Rate,"This album is truly a must for any Rasmus fan. It's basically a ""best-of"" off their first three albums. I personally think the original Hellofacollection was better. It replaced FFFalling, Chill and Rakkauslaulu with Swimming with the Kids, WellWell and Man In the Street. If you've never heard any of their work prior to Dead Letters this is a good tester but be warned... It isn't the same sound."
4,GOOD BOOK IT HAS IT'S UPS AND DOWNS,THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK BY SILVER RAVENWOLF I READ. I'VE BEEN A WITCH FOR 5 YEARS NOW SO THIS BOOK WAS KINDA A REVIEW FOR ME. IF YOUR JUST STARTING OUT IN WICCA READ THIS BOOK! IF YOU BEEN PRACTICING FOR A WHILE THEN STILL READ IT AND JUST ADD YOUR OWN TWIST TO THE RITUALS AND SPELLS IF YOU WISH. WELL I HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY THIS WONDERFUL BOOK! BLESSED BE!
5,This book was insightful and fun at the same time.,"I am really new at all of this, but I have to say that the author has a way of really grabbing your attention and helping you understand( not to mention the fact that she is very humorous). I enjoyed reading this book and will continue to use it in the future."
3,Good discussion of quarter calls,"One strength of this book is that it treats in great detail a variety of subjects that are described briefly or mentioned only in passing in many other books. One example of this is the chapter of calling quarters, which is very detailed. As seems to be usual for Ravenwolf, a lot of information is packed into a fairly small space and (particularly in the spellwork chapters) you can pick and choose what you choose to work with at any point in time. Again, a little scattered but there's a fair amount of good, useful info in it. It was one of the the earliest easily-available books that dealt with concepts in depth."
4,One step up,I thouraly enjoyed this book and hope that silver keeps up the good work. i found it infomative and a great sequil to to ride a silver broom stick.
3,Fluffy,"This book has some good information but is a little fluffy. I highly recommend it for younger reader (early teens). Silve has a great grasp of ideas, thoughts, and practices; but appears to have geared the book for teens."
1,here we go again,"the things people will do to make a living ! the sequel to basket weaving 101, by the queen of the fluff bunnies, silver-raven-twit can not even boil water, let alone stir a magick cauldron."
1,WARNING!!!,"If you are a beginner and are interested in Witchcraft, then do yourself a favor and stay away from ALL of Silver Ravenwolf's books. Would you want to study from a so-called Witch that doesn't even live by the Rede? She is a hypocrite and her books prove it! She goes on and on and on about how the Rede says ""Harm none,"" yet she details a spell for a successful deer hunt! Wow, is hunting deer not harming it? Yes in fact the act of KILLING is indeed the act of HARMING! Ravenwolf is no different that the hypocritical christians that stand for hours in anti-abortion lines and then, when it's all over, they run to the nearest fast food restaurant for a quick burger! The only thing Ravenwolf's books are good for is kindling your fireplace!"
1,This doesn't deserve 4 stars.,Any self respecting witch would not read or recommend anything written by Silver Ravenwolf. I could explain but that would take more time than I care to spare on this review. Just use google.
4,good sequel.,"This was a very good follow-up to Silver's ""To Fly a Silver Broomstick"", with more advanced information for the practicing Witch (like advanced circle casting, energy play, different ways to raise power, etc). I recommend reading To Fly before reading this, as that will give the reader a better base of information that Silver talks about in this book. I also really liked that there was a circle casting for folk magick in this book. I heard that one didn't need a circle for folk magick, while others said that one should cast a circle for minor magicks; I'm a fan of simple, folk magick so that was ""right up my alley"", so to speak.I like this book, along with most of Silver's other work, so I was pretty glad to have this in my library. If you're a fan of Silver's or of her ""new generation witchcraft"" series, then I recommend this book to you."
5,More Indepth!,"This ""sequel"" to To Ride a Silver Broomstick, takes a shot at those critics of her first book who complained it wasn't indepth enough for them. To Stir a Magick Cauldron goes one step further...offering practical applications in casting and conjuring. The information here is valuable, and detailed. And not the easiest to learn or master...but again Silver's motherly writing style will guide you through with advise and humor. There is even a test at the end of the book that you can take to see how you're coming along. Great book, and most helpful in mastering the Magickal Arts."
4,This book is EXTREMELY detailed and should help many.,"TO Stir A Magick Cauldron is, true fairly detailed in the less-covered aspects of the craft, causing some confusion. My advice? Read it twice. I did and I now completely understand all the details and use them everywhere. This book is FICTION? The people who say this most likely are a different path than I. I have never read anything more truthful or helpful in my life. I suggest this book to anyone who wants to advance their knowledge of the craft beyond the basics."
2,"If you must buy a Ravenwolf book, buy this one","I really can't recommend this book. I'm not sure what it tries to be about... Wiccan? Nope, it's too far from any books on Wicca to be that. Traditional Witchcraft? No, it's unlike any of those works, too!Ravenwolf skirts the line between fiction and fact. I think the public deserves a new edition of this book with footnotes and qualifiers where she explains where she comes up with stuff...For beginning Non-Wiccan Witches, this book is too Wiccan to be of any use. For Wiccans, this book is too far from Wicca to be of any use.It will leave you confused, and WORSE, if you are familiar with the craft... I can only imagine what it would do to a true beginner."
2,WHO SAID THIS WAS GOOD?,the only good song on this CD is Bling Bling BG is the worst hotboy go buy the hot boy's cd instead it's lots better
4,BG is tight,BG is just so tight. He just make you think. I think yall should run and buy this cuz its real.
3,god but not tight like no limit,"this is a good cd nothing special, cash money is a good label but they dnt compare to no limit, juventile is the only one worthy of the tank"
2,I changed my mind,"uh..I was that Bill Clinton imposter. The first time I reviewed that CD was about 3 months ago. However I changed my mind after I heard some music from No Limit and Wu-Tang. Cash Money has absolutely no talent. You can argue all you want, but I think you will think a little different after you hear some Wu-Tang and east coast rap. That's where the real rappers and talent come from. CMR just repeats what No Limit says and they do it worse. No Limit is bad to the limit already so why get Cash Money. I like No Limit even though they are not very good is because their music is just too addicting. You can start listening to No Limit and forget about Cash Money(Did you know MAC and Soulja Slim from No Limit used to be in Cash Money? )."
4,"BLING, BLING","This cd is for real dog. Trigga play, cash money is an army, made man, bling bling. Those are all tight. I reccomend this cd"
4,Tight cd!,"Now I really REALLY don't like Cash Money all that much, but I decided to check out some of their stuff before I start hating on it. And I have to admit, this cd is tight! One thing about Cash Money, their production is excellent. Mannie Fresh makes great beats. Still, a lot of their lyrics need A LOT of improvement, because all they seem to rap about is all the money, jewelry, and expensive cars that they supposedly have. Nevertheless, they got some pretty good songs. My favorite songs on this cd are Cash Money Is An Army, Bling Bling, Dog A**, Thug'n, Cash Money Roll, N***az In Trouble, Trigga Play, and Play'n It Raw. This is a very tight cd from the Dirty South, with excellent production. So check this out today!"
1,You can tell the CD by this cover lol.,"This CD sucks. Some of the beats are ok but hes just like juvenile yet sounds like Lil Wayne. He wasted good beats for his elementary lyrics. Then we have the front of the case, where the words and letters are encrusted with diamonds to make it look shiny for little ignorant music fans to buy like mosquitos attract to light, a car on the front and some ugly ass dude with an object in his hand to make it seem like hes doing business.Anyone that calls B.G. the ""pinnicle of rap"" is an idiot and have NO idea about music. If you want to listen to music, go get some classic Wu-tang, classic Jay-Z and Nas, 2pac, Biggie, Big L, Big Pun, Scarface, anyone but Cash Money and No Limit aka No Talent idiots (well Lil Wayne is actually cool to me so besides him)."
3,okay,The concept is fun but the recipes weren't all that clever or useful for what I was looking for
4,"A good ""door"" to be opened by those interested for Innovation",A collection of reviews in Innovation Strategies/Policies/Theories/Practices some of them related with case studies in big companies.It can help those who want a reflexive and comprehensive look into Innovation.
1,Would be nice if the printing problem didn't exist,"Ordered this book and pages 55-88 are from some other HBR book. Therefore 2-8 essays are missing. Sent for a replacement....SAME ISSUE. Therefore, I am writing this to let you know to tread lightly as you may only get 75% of what you ordered. Had Amazon made it easy to remedy the situation (e.g. have someone hand-inspect it the third time) I would have been able to write a good review...but don't say I didn't warn you about the print run problem..."
4,Doesn't leak,"Looks clean on counter - getting ready to sell house, so 'image' is supposedly everything. Can be elegant or country kitchen...versatile design."
3,Good Case. Bad Strap.,"The case itself is great. You can fit everything you need in it (notebook, power adapter, CDs, paperwork, etc.) It's sturdy and can withstand everyday use. However, after using it for about a year, the pad on the shoulder strap is basically useless and the clip that holds the strap to the case itself broke off. For now I've connected the strap to the handle on top. Hopefully that will last until I can find a better replacement."
2,Su mejor album pero nada del otro mundo...,"Shakira tiene mucho talento, pero a mi parecer se ha vuelto muy comercial, creo que puede crecer mas como cantautora si se lo propone."
4,my first Shakira cd,"I got this cd way back when. You can really appreciate Shakira as a songwriter and guitarrist, etc.. when you hear this in comparison to her bubble gum now.Her songs are catchy and fun to listen to. Here she has a diverse collection of songs that show her talents as a singer and songwriter. One of her best cds honestly."
5,¡Quiero más!,"Creo este album por Shakira es muy bien- mejor que las otras albums ""Dónde..."" y ""Laundry Service"". ¡Compra ahora!Sorry if my Spanish is bad, but I felt that sentence summed up this album.It's an incredible journey into modern day and traditional latin pop music, and it's easily Shakira's best album to date."
5,Lion Brand Incredible yarn,"I purchased the Autumn Leaves color to knit a sweater found on the Lion Brand website. If you read the description of this yarn, it clearly states ""3/8 wide TAPE yarn"". It does take a little time to get used to knitting with this tape/ribbon yarn, but the results are well worth it. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this yarn again, for knitting or crocheting. Try it, you might like it!"
4,Wow,"After my first 24-hours with the HP f2304, I'm a very happy camper. The picture is jaw-droppingly gorgeous and crisp (after you install the monitor drivers from the included CD), the sound from the speakers is excellent, and the size is just amazing. I took off one star for the only issue I had with the monitor...the swivel on my base is a little loose, so the monitor tends to tilt forward instead of holding in the position I place it in. It holds in place if I tilt it back, but once it gets to straight vertical it seems to just drop forward. The base is removable via four screws in the back and can be replaced with another base or a wall-mount bracket, so it doesn't really reflect the quality of the monitor itself at all. Five stars for the monitor, 1 star for the base. :)"
1,What a problem,"I bought this scanner 6 months ago to replace a .. scanner that just wore out. After scanning one picture the computer lost the scanner. I would reinstall, scan one picture and lose it. The tech support was worthless they told me to unplug my other USB stuff, then they told me to reinstall the software, which was tough. No change. I bought a new computer with XP pre-loaded this machine cannot find the scanner. What a hunk of junk!"
1,Could not finish,"Did I miss something? Am I the only one who thought this book was just AWFUL?I read the first 100 or maybe more, pages. BORING! I rarely stop reading a book once I start, but this, was awful.The lesbian mother, the jerk ex boyfriend- just awful, just an awful read.I can't recall the last time I did not atleast finish a book. Why do people rave about this book?"
3,Wha' happened???,"I listened to this on CD, and the reader was excellent. Perfect. And I liked the first half of the story. But then, the California part...oy. And when she starts walking around the city, purposely past gun shops, etc. Gawd."
4,Excellent Read,"I didn't think this book would be as good as it was! Many sensitive issues were brought up and things we are all (if we are honest) worried about. Acceptance, self worth, and good values all show up in this book. I found this author to be a great writer, easy reading, and also full of humor. Loving yourself is what it is all about, and finding the love of your life when you weren't necessarily looking--right in front of you! I recommend this book as an excellent read!"
1,This Book is Definitely NOT Good Anything...,"Rarely do I review books, and I have never given a book one star, but this book was deserving of both...and not in a good way. Normally, I LOVE Jennifer Weiner's books, so I was extremely disappointed when this one turned out so poorly. The characters are uninteresting and the storyline is confusing. Cannie, the main character, is flawed and lives entirely in her past. The storyline consistently jumps around between past and present - and for the 1st time ever - I found myself actually skipping pages just to reach the end. I do not recommend buying this book. Save your money, check it out from your local library, and do not expect much."
5,Awsome. Great Easy Read,I loved this book. I really felt for the main charater Cannie. I loved reading and waiting for the next move that Cannie was about to perform. I could not put the book down until I was finished.
2,Read Jemima Jones instead,"...if you're in the market for a plus-size fairy tale. My friends and I all loved it. It isn't literature, but it's better than this."
2,homophobia is not funny,"this book had great potential, but it was completely undermined by its homophobia."
4,A funny easy read,"Not many books make me laugh out loud, but this one did. It's an easy, light and funny read."
5,Fabulous book!,"I loved this book and had to force myself to put it down! Funny and sad, with great characters! Highly recommended."
3,"Entertaining summer read, but","This is nice, light, fluffy summer reading that leaves a lingering bad aftertaste (if any at all) for a couple of reasons.One being that it doesn't quite feel internally consistent, though I can't quite put my finger on why.The other - and this is a personal pet peeve of mine - is that once, just once, I'd like to see a novel about a ""fat"" girl who's larger than a size sixteen. Sixteen isn't fat. It's normal (at least, in the States)."
4,Good in Bed Reading,I like the book and would recommend it to others. Not too deep but definitely interesting. I like the author.
4,"A little unreal, but still a good read","Although I found the story to be a little unbelieveable at times, I still enjoyed it and found that it had really good life lessons embedded in the storyline."
4,Enjoyable,Don't let the title fool ya! Not an X-rated book. Just a very enjoyable Chick Lit book. Great read for anyone with body image issues!
4,Don't judge THIS book by it's cover (or title)!,"This novel goes far beyond classic chick-lit. It has all the `benefits' of classic chick-lit (funny, motivational, deals with self esteem and body / weight issues) but it drives its message home in an very different way ... it is honest, hard-hitting but also heart-warming, and puts daily angst into perspective in a very positive way."
4,Remarkable!,"I loved this book!! Not only was it hard to put down, but it was great to be with Cannie through her ups and downs... It made me both laugh and cry!! Must read for sure!!"
4,"More serious than I expected, a light interesting story","I really didn't expect the story to be as involved as it was. It was a good book to read, very different from the norm and it kept me reading till the end."
3,Cute But a Bit of a Dud,"For the most part this is a nice easy read. The best way I can think to describe it is Bridget Jones with a weight problem and several life experiences that are outlandish and depressing all at once. The characters are all very likeable but completely simple. In any case, there are enough funny and cute moments to keep the story moving and the overall book enjoyable.Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.Suggested With: A margarita and a poolside lounge chair."
4,"If you like Jennifer Weiner, I recommed listening to this",I really enjoyed this little story. I drive a hour a day to work; and had a lot of fun listening to it. Its a no brainer kind of story but sweet and fun.
2,Why I rarely read novels any more,"This book reminded me of why I read memoirs in lieu of novels these days. It felt so contrived. Though I can see why some women will like it and relate to the character, I was groaning over ""Cannie"" (what a ridiculous name)deciding she was in love with the idiot Bruce after he wrote about her in a national magazine AND used her for sex after his father's funeral. I was about two thirds through the book when I had a strange sense that I'd read this story before. Not this novel, but the STORY and I realized it was like a rehashed ""She's Come Undone"" by Wally Lamb. I'd recommend that book over this one.Oh, and out of no where she falls in love with a character who likes her in part because Cannie reminds him of his dead sister (red flag! bad basis for a relationship!) It seemed it was just to wrap up the happy ending neatly."
3,"Good Start, but Crashes in the End","Started out pretty good, but sort of fizzled out toward the end. I agree with another reviewer who wrote, ""seemed to rush into a happy ending all of a sudden, and not a believable one."" The lack of a solid ending really left me hanging -- I like to get closure with books."
2,Could've been better,This book was an ok read. It had enjoyable moments but overall I just didn't care about the heroine of this story. I'll think twice before I buy another one of Jennifer Weiner's books.
3,Too Much Information,"While I did enjoy the story, it included too much detail about non essential things which kind of took away from the events. The timeline kept going back then forward and it took a minute to adjust to the switches.I thought it was a sweet tale tho' and the dog was my favorite charactor. I don't think I'll read this author again. I felt compelled to finish the book once started, but it wore me out in the reading."
3,Average Read,"I had high expectations with this book because of the reviews. Let's just say I expected 5 stars and I got only 3. The plot was good, but it was so narrative that there were only few lines of conversation. And also, I find it dragging and slow paced, I got bored in some part of it. But let me say what the 3 stars are for: it's for Bruce's honestly written articles, and for a few funny lines."
1,This book is awful!!,"The main character in this book is just full of self pity!! She has a very cynical, morbid outlook on life. I was really offended by her outlook on being a single parent - The Daddy Parade. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,don't expect to be entertained,"I picked up the book after reading the glowing review, describing it as ""witty,feisty and funny"", hoping that I would get entertained reading it. I was wrong, the book is anything but all that. The writing gets from Ok to bland to just plain ramblings. The almost-autobiographical-sounding rambling doesn't lend any depth to the story, it makes the book just plain annoying. it's a pain reading that book, and the only reason I finished reading it is for the ending, which I must say, for lack of a better word, boring. The only good thing about this book is the catchy title, which I think is just a marketing gimmick. Don't bother with this book, it's not worth it."
1,poorly written and unreal,Let me start by saying that this is a first time I am writing a reveiw. I really wanted to like this book but it just was not happening. I skipped through many pages. The story is very unreal and written in a very childish manner. In what planet do you meet a movie star in the bathroom and become best friends with her over night ?!?!?!?
3,"Pretty Good, Easy Read, Overall Enjoyable","I liked the book. It was entertaining, parts of it were funny, and it seemed more realistic than Jemmina J. I thought the main character was very strong. There were no real conflicts for the character in the book. She delt with the struggle to find independence, happiness, and breaking ties with a former boyfriend like many 20 something books do. I would recommend reading this book."
5,Incredible,"A great weekend book, the pages turn themselves. Not overly intense, but very REAL. I loved it."
3,I almost liked this book,"Ms. Weiner writes well, and in Cannie she has created a unique and earthy heroine. I liked the relationship with her family members, and appreciated the unsparing way Weiner described the pain caused by Cannie's first distant, then absent, father. The rage she felt during the breakup annoyed me, but that doesn't mean it didn't ring true for the character ...So what was wrong with it, you ask?HOLLY-wood! I would have enjoyed seeing how a woman in Cannie's position dealt with the decision to have her baby alone without a superstar (I pictured Jannifer Aniston) giving her financial and emotional support. I've been to Philadelphia, it's a great city and it fits Cannie's gritty personality. I wish Weiner hadn't gone the fairy tale route and kept her heroine at home."
3,"Some parts were awesome, and some... not so much","For the most part, I enjoyed this book. Although at times I found it hard to like the main character, Cannie. As a larger woman, I could completely relate to the body image issues and thought that part of the book was done flawlessly. But the main character overreacted to things, making her seem unreal, and the big climactic drama point at the end seemed over the top. An all right read, though a little frustrating at the end - and I kind of just wanted it to end."
3,This isn't chick lit!,"I thought a Princeton grad would write better than this. Or at least know the difference between 'then' and 'than' and not use 'off of'. Or maybe she should fire her editor.This isn't chick lit. It's a wall-banger. For the life of me I cannot understand why it's received such rave reviews. It's depressing and negative.The only reason it got a 3* review from me was so that amazon would print it. Oh, and a 'plus-size' friend recommended it."
2,Beach Trash,"Self-absorbed, self-pitying journalist meets celebrity in bathroom whom she instantly becomes best friends with and ultimately ends up a rich single mother who almost lost her baby in a freak accident after meet her estranged father in hollywood as her celebrity friend gets plastic surgery. Is this how she pitched the book? Were the publishers on crack? Enough said. I could have gotten more entertainment watching a soap opera; less time consuming and dare I say more realistic."
1,Pathetic,"A painful read, and I only read 100 pages at that. Is this what single thirty-somethings are like? No wonder they're single. Absolutely pathetic."
2,I just couldn't get into it.,"I try not to quit on a book and give it a chance but this one just didn't grab me at all. I only got to about page 100. Cannie was just so down on herself, yet despite that, she got through college and had enough confidence to get a good job at a major big-city newspaper. She puts her worth totally on how she looks and having a man, which is not a good message to send women. The book just doesn't have enough substance. Cannie is a whiner ----- sorry, but there are bigger issues and people with alot worse problems out there in the real world. I just didn't have any sympathy for her and felt this book was too much ""fluff"" --- I guess I just don't dig the chick-lit genre."
4,Easy Chick Lit,"I've read this book three times now just because it's a fast and fun chick lit read. It's not a book that will draw out deeper emotions - though The Pusher may bring out some genuine anger! - but for the most part, the book is entertaining and light. Yes, it definitely has a rather implausible plot and main character - but this doesn't really detract from the fun of reading it. The main character is a bit of an anti-hero in her selfish nature and the fact that she doesn't actually seem to be that good of a person (though I don't think this is the point, I think Weiner intends for Cannie to be entirely likable). But this might just be because this has been my third time reading this (to prepare to read the sequel), and it isn't the kind of book that should be read multiple times because it becomes easy to nit-pick at its flaws. But I definitely had a great time reading it the first time around, so just don't overthink it, I guess! And I am really looking forward to the sequel!"
4,Who can't identify with Cannie?,"OUCH! To be a plus-size woman is hard enough, but to have your ex write about your love life in a magazine column is ridiculous! Cannie is a very real, witty and sympathetic character. Good in Bed goes beyond your average beach-read, although it is a quick easy book to devour."
1,Boring Bridget Jones Wannabe,"I cannot understand why this book is so popular. It was horrible! The main character, Cannie, spends all her time obsessing about her father who abandoned her, her loser boyfriend that she broke up with, and her weight. It was hard for me to finish this book, it was so boring. It was the worse kind of chick lit masquerading as some sort of girl power anthem. Weiner borrows liberally from Sex and the City and Bridget Jones, not to mention ""Maxi Ryder"", a thinly veiled characterization of Minnie Driver. After reading this book i had written Weiner off as a horrible writer, but I have read In Her Shoes since and it was truly a good book. Everything that her debut was not."
2,Not Great In Bed,"I don't get the Jennifer Weiner hype at all. I have read all her books and to me they are very repetitious (not just because some of her characters cross over in the novels, like Cannie from this one, for example) but the plotline, ""problems"" and characters are all the same. And you can see the happy ending coming from a mile away...For me, this is the best of the bunch but I found it stretched the bounds of credibility. I can't imagine a Hollywood star acting the way Maxi Ryder does but then this is fiction - fluffy, frivolous, forgettable fiction. Read it only if you are really bored and you have absolutely nothing else to do."
2,Wonderful Story Idea...Why Couldn't I Stay Interested?,"Plump, pretty and witty, dumped by her boyfriend, abandoned by her father, loved by her dog, a nagging late in life lesbian mother, a bestfriend that always finds the wrong man, co-worker threatened by her skills and personality, fast friendship with a pop singer/movie star. I thought this would be one of those books that would suck me in and I would read it straight through. The only thing that kept me reading was the thought it HAS to get good soon. It didn't. Sigh..........."
2,A Delight Becomes a Disappointment,"I was absoutely thrilled with the first few chapters of this book. I was smiling in delight at discovering such a character as Cammie, and enjoying reading about her life, her friends, her wonderful smart perspective on life. I started thinking that this was going to be my best read of the year. And then the book took an abrupt detour. Suddenly the book changed into something I'd read many times before, or seen in some cliched movie of the week. The delight of the first chapters became disappointment, maybe even more disappointing than if it had just been a mediocre book all along. This book could have been terrific, something special, and instead it was just another book about a character who finds fame and fortune but who really just wants to be a mom. The last chapters were so impersonal they could have been written about any character, and the unique voice from the early chapters wasn't there at all."
1,MOST DISAPPOINTED,"Book took 16 days to arrive (only 3 states away) and it was LARGE print, which wasn't disclosed in sales description. Most disappointed, I returned it."
4,Great novel!,"This book took me a little longer than usual to read but it's still good. I didn't realize it was so long (longer than most novels) but then again, there were enough plot twists to keep it interesting. Cannie isn't your typical heroine, being that she's got a few extra pounds on her. But in the end, everything's as it should be and that's what matters. The main plot twist was completely unexpected; I totally did not think that would happen (I don't want to spoil it for any potential readers). I highly recommend this book and can't wait for Jennifer Weiner's next novel."
2,"Not up-to-date, and often wrong","Some things in this book are very useful, notably the interviews. However, this book is fairly out-of-date, and doesn't reflect the state of the art for speech recognition technology. The section on linguistics is wrong more often than right, and wouldn't add much to the reader's understanding of designing speech interfaces even if the errors were corrected. While I think that the authors' knowledge of user interface design, in general, is solid, their experience with speech is less so. For example, in the interview with Kate Dobroth (which is really the highlight of the book for me) the authors/editors consistenly transcribe the term ""n-best"" as ""end best"" pointing to the authors' inexperience with the technology."
4,Very Good,"I thought this book to be relatively good. However, I would not reccomend it as a book for beginners. It does have some very complex material that is probably best if you have already studied paganism. Also, the author did have a tendency to go off topic."
3,"Cute, but the paint rubs off with use","I really do like this collection, but I think there is something wrong with the paint. We have a family of 6 and this is in the main bathroom, therefore it gets a lot of use. However that being said, I really do not think the paint should rub off with normal use. I also have the soap dish and the paint on that has washed off since it has gotten wet and had soap in it. These things are what they are used for and I am rather disappointed to see with normal wear the paint does not hold up very well. My final thought is that for the price you pay you should at least be able to get your use out of money."
2,Definately not the cartoon version,"I was waiting with baited breath for this movie to come out, only to be severly disappointed.I believe one of the main draws of the original series was the over the top sexual inuendos and outfits, which none existed in the movie. I am a big fan of Charlise Theron and consider her a good looking woman, but they could have found someone who exudes sexy-ness alot more than she does. The action was ok but have seen better in B class movies. If you are a big fan of the cartoon series than you will probably be very disappointed in this movie. In short ..they took an MA or strong R rated cartoon and made it into a pg-13 movie...not impressed at all"
2,A very fleeting experience,"Aeon Flux doesn't have a bad story. It also has good actors, especially Charlize Theron, of course. But every good scene of the film is being killed a few moments later, with a ridiculous action scene or, even worse, a stupid comment. With a little bit more logic (okay, a lot more logic) and some optimization of the story line, this could have become a nice flick, indeed."
1,Waste of Time & Money,"Save your money and time, even you like some of the actors, the movie is a pure flunk!!!"
3,average,"After hearing terrible reviews and comments saying that this was the worst movie of all time, i figured I would buy it and probably like it. (One critic complained that she was sneaking around while wearing a bright white uniform. Yes she was... while hiding in a bright white building!!! Its called camouflage people. Black outfits dont make you invisible.) Anyway... The movie does explain why, in the animated series, she can die and be back the next show and why she and goodchilde are enemies at times and lovers at others. There were a couple plot twists too but overall the movie seemed a little too stiff. I wanted to really like it and ended up wishing I had just rented it. Still, it wasn't bad, just not great."
3,Aeon Flux,"When I saw the preview to this movie, I said it would be worth a look. I first watched this movie and put it away after half an hour. It was boring and really didnt have the action I was hoping. I recently watched the hole movie and pretty impressed with it. There are a few fight scenes that are good, but the story seems deva ju to me. Still its worth watching once."
3,Intersting with action,"This was a good movie, although I think more background/history of the storyline should have been provided. Overall I would recommend."
4,Great futuristic sci-fi thriller,I greatly enjoyed this movie. Good acting with an interesting storyline that really kept me intrigued through out the movie. Lots of action kept it upbeat while being drawn in by the suspense & mystery of the storyline with the added spice of romance.
4,A real action heroine,"Should you be someone who likes female action heros who are real pleasing to the eye, this movie will be a treat for you. The costumes worn by the actors to depict the era of the movie is most interesting. This movie is entertaining and the plot is not bad at all. I do not regret purchasing this DVD. I have watched it quite a few times. Anyone who likes the movie Equilibrium may find Aeon Flux worth watching."
4,"Suprisingly Enough, I liked Aeon Flux!","I thought the movie was going to be terrible, but I found myself enjoying it quite a lot. It has a look that stays true to Peter Chung's Animated Series, even though that tone it down for PG-13, and Charlize Theron wasn't too bad as Aeon Flux ( even though I think Rhonda Mitra would've been perfect for the role.) I really loved Graeme Revell's score to the movie, gotta get the soundtrack. All in all, I liked it."
2,Sterile and Silly,"First, Theron wears the same outfit the entire movie, it's sexy for the first three minutes. Second, she's a cold blooded killer, but can't kill the guy she's sent to kill because...they were lovers!!! Like, nobody knew this BEFORE they sent her to kill him? And there's all the flips though the air, and impossible martial arts, it's like a typical Chinese martial arts film. It's about $5 overpriced for the $2.99 I paid to rent it. Oh well, live and learn. As a side note, I've yet to see a Charlize Theron movie I liked. In my not so humble opinion, she is a grossly overrated actor. Hot does not equal good."
3,"I finally knew what was going on in Aeon Flux, and I didn't care","Back in the day...or if you prefer the Star Wars style intro ""a long time ago in a galaxy far far away"", MTV used to show almost nothing but music videos. Occasionally, they would put something incredibly progressive that was also quite popular (see Bevis and Butthead, for example). Aeon Flux was one such animated series.The problem was, true to Asian style anime, the stories were so disjointed you had no freaking clue what the heck was going on. You just sort of sat back and watched and said ""cool"" a lot when something happened.Flash forward to this movie, and you get the ""cool"" factor of old, and you finally get what the heck is going on in this world. Alas, the 'ho-hum' of the story makes it so you don't really even care. Check this out for the great special effects and enjoy the style and action. Pass if you're looking for a true nod to Aeon."
3,"Like Aeon, I'm torn","As you've read in other reviews, this movie cannot be compared with the animated series. That having been said, it was worth seeing once just because the locations and costumes were so cool. But the story was just too conveniently tied up, and Trevor was recast as a thoroughly virtuous goody-goody who happened to have an evil brother (I'm surprised he wasn't an evil twin). It would have been tough to make the animated series into anything cohesive, but the characters in this film are just too nice, too Hollywood, not believable. Even Aeon has lost her sadistic streak. And Peter Chung okayed all this, according to the ""extras"" on the DVD! Not a great movie, but well-made mindless entertainment (probably not for the hardcore Flux fan)."
4,Old MMO but still fun.,"In some ways Everquest hasn't changed all that much, while in others it is a completely different game from what it was even a year ago. Some things about the game have been drastically improved (like tradeskills) and if you like a more quiet atmosphere on a game server; the population is a little lower these days as most of the kiddies have moved on to World of Warcraft, EQ2, etc.If you have friends still playing the original Everquest, or are just looking for something to do to pass the time, EQ Titanium just might work for you.This packaged game does include 10 of the expansions, more than enough to play with old buddies if you've taken a leave of absence like I did a little over a year ago. The price is the major factor for this unit, as the expansions individually do not come cheap.Overall 4 stars for affordability, 4 stars for fun factor (There aren't as many people to play with, making the game just a bit slower paced for casual gamers.)"
2,"Everquest used to be fun, but not anymore","I went back to the game after being gone for 3 years and was sorely disappointed. It was like visiting a ghost town. Aside from PoK, most zones were near empty. Finding anyone to group with was difficult or impossible. Sadly, I quit after a few weeks and I'll probably never go back again."
4,Good Product,"This is an excellent product, works fine and has all the features, wi-fi, 3g, second camara for videocall, etc. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little bit too big compare to others."
1,Wrong printing of the dvds,The films are not burned on the good discs. It means that each film has a wrong name written on the disc. Too bad.
2,Poor quality,These chairs were damaged in shipping. Pieces of the seat chipped off. The color variation between chairs are very noticeable. One of the chair has different shade of white. The seat has a creamy white while the rest of the chair has a frost white color. Two of them have holes under the top rail. It is as if it was drilled for a different pattern. I am going to return them and get my money back. Amazon is very good with their return policy and that was why I took the chance and order furniture online.
2,disappointed,"I am disappointed with this video. Her mic doesn't pic up her voice very well and so hearing her over the music is often difficult. There are times when you must look up to see what she's doing because she doesn't always do a very good job of cueing. The stretches are OK. I rarely do this video and instead continue to use a video I have had for many years called ""Pure and Simple Stretch"" by Karen Voight."
3,Not the best collection,"This disc features all of Carr's Latin hits up through the early '80s. A nice set, but subsequent discs (""The Best,"" for instance) render this obsolete."
4,Re: Dance moms,"Like Toddlers and Tiaras, it's something to watch when you desire mindless entertainment.....like when you want to unwind at the end of the day."
1,Bad dance Moms,"I can not stand the shows about mothers being helicopters in their daughters lives to excel at dance, cheer, or pagents. I really don't like to see people make such big errors to a young child's life. This is a form of child abuse in my mind."
4,dance moms review,I think it's good because it's funny and she embarrases herself by yelling at the kids. What a Dance Company!!!
1,This is a reality nightmare,"I think this is the worst show on television, next to all those redneck reality shows. Abbey Lee Miller and her clients' mothers are among the most pathetic of humans and none of them should have been allowed to ever be around children. Abbey Lee Miller is just a big woman with a large mouth that just angles for a fight. The moms are self-absorbed and clearly are in this for the attention and seem to care more about exposure than their own children. To say you watch this as a guilty pleasure is an affront to humanity because there is nothing of merit on this show. Children get exploited for the adults' pleasure and to say you enjoy this means you truly are not looking at the greater picture. The kind of world these young girls are thrust into is a horrible one and I would be calling a social worker to have most of these girls removed from their parents. Shame on anyone who says this is great entertainment."
5,great player,"Pro: This is a great mp3 player and is very compatible and easy to use. There are so many features that is packed into this machine that you know you are definitely getting your money's worth. Pictures, video, music and an av output so u can play it on your tv. Charge time with an av adapter is about 1hour from empty to full, about 5 with the usb cable that's included. I found out that the psp charger fits just right if you already have a psp.Con: The device is rather bulky but is alright if u just want to carry it around in your pocket. Its not very good if u wanna work out or something like that. I got the 60gb player and had a lot of trouble getting a skin for it. Most skins are only available for the 30gb device. Also, not compatible with mp4 (very dissappointing).Conclusion: Great device if you wear loose clothing (so you can leave the player in your pocket)."
1,No Good,"After having 2 replacements under warranty, the last one died a couple of weeks ago aswell. Unfortunatly this one was no longer under warranty (2 years old). I have allways been very carefull with it so it never has been dropped or anything like that, but apparently it now has a broken harddrive. On the internet I have seen that lot's of people have (had) the same problem."
4,Versatile,"I admit it, I'm not an iPod fanatic, but I can see why iPod is so popular, it's a great product, but my new Creative Zen Vision:M 60 GB is great product too.When I was shopping for my new MP3 player I had clear I needed something that could fit my growing music collecion (25 GB and counting), could record meetings, hear radio, and watch videos I get from my PVR.Well, the Zen does all this for a very reasonable price."
3,Horrible Interface Design,"I loved all my prior Creative MP3 players so I thought I'd give this one a try...and I'm still regretting it. The interface and touch pad on this thing are awful...this design is totally brainless. Navigating to songs/artists is much more difficult than with any other mp3 player i've ever used. Do yourself a favor and pick up an Ipod...I know I will next time (and I hate apple).Oh, yeah, the sound quality and storage are great, no problems there."
4,Great overall product,"I really do like this product--especially for the price. My skin is so much smoother and even. AND it literally feels like a baby's bottom. :) It doesn't erase wrinkles, of course, but it greatly improves the appearance of your skin."
3,A good book that no one's heard of,"The story line is a little far-fetched, but somewhat plausible. It is a fun book to read. The characters are fun to read and the plot is pretty good, too. Not the best book in the world, but worth reading if you're bored some winter day."
3,"Thought-provoking, but flawed","An interesting book, but at times a bit far-fetched. His statistics are well documented and helpful, but his theoretical answers to many questions are curious. Theory is just that -- theory. No more, no less."
1,The pity of this book,"This book meanders all over the place, from some history and literary critique to economics. Ferguson indulges in long tracts with endless figures to reach highly doubtful conclusions. Mostly, he likes to shoot down other people's theories with a mass of facts and figures, yet his own conclusions are based on extremely sketchy evidence. Some examples of his conclusions: the Kaiser was not responsible for leading Germany into war and the war went on because men weren't tired of fighting. I think I can pretty much guarantee that given a choice, 99.99% would've voted to go home."
2,Another Academic Wonderland,"To make a reputation in the world, one has to come up with new ideas. Sometimes they are closer to Hitler's BIG LIE than anything else.While there is much interesting in the book, he fails to convince. After all, the Germans still invaded a neutral country. This area was also one that England had fought for before. I could go on but one more point must be presented.Perhaps it was destiny that Germany become the dominant nation of Europe and the First World War only delayed the results. But the liberal, democratic society of today is better than the aggressive, insecure German nation that existed in 1914."
4,"Challenging, fun, and educational too!","If you have a sharp eye and great memory, or just need to build some brain cells, this one is for you! I enjoyed many hours (yes, hours) of intense concentration while putting this beautiful puzzle together. It certainly helped clear my mind at the end of a stressful or hectic workday! Additionally, I learned quite a lot of geography I must have missed playing hooky back in high school."
1,I reinstalled Paperport 8,"For many years I have used Paperport at home in conjunction with Quicken, scanning receipts, utility bills, etc., and attaching the scanned document to the Quicken register item it pertains to. (I am using Quicken 2001 Deluxe.) This was one of the primary things I'd do with Paperport. Unfortunately, Paperport 10 does not seem to function with Quicken, and as near as I can tell by web surfing, this holds true for newer versions of Quicken as well. The minute I installed Paperport 10 (and it uninstalled Paperport 8) all the linked documents in my Quicken file disappeared! There was no longer an icon on the bottom of the page to export a scanned document to Quicken.For many people, this may not be an issue, but for me it was a deal-breaker. I uninstalled the thing and reinstalled Paperport 8."
1,NO NEED UPGRADE FROM VER 9 TO 10,"I HAVE USED PAPERPORT FOR MANY YEARS IN OUR INSURANCE AGENCY. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH ALL THE VERSIONS INCLUDING VERSION 9 WE HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH THE FEATURES. WE SCAN ALL OUR DOCUMENTS AND PHOTOS INTO OUR NETWORK SERVER FOR ARCHIVING. WE HAVE GIVEN AWAY ALL OF OUR PAPER FILE DRAWERS. I PURCHASED VERSION 10 TO TRY IT OUT. I UNINSTALLED IT AND REINSTALLED VERSION 9 PROFESSIONAL THE SAME DAY. VERSION 10 HAS A SINGLE MACHINE INSTALLATION VERIFICATION PROCEDURE THAT YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE OF THIS PRODUCT IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. OTHER THAN THAT, IF YOU CAN GET IT INSTALLED AND CAN AFFORD TO PURCHASE A PROGRAM FOR EACH AND EVERY MACHINE YOU OWN, THEN OK. OTHERWISE I WILL STICK WITH VERSION 9."
2,Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML (Head First),The light and somewhat humorous presentation made a serious subject very easy to learn - - not just another computer book. Well done. 5 Stars. -Bill
4,XHTML with CSS,"Good book, nice visual style, kind of jumps around on the topics, though.Presents the information well, helps you make simple, solid, styled websites.Great for beginners.Not much on dynamic content, maybe try this:Head First JavaScript"
1,Over designed,"The book was heavily cluttered with imagery, so much so that it was not the most enjoyable of books to read. I found the constant doodles, tips, and just about everything on the page took you away from reading the actual information that was presented to you as the reader. I don't mind illustrations, but they were too cumbersome and too plentiful. I know if they had decreased the amount of distractions in this book it would be much more of an enjoyable book to read and understand. However, we all learn differently and I am not ""bad mouthing"" the author's; just some honest information I think is relevant to know."
5,Great,"I got this item within a few days as was what I paid for so that's great. The book itself looks brand new so that's good too. Overall, great job thanks."
1,Scattered,"This is a book of CSS for those who can't concentrate on just one thing at a time. It's scattered, strangely organized, and filled to brimming with little notes, pictures, graphics, and comics. I hated the layout of this book and can only imagine it's for people who have to multitask, even when they're reading a book.This was not a book I could learn from."
5,Easy and entertaining,"This book provides a step-by-step walk through of HTML and CSS that is both easy to understand and entertaining. This book truly does a lot of hand holding to make sure you understand every detail (or readily acknowledges details that aren't important to understand), which makes it faster and easier to read for those without experience. Even though this book has more pages to read than other books on the subject, you'll read those pages faster than you could any other reference because the authors anticipate all of your questions and answer them at the moment you think of them. With engaging examples that are easy to download (some of these books have online references that are impossible to find, this is not one of them), you'll be generating web pages in no time."
5,Fantastic read for introductory web programmers,"I have been developing for the web for years now and recently began teaching an introductory course at the collegiate level. Though the students had their reservations about the format of the book (somewhat childish), they soon found that it was absolutely perfect for learning the material in a fast and fun manner."
2,"Lots of Info, but Confusing","My instructor had this book as our text book. It has a lot of good info, but it's all jumbled together in a giant cluttered mess. Taking tests with this book was a nightmare as I really couldn't pin down the answers to the questions. I am ordering other HTML/XHTML CSS books to fill in the gaps where this one left off. I need organized facts and examples, easy to find answers. Not this garbled mess of cutesy crap that just takes away from the mass of good info it DOES have. I give it two stars for the good information it holds, but it lost 3 stars because it's just such a messy book of nonsense that I had a difficult time sifting through."
5,A modern way to read a book.,This book is written with a lot of images. It makes it a lot easier to remember the stuff you read. Everything is very easy and straight forward. A great book for newcomers but not recommended for those who are already into webdesign. Though if youre interested about lecturing a class this book might come in handy with a lot of good and more modern ideas about teaching ;)
4,FIRST MOVIE WITH JAMES REMAR AS A GOOD GUY!,"I saw this movie in the late 1980's and it was not too bad. I was surprised to find out who was in charge of the drug operation at the end. The music was pretty good and so was some of the action. I like the bar scene with Remar and that fat jerk, that was kind of funny! Oh, the lead actor James Remar was on 48 Hrs and the Rennassiance Man with Danny Devito. It's just hard to picture James Remar as the good guy, because he has always played the bad guy one movies...kind of like John Travolta's action movies."
3,Misleading with packaging,I must also comment on packaging. I ordered this same product last year and it was shipped just like the picture. But now it comes in a brown box (which was terribly bent up). Now I have to figure out some way of making a gift basket to give it away as a Christmas gift.
2,Good Lord !,If you have a choice between going to the dentist for a root canal or reading this book by all means don't miss your dental appointment.
1,I gave it a chance,"I read this book about 1/4 of the way through and the whole time I felt like I had some kind of confused grimace on my face. I understand how maybe someone who feels stuck in a monotonous existence might benefit from reading this book, but as someone who is comfortable with her personality, I found the book very contradictory to how I live my life. I'll return to it some other time to see if maybe I had just misread some of it, but as of right now, I thoroughly disliked the book."
2,Big Disappointment,"The concept of reinventing oneself is highly intriguing... however, I never felt I got to the ""meat"" of the proposition. Chandler's voice is very monotone - I found my mind wandering too often, therefore I had to rewind frequently. I don't think my money or time was well spent with this one."
2,stupid book,This was a stupid book and I got very little out of it. There is nothing new in it that hasn't been said many times in many books before or just dah-common sense. Marketing ploy. Waste of money.
1,Truly awful,"I'm wondering if the other reviewers here actually read the same book I did? My book club selected this novel based on the glowing reviews here (and the tag lines from all Ms. Goldmark's friends on the back of the book -- shame on you, Roddy Doyle and Amy Tan!!). I have yet to talk to someone who enjoyed it. The Amazon reviewer is being more than fair -- it's predictable, the plot is loopy, and the song lyrics throughout the book are practically unbearable. I figured out by the 10th page that I'd need to skip them if I wanted to finish the darn thing.Further, Ms. Goldmark may be a country music ""insider,"" but I didn't get that feel from the novel. Most of the characters are immediately recognizable stereotypes: the self-absorbed big star, the greedy record producer, the citified record industry folk. Hilarity ensues."
5,Balalaika: Russia's Most Beautiful Tunes,"While visiting an annual Bazaar at a Russian Orthodox church in Hartford, CT, on November 4, 2007, I heard this music playing in the background, and was compelled to inquire about the CD. It is absolutely gorgeous to listen to, and some of the songs I recognized very well. What I heard is beautifully played, with all the emotion one could hope for in listening to this type of music. I'm not inclined by ancestry or in any other way, to be favoring it--just know something good when I hear it."
1,Not appropriate for the little ones,"The violent themes in this book are a bit rough for the 3-4 year olds. When looking for early readers, I would try to make it age appropriate and not trying to keep true to the greek mythology."
5,"positive reinforcement, yeah!",-Great for positive reinforcement when I'm checking my answers on homework-Fun little stickers to randomly put on your friends-Reminds me of a simpler time
1,Waste of time,"The dvd transfer looks o.k. the colors or good, but some scenes do have some dirt specs and scratches.Now the movie totally sucks. The editing is awful and the production and acting is very much like (1971)Frankenstein vs. Dracula movie. There are 2 sex scenes that were in this movie when I saw it at the movie theater back in the 1970's. Those scenes are not in the movie. The all star monster lineup looks like this. Frankenstein monster looks like Glen Strange monster rubber mask with Fu Manchu mustache and goatee. The wolfman looks like your average homeless man with fangs. The Mummy is a skinny man wrapped in brand new hospital bandages. The vampires look like Party City costumes. There is a midget, hunchback mad doctor who looks like Mariano Rivera. The music score is a annoying organ which is played a lot.You can see scenes of this movie on YOUTUBE.The fight scenes are nothing to write home about."
5,want to escape this angry world???,"Put this in the CD player and chill out will succumb you immediately.... Beam me up Scotty with these sounds. This place is, still, even after all these years, way too primitive ... Need a peaceful planet and this is the transporter to get me there."
5,Wonderful movie!,This is a wonderful movie! Cant say enough good things about it. Teaches integrity and selflessness through the examples of the characters. Bought it for the girls and I but the guys found they enjoyed it as well.
4,The Inheritance,"This a great family movie for those sick of violence, blood, mayhem and foul language. A pleasure to view and relaxing to watch. Pure entertainment."
2,No story line!,There was really no story to be told here. Meredith Baxter wasn't a good cast for this role and it was quite boring not holding my interest at all!
3,Pretty but slow...,"I ordered this movie, hoping for something like Mansfield Park. It was pretty to look at, had the right elements, but the story was very slow and tiresome. My eight year old granddaughter will like it if she has the patience. In order to get five stars from me it has to have great music, a great story, beautiful scenery, and at one point make me cry. This one only scores for music and scenery. *sigh* If you are desperate for a period piece, it's better than nothing, but dont expect Jane Austen style brightness."
4,Great Period Piece,"If you love period movies with a happy ending, this is for you. Nice set, wonderful costumes, and great acting, all lead to a fantastic night of romance watching."
1,Baaad Movie,"My wife rented this period piece and we watched it together, unfortunately between episodes of the elegant ""Downton Abbey"" which we had DVR'd from PBS. What a contrast between the two in terms of the quality of the storyline, the acting, the sets, the costumes, etc! Without spoiling this for anyone, let me say that a major character dies about 2/3 through the movie, and we immediately speculated that it was the bad screenwriting that had killed him!"
2,Not happy!,"I was looking forward to viewing this movie, but was incredibly disappointed when the movie started playing and there was NO closed-captioning or English subtitles!! I ended up giving this movie away to my mother who loves Louisa May Alcott. Amazon needs to correct their error as it is very misleading. If you are a deaf or hard-of-hearing person, please do NOT get this movie."
5,Wonderful Period Piece,"If you love period movies, you will love this story. The fact that it is an american movie and not a british one takes nothing away from the effect it will have on your heartstrings. The story is a underlying romance that has a ""Cinderella"" theme. A story of one individual's unselfish actions for those she loves. The house is amazing and as big as it is, you can feel the love of those who live there. You will also despise the one individual that trys to destroy the life of another. It is a consumate example of the saying, ""what goes around comes around."" The actors were superbly chosen for the roles they play."
2,Wasn't Crazy About This One...,"Based on the ""lost novel"" of the same name by Lousa May Alcott, The Inheritance chronicles the life of Edith Adelon, an orphan who is given an opportunity to live with a wealthy couple (Tom Conti and Meredith Baxter) as their daughter's companion. Edith proves herself a formidable entry into a rather cold and unwelcoming upper-class society and soon catches the eye of a wealthy gentleman played beautifully by Thomas Gibson.I absolutely love period pieces and it's very rare that I come across one don't like, but this one was absolutely terrible. Meredith Baxter was unfortunately miscast (as was 3/4 f the actors in ths movie; I couldn't stand watching her play this role. She looks great, but her dialogue forced, and her acting was mediocre to say the least, making the entire effort very difficult to watch. I felt as if I was watching Dynasty in Regency gowns. Sorry, If you like period pieces, take your chances..."
3,Nice Story,"If you don't expect the best acting and don't mind a formula movie, then this is the right movie for you. It is a sweet innocent family film which is getting harder to find. Certainly not a well produced film but a good Christian film nonetheless. For the price, it's a great one to own! I will watch it over again. If you really want a good film and beautifully produced with great acting then get BBC's ""North & South"", ""Wives and Daughters"" or the newest ""Jane Eyre"". You may also want to see ""Under the Greenwood Tree"" or ""The Woman in White""."
5,great movie,I love peroid peices and it was right down my alleyit was believeable I loved the actors and all
5,The Inheritance,Such a refreshing presentation of Louisa Alcott's other book. I felt her writing style while watching and choice of cast was great. Highly recommend this to anyone who is a romantic and enjoys happy endings. Tom Conti was even comforting in his death which normally is a depressing part of most movies. My hat's off to all involved with this movie! Sue M.
3,"Entertaining, but not like the book","This wasn't like the book at all! Besides that,Percy's character seems really shallow. There isno sustenance to his person. He merely exists tomake the girls in the audience melt. Other than that,great movie."
3,language,"loved the plot and excellent performances in this film. However, too much use of the name of God in vain. I have seen an edited version by feature films for families, and it was much better - same actors, plot and all - just none of the language."
4,The Inheritance,"A period piece done beautifully. It was simply wonderful, beautiful scenery, authentic sets, lovely costumes. I was surprised at how good the acting and story was. It should be called The Surprise:)!"
4,loved it - great movie,great move of a story by louisa may alcott - no violence. no sex. just romance. you can watch it with the whole family
5,Marvelous!,"This is a marvelous movie for those who love period pieces and are romantics at heart. There are obstacles to overcome. The heroine of the story is an upright, moral, sweet lady who thinks of others above herself. There was nothing in the movie to make you come away with an icky feeling (no sex scenes, violence, or foul language that I recall). It is an all-around feel-good kind of movie. I loved it!"
3,Fun,"This is a fun story about two young Britons whose village is devastated by Angles, one is the chief's heir, the other is a freeman who has ambitions to be a warrior. Both are brought low through this attack and have to become friends as they travel post-Roman Britain looking for safety and then joining the warriors of Eboracom. In turn they learn the value of alliances and the part love plays in their lives."
2,Good product but awful packing by Amazon,Two items were damaged because there was no padding/protection in the box by Amazon. I'd call that a real LOUSY job.
5,An original and candid novel,"Set in a small French village in the year 1372, Mirabilis is Susann Cokal's debut novel and the story a village wet-nurse who holds the key to saving the town from famine - an especially striking act of generosity, since the people of her home are responsible for locking her mother, two priests suspected of being her father, and all the village women who believed her conception to be immaculate within a church and burning it. Dubbed ""God's bastard,"" she carries on the rode to sainthood among ascetics, mystics, lovers, and jesters. Mirabilis is an original and candid novel, unafraid to reveal the ridiculous between extremes, as well as the cruel melding of hypocrisy and piety that so often brings suffering. Highly recommended reading!"
1,I don't recommend it,I had been using this toothpaste for a while when I started developing tonsilitis. If you search blue or green algae you'll see that it is also called cyanobacteria.
1,Did not fit my fireplace,"Before I bought this plug I thought it was kind of strange that other people either loved it or said it didn't work. I see now why that is. If you have a fireplace that has a damper handle sticking down into the fireplace below the damper (like mine) you do not want this plug because it wont work. The handle will get in the way. Fortunately, i bought it from Home depot so i was able to return it.The package says ""can be used in any fireplace"" but it is not possible for it to seal if you have a damper handle in the way. I am going to try the different type of chimney balloon that goes in above the damper, or I might just stuff the damper with fiberglass."
1,BORING!!!,This was the first Karen Harper book I have read and it was so boring. I skipped pages and pages to just find out who were the bad guys and get to the end of the book. I am not sure if I would read another Karen Harper book. Thank goodness this was passed on to me and didn't waste my own money on it. Don't bother reading this one.
3,Good album but rather redundant,"A good album with lots of emotion and fairly good musicianship. Good tunes like here without you and away from the sun are the high points. This band is a bit redundant but holds on to keep me interested. It's hard to find much variety from song to song. Overall, okay album and I tend to listen to it quite a bit."
4,3 Doors Down definitely strikes gold again!,"After creating an incredible cd like The Better Life with great hits like Not Enough, Be Like That, So I Need You, Better Life, and of course Kryptonie and Loser, one would think that a rookie band like 3 Doors Down would have nothing left to put into a new album. But thats just not true. Away from the sun continues on where the Better Life left off. Although the speed has been reduced on some songs, the melodies and hooks are still there, as well as that super crunch blasting from Matt's Ibanez guitars. Notable songs are Going Down in Flames, my personal favorite and soon to be the best 3 Doors Down song in my opinion, Here Without You is another great slow song reminscent of Be Like That. When I'm Gone and Dangerous Game are also new classics. All in all, another great album from this band, definitely worth picking up."
4,Another solid effort by 3 Doors Down...,"I heard ""When I'm Gone"" last week on The Tonight Show and immediatly knew the album would be good. I don't usually get my hopes up like that for an album, but after their first album, I was excited about the 2nd. Their first is truly a classic, a 5 star album. This one gets 4 stars, in my opinion, because it simply wasn't as good as the first, but that's not to say it still wasn't an enjoyable album. They will certainly retain their fan base, and even gain a few more fans.My only dislike, however, was in a few songs they seem to try to sound like Creed. That may be a major mistake, if it was intentional. What was so invigoriating about their first album was their relaxed, original sound. Trying to immitate a popular favorite is always a bad mistake.Overall I enjoyed this album and highly recommended it. Again, I look forward to 3 Doors Down's next release."
3,Typical Sophomore Slump...,"I listened to this CD in hopes of having another great album like The Better Life that housed not only ""Kryptonite"" but also ""Loser"" and many other great songs. Instead, I found this sophomore effort leaning more towards an acoustic tone which is fine except it's very very difficult to differentiate any of the songs on the album (tracks 1-3 blended together to me). Not that they are bad but not even the lyrics really make the songs distinct. However, there are some shining tracks on this album with ""This Time"" and ""Here Without You""...both tracks seem different from previous material on the debut CD or even on this new album. The album's not bad but it's not a hot hit like The Better Life is to listen to from beginning to end...hopefully, 3 Doors Down will stick to a varied formula more on the next album rather than being almost monotonous on this album with the same guitar rifts and similar lyrics."
2,Ehhhh..........,my mom bought me this for christmas and i didnt really want it but i still have it .......................... somewhere. The best and hardest track is #1 When I'm Gone. I think that's what the songs called.........
2,"I'm here without it, baby","And I don't want to touch this album, it sounds like everything else baby, thats on the radio aaalll the time, I'm here without this album baby, because of its mediocre songs, and yes I have heard them aaaalll. Some songs are okay, like the radio hit ""When I'm Gone"", these songs are overplayed baby, on the radio 24/7, so its not worth buying the CD!!!"
2,"Beware, not really an audio CD","Although I like the songs, I had to return this item to Amazon. It is not really an audio CD (it does not display the CD logo that all audio CD's have on their jewel case). This is because Universal is formatting the disk using a copy protection scheme. I discovered it won't play on my system. I could play it on other systems (like my windows NT terminal at work), but not my home system (windows xp). The protection is very hit and miss. It seems to only prevent playing on certain operating systems and only on cd drives. If you are using a Mac, older operating system (windows me, windows nt) or a dvd rom, the disk ought to play fine. (kinda makes you wonder why they bother if the protection is so limited). Just be forewarned, the disk may be incompatible for you as it was for me."
4,"Different, but likeable","Different sound, different type of music. If you liked the first one, don't count on the same sound. But either way it is a solid CD of something new from them. Which is better than the same old garbage. There is a few outstanding tracks on the record, including the effortless ballad of HERE WITHOUT YOU. Good stuff, along with When I am Gone, The Road I am ON, Away From the Sun, and Changes...Good stuff, a good buy if wondering, looking for hardcore, look for something else."
4,Good time,"I'm pretty much a country music fan, but I got this 3 Doors Down CD after their concert at a NASCAR race in Michigan. This CD has a good mix of mellow songs (""Here Without You"" and ""Away From the Sun"") and rockers (""Goin' Down in Flames"" and ""Sarah Yellin'""). ""Dangerous Game"" has almost a disco vibe to it, especially at the beginning and ""The Road I'm On"" has a great positive message. My very favorite song is ""When I'm Gone"", it is well-written and performed. This is a great hanging out and doing nothing CD!!"
3,Good Post-Grunge,"There's really very few Post-Grunge bands that are good. 3 Doors Down is one of them. I mean, the genre is really overblown and generic, but this band is good at what they do, and there's no denying that. This CD is chock-full of energetic songs and power ballads, and the title-track is one of the best songs the band, and hell, the genre's ever produced. The songs kinda sound similar after a while, though, but the great production save most songs songs."
3,some good stuff but nothing special,I love 3 doors down's debut album the better life. It has some great songs like duck and run and kryptonite. Away from from the sun has some goods songs like when i'm gone and running out of days but most of the songs sound flat and without much character to them to make them stand out all that much. Stick with the better life instead of getting away from the sun.
3,"Good music, fair SACD","Not that great as far as SACD's and effects go, but I like the music and stereo sounds excellent."
2,Misinformed,"I purchased this with the understanding that the video ""when I'm gone"", would be on it. This video means a lot as a Iraq vet that deployed around the time that it came out. I have been looking for quite some time and it was not on the bonus DVD that was included , very misleading . I already have the album and had bought this one with expectation of that song on DVD ."
1,A person with common sense,"This cd is by far one of the worst cd ever recorded. This cd shows what is wrong in the world of rock music, bad lyrics and repetitive song formulas. This cd and band is the epitome of trash."
2,Away From the Talent,"Liking ""Kryptonite"" and ""When I'm Gone,"" I thought this album would be a welcome addition to my music collection. Initially, it was. However, when I listened to the whole thing, I kept wondering if my CD player was on repeat since there is essentially one song on this album. It doesn't help that that one song is eerily similar to the music of Hootie and the Blowfish. What begins as a fresh, thought-out album all too quickliy becomes a droning noise that begs to be put out of its misery. I'll stick with Hootie and the Blowfish since they offer a similar sound with the addition of variety."
4,Funny game!,"This game works best in a group. It is fun to play, and difficult to predict. You also have to be creative at times. You find yourself thinking about the most ridiculous of circumstances. I recommend it!"
1,Boring,"Boring as sin, they should have come up with more challenges, what a dissapointment! Can't believe the reviews this thing got, what a waste of money!"
3,This is a gift so we can't evaluate accurately it yet.,"The version for youunger kids was well liked, so believe this one will be also."
1,...play a different game!,My friends and I love game nights. We got this WOULD YOU RATHER...? to play last night. We got through 4 turns and we all hated it. We spent more time learning the rules than playing it. We wound up playing TRUTH BE TOLD for a few hours and having a great night. Don't waste your money on this one. Sorry.
4,fun,My kids(13&14 year old boys) played with 4 of their friends(girls and boys) and had a lot of fun. I think the key is having a lot of people play.
1,Very Disappointed,"I placed this order on July 25th, Amazon's estimated delivery date is Aug 18th-25th. I contacted BabyAge, and my order wont be sent until the 6th of Sept. Very disappointed!"
5,Smoothness,"Patrice Rushen is a genious and this album Straight From The Heart is a must have classic. Of course the unforgettable Forget Me Nots is here but it seems as every song is unforgettable. From All We Need to the magnificent Remind Me to the incredible Where There Is Love, Patrice Rushen keeps the jams comin. And if you REALLY want to jam just put on that Number One, a very great instrumental that keeps you movin. Patrice Rushen was one of the greats that got lost in the shuffle even though her songs are easily recognizable. I'd advise anybody who loves great music to go get this album ASAP! You won't be disappointed trust me! Masterpiece"
4,very good!,"blurb off my copy: The Menace of Madness-- Beautiful heiress Romy Becker was recovering from a disastrous romance when Jay Marriott walked into her life. Enchanted though she was by this handsome mysterious artist, Romy was sure that Jay was just another fortune hunter. Yet, she had become Mrs. Marriott and soon started to experience memory problems, people claiming to have seen her in places she couldn't remember being, and a near-fatal accident."
1,DO NOT BUY FOR MAC OS X,"The PC 5220 card worked great on Mac OS X until 10.4.3. At 10.4.3, the card works about 30 to 45 minutes and then crashes the Mac with a kernel panic. Verizon now only sells the Kyocera KPC 650 as Mac supported. Get that one.mz"
1,Terrible,The wireless router was dead on arrival and the wireless card broke 2 months later. Don't buy this product!I replaced it with and Apple Aiport Extreme base station (it works on PC's too!)
1,author has no vision,"Just writing a book doesn't make a faulty argument more legitimate. The author has no vision or sense of community.With populations (especially here in the Bay Area in California) expected to grow exponentially in the near future, and few new lanes to be added, how can the author solve the gridlock that is already aqmong the nations worst? Do the agricultural lands deserve to be suburbanized? Will people be looking for alternatives to driving when gas hits $5 or even $10 a gallon? Is there such a thing as ""community?"" Is there a reason so many Americans are obese and depressed?Skip the book. Save up for a bicycle."
3,It works okay,"I haven't noticed any outstanding effects, but it is hard to notice any sort of mental clarity/calmness as it happens over time. I haven't suffered any negative effects from this, so that is a plus. This sort of thing may take a while to work. I would probably recommend trying this before trying prescription drugs, however."
3,Low-Budget Slasher film,"Well, the movie was kind of cheesy, but it did keep my friends and I interested the whole way through. It's more of a comedy than a horror film. The acting and dialouge are funny due to how bad they are. The front cover of the DVD is completely misleading, there are no traps that people have to get through on each floor. Watch for a silly, good time with your buds along with some take out :)"
3,"Shameless watered-down version of SAW, but...","I actually kinda sorta liked this one.Of course STEEL TRAP is no new classic or anything.It's SAW, without the gore and shoddy directing.It makes a bit of a mockerywith statements likeI want to play a game...orYour mission, if you choose to accept it...It's a slasher/scavenger hunt for teens(and immature adults who love horror).A group of party-goers receive text message invites to an after-hours party. Not being the most pragmatic of folks, these idiots stroll on down to an abandoned floor in the building. Let the games begin...They have to solve stupid puzzles, decipher riddles, etc...The characters are all pretty annoying.There is sex talk with no sex.Sarcasm without any intellect.Plus a lame killer as menacing looking as an S&M; version of Pee Wee Herman.FINAL GRADE--2.5 STARSA step down for Dimension Extreme.A step up from most After Dark Horror Fest.Better than the latest cruddy SAW sequels it's imitating too."
5,Excellent,"Completely surprised at how good this was. Plot was really good and I never guessed who the killer was. For a low budget movie, it was good."
3,TRAPEZOID,Yet another SAW clone that fails in its own excesses. 7 people trapped in an abandoned highrise meet grisly deaths by an unknown masked killer. There is some inventiveness in the methodology of the killings but the pace is rather leaden and the characters totally unlikeable. The acting is mediocre to be kind and the resolution while unpredictable is hard to swallow. Not a total loss but not great either.
3,Not too bad,It was kind of scarey and kind of funny at the same time. I have watched worse. The ending is interesting.
3,Not what I expected,"Music on this CD is great but not what I wanted, More Folk song than Instrumental, but still great music"
3,Nothing Great,"I tried and tried to get into this book, but despite my efforts I gave up. Just too many uninteresting facts for me, as well as the author saying the same thing 5 different ways (almost like filler)."
2,Egg on the face,"Shame... Shame...A self confessed Ogilvy fan has finally found out that this Scotsman can be egotistic as hell!Ogilvy on Advertising was indeed a great book but this book... would take you to a completing different direction. The book was simply a self-satisfying, trumpet blowing bio and Ogilvy would just not let it go. The book was also like the man was trying to kiss his own rear-end.But... Ogilvy is known to be a proud man and you can't blame him. The man built one of the most famous ad-houses and wrote two great bibles (Confession... & Ogilvy on Advertising)!So, what do I think of this book? I think the book was written during the time when Ogilvy regret his baby is with WPP (I may be wrong as the book may have been written prior to that event) and the book's sole purpose was to reinforce his achievement to the world.Read it if you have the time but make sure you got it from the local library."
1,Advertised but not available,"I ordered it, waited weeks and then was sent a message, sorry not available.I can't comment on the item itself as it was probably as wonderful as the pictures looked, so my comments are only about something being advertised that could not be delivered."
5,Best cookbook purchase I've ever made,"This is by far my favorite cookbook. I am actually not much of a cook (though I have lots of cookbooks-go figure!) but I use this one all the time. I've made about a dozen of the soups and I've loved them all. The recipes are easy, delicious and simple to follow."
2,Ok but the title is misleading,"This is basically like all the Gooseberry Patch books. The recipes are fine but it wasn't what I was looking for at all. The title makes it sound like the recipes focus on cooking from scratch but instead you have a lot of recipes that call for premade ingredients. The ""Fabulous French Bread"" recipe starts with a loaf of French Bread. That is not scratch cooking. If you want a really lovely church supper style cookbook, this one is fine. If you are wanting to cook without canned soup, canned beans, processed cheese spread, and a loaf of french bread from the store, keep looking."
5,A Mom's Review,"I'm a read-aloud mom with a family of boys. We span a wide variety of interests in our family, and the ages range all the way down to kindergarten. This is a great book to read out loud, where the dialog can be spoken and the story can unfold. Really good for bringing out the courage and self-discipline of boys. This is very short, though -- hardly a week's worth of nightly reading, and they want more when it's over.This is a 1949 Newbery award-winner. Still a great read.Parent notes: Main theme of overcoming adversity and finding strength in your weakness. Reliance on prayer. The good King Edward in this book is the very same Edward Longshanks who was the villain of the ""Braveheart"" movie. I thought that was interesting."
5,a wonderful book,I had to read thhis book this summer as a millville g.t. assinment. i loved it. at first i thought o great a book thats called the door in the wall. but by the time i was finish i thought don't judge a book by it's cover.
2,The Door in the Wall,"This story was about a boy named Robin who could not move his legs at all. His mom went to go see the Queen and his father was fighting the Scots in the North. While they were gone he stayed with a lady named Dame Ellen. One day she left and did not come back so a monk took him to a hospice. He wrote a letter to his father to meet him at Castle Lindsey. They met each other and soon his mom came home, by then it was Christmas time. They lived happily ever after.I would give this book 2 stars because it did not hold my attenttion at all.I did not like this book at all it did not hold my attention."
1,*Falls Asleep*,"I'm a very big reader and so I can tell what is and what's not a good book. Right now, all I can tell you is that I found the book very...wearisome! No offense to all of you guys that like it, but I had to read this with my class and I literally fell asleep! I'm not saying Marguerite de Angeli is not a good writer, because this is the first book I've read of hers, but I'm just telling you guys that there's absolutely no action! (in my opinion, that is). But hey, that's my point of view. Read if for yourself."
1,Not Worth the money,"Don't let the cover of this CD fool you, in my opinion usingJohn Wayne and Ricky Nelson on the Cover is a ploy by Bear Family Records of Germany to get the lovers of Great WesternMusic to buy it. I am a western re-enactor and use ""good"" western music for backround. I own many CD's that I bought fromAmazon, My Rifle Pony and Me, The Alamo, Rio Grande, Way Out West,and The Wild West just to name a few. Rio Brovo is got tobe the worst. The first selection with Dean Martin, My Rifle, My Pony and me is the Studio Version, not the duet with Rick Nelson, it is good, but it is not the original we are used to. As far as the rest of the selections, it was a bad choice by the recording company.The high price for the CD was not worth it,It would be a good buy for about $2.98, then you can swap with somebody for a better CD.........W.F.(Bronco Bill)PakinkisTombstone, Arizona"
1,Does not BEND,"I purchased this hand for state board. There is a portion that I will need to place hand in a water bowl and well, the fingers do not bend, therefore it is useless! I really am thinking of returning it!"
1,Not worth it!,"I'm a LONG standing Amazon customer and so pleased with everything I purchase we get. However, I'm very disappointed with the product as well as the company that makes this product. The hand is PINK not ""flesh"" color as shown. The fingers on the hand will not ""bend"" and hold their position. The pink color will NOT be true to the nail polish that you are working on so the shade may change."
2,Too dark for me,"While I love both stars, the content was too dark for me. I watched to the end but took nothing away from it."
1,Boring,"This movie is so boring that I had to fast forward part of it. I like the actress, but not in this movie."
1,"Indulgent, introspective, incomplete","This film is an example of all that I hate in a poorly made foreign film: boring characters who endlessly talk in the existential sphere (""What is copy? What is real?), tightly filmed shots that give little sense of locale-- but which manage to always maintain a constant focus on the female character's breasts--, and a preoccupation on the act of eating.The main characters are very serious, very educated, and very boring.As typical of existential-type films, the female character represents Woman i.e. she who man needs, even if he doesn't know this himself. The man is just an oaf who struggles though life.It's all a bit much.But, if you like seeing a woman's bosom throughout a film, this is for you.If you think the French language makes everything sound deep and enlightened, this is for you.If you enjoy seeing actors speaking directly to the camera, this is for you.This film is a forced and indulgent exercise producing nothing.Thank goodness for 1.5 speed!"
1,FILTERS,HAD TO BUY A CASE OF FILTERS BECAUSE I COULD NOT FIND IN LOCAL STORES! FILTERS KEEP GROUNDS OUT OF COFFEE BUT THE POT I BOUGHT IT FOR IS USELESS AND SHOULD BE BANNED FROM THE USA BECAUSE THE CHINESE SEND US INFERIOR PRODUCTS AND LIKE THE STUPID AMERICANS WE ARE WE BUY THEM! BEWARE!!!
1,These stories about sprites and werewolves will,"Hey all you fantasy creature lovers - have I got a story for you. It's called WEREWOLVES. It is a whole bunch of stories about werewolves fromauthors such as Jane Yolen & Ru Emerson.There are some heart touching stories, scary stories and sad stories. The book has other fairy tale creatures such as fairies and sprites (and not sprite like the soda). Sprites are kind of like fairies although they're as big as humans. There are also stories about gypsies that are werewolves.I do not recommend this book to little kids because it can sometimes be a little scary. I do recommend it to people who like fantasy creatures."
5,I had flashbacks of PNG,I grew up in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and was feeling a little homesick. I took a chance and bought this book and I was not disappointed. Kira Salak really made me fall in love with PNG all over again. I will definitely read another of her books.
5,So good. But of course. Its Youth Brigade.,"Sean Sterns voice is one of my favorites, lyrics are great, music is great. This album is close to if not perfect. Yep I said it, perfect. I am in love with this band, always have always will."
4,Hostels Austria & Switzerland,"This guide is well organized and very informative, with information such as price, safety, noise and available facilities of each hostel. It is an excellent guide for first time hostellers, as well as experienced travellers."
4,Unique design and fast delivery,"This was the only Corelle dinner set without a border-only design. Also, one of the few sets which comes with glasses. Hence, the premium to other Corelle dinner sets is probably justified. Good for daily use.The set arrived on the third day, and with all plates, bowls and glasses intact."
2,Broken Items,The response and delivery were excellent. But when the package arrived the Corelle box was inside a larger box and there was not enough packing material around the Corelle box to stop it from moving inside the box and there was no packing materian on the top or bottom of the Corelle box. When we opened the item we found broken plates. Amazon's response was very quick and professional. We will use Amazon again dispite this packaging problem.
5,we can do whatever we put our minds to,"love learning new things. its true , we can do & be anything we put pur minds to. i appreciate anyone with the skills to put into writing just how easy it really is to do, if your openminded enough & willing to try new things. thank you"
4,Great Product,The Transcend 1GB 45X CompactFlash Memory Card has done wonderful for me and it does not have a high price as so many of the other CompactFlash cards carry. I would certainly recommend this product.
4,Great African Plays,"This book was required for class, but I would not think of selling it back as I've enjoyed these plays so much."
3,Very Dissappointed,"I am a huge El-p fan, I think he is a genius, but man this album just seems like something he threw together in 5 minutes. Maybe i was mistaken, but i thought this was going to be a kick ass rap album like Fantastic Damage. Instead, it is a bunch of instrumental stuff and just ...actually now that i think about it, its a buncha junk. Sounds like something he whipped together real fast for a quick buck. Constellation Remix is the only good song, its the only one with lyrics, except for Oxycotin, which El-p describes as weird in the inner sleeve. No, its not weird it sucks. I was soo psyched for this album and when i heard it I wanted to vomit all over myself. So in conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this album, El-p you are still a amazing, but man I'm very dissappointed in you. Buy Fantastic Damage instead."
1,Definitely not for little kids,"This book may be just right as a humorous gift for an adult pal who has recently broken up with a significant other, or for older kids who might think it funny, but I think it is both disturbing and inappropriate as a book for small children. Starts off great, but I really wasn't interested in starting a discussion about 'if she was going to forgive him, why'd he eat her, mommy?'."
3,Good product.,Fit was great. Finish is great. But the inside of the mirror shakes anytime driving over 40 miles an hour.
3,In Concert and in the Studio,"Made in HOL in 2000, Serial# EXCEL-206, Playing Time 87:54This 2-disc set is made up of live material on disc 1, recorded in their early days at an unknown location: based on the track listing, I thought it would be the countlessly released Toronto Rock & Roll Revival from 1969, but it isn't; it isn't from ""Carnegie Hall"" or ""Live In Japan"" either, so I'm a bit puzzled as to its source(s).Disc 2 contains all tracks from ""Chicago VI"", but with a shuffled running order.The album is packaged in a nice slipcase, but the double-jewel case contains no booklet, so no liner notes or credits.If you're considering buying Chicago 6 (""Feelin' Stronger Every Day"" IS a classic!), you might as well get this for the extra live disc."
2,Non traditional music,"Most of this musich is a non traditional Michele Branch CD. I ordered it for my wife and she did not like it at all. I am a drummer and the more I listen to it the more I like it, but that is not why i ordered it."
1,You can do better than that,"The Hossam Ramzy track #1 is very good. The rest are like pop versions of belly dance music, smiley-face versions; some are almost the type of song you expect to find on a childrens educational program. One cut even had happy hand clapping.I am not a belly dancer, I was looking for music evocative of that genre, and this is not it."
2,it was ok,"I guess, i was looking for more of a dance club/ with a middleastern flavor..and a lot of the music started to sound the same..."
1,Disappointed in the book,"While ordering the turkey fryer, I was prompted to read the reviews of the 103 uses book. I was really excited to get the book based on the reviews I read, but very disappointed when it arrived. Other than a mention of using the fryer for canning and one recipe for making beer, it was basically a book with fried recipes. Fried chicken, fried fish, french fries, jalepeno poppers, etc. There was nothing special about the recipes, and it certainly was not worth the $10. I'm sure you could get all of the recipes online for free."
4,great gift,"I bought this book for my dad for his birthday, which falls right after Christmas. I first searched Border's for it and they didn't have it. When I searched for it on their computer, a used copy was for sale for $54! It's a paperback book! When I searched Amazon...there it was. My dad frequently goes to camp with his buddies and uses his turkey fryer often. Now he can use it 102 other ways!"
3,Lots of possibilities!,"We fry a turkey every year and it is wonderful. Less time in the kitchen is enough reason to own a turkey fryer but this book gives 102 other possibilities. The only other thing we'd ever used it for was toting our six month old in dressed as a lobster for Halloween. This Christmas my husband fried a prime rib. He said it tasted oily but the rest of us liked it and considered it a break from our usual holiday fare. Other recipes we've considered trying include Apple BBQ Sauce and Naturally dyed Easter Eggs. Maybe the brew your own beer too. But it seems hard to imagine busting out the turkey fryer to try something it is so easy to buy--sauce, egg dye, beer. Of course there are 98 other recipes, those are just the ones I recall."
4,Only difference is that you get a case,"If you are going to buy a Olympus Camedia D-370 Digital Camera Value Package, only bonus is the case nothing fancy apart from that but the camera wonderful, i highy recommend you buy a32Mb smart media card with which i took about 137 pics."
1,Olympus D 370 camera,"Weighs a lot for a digital camera, and not very high powered - was a gift - I, myself, intensely dislike Olympus and the customer service they do NOT provide their customers. Had a VERY bad experience with an Olympus camera that had blurry pics and came out with spots on the pics - Olympus would do NOTHING to fix or replace the camera - POOR customer service!"
5,Awesome Camera,"This camera is great. I have taken 5 mini-movies (60 seconds each), over 35 photos and the batteries still show as full capacity. The quality of photos can't be beat in this price range."
2,Didn't meet expectations.,"I was looking forward to rather substantial noodles (as advertized, home-style noodles), but these are very thin. When they are cooked they have a tendency to glob together because they are not more substantial. They did not meet my expectations."
4,Fast delivery,"I purchased this for my Sister for Christmas, it's what she wanted, and it arrived quickly and in great shape, no damages. I'm sure my sister will love it."
5,NEVER ACTUALLY RECIEVED THE PRODUCT,I AM VERY UPSET WITH THE SELLER ON YOUR SITE... I NEVER ACTUALLY HAVE EVER RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT... PLEASE DEACTIVATE THEIR ACCOUNT. THEY TAKE MONEY BUT DO NOT RESPOND NOR DELIVER
2,A book for complete morons,"If you are the kind of cyclist who needs to be told to avoid patches of loose gravel, this book's for you! Of course, if you are that stupid, you shouldn't be allowed on a bicycle at all, and people probably should make a serious effort to keep sharp tools and implements away from you, also.The astonishing thing about this book is not simply that it's written for complete morons, but that the author really doesn't talk down to the reader. He's on the same level. A scary thought, no?"
5,"Finally, some real rock worth talking about.","This band has truly come from out of nowhere showing what real musicians are made of. The guitar riffs are catchy, crunchy and oh so sweet old school. The drums are fat and pounding, all while the laid back vocals kind of suck you in to this great band's energy. Please give them a listen. I really believe that there aren't many other albums out that can compete. To sum it up...if you like music, give this one a shot, you won't regret it."
5,THEY ROCK!,"The songs have really good lyrics,and this band ROCKS. Most CDs might have one or two songs that are good. This CD,all the songs are great. I've got to see the band play live,they are even better,something you don't see often."
3,Good But Not Great,"It is pleasant to see a rock n roll band emerge from so much crap in the mainstream. These guys follow in the footsteps of good classic rock like Lynyrd Skynyrd. There are some standout tracks on the album such as ""Walk On"" and ""Buffalo Creek"" but as a whole the album falls a little flat. Most of the songs are filler and tuneless. If you like good rock n roll it's worth checking out but don't expect to love every song on the cd!!!"
3,More entertaining than instructive,"I found the strong point of this book to be that it contained a lot of interesting tactics and swindles. Not so much on opening traps and the tactics and swindles are no really arranged in what I would call a learning order. This book is more to entertain, and as long as that is known then there is nothing wrong with it. ""Winning Chess Traps"" covers opening traps if that is what you are looking for. The opening tactics are better in that book. But, if you want a good variety of tactics and especially the swindles (that makes this book unique) then this is what you are looking for."
2,Lack of vision,"There is a lack of vision in this book as to what it wants to achieve. For a ""101"" book I was expecting to have a systematic approach to diagnosing and tuning system performance. Instead it wastes a lot of time on very general statements such as ""choose the right balance"", ""find the bottleneck and then tune it"" etc. I would expect that such things are obvious in fixing any problem.i.e. you understand the nature of the problems and then fix them.There is a start along the direction of using a systematic approach but the author doesn't follow through."
2,Not Designed for Advanced Pilates,"While the book's layout is visually helpful, I was hoping to see advanced mat work, and it's not here to be found. For instance, The Corkscrew and Straight Leg Stretch were shown with ""external rotation,"" but no real elaboration or emphasis on this technique. Also, it would have been good to see an advanced (hands to ankles or feet) pose for the Open Leg Rocker. I am looking for a book with more advanced techniques employed."
3,Power Pilates!,"As a beginning Pilates gal, this book was excellent in helping me begin my adventures! The pictures demonstrated exactly what each exercise looked like for those times when I was lost and confused!"
2,Nice book but what's all the hype?,I bought this book because it's clearly photographed and clearly written but I cannot say it is the absolute best book out there. I have read through many of these reviews and am frankly confused by the cult-like following the author seems to have gained. After a second trip to the book store I found several books that seemed far more comprehensive than this book - not to mention visually inspiring. There are some beautiful hard-cover full color books with wonderful instruction. All in all Siler's book is fine but I would have to say that it's pretty much yesterday's news. Since this book came out a few years ago there have many books written that far surpass it. Just goes to show you what good marketing can do.
4,Good information,This book is great for those who want to learn all of the manuevers. It's almost like a giant pilates glossary. The 4 star review is for the fact that it's impracticial to try & do Pilates and read the book at the some time. A supplement tape would help.
3,Beloved Bible Stories,"This series of bible stories will be available from Thomas Nelson Publishing in June. There will be four volumes in the series. Comprised of thirteen stories in Vol.1, this delightful DVD is geared toward introducing youngsters to the wonders of the bible. Each story is but three minutes long so as to not lose a child's attention. Told in a clear, simple manner with animated characters, these stories are entertaining and educational.The use of bright colors, soft musical background and many animals throughout the presentation is sure to capture the hearts and minds of very young children.At the end of the DVD is a short clip showing kids watching the DVD and then they tell what their favorite part is. I found this little clip interesting as most of the children gravitated towards Noah's ark or the stories of Jesus. A wonderful addition to any family's library.The author is listed as Gwen Ellis and the illustrator is Steve Smallman."
3,Shemp paled in comparison,"Ever since I was a kid, I've groaned when a Stooges film came on and saw it was a Shemp episode. Shemp was a poor substitute for Curly, the funniest and most talented Stooge. To quote an episode of the old TV series Barney Miller, in which one character says ""I liked Shemp,"" the other, a Curly fan, simply replies ""We have nothing firther to discuss."" My sentiments exactly."
2,"Not the worst UFC ever made, yet three stars below excellent","UFC 10 featured a good deal of fighters grappling and fighting each other while they were on the ground. It is not, in my opinion, too much different than the other UFC's that I've seen so far, such as UFC 4: Revenge of the Warriors.If you want to view a UFC tournament that contains a great deal of action, buy UFC 6: Clash of the Titans."
1,Terrible...,"When Uptown Girls came out in theaters, I was dragged to see it by two of my friends. I literally fell asleep during this movie (and don't say, ""Oh, you fell asleep 'cause you saw a late show,"" because we saw a one-in-the-afternoon show). I, personally, think Uptown Girls is one of the worst movies ever. And the spinning--Oh, the spinning! What was up with that??This is basically a movie about a rich woman (Brittany Murphy) who is forced to find a job when an accountant takes her money away. She ends up being the nanny for a girl (Dakota Fanning) who hasn't got an ounce of kid in her. Blah, blah, blah, yadda, yadda, yadda... If I remember correctly, the movie ends with the kid doing a ballet recital with her nanny's dad's old guitars (which the nanny had to sell to make some money). So, yeah...I hated this movie and do not recommend it to anyone. This is one movie I would not even wish on my worst enemy..."
4,Are you on Crack?,"How cute is this Kid?(Dakota Funning)her career has taken off at such a young age.She acts as if she's 25 years old as spoiled as they come she does a great job(see I am Sam ,Trapped)Brittany Murphy plays her sitter and is a 30 year old spoiled brat herself living off her famous parents that had past away as a chid , her inheritance has ran out, so she ends up sitting for Ray.These two are pleasurable to watch feeding off one another on screen, and they both unfold something special inside they didn't know they had. This is great for your kids and even a grown up will get a tear in there eye .EnjoyP.S Watch out for the pig! cute as a pig can get"
2,Wake me when it's over,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie when it first came out. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. There was a definite lack of a point and plot development, and Murphy's character was not an endearing lead . . . just annoying. Speaking of annoying, the song ""Sheets of Egyptian Cotton"" will forever haunt me. At the end of the movie, my friend and I just looked at each other knowing full well that we had just wasted two hours of our lives that we could never get back."
2,Beatiful Castle but...,"The drawers and chest are difficult to open and close because the pieces get stuck in the open spaces behind chest and in front of the secret drawer. The stands, used to hold the dolls and snap into the dance floor that spins. have two small plastic pieces that snap into the dance floor. The small clips are very easy for a 3-5 year old to break; my 23 year old broke one."
2,A White-Persons View of History,"A fine example of history seen through the eyes of white privelege and culture. A non-stop explanation of ""wonderful"" frontiersmen who were able to ""conquer"" the west for us all to enjoy. The few references to native peoples or non-American early sttles are nothing more than brief footnotes to a glorious re-telling of the ""true heros"" of the Summit area."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I am the last person who'd buy and devour a kungfu book! I bought it for my husband who needed some reading for an upcoming trip. But, desperate for something to read one day, I thought I'd suffer the first chapter. I could barely put it down! I found myself wondering how a particular story would end on those days when my 14 month old wasn't allowing any mommy-reading time. Don't get me wrong: it is definately more for the macho reader! Polly's humor and his description of Chinese personality makes up for the ""guy stuff."" Other than making me think a little about how different cultures are, (I am a rather nationalistic American afterall), it was simply a fun read."
3,Many people are overrating,"As a storyteller, Polly is fabulous, and I learned many interesting differences between the Chinese and American cultures. I'm not that much into kung-fu fighting, but learning about the evolution of kung-fu alongside the development of China during the past few centuries was worth the read. As a warning, the book is long, and I found it a bit difficult to get through 350 pages of someone talking about himself. Females might find this book difficult to get into, for the culture is mostly male, and women are little more than objects of sexual desire. Another downfall is that the time Polly was in China was 15 years ago, and so much has changed. Nonetheless, I'd recommend it as a entertaining way to learn something about China's past, but don't feel bad if you skim."
5,Great Read,"I really enjoyed this book. Not onlydid I learn about the culture of Chinaand Shaolin, but it was a grippingfunny book. Truly a gifted author.I wish he would write more."
2,NOT a martial arts book,"More of a travelogue so if you're expecting lots of deep martial arts writing, stick with Dave Lowry. The author writes well and makes a good story. He also manages to get his negative political digs in at U.S. foreign policy and American culture, not surprising considering he writes for Slate. Kind of backfires on him though because reading this book just reinforces how advanced we are compared to China (more than 50 years). A good book if you want to read about modern China. Also a good book to burst your bubble about Chinese martial arts. As an asise I couldn't help wondering how a Shaolin monk would do in the UFC. Not very well I suspect."
2,Very lazy,"This is an incredibly lazy print. It is obviously a scan of a more typical poster size and shrunk down to fit within 11x17. Note I said within, the product has a significant white border around what you are actually paying for.As the image shows, it is a scan from a folded poster, which I knew getting into it. But beware if that would bother you.My recommendation is that if you really want this then put it in a frame so it just looks like it is matted. I got this at such a cheap price that it's not really worth the effort to cut it down properly, at least not at the moment. It is worth the extra money to get a better print at a more appropriate size."
2,Not my favorite college essay book,"Some people swear by this book, but I didn't find it that helpful. The book has some examples at the end, but the commentary does not provide much insight as to how the reader can fix their own essay. The writer uses quotes from different college counselors, one of which I found out is from a counselor at my school! What I most disliked about the book is that it gives more examples of college questions, than ways to approach the question. In one chapter, the author gave 3 pages worth of college supplement section questions but didn't give a clear way to answer them.I would recommended looking into other books before you buy this. Visit your local book store and flip through the book before deciding to buy it. I found another book I bought (The 50 Successful Harvard Application Essays) much better than this. It doesn't surprise me though, because it is branded by the College Board, which makes me expect vague explanations and no real purpose."
5,Excellent aid to prospective college students,"Ms McGinty's advice on crafting a noteworthy college application essay is a wonderful aid to an aspiring college student. She provides numerous examples of essays but, more importantly, clearly outlines how to approach the process so the finished product actually reflects the person who is writing it. The point is not to imitate someone else's impressive essay but rather to utilize the advice in this book to speak with your own voice while remaining aware of what colleges are looking for - that is, to think about the process in addition to making use of practical suggestions. I think this book is an invaluable guide to a challenging, even intimidating, undertaking."
5,For students and parents,"I had seen the former edition. What struck me on reading the new edition is that the author is clearly writing both for students and parents. Both, of course, have a tremendour investment in the process, and the process can go easier for each if they focus on the author's suggestions. Dr. McGinty's in depth experience in coaching essay writers is brought to life in this book."
3,A quick and enjoyable read.,"Some reviewers get awfully critical--if you're looking for the Great American Golf Book, this isn't it--but it is an entertaining little story that, if you love golf and follow the PGA tour, you'll enjoy. There are no startling revelations here, but it does give you a glimpse of what it's like on tour. I recommend it when you want a quick and easy golf story."
3,Decent,Picked up this film because I am a fan of Michael Shannon. Over all the film is a bit dull but for an indie flick it's directed and acted quite well. Just the story was lacking a little.
3,Family feud: first family against second family,Sometimes a feud has biblical proportions.A bad talk at the Dad's funeral leads to a fist fight.Then a dog killing leads to the death of two brothers.A fish farmer and his brothers against the inheritors.It is a rich man poor man story and since they arebrothers it is hard to tell them apart at first.The father sowed and the sons reap in violence.Sort of a slow moving tragedy about how not torun your family life? A coma and shotgunsbrings this one to a close!
1,Didn't compare at all with the rest of her work.,"Having run out of Herald/Companion fantasies to devour, I decided to give the Bards a chance. Maybe this wasn't the best one to start with, I thought it was simple and predictable and altogether fake. There just wasn't any of the magic that makes her other novels enchanting."
2,bad purchase,I chose this phone based on Consumer Reports information and Amazon review.I paid too much for a phone that cannot get too far from its base before reception is nonexistant.
4,Good phone - plenty of features,"I have two complaints. First the copy phone book feature is a bit awkward and not quite what I expected. Additionally, it would have been nice to update the phone book automatically any time a given phone added an entry.Second, though the base package I found everywhere: Sams, Best Buys, etc. etc. the individual expansion phones I could only find on Amazon. Relative to the package deal, the individual phones are priced higher than I thought they should be.Some callers complained about range. Range of operation to me was OK. As an Engineer I somewhat understand your frustration, but range is effected by a lot of factors. If possible you could try relocating your base station."
3,Meh,"While some pretty little episodes on this spicy baby, there is a large sum of good Cartman episodes missing.They'd rather have the AIDs or Ginger episode on this set than Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000 or Cat Orgy.That sentence alone speaks volumes about this set. sad list of episodes they lined up for what could of been a great buy.On the up side of things, and why you'd wanna buy it, if your a collector, its hard to pass on. The packaging is brilliant, and the little things they throw into it is a nice compliment.Then theres also an introduction by THE Eric Cartman himself on the set.Buy it for collector's sake only. Nothing more."
2,The Cult of Cartman,I like all of the Southpark seasons and I have collected them all. This one I thought would have been just about Cartman but never before seen. Instead it was the ones from the seasons in the past. i guess I have just seen them all and was expecting different.
2,Not loving it,"I was so excited to find this Low-Carb Baking Mix and I thought that it would be of the same quality as all the other Bob's Red Mill products I've used. Unfortunately that is not the case. I've used it in several low carb baking recipes and it smells and tastes like FISH. (Or is it soy, as others have mentioned?) I don't know, but this product makes awful baked goods and the unfortunate smell and taste overpowers any other flavoring you may have in the recipe. I imagine it must be a good coating for fish though.I'm sorry I purchased this in bulk as well, as I feel bad about wasting money and food. This is not a keeper."
1,Grossly Understated Carb Count,"Not only does this baking mix contain fructose and turbinado sugar (where is the 'low carb' in those?), it tastes horrible. It is bitter with a very strange texture.The recipes are easy to make, but the results are less than appetizing. It was definitely a mistake on my part to order this on Amazon, since I was only able to purchase in bulk.This is definitely something to avoid if you have Type 1 diabetes. The carbohydrate count is grossly understated and will shoot your blood glucose numbers through the roof."
2,Doesn't fit,"This coat just doesn't stay on my dog. It slides around even though I fasten the velcro straps as snugly as I can. I don't think the velcro will last either. Some of the seams are not properly sewn. It's not worth the money, so I'll return it. Too bad."
4,terrific coat!,"My 18 lb. mini-poodle looks great in it, and now she finally has a coat long enough for her neck- tail length.{17 inches}. It's soft and warm, but indeed --the velcro could be better."
5,well made and warm coat easy on easy off,"The temperature outside has been under freezing for weeks now. Maddie, a 9 lb Maltese wears a sweater inside the house and looks for her coat to go outside. The coat is easy on and easy off right over her sweater, she wears this coat just outside and does well with it even in the snow. Definitely a must for Maddie."
3,sizing issue,"i am waiting for a response from vendor... this is a well made product but is sized big. it was for my pet but is huge, so i tried it on my daughters rottweiler and it was big on him (100# +)...so the sizing is the issue... i am trying to get info on returning this item for a smaller size, haven't heard yet so check sizing before ordering..."
5,Perfect !,Cozy and very easy to put on. Fits my two Maltese perfectly; 5.7 lbs and 5.2 lbs. I recommend it highly.
5,"Great fitting, good looking coat.","I ordered an XL for my very large Ausie. The fit is perfect. There are velcro straps at the collar and belly. It's easy to put on him, keeps him warm and doesn't interfere with his movement. The belly strap is far enough forward so it stays dry when relieving himself. The coat is also very good looking!"
4,Picture for large is wrong!,"I needed a large for my pup, but disliked the picture showing it as different from the other sizes. I bought it anyway. I was very pleasantly surprised to see it was the same as the other sizes! It is a lovely coat and will keep my pup warm on those cold winter walks. I am very pleased.Update:I have a MALE dog, so he needs room under his belly to do his pee. This coat blocks it. Bummer! I'm trying to figure out a way around it, because I love this coat. It stays in place as we walk, where many, if not most, seem to slide to the sideIf anyone else had the problem and came up with a solution, please share! Luckily I sew, so I THINK I can fix it."
5,Excellent book,"I recently bought an electric pressure cooker off of QVC and needed some recipes. I would use my old regular pressure cooker once in awhile, but only to do meats in and nothing fancy. This cookbook explains alot! It really walks you through everything and has variations on the same recipe. I have not made anything yet, but will make something tomorrow. I know it will be easy because you are walked through it all. Now I just wish I had bought 6 qt instead of a 5 qt! I hope the author comes out with another recipe book as I am looking forward to more recipes/"
2,Wish I had looked inside,"The book is okay, the recipes are of things we don't even eat let alone heard of before. The book is not what I was looking for."
4,Very Good Guide,"This is a good guide for new pressure cooker users. It's primarily geared for the old 'rocker-type' stovetop cookers, but I have an electronic PC and so have modified (increased) the cooking times a bit. The recipes are good starting points for your own creativity. I looked at several PC books in the library before choosing to buy this one."
3,"Just ""OK""","Being the cook in my family, I expected a LOT more in this book. Good for a rank beginner, but a little light on content."
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"I'd hoped for a good old-fashion pressure cookery resource, with basic, clear and handy instructions and guidlines on timing & liquid amounts. My guess is that most cooks who use pressure cookers are simply looking for a quicker way to get dinner on the table, adapting their own commonly used recipes. This book is not representative of the 'grandma's kitchen' type of pressure cookery that I was personally looking for.The first 20 and last 20 pages offer a lot of helpful information though (especially for the novice PC cook) including the different types of pressure cookers, where to get them, how to use them, timing charts for meats, grains, beans and rice. For many this may balance what I felt the book was laking - just basic pressure cookery instructions and good old-fashioned recipes."
4,Pressure Cooking,I have made several recipes in the book which were delicious. I recently purchased an electric cooker and find I need to add more liquid to the recipes. I'm looking forward to enjoying more of the recipes.
5,Cookbook for Pressure Cookers,Lots of easy to understand instructions for choosing and using pressure cookers as well as delicious recipes.
4,Great shirt but runs large,"I received the shirt right away. It appeared as in the picture. Good quality. Only problem was that I ordered a Large, which I did receive, but it is much bigger than all my other shirts which are also Large. This is probably more like an extra large. My advice is to order a size smaller than you actually wear."
2,breaks easily,"I bought several of these watches to use with middle school track runners. I was really excited about the price and appearance of the watches. However, I've used them twice and have already had two or three of the watches break. It seems that the pin that holds the metal bracket on the top band (the bracket for fastening the watch around the wrist) comes out of place exceptionally easily. If my kids catch all the parts, it's no big deal to put it back together. But more than likely that small pin will fall to the ground to never be seen again, and now I am creating my own fastening system for the broken watches. I'm really disappointed."
4,Great archaeological find brought to life,"This book will fascinate children who show interest in ancient civilizations. And, because it shows pictures of a naturally mummified body, it might just be interesting to just about any elementary or junior high school child. This book gives a brief but interesting overview of the recent discovery of the Iceman, a 5,000 year old man found frozen in an Alpine glacier. The book tells this remarkable story while teaching the basics of history and archeology. This book is also an enjoyable read for adults."
3,Great book!!!,"We got this from the library for our 2 1/2-year-old daughter and it quickly became her very favorite book and not just at bedtime. Naturally, we could not keep the libraries, so we bought her her very own copy. Great story, great illustrations."
2,would be good BUT has a very annoying glitch,"everything worked fine and was according to expectation except for the mouse wheel.without fail it takes 2-3 clicks before the page starts scrolling and when it finally moves it goes several clicks at a time then pauses, then moves again. also if i change direction on the wheel, the page scrolls 1 click in the direction it was PREVIOUSLY moving then scrolls in the diretion you want it to go.VERY VERY ANNOYING when i think about how i paid how much money for this and i have a perfectly good mouse sitting in my closet. i may have to recommend people to wait for them get the kinks out before picking this up."
2,Still good however...,"Although almost everybody says the good words, I should point out several things which make me very unhappy:1) Hard to set up due to the poor documentations. If you have something wrong with the installation, that is really a pain.2) The left and right mouse buttons are cramed together. I don't know why logigech came up with this design. This is an exception compared with other logitech mice.3) There are no cap and num lock lights on the keyboard. When you boot up the machine and enter the password, got to lose some time.Anyway, I probable go for the Microsoft intelli mouse and keyborad combination."
5,Great product,"I initially wrote a review for this mouse praising the keyboard, but condemning the mouse. Truth is, if you have a mousepad (I strongly dislike mouse pads), the product works great.Overall, the product looks great, and the keyboard works without a hitch. However, the mouse still has an odd quirk - it doesn't register some of the wheel clicks. For example, say you rotate the wheel downward - often the page will not scroll. Then you scroll up, and the page scrolls down and then up again. Given that I haven't read about anyone else having the same problem I will assume that it is my mouse alone that's doing this, and will therefore give the product a rating of 4 stars.UPDATE: Removing MouseWare has fixed my wheel scrolling problem. If you run across a similar problem, try removing MouseWare."
5,This set is amazing.,"I love this keyboard and mouse set. I have never had a problem with bad connection except in the very beginning (the instruction manual does not point out the connect button on the mouse and it is miniscule and I could not find it.) The battery life on the keyboard is amazing. I have not yet changed the batteries and I have had it for 3/4 of a year. The mouse batteries last for about a month. The mouse is very durable. I have dropped it repeatedly and the worse thing that has happened is the batteries have popped out. The extra buttons on the keyboard are great. There are 9 buttons which you can program to open certain applications plus a volume control button, mute, rewind, fast forward, next track, previous track, pause/play, stop, open media player, back, and go. There is also a scroll wheel on the keyboard. The mouse has four buttons and one scroll wheel."
4,Perfect.. But..,"In Fact, my mom like this product i gave it to her in the Mother's day she like it sooo much but as i see it is too small i mean the pendant :sbut it is very cool & Fantastic present for your mom,, i bought it at 99$ because in the same day there was a sale for this item :D :P"
2,Not as pictured,"The description says that these tips are new, and they are shown in a factory package. However, they arrived loose in a small zip lock bag. They didn't look worn, but I ordered them to be included in a Christmas present, so I would have preferred that they arrive as pictured. I was not at all happy."
4,As expected,"I own the previous model, and bought two of the new models for Christmas presents. They work just fine, and the replay is a nice feature.I'd love to have the option of changing the display colour (it is red, my interior panels light up green), but that's just about my only complaint."
4,"Great radio, terrible Sirius signal","The radio is excellent. Sound quality is clear. The problem is Sirius uses constantly orbiting satellites so keeping a steady signal is impossible. You have to keep moving the antenna around as the satellite moves. Reception in a moving car is decent, less signal drops. Listening at home is almost impossible. If you use a microwave oven anywhere in the house, the signal is dropped."
4,Good Little Scope,"I wanted a spotter for my hunting pack and didn't have a lot of money to throw at one of the bigger names. I'm glad I didn't, this scope is exactly what I wanted. There may be better optics out there but not within a couple hundred dollars of this scope."
2,As Is no Warranty,This book contains a lot of useful information in the way of sample code. Unfortunately the sample code has little in the way of step by step explanations. If I wanted to wade through someone elses code figuring it out for myself I would go to the Online archives. This book is absolutely not for the beginner and will make an intermediate think twice about what you've gotten yourself into. There are also many errors in the index which makes looking up information quite difficult as well. In all I would say it's a decent book but it could have been put together a lot better and could have provided readers with better explanations of what was going on in the samples. One section around page 200 has 3 pages of text followed by 29 pages of Code then followed up with 3 more pages of text. I really feel that code imbedded comments are not sufficient when readers are trying to fully understand the programming language.
4,Good Basic Biology Book,"I read part of this while preparing to teach high school biology (and seventh grade life science again) in Christian school. It lacks the many colored photos and diagrams of other books, but this helps it to be a decent portable study guide that I used for summer reading.Lacking the explanatory pictures and diagrams, I doubt this would really teach biology to someone who knew little about it. But it made for a good summer review, and for filling in some of the blanks in my knowledge of a subject that I got some of my college credits in years ago when we didn't know as much.Were it not so expensive (textbooks always are), I'd buy this. I borrowed it from a library last time."
1,Not as advertised.,Product was advertised as 4 24-pk but was in fact 4 4-pk. Item returned over three weeks ago and we're still waiting for our refund.
5,Excellent tool!,"In two lessons, my 4yo got the hang of blending sounds together. In a span of 3 days, my child can now read small words. She had no previous knowledge of reading other than recognizing the full alphabet. Very impressed with the effectiveness of this book."
1,My son was so bored by this - sorry!,"Hi,In a nutshell, if you have a visual learner who likes colour, or one who struggles to blend this book is not for you. My four year old was totally turned off by this so instead, we purchased the online Headsprout programme and now he is a really confident reader in a short time. My advice is to go for a different book but if your budget allows, buy Headsprout because it is brilliant and it works. My son loves reading because of that programme.Hope that helps you.Faye"
4,Great book!,"I ordered this product for my daughter when she was 4 and this is actually an reorder for my son age 3 now. My daughter picked up on all the syllables and sounds when I went over this book with her. It really reinforced things she learned in kindergarten later and helped her to read from the start. Although I think my son is too young to go over 3 pages at a time now but it doesn't hurt to have him look at the book and go over the CD-ROM, so later he may catch on quicker when I go over each lesson in detail. It took my daughter about an year to finish this but I also was not regular with her as I was pregnant with my son at the time. But she remembered all the lessons even though we had to review it a couple of times, as there was too much gap in continuing the Reading Lesson at the time. I recommend a parent to go over the Reading Lesson with their child at their leisurely pace, and create interest in them so that when they are ready they catch on super fast. -Padma Muduli"
5,awesome teaching tool,This book is great. I started doing the lessons with my son when he was 4. He looks foward to the lesson each day and has learned so much. I love the kid friendly format. I highly recommend this book.
2,Romance - Not Historical Fiction,"Firstly, the cover of this book should have a woman with a ripped bodice clinging languidly to a bare-chested man. The language between the sexes is often racy, and the undertones always sexual, that is when they're not discussing the morality of slavery, which brings me to my second point.It is difficult to believe that brutal mistreatment of slaves was so rampant. Of course they all weren't treated as well as those of the O'Hara's and the Wilkes's, but come on...This book was hard going. I must admit I only read 36 chapters, but one would think that by then a plot would have been established and characters would be developed. But the characters were never more than stiff and unnatural.The only things that kept my momentum were the cheap plot tricks, which were always murders.The book's only redeeming aspect was the interesting facts about Charleston's and South Carolina's history. Without this, it may as well have been written by Danielle Steele..."
3,Charleston - difficult to follow,"Being a big fan of John Jakes, I purchased his latest novel in anticipation of getting lost in one of his classic historical tales. While Charleston is an interesting story, I don't feel that it is the same quality as his other work. As always, I appreciated the attention to detail and the unique perspective Jake's characters bring to history. The problem was that I failed to connect with any of them and at times had to look back to remember who they were and their relationships to each other. It felt like the book consisted of separate stories with very little to tie them together. It's a good story, just not up to what I had hoped it to be."
3,3.5 Stars...It was okay,"I love reading books about this time period, because in all honesty, there is a lot to be learned in the period between the Revolutionary War and Civil War about America. This novel was okay but it wasn't what I was expecting, it was the first novel I have ever read by John Jakes, I am planning to read ""North & South"" later this month, because I LOVED that mini-series when I was young. So there are the usual Southern characters, I know because I am Southern. There is the crazy aunt, the crazy cousin, both were deliciously insane; the goody goody, Alex who sincerely, worked my last nerve at points, and it was pretty decent, it was a little choppy but I enjoyed it over all. It would be good beach reading material."
4,The Universe,"If you love space then this is the book for you. The conceps leave you wondering how big the universe is and if it is still expanding. The pictures are absolutly breathtaking. With the pictures and explanations of the galaxy, black holes, and stars, the book is a must for space lovers. It is easy to understand and would make a great gift to any child, or anyone of any age, who loves space."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"This product is exactly what we were looking for, as I had one set and needed another. Spent a day looking all over town and could find none, so came on the internet and found it right away. Thank you so much for having this product available."
1,Get a different book!,"Like the previous review, this book is accompanied by online tutorials that can(should) be downloaded from their website. Well, as with the deathly onslaught of the dot-coms, eHandsOn.com is out of business, so the online tutorials do not exist.Try another book; one that either has a cd included or hasn't bankrupted their bankroll and better yet both."
4,"Slow, but great","I really liked this book, especially the last third of the book. What I didn't like was how long it took to develop. This is a must for anybody who likes mysteries and/or slow developing books."
3,But the title gives it away!,"If only the title was different, I might have been kept more in the dark, like the protagonist. It was still a page turner, though. This guy might do better the next time around if he doesn't telegraph it so much. I certainly enjoyed reading it, but it could have been so much better. Great idea, well researched, highly believable, but fairly predictable."
1,Fair at best.... No... it's poor,I am listening to my albums A-Z. Dicky Betts Instant Live came up after some Allman Brothers Instant Live. The difference in quality is pretty apparent. Betts does sound altered. The album is not a good one. It's not a bad thing to say.
5,A must have,Darlene is very anointed. I really enjoy the entire CD. The record label did not do enough to promote this project. The 3 tracks that are in constant rotation are:2. If There Were No You5. Be With You7. FinallyI am anxiously anticipating her next project.
5,Gourmet Mexican Vanilla,"I rec'd the vanilla very quickly. It's exactly what I needed. I live on an island in the Pacific Northwest, so I rely on Internet orders for my little luxury items. This is perfect. Thank you so much! Caroline"
1,"A big yawn, a total dud.","That Richard Carlson lent his name to the front of this book, prompted me to buy it. I am both annoyed and disappointed. The book might be better titled '200 unimaginative words on several aspects of retirement'.I have had more fun reading annual financial reports. Not an original thought anywhere, it makes a Readers Digest book summary seem like deep research.Happily, the other book I bought the same day was 'How to Retire, Happy, Wild and Free' by Ernie Zelinski. A liberating book, one that may transform your approach to retirement. If I ever meet Ernie I shall count it a special day."
2,It's NOT what you think,"I ordered this bookbag about a week before school started. When i finally got it about 2 weeks later, i was surprised to see that the bookbag i got wasn't what i thought it was. This so called ""bookbag"" couldn't fit 2 books in it. It's more like a handbag. So if that's what your looking for it would be wonderful, but don't get it if you are looking to carry books in it."
2,Not what i expected,The picture clearly shows you a rather large nice looking backpack but when i recieved it today which is in fact two days before school started i realized it was so small! The site doesnt even give you the dimensions if i would have know it was going to be this small i wouldnt have wasted my money.
5,comprehensive and clear,"This is one of the very best books on America's Vietnam experience. Unlike most books on the war it combines historical, cultural, military, and political perspectives.Moss is also clear on how the media reported the war and how myths about media bias have clouded America's understanding of the war."
3,Okay to start with,"The book is, as its title says, about xcode2. It is NOT about Cocoa. If you are familiar with Objective C to begin with this book will teach you the API, and do it fairly painlessly. If you want to choose just one book, make it ""Cocoa Programming for MAC OS X"", by Aaron Hillegass. The Hillegass book is much more useful in actually learning to program in Cocoa. It's also more of a challenge. Hillegass tells you up front ""This is hard. You are notr stupid."" He's right."
2,Cutsey-Poo Doesn't Fit in a Technical Book (Manual),"I haven't begun to read the book yet, having been so put off by the table of contents. I defy to be able to tell what a chapter is about by reading the TOC. For example:Chapter 2: Shopping for Projects at the Builder's EmporiumMake me one of everythingCoo-coo for Cocal Appsetc.Grow up! How does one look at this TOC and find anything?To be fair, the index is reasonable."
4,A Good Place to Start,"This book is pretty good at explaining the Mass simply. For those of you who don't read much, or have a hard time reading, this book is a very good place for you to start learning more about the Mass. The author assumes that you are Catholic, so those readers who are not Catholic should look elsewhere for a book explaining the Mass.I would highly recommend this book to young Catholics (7th to 12th grade) or to those who don't like a book that is heavy in theology.As a further note of what to expect, I provide this quote from the author detailing his intentions:""The main concern of this book is not so much the beauty of some prayer or the meaningfulness of a gesture or the profundity of a rubric but, rather, the significance of those prayers, gestures, and rubrics in relation to the whole Mass.""From the ""Introduction"", p.10"
3,Worth Money,"When compared to the original charger this looks like a cheaper version in terms of looks (plastic). But for the money paid (under 3$ including shipping), its worth buy. Definitely it serves the purpose.Important note: Wire/Cable is very short length (around 1/2 a meter)."
3,"It is a compact camera, but poor picture quality.","Too much noise, especially in indoor photos. But again, I bought it because of its size. It is really compact, you can keep it in your pocket like a cell phone.Battery life is very good. It has good finish and feels solid. I found most of the cameras which is this size has the same problum with picture noise. If you are planing to buy one, go to a shop and try it before you buy. Otherwise you might get disappointed with the picture clarity."
2,Auto feature faulty,After attaching to a Rule panel switch the pump runs full time in the auto mode. It should only run went it senses resistance. Looking at returning pump.
5,Used by our Youth Minister at Church for Choir,"I have had this book for years and loaned it to our youth minister. He found it to be a favoriate with the youth and would like to have several copies. They have used it in preparing performances such as ""The Lord's Prayer"", etc. One of the best and very simple to learn hand language."
3,Really can't say.,Have not read this book entirely. It looks like it was written for younger readers.
4,Great sound,"Pros: Fantastic sound, brass reeds, solid build, good feel to the keys and good breath response.Cons: No flex hose.It's really mystifying as to why Hohner stopped including the flex hose with this model. The Piano 36 being their largest melodica is most likely the one you're going to want to set on a table or on your lap to play with both hands. At this price one shouldn't have to shell out an additional thirty bucks for an accessory that is included with the less expensive models.Otherwise this is a really sweet instrument worthy of the Hohner name."
3,nothing new,I found this to be repetitive information and it is a simple bio compilation about his life. kjg ihbi hi
4,great,"this dude was a great MC. as far as the movie. I was glad to see it, a lot of things I already knew though others dvds but this one was well put together and it had people talking about pun the man as equally as his music and they didn't go over board at all. I say if you a fan of hip-hop and pun get this."
2,Good book - Beware of errors!,"I used this book as a study aid form my GMAT exam. This book is well organized and easy to understand, however the reader should be aware that there are several mistakes that occur in the quantitative section of this book. They range from simplifying fraction errors to improperly stated formulas. These errors create a high level of frustration when studying with this book."
2,"Good, but poorly edited and written","I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, I appreciated the concise and to-the-point style. I found it easier to brush up on my quantitative and verbal skills with this book than with other GMAT books. If you are short on time then this book would be a good choice. However, the sheer volume of errors really bugged the hell out of me. Most of them are stupid editing errors (occurring on virtually every page), but I also found some critical errors with the practice questions. The massive number of mistakes detracted from my ability to study effectively because I was always second-guessing the book. I found this to be an unforgiveable sin for a test prep book and so I only give two stars instead of four."
1,Not for me,"I disliked this book intensely. Finished it only because it was a gift. Way too much like a lesser Harlequin romance, with about as much depth and character. (Not even on par with, say, Laura Kinsale.)(35 werewolves with one female spells doom for any species' reproductive future, pretty much, by the way.)There was just... too much sap for me. Elena whines, is bossed around, angsts about a bit, and then has a bunch of sex, and I can't see why I should care. I don't like and am unable to identify with the heroine -- she's the ultimate paradox, a weak werewolf.The book isn't bad or offensive or anything -- the characters who weren't Elena were at least somewhat engaging, and the prose isn't terrible either -- it just felt bland. Like a waste of time.It hasn't encouraged me to pick up anything else by this author."
5,This book and the series--BUY IT,"I figure you can look at the other reviews to get the plot and all so all I am gonna tell you is to buy every book in the series, especially Bitten, Stolen, and Broken. I love Clay, Elena, and Jeremy; Lucas and Paige (Industrial Magic and Dime Store Magic) and Eve (Haunted) are great too. The characters are great, their relationships are complex, and the plot is interesting. You can always borrow one of the books from your library to see if you like anything about them before buying the others."
1,Sucked,I wish I could get my money and the time I spent reading the first few chapters back! Those first few chapters were not an easy read and I found myself taking frequent breaks just to get away from it. A waste of time.
3,Okay for first novel,"I read this book because I like the werewolf theme. I also wanted to read something from a feminine perspective. I read ""Moon Called"" by P. Briggs and I thought that was okay. This book was an okay read, but not something that I would call a page-turner. It's basically a romance novel interspersed with the werewolf theme. Had it been a werewolf novel, with just a little bit of romance, then I would have liked it more. Personally, I have no problem with lovemaking, but I don't want to read about it for 1 1/2 pages. I saw this book as being a collection of linear events, with very little excitement. There are perilous events, but you can see the outcome far in advance.I do not find the character of Elena that interesting. The book is about her struggle to decide which of two men she loves, and whether or not she wants to be part of the werewolf pack. Not much of a story there. This would make a great movie on the Lifetime network.I do not watch Lifetime."
1,I Really Hated This Book,"I never actually got more than 80 pages through this book on the multiple times I tried to read. It almost made me give up on Kelley Armstrong as a writer (which would have been a real shame, since she's now one of my favorites) but I just hated Elena. I did not care about her and I found her obnoxious and annoying. I much prefer Armstrong's other protagonist and I have never finished a single book in which Elena was the main character."
1,Disagree,"This book had the type of characters I expect to see in a dimestore romance novel and the plot was on that level as well. Elena lies constantly and is so illogical, self absorbed and dumb, I wanted to slap the book (since I couldn't slap her). Instead of realizing (as anyone with a brain would) what a sweet situation she has with her rich, loving, totally accepting, stud-muffin 'family' and lover, she pushes them away to live a complete lie with her bland human boyfriend.... This is a strong, intelligent heroine? I think not. The plot? Contrived, with characters that are supposed to be smart, but act stupid. Sad, because it could have been a good premise for a good book."
3,Not quite up to the hype.,"I bought this book becasue of the rave reviews here at Amazon, and also because I like werewolf stories. I was disappointed. For a werewolf book, it was well written. I think the genre lacks quality writing, and this one stands out. It's a big fish in a little pond.As a book outside the genre, it was uneven. It started out well, but petered out and became boring as it wore on. The ending was anticlimatic. The 2 main characters (no spoilers) were at times obviously walking into dangerous situations and appearing completely idiotic as they did so. I could see it coming, but the wary werewolves couldn't? They seemed to me TSTL and only by unbelievable (literally) circumstances, they did.I gave it three stars because it was an above average werewolf book, and a below average work of fiction."
4,Nice change of pace,"This is very brightly written book that treats us to a slightly less stereotypical look at the wearwolf world. While the main character can get anoying at times (while she whines her way through her angst), she grows up nicely in this book. I really enjoy how Armstrong looked at and used real wolf behavior in her telling of this story; it really added a new dimension to the usually stale werewolf genre."
2,dont bother,"Poor labs, skips vital information and not that well written. I would say this book is at best supporting reading. Skip this and go straight for the Microsoft press book which was 99% right on for the exam and MUCH more practical for the real world."
2,Import and it shows,"Pliers are average workmanship and in my opimion overpriced, even at the discounted price available via Amazon. The wire cutting part of the pliers are coarsly machined so the wire has to be in the sweet spot to be cut, otherwise it doesn't. The crimping part is fine."
3,An adventure set in the world of tankers,"After the disastrous tanker casualty of the Petros Jupiter off the Cornish coast, Trevor Rodin and his wife Karen watch the consequences of the oil spillage from their cottage garden at Balkaer. In a moment of irrational rage, Karen, armed with a flame-thrower, takes their boat and sets off towards the wreck of the Petros Jupiter, determined to set fire to the remaining oil contained inside the tanker in order to avoid further spillage. But what Karen does not suspect is that her action is going to cause a huge explosion which she can't survive.Now Trevor is determined to go on an eye for an eye, life for a life mission, a dangerous hunt for those who put the Petros Jupiter on the rocks, for those responsible for the pollution and Karen's death. Trevor is going to start with Aristides Speridion, the second engineer of the Petros Jupiter, who fled after the disaster on a stolen dinghy and a Breton boat..."
4,I Laughed Out Loud,"Because it's either laugh or cry. This book is funny, yet sad. Anyone who talks this way is truly stupid. You can't blame it on ADD or dyslexia. I know dyslexics who have PhD's and are very articulate - they can't always spell or alphabetize too well, but they CAN organize their thoughts and speak correctly. It's a sad state of affairs for our country."
5,You can find similar stuff on newspaper web sites,"This book contains quotations from George W Bush that can be found in various articles published in Time, Newsweek, New York Times, Washington Post, etc.. If you have a few minutes (ten minutes at most) you can find a very good collection yourself on newspaper archives, and save ten dollars in the process.But still, it's very funny."
3,A good laugh,"It's frightening that this man is even in the white house. It's hard not to laugh though. I'm not convinced he's not tripping the majority of the time. If you liked this book check out THE GEORGE W. BUSH COLORING BOOK which turns a few of the best bushisms into hysterical, laugh out loud illustrations."
4,A cllinical and historical persepective,"I enjoyed the show, there was nothing of the occult in it, just reports from doctors, emergency room techs, surgeons, and of course, patients. It is a fascinating topic, in that, death is not one moment in time, but is a process, which, may under the right circumstances, be either interrupted, delayed, or in some cases, reversed. There are no psychics interviewed, no mediums, no philosophers, just patients and doctors."
4,Lovely doll for a princess,"Our 3+ toddler LOVES Cinderella, so this was under the tree this past Christmas. Though the fancy shoes fell off immediately (I hid them since they pose a choking hazard to our 2 year old) the doll has withstood the tough toddler test of time since December. Press the small button on her back, and the dress will sparkle and light up while playing the song, A DREAM IS A WISH YOUR HEART MAKES"" (quite LOUDLY I must add)! The doll is a beautiful likeness of the beloved Disney princess, but her hair is so stiff it doesn't welcome children to play with it, the dress does not come off, another NO-NO with little ones, and since the wand is a pointy piece of plastic, it went the way of the shoes to avoid a poking and/or choking hazard. Though the box states for ages 3 and up, I'd recommend this one more for 5+ and even more so for the doll collector since the dress is so unique and well made. It comes in a pretty box too. Overall a really nice doll."
3,Easy Read-Cross between Hard Sci-Fi with a dash of Fantasy,"I found this trilogy to be an easy read, although I disliked the authors tendency to do the infamous 'jump around' between chapters (building up a scene and then having the next chapter deal with a another character). I also found the description of the Matrix Worlds in the first book of the trilogy confusing and hard to follow. I never felt I was 'seeing' the worlds, and had trouble understanding what Hansen was seeing at times. Overall, not one of Drake's best books, but still, if you're a fan, not that bad."
4,nothwood is interesting,Good story line. Good main chartacter.enjoyable read that you actually have to think about to follow.good mix of thinking and action
1,Can I have my money back?,"Come on Steven Seagal this type moviehas been made over & overGet back to Detective Moviesthat MADE YOU A STARYour too Good for this ""waste of film"""
2,Why Steven ...... Why ?????????,"Steven Segal is one of my favorite action stars , i loved him in ""Marked For Death "" & "" Hard To Kill "" and all of his old movies , and i really proud of him that he is still acting and to be honest i still buy any new movie that he reales ............ but the last four or five movie including this one are BAD some are very BAD i really disappointed from these movies ..... the acting is bad the story is bad there is no cool martial arts movments that you expect from steven .... but i still have a hope that he will realse a new movie like the old ones ...."
3,Don't eat anything before you watch this film...,Different from most Seagal movies... if you like seeing humans eat other humans. Worth the money I paid for it.
3,"Good DVD, but most of his others movies were much better.","This was a good movie, but it was not his best, could have been more hand to hand contact in it. Is he getting too old??"
2,For older kids only,"I bought this for my 3 year old, who can sit for longer stories than his toddler Bible, however, beware that the information/concepts in this are really geared for much older children (I would say 9 - 11 years). Stories are graphically told (who killed who, God's punishment by killing Aaron's sons, etc.), and our son was much to young for this much information. Also, some very important stories are left out. For example, in Exodus, there is no mention of Moses' receiving the ten commandments from God. It is laid out nicely, and I think would help children learn the books of the Bible in order. Just beware when buying for younger ones. We're putting it away for now until our son is much older."
2,Product suffers from cheap latch and flag,These mailboxes are widely distributed available at lumber yards andhardware stores as well as on line.They are conventional design of galvanized steel and are not hot dipped. They will rust quickly as soon as a scratch appears in the thin zinc coating. The paint bonds poorly to the zinc coating and quickly (one year) comes off in large flakes.The Plastic latch and flag hinge quickly UV degrade become cracked and brittle as they lose their plasticizers. Parts are not readily available and are relatively expensive.In short this is a once durable product that is now so cheapened as to be unsatisfactory. unfortunately there are few alternatives on the market at reasonable prices.
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could.....,"Bought four mailboxes for my rentals, and three of the four mailboxes' hardware was broken within weeks. Got around to trying to order replacements--usually companies do this for FREE and apologize for problem. They were annoyed to have me call to tell them that plastic latches were poorly made, and was directed to website to PURCHASE replacement parts for $15 per set!!!! So, $60 plus shipping to fix four plastic clips. They have a 90 day warranty on their mailboxes!!!! It's a mailbox, they should last a few years, not three months. WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN."
4,Big Solid Box...,"Great product, although slightly different than description/manufacturer. Box arrived slightly dented at corner from being dropped on corner while in box- but was able to ""hammer"" it out to look fine. Installed easily, and should last years... if it's not banged up from snow/ice/rocks... The large size is great for packages, etc. Overall quality product."
3,Nice mailbox if you can use it,"The box is OK, though the bottom is a bit flimsy. The problem is the mounting. I have a round pole and it is impossible to get brackets for this size. Everybody has it for the traditional T-1 size but nothing for this one. Obviously whoever came up with the big mailbox idea didn't think that people might want to put it on their existing pole. For now the box is sitting in my garage till I figure out how can I mount it or decide to send it back. It is pretty frustrating."
5,Well worth your time!,"So short on time that you need to decide on the book right now, then yes, yes, yes!For those of you with an extra minute: This book works on every level. Either read it cover to cover all at once or open it up anywhere and find something immediately useful in a moment. The practical advice is truly helpful, not cutesy mind-tricks that don't really solve long-term problems. The discussions of why we handle the details of our lives the way we do are intelligent and clear. Dru Scott knows how to present a monumental amount of information concisely and palatably. The numerous case histories that help the book come alive are very short and very readable, and are always presented with a purpose. This is one of those books to keep handy on your shelf, ready for whenever you need to look at it again."
2,Does not fit Tactical,"Although it says that it fits a tactical full size 45, it does not because of the raised front sight to see over a suppressor when attached. I had to cut about a 3in. long gap for the USP Tactical 45 to fit. After that the Tactical 45 will fit it, and the holster does have a very good construction. If I do buy another HK I would just buy a blackhawk holster for a full size USP 45. All and all after the modification that I made it works just fine."
3,Cool bag but hard to keep clean.,"This bag doesn't hold up well in tough situations. It became stained very easy and I can't get the stain out. It holds a lot of stuff, I use it for water aerobics class and it is a good bag for that."
3,"Barefoot, if it's summertime","I don't exactly get the barefoot concept. If the author had seen these homes in the wintertime, would he still consider them barefoot homes? Barefoot seems far-fetched and contrived in this book.This book is a nice compilation of casual homes mostly in the country or at the beach. It's similar to other books on getaway homes. Beyond that, I didn't see anything particularly new or inspiring. It almost seems like the author (or Taunton?) was more interested in pushing the barefoot concept than providing new ideas."
5,Wonderful book!,"I had checked this book out from our library and loved it so much that I purchased a copy from Amazon. For anyone who loves and is inspired by a home that is filled with sunshine, that breathes with the breezes that blow through it due to specific design, and who understands that true interior design means building a house that frames the decoration of the outdoors, then this book is for you. You will love the photographs of homes whose designs are rich in character and texture and a certain simplicity. This is a book that will get viewed over and over in my own barefoot house."
3,screenwriting,Decent. Not the most authoritve book on screenwriting but helpful and fun to read. The author has acutally produced a screenplay that has made it to the silver screen~
4,a nice collection of waynes early movies,"if you like wayne then this collection is one of the better ones with films from his early days.nice transfers,check it out"
5,Sypnosis,"Just say ow, say it now. Just say ow, and it's over. Just say ow, say it now Just say ow, and it's over!Some things that are good for you hurt a bit, it's true.So, just saw ow, say it now, just say ow and it's over!Ow!I am 14 and enjoy viewing videos that tell kids that a visit to the doctor is not as bad as they think it will be. This particular one is wonderful for kids who are nervous about checkups. When Ojo is nervous about getting a shot, Bear teaches her the above song, and it was over before Ojo knew it. Buy this video for your child!!"
3,A bit dated...,"A bit dated, but important read about the infiltration of the New Age Clap Trap that invaded the Church of God. Thank the Good Lord that Father found his way out of the maze of untruths, but looking around at all the horrible things that have occurred in the last 50 years and some of the heretical people that are within the Church right now, it is clear that many Religious and Laypeople did not find their way out of the maze and continued to teach these falsehoods and some still do. The Gates of Hell will never prevail... Lord protect your Holy Church and your People from the enemy..."
4,You Will Never Be Alone.,"Did you know that fleas are highly specie-specific (e.g., the fleas that prefer dogs don't like cats or people)? Did you know that the lice found on the bodies of people are completely different from the lice inhabiting the head or pubic region (a.k.a. crabs)? Do you care?Well, I do. This is a captivating book about the many little creatures which make us their home. From the little mites that eat dead skin cells to the various flora and fauna which reside in the digestive system, this book covers the lifeforms, good and bad, which have evolved with us just as we have evolved with them. As the old saying goes, we can't live without them and we can't live with them."
5,Great stove hood.,"This is a great stove hood, very quiet, easy to install and a nice update to a kitchen. The price on Amazon was lower than any big box store for this quality."
2,"Pretty Pictures, Piddling Information","I bought this book for full price ($24.95) at a Waldenbooks store when I was pressed for time. Not a good idea; and in this case, an expensive mistake. I do agree with the gentleman from Winnemucca, NV, who said that the book has high quality graphics and looks very good. (That's why I bought it without doing any research -- or even looking through it very carefully!)However, virtually all of the information in the book can be found faster and more completely documented by using the Mac Help menu on your Tiger equipped Mac. And the book doesn't even tell you how to install new software or make a copy of a CD or DVD.In summary, this book might be helpful to a person who has never used a computer--any computer--before, but it is of no value at all to anyone else. If you feel you must have it despite what I've said, definitely buy it here rather than pay full retail for it as I did. At least that way you won't waste as much money."
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"I was very disappointed with the quality of this shuttlecock. It breaks after 1 or 2 shots and we consumed entire box for just one game. The quality is very very poor. One advice, just save your money and stay away from this brand."
2,Worked the first 2 days,"This worked great,the first 2 days,after that forget it.I paid too much for the results I got!I have 3 kittens,they all scattered the first day,I sprayed it on my sofa and chair.{I used it on the furniture each morning)The 3rd day,I caught them scratching the furniture as soon as the spray dried!I re-sprayed again,they sat right there and watched me!This time I sprayed so much,even my eyes were affected!The furniture was saturated!After 1 1/2hrs passed,the kittens were right back to scratching!I found a rolled newspaper slapped on my palm and a sharp ""No!"" is working better.I gave it a 2 star,only because it worked for 2 days.That is hardly enough to recommend this product.Maybe,if you had 1 kitten that was sensitive to the spray.Not mine!"
4,Works pretty well for me!,"Prior to using Boundary Spray, I'd come home from work to find my couch becoming more and more destroyed by the day, amongst other furniture items. I bought a scratching post, but the cats just don't seem to want to use it. Since I've bought the Boundary spray, so far so good. Not only does it deter them from scratching the furniture on which the spray is used, it also deters the cats from even approaching the area, like a ""cat repellent."" The smell is rather strong, but if you use it concentrated areas, the spell will fade quickly. The spray needs to be applied daily, or it wont be effective. So far so good. Keeping my fingers crossed!"
5,Princen Presents Powerful Argument Challenging Status Quo,"Thomas Princen presents a unique view on sustainability, introducing and developing the concept of sufficiency while using a creative and original style of writing."
1,Global Warming- Earth gets revenge via Native Amercian Spirits,"What can I say? This is a good story corrupted by some environmentalidiot who wants you to beleive the Earth is killing humans for burning oil. And be sure to forget the fact that oil is one of the most efficient fuels on Earth (none was used in the filming of this movie). Don't waste your time.....this movie spends too much effort trying to convince you we are all evil for using oil-created electricity to watch this movie in the first place. If you want to, throw the main breaker on your house and head off into the woods to die. According to this freakshow, that is what the Spirit of Mother Earth wants."
1,Holy cow was this bad....,"The scariest thing about this ""film"" is the fact that someone OK'd the spending of hundreds of thousands (Millions?) of dollars on producing this stinking pile of dung...Wooden acting, terrible disjointed story, boring ""action"" sequences, no resolution, no connection between events...Could not give it a worse review...Ooooo--a stiff breeze, a couple of crows and phantom caribou!! Wow!!! I'm terrified!! Even if it was not marketed as a thriller/horror film it still fails on levels hard to comprehend as it bores the audience to tears...One of the...No, THE worst film I have seen in a LOOOOOOOONG time..."
3,Can you do better than blood?,"Better Than BloodMegan McCauley's debut album ""Better Than Blood"" has a bit of a split personality, which may leave the casual listener confused as to what sort of artist she is. Part glam rock, part goth, and part edgy pop, ""Better Than Blood"" represents several years of singing and songwriting, as McCauley has attempted to find her place on the radio and in the hearts of fans. The album is worthy debut, with rockers like ""Wrong Way Out"", party-ready tunes like ""Tap That"", and soft, vocally carried tracks such as ""Porcelain Doll"". Yet, something is still lacking. Perhaps a little more time and a little more focus will produce something better than ""Better Than Blood""."
4,"Simple toy, but my son loved it","I bought this for my 7 year old son. I must admit that I worried that he might consider it too ""babyish,"" but the opposite proved true. He took to Ox like his long lost friend. They quickly became inseparable, my son carrying him around by one ear and playing hot potato with him at every opportunity. I don't think the attraction will last for long... kids are like that, but it was a present that he appreciated. Overall, the Ugly Doll toys seem to have hit a good niche of being strange little stuffed animals that kids find interesting."
5,"Cute, cuddly, and an instant favorite!","My son loves all the Ugly Dolls, but Mynus became a favorite fast! I think it's the bright colors and somewhat hand-made look that give them their charm. They're soft and nice to sleep with."
4,"Adorable, but issues","I love these dolls. I like the way they look and feel. They are cute (yes, cute, not ugly!) and cuddly and they seem well made. I got the huge Ice Bat at FAO Schwartz. My issue is the made in China thing, but more than that, it's the name. Why are we teaching our children the word ugly? I understand that it is the whole gimmick, and that's how they make money off us, but I wish they were called something else. I think the ugly thing is in poor taste and it just goes to show how sad we are as a society that we love things that are mean in nature. Some young kids don't understand when it is appropriate to use the word ugly, and when it is not (it should never really be appropriate) so this may confuse them. Kids with autism or learning disabilities may not understand that this is just a joke and may be upset by it, or they might think it's OK to throw around the word ugly. Created by bullies!"
5,I like that is is not quite the norm,"These dolls look cool. They are different than your usual stuff animal. It's ""ugly characteristics make it endearing.I keep it on my couch in the computer room."
5,Dark Valentine's gift,"You know the girl. She's smart, wears a certain amout of black. Hates the world. The one you're in love with. Get her this for Valentine's, but don't tell her it's for Valentine's (she probably hates that holiday) But, only if she like Pugs. And pink, for some reason. It's ugly enough to not be cutesy, but still cute. She'll love it. Mine did."
4,Tubtime Fun,"I was pleased with the quality for the purchase price. Make sure you are aware of the dimensions before purchasing or you may be surprised when it arrives. It is not a large toy, which makes it fit in the tub nicely. The pieces are a little too small for babies that do not have developed hand-eye coordination, but this can also help improve that. Of course my tot spends most of the time drinking water from the detachable whale instead of actually twisting the red dial to make water flow, but fun all the same. I bought the same product for my nephew and he enjoys the toy too. The only flaw is that the clear plastic tub part that the ducky floats in is a little thin and will be susceptible to cracking. The duck itself is not a squirt toy so it will not mildew inside. For the price, it is a good purchase."
1,Great Holiday Songs,Another Great CD by the Talented singing sisters Ali and AJ. they have Great voices and i look forward to more cds from them in the future.
4,Great for Xmas,I love the cover and the girls do a great job. Although I really wish Rockin Around the Xmas Tree was included.Maybe some more traditional Xmas songs too but I still loved it and as always they don't disapoint. They are flawless in vocals and it was great for Xmas day.
5,He is back!,"Wow, what a great album! If you like Bryan Adams , get this album without hesitation, it's really good. A little too short maybe but quality is better than quantity. When I listen to flying , I feel like I'm levitating up in the clouds. That's how good it is!! Good job Bryan!"
5,Awesome Remix Album,"I'm probably one of the biggest Newsboy fans you'll ever meet, I have every single one of their albums (yes, even Read All About It and Hell is For Wimps) so naturally I was going to buy this whether it was good or not.However, it is fantastic for a remix album, and is much better than the original Newsboys Remixed. My personal faves are the Wherever We Go, Secret Kingdom, City to City, I Am Free, Your Love is Better Than Life, and In Wonder remixes, but all are great. If you have to, just buy those on Itunes, but I suggest buying the album. Oh, and I'm not 13, just don't have an account."
2,The Alcoholics,"Jim Thompson enjoyed a drink too much. He readily admitted this and his book The Alcoholics is his novel featuring his experiences in institutions where people dry out.The novel is very short (122 pages) and a quick read. It is not very enjoyable as the characterisation is limited and there are too many people one would want fleshed out more but the limited novel length prevents this.There are some adult themes in the book as well as coarse language that was not common in Thompson's works normally.I think that Thompson's main strength was the ability to create a storyline where the reader's imagination worked overtime on the horror of what he was writing about. This novel had a fair bit of that but as other reviewers have stated, was just missing that essential ""something"" that made it a quality read."
2,interesting as a product of its time,"Jim Thompson's The Alcoholics was first published in 1953. The paperback copy I checked out is a Canadian edition from 1993. This guy is a crime writer (well, he was, he apparently died in 1977) with a supposedly (according to the New York Review of Books) literary bent.I found it interesting enough to read through to the end, but it seemed quite contrived and simplistic to me. I would imagine that's probably just a result of its being a product of its time, though. In any case, if real people were like the good and bad characters in the book, the world would probably be a much nicer place than it is, but perhaps not as interesting."
5,the drink masters good book,love love love itbeautiful pictures and allpeople borrow it all the timegreat buyi use it as much a possibleand i have order more and gave out as gifts
4,Tomatoes,I use the Storey series to help customers in my landscape design business.They are a concise and an inexpensive way to support my customers with landscape maintenance questions.
2,Skip this book.,"I read the book as my therapist suggested it. I should have looked at the publishing date, which is almost 20 years ago. I learned more years ago reading Men are from Mars Women are from Venus. This book will end up at the used bookstore, if they will take it."
5,Makes one think about what's really behind the investigation,"If you want a real appreciation for what goes on ""Behind theScenes"" in an airline investigation this book will crystalize itfor you. The story that unfolds is itself riveting, but themachinations that the principal investigator has to endure arethought provoking. You might very well appreciate those folksyou see at an airline disaster scene after reading this one.Written by someone definitely in the know."
2,Final Approach- by John J. Nance,"After reading Nance's thrillers, such as Pandora's Clock and Medusa's Child, this book was a major dissapointment when I finally forced myself to read it. It started out excellent, with a very good crash scene. However, by the middle, continuing through the end, no action occured at all. It is a book that can educate you on the inside of the FAA, NTSB, and airline industries, but if you want action, this book will leave you feeling deflated."
2,The only reason I read this book to the end was...,"... because I love airplanes. Other than that, a reader with average intelligence will always be two steps ahead of this rather predictable tale. However, Mr. Nance has a lot of insight into how the aviation industry is regulated, and it was a pleasure to read a novel written by somebody knowledgable about the inner workings of the FAA and airlines."
1,Uh oh - here come the amenity migrants.,"As a resident of one of the LAST of these towns to actually remain (somewhat) affordable (and those days are numbered, I fear), I'd like to thank both author and publisher for doing their part to run creative people out of the increasingly expensive towns that they worked - through long, difficult years - to create. There's nothing like loving a place to death. We all owe you a real pat on the back.-David Alston"
3,No Subtitles!,"This DVD Box is supposed to come with english and spanish subtitles but what a surprise, it comes with no subtitles!"
4,The only way to watch the series is all together,A ball of light approaches the earth. Nothing can stop it. When it gets here it deposits 4400 people that were abducted over several decades. Why were they taken? Why were they returned? What does this mean for the rest of us? The story may not be what you think if you have not seen it on T.V. However be assured that you do not have to go through the whole series to find the purpose.The box of four seasons is the only way to watch. If you like extra goodies like voice over commentary it is here. Personally I just like to go straight through. Big warning the fourth season ends expecting a fifth that never happens. There have been movements on the internet to revive a fifth series. To continue the series you will need to read the books based on the series. I checked the kindle and they are not text-to speak enabled so you will have to read the old fashioned way.
4,Interesting,"An interesting collection of literary works analyzing the over-abundant classes that exist in our so called ""classless society."" Authors and musicians Point out that while we strive for limitless society, we will always be restricted by our class, with very few exceptions."
4,"Great, but...",Great case - easy to use and to remove from belt. Only hassle is having to remove my m505 to hot sync and charge. The case would be be perfect if it had holes for the cradle.
2,Purchased two a year ago. One has failed,"Bought two of these a year ago (almost to the day of this review).One of still working great. The other one has failed. It's not a communication problem, and I cannot figure out what is broken. Batteries are fine, and the transmitter is < 20 ft from the receiver, so communication is fine. The receiver seems to be unresponsive to any of the buttons.The worst part is that it failed in the ""Raining"" mode - which means I didn't figure it out until my grass started turning green from no watering... When the unit fails, it should never fail in the Rain mode - ever. That is just stupid design.I am going to swap out for a wired version that is 1/3 the price."
1,A jacket for oddly shaped dogs.,"The dog's width as well as length should be measured. My dog is too thin for the jacket to stay on, but it is the right length, except for the front. The front is too long, so she steps on it. We have not been able to use it at all. The dog in the picture looks like a Bichon, and our dog is similar. There is no way that jacket would fit that dog."
4,"Cute, Good for Fussy Pups",My pups want to go out at the most inopportune times! This keeps them (and subsequently my house when they come back in) dry and allows us to get the exercise we need no matter the weather. I wish the hoods were larger though.
3,cute but way too big,"Measured twice, ordered once -- and our Havanese couldn't walk without tripping in it! Coat is well made, but the size chart is wrong - -I ordered mediums for both dogs and they looked like walking blobs of color - -the understraps are way too long to be useful...and for our short legged creatures, they still got wet on their bellies and legs - -so even if I somehow made the coats small enough for them --they would still be wet! So never mind..."
2,Shoddy workmanship,"A nice little stool for kids, however, after only one day of use, I had to reinforce all the glued and stapled joints with screws!"
1,Healing Alternatives for Beginners,"After reading Ms.Henrion's first book and utilizing her herbal remedies as well as relaxation techniques I found my health greatly improved. I was eager to learn more and looked forward to reading Healing Alternatives for Beginners. Like her first book it is very concise and easy to read. I do miss the teddy bears from her first book but the affirmations scattered through out the book are great. I like that the information presented is backed by research as well as Kay's personal experiences. Highly recommend this book to anyone who is fed up with ""traditional"" medicine where we pop a pill for anything and everything that ails us."
5,The original Vinyl Baby at his best!,"Baby Doc is undoubtedly one of the most aesthetic, expirirmental, and musically talented DJ ever to enter the DJ scene. The music on this CD is absolutely unparalleled to music by any other DJ I've ever listened to. ""Never a DJ: Live in Australia"" is a total must for every trance, techno, or DJ fan."
2,bad clip out of box,"This seemed to be just what I wanted, but I had to send it back immediately. One of the legs' last segment just collapsed, the clip wouldn't lock at all . Sending back and going to try again. Thank goodness Amazon is so good about returns or I would just give up on this item!"
4,Small and sturdy,I got this for my DSLR Canon Rebel T3i and it works just fine. I wish they'd send a carrying bag with it.I'll edit this if more comes up.
3,Wonderful Design; Crappy Contruction,"I really love this tripod as a lightweight, compact tripod for my LX3. But as others have mentioned, the contruction is not the best. The grey plastic collar, just below the head, which is used to dial in the angle of the legs, easily gets stuck between settings, and even when I had it locked in to the standard angle, one leg would pop the collar out of place and go off at a random angle. I also don't like the 4 section legs. I would have preferred 3 as the extra 3 sections really can add a lot of time setting up, especially when that perfect shot comes along...but I know it would have been less compact with only 3 sections. I still would reccoment this tripod, for the price, it is still worth it. Just use it carefully, and plan on buying a new one every year or two if you use it daily."
3,Great lightweight tripod with some problems,"I bought this tripod in Dec.2006 and used it a lot until it broke in Jan 2010.Like most other negative reviews, my tripod broke where the flip mechanism rotates and it became a pain to use; leg sliding by itself, not enough height, and I had to used it with duck tape for a while. However, I would like to stress that this tripod produced great pictures with my Nikon D80 and traveled with me a lot, it might have quality problems with the plastic, but it makes up for it with its weight. I doubt I would have carried a heavier tripod as much as I carried this one and it worked perfectly well every time. The head might not be as sturdy as I would have liked, since positioning the D80 on its side sometimes proved too much weight for it. Would I buy it again...maybe, I think overall is a great tripod with some quality issues, if Manfrotto could fix the plastic problem and put a better head locking mechanism it would definitely be the perfect tripod for me."
1,ATEC Rubber Tee review,I am very disappointed with this tee. It broke the first day we used it and the rubber kept getting worse. I should have purchased the yellow one.
2,Just Bunch of Fighting,"The costumes are great. The photography is outstanding. The locations are very scenic. The story is mediocre.A renegade army officer hires out to transport a sacred Buddhist relic across the country. The bad guys are after it, and in the meantime an assassin from the Emperor is assigned to kill the renegade officer for disobeying orders, but becomes an ally instead. There's lots of fighting along the way. End of story. There is no intrigue, there are no beautiful women to add some balance to the story. Just lots of macho fighting"
2,Not nearly on the scale of some other Chinese epics,"I bought this movie after reading some of the reviews on this site, & now I wish I hadn't. The movie is OK but if you really want to see this movie just buy the DVD. First of all the picture quality is not worth to get on Bluray. You don't get the awesome cinematography that you do in other Chinese epic films like 'Crouching Tiger', 'Hero' or 'Flying Daggers'. Second, the story is a little bit contrived and the characters not all that interesting. The scale of this movie & the way in which it was shot gives off the feeling that it's a B-rated flick in fact. If you really want to get this I will gladly sell you the one I bought for cheap."
2,Looks nice but really boring.,"I can't fault the Bluray, the movie looks really nice. Too bad it is extremely boring - just rent this instead."
1,"""Anna Nicole""","This movie is awful! I recently bought it at Movie Gallery and I wish I hadnt. The biography part is pretty much dead on but I hated that parts where the ""dead"" Anna was popping up and telling the viewers how much the world was crazy because of her death. Oh please, Anna Nicole Smith was and is the last thing on my mind. Let alone her death."
1,Just junk,"Bought the system, used it for three years, it worked fine . Then one day the HDD crapped out. I had purchased a second one to use at home, same model. Hooked it in,immediately said it didn't see the HDD. No response yet from SVAT. Have a feeling I'm SOL. Company has too many negatives now, would never purchase from them again. Guess you get what you pay for. It is too bad that Amazon doesn't ban them from selling here."
1,"great concept, but ultimately unrealized","...i waited a whole year to see the fantastic photos described by the editor, so the disappointment was a crushing blow -- let me be frank: this book does not contain the photos described. nor does it teach me anything new about homoerotic desire ... nor does it's photographic content approach the quality of it's scholarly writing. unfortunately many scholars dream great concepts but don't follow through in their practical attempts at creating what they've described. lucie-smith is a fantastic writer, but he admits in the introduction that he isn't a trained photographer..."
4,"decent rig, not for tactical model.","nice rig but dosent fit the tactical, front sights are higher for suppressor and dont fit in the holster.Just replace the stock sights with some night sights for a full size usp and your in bussiness."
5,food safety,The book is thorough and provides many self quizzes to test your knowledge along the way.
5,ServSafe Coursebook,"I am really pleased with the book i purchased. I needed to find the book fast for my class because it was the middle of week one and i had no book because the college bookstore was sold out. So, i tried online to find the best rates with fast delievery and found it here at Amazon.com. Wooo! I was so happy to have found the book i needed onine with the Scantron Certificatiion Exam form included. I was in the need for next day delievery and they had that option available. My total came out to $93.83 with next day shipping fee included. That was a pretty reasonable price for me compared to other prices i've seen which would have been way over $100 dollars. I am very happy with the book and with the speedy next day delivery and also with how Amazon.com kept sending me confirmation emails and how i could tract my shipment order. I was very much pleased, which moves me to trust them and to purchase from them again in the future! Thanks Thanks Thanks Amazon.com!"
3,'Kira Georgievna' - An English student's viewpoint,"I am an English student in London, studying Russian for A Level exams. We have been studying 'Kira Georgievna' as one of our texts, and have found it very challenging. Kira, a sculptress, is depicted by Nekrasov with sensitivity, although her character is by no means one which can be sympathised with. Her relationships with the many male characters in her life show her inability to commit to anything. Her lover, Yurotchka's naivety is taken advantage of, which shows her selfishness and egotistical nature. Her elderly husband Nicolai Ivanovich is a pathetic character because of his infirmity and apparent obliviousness to the way she leads her life. Vadim, her first husband, re-appears to further Yurotchka's self enlightenment, and eventually awakens Kira to her own selfishness. Overall, the book is an interesting exploration of many characters, not least in it's detailed depiction of Kira herself."
3,Abstract.,"I am an English student translating Kira Georgievna and am finding it difficult to translate and therefore difficult to understand. Therefore I am in need of an english version as to understand the book better. If anyone can help, please get into contact with mr."
4,Fantastic collection,"Unfortunately, I had to order this book through another supplier due to some problems here at Amazon, but I have to say, this book is great, as are the other Harmony Guide books that I have. Some repeat stitch designs (very few), and lots of new and beautiful ones. My only real criticism is that the charts in the book seem to be hand-drawn and lack the uniformity found in the other crochet books I have, which the charts appear to have been done with a computer or something. Also, they don't seem to use the abbreviation for Front and Back Post Stitches in the written instructions for the stitch patterns, and the chart for the Crossed Puff Cables (which is gorgeous and I can't wait to try it), shows all Front Post Stitches on right and wrong side, rather than Front on the right side and Back on the wrong side, which seems to be an error. But if you've already got your basic skills in place by the time you get to that one, you should be able to fix it up no problem. :)"
2,Beware of hidden glutamates.,"This is a high quality product with nice flavor but the label is misleading. This tuna is not packed in water, it is packed in so-called vegetable broth which sounds innocent enough unless you are the type of person that gets headaches after eating in a chinese restaurant. This soy broth is like virtual MSG. MSG deadens portions of your tastebuds that tastes rotten or fishy flavors and causes tumors in lab mice.If you can eat MSG/Glutamates without any problem this is an excellent product and the pouch is very convenient. I am sorry to see that Amazon no longer carries Starkist tuna in a pouch packed in sunflower oil. Their sunflower oil packed tuna is by far the best tuna I have ever eaten and would reccomend to any tuna lover."
1,It's terrible,"I bought this card to replace my Diamond Viper II Z200, 32 MB, AGP, it was a complete mistake. Since the first moment I installed the Hercules card I started having promblems. I have a flat panel monitor at 1024 X 768 X 16, the icons and letters lost the clearness I am used to. I also experienced problems with some games. I tried everything, new drivers, different frecuencies, etc, nothig solve the problems. I also submitted Hercules a request to see if this card was compatible with the Creative Dxr3 DVD decoder card, never get an answer.Finally I have to reinstall my old Diamond Viper II card and everything returned to normality."
3,Go Forro!,"If you havent heard Forro (pronounced FO-HO) yet, you're missing out on a hot Northeast Brazilian music style. I've had the pleasure of seeing this band live. This band is five women, roaring voices, serious percussion. If you like American zydeco, you'll probably like this. Check it out."
4,The optical in/out is great plus 4.1 gaming too!,"I purchased the Yamaha TSS-1 which is a 5.1 speaker system with dolby digital and DTS decoding built in. My sound card did not have either a optical out or coaxial digital out to connect it to the speakers. The sound blaster live 5.1 did not help either as the DTS passthrough was not working with the TSS-1....After installing it I found out its a perfect marriage between the Yamaha TSS-1 and the Gamesurround card. You can configure it to direct power DVD 3.0(provided with card) dolby digital out to the optical out. As a added bonus you can connect 4.1 analog speakers for gaming. There is no point spending $99 for a sound card with a DD decoder if your speakers have a built in decoder after all. EAX is not as good as the SB live! but its a good compromise between sound quality and features, another fact is that its not easy to find a sound card with optical in/out for below $75 these days."
4,for ms Day fans,its a cute little story but nothing to tell the world about. replay value is purely for the Felicia Day fans
3,Nice Display that Lasted Only 5 Years,"I bought the VG2021m ViewSonic 20"" LCD monitor in 2007 for my father who used it almost everyday for at least a few hours. The display was great. The monitor became harder to turn on / stay on once the power button was pressed until it finally died in 2012. It was purchased at Fry's Electronics for $290 so I expected to last longer. My old 15"" Samsung LCD from 2002 is still working--ten years later."
4,A nice movie but what's up with the DVD cover,"I saw it on the Sundance channel and I fell in love with this. But the cover on the DVD cover is very misleading. It makes it look like it's some scary movie when it really isn't. It's a story about a young girl that is killed and becomes a ghost and her friend is the only one who can here her. Most of the movie is seen through the ghosts eyes. So, Don't be fooled by the case cover."
5,Loved it!,"The 1st time I saw this on Sundance, I had to have it. Not so much gore like American horror. It leaves you guessing."
4,Interesting,"I found this book educational, comical, and well worth reading. In less than a hundred pages it taught me a lot about medieval Japan. What I enjoyed more is the way its original author's voice comes shining through in the text. His condescension, his bluntness, his matter-of-fact all make for a hilarious introduction to the mind of the samurai. Some of the statements that come out of Shigesuke's mouth are a world apart from what we hear in textbooks today. He has no problem telling the student that he is a ""lazy"" ""moron"" ""coward"" unless he is exactly what a warrior should be. But beneath all this there is wisdom here. A very interesting book."
3,It is JUST the code,I would have liked if this book got a little more into the reasons and practice of the codes in a more modern way. It is just an English translation of the codes they way they were originally written with very brief explanations. Still a good basic time held way to live with honor in a deeper sense.
3,Very light but wobbly,"The unit is very light and collapses to a very short length but you have to compromise with very thin segments on the monopod, especially the last segment. It's a bit wobbly with my 5D, grip, 70-200IS, and 580EX."
2,Good for smaller cameras,"I had this about 1 year before it broke. The top most locking clamp broke right at the hinge and now it is useless. I'm a big Manfrotto fan and this not their typical build quality - this is a bottom of the line monopod.When it was working I found the last (smallest) section was too small to use. Because this is not a round tube, it is oval, the small section is not stable at all, it wobbles a lot with a heavy camera and glass on it. The foot is also so small it sinks into all but the hardest turf.If you have a consumer model Canon Rebel or a Nikon D40'ish camera this will probably be OK. for me it is just too unstable."
4,"Short, refreshing poetry","This book is full of poetry that is nourishing to the spirit. I am not sure why it is organized as 365 poems (as that number generally implies a prayer a day) because they are topically arranged into seasons of life. Many are about birth, many are about death, croning, coming of age, etc. They are fantastic if you're seeking something to open a discussion group, a reading for a multifaith gathering (I borrowed the copy at my Unitarian Universalist church). It's a great book to have to pick up when you're feeling a desire to have a greater appreciation for the rest of the world."
5,Best of Kenny,Watching Kenny from the beginning of his career until recent times was a tremendous experience. It was a fitting tribute to a great singer and entertainer.
2,Kenny Rogers,I love kenny rogers but this movie I did not like at all. I ended up selling it back to amazon I was so disappointed.
5,Great DVD's for kids,I got this as a gift for my neices and nephews. They love Max and Ruby !They watch it over and over.
4,For My 2006 Mustang,"Yeah, this camber bolt function great. Also it has a jam nut! and their 10.9 grade able to to torque them good"
3,It Was Alright,"I enjoyed the book quite a bit, however, there was one thing I disliked about it. This goes for most of this authors books, but the majority of the characters all have an above average intelligence. It just makes the characters lack diversity, as well as making the book seem less realistic, although it is a fantasy novel.With the exception of my prior statment, the book was marvelous - I paticuarly liked how they made Grundy golem a main character this time, because in previous books the main characters always seemed to be Bink or some relative of his.Over all, I think this is a good book if you are a fan of this author or this genere. Its not the best book of his I've read, but it was good."
4,not bad at all,Gamma 4 sure does not sound like the previous three albums but you can still hear Ronnie wail on his guitar on most of the tunes on this cd. I would say get this to complete your Gamma collection. I believe you'll come to enjoy listening to it after a couple of spins. I am not disappointed for buying it and I'm sure most Montrose fans won't be either.
1,too fatalistic for Type A readers or those remaining realistic but positive,"I bought this during the gap between my lumpectomy and chemo. I found it horribly depressing, with quotes like ""you'll never be carefree again"". Yes, there will be some changes in my lifestyle, but that's also true of diabetes and other diseases/conditions.Her whole attitude seems to be ""when"" the cancer returns rather than ""if"", which is not how I intend to live the rest of my life, however long that may be."
5,You must read this book on the road to recovery,"I received my book today and had to sit down and start reading it immediately. As a breast cancer survivor of 4 years, I could not wait to read Hester's observations. I wish I had had Hester's valuable insight into the issues that arise as treatment finally ends, and we are faced with picking up all the pieces, earlier in my recovery. Hester has absolutley hit the nail on the head. Even though I was diagnosed 4 years ago, I consider myself still recovering, so I guess it is never too late to come to grips with some issues. Thanks to Hester for bringing these things out and helping with solutions.If you or a friend are facing these issues, think of this book as a gift to yourself."
5,A must read,"For anyone going through breast cancer this book is invaluable. Not many books tackle the challenge of ""After"" breast cancer and this one helped me so much after my treatment was done."
5,Slow and gentle argument,"This book is a very well-thought-out argument in defense of the rational over faith-based reasons for what truly is. I found it gentle, persuasive and easy to read. If you read this and experience any outrage or insult, it is clearly a case for you to resolve in the face of such self-evidence as Dennett illustrates so well. You are necessarily obliged to think and re-read, I'd suggest. A fine work of non-fiction."
5,Good work!,"You don't have to be an atheist, an agnostic, or any type of believer to engage this book. That's the whole point, in fact. No matter what your belief (and they are all related to belief), subjecting it to scientific scrutiny can be fascinating and revealing, and especially so with this type of academic yet extremely accessible writing.A beautiful combination of serious purpose and playful joy in the arguments comes through here, and it's infectious. What does NOT come through is any kind of anti-religious agenda, which is easy enough to come by elsewhere and does nothing to advance anyone's cause.I read most books once or twice, and so I get them from the library instead of purchasing them, but this is a book to own. Dennett provides plenty of food for further thought here, and you will come back to his ideas again and again for just that purpose."
1,What a ghastly book!,"I can only echo other reviewers - verbose, dreary and with enough errors to destroy any shred of credibility. It's particularly sad as Dennett is an intelligent and articulate man with whom I generally agree. But this?""This is not a book to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force."" if I may (mis)quote Dorothy Parker..."
3,A bit of a dissapointment.,"This work has a lot of interesting information, and is a very resourceful piece. Certain chapters make for an incisive reading, and the analysis of religion today in the States is fascinating. Overall though, it's a bit of a cluttered presentation of the material- it doesn't quite fit nicely into a coherent or engaging piece. Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion is a more clear cut and arresting piece."
3,Red Meat For 'Brights',"Knowing publishers often foist overly provocative titles on books, I expected a somewhat even-handed look at whether religion is, or is not, a natural phenomenon. And, indeed, after opening the cover, Dennett seems to be promising just that in the first chapter. But after going the whole 339 pages (less appendices) I'd say large sections of this book are a screed. That's not necessarily bad. If you are already a 'bright', or at least think the 'spell' needs to be broken, you will generally find it a well thought out, entertaining and reaffirming book -- a 4 or 5 star read. You may even convince yourself it's a dispassionate view. I have two problems. First, the self-proclaimed objectivity does not sit well with the sometimes rapier sarcasm. Second, in his enthusiasm Dennett too often goes off on short sidepaths causing the whole train of thought to bog down. This can test one's desire to pick the book back up and keep going."
2,DON'T JUDGE A BOOK (or in this case sewing kit) BY IT'S COVER!,"This gift really fools you, it looks like it comes with a full basket full of threads and needles, etc but its really just tiny spools of thread and really small, crappy scissors. Even the pin cushion is minature... I was giving it to my mom as a christmas present but when it came in the mail I thought it looked more appropriate for my 7 year old sister.. It's ok for an add-on gift, but I don't suggest giving this to anyone as the only gift."
1,Not worth the money,"As soon as bought this product and opened the case to put the included items in the velcro closure broke. The tray is made of flimsy plastic and would not stand up to regular use. It is quite small and, for the price, not well made at all. I returned it for a refund and would not purchase another like it."
1,Very cheesy!,"I purchased the sewing kit to go with my new sewing machine that I received for Christmas. The velcro for the closure was unattached as well as the closure being held on by one strand of thread. The workmanship on this item is ""shoddy"" at best. The removable tray was bent out of shape and I don't foresee it being worth much. If you return the item, it appears that you lose your original shipping cost as well as paying to return the item. I do not recommend that anyone waste their money on this item; no matter how good the picture looks."
3,Wrong item and no reply from seller,"I ordered this remote for Roomba for $29.99 but I received a docking station and extra battery instead. I contacted the seller explaining what happened and asking what they suggest I do (wanting to exchange and do the right thing) but the seller never responded (now 2 months later). So I ordered another remote (different seller) and I have a wonderful 2nd docking station and backup battery (worth $100). Hey, if they wanted it back they'd have responded! 1 star for completely wrong order, 5 stars for the value compared to the item ordered!"
3,Good but not always self operating,"I love my Roomba and thought the remote would make me love it even more. Perhaps I'm not using it correctly, but when I first start it it's fine, but when I want it to change directions, it does, but then I have to keep holding down the go button to get it to start again. I don't use it all that often because of this."
3,Very forthright in his writing.,"Colonel Steele, a strict military man, as well as a man of his word, writes his memoirs in much the same way as he lived. His courage and bravery, as well as his honesty, come through just as history has recorded. He did not give praise lightly, nor did he speak ill of anyone without just cause. His word was his bond and not to be broken. A definite insight into the history of that period, as well as into the man himself."
5,No draining required....,"This tuna is easy to use right off of the shelf. It does not requrie draining. We use it for salads, sandwiches and tuna noodle casserole. My son will often just open the package and eat it."
4,Great for convertibles,"I bought one of these three years ago, and it works adequately. It will keep your back and ass dry, but not necessarily cool. This is great for me, since I work in an office environment, but live in Texas and like to have the top down on my car. This way I can drive to work and leave the car without looking like I've been doing yard work all day.Unfortunately, the cushion is ugly and...hot. The polyester/acryllic fiber that the softer areas are made from is skanky, but you get used to it. Also, this is not good for chunky folks. I'm probably even borderline on this one. In order for air to move upwards into the cushion, it's very stiff. If there's too much weight on it, it pinches the airways off like kinking a garden hose, making it useless."
2,"Really dissapointing followup to the great ""Group Sex""","On this album, the tunes are longer, more drawn out, and more dull than they were on the undisputed punk classic ""Group Sex"". Now that is a five star album, but I guess the Jerks weren't up to the task of creating an equally great next album. They certainly didn't. The songs don't have the humorously offensive yet angry lyrics of the previous album, or the speed and flow. ""Question Authoriy"" and ""Moral Majority"" are good songs however. It's an okay album, but not a punk classic by any means."
3,Better than ATW,"The Boys know how to do a good video, and this is a good transfer of their body of work. Unfortunately, that's it. There's nothing special about this DVD that takes advantage of the medium. No stills, no interview footage, no timeline, two web links (both official sites). There's also no excuse for the complete absence of ""Drowning"" from the disc (at least an audio track would have a nice touch if the video wasn't ready in time to be included). Well worth having if you're a fan, especially if you've got the other videos on tape, but it is only the minimum of what should be expected of a major DVD release."
2,Very Disappointed,"Well as a Backstreet Boys fan I'm glad to have a dvd of all their music videos but I am very disappointed that for the videos of ""Everybody (Backstreet's Back)"" and ""All I Have To Give"" they only have the short edited versions and not the full versions. I find this to be very ridiculous. And also that the video for ""Drowning"" isn't on there. It's on the ""Greatest Hits"" cd so why not be on the DVD as well?This DVD is a real disappointment. Only get it if you don't have high expectations."
1,BAD buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Was very pleased with this card to start with but was very disappointed when I tried to upgrade to windows XP and found that this sound card would not support windows XP. I tried to go to the Hercules web sight to find a new driver but found no help and was forced to remove windows XP till I could buy a new sound card. Now Hercules sits as a dust collector where it belongs. Do if your looking for a card that will support upgrades from windows 98 then DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Wow..tabs are way off,"I was so excited to find this book because it was such a great collection of AC/DC songs all in one place. Then I started to play a few of the tabs and thought huh? This is way off. I'm no AC/DC expert so I did a bunch of research online and sure enough, I confirmed from countless other reviews that this book is far from accurate.What a disappointment."
1,Wipes Container,"I should have listened to the reviews on this one as they were not too high! It is very cheap, more for a dollar store! The only thing sesame street about it is a big sticker on the front, big deal.... It never closes tight and the wipes dry out all the time! Very very poor item, unusal for Amazon as I buy so much from Amazon and eveything is always great! Not this item, don't waste your money!"
1,TOTAL GARBAGE - DO NOT BUY!,"If I had been able to see this in person before I bought it, I wouldn't have paid $0.99, let along $8.99. It doesn't stay closed - there isn't a latch or anything. Without a rubber band to hold it closed, this thing is completely useless. AVOID!!"
1,Do not waste your time with this book,You are much better off with Kaplan or Princeton Review. The sample tests that Arco offers are not reflective of the actual LSAT (other books actually use real LSATs)and their explantions of the answers are not very helpful. The best prep is to buy the LSAC Triple Prep books.
2,...No radio mix??? What a waste of time!!!,"The beginning of the album version is waaaaay too slow and boring, the radio mix has more of Eve's rapping and more background effects at the beginning, it's so much better. What a waste of money!!! If you want the album version, just buy the whole album, the album version of this song on its own is a total waste of time and money. the radio mix is available on a separate version of the single and also on itunes-it's longer than the album version and is just plain better!!!"
1,Contender for worst movie ever made.,"Oh dear! were words that sprang to mind within minutes of starting to watch this. On the titles it listed Brian Krouse, not the guy from charmed surely? It is, just spelt wrong in opening credits. I am really not sure exactly what the plot of this film is, it was really inconsistant and badly made. I expected a cheap sclok horror that was so bad it was good, it is actually amazing how bad it is. The acting is most poor but the main actress does a fair job of annoing the hell out of the veiwer. I hope that was intentional anyway. Killing scenes don't makes sense, the explaination is ""we do magic"". it really has no redeeming features, avoid like the plague."
3,Fun,"Its different to the norm and has non stop action/bizarre moments. Its seriously funny and the characters act it well. Certainly not boring more interesting, challenging and will make you gasp time and again in its unpredictability and bizarreness. Entertaining and isnt that the point."
4,Holds up reasonably well,"This was my favorite show when it was on. I'm glad to find it here, it has been well over 20 years. It holds up fairly well. The cars are dated and it funny to see the huge car phones they use rather than cells. But, the plots and acting are great. Story arcs tend to last about 10 episodes, so there is time to devlop characters, especially the great villans. It is fun seeing future stars like Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey. Jonathon Banks is great as Frank McPike, Vinnies handeler. You will notice similarities between Frank and Mike, the character he plays on Breaking Bad."
4,Amazing TV show,"It's hard to believe this was on TV before I was born. It's one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. The missing episodes and songs that some other people mention are kind of a drag, but since was a twinkle in my daddy's eye during the original run I haven't missed them yet."
1,not worth it at any price,"if we are not going to get a version of the Proffit finale with ""Knights in White Satin"" there is NO point in purchasing the DVD set.After reading all of the other reviews - I can take this off my wish list."
5,FINALLY!,"Wow, I thought I was the only one that still remembered this great tv-series, but its release on DVD proofs me wrong. Thanks TPTB for giving me the chance to relive one of my first great tv-memories!"
2,Cheap price and cheap quality,"Music issue as mentioned by others, but in addition, its not playing well with four interruptions on the first three episodes. Two minutes of a crucial scene can't be played with numerous video pixelations elsewhere. This may go back."
1,Whoa,"Episode 3 of CD 1 is horribly mastered, like a 12-for-24 frame transfer rate. Like watching Russian television. Or watching it ater a bad bad bender.Great series, and this is the first problem I've had with the DVD releases."
2,not what i thought,"this is a cookbook, and not a reference book, which was what i was looking for. it has many recipes in which i never heard of, mostly foreign. Haven't tried any of them, i cant even pronounce most of them. but if that is your cup of tea, then maybe you will like it,like i said, it has many recipes in it, good luck."
4,Tubing seems strong and resilent,Gave it a four star because it can slip in your hands. This product needs the test of time and use to fairly rate it.
1,This workout is just plain WEIRD.,"I am at a loss really to describe this workout. It stinks. This is a very easy workout for starter's so definitly NOT for an intermediate/advanced exerciser.Kathy Smith has tried to be 'cool and hip' by making this workout just plain weird. She is working out but she is super imposed onto various backgrounds and this gets to be very annoying because the backgrounds change frequently. It really is hard to describe but it seriously gave me a headache from the constant lights flashing. Oh, and there are two segments where she even has light flashing like a strobe light effect and you're left wondering, why???To sum it up, if the Hollister stores ever sold a teen workout, this would be it only they'd need to ramp up the volume 20 fold.I'm telling you this is the weirdest thing I've seen come from a noted workout instructor."
1,HATE IT SOOOO MUCH!!!!,"Ahhhhhhhhhh! Can't stand looking at her, and it seems like she isn't really with the other people. Horrible layout and just couldn't get used to it. My heart rate didn't stay up and i just went back to doing my favorite Leslie Sansone DVD after fiddling with this horrible video. UGH,but at least it was cheap and came on time. Kathy is just old and saggy looking and way too skinny so i didn't like looking at her and her attitude is so darn annoying. no more Kathy Smith for me i guess. I liked her older stuff,but they are most likely on tape"
3,way too easy,"Well, let me start with saying that I really like Kathy Smith and I own at least 5 of her other DVDs that I use frequently ( esp. the great Timesaver series! ), but this one..Minuses:- it is way to easy - good for beginners or maybe for your not-so-fit days. I didn't even get warm.- Kathy is a bit annoying with her 'I'm loving it!', 'Isn't it fun?', 'I'm having so much fun!' etc.- everyone is working on the same level - well she says you can improvise your hand movements when you're working 'the clock', but nothing more really. Sometimes you can't even see the entire cast!Pluses:- I liked the Matrix abs section - I could feel my muscles working- cast is not miked, so you don't have to listen to their 'oohoos!'"
3,"Good book, needs work","I purchased this book for my Social Statistics class at CU. While it was as described in the product description, their are many problems with the actual product, especially for a 5th edition. There are many poorly worded definitions, a poor glossary, and an incredibly large amount of typos. A decent book for low level statistics, but not much else."
2,I don't like it,"This book is just not very good. I don't like it. Also, releasing 6+ copies of the same book is GREEDY!."
4,These are great!,"We bought 2 of these for our sons, ages 6 & 4 1/2. The boys love their seats. The cushioning they sit on is much more comfortable and thicker than any other seat I've seen. My only complaint is about the reclining hinge; it doesn't hold well. This isn't a problem when the seat is on a car seat with a sleeping kid in it BUT every time I have to move the car seat (from one seat to another or one car to another) the hinge lets go, and the pieces (back & base) separate. It's a little frustrating. The reclining option is great, no more sore necks or slumped over kids but I think they could have designed it better. All in all, I would definitely buy them again."
2,"okay guys, let's be serious",this is generic. nothing special. stupid cheesy harmonies and super-polished 'suffer' era bad religion sounding music with that incessant double bass peddle. all the songs sound the same and the lyrics range from generic to absurdly pathetic. the problem with the punks today is they worship this kind of garbage and have no idea what d.i.y. is. fortunately i did not pay for this.
1,its kewl,i think that that after listening to the cd that it is pretty cool and my girlfriend cedar crawford seems to think that they are all that matters in life..... isnt that right cedar... cedar crawford and luke holder forever. minden nv.. if anyone knows who me and my girlfriend are go ahead and email me.....
2,a novel with too much starch,"No matter how hard I tried, I could not get into this novel. Perhaps it is the translation, it may be wooden. I don't know Italian, so that's only a guess. Maybe the translator did the best with what she had. But as I read, I had the strange feeling that every sentence was written in the passive voice. I felt very distanced from everything. SEARCHING FOR THE EMPEROR is surely more a hippopotamus than a gazelle. From the very first sentence you feel that everything is decided, given, and written in stone. All you have to do is read how the people felt about it. Are you so interested ? This is what you will have to decide if you choose to read this book. I think the world is full of many other novels. Try them."
4,Best clumping litter on the market,"This is the best clumping litter on the market. It is virtually dust-free and the odor control is excellent. I bought it to use withOmega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Pewterand, as far as clay litters go, it does a pretty good job. I will probably go back to using silica crystals, as they are my favorite. They absorb the urine, rather than clumping, which prevents you having to scrape a clump of litter off the bottom of the box. But this is just the best clay/clumping litter I have ever used and it deserves high marks for that."
2,Too Violent,"It started off, just too violent. I just shut it down and found something else to read. I recomened it to someone else."
3,Cookie Cutter Western,"Good, or at least decent, acting and filming, with excellent costume design. On the other hand, ""Yellow Rock"" subscribes to every modern Western pee-cee stereotype. It includes the Black Paw, a noble (but fictitious) tribe that apparently lived in total bucolic peace and harmony with Mother Nature and each other before the coming of the greedy and brutish wasichu. The Black Paws' injuries and ailments are treated by a gutsy white female doctor--living in a time when, unfortunately, female doctors were almost nonexistent in this country--who is infinitely more aware and able than all the stupid, bumbling, smelly white men who trespass onto the Black Paws' burial ground(yet do, admittedly, include one decent fellow among them).Even those who enjoy such elements will probably find the whole story horribly formulaic and predictable, going nowhere really interesting in the end."
4,Sleak & Stylish,"This is probably one of my favorite Mexican series to date. It is sleak and stylish. The cinamatography is excellent. The actors are attractive and do a great job. The characters are well developed and the action sequences are pretty exciting. I love the sets and the panoramas of Mexico City.The series is intended for a more adult audience as there is quite a bit of violence, some substance abuse and scantily clad women abound.This dvd collection is in Spanish and there are no English subtitles available!"
3,"Fun as hell, boring visually...","well i bought this game and got what i knew was coming to me. the adventure was great but the game lacked in the overall look compared to its xbox 360 version which is completely acceptable considering wii owners know about the wiis graphics capabilities, lets put it this way its mapping is similar to some old arcade games like house of the dead...but the characters up close look great. the sword fights in this game...well i would say pretty much the whole game u will be spending time flicking ur arm around like so nutjob....sometimes there are so many soldiers to defeat at the end i gotta take a brake cause my wrist is so soar....but thats the fun in it the ability to actually physicaly fight..... but anyway this game was one of the new greats for wii unlike spiderman"
2,A good but short game,"I am a kid and I bought this game as my first game for the wii, being as I am a pirates of the caribbean fan. The game itself is fun, with the swordplay being really cool, but the game is way too short. It has around 8 levels, each one taking 15-30 minuets. You can also do Challenge mode and dueling, but the story is really short. I beat the game in 2 and a half hours. Also, only half the game is at worlds end, the other half is deadman's chest.Overall I was disapointed."
3,Worth playing..,I bought this game for my sisters kids 15 and 11 years old...though this game is very short..they absolutely loved it..!!
5,excellent book on architecture,"This book has filled an essential need in the study of American architecture. Every person, every student, every traveler must have this book in hand."
2,"Forever the man, forever a fan, but not of this dvd","I've been a fan of the Nature Boy for quite some time. This dvd came out to a lot of hype, but didn't live up to it. It seems as though they just put a lot of the information in it that was told in the first Ric Flair dvd that was released, with the exception of his retirement. The song that they put to the story line was good, but it is grossly over used in the dvd. It looks like it was rushed, which the WWE is becoming famous for, and poorly put together. The matches they included are average at best, and definately not the definative collection. Had I known what this dvd was like before I bought it, I wouldn't have wasted my money. I watched it once and haven't looked at it since."
4,"Mel woos, wins, loses--and sings","The concept is hardly original--a song cycle that charts a brief love affair--yet the tune themselves (particularly ""One Morning in May"") and Torme's vocal stylings make this well worth owning. It's one of his finest efforts. Though it may not reach the highs of the first Dek-Tette album or the ""Sings Fred Astaire"" album, it has all the grace and precision of Torme's best late-'50s singing.The dialogue intervals are corny yet charming. The girl's kiss-off line is great."
2,"I laughed, I cried, I'm glad I bought it used!","This book has a few good ideas interspersed, but is mainly a stream of environmentalist-communist propaganda laced with mysticism passed off as science. This book is NOT recommended for anyone who cannot independently glean the few grains of wheat from the tons of chaff."
4,A MUST have computer bible for beginners!!,I would recommend this book for anyone who is an absolute beginner. All text explains in plain English with hardly any program jargons.
5,About as Good as Punk Can Get,"I own a wide range of punk albums, from the old (London Calling, Never Mind the Bullocks) to the kind of old (Machine Gun Etiquette) to the modern (Punk in Drublic, ...And Out Come the Wolves). Out of all the great punk bands that I've heard and all the albums I listen to, not a single album keeps me coming back as often as Suffer. To me this is as good as punk can sound and as much as punk can offer. While all the songs do sound the same, the melodic, pounding beats and riffs produced by this band are so enjoyable that you won't mind the song similarity, and the incredibly deep and meaningful lyrics are a surprisingly satisfying bonus. No band will ever sound like BR and no punk album will ever be as great as Suffer. Buy this if you don't already own it. And if you're a punk fan and you don't own it, well then just kill yourself."
2,Conventional management- we have heard it all before,"Asthmatics are now better informed and can research the effects of medication, allergies etc very easily. This book has nothing to offer to HELP people with asthma. It adopts a very narrow approach specifically using medication.One point that the book fails to discuss properly is the Buteyko method for asthma. The Buteyko methid without doubt the best help for asthmatics. It works by correcting breathing and reducing hyperventilation. I am always dissapointed as a once chronic asthmatic to read asthma books offering the same stuff. The only thing that ever helped me was the Buteyko method. Unless your asthma book has the details of this- it is letting asthmatics down."
5,One of the Dropkick Murphys best,"Do or Die is a classic DKM album, powerful fist-pumping punk rock with some Irish folk thrown in for good mix. Much better than the straight punk 'Gang's All Here,' and equal in caliber to the excellent new album, 'Sing Loud, Sing Proud.' Punk Classics like 'Get Up,' 'Barroom Hero,' and 'Faraway Coast.' ALso, check out the 'Early Years,' its great stuff. And definitely see these guys live- they are insane!"
3,"not a fan of ""Blue's Room""","I purchased this, due to my son has just discovered Blue's Clues and loves it. I was hoping that Blue's Room would be similar enough for him to like it, but it just isn't. Blue is annoying by talking directly to the camera and thus the child and saying ""hey you"" frequently. The fun they have in the room is also frenzied and just not enjoyable.I love the Blue's Clues episodes, but wish the whole video was Clues and not room."
2,Good News,My son didn't like that they didn't play blues clues in the movie like the other blues clues shows. But he did start mimicking the letter sounds.
4,tried and true,"I've been working out with Kathy Smith for years. Weight Loss Workout is my hands down secret weapon for getting back in shape. Although it's nearly an hour long, it goes by fast and keeps your heart rate up the entire time, no matter what fitness level. Highly recommend!"
1,over rated,"THe item was received tangled, and it took me 1 hour to untangle. Put it on my ankle on Saturday, and looked down on my leg on Thursday it was broke. Very thin item, to delicate to wear at any time. Good for show pience in the box."
5,Gail Kim's Awesome first Movie,"Fans of the WWE or TNA will recognize Gail Kim as the Evil ninja. This movie is actually very well made with plot twist you would never expect. The fight scenes are awesome, as Gail tries to kill the girl and the Hero tries to save her. Even the police suffer the wrath of the evil Gail but some how our hero survives. until the end......Maybe. A must see for action junkies. Gail kim may be the female version of the Rock, I can actually see her making more movies of this type."
3,Fair,"This is not an exceedingly nice book. However, it served to clear up some of the confusions I had previously. The purpose of this book is clear. It is a philophical textbook for the beginning undergraduate level. As the book goes on, there appear, in my opinion, certain misrepresentations, especially those concerining connectionism. However, the historical introduction in the first chapter was very much enjoyable and other philosophical concepts are presented very lucidly."
5,love it,I've only seen 2 episodes of this show yet I'm dying to see more! I'm actually about to buy it now because I don't actually get it on my own TV unfortunately. It's not really much like LOST.. but I love both the shows actually. Corbin Bleu is my favorite =)
1,Dont waste your time watching this,"Bo Burnham is the worst ""comedian"" ever. I barely made it through this sad sad show. The only reason why I watched it is because it was FREE on my Netflix instant view. If you want to watch someone who is actually funny I would watch Lisa Lampanelli, Kathy Griffin or Margret Cho to name a few. Don't waste your time or money on this trash. Bo Burnham likes to make up stupid little songs, well Weird Al and Adam Sandler have been doing that for years and they are 100 times funnier than this 19 year old brat talking about bj's."
5,simple is good,This has held up well for 3 summers now. Really simple and easy to use. We have it mounted on the corner of the house and stretch it diagonally across the yard to the eye-hook on our detached garage - the only trick to making it work is getting the right distance apart so the stretch uses the entire cord. This way it is taught and stretchy for hanging.
2,Plastic Breaks,"Ours was mounted outside. In the Pacific NW, relatively mild weather. But it seemed to get brittle (from the sun?) and the mounting bracket broke. Too flimsy to be of any long term use. A little metal in the mounting bracket would be nice. This is cheap plastic."
4,Works fine for me,"We bought two of these (Not sure if they were the exact same model) about 2 - 3 years ago. They look identical to this one. The original two are still working fine. The original brackets did break off, but I was able to replace them with metal brackets and they have worked fine ever since. I was surprised when I opened the new one to find that the mounting bracket was metal. Either the previous two were a different model, or the company has upgraded to metal mounting brackets. It still looks plastic in the picture, but what we recieved was metal. I installed the new one in between the two old ones and they all work fine. The new one also has a different coating on the line itself which seems not to be as slick and holds the clothes better. I am satisfied with the product even with its plastic weaknesses."
5,Follow-up to a classic,"This is Astin's follow-up to his classic ""Four Critical Years"", which was one of the most cited books in the higher education literature. This book sums up some of Astin's more recent research and is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand what a college education is all about. This book is jam-packed with REAL research!"
3,"beginning bad...middle ok...end awful, next books amazing!","I love LKH, Charlaine Harris and Kim Harrison. These books got great reviews but I read the first 100 pages and thought it was awful so stopped. A few years went by and I have now tried again. The first book is v. mediocre. The last fifty pages are so sappy it's unbelievable and the dialogue b/tw the brothers is so silly.But books 2 and 3 are incredible! (Have not gotten further yet) So it's worth it. Also, the author is intelligent and I have convinced myself that the dialogue and writing style is quirky and amusing rather that a sign of poor writing. Some of the lines are just hilarious. It's like Rocky Horror Picture Show, you just have to go with it."
1,Intruiging but a total let down in the end,"Although the story line was very interesting to begin with, the sophomoric - no, actually childish - attempts at dialog train-wrecked this book for me. I became so bored with the rhetoric that I gave up and skipped anything where any of the ""brothers"" tried to talk to one another. The sex scenes were great in the beginning, but fizzled in the end as well.Too bad - the idea of a vampire society with a highly organized societal structure hidden among us was fun to contemplate. Have to agree with the poster that cited lack of credibility - really, Zsadist? Phury came accross as ""furry""...."
1,It Seems I'm in the Minority....,"I always start my reviews off the same -- I don't write many reviews, but I felt the need with this book. I'm not really sure what the appeal of this book is to the general public. There is no real character development, the story just seems silly and the dialogue is painful. I am most upset by the dialogue - it is pedestrian and juvenile. The members of the Brotherhood are supposed to be hundreds of years old, seasoned and mature. You wouldn't know it by their vocabulary -- ""hey baby"", ""right on brother"". Give me Matthew Clairmont from A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness any day of the week.I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and that is what this is, just my opinion. It feels like Ms. Ward phoned this one in. But Dark Lover has earned a lot of good reviews, so as my title says, I am in the minority.That said, I will not be reading anything further by this author, as I could barely finish this book."
4,Good Book,"It took me a while to get into this book...about halfway through exactly. I thought it started off slow, but I do realize that introducing all of the characters takes time. Once I got into it, the story was great. I would recommend going forward with the series...the books get better every time."
5,#1 in the Black Dagger Brotherhood Series,What a ride. These books are large but never boring. They are well worth the money both for the amount of reading you get and the great writing within. The twist on the old vampire lore to create a new and interesting world is fresh and works well. The humor is great and the characters are endearing and funny. No long capes and chamber music. These guys are black leather and Rap music with bumping stereos in their cars. A must read.
5,great read,This book hooked me into the series and I couldn't get enough. I didn't know if I would really get into a vampire book but these bring you into a world that is filled with real world heartache and the love stories are easy to root for. JR Ward doesn't let her characters have their happy ending and never have any other issues. I appreciated the continuation through the other books. Great reads!
5,Perfect start to a series,I just wanted to say that this is a perfect start to a series. I love Wrath and Beth and I can't wait to read about them through out the series and can't wait for them to get another book devoted to them. You will enjoy reading this one.
2,Tohrment-ed Reader,"Man I was diappointed by this book. After all the glowing reviews, I thought for sure I'd found a winner. Wrong. It was entertaining at times, but a terrible let down as a whole. I was shocked by the continued use of abreviations (SOB, SOL, WTF?!) used throughout the book, as well as the gansta lifestyle for VAMPIRES! It was silly. Especially after recently finishing an AMAZING Young Adult vampire book (Twilight by Stephenie Meyer) that left me begging for more vampire/romance reading."
1,Twilight for adults...and not in a good way,"I bought the book because a co-worker suggested it, she said it was full of hot, steamy, sexy vampires. I've been an avid fan of vampire stories my entire life, so I've read quite a few of them. This book made me think it could be ""Twilight"" for adults (...and my opinion of Twilight is that it sucks)...all the craptastic dialogue, descriptions, and....the female smelled good and that's what made the ""hot"" male vampire fall in love with her. Lame. It's got the obligatory cop character, who is by far more interesting than any of the vampires that sound like idiot thugs. I just couldn't put my finger on why I wasn't getting into the story, it's because it reminded me of Twilight, except with sex...and not even hot sex, it was boring. Just plain boring. The dialogue is the worse I've read in a long time."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I read this book, on the advice of a friend, who knew I liked books with a little paranormal twist. While this is true, I do not like to read books that focus on every possible way to have an event/conversation lead to sex. And I especially don't need a blow by blow description of what's going on in the heat of the moment.Yes, I like finding ones ""soulmate"", but I have read books that focus on the building the relationship, or even first look love, but don't have them constantly exploring what will make their own personal kama sutra.Obviously, I am not the majority, based on reviews already given....but this is not my cup of tea."
3,"Not bad, not great, just okay...","After hearing and reading how wonderful this book was, I decided to buy it at the airport for my 14+ hour flight. I don't know about anyone else but the overdrive of the sexual urges, the unflattering lingo the brothers use, the matrix-like outfits of the brothers are a bit too much for me - a bit unrealistic in my opinion. In addition, the only thing that got me through the book was reading Butch and Marissa's parts. Wrath and Beth's story were not as interesting. I shall read the next book as another try of J.R. Ward."
5,This is good for those who hate Romance Novels,"This is not a romance novel, this is a Love story :). I am not a huge fan of romance novels because..(A). They generally have a story line that a 12 year old could have created with rauncy sex scenes of an over sexed teenager. But this book blew my mind away. Yes the sex is great, but the story line is awesome! At first this book had me worried because the sex started off so early, but I decided to give it a chance and I was not disappointed! I purchased the first book in fear that it would just be some rauncy book, but after enjoying the book so much I went out and brought the box set. I may have an extra copy of Dark Lover books, but I figure its a gift that keeps on giving. Who wants it? :)"
1,More cheese than fettucini alfredo.,"Yikes. Towards the end of the book I actually laughed out loud a couple of times. If you skip whole chapters, it improves the overall reading experience."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I love paranormal books. I read at least 5 books a week. Because I read so much I am always looking for new authors. I thought it was a great idea to use customer reviews to find new books. This book was almost a 5 star with a lot of reviews, but I was soooo wrong with this book. It should be filed under waste of time. It was written in such a terrible way. No character development, you were thrown into their lives with out even a partial back round. I also realize that every author will tweak vampires in their own way, but come on, they literally were like muscled humans, with no immortal power. Almost dying from a gun shot wound? I really feel dumber, having read this book. If you guys want an excellent author, I suggest Kresley Cole."
3,ok,"I like vampires and read this on the recommendation of co-workers. They love it, but this was a little too much of a romancestory for what I had in mind, especially to continue with the series."
5,Outstanding!,Fantastic love story with perfect mix of action! Could not put it down! I will definitely be buying the entire series.
1,Just plain terrible,"I expected to love this book based on the large number of positive reviews it has received. After going through the torture of reading it, I can't believe it received so many because this book is just plain terrible. The plot is terrible and so is the writing. There isn't any real romance. This book is a porn novel. I like reading books that involve characters getting intimate, but not books where that is the only plot (if that can even be called a plot). One dumb line in the book is when the main male character tells the main female character that ""she tastes like peaches"". I usually give a series a second chance by reading the second book (then stop if that one is bad, too), but I will not torture myself again. I also will not read anything else written by this author. She is on my permanent DO NOT READ list."
4,Addicting,"Totally addictive! I've finished 3 black dagger books in a week, can't wait to start the next, love them! Not much of a review, but I'm no writer, just love to read!"
4,H-h-hot Series,"This is a great series! Each book focuses on a different vampire warrior, and his unique powers and internal struggles, as he finds (or stumbles across) his mate. And then in most cases has to convince himself (or others) that the woman is really his mate.There's lots of action, and sex. And the series is heavy with sexual tension.Excellent stories, characters with depth, lots of humor and sarcastic comments, great sex scenes...couldn't ask for more."
5,Best Vampire Romance Series EVER!!!,"From page one I was hooked by the characters and the world J. R. Ward created in this book. After the mind-numbing vampire fare that has filled the bookstores in the past few years, I didn't think I'd ever pick up another book in the genre. This series, however, turns the vampire mythology on its head. Original, compelling, dark--Dark Lover goes way outside the romance box, raising the bar for the entire paranormal genre."
3,Beth and Wrath,"I am not going to go into detail, I see thats been done quite well. Wrath is the leader of the BLACK DAGGER BROTHERHOOD and one of his ""brothers"" (he called the other members brothers so there is no incest involved when Beth and Wrath come together) asked for his help with his halfling daughter, Beth. Wrath refused at first but after his ""brother"" was killed he decides to honor the last request. When he finds Beth she is on the verge of changing, which causes her to become very sexual and their first encounter turns intense.***I have been hearing alot about this series and thought I would give it a try. I thought it was OK. I liked the mishmash brotherhood but I did not get a feel for Wrath and Beth. Overall, I would not recommend this book as a standalone novel but I am going to read the next in the series to see if it gets better. Surely this many good reviews must lead to better books on the way."
3,Ok,"The song is 'Warriors' by Yuichi Ikusawa (but I guess you know that). I haven't bought the cd, but I have heard the song and it's quite nice. It's used as the opening song for the fourth season of Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters.It's a bit pricey for just one song, but it's an import CD from Japan, so I guess it's ok."
4,Almost Perfect,I liked this series and was happy to find that the DVDs had been released at an affordable price. It has all the episodes and a featurette that explains a lot of what went on behind the scenes. The video and audio quality is good. My only problem with it was that it did not have subtitles. I would prefer if it did so you can make out some of the things that would ordinarily be inaudible. A booklet is included which makes for a nice bonus. This series would probably have been a hit should it not have been discontinued.
5,Finally back...but what might have been!,"Good that the unaired episodes of this exceptional, unsurpassed series are finally available (although they were aired in France where the show was a hit). Still a lot is left unresolved in the storyline since the series never got to a full season and thus didn't play out its complete story arc.And in the second season (or beyond), it was planned that Jim Profit would leave the corporate world and go to Washington so that he could create his particular brand of havoc in politics just as he had done during the first season in business. Can you imagine what that would have been like (certainly a series for TODAY!)It is so rewarding when evil at last triumphs...(with the release of this DVD!)"
4,So happy to find this,"I watched every episode of this show when it was on Fox in the late 90's, and I was extremely upset when I tuned in one night to find it pulled from the air. This show was definitely ahead of its time. It was very edgy and over-the-top. Even now when I watch the episodes I'm shocked at what I see.Regarding the discs, the picture quality is very good except for the pilot episode. That one looked like the 1,000th copy on the world's worst quality DVD. Other than that, I'm very pleased and would recommend this to everyone interested."
1,Not very good,There is not much to say about this show.Watching the first disk about half way though was more than enough. It's an idiotic movie. The guy seduce every woman he comes across and becomes very monotonous and mechanical. I am puzzled by people who think this show is worth 5 stars. Perhaps they haven't seen good shows to compaire?The show moves very slow and there is not much that keep my interest.
3,A Crime of a Catalogue,"What could have been a very useful source of information about mysteries turned out to be a reference book to which I no longer refer. Page headings would have made it much more useful (as in an encyclopedia). Under an author's name, only some titles are included, but not necessarily the best, as a negative summary of the title seems to be as likely as positive. I find the book useful for dipping into for suggestions, but not necessarily for finding the best information. The most useful part was a list of ""must-read"" books at the end."
1,AWFUL!,"I was enticed by the glowing reviews of Rebecca Reilly's book and the glossy photographs, but I have made several of her recipes and they are terrible! I have been baking for many many years but since I was diagnosed with gluten intolerance a few years ago, I have struggled to duplicate the wonderful treats I used to make. Reilly's sensibilities are all wrong; her recipes are sickeningly sweet and her directions are not nearly specific enough. Beware of the Armenian coffee cake and the lemon bars because they will send you into a sugar overload. And her vanilla pudding uses too much cornstarch and it is thick and yucky. Her chocolate chip cookies crumble the second you remove them from the cookie sheet. I'm sure she means well, but if you're looking for perfect GF baked goods, please don't waste your time"
4,classy,"These are classy recipes. I love the flour base, can use brown rice flour. The banana bread recipe is amazing!!! If you are looking for some classy deserts/treats - this is the book for you! Some nice pics, just a great book."
5,A roadtrip from your favorite chair!,"I own a couple of route 66 books but I think this one is fast becoming myfavorite. It is like taking a roadtrip from the comfort of my favoritechair. The ""then and now"" photos really give you an idea of how many thingshave changed and strangly enough, how many things have stayed the same. Awritten history accompanies each photo and gives great insight into themotels, towns and cafes that once thrived along 66. It is hard to put down!"
2,Should have left this pie in the oven longer,"The pietasters are the best live ska band around. This albumn however, is not the band I have seen live two times or the band on their other c.d.'s I own. This c.d. sounds like it was made quick and for the MTV generation. Such a shame. The pietaster have incredible sound and are very talented musicians. You wouldn't know it on this albumn. You like ska? Buy their live Strapped albumn. It is the best ska albumn made. Stay away from this stinker, unless you are a diehard pietasters fan. This is one of those albumns where the artists try something new...and just doesn't work."
4,Bish on Peter Greens Fleetwood Mac,"I like music-im sort of a collector-i dont download i like to buy the album and see the albums artwork-as far as this album is concerned this is nothing like ""fleetwood mac""this is very old at the beginning of fleetwood mac-it sounds different than regular fleetwood stuff-but its good chill music-its ok in its own way."
1,Mistaken Identity,"I intended to purchase the MP3 for Fleetwood Mac, Fleetwood Mac (white cover). When I clicked to buy the entire album, the Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac came up, whatever that is. I downloaded the latter by mistake and it IS NOT the Fleetwood Mac that I have in vinyl. In my opinion, it's junk."
2,Where's Greeney,"If you want to hear Jeremy Spencer - this your album. If you want to hear Peter Green sing, you'll like this somewhat. If you want to hear Peter Green solo, man are you out of luck! Download Merry Go Round (Take 2-Master Version With Studio Talk/Remix) and I Loved Another Woman (LP Version); also after some stops and starts I Loved Another Woman (Takes 1-4) has a whole version, Take 3?, then stops again!If you like songs stopping and starting you'll LOVE this! Why didn't they just put all that stuff at the end of the tracks and let you listen first to the album they way it was initially intended?"
3,Very good... BUT...,"I tried this fruitcake at my in-laws. This is the best fruitcake ever for your taste buds. It's got the right amount of fruit, nuts, and liquor combination. However, this is not the best fruit cake health wise due to the trans fat (partially hydrogenated oils) in it. In the US, if a food has less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving then the food can be labeled as having 0 trans fat. However, if you have multiple servings then that's a different story. Trans fat leads to all sorts of health problems and it sticks to you for a long time. It's super hard to burn off. It's so good that I almost want to overlook the trans fat in it. Trans fat should be banned. I would rather pay a higher price for food that are trans fat free."
2,"Gave it a 1 out of 5 for the simple reason only One dvd would play,","The other 3 DVDs in the set where so badly scratched up that no matter what i tryed they would not play on any DVD player,i was able to get them buffed out to play tho, so i will bump it up to 2 stars"
4,Good Humor,"I started watching Ranma with the second season actually (it's all the rental place had). This is a really good opening to the series and is a little more true to the origional comics. I've laughed outloud more times than I can count. I only had a few problems with it. The voice actress change for the femail Ranma on the english version was a good move (the origional sounds a bit like a chipmunk), but I wish they'd had the second actress from the beginning as in the clip eppisode it becomes clear how they don't really match. But, if you turn on the Japanese version (which is a bit better cast in my oppinion anyways), it won't matter. Other than that, it's not the greatest series I've seen, but it's up there."
2,GREAT STORY OF MAMMOTH EXTINCTIONS,TOTALLY UNREALISTIC VERSION OF HOW THE LARGE ANIMALS OF NORTH AMERICA BECAME EXTINCT....... HUMANS DID NOT EAT ALL THE SABRE TOOTH CATS NOR THE WOOLLEY MAMMOTHS......
4,A convincing argument,"For years Professor Martin has been making a convincing case that mass extinctions and extirpations occured whenever people arrived at a new location, from Hawaii and New Zealand to North America and Wrangel Island. In the book he shows that arguments against human-caused die-offs do not hold up. What was interesting to me was his idea of reintroductions. It had never occured to me that it might be beneficial to the ecosystems to replace the extinct populations with new populations. I would love to see it happen but of course I'm not holding my breath. It is hard enough to convince people to live with pumas, despite the indisputable fact that you are far more likely to die in a collision with a deer than by getting eaten by a predator. But reading the book gave me a new perspective on some of our debates about wild areas. In particular, I will definately look at feral horses and donkeys in a new light."
4,fine film,"Well-done film with fine performances by all. I watched it because i will watch anything with Joel McCrae, and I am glad I did. Humor and lessons in ways to show love in a relationship are all part of the show. Worth checking out."
5,Favorite new born gift,We received this book when we had our first child and it is a staple gift for all of our friends having babies. It is a great book that young children cherish listening to and reading on their own.
3,Fun Yet Typical MJD,"I agree with the other reviewer who said not to read all four of the short stories in DEAD AND LOVING IT all at once. Read back-to-back, although a quick read, the stories are all extremely similar--there are even phrases in the stories that have been used, word for word, in the one that came before it.That said, all four stories deal in some way with werewolves, specifically ones from the Wyndham clan. The stories are short, sexy, and to the point. Although I enjoyed the premise of all of them, the use of the ""c"" word to describe the female anatomy irked me, so much so that I had to, at times, set the book aside.However, SANTA CLAWS, MONSTER LOVE, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A WEREWOLF, and A FIEND IN NEED are all fast-paced stories that die-hard fans of MJD will enjoy. Overall, not a bad book, although the typographical errors and the repetitive phrases (even some entire scenes appeared recycled from the previous short story) keep it from being a true winner."
3,a great read for a great cup of coffee,"This is a great book to read if you're a fan of Mary Janice Davidson. It four novellas that are all tied together with reoccuring characters. If you haven't read any of her books, you may find some of the character refrences a bit off putting, but if you're a fan of hers this book ties up loose ends. She makes refrence to our friends the werewolves and even brings in our charming Queen Betsy. This book shows off her usual flare for humor and gives the females in each story a bit of sassiness that we all know and love. I gave this three stars because it's not one of her best, but a great read over a cup of coffee in your favorite cafe."
4,four amusing romantic fantasies,"""Santa Claws"". Werewolf Alec Kilcurt is lonely. That is until he sniffs his soulmate, who is a human female wearing a Santa Clause costume.""Monster Love"". Vampire Richard Hill looked forward to falling in love that is until he did. His beloved werewolf Janet Lupo can get into a rage over nothing and calming her down takes quite a bite of his patience.""There's No Such Thing as a Werewolf"". Dr. Drake is a rare physically impaired werewolf as he is blind. So he wonders why he vividly can see Crescent Muhn.""A Fiend in Need"". Vampire Queen Betsy Taylor is at her wits end and by George not over shoes. However, relief may occur as Wyndham werewolf seer Antonia Wofton arrives to help George the vampire fiend evolve into a beast of her choosing.These are four amusing romantic fantasies as MaryJanice Davidson once again entertains the sub-genre with an irreverent fun anthology from the supernatural side.Harriet Klausner"
3,"Ok, but a change in writing sytle...","This book was ok. I really liked the George the fiend story. Of course I read that one first, so that might have something to do with it. The first 3 stories were ok, but they could have been really good stories if there was a little bit more attention to plot/character details and a lot less sex. Most of the first 3 stories seemed to be about sex. I know plot/character development can be difficult in short stories because there isn't as much time to build in details, but it should not be substituted with a lot of sex details instead. I dunno, to me the first 3 stories seemed less like the writing style I've really liked in her series. That being said, the 4th was worth reading. I've always been interested in George the fiend, and it's nice to get some dialog out of him! :)"
5,Zesty and Fresh,"I use this spice mix almost everyday. It is very fresh and flavorful, with mild chili notes, and no one flavor overpowers another. It brings new life to my soups, omelets, and rice noodle dishes. I use other Bountiful Harvest herb and spice grinders, and the quality is excellent."
1,DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THESE GLOVES!!!!,"I purchased these exact gloves .... 3 (1 hour classes) uses later the seem blewout! I took them back to the sporting goods store I bought them for an exchange, went back to the section, removed another pair from the box, tugged in the area I had issues with and SURE ENOUGH .... APART CAME THE SEAM!I do reccomend the style ... just not the brand!!!!"
5,An intimate look at the birth and death of a town,"During the 20th century, textiles because the number one industry in the Carolinas, with most of the mills being established along river banks for cheap power and close to the raw product supplies--cotton. To get workers, the mills built company owned housing. Cliffside is typical of hundreds of such communities. Reno Baily's passion for his home town comes through as he chronicles the life of Cliffside.Cotton is no longer king. The textile industry has mostly moved to other countries. Cliffside held on much longer than many company towns. It is an important document for new generations who rarely will see an existing 'mill town'. Although the names mean little except to relatives and neighbors, it is important that this era in a community's life be kept alive. Reno has done that for Cliffside."
5,best punk album you'll ever hear,"This album is one of the greatest punk records of all time. It has everything you'd want in a punk record- great guitar solos, fast, upbeat tempos, masterful bass playing (listen to the introduction of 'You'), and perhaps most of all, bright, insigtful lyrics. This record has many hits, and my personal faves include Big Bang, Automatic Man, I Want To Conquer The World, Change of Ideas, You, and the title track. Hell, the whole album is great-no filler, all quality punk rock that remains unrivaled by anything past or preasent, at least in my opinion. If you are looking for punk rock, and not the imitation stuff thats coming out of mainstream groups these days, pick up No Control and you will see why it stands as a punk masterpiece."
5,This is my favorite punk CD ever,"Bad Religion kicks ***, and this is their best album. My favorite two Bad Religion songs ever (""You"" and ""I'm Gonna Conquer the World"") are on this album. Extremely intelligent lyrics accompany super fast hard core drumming and excellent guitar and bass work. Greg Graffin's vocals are incredible! Even though they have mellowed with age, they will always be my favorite punk band."
5,AWESOME !!!!!!,Was one of the best tv show in last 20 years and Jag lasted ten years not many show last that long anymorebut these was a good show.
5,Jag,This is a wonderful series to watch especially if you are a member or retired from the armed forces. Good acting and a great production.
1,Jag season 7,"One of my disc does not play so I need to return it some how and get a new one, can you help me with that."
5,good,"never missed this series, good clean show, anyone could watch it. What other tv series do you have? I also have Dr Quinn"
2,Tiny Black and White Pictures,"Tiny Black and White Pictures do not help you locate the part inside your actual bike. Without a clear idea of what the part looks like or where to find it, I never got past step 2"
4,Encanted Isles - Abeka 40762,Abeka Reading Program - This book includes dictionary for new vocabulary words.Over 70 short stories & poems. Illustrated.This is not the most current reader in the Abeka series but still a great reader for 4th grade reading level. Teacher's Edition is available for all Abeka books.
4,A bargain that rocks like this? Who would've thought...,"This is a great mix of a lot of up and coming punk/ska artists. I didn't like every song, but its the best CD you'll ever find for five bucks."
4,Entertaining,"Bought this DVD for my Father who was a Kenny Rogers. He was very pleased and like the selection of the songs. I viewed it with him, and I enjoyed it. Kenny was still charming and did a good job. His voice was not exactly as it use to be in his younger years, but not bad for a live performance. He seemed to select songs that were still within his range as well as his most popular ones. I would recommend it to a Kenny Roger's fan."
4,Lovely addition to collection,"I love holiday music and feel it has a comfortingand important presence as a seasonal ritual. Thisis lovely with selections new to me, and of course,the harp is always a calming pleasure. I recommendthis as a soothing balance to the sometime stridentholiday fare, and is interesting and varied musically."
5,Beautiful,This book tells how rainbows are made in a scientific but clear to understand way and the pictures of the rainbows are so beautiful!
3,Works great,"I took about a full bottle (168 tablets) at about 3 tablets a day. I felt the testosterone rise while i worked out and randome times during the day. When driving I sometimes just got chills in my spine (yes it was due to this) and experienced no negative side effects.The problem with this is that it ACTUALLY does do what it says and does it well. It enhances testosterone and blocks estrogen. At half a dose a day(it reccomends 6 a day) I was working out hard enough to cause small muscle spasms (usually due to membrane damage). Potentially this is the closest to a legal steroid you can get and can cause balding, thicker hair, deeper voice, acne, etc over prolonged use.So theres my review, the best ""legal steroid"" there is but I have read several accounts of those with side effects. Women will almost definatly get facial hair"
4,feel the effects immediately,"I have used T-Bomb II for a couple of months and it works like a charm. I don't take the recommended dose of 6 pills a day though. I only need 3 to feel the effects and regain my testosterone levels to where I'm ready lift a ton of weight, and always be in my top ""ready"" form sexually. I have also used Tribulus Pro from Vitamin Shoppe, but this is much more potent."
3,This is a good course,"I like the Spanish version of this course a lot. This one is good but there are a few annoying features. The interactive conversation was very slow to respond, just, really, slow. I also didn't care for the vocabulary section repeating every word in english. I guess if you want it, it is nice but it got on my nerves. As far as the success: it is too early to tell. Also, in the game section that stupid dog I just want to shoot him."
1,Version 8.01 has program errors,"I recently purchased Learn to Speak French 8.0. The latest version of this product version 8.01 (that was shipped to me) has known program errors. Version 8.01 DOES NOT work! I wasted a great many hours trying to install it. The Learning Company has received thousands of complaints about this product. Currently, They are trying to get version 8.01 off the shelf, and replace it with the previous version 8.0."
4,Great product,"I agree with a previous review that software can never take the place of an interactive class or spending time in a French speaking country, but this product comes as close as possible. I was amazed at how quickly I was able to ramp up on my vocabulary and comprehension. This is a great package especially if you are new to the language.The only negatives: First, I would rather it forced you to come up with the French words/phrases more. Too often it prompts with the French and asks for the English. Second, the dog in the game gets annoying reallly fast."
2,Unorganized learning process,"Although the software is extensive, with a workbook and audio tape, I found the organization of the program difficult. As a beginner in French, I thought that I would be able to learn more than I was able to from this program. In the first 2 weeks, I went through the program, listened to the tape in my car, and attempted to go through the workbook. What I found to be lacking was the fact that it focuses on vocabulary words and phrases before teaching the grammar and logic to the language. For those of you who want an actual understanding of French past a few vocab words, I suggest you look somewhere else. The tape was also hard to understand, even at the very beginning. The speakers talked too fast, so it made it hard for me to repeat after them since I was trying to figure out what they'd said exactly. Overall, it is a nice presentation, but I'd hoped to gain an overall understanding of the language, not just how to say, ""I'm fine, thank you."""
3,distinctly average,"This album is pretty good but not that great compared to some of their newer stuff. They have a few pretty damn awesome songs on this album like vanilla sex or professional crastination, (i prefer the rancid verson of vanilla sex meself :P)but like i said there's alot better albums like heavy petting zoo or pump up the valuum. But give it a shot it's has some pretty darn good songs on it i'm just not sure if it's worth buying :P d/l if ya want tis rare as hell tho lollol also he can't sing yet :P"
1,wrong item sent,"You sent me the wrong album, I ordered ""80-85"" and you sent me ""how could heel be any worse?"". Do you have the correct album in stock or not?"
5,Quality and well built set!,I owned Klein products and will pay to order more Klein tools. The handles are pretty comfortable. Very happy with the quality
3,Not bad,I started using the greenlee tools for a while but wasn't a real big fan so I went back to Klein. I don't care much for the grips they have on them now. They seem to were out much quicker than the old Klein. I may go back to greenlee since their grips are the same way and most distributors will return Greenlee without a fuss.
2,Nothing that interesting,"I bought this book hoping for some fun recipes to make on a sailing trip in the British Virgin Islands. Personally I found some of the ""historical"" comments a bit interesting, but besides that it wasn't worthwhile. The recipes weren't that great - more importantly too ""complicated"" for sailing life in my opinion (who wants to spend an hr or more cooking when you're on the water?). This isn't a cook book for quick, easy, tasty fare which was what I was looking for."
1,worst reliability of any product I've purchased in 3 decades,"Loved this phone for the first few years after purchasing it. Then the handsets stopped dropping calls as described by countless reviewers here.In our case:- I tried all of the troubleshooting steps recommended by Vtech customer support- I turned off our wireless router to rule out interference with itResult:- any handset, no matter how long we charge it, drops connection with base less than a minute after taking it off charger, and then the display goes dead and the battery indicator drops to no charge.I replaced the batteries on all 3 of our headsets. That fixed the problem instantly, and I thought we were back in business. Then the problem returned within a few months.The phone is now absolutely useless unless we use the speakerphone built into the base. I've always been an early adopter of electronics. I've never, ever, purchased a product as unreliable as this one."
1,Not a happy start...,"Received our VTech I5808 and I5871 with enthusiasm. The design is excellent. Installation went smoothly. However, within 24 hours we needed to reset the pairing in order to receive or make calls. After multiple resets, a phone call was made to the VTech customer support team. They were pleasant but brought bad news. In the customer service team member's script was a statement that the product offered through Amazon was most likely old and needed to be replaced. Further, he recommended that we return our phones to VTech, not Amazon. As a result, we packed up the product and shipped it back to VTech (at our expense) for a complete replacement.So ... the verdict is still out. Did we receive an old phone? Will the new phones be reliable? Will VTech promptly return new phones? In the end, will we be happy with our purchase?"
1,I'll never buy a Vtech again,"it's definately the prettiest phone on the market... but for it's price I expect it to last more than 8 months...same standard issue everyone else has - ""lost contact with base""unexemptablealso software does not work with Macs (an odd choice considering it's target demographics)zero stars"
1,"searching for base, searching for base, searching for base, searching for base","Aesthetically one of the nicest I've ever seen... But it only works 20% of the time. It's constantly searching for base, and dropping calls.. very disappointed."
1,captured by the design/never again,"I purchased this great looking telephone less than a year ago and have had nothing but trouble. I returned it for repair??? and I'm still having the same issues. The time reverts to some time of its own; I get VERY late messages, the hand set cannot be set as the menu cannot be accessed, and on and on. DON'T BUY IT Someone else will come out with a good looking telephone some day soon.Ellen"
1,"HORRIBLE, Drops calls, fails right after warranty.","Searching for base, dropped calls, poor speakerphone quality. Vtech stinks, will never buy one of their products again!!"
4,VTech i5871,"The connection to each handset is by USB (addressbook) and 2.5mm (audio). You transfer audio by playing the audio file on your PC and the handset listens. I wish you could just upload an .mp3, .wma, or other file! If you have several handsets, they will more than likely be out of sync recording tones by this method.Also, each phone has its own memory. Data is not automatically shared with however many phones you have in the ""network"". Also, the base and handset operate with separate configurations, e.g. ring tones.Other than above, the phones offer exceptional clarify and are quite fashionable. The display are bright, and battery life / talk time is very adequate.VTech could have paid a little more attention to the actual telephone features of the unit, but the build quality and asthetics are top notch."
2,Displays and labeling much too tiny.,"This is a really nice stylish system. However, if you do not have 20/20 vision, I would advise against buying it. The handset display and all labeling on the handset and the base unit is extremely small; I have to drag out my reading glasses whenever I need to use the phone or perform any functions at the base unit. Unfortunate, as everything else about this phone is awesome."
1,Sorry I bought the book,"Recieved this book just the other day. So many recipes I will never use espically for Christmas like Black-eyed pea stew, or Parsnip and leek soup. No pictures haven't found a recipe yet I would actually make for Christmas maybe the cookies? I don't think this book is simple to make it stress free. Not what I expected.I have a ton of better Christmas cookbooks thought I would give this one a try and sorry I did. I could not recommend this book."
5,"A great, translated anime art book!","The art of RahXephon, if anyone has seen the series, is obviously top notch. And it is distilled and published here. For anyone who loves the art in the series, this book is perfect. They display characters, colors, backgrounds and props with some description.For those who couldn't make it through the less then adequate story and writing of the series, this book is ALL you need. I sat through the anime knowing I would treasure the book far after the DVDs had collected a thick layer of dust."
5,Simply Amazing,"Dorinda is not only beautiful on the outside, but she radiates such a wonderful spirit and inner beauty that shines through. There is such an anointing on her voice and this CD is excellent. I listen to it from beginning to end. She's contemporary but at the same time, she does not forsake ""traditional"" gospel sounds. Dorinda really delivered the goods on this CD. Although, I am not surprised because she is from the legendary Clark sisters. Karen and Dorinda are my favorites. Highly recommend this CD."
2,Obviously biased.,I like this mag for the repair tips and reports on what is coming out. Don't ever trust a review here. You would think they would at least keep the ads and the positive reviews for a product from appearing in the same mag or within one issue...
5,I love Corelle!,"I am a big fan of Corelle products. These pasta bowls are good for so much more than pasta. My hubby and I use them at least 3-4 times a week for our dinner meal. They are a great size and not too deep if you want to put your meat and veggies in them. They are so light weight and when unloading from dishwasher to return to cabinet, I can carry 8 at one time with ease. The white color is a good base color as you can put any color with these to accent the dishes. The large bowl is a great serving bowl as it is lightweight and holds a lot of food. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to cook and eat!"
4,"Excellent, a must for your collection","Daniel Baldwin [Paul] attends his high school reunion and only three people were asked to attend. Days later two alumni have been killed. Paul is faced with the task of finding out the connection and who murder them. At the same time, Paul is dealing with the loss of his son in a pool ""accident."" Suspense and twists, a sleeper of a movie."
2,scant overview,"The writer I suspect was trying to pick up a few bucks when he wrote this light commentary on magical alphabets. You won't find practical applications or a depth of meaning regarding the runes.There are a few interesting stories about Austin Osman Spare, John Dee etc. A light fuzzy read. Not foundational."
1,Terrible Sound Quality,This album does not do Freddie King justice. The sound quality is terrible! If I would have known this beforehand I would not have purchased.
1,"Swiss Army, Aftershave","I think that the company did not send me aftershave. I believe that they sent to me a collonge called Swisss Army ""Tester"". I love Swiss Army products. Thank you"
2,Product Needed A Better Description,"This product was advertised as an after-shave lotion. A lotion to me, means sort of a creamy and moisturizing product. This is NOT a lotion, but rather a regular old splash-on aftershave.Product is fine if that's what you want, but I was looking for a creamy type after shave lotion/balm.Many times Amazon lacks the detailed descriptions of products, so when ordering you are playing a guessing game.Disappointed!"
1,SCREWED,"I WISH I HAD READ THE BAD REVIEWS , THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE WASTED MY MONEY ""WILL NOT WORK WITH MODERN 3D TVS OR PLAYERS""."
3,How do you do 3D?,"I purchased this DVD as I was around when the 3D movies came out in the 50's. My question is how do you view in 3D? There were no glasses included. I tried some of my old cardboard - red/green, red/blue and polarized from other 3D titles but they didn't work."
5,Vegan recipes with flavor...,"This is truly an exceptional vegetarian cookbook by an Australian author, full of new unconventional recipes that will knock your socks off."
4,Not my favorite.,I'm glad I added this to my collection even though it's not my favorite Black Keys. I would certainly recommend this CD
5,Best Napalm Death So Far,"I've listened to ""Scum"", ""From Enslavement To Obliteration"", ""Fear, Emptiness, Despair"", and ""Order Of The Leech"" and this album is by far their best. Killer riffs, solid musicianship, crystal-clear production, intelligent lyrics, and demonic vocals make this album a winner. Every song is good, but the best songs are ""Per Capita"", ""Farce And Fiction,"" ""Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind"", and ""Blows To The Body""."
1,Why Does Everyone Love This So Much?,"I don't understand why so many people love this series. I tried watching it, but it's just so boring. I started doing something else while I was watching it because I couldn't stand to just sit there. I wish I liked it so I could see what people are talking about, but I can't make myself like something. I really don't like the music and I don't like how the graphics are so gloomy and dark. Sorry to those who love this. I hope this review doesn't insult you, but I just didn't like it."
1,This is an unlicensed bootleg version.,"Wow, 26 episodes for $35! Too good to be true? Yep! Almost all of the sellers Amazon currently lists for this item are selling a bootleg. The original set has 6 DVDs and 1 CD. The set from the Amazon sellers is described by them as having 3 DVDs. The ""3 DVD"" version is in fact a bootleg made by the now-defunct Hong Kong Anime bootleger called ""FX"".Now, maybe bootlegs are your cup of tea, but I thought I should at least post a warning, since it's not obvious that these are bootlegs..."
5,See you in space cowboy,"Cowboy Bebop was one of the most visually stunning series ever and now the entire collection is available on DVD! The series follows the 5 crew members of the Bebop as they catch wanted criminals for bounties and find out the secrets of each other's past. Spike Spiegel is the main character, he has incredibly fluid moves and he lacks fear because he has nothing left to lose. Jet Black an ex--cop whom left the force because of the corruption. Faye Valentine, obsessed with money and lost her memory due to being but in cryogenic sleep. Ein, a super intelligent dog that Spike and Jet found. Ed, a 13-year-old girl who's a super hacker and after finding out about the Bebop on the net, she invited herself to join. Together this unlikely crew has many misadventures as they get closer to discovering the girl of Spike's past know only as Julia."
3,missing discs?,"well, i got the dvd package, and it was cool. i liked how it looked, and was pleased in how it was sent in the mail (bubble wrap...). but when i got it, i thought iwas a bit, small. so o opned the package, and i found that i only got three discs. that really threw me off, because wehn i bought it, i was under the impression that i would get all the episodes, spanning seven discs... but that is my only complaint. i won't rant on how great it is, or any of that because there is already enough of those reviews, and i am sure yo don;t want to hear it again..."
5,Rocks the Anime Show House,"I personally never really cared that much for anime, until my brother came home from college with a set of Cowboy Bebop DVDs.We spent the next two weeks watching everysingle one.This Anime is unlike any i have ever seen before, touching, yet funny. They do not make fun of stereotypical people, they use a touch of humor that almost any can understand.The ending was my favorite, a very touching one, unlike most shows. I won't say more, so i won't give it away. However, Cowboy Bebop is never repetitive in its shows, each unique (perhaps why it ended so soon) and will always be a favorite of mine."
1,Not worth the plastic it was copied on.,"This is a God awful movie. Mickey Rourke tries but fails to recapture his galant image from the orginal 9 1/2 weeks but fails miserably. Poor Angie Everhart was either desperate for a movie role and sucumbed to the casting couch or truly was in a state of despair when she performed for this role. After viewing this DVD I threw it away, it was not a movie I wanted in my colection, it is just garbage."
4,rourke and everhart steam up the screen,"I really like 'Another 9 1/2 Weeks. Sure if you compare it to the original the first gets the upper hand but there's something about it that I througherly enjoy. It has a good soundtrack, interesting and at times moody scenery, Mickey oozes sensuality and sex appeal. But what I find I think that makes the film work is because of the casting of the always gorgeous, talented, interesting, charming, playful-Angie Everhart. I adore Angie, she really is a special lady. There's something fascinating about her. Mickey and Angie have good chemistry together.I recommend at least a viewing of this film if one doesn't own this film already.By Justine Ryan"
2,A cure for insomnia...,"Unless you really like slow-paced, campy films, don't bother. The best part of the film is the beautiful scenery. The poor acting and campy effects really detract from the film. It's better to rely on good acting and great locations rather than mar a film with cheap effects that look cheap."
5,compelling eschatology,"In this, the last book in the Chronicles of Narnia series, Lewis again uses a compelling story to speak deep truths about the end of the world, God's judgment, the decision each of us must make at the end of time, and the dangers of false religion and false prophets. My five year old son, with whom I've been reading the series, was again transfixed by Lewis's evocative telling of the falling of eternal night on Narnia. At the end, we were both in tears but joyful, and he wanted to start again on the first book, so that's what we did."
1,Christians be aware! This book seriously contradicts with the Bible,"In this book, author C. S. Lewis gives dubious teachings that totally contradict with the Bible. Being wiser in this regard, I couldn't recommend this book to any Christians, neither children nor adults.The book, made by this so-called Christian preacher, claims that Aslan (there are clear references to Jesus throughout the Chronicles) and ""Tars"" (some other ""god"") are the same.Here's the translation of that claim (chapter 15, my translation from the Finnish version): ""My child, all that you've made to serve Tars, I take it as your service to me"". So it clearly states that believing in any other god is the same as believing in Jesus Christ and His Father. So Lewis totally opposes to the message of the Bible and the Gospels.What's more, this claim is intentionally in the book: my friend has told me about ""the pastor"" Lewis's teachings that are in line with this uncomprehensible distortion of the Word."
4,The Last Battle,"I thought this book was great. It was suspenseful in a way. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through it. Every page I turned, I wondered if the ""fake"" Aslan would be caught or would the Ape continue like nothing was going on? I recommend this book to anyone."
1,Destroyed everything worthy in the series in one stroke,"This book retroactively ruins all the other books in the series. It makes all the previous adventures and struggles pointless and reveals the grand fate of all the brave characters to be meaningless.There are so many things wrong with the plot, characterization, antagonists, and resolution... It is like this book was written by a different author, one who had already turned his back on the world."
3,A long advertisement,"I was somewhat disappointed with the item. I had seen the first hour on my local PBS station and assumed the rest would be more about the dramas and costumes themselves. Boy was I wrong! This seems to be one long advertisement for ITV's programs. Very little about how the costumes are created. More about the people playing the characters in the shows and the shows themselves. Lots of repetitive info about Alex Kingston fainting while wearing a corset, Colin Firth diving into the pond in P & P, Keira Knightley in Dr Zhivago, etc.Just be aware it's not about costumes (which is why I bought it), mostly about the personalities and the stories behind the filming. Pretty to look at but tedious after a while.May be a good donation item to the local library...."
2,"Some distortion, overly bright and uncomfortable headphones","There immediately was present a audio distortion/vibration in the ear speaker discernable in the lower to lo-midrange frequencies that was not in the music itself as eastablished when comparing the same CD on other headphones.The ear cushions are way too small unless one has very small ears. Sound transmits off the outside of the headpones at sufficient volumes so as to disturb other people that are within your listening proximity. Lastly, typical Chinese manufacturing quality (poor) and all plastic. Even at a discounted price these are headphones that are not worth keeping. Personally, I returned them back to Amazon and have great gratitude for Amazon's generous returns policy."
5,Best headphones I've ever owned!,"I've had these headphones for about 3 years now, and if I could do it all over again, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another set. For the price, I don't think they can be beat. The sound quality is excellent, with crisp highs, a relatively wide soundstage, punchy bass, wide range of frequency response, great transients & great clarity. They're very efficient. I use them at work with my 5g ipod and it can power them to ridiculous levels.I listen to mainly electronic music, jazz & rock, and it does a great job with them all. Highly recommended!"
4,A great album for the time,"I thought that Raven kicked ass, and after I heard this album I thought that they still kicked ass, a little more commercial than the previous works, but still a great metal album! Rock Dogs rock on!"
5,An excellent book all around,"This book is concise and filled with examples, screenshots and thorough descriptions of the entire process of database access and manipulation using VB. I recommend it to anyone interested in such a subject. It covers various db engines and gives a brief overview of SQL queries as well as delving whole-heartedly into ADO, DAO, activeX, ASP and just about anything else you'd care to know about. And nothing is skimped on. McManus also covers remote database access and multiuser Jet databases"
3,Not worth buying,"It starts out okay but then to me it's too much sexual intent for a storm story, will not recommend to any one."
1,Lousy product - not as advertised.,I got a big giant desktop and not the one in the picture - it failed in a few months and is impossible to fix.
2,a letdown,"I'm a big NOFX fan, but this album is a far yell from being great like some of their other stuff e.g. Punk in Drublic, Two Whites . . . . Mediocre stuff from one of the greatest punk bands that really doesn't suck, no matter what they say. Skip this one."
1,This is not one for you new fans...,"I've been a hardcore NOFX fan since like 1994, and I know that makes me relatively new, but to all the kids out there looking to add NOFX to their collection, this is not the one to start with. This being their first album, it kinda sux compared to their others. I bought it after having listened to and loved punk in drublic, heavy petting zoo, and white trash... My advice is to pick up one of those discs first. This one struggles because it is pre-jefe, and fat mike can't quite sing yet. The vocals aren't harmonious like the later albums, but it is is a decent punk album. only later when I look back, do I see its importance. Avoid this one, unless you're totally hardcore, then you might kinda like it. Start it off with Punk in Drublic!"
1,This band completely copies off Minor Threat!,"I used to like these guys, but the more songs I hear by Minor Threat and TSOL, the more I realize how the Offspring were just copycats. What a discrace to punk. I wish bands like the Offspring, Good Charlotte, Green Day, Blink 182, Simple Plan, and New F@g glory would just (...) off! The only ""American Idiots"" are the ones that buy into this boy band poser punk.""WE'RE JUST A MINOR THREAT!"""
5,Great- Old Punk rock,"This album is what should have defined the Offspring. It's their old, punk rock stuff, and it is the sh*ts!!! It might not be as popular as Smash, but I would rank it up there. All the songs are tolerable. In fact, I only found one song that was only OK- which was LAPD. The rest, including Session, We Are One, Forever and a Day, and especially Dirty Magic are just plain great. Don't trust the little previews that Amazon gives you- they are really bad quality. Instead, just buy it and you'll be glad. My only problem- it was too short. Only 37 min. of punk rock. Oh well. This is definitely worth the money."
5,Loved it!,"I ordered this DVD to help my daughter understand more about Alexander Hamilton. She had to read Money Men for school and I felt a few history DVD's would help her understand the material better. I agree with the other reviews in that the video is well-produced and easy-to-watch. Yes, there could be more detail on his accomplishments. And yes, there could be more detail on some of his bad ideas (we all have them ....). I was happy with my purchase and will buy more like them."
4,For the Pikachu inside all of us!,"Sometimes, maybe there is a thing called maybe it could go on and on. This was the start of everything. The episodes that brought on the next series of adventure, it is like Power Ranger, it never ends this way, and it never ends that a way either. It makes you want to draw out all the Pokémons and make you go Pictionary Pokémon, or just belch out all the Pokémon is alphabetical order. It is kind of more Japanese and true to the form of making it more for children than the ones on TV, where Ash looks like a beef up version of Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was a teen and with a mouse for a pet. If you could bear in mind, imagine it. Also, it makes Pikachu so much more cuter than Ash, which was what I like to see. Though, in the book, it seemed to cool the idea that Pokémon could be animals we have on our planet, but more of the imaginary animals we come up with. So, it is a little fluffy. And more twisted that way."
3,"OK, but not essential.","This CD single is for completists, really. The non-LP tracks are fine but not essential for the less serious collector. Not a complaint, just some perspective."
5,Nice bread,"I like this bread, and several other flavors in this brand. This one and the seven grain are my favorites. They bake consistently well in my Wolfgang Puck machine. Recommended!"
