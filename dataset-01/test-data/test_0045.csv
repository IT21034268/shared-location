3,"Not brilliant, but a good read","If you don't set your expectations too high, you'll probably enjoy this book. Ignore the hype and take it for what it's worth: not great literature, but a reasonably well-written, often absorbing portrayal of the geisha's world. Those who expect political correctness and/or scholarly exactitude should probably look elsewhere."
3,A glimpse into another world,"I appreciate learning about real situations in faraway places that are for the most part foreign to me, preferably through a well written novel with an absorbing plot rather than through non-fiction. I'm a literary fiction fan, but not necessarily a scholar. If such a foreign world seems exotic and mysterious and has a sexual element to it, these elements will only add to the appeal. So in hindsight it seems obvious that anyone who wrote a quality novel about geishas would have a major success on their hands, and that's precisely what Golden accomplished."
5,good read,"i loved the movie so i read the book and it was of course really great! i love the details of everything, it is a very interesting culture."
4,Learning about a different culture,I enjoyed this book because it told in detail what the life of a geisha would be like. The characters were interesting people and lived lives far apart from what we are used to here in America.
3,"Disappointing as literature, excellent as summer fiction","After all the hoopla, I expected better writing. The story seemed to me simply a vehicle to convey information about a Geisha's world. The research was obviously the point, not the characters. Even the descriptions seemed tired to me.However, the novel has all the requisite elements for beach reading: a character that goes from poverty to glamour, sexy scenes, a villian or two, and a happy ending. And you come away with some knowledge you probably wouldn't have otherwise - although another reviewer has called into question the accuracy of that knowledge.I'm glad I read it, but sorry I bought it."
5,Oh My,"I have read many a book, but this one took me somewhere in time I could never have imagined. It was all so real, I had to keep reminding myself that this was a novel. You could actually reach out and touch these characters. TREMENDOUS!"
3,Supurb descriptions and characterizations. Weak ending,"This book is overrated. If you want to read positive reviews, read the other reviews since I agree with many of them: the character is rich, the authentic descriptions of the geisha life is exoticly captivating, down to the last silk sash. However, the bad part is the ending: the novel does not end...it just stops. I think it is because (stop here if you do not want the ending spoiled) the protagonist does not find the solution herself; rather it is done for her by the man who she had been after almost all her life."
1,WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT THIS ONE???,"I DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THIS BOOK. EVERYONE RAVED ABOUT IT, SO I THOUGHT BETTER LATE THAN NEVER TO READ IT. WISH I WOULD HAVE SAVED MY MONEY."
4,bittersweet novel,"Startlingly realistic in detail and richly infused with bittersweet narrative, Memoirs of a Geisha is a must-read for anyone looking to expand their cultural horizons. Breathtakingly sad without being melodramatic, Memoirs tells the story of a young Japanese girl ripped from her peaceful fishing village to virtual slavery in the hustle-bustle of Kyoto's geisha district. Told in the first person, her tale reveals a young woman quickly becoming sophisticated beyond her years who in the next moment seems as nave as a schoolgirl in the ways of love. Those who would criticize this book for certain historical or cultural innaccuracies are missing the point, I believe. This book, after all, is a novel, in the truest sense of the word."
2,High-end trash,"Everyone in my Book Club raved about this book (I may now have to find myself a new Book Club). The writing was bland and simplistic and the book was far too long for the simple story it was telling. The characters left me cold; there was not a sympathetic one among them. The women were all scheming and duplicitous; the men unfaithful to their families and driven completely by the basest urges. If this is what constitutes a best-seller, remind me to stay away from them."
2,Terribly overrated,"I found it entertaining during the first several hundred pages, but ultimately this book left me flat. The characters were uninspired and hollow; the writing was at times just plain silly and stilted. Ultimately, I found ""Geisha"" to be little more than a garden-variety romance novel dressed up in fine silk robes. Save your money..."
2,Overrated!,"Don't believe the hype! The effort that went into creating this book is admirable, but this is a shallow exploration of a geisha's profession and of a woman's mind. It's crammed with details, but they don't add up to much. After finishing the book, I felt I had learned very little about the geisha arts. What was Sayuri learning in that school all day long? The narrative contains an abundance of cheesy metaphors and at times reads like bad haiku. The central romance of the book is implausible -- Nobu is a much more compelling love interest than the two-dimensional Chairman, and any woman as ""clever"" as Sayuri supposedly is would recognize this. To see a male novelist writing from a woman's point of view successfully, try She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb -- not Memoirs of a Geisha."
2,I haven't drunk the Kool-Aid...,"...Meaning, I am not enamored of this book. It was overlong, silly, poorly written, repetitive, it had cardboard characters, and was nothing but a soap opera which happened to be set in early 20th-century Japan. To top it off, the sex scenes were gruesome and boring.I was hoping this book was better than the movie (which I saw first), but it wasn't. Also, why glorify the lives of women who were basically just high-priced prostitutes, who sold their virginity and selves to the highest bidder?Real Japanese culture could never be as dull as this book."
5,"""Memoirs"" Among my all time favorites!","The mark of a truly remarkable book is wanting to read it again and again. I have read, and re-read, Memoirs of a Geisha over and over. Whenever I have an especially long train ride to face, I bring along my battered, dog-eared copy. Opening the book to any page transports me back to the beautiful and exotic world of Sayuri, richly pained by Arthur Golden. I know that there has been a lot of friction recently over whether the stories in this book were true or not. I believe that the author's intent was merely to provide a historically-based character of FICTION...and that Sayuri is merely a combination of hundreds of geisha that lived in Kyoto over generations. Regardless,the book is a fascinating, uplifting, wondrous journey that I simply adore and recommend to a new person almost every day. If you have not yet discovered ""Geisha"" - do NOT waste another day. This is, quite simply, one of my all time favorite books."
4,"Great, but not without its flaws","No doubt about it, this is, by any standard, a book that excels through its sheer readability. Nothing could be more entertaining and engaging than Sayuri's struggle to survive as a geisha after being sold into slavery by her own father. We really care about this character, and that's the test of a good book. However, this book does have its problems, as others have noted. The main one seems to be an unfortunate difficulty that crops up over and over again when a male author tells a story through the viewpoint of a female protagonist. Namely, there's something fundamentally passive about Sayuri. Everything happens TO her, and everyone acts ON her. She never truly does anything except to react to what the other characters are doing. This is the same problem that marred Wally Lamb's ""She's Come Undone"" and Callie Khouri's ""Thelma and Louise"" screenplay. A passive female character does seem more appropriate in ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" but it still gets annoying."
4,It was absolutely captivating novel ; a real page turner,"Memiors of a geisha by Arthur S. Golden was an absolutely breathtaking and captivating piece.It captures you page after page in the life a geisha. The best part of the novel I would have to say is all of the detail that he puts into the piece. The detail makes you feel like you are right inside of the story and that you are not left with any questions on what is going on in the book.Also what is so captivating about the novel is that the whole story seems like a true account of a real giesha which makes you wan to read cover to cover on what will happen to her . On the whole it was beautiful piece that had suspense , passion , and wonderful detail all brought in to one great novel that once you start to read is very hard to put down ."
5,Memoirs of a Geisha-Great Read!,The author has an amazing way of describing the setting and how the characters are feeling. This book grabs you from the moment you pick it up and you are wondering throughout what will happen to Chiyo. Memoirs is amazing and should be a recommended read for all. I loved it and so will you! Happy reading!
3,where did the story go?,"I began this book with great relish. From the opening pages to about three quarters of the way through, I was completely hooked. But toward the end, it's as if the author was told he had to wrap things up in 20 pages or less! All the fine descriptions and in-depth character development give way to a rushed, abrupt, Hollywood ending that left me highly unsatisfied."
2,"Competent, Low Calorie Novel","Thin characters, thin romance. Seasoned and decorated with cultural descriptions. Written competently in the first person, a pseudo-memoir well handled keeping this reader to the end of the novel."
4,surely good stuff...,"i can tell i enjoyed this tale very much. the author did an excellent job, in making up full story and researching on japanese geisha... but the good research actually played more role than backing up the whole story, which made me bored of too much details on cultural stuffs.. sometimes the explanations have cut the flowing storyline. but generally speaking, it's surely a good book, and i recommend this book especially to who is not japanese and wants to know about japanese geisha."
2,it is too late for such a book,"To the reader of 1999 after so many books and films about geishas their is nothing new in this book. The book humiliat the women. As a literature - it is only a colaction of good sentences. The ""happy end"" is not an integral part of the plot."
2,I suppose that my hopes were too high.,"This is not a bad novel, nor a poorly written one. The author's fascination with his subject matter and his extensive research are evident. But despite these factors, I found this book to be rather middle-of the-road, and the characters uninvolving.If you truly crave meticulously researched historical fiction, I strongly suggest Gary Jennings's The Journeyer, Aztec, or (newly published in mass market) The Roadshow (Spangle). These books are all outstanding, and leave ""Memoirs"" in the dust."
3,"Very cultural and educational, but not the most entertaining","This book was an okay read. Full of culture and information, but not exactly something I found to be terrabely interesting. Written well, and organized well also."
5,Every woman should read this book!!,"Arthur Golden paints a beautifully tragic picture of Sayuri's life as a little girl who grows up to be a geisha.The reader can feel every moment along with her as she experiences triumph and sorrow in her struggles to become a successful geisha and escape the world of slavery that she is confined to. Many of the women described in Memoirs were geisha because they had to be however they were intelligent, strong, and very capable women. For this reason, I think that every woman who reads this novel should be grateful for her freedom and ability to follow her dreams instead of waiting for her destiny as Sayuri was forced to do."
4,Beautifully Written Historical Novel,"""Memoirs of a Geisha"" profiles the last gasp of an essential element of Japanese culture. Though most Americans think of ""geisha"" as synonmous with ""prostitute,"" nothing could be farther from the truth. The women who lived the life of a ""Geisha"" were well-educated and highly sophisticated, a rarity for ""average"" woman in the stifiling confines of Japan's male dominated society.The story of this real-life Geisha and her mentor is both touching and historically insightful. From her birth at the height of Geisha glory, through Japan's painful defeat in World War II, this story is a peek not only into the secret world of Geisha culture but also a look at what it means to be Japanese--something few Americans truly understand.This beautifully-written book is a joy to read!"
5,"Truly unique, captivating story","A ""memior"" written by a man which is fully feminine and wholly human."
5,Unable to dislike!,"Through the twists and turns of excitement that Memoirs of a Geisha holds, I must say that it is beyond one of the best books that I have ever read. Personally, I've never became so emotionally attached to a book; I'd often find myself crying at certain points; I'd also laugh sometimes. There are many ups and downs in life that this book couldn't explain better.Unfortunately, there was one disappointment, for me. I was hoping that she would end up with another person, but that's only because I wasn't aware of someone elses feelings -- which you'll see if you read it -- but after the book was finished, I was a little more relieved.I should tell you that this is the first book that I've read for pleasure in over eight years. I wanted the book to be longer. I wasn't okay with it ending where it did - I wanted more.I would recommend this book to anyone that's looking for: sadness, happiness, excitement, laughter, and many other things."
4,memoirs of a geisha,"This book was real page-turner. Vivid detailing of the events, the characters, their emotions, & the scenery brought the storyline to life for me very much. It was an interesting read which gave me a peek inside another culture and time period. I felt transported to another time and place as I read. Although somethings are left unexplained, there is enough detail in this novel to satisfy the mind's curiousity about this foreign world. What the reader is left with is a sense of the depth and complexity of human nature and emotion. If youre a reader who likes to learn and be entertained at the same time, this book is for you!"
5,A beautifully written story!,"I definetly recommend this novel to anyone... You can truly get inside the mind of the young geisha Chiyo Chan.. I love the novel, I read it within a week... It's very educational as well, I truly learned a lot of the Japanese Culture.. It's definetly a ""must read"""
5,Such a good book,"The book and the movie are absolutely fabulous. It's very interesting to see into another world, in a sense, to learn how others have lived their lives and the hardships that they have pushed through. I've always been really interested in the Geisha culture so to get a sort of inside look like this was really enjoyable to me. The love story, and just the interesting things that you learn from this books that you wouldn't know otherwise are reason enough to pick this book up."
5,ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT,"This book was so well written, I couldn't put it down. You follow a girl growing up in the orient through all of her experiences, however large or small. It's a somewhat sad story, but a story of hope at the same time. I'm sorry I couldn't write a better and more descriptive review. I just want to let everyone out there know that this book is well worth the time and effort."
2,"Unlikable character, writing so-so","The story was basically interesting, but the character unsympathetic. He treatment of Pumpkin (her de facto sister) and Nobu (her suitor) were abominable, but she just didn't seem to get it. I had pity for her at first, but that quickly faded. And the writing was quite lacking in imagery much of the time."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE READ IN AWHILE,THIS WAS AN UNEXPECTED & PLEASANT SURPRISE. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN AND FINISHED IT IN 2 DAYS. VERY INTERESTING & HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
5,Completely invented???..Have my doubts..!!,"Wonderful..even that does not express my real view of the book!! How astonishing..I lived the whole story as if I was a guest, that has been invited to sit and watch the whole story running like a stream of smooth running water!! Sayuri..is a women within each one of us...may seem helpless..but would do anything to get to her dream..!! She breathed, ate, and slept the way others wanted, but also kept living knowing that all comes to a rewarding end! The way it was written, made me think that no matter what I would never read such an extraordinary book written in this way.. Congradulations, in giving birth to such a magnificint piece of art...that will always be treasured and kept safe!!!"
4,Amazing,I thought this book was extremely well written. The fact that the author is a white male writing about the life of a Japanese geisha is an awe in itself! I didn't find it boring at all and read it in a span of 2 days! Anyone who hasn't read it should!!
5,A brilliant novel drawing from Japan's Geishas.,"This book offered a brilliant insight into the world of the Geisha. It portrayed the Geisha as something other than the mystical oriental doll-like creature often viewed as the Asian Prostitute. Instead, it gives the reader an opportunity to learn about the inner world of the Geisha, the training, the thoughts, the culture and history behind these women. The development of the characters, particularly the primary character from her childhood to the ultimate fantasy of being the Geisha to the Commander was a gem and I couldn't put the book down."
5,"incredible, the detail and the point of view, a must read",I had to keep flipping to the back flap to make certain that a man actually wrote this book.
4,Memoirs of a Geisha,"It is an excellent story and very hard to put down. A fast read because it is not very challenging. Although I enjoyed the book very much, I was disappointed by the ending."
5,"Not only a great story, but non-fiction as well!","This book is a fascinating account of a real geisha ""working"" in Kyoto in the 1930's. The story is very moving and very real. Sometimes I felt if I were actually there feeling and experiencing everything along with the characters."
3,Above average beach read.,"I enjoyed this book a great deal up until the ending which I found was hugely disappointing -- it was reading like a Japanese ""Gone With The Wind"" where I thought she'd end up happily after all with the Rhett figure as her danna. Instead, out of nowhere comes Ashley Wilkes...not satisfying at all and almost hurried as if the editor had told Golden to end the book.Nonetheless, I enjoyed it all until the end and would like to learn more (on a non-fictional basis) about geishas."
1,"Banal, Trite, and Overhyped--No wonder it's a best-seller!","A caveat to linguaphiles and general fans of meaningful prose: don't read it. Perhaps Mr. Golden should have spent more time learning how to write engaging text rather than trying to dredge up verisimilitude via errata. Tedious and time-consuming, this book makes Hemingway's work seem verbose. I'm sure the movie will be a runaway best-seller as well; I only hope that Mr. Spielberg takes the cardboard characters and animates them somehow. A final note to those who prefer Pynchon to Grisham: if you read it, don't say that you weren't warned!"
4,interesting,"The world of a Geisha was new to me so this book kept my attention. I'm glad it didn't go into any more detail than it did because it probably would have become boring but as it is, it was good. It didn't dwell too much on history or culture and was mostly a story of one woman and her experiences in Japan around WW2. I liked reading about the Japanese culture and how Sayuri dealt with some of the problems she faced. I think most women could probably identify with Sayuri and her feelings for the Chairman. We've all had that one man in our life whom we've never forgot how he made us feel. I recommend it."
5,Incredible work,"I read this book before the movie came out, partially because I wanted to see if the movie was worth watch. I was blown away about the author wrote this book. The details were incredible. I could literally imagin being there, walking right beside her. I could not put the book down once I started reading. Gives poeple an insight of how cultures live. And the author did a superb job gathering all the facts before he began writing the book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!"
5,Luminous and engrossing!,"Usually the snippets of acclaim on bookcovers leave me disappointed in the end. In this case the novel meets and exceeds every one of them!This book is everything those cover reviews say and more. I'd find myself thinking about Chiyo/Sayuri even when I wasn't reading the book... as if she were a real person and I was thinking about what was happening to her.I feel as if I knew this geisha, gion, and the people in her life. This novel is vibrant, exotic, touching, authentic, beautifully detailed, golden and rich. I read into it as the Chairman sees through Sayuri's eyes to her soul.Books this good come along too rarely to miss this one. I have raved too much and now you will expect the novel to be something it is not. Just let the story flow and you will be carried along like petals tossed into the Shirakawa stream."
2,Kimono fetishist,"I'm being harsh, but the constant repetition of the details of kimono and hairstyles took up a huge proportion of the books 400+ pages that could have been used to give us some insights. Why any man would be interested in the women portayed here, let alone pay forunes for their company is beyond me.... The women are not the only characters sold short; a doctor reduced to a sweat whilst treating a cut on the thigh of a 15 yr old ...please!"
2,Well-written but implausible,"Perhaps I'm jaded after living in Japan for many years, but I don't find this book as fascinating as so many others do. Why should people be so amazed that a man can actually write a woman's character?The implausibility of this well-written, but for me, finally unfulfilling book, is that no geisha would ever even think of spilling her secrets out to anyone. That's what surprises me, since the author is obviously extremely well-versed in Japanese and Japanese culture.It does not rank up there in my list with the great novels of recent memory. Read Delillo's ""Underworld"" to find masterful modern writing at its best."
3,"Gorgeous face, out of shape body!","I'm not a fan of useless verbosity unless the prose shines so brightly I wanna keep reading it. Golden shining brightly, I like the metaphor, but it just doesn't apply.In this text, bulging over at 400+ pages, Golden begins by creating a gorgeous picture of Sayuri and her life. I give him this. But the guy keeps wanting to paint -- it's like Da Vinci keeping his hands all over Mona Lisa. Why? Golden isn't even close to being a master wordsmith to begin with, and verbosity and a love affair with his own words makes the latter parts of the text even worse.Plus, the ending is simply a stab in the back to those who followed the characters throughout the pages. Golden apparently reached a point where he tired of the story, and fast-forwarded Sayuri 50 years in five pages.Memoirs isn't without merit. As I say, the beginning is drawn with flair and gives hope for an engrossing read. But trim and tone, man...Your girl has gotten flabby."
1,Corny Corny Corny,"The information was fascinating but the groaners! They kept coming and coming and coming like the waves breaking on the shores of our island, Japan. Like a hungry tiger at the edge of a herd. Like the hummingbird dipping at the nectar of a beautifully blooming flower...."
3,I wish Amy Tan wrote this instead...,"I found that the writing in this book to be lacking. The author tries to pull off some descriptions and imagery seen through the Oriental eye, but fails: there were too many cliches. He should seriously take some lessons from Amy Tan, who is truly a master of this art. I felt that the author could have included more Japanese terms to make the novel a little bit more authentic (again, Amy Tan does this so well!). Also, this novel went back and forth from being a soap opera to a documentary...this just doesn't work. The author doesn't do a good job of converting his research into fiction. It seemed like that in order to make it seem authentic, he took the research, pasted it on to paper and called it a novel. A little more editing would've been useful...Positively, I learned a lot from this research, even though it wasn't well presented. I'm looking forward to watching the movie..."
5,Best of the year!,This book had me glued from the very first page. I didn't want this book to every end. Spent a weekend doing nothing except reading this wonderful book. I recommened to anyone interested in being totaly transported into another land. Best of the year!
5,Very Good....vivid descriptions,I am not an avid book reader..but I must say I was pretty enthralled with this book....I am amazed that Mr Golden managed to capture so much of the essence of Japan as well as being a woman. I suppose this is what results when you write something truly from the heart!
2,story does'nt start until near the end of the book.,I was really disappointed by this book. After all the great reviews it recieved i expected to be entranced by the story sorry to say it was a chore to get through. The first 22 chapters seem to go nowhere only towards the end of the book does the story of the character Sayuri begin to make any progress and starts to become somewhat interesting. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
3,"Like the Geisha, It's All Illusion","With its subtle packaging and effusive critical cover blurbs, ""Memoirs"" presents itself as a lyrical, literary fable. But like its heroine, it is just a construct of pretty illusion, made only to entertain, never enlighten or challenge. The characters struck me as uninvolving and as thin as rice-paper, the so-called ""elegant"" writing as serviceable and sometimes distressingly cliched. The plot kept me turning the pages but ""suspenseful?"" Sayuri's tale was as predictable as a mediocre romance. In fact, if this novel had been packaged as a romance, I might not feel so betrayed by its lack of emotional resonance and complexity. As for Golden's attempt to capture the female voice, well, he's no Flaubert. He's not even Michener. (See Mariko in ""Shogun"" for a more three-dimensional heroine). Maybe like ""Bridges of Madison County,"" this will make a better movie than book."
4,Over-all entertaining reading - a page turner.,"I truly enjoyed reading every word of this novel. I was surprised by the complexity of the geisha culture and awe-struck by their code of conduct. My only disappointment was in the hurried final third of this woman's life story. I thought that this memoir should have elaborated more at the end, providing a more personal, complete wrap-up to her life. All-in-all, this book gives us a fascinating, easy-to-read glimpse into a totally foreign (to me, at least) world."
5,Highly recommended,"Excellent book, engaging characters. Stayed up until 2 AM to finish it! I thought this would be more of a historical study than a character study, but was pleasantly surprised."
3,Is there such a thing as a fictional autobiography?,"While a bit superficial in character development, Memoirs of a Geisha is a treasure trove of information on the ladies of entertainment of Japan's history. Though the storyline and plot may be considered dull, the book is a great primer for those unfamiliar with Eastern society. The fact that this was not in fact an autobiography serves to compell the reader to find true first hand accounts from the women who lived the life of a geisha. --This text refers to the hardcover edition of this title"
2,didn't live up to its reviews,"I agree with the writer from Chicago. The first part was interesting, but the mystique was lost when Mr. Golden became grapic in his descriptions. I too felt as if I were in a pornographic harliquin romance."
3,"Entertaining, but . . .","I enjoyed this book every bit as much as I'd hoped, but it's true that the final third does not live up to the promise of the first two-thirds. Golden has clearly done a great deal of research and has created a credible world with interesting characters, at least in a Dickensian sense. Even given it's considerable charm and entertainment value, though, it's hard not to be appalled that this will be regarded by many as an authentic representation of another culture. No matter how well researched, it's still fiction, and fiction about a tiny, highly circumscribed segment of a society. More interesting are ""The Tale of Genji"" (a tough read, though) and, especially, ""The Confessions of Lady Nijo"" (the Karen Brazell translation is, lamentably, out of print)."
3,dissapointing--and i'm only 1/4 of the way through,"to begin, the so-called translator's note annoyed me to pieces. and every time a new japanese term was introduced the author felt compelled to give a LESSON on it. gimme a break! quit showing off your education, put it in a glossary in the back of the book and GET ON WITH THE STORY!!! (true, i didn't know what a lot of these terms meant but i felt talked down to). lengthy descriptions of kimono patterns seemed to me a waste of time and not at all interestingly written enough for me to care. to top it off the story line so far has been very cliche. i'm so glad my copy is borrowed.i'm hooked though."
4,Incredibly moving...,"A wonderfully moving, descriptive and sensusous work of fiction about a young girl's struggle through life. Although, I do feel that the ending was too erupt and without any real depth...could have been explored further or perhaps changed...too trite. Nevertheless, it was one a few novel that I simply could not tear myself away from...truly exceptional...a great novel to escape from reality...You have to read it with an open mind..."
4,Excellent Read and discussion book,"I am amazed at how fast I sympathized with and wanted to know about Sayuri, the heroine. Normally a book takes pages to build identifictation with the hero, but not here. This is all the more amamzing considering that she is a young girl (I am a 30 something man) and from a culture I know little about. This early interest in her life is not disappointed as the book continues. In fact 20 pages from the end, I am still curious. Well written and a fast read and well worth discussing with friends."
4,Whats wrong with fairy tales anyway?,"The life and times of a little girl who would become a celebrated geisha in post WW11 Japan. A fairy tale of a read; complete with the required cast of characters, a life full of challenges and the girl gets her guy kind of happy ending. Sap that I am I enjoyed every minute spent between this book's covers. The author paints beautifully detailed pictures of an almost secret society with his words, the characters are so fully described their motivations are easily understood and it has to end somehow so why not happy! The fact that Mr. Golden seems to be in such easy communication with his feminine side both startles and intrigues me."
5,A memior with an impact,"Memiors of a Geisha is a highly outstanding book, combining historical facts, and a graceful writing style. Reading this book, I was amazed throughout the entire process that an American male author could imatate the feelings and thoughts of a Japanese female, starting from childhood and stopping with death so well. While reading this book, Golden creates such a vivid scenery for you, right in Japan, and with each further reading you grow fonder of the main character Sayuri. Reading this book is like stepping inside the life of a child, and being able to watch it grow, to everything you hoped it would turn out to be, and more."
4,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Wow, while reading memoirs of a Geisha, I can really appreciate the grace and beauty and skill and patience it takes to become a Geisha....poor Sayuri all those years of being a maid! and all that trouble from Hatsumomo.....I have a new respect for these women because during the time the novel takes place...women did'nt have a lot of choices....I am almost finished with the book."
2,YAWN,"Seeing this book week after week on the best sellers' lists I thought it would be worth a good read. Well, it started off fine enough but I was bored by the end. Her character never rang true to life for me. She gave the same bad treatment back to people that she had received from some. The ending was trite. I think Mr. Golden didn't know how to end this story so he just wrapped up loose ends. My bookclub read this book this month. Glad I wasn't the one that recommended it. This could have been a truly grand novel. Too bad."
1,The Metaphor Factory must have run double shifts to keep up,"with Golden's demand for Metaphors with Extra Velveeta. Memoirs does not have one redeeming quality. Cartoonish characters; trite plot, tedious dialogue; contrived ending. It took Golden over 400 insufferable pages just to say that Cinderella-san lived happily ever after. I feel like a reader adrfit in a salty sea of really bad writing. (Mr. Golden, PLEASE don't use my metaphor in your next book!)"
5,Great book,I read this book when it first came out and loved it. I just finished reading it again. It is a wonderful book. Definetley one of my favorites.
5,Speedo Rocks!,"I have been wearing the solar speedo for years. It fits perfectly with the center and rear seam. As a fitness trainer, I have my corporate logo put on them as well. Having a built body, with a suit designed for a man who should be wearing a speedo only helps to boost my business. I would recommend this Speedo to any man who wants comfort on the beach, or competitive swimming in a pool. The look is great, the look is confidence. START WEARING THEM!"
3,Goes through batteries,I've only had this radio for a few months and I only use it in the morning to listen to the radio while I am waking up so far I have had to replace the batteries in those two month. Then I was on vacation for two months and it sat with no use and the batteries were already dead. Make sure you have the batteries in good because the clock showed up but I couldn't get the radio to work. I removed the batteries and put them back in an then the radio worked.
2,Limited Use,"I bought this as a travel clock radio. However, when you go to bed at night you cannot have the radio on if you wish to set the alarm! It has one sliding switch which operates both the radio and alarm. While the radio works okay for such a small item and the alarm seems dependable, it is not that useful if you cannot use both together."
1,Lousy sound,"It's too late to return, but I'm thinking about throwing away. Sound is really tinny and bad. Buy something else."
4,surprisingly good little radio and clock,"The radio obviously has no low end, but is crisp, clear, and loud. Pulls in many stations, sharply, on AM and FM, and tuning doesn't backlash on you. Slips into a shirt pocket. The open-lid/reset-radio/snooze/LED light button is really clever. Very easy to set. This is a great rig for waking to news or music on travel. I notice some others had trouble. This one's OK. I'd say..give it a good testing right away when you get it. If it works you will be pleased going forward."
1,Piece of crap,"Being a bit of an old fart, I grew up trusting the brand name Timex--inexpensive, no frills, and reliable. No more. I've had this clock less than six months and it can no longer be read -- the numerals have turned to gibberish. Fresh batteries made no difference, nor did shutting it off and restarting, nor did slamming it against the table top. Piece of crap."
2,half an order,In an effort to learn the Persian language I ordered this course because it came with a CD to help with pronounciation of this difficult but beautiful language. It did not include the necessary CD. This makes the book sent only half a help since it continually refers to the audio CD for lessons. Therefore I rate it at 2 1/2stars. I would not purchase from this publisher again with trust.
2,"Poor, I don't recommend this textbook","I have used poor textbooks before, so it's sort of okey for me. I have to use other resources to find the correct pronunciation but not everyone is resourceful or would be happy to search the pronunciation of many words, which may not even have complete vocalisation symbols, let alone romanisation. Besides, as other reviewers pointed out, there are problems with material used in exercises, which was not previously explained.Perhaps it's good for learners who like extra stress."
4,Lovely,"What you have is lovely and amazing. Sometime, some poeople do not see it or maybe too busy to realize it. This movie made me feel that I do have something lovely and amazing in my life."
2,wandering,"This was a pretty pointless movie. The acting was more often than not needy and flat. Catherine Keener seemed totally out of place, as if she was trying too hard to be energetic and zany. The movie ended just as the plot was getting interesting. After finishing it, I couldn't figure out what the point of it was and why I had even bothered to watch it."
3,Doesn't Quite Live Up To Its Potential,"""Lovely and Amazing"" is an interesting, well-acted film about family and relationships, and the struggles of the individuals in them. I enjoyed it, yet found it a bit unfocused. In the end, it didn't seem quite as cohesive as it should have been. A bit fragmentary, perhaps. I'm not sorry I saw it, and I appreciated the performances of Catherine Keener (always a pleasure), Emily Mortimer, Brenda Blethyn, and Raven Goodwin. The writer and director Nicole Holofcener has talent and I look forward to her next project. I just felt like ""Lovely and Amazing"" could've been a bit better."
4,R.A. The Rugged Man,"I like the vibes that RA The Rugged Man has. A real grimey sound. Im feelin the production also. He has a pretty ILL voice at that so im feelin it, im feelin his lyrics. He aint all for that ""fame"" bull so thats on a good status. He doesnt give anything about all that MTV and BET wackness. Im feelin all the lyrics all the beats thats all I gotta say hands down. I recommend this album to ALL hiphop heads no doubt. This guy gots some good lines. Check it out no doubt.My Top 5 Songs1.Lessons2.Casanova3.Chains4.How Low5.Midnight Thud"
4,Great Buy For The Price!!,I have to say you get what you payed for. Most people say that you have to wear a backwards hat or else the mask will fall off. I disagree. With the ajustable strap on the back I was able to fit it to my head. Another person said that the mask was watery like a winshield and I aslo disagree. The mask is a little watery looking towards the bottom of the lens but works great. I tested the lens with my airsoft desert eagle which is powerful knowing it goes through cardboard easily. The lens didn't crack or break and only left a little mark from the bb which came off easily. The mask has some defects of stuff falling out or breaking but overall I highly reccomend this mask for the price. So what are you waiting for? GO BUY ONE NOW!
1,Terrible quality,We received the head protection gear and it was already half falling apart. the pieces were not put together and the foam was losely fitting and falling off. The snap on part of the mask had broken pieces so it could not snap on or had already broken off. The only good aspect is Amazon's return policy. My 10 year son was very upset he could not play withthe other kids when the face mask came in.Thank you Amazon for getting his money back.
2,You get what you pay for....,"My brother, sister, and I wanted to buy some masks for airsoft, and really didn't want to spend too much, so we decided to go with these. All we really wanted them for was playing in our back yard, so quality wasn't too big an issue. The items shipped in standard time, and arrived in fair condition. The visor on one had pulled apart, but it was an easy fix. The mask is extremely flexible, so any hard shots aren't going to just bounce off. The visor is flimsy, and like I said, it does come apart rather easily. The worst part about it though is the goggles. They are wavy, hard to see through, and make depth perception very difficult. All in all, they are really cheap masks, which is what I expected when I only paid $13 for them. If I was planning on using them for competition, I'd probably send them back, but since we're only fooling around in the yard, I think they'll work out fine."
3,darth vader,the mask is very good the problem with it is u cant aim correctly through a rifle or iron sights but the worse part was it made me look like a dumb version of darthvader i would say get another mask
5,Reassuring guide to bearing and raising twins.,"As an expectant mother of twins, I have read several books on the subject of twins pregnancy and raising twins. I have found this book to be one of the most straightforward and reassuring books that I have read. Other books I read made me feel overwhelmed, as if I am not up to the task. This book has had a very calming effect on me, because of its practical and non-judemental advice. The quotes from parents of twins throughout the book are revealing and helpful as well. Because the authors are from the UK, some of the quotes will sound funny to Americans, such as the one from a woman who said that she drank plenty of Guinness to help her regain her strength after her babies were born."
5,"An enchanting read, despite the hardship portrayed.","One of the loveliest contemporary novels I've ever read, full of mood and history and sensitivity. This author deserves far more attention than she has received; she can write circles around most of the authors out there, combining poetry, narrative, and a touch of magic. I am eagerly awaiting her next novel"
2,fizzled out,"My first novel by this writer might not have been her best whodunit. I enjoyed her writing and her character Inspector Wexford. Even though this book imploded half way in for this reader, I plan to check out another read from Rendell some time in the future. This one just fizzled out for me."
5,Must have in any kitchen.,These are great and have been a staple in my kitchen for years. A must have for all kitchens. I have given as gifts. Perfect for a gift basket.
4,They are nylon pan-scrapers. What can go wrong?,"The one thing that would make these better would be just a tiny bit of flexibility. They're quite rigid, so they don't flex at all to follow small variations in the contours of whatever you're scraping. But the grips are quite nice."
5,Mary Pope Osborne's insightful look into Shakespeare's Time,"Once again Mary Pope Osborne delights her readers as she offers them a spectacular trip back in time to the Elizabethean Age and Shakespeare's theater. As Osborne lures readers in with her captivating tales, the illustrations by Sal Murdocca add to the book by showing readers what ""Olde England"" looked like. Stage Fright on a Summer Night gives vaulable historical data, while allowing Jack and Annie to experience the stage life and a personal encounter with Will Shakespeare. This book provides a great introduction for young readers to Shakespeare's plays and to common problems experienced by young actors. This Osborne book reminds me of King of Shadows by Susan Cooper, but Osborne focuses on a younger audience and shows us that youngsters,too deserve to know about one of the greatest writers ever known."
5,Geneva's review stage fright on a friday night,Stage fright on a friday night is about these two charactors and thay go on a Adventure to a place where thay find that there in a play but thay get scared witch is called stage fright thene thay try to be calm but thay cant .
3,Getting America Right,"I was a little disappointed with the overall message. While I agree there should be more personal accountability, the authors never once mentioned the role big business plays in the overall economy, other than to say free reign will spur growth. The problem, of course, is that free reign and lower business taxes have been happening for some time now, but the alleged accompanying growth is non-existent. Kinda shoots that theory into the crapper."
2,not the best from this author,"I have read many of Lavryle Spencer's books and this is the first time I have really been disappointed. The story starts out great but then just moves too slow, and like the other reader mentioned, Clay and Catherine just can't seem to get around their problems and grow up. And so much of the book focused on her problems instead of the growing attraction between the two characters, which is usually what you get from Lavyrle Spencer novels. Definitely not worth the time I spent on it."
1,"I wanted to like this book, but couldn't","I've enjoyed all the other Lavyrle Spencer books that I've read, but this one just frustrated and annoyed me.Spoiler alert.Throughout the book Catherine is stubborn about resisting love. This goes on for 320 pages out of the 340 page book. Immediately after Clay gives up, she does a 180 within a page or two and suddenly is open to being loved. But it's still not good enough, and Clay has to continue to do all the work. The author does give her reasons for what she does, but let's be honest: just because someone had a traumatic childhood, that doesn't mean you really want to be around them. THis was like spending WAY too much time with a whiner and a bore. I just spent the whole time feeling sorry for Clay; he deserved better than her."
3,Hasn't stood the test of time.,"I remember reading and really enjoying this book many years ago and was looking forward to re-reading it when I recently came across a copy. This time around the story didn't work for me, and I think it's because the premise - young adults have single night of passion, are forced to marry, live together celibately and eventually discover that they are in love - doesn't ring true for today's audience. Other authors have made this work in more recent books, for example Susan Elizabeth Phillips, but it's just too simplistic here. Spencer is a very accomplished writer and I continue to enjoy many of her books, but this one hasn't stood the test of time. However, I do think that it might appeal more to younger readers who are just discovering romance novels."
1,Way too unrealistic for this time and day,"I was very disappointed in this book. I've never read a book by this author before and probably never will again. First off, a pregnant woman would NEVER (in real life) be doing all that drinking of alcohol while pregnant. 2nd, Clay has to be the most selfish person I'd ever read about. Seems he's not very interested in his daughter even toward the very end of the book. 3rd, What's with his parents anyway? Grandparents don't just go away because a couple separate. Why didn't they attempt to even visit Melissa? Way too unrealistic for me and a total disregard for the realistic facts when pregnant."
5,Bring on Season Two !,"I give Fall Guy 5 stars all the way. Being a child of the 70's and 80's, I grew up on this series. My hats off to Glen Larson for another fantastic creation. He and Stephen J.Cannell and the ""tops"". Michael Mann is right up there as well. If you see the above three names on a tv series, you owe it to yourself to check them out. I hope Season two for Fall Guy is soon to be released. The tv series written by any of the above guys blows the socks off of junk on Prime time tv today. We have had enough of reality tv.. Bring back the detective shows of the 70's and 80's..."
1,Full Season is only 5/6 of a season!!,"While I'm a big fan of the series, upon receipt of the 6 disc season 1 package I found it contained 2 copies of disc #4, and no disc #6. Put a call into Amazon and received another set of discs the next day (kudos to Amazon). Sadly, the same issue; 2 copies of disc #4 and no disc #6. I've tried to contact fox...good luck with that one. At this point all I can say is, for the price fox is trying to charge, you should get at least a full season...not 5/6 of a season. This is a real disappointment."
5,when tv was really cool,"the fall guy, was one of the last cool tv shows, before reality tv, became the norm. great pacing, writing etc.. oh did i mention lee majors was the star of the show. one of the all time great tv actors"
4,TAKE NOTE: this is the stuff you're lookin' for,"Electroclash? More like electrocrap! If you wanna fall for that retro -->garbage<--, be my guest, but this is where it's really at, my friends. Viki is absolutely awesome on this record... her painful beats and circuit-bent toys are on fire! The Hair Police are pretty good, too, but nowhere near as manic. The Viki half is worth the price, though. BUY THIS."
1,Disc does not work,Rumor is there are problems with the BluRay version. It won't play on many BluRay players. This is the first BluRay out of many that has not played on my HP laptop. It pissed me off as I was anticpating watching this thing all day. In the end I watched some episodes of the British show 'Shameless' which was pretty damn entertaining. I will be sending this BluRay back and just suffer through the DVD version.
1,Avoid at all costs!!!,"This is, without-a-doubt, one of the worst movies produced in the last 10 years. Honestly, a 9-year-old could have wrote a better plot and better dialogue. This movie's plot has more holes than a battlefield after a bombing run and the production value is abysmal. The special effects look like they came out of the 80's. As a comic-book film, this movie is awful. As a general film, this movie is STILL awful. Seriously, I have never met a person in the real world who actually liked this piece of trash."
2,Aspect Ratio 2:35 is Horrible,"There are few things I hate than popping in a DVD and watching a two-hour movie go by while trying to watch it with two huge black bands on the top and bottom. Okay, maybe it's too much to hope for full screen versions of movies, but how about a more realistic ratio, like 16:9, where you can see what's going on? People with high definition are going to be ordering in in Blu-Ray, and converting the movie to one's MP4 player is a waste of effort (if the movie was worth the effort in the first place).In short, either produce the movie in full screen edition or at least have it available in both. Or just use a 16:9 for everything.They can keep their product. I'll rent it if I feel like watching it."
2,Not what I expected,"I was excited to see Wolverine Origins but as the movie went on I thought to myself another comic book movie that doesn't stick to itz origins.I mean you don't exactly have to follow the comic word for word, but atleast stay close to it, they put characters in the movie that didn't match up with the timeline in Wolverine's comics. And i do agree that the other 3 X-Men movies were good but they too didn't really follow the comic story. Cyclops was a weak leader, I think Halle Berry wasn't a good choice for Storm bad accent too. I know Wolverine is the most exciting character in X-Men but the other characters also have alot to bring to the team. I hope they remake the X-Men with the original 5 Iceman,Jean Grey,Cyclops, Beast, and Angel. And then gradually bring in other X-Men characters. All these comic movies need to stick to the comics in some form or manner. I know movie producers and writers try to be creative but damn there are somethings you shouldn't mess with.'"
4,Good movie,"It's been a while since I've seen it in the movie theater. For a heads up to X-men aficionados, this Origins follows the Ultimate X-men story arc, instead of another. So some details do not go with the original explanations."
5,Cool movie!,"Very good movie, special effects are excellent. I have never seen any x-men movies before this and this was exceptional."
3,decent movie,as many of the die hard x-men fans have seen this movie isn't up to par to the comics but still a decent watch
4,Very Cool and Exciting,"It was really cool to see some of the characters from this universe 'before' they became X-Men or weapons or Brotherhood. Wolverine's origin was dramatic and intense and filled with emotional highs and lows. They went all the way back to his childhood which was fascinating. It wasn't just about Wolverine the X-man. It was about him as a child, a brother, a son, a mutant, a warrior, a husband. The only disappointment was Taylor Kitsch as Gambit. His acting was kind of wooden and stiff- and his accent was horrible- It was the worst cajun/orleans accent I've ever heard. I really like Taylor Kitsch and I was looking forward to him being in this movie- but the accent was horrible and the acting talent was lacking when compared to the actors he shared the screen with. Other than that one disappointment- the movie was much more and better than I thought it would be. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It's a keeper."
4,I do like Wolverine and the X-Men.,This is a good movie. At least the next movie won't have to deal with the origin story that we all know. Hugh Jackman can do no wrong playing Wolverine.
5,Xmen wolverine,"The movie had great visual effects.It kept your interest throughout. What else can I say, but in my opinion an excellant adventure movie."
2,Don't know the quaility of the blu-ray but the movie sucked.,"Unless Ur a collector and have to have all the xmen movies don't bother with this one. Why has fox taken marvels fiercest super mutant and turned him into a whiny wuss? All about the $$$$$$ cause it sure as hell aint about the story! I really enjoy deadpool as a character too bad he isn't in this movie but they keep calling this other guy his name hmmm weird. Really honestly people avoid this train wreck its poorly done not very entertaining and really a slap in the face of the 1st 2 xmen movies ( we wont mention a certain part of this Trilogy) Save Ur money for Star trek or if u haven't bought it pick up the far far superior Watchmen don't let fox shovel us this pig swill, or wolverine swill if u will."
2,Let Down,"I was expecting more from this movie. Something like the way the 1st X-Men movie started, or how well done the second movie was. I'm glad I rented instead of buying. It started out ok and there were nice references to the other movies, but over all it turned into just another cheesy super hero movie. I can't count the amount of times the claws were shown for no reason. It just became so lame.So anyway I suggest renting it, if you like it you like it, if not..."
3,Spectacular special effects & actions + Hugh Jackman's appearance & acting is gripping + A little bit of character developments,"- Spectacular special effects and action scenes.- Hugh Jackman's appearance and acting is gripping. I believe he's one of the main reasons why people watched this movie.- As for character developments, there was a little bit but not enough to make it a meaningful movie. For example the love between Wolverine and his wife (Lynn Collins) is only briefly depicted. The relationship between Wolverine and his brother (played by Live Schreiber) shows good contrast and conflict. It gives me something to think about. It makes the movie a little deeper than it looks. Live Schreiber is convincing and looks scary as the main villain.- In short, this film is absolutely worth watching"
3,this movie was ok but not what i expected,it could have been better... way better. it doesnt really do a good job of explaining actually everything about wolverine. sometimes it does make things connect with the first movie well but it still leaves you wondering so many things like how is it wolverine never aged anymore after the way he looks now. i mean he was born like hundreds of years ago. the story isnt bad it just isnt complete to me. the action is not bad but to me it was subpar... maybe i need to watch it a few more times and review it again... lmao
3,More like 3 1/2 stars,"Logan Hugh Jackman) and his brother Victor (Live Schreiber), long-lived mutants with amazing powers of healing, go from close siblings to deadly enemies, eventually facing off in a huge battle that involves lots of other mutants as well.A lot of people hate this movie, but I thought it was pretty good. Jackman remains the perfect embodiment of Wolverine and Schreiber makes a scary Sabretooth. It covers a lot of ground and none of it is great filmmaking, but it provides a lively and entertaining history for the character and has plenty of good action scenes. There's a nice tie-in to the first X-Men film with a surprise cameo at the end."
4,4.5 stars for this tragic movie,misunderstandings can be deadly.. So it is in this fine Mexican film about a group of workers who are mistaken for communist students and brutalized by a crazed town of religous fanatics headed by a hypocritical priest and mayor... I had never heard of this movie but the picture on the front of the dvd really captured my attention and the reasonable price tag made it worth taking a chance... I'm glad I did.. this is a very relevant movie that more people should watch.
1,Fingers got stuck in toy,Bought this for my daughter who has down syndrome and autism. Had to take the toy away because when she opens and closes the toy she gets her fingers stuck. Screams!!!
5,Wonderful toy!,my one year old loves this toy! It is durable and fun to play with. A great addition to his building blocks games!
4,Bought as gift,"I bought this Joyce Chen Chinese Kitchen Knife (clever) after owning one for the past 11 years as a wedding gift. Over the years I have used the one I own for everything from slicing tomatoes to separating rib steaks. I know it is not recommeded for bone cutting/breaking but it has worked well and resharpened well. I am very satisfied with the one I own. The only downside is with the wooden handle, like all wood it takes some extra care. If you let it dry out it will crack but with a little TLC and mineral oil it is okay."
1,hollow ground,"This is a hollow ground blade (not flat ground) which does not cut straight. The blade tends to want to rotate in the cut because of this. Get a knife with a flat ground blade, not this one. You can see the ground part at the bottom of the blade. It is a cheaper way to make knives."
1,not an all star,"Not a practical guide in this collecting age. Does NOT have a comprehensive list; meaning it does NOT cover all manufacturers and, more importantly, for the ones it does, only provides listings of the base set. That means no insert or variation pricing whatsoever. Also, no oddball or minor league issues are listed. Generally speaking, unless you are collecting base sets prior to the advent of inserts and alternate versions of the base set, this guide is fairly useless."
3,Maybe NOT a female Eminem,"I have only heard ""Ladiez"" and ""Pack Ya Bags,"" and while i like both songs, they are not at all comparable to Eminem. Just because she is WHITE doesn't make her like Eminem. I haven't heard the rest of the album, but from what I have heard, her songs sound like ones you would dance to...which is cool, but you don't dance to Eminem's songs!!!"
2,Heard few worse!,"After listening to this album from a friend, out of shear curiosity and amusement, I have very few positive things to say. I appreciate the effort, and Sarai's voice talents, but the beats and flow is rediculous. The cookie-cutter sound of the music production and the meaningless lyrics make this CD a definite ""don't bother."""
2,what is she thinking?,"man what is she thinking doin an album? she has some talent with rappin, but none to make a WHOLE cd the only real decent song is ladies and even that gets annoying with the chorus because it gets stuck in ur head and that sucks because she rhymes so fast, u cant hear what she is sayin so ur sayin ""ladies hands up lemme see u shake ur stuff, abc and d cups jfhsafajsdfhjsadb fellas hands high.....!!!!! it so sucks kuz then ur friends ask what u said and ur like i have no clue!!!! its not that shes white because i thought she was black when i heard her ""ladies"" song its juz her songs have no meaning to em! when i heard people calling her feminem after i got the cd (which was today haha) i laughed so hard i couldnt stop because she is far from being eminem at least em's songs got meaning to them and can actually move you!!!!!! this is gonna sound so dumb but i knew that ladies was gonna be a one hit wonder so i borrowed it from the library!!!"
1,wack,"reppin kingston, ny to the fullest! haha....another load of crap released from the bowels of the midhudson valley."
3,Not what I expected!,"This is a soft bristle broom definitely for indoor use. I attempted to use this outside for heavier sweeping but because the wiskbroom feature screws onto the handle it spins when sweeping if not screwed on tightly. I bought this broom to replace an excellent one I bought several years ago but can't find it's manufacturer. The broom I'm trying to replace has a positive snap on wiskbroom, will not spin when sweeping and strong bristles."
5,No Problems,"Ordered the ram, and installed it in my desktop PC. Arrived in good time, and well packaged, against shipping damage. Worked great, and helped run some of my programs better for sure, until my desktop died a week later. Did not attempt to recessitate my desktop-used its demise as an excuse to buy a better, more updated PC(anything would have been better, and more updated). Happy with my new PC. Dunno what to do with my dead one with the new ram in it lol! Oh well..."
5,Kingston Value Ram from Amazon,"This Ram chip was purchased to replace memory in a customers computer. This Kingston Non Ecc memory worked exactly as it should in that particular computer. I have had memory that worked in one computer, and not another one. Kingston has always worked for me. The price is very reasonable. I would recommend to anyone."
2,no glue,"There was prompt delivery of this product, but as soon as I began to read it the pages fell out one by one. It is now in an usuable condition after only a few weeks of ownership."
5,"very good, but should be read slowly","Some proofs are somewhat abstract to the beginner. Although you are forced to check them on the paper, I think it is very good for the study. Also, you need a professor to instruct you, because in math, any language could only express the part of the oringins. Anyway, algebraic geometry is the course that you have to have a good professor to help you, otherwise stop study this field. In one word, it is a very very good book, so read it slowly!!!!!!"
4,Sounds AWESOME!,"Look, ididnt read the book YET but im a fan of all 3 movies and want to get the book BADLY. I think it is very cool toput together those 3 movies and i cannot wait to read it"
4,Excellent but different !!,"This is another great Out Of Eden Album,this is myfifth album that I have bought from them.There vocals and harmonies are even more awesome onthis album especially on songs IMMORTAL,INVISIBLE,GOD ONLY WISE and HAVE MERCY which is the mostbeautifullist song I have heard in a long time.Thisis another must have for any OUT OF EDEN fan.GOD BLESS,"
4,Every husband should be so lucky,"I thought that Letters to Karen was a very insightful and highly enjoyable book. It captured my interest from the beginning and I found myself looking forward to the contents of the next letter. This book consists of a father's letters to his daughter per her request on how to keep her husband loving her forever. Charles Shedd, Karen's father is a pastor, counselor and has a vast knowledge of failed and successful relationships. He covers everything from sex, to communication, to cooking, all so very objectively and with God as the sole motivation behind his theories. Karen's father is a very learned and qualified man for the task given to him by his daughter, and this book would be very beneficial for any prospective or seasoned wife."
4,Decent story; incorrect details,"While the plot of ""Walker, Texas Ranger: The Novel"" is good, it seems that Mr. Reasoner would do well to watch the show a little more closeley. For example: 1)C. D. owns ""C. D.'s Bar & Grill"", not ""C. D.'s Place""; 2)Past episodes have shown that Ranger Trivette has GREAT DIFFICULTY in riding a horse (an admirable acting job by Clarence Gilyard, whose biography indicates rodeo experience); 3)Likewise, Trivette had to learn to drive an 18-wheeler in one episode; and 4)Ranger Walker talks less on the show than he does in the book.These are some of the things that caught my attention. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed the book, and I hope Mr. Reasoner writes another one soon. (I'd just like to see things a little closer to the show's portrayals.)"
4,Surprisingly superb,"Since I already got Brazilectro & Asia Lounge from Audiopharm, I just missed this cd. As with the other cd's from audiopharm, this cd is just great, listen to the music when the sun is shining, take a cocktail and just dance! Great tunes was what I expected...and it just tasted surprisingly superb, so... Advise? Just buy it & check it out!"
2,Hawaiian flag,The flag was relatively expensive yet made out of cheap material. It frayed in the wind on the first day I used it.
4,Good looking flag,"This flag is very well made for the price. You can't go wrong on this one. Especially if you intend to hang it on the wall indoors, however, it may be a little flimsy for extended outdoor use."
2,"Nice material, but poorly printed","The quality of the flag is fine -- a thin but silkier fabric, drapes nicely. But when I opened the package, there were two LARGE pink smudges in the white fields of the flag. I don't know if it's a printing error or improper handling or what, but I'm very disappointed. Inexpensive shouldn't automatically mean poor quality."
3,Too much info,"Very in-depth to be of interest to most people. Quite big and bulky too so probably not something you would carry on such a trip. This is not a guide in the 'lonely planet sense' but rather a very well researched guide to the history,folklore and architecture etc but there is not much in the way of practicalities like maps and camping info etc. Then again it doesn't claim to be so my mistake in purchasing."
3,Don't take this to Santiago,"This book provides a lot of information about the art and culture to be found along the Camino, but it is a totally unpractical guide for those actually walking the 750km to Santiago. First of all it is simply too heavy and bulky to lug around an entire country. Secondly it provides no information on refuges, routes, places to eat, etc. Thirdly the authors frequently recommend staying multiple days at the larger cities, which can be very hard for credencial-carrying pilgrims since most refuges have a one night maximum stay. If you are rich and can afford to rent a car, stay in hotels, and take a couple of months off from work, this is the guide to carry. If you want a more genuine experience I suggest leaving this book at home and picking up one of the many more useful guides upon arrival in Spain."
4,Very helpful book,"I just got started using Reporting Services and was completely lost using the BOL. This book really helped me understand how to get started and to write some more advanced reports. Some of the screen pictures were a little out of date (apparently taken from the beta version) but this was not a big deal. The errata info at the Wrox forums was also very helpful and I was able to get answers from the authors on the P2P forum. In all, I'm happy I bought the book. Good job."
3,Good book despite technical inaccuracies and typos,"I like Wrox books in general and this book has helped me learned SQL Reporting Services (I had no prior knowledge of SRS). I did find some errors in their examples that wasted valuable time for me. MAKE SURE you check out Wrox's errata page for this book before working through the examples: [...]. The numerous typos detract from the professional feel of the book. Until a second edition comes out you may want to consider ""Hitchhiker's Guide to SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services""."
1,waste of money,"I have never wrote a review online here at amazon, but this book was such a disappointment that i decided to tell people about it. Basically this is an extension of ""The Rational Guide to: SQL Server Reporting Services"" by Anthony T. Mann, book with lots of screen shots. It does have a few simple excersises but thats about it. For example on pages 80-81 of the book in the grooping section it reads: ""Tabular or matrix data may be sorted and grouped on one or multiple levels"" then there is a nice screen shot of grouped design, it does not tell you how to do it. Then a few paragraphs later after the another screen shot it reads: ""In this design for this report, there are four list controls placed inside one another. Grouping have been created for each of the lists to organize them into hierarchy"" It says nothing about designing such a thing. Basically the book lacks hands on excersises. I found it totally useless."
2,"The title should be ""How to Frustrate Readers""",The amount of errors in this book is pathetic... obviously the pressures of publishing early is as great as the pressure to release software before it's ready.
5,Another fine Brazilian MPB album,"This is one of several records by Brazilian artist Chico Buarque that have the same title (""Chico Buarque""). This one is from 1978, and is quite good."
3,"It's not about hacking, it's about tweaking Windows XP","I grabbed this book because I thought it might be about, well, hacking. (Well okay, that and the fact that it was cheap). As a professional hacker I can assure you that there is nothing about hacking in here. (In fact, there are a few suggestions, such as making user accounts with no passwords, that made me cringe). Most of the information in here is available in other places, and could be found relatively quickly with google if you knew what it was you were looking for. Most average users though don't know what they're looking for and therefore having a book which tells them that they can change their logon screen, startup screen, disable timestamps, and turn off unneeded services is useful. If you're a power user or sysadmin this book is a waste of your time. If you're a casual home user that just wants to have more control over your OS environment, this book is probably a good fit."
3,hacking xp,Book's table contents and actual pages did not match. But other than that the book had good info on the resource hog xp can become and how to trim it down.
3,Always Run Fan On Low,"One thing I learned the hard way (I own 2 of these units and I'm ordering a 3rd), is ALWAYS RUN THE FAN ON LOW. If you attempt to run the fan on high or medium for any length of time, something (the bearings? the motor housing?) gets loose in the unit and begins to make a low rattling noise. If you keep the fan on low all the time, the unit will remain quiet for quite some time. I guess the motor shakes something loose in the unit when it is run too long on high or medium. The rattle will probably too loud to use in a bedroom at night when you are trying to go to sleep. Also, the plastic runners on the back of the unit for use when the unit is vertical sometimes come off and you will have to superglue them back on."
3,Air purifier,"The Honeywell desktop HEPA air purifiere is a nice size, and is good for a single room. It is noisey and if ran on high you can not hear yourself think."
2,Motor failing before filter replacement.,"OK, the price is good, but I have had this filter on my desk for 18 months, and the motor is failing. It starts slowly and sometimes slows way down, and it is clear that the bearings are failing.Now, if this were the first Honeywell filter this has happened with I might not be writing such a bad review, but seriously, about fifty cents more would get motors with bearings that will last years - why the cheap bearings, Honeywell?"
4,honeywell and amazon go well together,hepa purifier preforms as advertised was easy to set up except the filter was a little difficult to insert for someone slightly uncoordinated like me--husband had no problem and it performs beautifully this purifier was a good value and performs well
2,noisy companion,"This unit does clean the air and is quite efficient at removing odors, but it is so noisy that it is a relief to unplug it and put it back in its box to return it."
3,works well but noisy,"This unit is small enough to fit on our large window sills. It uses a real HEPA filter, and thus works well to clean out dust and smaller particles such as pollen and larger microbes (most virus are <1mu). I bought 3 of these to filter air in bedrooms. However, that does not work well because they are VERY NOISY. They sound similar to a standard kitchen fan, even on the lowest setting. So, because they do filter the air like a 4-5 star unit, but with noise level at 1 star, they average 3 stars overall. One of the units also developed a rattle, which could be remedied by some foam pressed in between the front and main box. The larger (not to be put in a window sill) Electrolux units are 5 star overall (filtering 5, noise 5, looks 5, value 5); buy that one if you don't mind a floor unit."
2,Not really that comfy,"I bought two of these sheets before discovering the jersey knit and I have to say these are not really soft at all. In my opinion they are scratchy and uncomfortable. I will say that they fit the mattress well which is very important. However, I'm not really fond of the reinforced elastic corners. I like sheets that have elastic all the way around the sheet. It makes for a snugger fit. If I were you I'd go with the Koala jersey knit sheets. They are in the same price range, are MUCH softer, and have elastic all the way around the sheet."
5,Valuable and fascinating background on Alamo heroes.,"An endlessly fascinating account of the lives of Travis, Bowie, and Crockett, the three most familiar names from among all the Alamo heroes. Meticulous research shows the dark side as well as the heroic side of their characters,and one is struck by the impression of an inexorable force drawing these three disparate personalities from widely separate backgrounds to stand together and take their place in history. A ""must read"" for anyone interested in how Texas got that way. (Warning for Sam Houston devotees: be prepared to deal with a distinctly unflattering impression of this Texas icon.)"
4,The most awesome action game,This is the best game i ever seen. Much better than 007. I think all the people mus play this game.
2,sunterra 337106 prefilter box,"Not really happy with this pre filter box, I have another one that the top just snaps on into place, this one has 4 phillips skrews , 1 in each corner to hold the filter media and top piece of plastic, down, just a pain I'm thinking, rather than snapping the lid off to rinse the media I have to take tools with me now...like my other brand one much better. Oh and this one came with no filter media, the other had 12 bio balls, and it was 13.00. I actually thought I was buying the same thing, but it wasn't...oh well, already in the pond, just going to take extra time when I need to rinse the media every couple weeks.I used half the bioballs from my other pre filter box in the compartment in bottom where the pump sits, gives the bacteria somewhere to hold onto and colonize."
5,Great Show - Just like I expected (Amazon Purchase),I love Top Chef and knew I would like Top Chef Just Desserts. I did. The challenges were creative and great. There was one competitor that had a problem. Shouldn't have been on the show. But overall I loved it. I look forward to buying Season 2.
2,What is pictured is not the flag you receive,"The flag pictured is not actually what I received. What I got was a blue flag with a fake Utah emblem. The eagle on the flag is poorly drawn and so is the beehive. The flowers to each side of the beehive should be sego lilies but instead they are red roses (someone doesn't know Utah history). The numbers for 1847 have a space between the 18 and 47.The flag is also completely see-through (if you hold it up, you can easily see through the material).I guess I shouldn't complain since the flag was only $5. I just want others to know that this flag is a fake."
3,Affirmation Web is Good,"I really like the affirmation web and the way the CD encourages children to use their imaginations. But, the woman's voice is a little too soft and it grates my nerves a little. I like the message and stories, but the story teller could use a different voice."
5,Indigo Ocean Dreams,"My Son LOVES this CD, we have several and i would recommend to every parent! its very Simple wonderful!! He listen to it every night before goes to sleep and then He sleeps sound and peaceful."
5,Great for 4 year olds and 30 year olds!,"I bought this for my 4-year-old daughter who is high-spirited and has a hard time settling down at night. She loves this. We keep the CD on ""repeat"" through the night. That way if she wakes up, she just listens to the CD and it puts her back to sleep. No need to come to Mom and Dad's room! Yay! It's also the only meditation CD that I enjoy, for myself."
4,Jennloa,"I purchased this CD for my four year old son just a few weeks after he was diagnosed with insulin dependent diabetes. I have found all of the books and the two children's CDs in this series to be a nice introduction for my son to identify with his feelings and learn important relaxation techniques. As this has been a time of great change and fraught with emotion, these products are providing my son with valuable skills to help him (and me!) navigate our way through this challenging time."
3,Somewhat a disappointment,"Again, this came with the other Indigo Dreams that I bought. It looked like it was a copied CD that was sold to me. Also the children packaged it and then came with a note that they were a single parent. Like I care, I just hoped that it was not a copied CD."
5,Just what we were looking for!,"This stamp is the perfect size for what we needed. It's smaller than most date stamps and allows us to choose if we need it to say recieved, faxed, etc. We love it!"
3,Quality: 2 Stars Price: 4 Stars,"I'll admit I bought this one, not for me, but for the wife. If you're looking for a super sharp and clear picture, you won't get it from this monitor, but I find it's acceptable for general computer work. The dot pitch is a little higher than my other LCD monitor. If a LCD monitor is a must have due to space or weight concerns and you're limited on funds, it is an acceptable choice. No problems or complaints about it from her."
3,"Nice,But","This product is nice once you get the settings to where you want them.But dealing with the manufacture.Is another story.They don't respond to your e-mails.And they give you a hard time, paying you back your rebate.If you ever get it.So I don't know how reliable customer service would be."
3,hdtv antenna,"I bought this antenna cause of all the good reviews that Ive read online. Its true that the construction is flimsy, cause my roommate broke off the connector after a few days, but I was able to solder it back on. If you have no obstructions in your way like trees a building, even a wall or window, this antenna will pick up great signals. Best place to have this antenna is near a window. This indoor antenna just wasn't doing it for me, so I bought the db2 antenna which does wonders. It may cost a little bit more but the reception is much better. If you have a direct line of site to the transmitters than this antenna will be fine. If you have obstructions in your way I'd try and find another antenna like the db2. The db2 is really one of the best short/medium ranged indoor/outdoor antenna for the money."
2,UHF indoor antenna,Frankly my old bowtie worked better than this thing! I expected better reception than what I got. Pretty but near useless.
1,Absolutely worthless,I bought this antenna for my Samsung digital tv thinking it will improve the reception but turned out that I got worse reception with this antenna than my current rooftop antenna. I live about 40 miles from most of the TV station.
3,Outdoor antenna is better,"I have an old roof antenna (maybe about 20 years old). Surprisingly when I installed my new plasma last month I received most digital stations clearly. There were a few that were not the best - and then I found that according to the time of day I might have some stations that did come in well that at other times of day had a weak signal.So with the great reviews for this antenna I thought I could improve my reception.My outdoor antenna proved to be better than the Zenith one. So I think a clarification is in order - this may be one of the best INDOOR antennas - but if you have the ability to have a roof antenna, do that.This antenna is a better choice only for those who can ONLY use an indoor antenna."
2,not good,"I live in san diego, Ca I live only 10 miles from most antennas. It picks up some stations put you still have to play with to much. I went and picked up the terk tv5 this indoor antenna blows the ZHDTV1 away I pick up all the local HD channels great."
2,Disappointing Performer,"I picked up one of these after reading dozens of great reviews in various forums. To my dismay, I was only able to pick up 4 of the 6 HD stations that are located within 14 miles of my location, and 2 of those were rather weak signals (signal strength in the 50-60 range). This was after extensive tweaking to get the strongest signal possible.Replaced it with a Radio Shack 15-1880 and things dramatically improved. Now I get all 6 stations, 5 of them with readings in the 90 range.I really liked the compact size and ease of use of the ZHDTV1. I was hoping it would be the solution for me. I did test it out in a home closer to the HD tower, at about 5 miles. It worked very well in that location. I would give it a much higher rating as a short distance antenna. But as it was advertised at having a range well beyond my 14 miles, I have to rate it as a 2-star performer."
2,Flimsy Antenna,"This antenna picks up the reception decently, and it has a nice design. However, the antenna is flimsy, and it broke easily. I ended up purchasing the Terk Technology HDTVi VHF/UHF HDTV Indoor Antenna and the Terk Low-Profile Indoor Antenna (TV5). Those antennas have proven to be better antennas because they are sturdier, and they pick up reception quite well."
3,Doesn't work for me,"Living 15 miles away from broadcasting tower. I connected the antenna directly to my HD-ready TV. Able to find 5 channels with the antenna, but none is clear. Not sure if I need extra equipment."
3,OVERRATED,"I was expecting big things from this antenna from the reviews. It didn't even outperform the $12 antenna I bought from Target - and that one has vhf and is less directional.This is not worthless, it's just not significantly better than other indoor antennas, and it's UHF only."
2,Unable to pick up channels,"I bought the Zenith HDTV Digital Indoor Antenna expecting it to live up to the product description, but my unit did not work as advertised. I live roughly 50 miles outside of Washington DC, where most of the HD over-the-air channels are broadcast. I believe due to the distance, I was not able to pick up any channels. My friend has the same model, and he lives closer to DC, and can pick up on all the available channels. If you live close to a major city, then this antenna will work for you. If you don't then it will not."
4,Great low-cost HD indoor antenna,"Antenna was easy to setup. I was surprised at how many HD channels (9) I was able to pick up (the nearest station is about 30 miles away from my suburban home). I set it up next to my TV. Probably would have gotten even better reception if I installed the antenna up in the attic (didn't try it). Finding the optimum direction to point the antenna is a bit tricky since I had to iterate between pointing the antenna and using my TV's auto-channel detection function. Fortunately, once the TV found some channels, I could use the TV's on-screen signal strength meter to make fine adjustments to the antenna position. I rated the antenna a 4 instead of 5 because of its somewhat flimsy-looking construction. Overall, this antenna performs outstanding for an indoor model."
4,Great product! Could be more stable however,"I really like this antenna. Tied in with my Hauppage HDTV usb receiver, it picks up signals like a charm! However the only down side is that it is easily knocked over as the base is comprised of plastic with a metal plate on the base. Since the cable hangs off the back, it tends to make it want to tip backwards. They could have counterbalanced it a little better. Other than that, it works as promised and is great!"
2,doesn't pull in the hdtv,I bought this antenna when I bought my Samsung SIR-T151 HDTV Receiver. So far I haven't been able to get good performance from it. In fact I've been able to get better reception using an old FM dipole antenna like you use with a stereo receiver.
2,This item may not be better than your regular RCA antenna,I heard lots of good things about this attenna so I bought one to work with my HDTV receiver. But it only picked up 4 HDTV channnels while my regular RCA can pick up total 11 HDTV CHANNELS in my location.
1,Disappointing,"Marginally better than a set-top RCA antenna, but not sufficiently strong to be of any use to anyone not located very near a broadcast area. Oh, well-at least it was a relatively inexpensive bad investment!"
1,Useless,Do not waste your money on this antenna. I'm 5 miles away from the broadcast antenna and it would not pickup a single station!
3,"Reception good, but needs glue","The reception is good, but one of the fins was loose and more importantly the connection to the connector/antenna broken when i went to move it and I had to send it back for replacement."
3,Not good enough performance...,"I could only recieve 2 HD channels, and not at the same time (I had to rotate the antenna around). My HDTV is only 27"" so the digital DISH signal it recieves looks pretty good, I'm just going to stick with it for a while. The difference between digital and HD is extremely noticable on giant TVs, but on a 27"" the difference is not worth the extra $ for DishHD or Direct TV.FYI, I live about 30 miles outside Tampa, all of the antennaweb broadcasts are 30-45 miles from me."
3,Seems to work,"I haven't compared this antenna with any others, but it definitely picks up all the digital stations in my area. It works better with the tuner in my Samsung TV than with the HDTV tuner in my PC, though."
2,Works but marginal,I expected a lot from this antenna after reading some of the glowing reviews. I should have been more wary. The antenna does have directivity as advertised but the resulting signal is only marginally better than shortened rabbit ears or a UHF loop. Shipping the thing back will cost me as much as half the purchase price so I eat it and remember where I got it.
5,This is a great record for Reggae lovers,"Whispering Lion has a cool vibe; this is a nice record; lots of excellent songs. I especially love Up 2 Us, its positive and mellow and has a great riddim. Lovers Night is also a favorite because I like love songs. Trouble Stop, Lion Lay Down, and Rise Up are very conscious and more political. Go Whispering Lion, yr fan Betty (Paris in Love)."
5,Week-by-week objectives and recommendations,"It's a new age when the computer can be more effective in helping a man or woman to meet than bar hopping or church dances. David Abernathy and Naomi Ballard collaborate in Internet Dating: Find Your Mate In 90 Days Or Less to help their readers navigate this new means of forming connections. Navigating preparations one should undergo, the criteria for selecting the right internet dating service, what to expect, week-by-week objectives and recommendations, and much more, Internet Dating is a serious, nuts-and-bolts outline and a welcome supplement especially for singles just getting used to the information highway."
4,A story for all times,"Oedipus Rex is truly timeless. The copy I read was not entirely poetic, but the story of a man ruined by his own pride and arrogance presents humankind with a portrait of itself. We ofted need to see ourselves through the eyes of another. Sophocles is not just a playwright, but a proven social critic."
4,Works Like A Charm,"Lives up to the other reviews. Works great, light weight and connected to my phone on the first try."
1,"Does not work in United States, Comes with European plug","I could not use and had to return item because it comes with a European plug, now Amazon was good about returning my money but it was a lot of time and hassle for nothing, the website should be updated, and I do not see that, that has happened as of yet."
1,Underwater headset?,Sounds like I'm underwater when I use it. Too much of a pain to return it so I'm simply eating the cost.
4,Convenient.,"I previously owned a plantronics and loved how easy it is. When the charger died on it, after 2+ years, I decided I need a new blue tooth. I bought a motorolla only to be disappointed. So I purchased this one to be my replacement. I like this one. My only issue is the syncing with my phone isn't always the best. Sometimes it will disconnect in less that 5 ft. But I think that might be my phone rather than this product."
3,A good product for the price,"There is a little bit of static sometimes, but it doesn't really interfere that badly. One of the real drawbacks is that the mouth piece is particularly sensitive to sounds of the road, and callers often complain about it sounding like the window is open even if its not. Also, it gets staticy when your more than 5 or 6 feet from your phone. Overall, I'd say that it was a good purchase because it was inexpensive and it works fairly well."
4,It gets the job done.,The reason I chose this headset was b/c it was inexpensive. I have had it now for a couple of weeks & I haven't had any problems with it. If you want a cheap bluetooth headset then this is the way to go.
4,Never had a problem with Plantronics,"I am giving this headset four stars because I have had multiple Plantronics bluetooth headsets, and this is not my favorite, but it definitely gets the job done. This headset retails for approx. $60.00, and so for that I say it is definitely worth it's dollar for what Amazon has it listed for. I never have any reception issues, and it holds its charge for a long time. I would recommend this headset to anyone."
3,Comfortable but short range,"I suppose i am used to electronics with a bit longer of an effective range than just a few feet. This headset has problems with any barrier or any kind, holding the phone produces static, setting down in a cupholder produces constant static, your pocket is even worse. Go for this if you have a big thing for cheap style or something, but it is definitely not worth it if you actually want to use a headset for its intended purpose of talking on a phone clearly and audibly."
2,Cons outweigh the Pros,Pros: Fits firmly in either ear. Looks good. Holds charge for a long time.Cons: Amplifies surrounding noise (even air flow from vents)! Slow to connect when answering a call. Connection with handset fades in and out on any call at anytime in any location.I would never recommend this product to anyone. 2-stars.
2,Quantity not clear!,"Beware, you are buying a total of 10 pins only for $6.91. In the ""product features"" section, it says ""includes 10 staples per pack"" and in the title it says ""10-pack"". I thought ""it can't be 10 pins for $7, it must be 10x10=100 pins."" Well I was wrong. You can buy 500 pins for $30 from other vendors, for one tenth of the price of these pins here."
5,A Classic!,This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor are great together!
5,COMIC GENIES !,i FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD...IM NOW 30 AND EVERY TIME I SEE IT I LAUGH EVEN MORE THAN THE LAST TIME! YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THEIR (RICHARD PRYOR/GENE WILDER) FACES AND YOU WILL BESIDE YOURSELF LAUGHING ! A TRUE COMEDY CLASSIC...ITS DOESNT PRETEND TO BE HIGH BROW JUST FUNNY ! THIS MOVIE WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH OUT LOUD AGAIN AND AGAIN..IM SO GLAD I AM PRESERVING IT AS A DVD FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO SEE ! A MUST SEE ..GO AHEAD LAUGH OUT LOUD AND ENJOY.
3,FUNNY!,"Just for the scene where Craig Nelson's character tries to teach Wilder a lesson by sticking him in a small box and a week later without much air and no food Wilder says,""One more week please!"" genuinely meaning it, makes this movie worthwhile. Such moments are priceless."
2,I didn't like this one much,"Witherington outlines the many different views of the Jesus Quest on who Jesus was and cites a few authors for each view. He just goes a little too far in trashing the opinions of his fellow scholars (many of which are better than him). The most valuable part of this book was the list of authors he has in his table of contents. Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, Burton Mack, E.P. Sanders, Geza Vermes, Gerd Thiessen, Richard Horsley, Elizabeth Scussler Fiorenza, and the Jesus Seminar. Read these authors instead of wasting your time reading about what Witherington THINKS about each of them."
4,An excellent summary of what scholars are saying about Jesus,Witherington carefully critiques what scholars are saying about the Son of God. And then he presents a positive biblical portrait of the Savior. Written for the evangelical community. But important and accessible to all.
4,conservative but engaging,"Witherington's book is a bit outdated now that a few years have passed; however, it is still a good introduction to the value of Jesus studies. Skeptics may not like his obviously critical approach towards much of the scholarship that he presents; however, this is without a doubt the most conservative-friendly introduction there is out there. The greatest strength about Witherington's book is that it can appeal to conservative Christians and open many up to critical scholarship--I've seen this happen ot many friends to whom I've loaned the book. Thus, it is a great door through which to walk into the larger world of NT biblical criticism, which I believe has a great deal of potential in tempering some of the extreme, ridiculous tendencies present in conservative Christianity."
5,Tom's floss,"I've tried just about every floss on the market. This floss is unique because it has a ""tooth"" to the flat floss, which creates more friction against the tooth surfaces. It is hard to find in stores, however. I would resort to almost anything to get it because I can't go back to regular floss."
5,Excellent floss,"Tom's flat floss (a.k.a., dental tape) is absolutely the best floss I've ever used, much superior to Reach and other waxed dental tape. It remains wrapped around my fingers without slipping, it resists shredding on sharp teeth, and if it does get shredded, it resists breaking into two pieces. It also slides easily between tight teeth. Even the case is good, dispensing easily and cutting without problems. They really got this one right!"
5,THE BEST FLOSS YOU'LL EVER FIND,"My husband and I agree, it really is the best. We have tried different brands and swear by Tom's of Maine. We use the toothpaste too!"
3,American Gigolo,"American Gigolo - This was just okay, not one ofGere's best performances. Got cumbersome at the end of movie."
4,Wonderful nostalgia,"What a great experience. This is such a little time capsule of 1980 's music and aesthetics. The DVD quality was a little grainy and appeared to be a video transfer, but this barely detracted from what was a wonderful return to a film very much of its time and all the better for it."
1,Unviewable,"I did not view this DVD because it came from the wrong zone. Hopefully, I can see this movie in the future and give a review."
3,Last gasp of Disco,"The significance of American Gigalo is capturing the mood of the disco movement in its waning days, and not of a compelling story line that draws you in.The story line itself is weak, as other reviewers have already panned it. A gigolo is framed for murder, set up by him pimp. Living the cream of life in its riches on his good looks, a murder accusation send his good life down a spiral. Along the decent, he picks up the love of a prominent politician's wife, who becomes his savior and true love, perhaps for the first time in his life.What makes American Gigalo fun is capturing the last breadth of the disco movement, of the lifestyle of when casual sex was safe, drugs were no big deal, and the music was still dance-able. This was the film that made Richard Gere the movie icon that he is today.Watch this movie for a trip down memory lane, but don't expect a great story out of it."
4,It's Nikki Turner.. of course it's good,Another one of Nikki Turner's great novels. It was good not the best but good none the less.. She keeps it real as usual.
5,"NIKKI, NIKKI, NIKKI",ALL I CAN SAY IS ONCE AGAIN THE QUEEN OF HIP HOP FICTION HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THIS BOOK HAD YOU HOOKED WHERE YOU COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN. SHE EVEN HAD CHARACTERS FROM HER PERVIOUS BOOKS IN THIS BOOK ALSO. ALL I CAN SAY IS GET THIS BOOK NOW.
5,A STELLAR READ!!!,"What can I say, Nikki has done it once again!! I very rarely post reviews on novels I have read. However, this novel has moved me to write. This book effortlessly flows from one characters plight to the next character without making the transition seem choppy or unrealistic. It gives an in-depth view into the mind of the characthers and allows the reader to judge for him/herself the actions of the characthers. When I finished the novel I felt as though I had lived the life of Mercy and left wondering what would become of her and C-Note (Cleezy) when it was all said and done."
2,"Downward Facing ""Doggy""?","He lost me with Downward Facing ""Doggy"". It got worse with his use of the word ""fricken"". Then I couldn't take any more when he started talking about making love to his lover. All the while I'm having to listen to his irritating lisp. Terrible CD! Doesn't move along at all, boring!"
5,Great for removing dust from slides and film,I have used this Air Blaster to remove dust from 35mm slides and film that I am scanning into digital files. It has a high volume of air in the blaster and consequently does a very good job of removing unwanted particles before scanning.
3,IT WORKS,"THIS PRODUCT MAY BE A BIT OVERATED AND HYPED, BUT IT WORKS. THE AIR THAT IS BLOWN IS NOT VERY POWERFUL. IT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO MOVE DUST AND THAT'S IT.Rom 5:6 Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful.Rom 5:7 No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person.Rom 5:8 But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful"
1,Rocket Air Blaster Blasts Air,"This is a handy device, built to last. It does one thing only, blasts air when you squeeze it, and does this well. Helps blow dust off camera equipment so you don't touch the galss to clean it. Simple product. Well constructed. Should last a lifetime. You use it to blow air on stuff you don't want to touch. That's all I have to say about that."
5,Works Well. Pretty Big,"I needed an air blaster like this to clean my camera lenses, and I really like this product. I was a little surprised at the size since I thought it would be smaller, but it works as described and the price is pretty good."
3,Not bad,"When it says ""Includes a one-way valve to prevent Blaster from breathing in dust and spreading it back to your equipment"" don't believe it.... there is a one way valve at the bottom, (There is no filter though) but nothing at the tip.....so it sucks air right back in from the tip as well....so make sure you remove the tip from all sources of dust before you inflate the item again.... just a suggestion. Other than that, it works great."
5,Works great in combination with the Lens Pen sensor cleaner!,I purchased this item along with the Lens Pen Sensor cleaner. They both worked very well. I documented my sensor cleaning project over at The Geek's Garage on blogspot. You can see for yourself how much the combination of both tools worked to get rid of my sensor dust. Highly recommended![...]
4,"It Blows, in a good way !!!",I use this to clean my D200 and lenses. It does a very good job of blowing of dust and fabrics. More powerful than the one I used to have.
5,bigger than expected,"I know it said large but it was bigger than expected. Won't fit in my everyday camera bag but otherwise it does everything I expected it to. If your looking for a way to clean your camera, sensor, mirror or lenses this is for you. Quickly and safely removes dust with a puff of air with out the excess force of air dusters that use propellants."
4,Beware at airports,"This blaster is great, very efficient for my cleaning lenses. However, the security folks at Cancun airport confiscated the ""bomb"" as it looks like a ... well - bomb! At least it does for those guys."
4,Nice alternative,"It sure beats buying canned air which can be a problem. It tired out my hands the first time I used it due to the work required and the amount of dust I had. Still, it should last forever, and that's a good value."
5,Ever photographer needs one,This is a high quality product that ever photographer needs for clean their equipment. A BIG blast of air with each squeeze. It blasts the dust off and has saved us money because we don't have to send in the gear as often to the camera shop. Cleans keyboard really well too.This is the size to start with but is big in the camera bag. We ordered a second one that it smaller for the bag.
2,Falling apart after 5 years,Just pulled my rocket blower off the shelf after about a year to blow off some computer gear. Rubber turned my hand black. I put a cloth around it as I used it and it turned the cloth black. The rubber is falling apart. It is still working well but it will make a constant mess until it wears out. The QC sticker on it says 2008. I bought it July of 08. Ugh.
1,"Warning, not for DSLR sensor cleaning!!!","Don't people read anymore? I went to buy this thing today for cleaning the sensor of my DSLR camera and there in black and white, on the back of the package, was the warning that it is not recommended for cleaning CCD sensors! What gives?"
5,useful!,"I've been using it everywhere! I don't personally have a camera to use it on,but I bought this to clean out keyboards (laptop and desktop) without buying canned air over and over.It does great job cleaning keyboards, and also cleaning out the fan/heatsink.I use it to clean all small electronics I have!"
4,Terrific product,"Works great! I don't care to use canned air as you can damage ""O"" rings or seals. This is not a small product but it works and with great price."
4,I love my blower.,"I love playing with this, what can I say? It's a blower. It works well at doing what a hand-held blower does. It doesn't remove sticky dust and debris, but it works well on loose dirt."
5,removes dust particles,I like the Gittos Rocket air blaster. It works well to get rid of the stubborn dust particles.More reliable than a can of air (they always seem to run out when you need them).
4,Right tool for the job,"I got this as a gift for my brother who is often working on computers - he says, ""the rocket air blaster is phenomenal as a condensed air replacement and fun to play with as well."" :)"
5,Air Blower for Digital Camera,It works great - and no touching the sensor with a brush. Great product
4,Works well at home where size isn't a problem,"This does push lots of air, quickly, so works very well for cleaning lenses and other things.I'm not finding any intake from the front as I've read others were concerned about. The air intake is at the base where the legs are, and there's apparently an intake valve to prevent sucking dust in from the front."
3,"Good, but don't think that you don't need a professional cleaning ever again.","I went to our local camera store and picked this up yesterday. After three tries (of multiple pumps each), I was able to remove the big dust specks, but most of the little specks remained. I read a review that I think stated it best, most people are reviewing this like it is the end all image sensor cleaning system, rocketing it to mythic proportians. It is good at what it does, blowing some dust off the sensor, but you will still need a professional cleaning every once in a while. I had my sensor cleaned once in the last two years, but I am looking at doing it every six months now because nothing beats a professional cleaning! I recommend this product, but it is for upkeep, not the solution!"
4,"Don't be fooled by the ""Book Review""","I enjoyed this one, though not a favorite. One thing detracted from my enjoyement- the Book Review is focused on the flight of Tiffany. That event does not occur until the last 45 pages of the book. Because of the way the Book Review was written, every time Tiffany acted up (which was often), I expected ""the flight"" to take place."
3,Good early garage rock,"This disc is an eye opener. Who knew there were so many Halloween-related songs around? This is generally a fun disc but I had to return a copy because of faulty sound around cuts 14-18. It sounded like there were problems with the copy itself. However, my replacement disc still had these problems which may be a by-product of copying from old worn out original discs. I was also hoping for several tunes with prototype Lux Interior styled howlings, growlings and the like. Not enough whoops, hollers, ominous laughs, shrieks, etc but they are still in evidence a little bit. Still not a bad disc to have around during Halloween-time."
5,`Saw them on this Tour,I am an old head Rush freak.I saw them on this tour when I was 14.You do the math.Damn I feel old.Anyway it's probably my favorite Rush album of the pre signals years.After that I kinda lost interest.
4,Very enjoyable,"I didn't care much for Rush's '70s-work until I listened to this album. I think this is one of their most melodic, beautiful and consistent albums. ""Closer to the Heart"" is the best-known track on this album, but the rest is equally fine. The songs are more accessible than Rush's lengthy art-rock pieces on ""2112"" and ""Hemispheres"", and the sound on this remastered edition is very good. The lyrics on this album are really inspired and much more electrifying than on Rush's '90s-work. ""A Farewell to Kings"" is another timeless album (like ""Moving Pictures"") and shows Rush's virtues at their best."
4,A Winner!,"After a first listen to ""A Farewell To Kings,"" half of the six songs stand out noticeably: ""Xanadu,"" ""Cygnus X-1,"" and the now Rush standard, ""Closer To The Heart."" They are the main course of the album. Almost everyone has heard ""Closer To The Heart,"" a true classic, and a song the band has done live on every tour since it was recorded. It is a true gem! The two ten minute plus tracks, ""Xanadu"" and ""Cygnus,"" are art-rock masterpieces. Songs that roll like a roller coaster with their catchy musical changes.With all that exhilaration, don't pass over the other three songs. The title track is a nice pounding song, a great opening for the album. ""Cinderella Man"" rocks hard and ""Madrigal,"" an easy, pleasing ballad, slowing the pace down, a chance for one to catch your breath before the journey of ""Cygnus X-1."" Overall the album is a winner!"
5,Best booster seat!!!,"We have two of these seats (one for my 4 year old that we've had for about 2 years, and one that we just bought for my 2 year old). We LOVE these boosters! They do not slide off the chair too easily, they are a great height, very comfortable (according to my kids), and they clean easily. AND...considering we've had one for 2 years already with very few signs of wear, I give it an A+ for durability!You won't regret purchasing this - and your kids will love it!"
5,"Comfy, stable and easy to clean","This is a great booster seat for the price, and we have been very happy with it for almost two years. We plan to pass it on to our younger child too. It's solid, but has some give, so it's not super hard to sit on, and it has a no-slip base that really hugs our wooden chairs. The surface is easy to wipe clean, and even wash in the sink for those tough messes."
4,my toddler loves it,"I decided to get this seat over the cooshie, and I'm very happy with it so far. I love the bright orange color. My son loves it and takes it with him to sit on the hard floor as well. I like that it's removable and not strapped down to the chair. Cleanup has been easy with the exception of smushed blueberries, which left a slight discoloration on the seat. I could try something a little harsher to get it out, but I'd rather not make it worse. I know some reviews said the seat rips eventually, if mine does that I will post an update!"
5,Amazing,Everyone askes me where I got this seat. It's just like a bumbo - easy to wipe clean and does a good job with a little boost.
3,I really liked this...if it were taller,"I have a 2 1/2 year old of average height (36"") and when I put him in this booster he could barely rest his arms on the table. He definitely wasn't boosted tall enough. It is too bad because I loved the material and softness of this seat. I am returning it. Just not tall enough."
5,Great,Very nice cutting board....especially for the price. Size is perfect and the grooves around the sides are great. Happy with this purchase
4,"Head, shoulders, knees and toes!!!","My 2 year old loves this video. She loves the puppets, as with the other Baby Einstein videos we own, but she loves this one even more because of the kids. Her favorite part is when they sing ""Head, shoulders, knees and toes."" She follows and sings right along with them. She has lost interest in Baby Mozart and Beethovan, which are geared more toward infants. This one holds her attention. She calls it ""the monkey movie"" because she loves the monkey puppets. The only boring part which does not seem to hold her attention is when they draw the body parts. Other than that, this is a great video to have."
2,Baby Da Vinci,"My grandson, 15 months old, lost interest every time the hand drawings started. I understand that the ""Da Vinci"" in the title would imply that there are drawings, but it would have been a better DVD for my grandson if the creators had just left those out. He loves the World Animals DVD, but this one will just be filed away. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,On a night when you have nothing else to do..........,"Personally, I wasn't impressed with the flow of the movie. Barbara, of course, was superior even in her early career.I found the movie difficult to follow.If you don't have anything to do...watch it and prove me wrong."
5,My favorite Streisand comedy,"I just love this movie.It's still funny after 25 years.The best part is when the Bull and Cows run right through the Movie screen during the Western,and Barbra's shouting,""Girls,come back here."" I love Mrs Cherry,and Barbra's try at being one of her call girls.Not only is Streisand one of the greatest singers will ever know,but a great comedian as well. Along with""The Owl and the Pussycat,"" this is my favorite Barbra Streisand comedy."

4,College Knowledge,"This was an interesting book & it arrived quickly! It reads fairly easily and is chock full of important information for parents, teachers and guidance counsellors!"
2,Don't bother,"This is the worst book of the series and is a waste of time. Pharmacology cannot be taught by clinical vignettes and the author himself recognizes this. In the book review section of First Aid, Dr. Bhushan admits that it is not an ideal review source. The problem is that within two lines of the clinical vignette, the drug is revealed, so there is no chance to guess the answer. There are less time consuming ways to learn the side effects of drugs."
3,Functional but Cheap,"I bought this monitor in June. Within two weeks, the screen would go black after a few seconds of use. I decided to pursue the warranty route, instead of simply returning it to Amazon. The warranty card had invalid contact information. After some Googling, I was able to get what I needed from a web site. The warranty, which is only 90 DAYS, instructed me to repackage the monitor box within another box. $30 in shipping and 2-3 weeks later, I got my repaired monitor.So after all that, I was left with a working monitor. For the price and quality, I'm still happy with my purchase. Every so often I get some flickering in the corner, but it doesn't last. As other reviewers say, it is not a movie quality monitor, but it is fine for general use. Considering the price and size and the fact that they did honor the warranty, it still gets three stars."
1,Never Recieved Monitor,I Never recieved the monitor. I also never got an e-mail.Or anything. This person should be investigated. The wost experienceI have ever had with ordering products online
4,"Simple, easy, and cheap","Worked straight out of the box - simple to hook up. Easy to get working - although there's the usual on-screen adjustments, I didn't 'em. It worked fine without any fiddling. And it's cheap - lowest cost 17"" lcd monitor I could find.A few minor things ... It's fine when you look straight at the screen, but from much of an angle, you'll lose both colors and contrast. No problem for an author, but not so good if you're sharing movies with friends.Edges of letters sometimes flicker when viewing reverse (white-on-black) ... this can be ameliorated by tweaking the on-screen pixel-clock-rate. Those built in speakers are fine for computer beeps, but not for movies!Conclusion - perfectly fine, until someone comes out with backlit lcd wallpaper."
4,Works as advertised.,I had no problems in hooking up and programming. I call my place in Alaska daily and changes in temp and battery voltage tell me it's working in as advertised. It would have 5 stars if the temp sensor had a longer lead. Yet be aware do not use a surge protecter in your phone hook-up. I did and messed up the freeze alarm and my answering machine so I couldn't call my house when it was 30 below outside! (That's fahrenheit.)
3,it's just OK,"It’s just OK, it's good but not great. For over 15 years I had before another freeze alarm control and it was more sophisticated, it was calling out 4 numbers, I could call and was able to listen, it trigger alarm when any noise happened, and it had much more other features."
2,Mildew!,"This mat is comfy and soft, but it mildews badly even with frequent washings. The stains do not come out. I bought this mat b/c I thought having the holes throughout vs. others would allow it to dry and avoid the mildew...but that is clearly not the case. I'm very disappointed."
1,Should have listened to other Amazon reviews,"Amazon has the WORST selection of tub mats on the planet. I don't know why, but they do. Some reviewers claimed this was a great mat for them, others said that it does not stick/floats up when there is water in the tub and/or is dangerous. The latter are correct. This mat is a major bathroom hazard!!! Listen to your fellow reviewers and don't buy it. As much as this pains me to say: you will not find a decent tub mat on Amazon!"
1,Waste of $10,"This is one of the worst excuses for a bath mat I have seen. It does not stay put in the tub and is very dangerous to use. The suction cups DO NOT adhere to the tub as advertised and the mat floats on top of the water. Trying to get in the tub on top of the floating bathmat is very dangerous and could lead to serious injury. A total waste of money, DO NOT BUY."
1,Worthless tub mat,"Do not purchase this mat. Not until it arrives and you are able to read the directions wrapped around it do you learn that you must wait until water is in the tub to put in the mat, at which point it is virtually impossible to get the mat to flatten out. Think about trying to wrestle an inflatable object under water. After some pushing and shoving, I found the mat partially stuck with its little suction cups but not stuck flat; by then it was stuck too hard to get out but not stuck flat. Thus, I took my bath lying on a surface even more uncomfortable than the bare tub. The worst came when I stood up after the water ran out and found the mat actually MORE SLIPPERY than my bare tub.Griptex Comfort 17 by 36-Inch Bath Mat, Blue"
1,No suction!,The bathmat I received did not do its job. The suction cups on the bottom had NO suction so the mat continually floats to the top of the water when we gave our daughter a bath. Please reconsider this item as there are many others to choose from.
2,Standing on mud in bathtub,"Does not do a great job of staying in place, usually slides down the bathtub. Stains easily and not easily cleaned. Would not recommend unless you dont take many showers and have a perfectly flat tub."
2,Bath Mat,Feels great on feet but soap and hairs get collected in the bathtub after the shower is over because it is too bulky in my tub...gets kind of gross after awhile...this size and particular style mat would be perfect for a much bigger bathtub.
1,I should have listened,"I had read the mixed reviews of this product before I bought it. But the mat was better-looking than the others, so I hoped the naysayers were wrong. Unfortunately, they were right. The grippers do not have sufficient grip, even under perfect conditions. If even a little extra water gets under the mat, it wants to float. The cheap, ugly rubber mats you can buy in grocery stores do a better job."
2,surprisingly weak female character for Nora Roberts,"Didn't care for this one at all and the female character was really weak. Oddly, she writes much better male characters"
5,The Dream Trilogy #1,The beginning book of The Dream Trilogy #1 was so good that after I finished I immediately order Trilogy #2 and after that Trilogy #3. These books will have you sitting on the edge of your seat! Nora Roberts is one of my favorite authors and she out did herself with the Dream Trilogies. I read all 3 books in 2 days!
1,An Enemy among Them,"If your looking for a GREAT book, well then dont read An Enemy among them. This book is relly boring. Please just stop. Put the book down. Ok, my friend Cassandra is telling me to write this."
4,ignores the most interesting question,"I found this book to be a light, breezy read. It's great if that is what you are looking for, but I would have liked a little more depth. The question that is most interesting to me is ignored: how did people propagate and hybridize the tulips? I am a gardener myself, and i would love to know the answer to this question. Every time the book says ""...and soon there were dozens of tulip gardens..."" i got frustrated."
1,Some of the worst you can get.....,"Stay away from all the crap zeze e luciano done...It's all the same nulity, some of the worst you can get from the music industry! It's so lame and ridiculous...JUST LOOK AT THE ALBUM FRONT COVER!!!!UNBELIAVABLE, but sad but true!"
4,Emotional Rape Syndrome Book,"When I began my journey of healing from being emotionally raped, I was wondering if I would ever really heal from it. I'm still on the road to recovery, but this book has been a true blessing! It has shown me that I can and will recover and that I'm not crazy and that everything I felt or am still feeling is ok. I suggest everyone who has had their soul ripped from them by being emotionally raped to read ""The Emotional Rape Syndrome."""
1,Gag me - and gag him!,"This guy has has had nothing new to say in at least ten years. If this is what you want, then more power to you. I'll take the spatula. But it hasn't been fresh since 1993. Publishers should be ashamed of continuing to promote this loser."
5,No complaints here !!!,"Great!!! Maximum Achievement: Strategies and Skills That Will Unlock Your Hidden Powers to Succeed, this book is exactly what I was looking for and expected. Our transaction went off without a hitch! I would use this vendor anytime as actions speak much louder than words.Excellent A +++ Thank you, Jeff"
5,Great Fit!,I have been looking for a replacement mirror for a long time. The K-Source 90035 fit my 2000 Ford Ranger perfectly. It has been in place for about 4 months with no issue. If you need a replacement mirror for your vehicle these are the way to go.
5,Great Show,This show brought back something that was missing from prime time television for a long time: good writing and acting. The only problem is that you want more than 13 episodes included in this set. The first two seasons of The Practice was the best. Buy this and you won't be disappointed. Guest stars such as Linda Hunt and Ed Asner are great.
5,"Osbert Sitwell: Yes, he is worth a book","Author Philip Ziegler poses the question: Is Osbert Sitwell worth a book? Naturally, having written a superb and colorful biography of a second-rate writer but world class eccentric, his answer is yes. I agree. Osbert is a piece of work -- and a bundle of contradictions. An elitist with kindness and thoughtfulness for all classes of people; a pacifist who liked to be known as Captain Sitwell for his brief stint in a fashionable regiment; an epicure and lover of luxury who was nonetheless broke for much of his life; and a never-quite-in-the-top-rank poet and novelist whose most enduring work is his autobiography. Ziegler's biography is meticulously researched and documented; fluent, witty and affectionate."
3,Good playing but can be a little repetitive.,The playing is great on this album but some songs sound like the others. I would give this album 3 1/2 stars.
2,Extremely repetitious,Practically half of the selections on this CD start out exactly the same!!!! Then they go into endless jazz style rambling in the body of the song until the end of the selection when the same old intro is repeated again!!! This music severly lacks originality. I like this group's playing and it could be enjoyable with some variety.
4,not latest rokenbok technology,this item will not work with the latest rokenbok infrared controls; dont buy it if you have the new setup
3,PC Magazine Windows XP Solutions,What I ordered is Hacking Windows XP by Steve Sinchak.you suggested PC magazine Windows XP Solutions unfortunate it is basic book for beginner and what I'm looking for advance book to increase my knowledge in Windows XP.
2,nipples notb that great,i got this bottles for my 3 month baby he hates the nipple because the milk flow is real slow he would have the bottle in his mouth for like an hour and he would only finish 4OZ with his other bottles it would only take 20 min. so the bottles are nice the colors are bright i change the nipples to the playtex advance they fit nicely and dont leek
4,This album is a sampler of Linda's Spanish language songs,"The sources for the 20 songs of this album are:six each from ""Canciones de mi Padre"", ""Mas Canciones"", and ""Frenesi"", andone each from ""Hasten Down the Wind"" and ""Winter Light.""Your enjoyment of this CD will depend on which other CDs you already own."
1,not that great,"I bought this for my daughter and the quality was bad. I have purchased other sheets for toddler beds and they were nice, but these ones were so thin that I could see through them and they were extremely rough. Since they were so cheap I decided mot to return them and just toss them."
1,"plagued by jitters, skipped frames, pixelation","I thought this would be a great solution for us since my toddler son is the main ""user"" of the dvd player and switching dics is a pain and exposed them to scrathes and so on. Unfortunately, after having this player for two weeks, it's obvious that it's just not up to snuff. Just last night I had to stop watching Lord of the Rings because of dropped frames and pixelation that kept annoying me. I plop the disc in our portable player and no problem. The same scenes play without a hitch. I think Panasonic cut too many corners on this one."
2,Bad choice?,"Perhaps it was just the particular unit I received, but this player had a problem recognizing DVDs and often wouldn't play them. Thankfully, Amazon has a great return process which made it easy for me to send it back for a full refund, and order the F85S model instead, which is so far working great!"
3,TWISTERVILLE,"DEVIL WINDS is full of all the cliches you expect in this kind of movie: a tornado expert miscalls a tornado and loses his wife in the process; a buxom up and coming reporter wants to make it to the bigtime; a new viral investigation clinic is built and may be in the path of a horrible twister, but the director vows to keep things going; and the hero has a daughter who blames him for her mother's death and doesn't want anything to do with him. But still, DEVIL WINDS succeeds due to a pleasant cast and computer-generated tornadoes that are pretty awesome, even if they don't look totally real. It's a movie and for a lower budgeted film, the fx team does okay. Joe Lando (Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, Combustion) does a staunch job as the hero and Baywatch's Nicole Eggert, looking a little heftier and unglamorous than usual, does okay too. Not as high quality as TWISTER, but still entertaining."
1,What!!,Paperback item listed for $115???? Joke? Perhaps a typo? Maybe the book is good but it can't be THAT good.
4,An empowering girl song,This is one of those songs that girls just love singing. It makes you feel that you're taking the world by the balls.
3,.,"I bought this simply for Ring The Alarm Freemason's Edit Mix,,could care less about the title track,,,"
5,A masterpiece of fantasy,"I have read this book over and over again. Vance's style is unique; it is hard to explain why, it has to do with the way he uses language. What comes out is a story that is sometimes wildly hilarious, in an odd, incongrous way. Cugel, the main character (known as ""the clever""), gets out of one jam after another in a curiously inept manner, all the more funny because of the language he uses...there I go, trying to explain it again, and I just can't. You'll notice it right away, if you read the book. The storyline is fascinating..the Earth, thousands of eons in the future, when the sun is a dying red giant and history has been written and re-written countless times. Hundreds of religions and philosophies compete with one another in this world, as do an equal number of civilizations with histories extending back for millenia. Cugel is journeying through this dying Earth, trying to return home, a wonderfully funny vagabond with a knack of surviving anything that comes his way."
3,Kitchen Whips,"Not being able to actually see how big (or small) these whips are, made it a bit hard to know what to expect. Unfortunately, these are really too small for almost anything you do in the kitchen."
1,Mini means mini,"I thought I could use a small whisk, but these are really too small for the jobs I do in the kitchen. I have a large whisk and probably only need to find a 6 inch whisk. Both of these are really mini and not useful. Amazon does have a 6 inch whisk, but I haven't ordered it yet."
1,A Big Waste,"This tote is not very convenient, the outside pockets are much too large and stuff just falls out, in addition, the craftsmanship is very poor and the bag did not hold up well. Spend a little more and buy something that will last."
5,Wonderful!,I studied T'ai Chi with Martin Inn for many years. This CD has been a great way to reconnect with my practice.
4,For older kids too!,"My son who is almost 12yrs saw this toy at a friend's house and asked for it for Christmas. I was leary about ordering it because it states age limits of 12years. I must say that even though there's not a lot to the toy, it nonetheless is entertaining to him. Even my older girls all took a turn at scanning everything in the house for awhile. So, if your child likes the Pokeman/Yugio type monster cards/games then my guess is that he'll get enjoyment out of this toy as well. I must also concur with the other mothers who tell of stress free trips to the store now. He doesn't mind going along with me to run errands anymore. Hmmmm!"
1,Even bright 9 year olds have trouble with this toy,"My son got this because he tried to play this at a friends house (two brothers) and loved it, but they had already progressed with their scanning knowledge and the toy was ready to go when he borrowed theirs to play them. He immediately went out and bought one, and it was $20. He is sooooo frustrated and doesn't understand why when he went to the supermarket with me and scanned MANY items, nothing happened. We need some customer service to assist on what to scan and what not to so we waste no more time! I would NEVER by this for a gift."
3,Not sure !,"I normally like all of Susan Howatch's books but I'm not too sure about this one.It's a bit like a junior version of ""Rebecca"" It's a murder mystery peopled with dark characters and the hero has a mysterious former marriage.I finished it but it left me with an unsatisfied feeling.I found it in an op-shop so I don't suppose that many people will read it these days but I'd love to talk to anyone who does."
5,Cosmology,"For a reader who is familiar with general topics of astrophysics such as red shift, gravitational lensing, quasi stellar objects and the presently accepted view of the universum ,""Current Issues in Cosmology"" provides an excellent summary of the various underlying physical explanations. The collection of papers submitted during the conference at Collège de France in June 2004 is highly stimulating, because various alternate theories to the currently accepted Big Bang are explained. Although some mathematical formulas are part of the presentations, the narrative can be easily followed without digging into the technical details."
5,"El bootleg más completo, por mucho!!!","Este es un cd esencial para cualquier fan de Pearl Jam o cualquier fan de la buena música. Contiene por lo menos 3 o 4 canciones de cada uno de sus álbumes, más se complementa con lados-b, rarezas y covers de Lennon. El sonido no es de la misma calidad como los bootlegs de los tours del año 2000, pero es aceptable."
5,Macy does it again !!!,"It's the bomb y'all. I love every song.It's a must-have CD for your funk/ soul/jazz collection.One of the songs I like best is ""Every now and then""....it is very jazzy and cool."
5,To give this one star you dont like macy gray,Now if you would of gave the big cd one star i would almost understand not this albumif you like macy you will like it
2,poor macy,the music overpowers macy's great voice.. real bad job of production..would not recomend this album to show off macy
4,Great,I tkink this is a very good book telling about this outfit in WW11.I added some to this book and also the picture of Chet. It is written good and I am one of the few soldiers left of the 3132. I have two of this book and need several move for my family. Thanking you Harold Flinn
4,Nice Collection,I bought this as a birthday present for my Mother. She had been wanting to read Pride & Prejudice awhile. It's a bit thick but it contains 3 good books.
5,McNaught has a masterpiece!!,"Judith McNaught works her magic again!! This book is heart felt and heart wrenching at the same time. I encourage everyone to read this book. Once I started reading this book, I could not seem to stop. I don't want to give any spoilers away, but I will briefly comment on this story. It takes place in the early 1800's and I was hesitant to read a book about Dukes and so forth, but I truly enjoyed the story and loved the descriptive details JM provided. I really hope you enjoy this book as much as I do, and you will not regret your choice of reading this book!!"
5,An Emotional Reading,Victoria and Jason's story is great! I know others have written and said the same but I had to add my two cents worth. You will laugh and cry and believe in the power of love. This is classic McNaught at her best and this is one of my favorites of hers.You won't be disappointed in this story. Especially if you are a romantic at heart.
4,One of her best,"I think this book, along with ""Something Wonderful"" is one of Judith McNaught's best historical novels. I liked the ""tortured"" hero Jason and Victoria was a funny and endearing character. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I felt bad about what happened to Andrew at the end. After all the times his name is mentioned; he only appears twice, once in the beginning and then in the end, where he basically gets his heart broken. Other than that, good read and well written!"
2,I just couldn't get past how mean the Hero was...,"The heroine was easy to like, the hero was NOT. I ended up skipping a dozen pages at a time after the first third of the book because I got so tired of how mean the hero was. I have NO idea why the heroine could love him. He was just plain awful. I plowed through to the end, since I had spent money on the book, and normally like Judith McNaught, but this book is NOT a keeper. In fact, it was a waste of time."
5,A Piece of Perfection,"With just the introduction of Jason Fielding and Victoria Seaton, I automatically fell in love with this novel. Judith McNaught has created a magnificent work of art that is ""clearly destined for greatness."" I consider this novel to be the closet thing to perfection. I was not surprised that I found myself laughing and crying along with the characters. Ms. McNaught has once again been able to draw her readers into a dream. This is truly one of her best piece of writings yet! Theses characters have managed to spark every emotion inside me through their tender gestures. The love between Jason and Victoria has the ability to enchant readers everywhere. I highly recommend this novel but only if you are willing to witness a piece of perfection!"
2,Timer Recording - only analogue channels,"I purchased this machine mostly to timer record digital channels for later playback. The E50 Tuner only goes to 61 channels for Timer Recording whereas most digital cable channels or satellite are 200, 300 or higher. You cannot setup your Timer Recording to record different channels at different times if the channels are above channel 61. Very strange for a supposedly digital device."
5,A Masterful Masterpiece,"As a screenwriter, i much enjoyed watching this film for the first time as a teenager slowly understanding what career path i wanted to take. The mystery and suspense played out by the enigmatic and legendary Elizabeth Taylor, and blunt and also legendary Katherine Hepburn played out on my previoisly unknown desire to create masterpieces such as this movie. it will forever reamin on my top 10 list of experty acted, written, directed and produced films of all time."
4,GOOD READ FOR LONG WINTER NIGHTS,"TOOK A WHILE TO GET THROUGH THIS NOVEL, AND EVANS IS A TALENTED AUTHOR- HOWEVER THE PLOT SEEMS TO DRAG IN THE MIDDLE, I SUPPOSE I AM BEING UNFAIR AS I TYPICALLY PREFER MYSTERIES. THIS IS FINE FOR ANYONE THAT DOES NOT LIKE TO BE STRESSED OR IN A FRENZY TO 'FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED!!!' IT JUST MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY, AND I SUPPOSE FOR SOME IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE VERY INTERESTING. IF YOU ARE AN AVID FAN OF SANDFORD, PATTERSON, ILES, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU..."
4,Not that great...,"I agree with reader, Superstar, in that the daughter would nothave let the situation get so out of hand. Beyond that, however,I completely did not buy the characters Ty and Josh coveringup their involvement because they really had not committed acrime and the whereabouts of Abbie could have been solved muchsooner."
3,The Divide,"I love Nichohlas Evans' books and was looking forward to reading this one, but was a little dissapointed in it. It did draw me into the story, and kept me turning the pages, however, it was not quite the 'I can't put it down' mystery that my favorite book 'The Smoke Jumper' was. The overuse of the f#%k word was very distracting and not at all necessary to describe the moment. Overall, it is worth reading, but it is not on my list to read over and over again, like some of my favorites."
5,Great resource for remote temp and power sensing,I have a cottage in northern Michigan of which I do not stay in year round especially in the winter months. I installed the Freeze alarm to keep me informed of any power failure or temperature drop. It is easy to install and setup and make calls for periodic temp and power checks. I plan to add another unit at a different location. Just what you need if you have multiple properties.
2,Battery is NOT INCLUDED,"The Product description says ""battery included""...it is NOT INCLUDED. That is why I did not buy on one Amazon, now will have to go out and pay retail price for one....grrrr."
5,Performs as Advertised,"The price was right, it was easy to setup and no burst pipes this winter -what more could you ask for! There's really nothing bad to say about this unit and it does everything it was described to do."
4,No hesitation,"Works as advertised. Set up not too tricky. Would definitly recc'd for cabin, second home, monitoring backup system. Value for money rated high."
2,Easy to Understand but not very good over all,"Within the first couple of chapters, I noticed that they really need to use spell check! Typos in their own book scared me because Typos are something that is not accepted when coding. Seemed they used the good vs bad relationships and normalization for MySQL, almost same topics as used in the O'Reilly's MySQL/msql book.It was simple to understand though. Beginners should look for other books instead of this!"
4,Great book if looking for examples,I have read many good books on this subject and this is the best one that I have found for examples of applications. This book includes a CD with examples of the projects described in the book. Scripts are easy to install and modify and good starting point for better projects.
1,Too many typos,There are typos everywhere. Often the typos render the code unusable. For the person who is learning these two development tools (which should be the target audience) you can't figure out why the code doesn't work. I hate paying money so that I can be frustrated.
3,Big Disappointment,"Having used 3 guides on our most recent trip to Puerto Rico, Mr.Pariser's is weak in many aspects. Many of his phone numbers are wrong or have a digit missing. You can guess at which places he writes about and probably never saw in person. A lot of his writing needs proofreading as it looks sloppy and unedited. He doesn't describe restaurants in very helpful ways and seems pretty clueless understanding the culture. In fact, he didn't seem to care very much about what underlies today's Puerto Rico- the history, politics, cultural traditions. This book seems more like a journalistic assignment and less like a meaningful undertaking for the author. Pariser brings no passion to the subject."
3,More local maps would be helpful,"I used this map for a weeklong trip around north-central New Mexico, and it was very useful. The layout of the maps is different than any atlas I've used - big improvement there. My main criticism is that, as a ""recreation atlas,"" it should show you more detail around key recreation areas (e.g., Pecos Wilderness). I thought it would be more similar to a Delorme atlas with detailed hiking landmarks (water towers, powerlines, etc.). It'll get you to the entrance and give you some main forest roads, but I would've prefered some more details and close-up relief maps.Overall, it was a good atlas for highway and biway driving, but not the outdoors guide I was looking for."
3,"Good, not great","I bought this Benchmark atlas and the DeLorme New Mexico atlas both back in 2004. So I do not know the current editions of either book, but can say that of the 2004 versions of these, the DeLorme is greatly superior. It simply shows far more information on the maps. The split design of this atlas also baffles me; I find myself only using the ""public lands"" section and totally ignoring the ""landscape"" section. The latter does give a better at-a-glance impression of elevations, but I really need to know where the public lands are and otherwise information is duplicated between the two. I'd much rather have more detail in a single map than two coarser-scaled, mostly redundant maps. Nonetheless, for what it does show I cannot fault this map. I just wish it showed more.If the DeLorme atlas weren't around this would be a must-have; but I have the DeLorme atlas and so this mostly gathers dust."
4,Covers Wide Range of Canine Ailments,"Like other books on homeopathy, this book is best used together with a comprehensive materia medica. It's important to keep in mind that the listed remedies are suggestions only and may or may not fit the individual patient's symptom picture. Having said that, this book covers a wider range of ailments than most books on veterinary homeopathy. The introduction to homeopathy section, however, is very brief and there is little information on taking a case and selecting the correct remedy, so this is not the best book for someone new to homeopathy (check out books by Dr. Don Hamilton or Dr. Christopher Day first).In addition to the guide to canine ailments, there are descriptions of thirteen constitutional types, excerpts from readers' letters, and some interesting essays on veterinary homeopathy including one on homeopathic alternatives to vaccinations."
2,No Green Thumb Here,"I envisioned a field of glorious poppies. I followed the instructions, however, we had a warm spell and the area probably dried out for periods of the day. I dampened the soil each morning and evening. No poppies survived to grow. Such a let down. Not the product, but the gardener. I may try again next year but will have to keep the area wet! Wish me luck."
5,Awesome CD,"Awesome CD by a great 70s rock band from Canada. These 10 songs are great and have a hard rock tune to them including a few instrumental tracks. This might not be there best, but it's still a great CD to own."
5,The classic school ditching movie!,"""Save Ferris"", this was the message pasted and said all over northern Illinois! Ferris Bueller ditches school, picks up his best friend and borrows the friends fathers car (a nice one at that) and picks up his girlfriend to go on a great series of adventures in Chicago.Jeffery Jones (Mr. Rooney) is the school's principal who's being tricked by Ferris Bueller. Mr. Rooney wants to ruin Ferris Bueller for ditching school, but Mr. Rooney doesn't know who he's dealing with!"
1,'Tain't Funny MGee,"This film may have been a hoot when it came out, but Ferris Bueler has since grown up to be the kind of irresponsible stock broker and bank lender who took large chances with other people's money and just four years ago brought the entire economy down around our ears. John Hughes' comedies about over privileged Chicago North Shore teenagers are a relic of the Reagan years that we need to expose for what they are and get down to the serious business of building an economy in which there is a level playing field and financial wrong doers are punished and barred from misleading innocent people.It's difficult to believe that cute little Matthew Broderick who shown in Torch Song Trilogy lend himself to this garbage."
5,10 10 10 10 10,"THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAD EVER SEEN. FERRIS SHOWED HIS HIS FRIEND CAMMERIAN AND HIS GIRFRIEND A GOOD TIME. EVEN THOUGH HE IS A C+ STUDENT HE STILL SHOWS HIS FRIENDS HOW TO ENJOY LIFE (EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO BREAK A RULE HERE AND THERE). I LOVE THE PART WHERE FERRIS STARTS SINGING IN THE PARADE AND THE LOOK ON CAMERON'S FACE WHEN HIS DAD'S CAR GOES RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW. FERRIS PULLS OFF A SCHEME FOR THE ENTIRE MOVIE. HIS SCHEME IS NOT ALL PLANNED. AT THE END HE IS PLAYING IT OFF THE TOP OF HIS HEAD. ALSO ONE VERY HILARIOUS PART WAS WHEN THE PRINCIPAL TRYS TO GET INTO FERRIS' HOUSE BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT FERRIS IS NOT REALLY SICK (BUT FERRIS SISTER HELPED WITHOUT KNOWING). IF YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE SOME OTHER FUNNY MOVIES ALONG THESE LINES ARE FUNNY FARM, ANIMAL HOUSE, AND NATIONAL LAMPOONS CHRISTMAS VACATION. IF YOU GET THIS MOVIE YOU WILL BE IN FOR A BIG TREAT."
2,"Movie Good, Pakaging not as Pictured","The movie I received (Ferris Bueller's Day Off Bluray) had a cut all the way through the front case label and all the way down the case. Seems like it was cut through with a box cutter. Also, the item I received is not the same as what is pictured on the website. The web picture shows a much more elaborate packaging whereas what I received was cheaply made. Just a standard flimsy Blu-ray box with with no insert or extra sleeve."
2,Irritating movie,"This is a film that has bugged the heck out of me for years.Maybe I should give it another shot, but what's to like about a film that glorifies a narcissistic jerk who cuts class, disrespects everyone in his life, and pursues a crazy adventure that you know he's going to get in trouble for?Why exactly do people think this is a classic? If I want this kind of a movie, I'll turn to The Graduate, because at least that film starts out with a sense of restraint. This movie is a set of snapshots of an unsympathetic prodigal son, leaping out of the nest at breakneck speed with flagrant disregard to everything except his own inner pleasure-seeker."
2,A good cast in an annoying movie,"I like Matthew Broderick very much and the other actors here are quite good, too, but this movie is as irritating as they come. It's a ""rich-kid fantasy cartoon"" of a movie, firing at easy targets and reminding me of the many reasons I hated growing up in the comfortable suburbs. If your idea of compelling characters is spoiled, obnoxious brats who think the world owes them everything, help yourself."
5,Awesome,"That word pretty much sums this movie up. It was Matthew Broderick's best, other than Godzilla of course (kidding. Kidding.), but really that's all I can say about it. If you don't have this movie, buy it. If you haven't ever even seen this movie... what's wrong with you?"
5,This is Great American Classic Comedy,"I have seen this movie 20 times, and hope to see it 20 more.Funny, Inspiring, Thought Provoking, it has it all!!Racey enough for the parents, tame enough for the Kids.Get your copy today"
3,pretty good better at the time,I feel that Matthew Broderick did his best work in this film.it was cooler at the time.this film hasn't aged all that well.it was a 80's piece that was solid then but has faded now.
5,DUde ThiS Is SO Coo!,"This movie is way good! youull pry luv Mathew Broderick after seeing this movie, I know I do! It's got some pretty funny parts, Its about a high school senior, Ferris Bueller (Mathew Broderick) who plays sick to get out of school on a perfect day. his best buddy is for real home sick and ferris pryes him out of the bed and they go hang out and bail a girl outta school, and they all go hang out and spend a day off. It's awsome!"
5,In For a Laugh.... no matter what!,This is easily the funniest movie I have ever seen. It's about a very popular High-School boy named Ferris Bueller who wants to take the school day off with a few friends. He goes through extreme difficulties to get this... but the movie is not complete without the evil principle!
3,Mostly good,"I give it three stars because I can't listen to it from afar. I have to get up and move my player to the next disk when it comes to the last two songs. Why the producers put a hip-hop piece and a quasi-disco song ""inspired"" by the movie is beyond me. Aside from that it has great music."
3,Disappointed and I love this musical,"I just got the soundtrack today and am kind of disappointed with the CD because it lacks the original play's funny sense of humor plus missing are some great songs not included in the film.If you are going to adapt a musical play, please use all the songs as they are all needed to incorporate the story.I have seen the movie three times and highly recommend the film but felt cheated that the some songs from the show are deleted.However everyone sounds good enough, but if you want the real thing, get the cast show album instead.It is soooooooo much better. The movie however is very sexy and hot. The men are especially sexy dancers, which makes this boy happy."
1,sad ending of a cd that started out great,i was very disappointed in the cd. it started out great but there was no reason to put in all the hip hop music at the end.the ending of the cd was bad. i would not recommend this cd to anyone.
2,not as good as Moulin Rouge,"now, this was a story written a long time ago. but it still falls flat. the songs are unemotional and stupid. the beats are too modern, now sounding like something that was trying to be a hip CD. the music was supposed to sound old and untouched. the lyrics can be funny, but are not top noch. if you need to listen to a good musical, listen to Moulin Rouge. Moulin Rouge was much better than Chicago. Chicago, in my opinion, was just trying too hard..."
1,WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?,By far the worst soundtrack i've ever listened to. Even if you liked the music in the film you will be tortured by the sounds on this CD
4,This CD is worth the money!,"I got this CD yesturday and I've been listening to it ever since. The first track is awesome to get you in that '20s mood. The rest of the CD is excellent too, but it's the first track that reels you in and gets you set for the whole CD! The ""Cell Block Tango"" and ""We both Reached for the Gun"" are the best on the disc. The feel of this CD makes me feel like I'm back in New Orleans or New York during the 20s (Yes, I know it happens in Chicago), and the whole album is just fantastic!But if you haven't seen the movie, ""Funny Honey"" and ""We both Reached for the Gun"" might seem a bit odd to you, you might not understand what's going on. But I won't spoil it, I'll let you see it. It's a great movie and an awesome soundtrack!"
4,decent recording,"I really enjoyed this album, though I think I do like the 1996 cast a tad better but the actors have decent voices and I have to give them credit for doing their own singing. My favorite track is ""Cell Block Tango""."
4,Chicago CD,It has great music from the Chicago Movie that I love to play over and over. The only weird thing about it is Queen Latifa's strange remix on the end of the CD. I let the CD play till then and then push skip. It's too close to Rap style for me.
4,A KNOCKOUT!,"This is truly an outstanding version of the classic Kander/Ebb score. Catherine Zeta-Jones' rendition of ""All That Jazz"" is second best only to the amazing Chita Rivera [the original Velma]. Renee Zellweger does an excellent job with ""Roxie"", I can't bear listening to Ann Reinking's rendition from the 1996 revival. Richard Gere shines most with ""Razzle Dazzle"" and Queen Latifah socks it to you with ""When You're Good To Mama"". I could have lived without the hip-hop version of ""Cell Block Tango"" and Anastacia's ""Love is A Crime"", which was ""inspired"" by the film.Luckily these two tracks are at the very end so my CD's laser lens will never go there. This CD will find a permanent place in my CD shelf alongside the legendary Original Broadway Cast Recording. If you loved this movie BUY IT you will not be disappointed."
5,Just Awesome!,"Wow!! I'm fan and I just can say it's supercool!........Jazz,dance,coreography,music,lyrics, voices, wow!!!! everything ..."
1,"What a wretched, wretched movie","I watched ""The Others"" immediately before I watched ""Wendigo,"" and I was struck by the differences. Both films rely upon atmosphere, not gore, to provide their chills, and The Others proves that a good scary movie doesn't have to look as though it was shot in an abattoir to make the viewer squirm. HOWEVER, a good scary movie does have to scare you, or alarm you, or at least leave you feeling vaguely unsettled. There is not a solid ""gasp"" moment anywhere to be found in Wendigo. The movie is pretentious, pointless, and worst of all...DULL. The only thing I felt at the end of the movie was pity for Patricia Clarkson, whom I like as an actress. Please do not waste your money on this film."
2,looked like a college film project,"The Wendigo is an odd film. It has a few good things going for it. The child actor playing Miles is excellent and Patricia Clarkson as the high strung mom is the best of the adult actors. Her character starts out as the kind of city person you love to hate but she later shows great strength and devotion to her family.Now for what's wrong. Wendigo looks like a a college film projects. It's poorly edited, looks like it was shot on cheap film and and the special effects are pathetic. On top of all this there is entirely too much talking. Conversations go on forever. I mean it. The whole movie comes to a stand still while one character does a monolouge. By the time the six armed deer man shows up I didn't care anymore."
4,Not for Everyone,"Larry F's films are not for everyone. I was expecting more out of Wendigo, but I was not dissapointed. Mr. Fesseden's films deal with the monster inside of us all, the darker side of humanity. I own this DVD along with No Telling, and I recommend them both. I do understand that this film does not suit everyone's tastes.I liked it and would recommend it."
3,Great Promise - Big Letdown,"Ahh... this movie could've been something really special. After a strong opening in which a city family hit a deer on a snowy country road, the film slowly starts a downward spiral to an unsatisfying conclusion.The story borrows a little too heavily from King's ""The Shining"". The boy(Erik Per Sullivan, in a very good performance) encounters people who don't exist in the material world and has premonitions of the horrors to come.When we finally do see the Wendigo, the f/x are disappointingly primitive. I know this film didn't have the biggest budget, but I've seen school plays with more convincing special effects.I gave this film 3 stars. The acting was slightly above average and the plot had a ton of potential. As it stands, ""Wendigo"" is watchable and better than a lot of the junk horror movie of late. But it could have(and should have) been a real gem."
4,SOME RARE GOOD MEXICAN COMEDY...,"The main plot in this movie is going round on a new couple incidents to became an ""appropriate"" family (half necessity, half consumerism). But moreover the plot, there are some great performances (not so usual for mostly TV actors)and you'll find many subtle and smart critics to the way the middle-level workers where forced to addapt to the new ""productivity models"" at the eighties.Always enjoyable, this is a must-see mexican comedy."
4,"great, but wrong mount","This is a great sight, but i cant fit it on my rails because the mount is too small. My rail is a weaver/pitcany or whatever, but the mount is much smaller, like that on a daisy airgun. so, not ideal for sirsoft unless you buy the right rings."
2,scope,terrible mounting system cheap scope all it is is plastic and you cant sight it in pretty much a fail i just have it for looks
5,An Interesting R,This is another gruesome tale of a nice young man gone off the deep end. The story is well told and interesting; almost makes one feel sorry for the guy.
5,The Night Stalker: The Truth,"The Night Stalker: The Life And Crimes Of Richard Ramirez Is Simply One If Not The Greatest Book I Have Ever Read. As Said, It Grips You From Begging To End, Its Like A Sick Roller Coaster, You Hate What He's Doing And Going On, But Then You Cant Help But Feel Sorry For Him, His Childhood, The Way He Grew Up, His Influences, His Enviroment, You Have To Factor Everything In To See What Makes Him Tick, Again This Book Is Pure Genius, Described Very Well, And Just Simply One Of The Best Books About Someone Besides A Biography."
5,A must for every true crime reader,"The Night Stalker is one of the best true crime books that I have read. Philip Carlo gives the reader well researched details of Richard Ramirez's crimes as well as his life, describing what events led up to and may have caused him to commit the violent crimes that he did. His family and their daily struggles are also described as they try to support a family member, who is also a serial killer, while trying to cope with what he has done. The Night Stalker is a must read for every true crime reader!"
2,Awful!,"Pointless, with annoying characters. The one character I did like, Maggie, was completely WASTED! Williams did nothing with her, which was a sin since she's a great character. Read A streetcar named desire if you want a good play by williams."
4,Good,Arrived on time. The only disappointing factor was that the cover was not the same a the picture on the listing. In good condition.
4,"Finally, Fury in his own book!","Will Murray has written an enjoyable romp with Nick Fury and his agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. teaming up (albeit briefly) with their foes of Hydra to prevent a madman bent on world destruction. Murray doesn't disappoint fans with his characterizations of the main characters, and the many fun toys that S.H.I.E.L.D. has at their fingertips. The beginning alone is straight from a James Bond movie.I would love to see Murray return, I loved his works on The Destroyer novel series and comics run, and very much enjoyed the adventures of Nick Fury in this new millenium. If presented right, Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. could be the James Bond or Man from U.N.C.L.E.Nick Fury fans, buy this book! Adventure fans who like a bit of ""suspension of disbelief"" in their reading, won't be disappointed."
5,OUTSTANDING !!!!,"This is an incredible album from a band in which every single member has served in the Army. Their songs can be appreciated by anybody who has ever served in a combat zone(and understands Rusian of course), regardless of the flag under which they served. Highly recommended."
1,Poor excuse for a remake,Adam Sandler once again proves himself the unfunniest man on the planet(with the possible exception of Jimmy Fallon).This film asks you to believe that Adam Sandler could pass for a NFL quaterback?What next?David Spade as a heavyweight boxer?And Chris Rock(great at standup) still can't act a lick.Rent the original.
5,Five stars out of a hundred!,"Do you like to laugh? Well you're going to need to strap yourself in and throw away the key to get through this movie. Otherwise, you'll be reaching for the remote about 90 seconds in. It's true that I might be the world's biggest Adam Sandler fan. It's also true that I lie to get attention. What I am trying to say is that Adam Sandler and Chris Rock = hijinks. Hijinks that come not in the form of laughter or delight, but in a knowing nod to each other that the paycheck they're getting for thisis bigger than the annual adjusted gross export $$ of Thailand. So, prepare for a joyride of comic proportions, but know that that preparation will serve no real purpose because this film is weaker than Calista Flockhart at bench press competition. However, it's still better than 50 First Dates, so put that in your shoe and step in it."
4,"Good, entertaining , and funny...","Not a typical Adam Sandler movie as for his character-he's not his typical Billy Madison, Happy Gilmour-self but it is still a funny movie. The reoccurring McDonald's ""cheeseburger"" character was hilarious. If a wrestling fan you will notice 3 wrestlers in it-Stone Cold Steve Austin, Goldberg, and Kevin Nash. The football game was action packed. Besides being funny it was 100% entertaining and well worth the admission. The movie itself was about 2 hours long and not being a big fan of MTV itself they did do a great job of making this movie."
3,Not too funny,"The Longest Yard is advertized as a comedy, but it's not that funny. You have to get half way through the movie to get the laughs (most come from a cameo) Hoping for more coming for great comedians like Rock and Sandler."
3,Funny and entertaining,"This is a very fun and enjoyable film to watch. I have not seen the original, but people that have seen it say they prefer the remake over it. I must say that this may be more liked by Adam Sandler fans, so if you can't stand him or find him unfunny, odds are you won't find this film a delight.Chris Rock really shines as the Caretaker. He gives a funny and well-acted performance. One thing I wished I'd see more of was more screen time for the professional wrestlers (Kevin Nash, Steve Austin, Bill Goldberg) in the movie. They would've played well for a movie about tough cell mates and guards.Overall, this is a fun football movie. If you like Sandler movies and good raunchy (guy) humor, give this one a shot."
4,Do You Know this Penelope Cruz?,"Pedro Almodovar's fourth film with Penélope Cruz is not as strong as earlier work but well worth viewing. To see Cruz act using her native language you realize her breadth and depth. Consider viewing all of the Almondovar/Cruz films but if only one more, select Volvar. Because it is a DVD it, fortunately, arrived with no damage during the transit."
2,"It does its job, but...","We bought this to use as a bassinet in our room so later down the road we could use it to travel with. At first it worked really well. But I had a couple problems with it.- After breaking it down, we had a hard time getting the sides to stay up.- The mattress warps. It doesn't lay flat in the bassinet.- The changer is at a awkward level for me. When I change him it hurts my back. (I'm 5'2)- My son loves vibration attachment but it will turn on on its own and shorts out.- The timer isn't long enough. Even if I select the longest time for the vibration, it only seems to last about 3 or 4 minutes."
4,Very impressed!,"I am very impressed with this item. The colors are great. Even my very picky parents were pleasantly suprised at how nice it is in quality, as well as, aesthetically. Only issue I have with it is I wont be able to use it as a portable since it is too wide to fit through the doorways and its a pain to open and close again."
4,"Great deal, decent sound for the size","When I put one pair of these in my cart, the price was below the $25 needed for free shipping and the shipping was $20. So how to do better? Order two pairs!I used them for outdoor speakers. I replaced my big clunky 80s speakers indoor with the second pair; they make decent bookshelf speakers. The sound was much better than I expected for the size. They're no Bose speakers, but the quality/$ ratio is much better!I did have one problem that would have made me mad if I didn't get lucky fixing it. One of the 4 speakers was DOA. But I just took off the terminal strip in back and a wire was unplugged from the inside; I could fish it out with a wire and a dental mirror. A quick fix. I wasn't offended; the nearest comparable offering anywhere was easily 2x the price. It was easier than returning them."
2,Not enough info for non-electronically minded people.,"So I was really excited that I thought I got such a good price on speakers for my computer. Little did I know that I was expected to buy more products to be able to actually use them! No where in the product review or customer reviews did I find anything that said I wouldn't be able to use this right out of the box. It comes with a set of wires with no adapters to plug into anything to actually use them! I don't know if I can put one on the end or not, but I may be returning them.Don't buy these if you don't want any hassle!"
1,Christy Lane's Party Dances dvd,Received this dvd with a scratch on it and could never view it. It was brand new and sealed. Not happy!!
2,Not quite what I expected,"I thought the instructor (Christy Lane) was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but I thought the dance instruction would include going through the dance with the associated music. Instead, the instructor goes through the dance moves slowly, then she goes through them at regular speed, then she does a (very) short run through to music. Granted, some steps (eg. Electric Slide) are not complicated, but I guess I was expecting more time to be spent on each separate dance."
3,great dvd but needs aids,"This is a wonderful dvd. Christy breaks down the dances in a way that anyone can understand. I am an elementary P.E. teacher and in order to use the dances in my classroom, I have to learn the dances, buy the cd that has all the music and teach the dance myself. Christy only does a 30 second blurb of each song and dance. Therefore this video is not a workout without the cd and your own practice."
1,absolutely don't buy this,"I bought this to treat my two cats for fleas yesterday, but ended up bathing both of them after one of them started acting weak and just off. Today she is lethargic and vomiting, and both cats have the fur on the backs of their necks coming off in spots, over the entire application area. I contacted my vet and she said she has seen cats killed by the toxicity of Hartz flea and tick products, and that she would never recommend them to anyone. I may have to have the cat who's vomiting sedated and put on iv fluids to try and push this out of her system if she doesn't improve by tomorrow morning. This product is poison, and Hartz should be ashamed of themselves for knowingly selling something this dangerous. I will absolutely never buy any of their products again."
1,Beware!!!,"The are a lot of warnings about this product making both cats & dogs sick or worse yet dying, check the internet for reviews & warnings. I bought this product but threw away. I read the warnings after purchasing."
5,PERFECT FIT & EASY TO INSTALL,"This bedrail fits perfect on my daughters twin/trundle bed! Her bed sits against wall so needed just one bedrail. This one does the job, folds down easily to allow you to make bed, etc. She's never fallen out of bed or had any problems. Started sleeping in ""big bed"" with bedrail at 22months."
3,For Jame's Mommy,"This is in response to James Mommy. We found this bedrail at Wal-mart under Parent's choice just last night. I believe it is the same thing. However, it is not found on their web page. just in the store."
5,"Gorgeous photography, fleeting moments captured.","The wonderful thing about the photos in this book is that they are not staged or posed. Consequently, the photographer has managed to capture many fleeting moments of intimacy between his subjects. Beautiful, erotic, and somehow a touch of innocence -- that's how I'd sum this one up."
3,Are you a fan?,"I got my SACD player in 2008 and this was the first of two discs i got.I guess its OOP now so the price has gone up. My local Best buy had a little section that was dumping the SACDs,DTS and DVD-As they had. I got a bargin at 14.99. I am not crazy about the way the disc was mixed, but feel the SACD format superior to standard CDs.If you are a fan of Meatloaf,and have SACD its a nice addition to your library. The disc is becoming scarce and you better get it soon if you want it.The curretnt price is a little to steep for me. Glad i got it when I did!P.S The bonus Live tracks are petty sweet too!"
5,UNBELIEVABLE,"This was my first SACD and, after listening, I can say it will certainly not be my last. Truly an amazing format which gives increased depth to an already extraordinary production. I've already got several more on order from Amazon (Blow By Blow, Dark Side of the Moon, Every Breath You Take etc.). Looking forward to enjoying my ""new"" listening experience.""Don't let your Meat Loaf"""
2,Two Out of Three Ain't Bad - I suppose,"Of the three songs released as singles from this album, two of them ""Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad,"" and ""You Took The Words Out Of My Mouth,"" can still manage to garner attention in a kind of embarrassed to admit you like them kind of way. The third, ""Paradise By The Dashboard Light"" is just plain tacky.The rest of ""Bat Out of Hell"" is a mixed bag, with little, if any, of it really holding up some 20 years later as terribly compelling. It served its purpose at the time I suppose, and for that we can be grateful. But to be honest, I can't imagine this serving today as anything other than nostalgia. For that reason, the division this seems to be creating among reviewers is quite fascinating."
1,"It's 2003, People!","Unbelievably overblown, melodramatic, and pompous in the extreme this album could only have been made and released in the 70's. As a (laughable) time capsule from that era it actually almost works, but as music it is nothing short of dreadful. Anyone who finds this stuff interesting needs to get out more."
5,bat out of hell,one of the greatest ever. it has hit after hit on it. easy to listen to and easy to sing-a-long
4,"The ""original Meatloaf""",I've always enjoyed Meatloaf's music and Bat Out Of Hell was no exception. I have heard either Bat Out Of Hell 2 or 3 and did like one of them better but I have yet to really look for for it. I would suggest that you try and listen to the samples of 2 and 3 before buying this album. Of course I am enjoying this album but I'm pretty sure one of the others might be better.
5,All Time Best CD,"I have listened to this particular album on record (LP), 8 track tape, audio cassette, and now I want it on CD. My all around favourite! Best thing for Spring Fever, the blues, or just want to get ""attitude""..."
1,Diappointed,"I was really disappointed. I wanted the EXACT same album I had on my cassette. However, they messed it up by putting some new cuts on it and they had terrible themes that I found really distasteful.The first Bat Out of Hell is one of my all time favorites, so needless to say, I was not happy."
1,Horrendous,"cThe songs are pretentious, over the top drivel, the singing overwrought, over emotive, and pompous, and the production is shrill, bombastic and self-indulgent. It might be tempting to simply dismiss this criticism given that this was released in the 1970's, after all, but such doesn't was. 1978 was indeed a superb year in music given such great albums by the likes of The Clash (""Give 'Em Enough Rope"") Elvis Costello (""This Year's Model""), Patti Smith (""Easter""), The Ramones (""Road to Ruin""), Bruce Springsteen (""Darkness at the Edge of Town""), and others. An anomaly on an absolute nadir in popular culture. Maybe both."
3,"Good music, poor recording quality","I really enjoy the music, but the recording quality is poor. I have heard better reproductions of the same songs on the internet."
4,"Good book, but only for advanced learners","This book is strongly recommended only if you are an advanced learner (both in English and in phonetics) and you are looking for a book that helps you to achieve native-like competence in English pronunciation. Note that the book focuses on Received Pronunciation (that is the most prestigious variety spoken in the UK), and only somewhat cursory references are made to other pronunciations (like General American). Note also that sound knowledge of phonetics is required because you might not agree with the author on some issues, such as how he deals with English accentuation."
5,a classic,"ok, so Elizete doesn't sing with the uninflected style of the bossa nova singers the rest of the world knows - see last review. it doesn't matter. her vocal style is marvelous, her appetite for the music is infectious, and her interpretations are delicious. this album is great in the same way that the Tom and Elis album is great - wonderful talent soaring over, and taking pleasure in, the music being performed."
1,Disappointed,"I can't tell you if the content of this title is any good or not. I couldn't get it to play. Just a few still images, a few menus that didn't get me very far, and some faint background music. I can play other DVD video (movies) OK on my PC on WMP, but not this. I don't have a separate DVD player so I don't know what the performance might be on such a unit.On this basis I cannot recommend this title. Very disappointing. :-|"
1,Horrible product support,"I bought this camera for my daughter. It worked okay (my only complaint is that there is no audio playback for the audio, and the audio sounded really bad when played back on a computer). But then my daughter lost the battery door that covers the batteries and SD memory slots. It's just a little plastic slide in door...probably costs $0.01 to produce. But after spending many hours wasting time with HP's horrible customer support I now know that they will not sell me the part at any price. So my $80 camera is nearly worthless (yeah, we can use scotch tape to hold the batteries in). Anyway, the door is prone to fall off and get lost and HP isn't interested in solving the problem because there isn't enough $$$ in it for them. So don't buy it."
1,Junky plastic trash,"This camera is a piece of junk. I knew the moment I took it out of the packaging and held it in my hands. It feels like it could break any moment. It is not solidly constructed, the only weight comes from the two AA batteries you put in.Also be aware- It has no real zoom. The 5x optical zoom it has is the ONLY zoom in the camera.It was extremely difficult to get a photo that was not blurry out of this thing.It is cheap for a digital camera, but worth only $20 in terms of quality. I am taking it back to the store tomorrow."
4,Great collection of Anthrax tunes... but...,"This is a killer collection of the best of Anthrax new and old. It has two killer re-mixes, but the ONLY problem I have with the album is that ""I'm The Man"" is the RADIO-FRIENDLY version! Given all the past ""anti-censorship"" statements of Anthrax (check out ""Startin' Up a Posse"" on ""Attack of the Killer B's""), I think it was a very bad move on behalf of the band to put the censored version of one of their most fun songs! That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. But, if you don't mind that slight oversight, then order this album now!"
4,Music for masses!,"Great stuff from great musicians...this CD is loaded with memorable tunes. The original tunes make you want to shake the dust off your boots and hit the repeat button. And, check out Miss Darlene's version of ""You Tried to Ruin my Name"" - instant classic!!!"
5,Great book!,"I love the world Eisenstein has created here, one where nature and magic interact, and where demons have their own worlds far from the call of man. It is one of the few books that I can start rereading as soon as I finish the last page, because it is always new and refreshing to me!"
5,Nice smooth comb,"Yes, $25 Is a lot for a comb but if you want to grow your hair you should never brush it wet and a good comb it essential to prevent breakage. I would definitely recommend this comb. I also have the bristle/nylon brush and they are both worth every penny."
1,Horrible quality,"I have been using Mason Pearson's bristle/nylon brush for over a year, and it has been great. I wanted a comb for my shower so I bought this one. In less than 10 times use (not even a month), the middle tooth broke off. I have fine hair that gets tangled easily. However, my hair is very manageable, and a $3 plastic comb I had before this one worked fine for over a year. Based on the reviews I read, I expected the comb to last for many years. Perhaps the comb I received was defective. Regardless, I am very upset that $25 was wasted."
1,Not what I'd expect from Braun.,"I am sorry, but I cannot share the enthusiasm for this product. The readings are innacurate - several readings taken at short intervalls showed deviations of up to 2.5 degrees. To prove this, I repeated the test on myself with the same results. This is very critical since most doctors recommend a visit to the emergency room if the child's temperature exceeds 105. With this thermometer there is - at least for me - no accurate way of telling.In addition, the button that activates the reading process gets stuck a lot, thereby producing no result at all. I finally replaced it with a professional model, the same kind that doctors use. Expensive, but worth it.I am usually a fan Of Braun products. Not this one!"
5,"A ""must have"" for your baby!","We decided to buy this product despite being told that only rectal thermometer is accurate for infants. Nevertheless, knowing the usual high quality of Braun products, we gave it a try and are very happy about it!It's one of the best investments we've ever made. We loved the following features:- You do not disturb the baby and can measure the temperature even if the baby is asleep;- The result is displayed in 2 seconds;- Very ergonomic;- With an easy used lens filter ejector, can be used for the whole family.The thermometer has a convenient feature of switching between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales. Also, if you need more than 1 temperature measurement stored in the memory, you can consider Braun IRT 4520 - it saves 8 readings.Excellent gift, especially for baby shower!"
2,Teamwork. . . detailed,"MacMillan's text helps readers see the benefits of working in a team oriented environment. The Performace Factor is nothing to write home about and doesn't really shed new light on the academic discussion of administration. If you are new to the concept, then maybe this text is for you, but if you are well read in the field, this will probably only be interesting as far as the story of the airplane crash is concerned."
1,Premature Wear,"Am I the only one having this problem? These foils aren't lasting me more than a few months. And, no, I don't push the razor hard against my face, I use it at a 90 degree angle, and I don't have an abnormally thick beard. I've used Braun razors my whole life and for some reason my 8595 goes through foils like nothing else. I've even had the entire cutter unit (motor) replaced under warrenty just in case that was the problem. Personally I think the problem is in the design of the foil as the thinner mesh just isn't as strong as the previous design. Is anyone else having this same experience? Is the newer 360 model any better?"
4,Like having a new razor,"Well, I've had the Braun 8595 for about 18 months now, so thought it was time to change the cutterblock and foil. Didn't think it was going to make a difference, but boy, it certainly did. Recommend it - even if you clean the thing every day, it makes a lot of difference to the cut."
3,"Good, but better value is to get a refurbished unit with new foil","I had my 8585 razor for about 2 years and needed to replace the foil and block. I saw they were selling them here for $30. I also saw they have refurbished 8585's for $59. I think for an extra $29 I'd like to have the security of having an extra razor (eg. use for travel) or if the battery or motor dies on one, I can use the other. Anyway, that's my $.02"
1,Finally shipped,"I had the same experience as the fellow who wrote the July '06 review. I ordered the part in the first week of May '06 to only have it delayed 3 times for shipment. I just got another delay notice from Amazon today, July 10. At this rate they'll never ship the item.If they can't ship, why in the world do they list this item???UPDATE: Amazon finally shipped the product after the 3rd delay. Replacing the screen/cutter restores the shaver to like-new performance. Overall I find the Activator to give a decent shave with minor irritation. Using a William's Lectric Shave helps even more by reducing irritation to nearly zero, lightly lubes the screen/cutter and keeps the screen reasonably cool to the touch. My previous screen did last about 19 months so the longevity (in my case) is excellent."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS REPLACEMENT,"I never thought I'd say anything bad about my Braun 8585 shaver, but the replacement foils and cutterblock have ruined a wonderful product.Here's what happened....I used my original blades and foil for 2 to 3 years. The shaver gave me a GREAT shave. Then I replaced those blades with replacement foil and cutterblock. What a mistake! Apparently Braun was bought out by Gillette in 2005. Gillette changed the design of the blades and moved the manufacture of them to China. Well, now blades that are supposed to last 18 months only last 2-3 months. They are HORRIBLE.I am so frustrated because it now takes me 3 times as long to shave and the results are just terrible. The shaver is cutting my face and not my hair. Yesterday, I ordered a Panasonic shaver because I can't afford to replace the blades every 2-3 months and get a crappy shave.I used to love this shaver. What a shame."
4,Outstanding book if you're a proficient VB developer,"This book is for those people that use VB quite a bit and already know most of the product. It fills in the gaps quickly. It seems a bit light though in the Data/ADO/MTS sections for the distributed exams (but I have not taken that exam yet, just practice ones)."
4,Bad paper cover but good in content,"The paper cover is bad, not well glued to the paper. However, I bought this book as it has high star rating and I find it so. Then, I agree with others who gives high rate but I truly disagree with the quality of paper cover finishing."
1,Not Much Help For Exam--You have been WARNED!!,"I read the book from cover to cover twice. I went thru all the questions 3 times. There were some good examples and a lot of info, but this book was of almost no use for the 70-175 Exam. At most it helped me answer about 5 questions of the 71 on the Exam. The exam questsions were just very different from what was in this book. I also read a different 70-175 prep book, and the other one I used was of little use as well."
4,Use this book and no other,"I just passed my second VB exam based on the strength of this book and my previous experience. I strongly recommend this book to any VB programmer studying for the two VB exams. It will ground you in all of the areas the exams test you on.That said, I would have given this book 5 stars, but the occasional typo was problematic in the sample tests. I have a first printing so hopefully O'Reilly will continue to correct all the mistakes found. Remember to check the O'Reilly website for the latest errata (I wish more book publishers would be this honest)."
2,Something went wrong,"Well,I'm really sad to say that I just understood nothing about the movie.I tried the subtitle in English,but it didn't work.I speak neither Russian nor Polish,so...By the way, my deal with the shop was ok. It is NOT their fault.They delivered the good on due time and answered all my doubts."
1,Turbocharge? Depends on your interpretation of the word.,"As a marketing communications practitioner, I too was impressed with Vitale's web site, and agree that some of his online tips are quite useful and insightful. However, Vitale's ""instant writing method,"" described in Turbocharge Your Writing, isn't really insightful or new. This book tells you what to do to get started on your writing project. If you already know that you need to organize your thoughts pre-writing, and that you need to write and re-write, and that you need to step away from, and then return to your work with a fresh view, then you don't need this. If you're hoping to find suggestions for enlivening or punching up your writing, I'd try one of Vitale's other books. However, if you're completely (and I mean, completely) new to the writing practice, maybe this will help you get started."
4,"Good history, but buy Rheingold's book","This book makes a nice thorough reference of the history of computing post 1945, and is great for use on a course. However it is a little dry and unanalytical. Buy Howard Rheingold's ""Tools for thought"" if you want a generally more human, enjoyable read which provides almost as good a technical account."
4,Indigo Ocean Dreams,"I was slightly disappointed that the stories were a mirror of Indigo Dreams, but my 8 yr. old son prefers it and listens to it every night at bedtime. When I get angry, he usually tells ME to listen to the ""Angry Octopus"" !!! A great cd for both parents and grandparents."
3,Recommended to us by my daughter's therapist,"My 4yo's child psychologist recommended this CD for her. She hates it! She doesn't like to listen to the narrator. SHe would rather just listen to soothing music for meditating. My 7yo, on the other hand, enjoys it very much and asks to listen to one of the meditations often. it really depends on the child whether or not they'll like it. My older daughter is a hyper chatter-box, and my 4yo is very quiet and introspective. one complaint i have is that the CD is very short and i feel we didn't get a fair value."
2,Average material,"It looks as if the bad boys of the 1980s are not as bad as they once seemed, or has the level of badness just skyrocketed and left Camisa de Venus behind? For sure, the things that Camisa de Venus (the Brazilian word for condom) sing about are as risque as could be aired on the radio in the mid-1980s (rape, kidnap, murder, domestic violence, cheating etc.), but with a mild rockabilly style more typical of Raul Seixas-era Brazilian rock, Camisa de Venus fails to rock. Furthermore, on this live CD, one that is a collection of their best songs, the producers failed to include the song ""Deus me de Grana"" (God, give me dough- as in money). They can do better than that."
3,"Not essential, but still a good book.","As a huge fan of the film Howl's Moving Castle, I was delighted to see this book being sold so cheap here on Amazon. The book is hardback, and overall, well presented.My only complaint with the book is that the majority of it only contains stills from the film. They look great, of course, but I was hoping there would be more concept work, as well as pages dedicated to just backgrounds, as they were some of the most beautiful ones I had ever seen in an animated film.In a nutshell: A good book with some beautiful art, which is cheap, though it contains mainly stills from the film, not a lot of concept work."
5,A great book,"Hayao Miyazaki is a genious. This book is simply a must for all of the director's fans. The book is full of drawings, sketches and images from the actual movie."
5,wonderful,Got this for my girlfriend as a present and she loves Howl's Moving Castle.She was extremely pleased with the book and a good addition to her book collection. The product arrived on time and in great condition.
5,LA PANDILLA: EXCELENCIA Y CALIDAD EN CADA CANCION!,"Si quieres lo mejor, este es uno de los Cds que no puede faltar en tu coleccion porque sencillamente es: un CLASICO. La calidad de este grupo se impone en cada una de sus canciones. Antes del grupo Menudo, Los Chicos, Los Chamos, Kabah, OV7 y todos los demas, estaba y esta LA PANDILLA, porque sin mucho alarde y fanfarria demuestra la calidad que solo un grupo como ellos puede dar. Que esperas? Comprate tu cede y disfruta la excelencia!"
4,Excellent Introduction to Windows 2003 Server,"Don Jones deserves applause for clearly covering all the major areas of the vast Windows Server 2003 package in this easy-to-handle book. It steers the middle course between the vast ""Mastering <topic>"" tomes, and the near-useless ""Dummies"" approach. It lives up to its promise of teaching you what you need to know to start setting up and managing a Windows 2003 server with about 15 hours of investment in reading time.The only thing keeping it from getting a full five stars was that it went a bit too briskly over DNS, where I get the feeling a couple more pages of Jones' on-the-mark advice could have saved me some hours of troubleshooting. On the whole, however, a very useful book."
3,Little Relevant Info from a programmer's perspective,"If you buy a server with Windows 2003 Server R2 pre-installed, there is very little you need to do in order to get it up and running as a web/apps server. As such, the book, while very clear, has joined my legions of forgottable IT books. It's not bad, it's just not filled with enough info to make it a must have. I supposed it allowed me to feel better that I wasn't alone in my configuration."
1,Missing in Action,"I love head banging music from the '80's, so when I saw what was listed on Disc 1 and Disc 2, I thought I was getting some really good music for $17.98. And it would have been, too, if Disc 2 was part of the deal. They kinda left that one out of there for some reason. So be warned, if you order this, you're paying all that money for Disc 1 ONLY. Don't get suckered the way I did. Guess where mine is going? Back to Amazon! What a misleading rip off! A huge disappointment."
5,JFC Suxs but they Rock so hard!,JFC Is awesome weather you have seen them at shows or but this cd you'll love them..So buy it now!! you'll be happy=)
1,Slowest Running Shoe Ever,"I was told that this was the fastest running shoe ever. But when I compared them to Nike's models, they were clearly inferior.Overall -- slowest running shoe ever."
5,Great shoes for running,"Love these shoes. I only buy Asics. For my feet, they have always felt the best. These shoes are great. Very comfortable and easy to run in as soon as I put them on. Well worth the money!"
5,success without timewasting,"I have had a different series Asics gel kayano that fit me perfectly and were my most comfortable pair of trainers ever. Sadly my old faithfuls were seriously in need of replacement but what to do as local shops did not stock either my size or any Kayanos. I figured that I had nothing to lose by just ordering these XII series ones. They fit the bill perfectly.I'm so happy as this is the first time I have ever bought a pair of shoes without trying them on first and without enduring long shopping journeys and searches for The Right Trainers. Better yet,they are nice looking, as well as great to work out in."
5,Scooby Doo Meets the Boo Brothers,the best of the Scooby Doo clasic movies has all the hi-jinx you expect of the fraidy two-some without all the monster snacks you normally expect. The ghost busters who are real ghosts themselves are like the three stooges and the riddles of the treasure hunt makes it fun for the whole family.
5,A basic review from a big fan!,"This is a great movie. In my opinion, it is the best full-length Scooby-Doo movie ever made. It has every thing needed to be a great film, including comedy, a great plot, and a great mystery. I have seen almost every scooby-doo episode and movie every made, but I have never grown tired of watching this movie. I would recomend it to anyone who likes Scooby-Doo."
2,OKish. It's just an anthology of other books.,All Bernbaum has done is to read other people's books and string together their ideas. There's very little that's new here.It's all been done before
1,Beware if STEALx,"I bought this item because the price was good and its only rating was 5 stars. Unfortunately I left on a trip and missed the return window by one day! The description is accurate but incomplete. Missing is the fact it won't clamp items less than about 3/4 of an inch thickSteelex D2192 10-Inch Drill Press Clamp. It could if the adjuster screw was 1/4"" longer. Additionally the screw is not a standard metric or american. China strikes again!!Steelex D2192 10-Inch Drill Press Clamp"
1,A waste of time,"This book was absolutely pathetic. For anyone seeking any understanding of Crazy Horse, Lakota culture, the history of the American West, look elsewhere. I find it hard to believe that anyone would publish such a flimsy and insubstantial piece of writing. This book contributes absolutely nothing to our understanding of Native Americans or of our history.What an insult to the intelligence of any reader."
2,bloodless and frightened,"What was wrong with Mr. McMurtry here? This book has no blood in its veins. He circles Lakota culture without entering into it. He seems more curious than anything else. If you want to know about Crazy Horse, read Ambrose. If you want to know about the Lakota world view, read Neither Wolf nor Dog by Nerburn. McMurtry should stick to cowboys, which he does better than almost anyone else. Crazy Horse didn't want to be photographed. Maybe he didn't want to be written about either."
3,Carrie from Kansas,I read this book for an English class. I thought that it was a kind of interesting to read about the different stories about Crazy Horse.It gave alot of interesting information about him. For someone who hasn't ever really been exposed to stuff like that I found it rather interesting.
1,A snooze,"I am a great McMurtry fan (Lonesome Dove, etc.). I also generally like the Penguin Lives books. But this is the worst McMurtry book and the worst Penguin Lives biography I've read. It seems shallow, completely lacking in energy and narrative drive."
3,Guy Reel thought they were guilty,"This book is detailed about the event. It doesn't read very well, but it certainly gives you a feel for the type of people who were involved in this case.I know the roommate of Guy Reel's girlfriend from the time he was writing the book. She told me that Guy Reel said he though the three boys convicted of the crime were guilty. Keep that in mind while reading this book."
4,Story that will shock you!,"When I began reading this book, I had the mind set that this is a true story, that what happened was true, and justice was again served. About 1/4 of the way through the book, I began to feel sick. I just kept thinking ""Oh my, these kids are innocent!"" For a book that is supposed to be showing you WHY and HOW Jessie, Jason, and Damien killed these kids, I was not seeing that. The facts are the facts, and the facts were telling me this was very, very wrong. I asked a few other people to read the book and give me their opinions, just to see if they came to the same conclusion I did, and they did. Anyone who wants to see how sick and corrupt AMERICAN JUSTICE can be, then read this book.I promise, once you do, you will have a need to do anything you can to support these boys and get them out of prison, and find the REAL killers!!"
2,Just about the rarest B musical movie ever,"This is a brilliant and most entertaining B musical. It even garnered an Academy Award nomination for the song ""I've Heard That Song Before"" - music by Jule Styne; lyrics by Sammy Cahn and a big hit for Harry James around 1942.No really big names in the cast but a lot of fun.I've been hunting for a copy of this film for years, but I've never seen it on television and until now it's never been issued on video.So why the poor rating?Because it is a terrible print; very dark and fuzzy. I can only guess that it was the best copy that Synergy Entertainment could find. A great disappointment; I shall nevertheless continue enjoying it regardless of the poor quality as there is little likelihood of anything better showing up in the future.Full marks to Amazon for sending it so promptly - it arrived much sooner than they promised."
4,very good,"This is my first BT headset.Good: Contrary to some ""official"" reviews such as CNET, it is very comfortable for me. The car kit is very convenient, I leave my headset in it overnight, so it is always charged - thus the absence of AC adapter is not a problem for me. Excellent sound. Relatively cheap.Less good: It's not the smallest headset available, so if looking like an alien is a concern there are better (more expensive) options.General comment regarding BT headsets - how come you can't turn off the blue blinking light? When driving at night with this particular headset in its cradle you get a strong glaring blink that is very annoying"
3,Better Choices Available,"This is a decent origami book. I can see four stars if it happened to suit your particular taste, but five stars no way. I would suggest Honda's ""World of Origami"", either of Tuyen's books or Yoshizawa's ""Origami Museum I: Animals"" for some five star animal origami."
4,Good Insight,"I love the insight from Adam, however, we decided not to share this with our six yr old because we did not want her to make excuses for tantrums or think that aggression was acceptable behavior."
5,To Read in First Grade,I bought this for my son and I to read to his first grade class...haven't done it yet but is should be a great tool for educating the class and teachers.
5,"The rice mother, inspired me to write a review","When I read this book, it was the second of this authors, i enjoyed her other book, touching earth, but the Rice mother, i found it so awestriking that i had to write a review to let ot'hers know how i felt about it, and thats a first. The rice mother i found was a deeply inspired novel, the generational story made it seem like a fable, the spirituality and superstition in the novel gave it an air that lifted it above other books written in this genre. The magic and mysticality of every day life, and the harshness of the same all came out in one book. Amazing, she should be proud of this book. I didn't know what to do with the book once i'd finished it, i wanted all my friends to read it, but now im not sure if everyone would get the feeling i got from reading it and im not sure if i they should read it, i dont want them to have any halfling reactions to it.work well done,thank you"
3,Little distorted,Tapes sent with mirror could not be used due to the shape of it and a silicone glue had to be purchased.After installing and looking from the driver's seat the image is somewhat distorted on the side.
3,Not the best,"I bought this book as I need French spelled out phonetically. This book, however, just proved to be an exercise in frustration. For instance, on page 71 they cover the 'our' sound as in amour and jour and say it is pronounced as in the English word poor. This is accurate if you are pronouncing poor with a French accent. On page 5 it says to pronounce the vowel in le and me as in the English word again. I heard no similarity between the two sounds. I found no problems except with the comparison to English, but that is a huge problem. I'm getting rid of this book and trying a Berlitz. But for all you other language guides out there, with French in particular, add phonetic spelling, please."
5,Only for those who want perfection,"The material is rather tedious, perhaps boring for most, and wouldn't be suitable for them. However, if you are serious about perfecting your pronunciation, this is for you.The material concentrates on the many pronunciations for ""a"", for example. It covers in detail all the pronunciations for the various letters, beyond what most would attempt. In fact most don't notice or care about the subtle differences in how ""a"" is pronounced in different words. As is true in English, those subtle differences differentiate foreigners from those who try to learn a language well."
4,Good on flint and stone working...tools,"The discussion of tool industries as to how they were produced and how they were used by early man and his ancestors is very good: the best I have seen.The book is dated for sure, but the place names and dates are still pretty good as reference. The writing style is somewhat dry, but readable.The mention of carbon dated hearths in the new world at 23800, 28000, and 37000 years and then the default to Clovis was a disappointment.On reason this book is as dated as it is, is because of recent resultsin this area of new world dates. A whole new generation of authors will write about the new coastal and boat paradigms that extend new world population back much further than in this generation of books."
5,My kids LOVE it!,"I purchased the up and down roller coaster for my 16 month old son for Christmas. He LOVES it, his face just lights up everytime he plays with it. I also have a 3 1/2 year old daughter who loves it as well. My son uses it for so much more than just a roller coaster. He rolls balls, cars, trains, and just about anything else he can get his hands on down it. He even uses it has a little slide. It is ALWAYS the hit of the playgroup whenever we have other kids over. They can't get enough of it."
5,Great Toy,"My daughter is 2 and a half and she has had alot of fun, she likes to be pushed so it goes faster. It's always a hit with friends. I think the perfect age is 18 months."
5,BEST LARGE TOY EVER MADE,"I am so impressed by this toy. We put it out in the living room for a couple weeks and then disassemble it and put it back in the garage until the kids miss it again. Each time, it is so easy to put back together. Whoever designed this toy, kudos to you because you are brilliant. It is so cleverly designed. The kids love it. You need a good length of hallway to make this fun but if you don't, just put a pillow or soft cushion at the end for them to bounce off of. (Just be sure to follow the age guidelines. For younger kids you can hold onto the handlebars and guide the car down the coaster and down the hallway.) This is one of those one in a million toys that I have been happy about buying since day one and we have had ours for four years."
5,Very satisfied eith DGT clock.,"Very good product, all standard times!!Next year I'm travelling to the United States and I have in mind to go in brief for the DGT electronic E-board."
3,"Great wagon, but nothing to compare it to really","This is the1st wagon we've purchased for our son, so I really don't know how it compares to others since it's all we've had. So far it has been great. It is very easy to take the sides off, and it fits fine in our VW Golf leaving plenty of room for everything else we take these days. One problem I have is keeping my son seated in the wagon while we pull it. He keeps trying to stand- I wish it had seatbelts. But none that we looked at do, and for all the other features this wagon offers, it seemed the best one out there to us. I love the storage compartment . I'm also glad it's plastic so will not rust like mine did when I was little."
4,Very good value for the $$$,"Chairs arrived two days past delivery date but where in perfect condition. The color is lighter than in the photo; however, they still matched my decor (they are a light beige instead of the light lemon yellow that shows in the photo). Luckily my roommate and another friend assembled them for me, and they look absolutely elegant! Very good value for the money."
5,Wow! Ace of Base are the hottest group in the world!,"Ace of Base has great music, although they're completely underrated. Why? They are the best group! The radio stations should play their music more! This is a compilation of their best songs, believe me,this CD is fabulous! The lyrics are great and the music sounds very good! I love them! Linn (the blonde chick) is sexy and she's got a great voice! The other girl, Jenny looks pretty good, too and her voice is beautiful(she sings the new hit Every time it rains). LINN, JENNY, JONAS & ULF RULE! One more thing: I LOVE YOU, LINN!"
3,"Good, but ""Singles Of The 90's"" is much better","I agree with those who say that Arista is trying to stop AoB's success on the US. After destroying the great european album ""Flowers"" and releasing an average US version called ""Cruel Summer"", they did something else to ""Singles Of The 90's"". They removed 6 tracks and replaced them with 2 average remixes. Actually I like all the tracks on this CD. But where are ""Happy Nation"", ""Living In Danger"", ""Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry"" ?? Why did they include the acoustic version of ""Lucky Love"" instead of the original ? And of the 3 new AoB tracks released, they chose ""C'est La Vie (Always 21)"", the weaker of the 3. The only things I liked is the remix of ""Everytime It Rains"", better than the version on ""Singles Of The 90's"", and the fact that there is ""Life Is A Flower"" on it which wasn't on ""Cruel Summer"". So, you understood, buy ""Singles Of The 90's"" insted of this ""Greatest Hits""."
4,"Good, but missing some great songs.","When I first learned about the release of a greatest hits collection in the U.S., I was thrilled! However,when I learned what the track listing was, I was very disappointed. Sure, they included some of their big radio hits (e.g. ""The Sign"" and ""All That She Wants""), but I was expecting some new tracks with this album, or at least a couple more of the great songs they have composed (such as ""Cecilia"" or ""Hello, Hello"", which was featured on their ""Singles of the 90's"" collection released in Europe.) They did, however add an excellent remix of 'Everytime It Rains"" and additional versions of ""Beautiful Life"" and ""Lucky Love."" Overall, the record execs. did pick out some of their best music, but could have also added a few more songs."
5,Inspirational,"The first story I read in this was ""Sonny's Blues"" and I realized there was more to it than just a story- and that the blues is more than just b5ths but a greater understanding of life - highly recommended."
3,OK! Almost there but not completly,"Coming from an ""insider"" this tells the story about the inner workings of the finance company rather beautifully. The situations created are hilarious and the author is certainly witty at times - which overall makes it a nice, light book to read. Some of the chracters created are very interesting and funny. However, I have two gripes. One, the author is unable to hide his dislike for his company's CEO and it comes out from the book that he is less than fair to him. Two, the book gets a little technical at times going into, for example, the details of how a mortgage bond work and why is better (or not) vis a vis a junk bond. Coming from a bond salesman they are not rather expected but they do take away the basic flow of the book. Overall a funny book with average grades."
3,easy reading,I was enjoyable to read but i still don t get the big fuss and cross references to the book
4,Peeling a Banana,I am only half the way through the book and I have learned more about trading than the past 20 years. Like everyone I believed in the orderliness of the market. This book gives you great insight into the large trading companies like Salomon Brothers and the practices of the mortgage market. You will walk away with your head shaking. Incredible book.Marty Lenow
3,"Fun at first, a chore to finish","Michael Lewis knows how to tell some nice anecdotes about life on Wall Street, but after the first 20 pages, it's largely a tale of the stresses of bond trading. He does go into some detail about how the deregulations of the 1980's allowed for many interesting types of trading, but it remains largely dull for the rest of the book.If you're looking to be entertained, a better book about Wall Street would be Bombardiers by Po Bronson. After reading both books, it's very obvious that Bronson was heavily influenced by Liar's Poker, but by being pure fiction, allows for more interesting and sympathetic characters and is far funnier."
3,Liar's Poker covers a topic which interests me,"I wanted to learn about the go go 80s, but mediocre writing and a weak narrative style made the book a challenge to enjoy. Parallels between the bond market crash in the 1980s and the housing market crash of 2008 make the book a worthwhile read, even if the writing can be slightly annoying."
4,educational,"I would have given the book 5 stars but the author was so good at portraying the boring training sessions, I soon grew bored of the redundant stories of the training session. However I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the book and the insights into how human ego and human error bring about unintended consequences all in the pursuit of greed. Michael's honesty about his salary in proportion to his expertise is refreshing. I would recommend this to a friend."
2,Unremarkable,"This book was nowhere near as good as all the five star reviews led me to believe. The writer offered some amusing commentaries, but as a whole the book was quite dull. There are no great revelations nor uncommon insights. Instead, Lewis spends half the book descriping events of which he admits he had no firsthand knowledge.Not a horrible book, but it is very lightweight and doesn't deeply penetrate any of its topics. If you are looking for an amusing, easy-to-read day in the life account of a Wall Street trader, you may enjoy it. Anyone looking for a more hard-hitting account of the era should check out ""Predator's Ball"" or ""Den of Thieves"""
5,Great read,"This book had me after the first chapter, which left me with the hair on the back of my neck tingling with excitement. Michael Lewis is a great story teller and since he was on ground zero for Salomon brothers during their early years it gives him a massive amount of insight. This book is hilarious to read because it documents the mortgage trading culture wonderfully during its infancy...and explains how salomon bros sowed the seeds of it's own destruction early on with poor business practices while simultaneously creating the dangerous market of mortgages and derivatives. Excellent to read, complex but in layman's terms, and most importantly it is organized like a good novel: complete with beginning, middle, and end. I highly recommend this book for not only its informational value, but for its entertainment value as well."
4,Pretty Darn Interesting,"This was a pretty good book because it tells you things that make you want to keep listening, it holds your attention. You will learn some things from this book. The only bad thing about this book that i didnt like was how the author occasionally went off on unusual/complicated tangents when describing things. The kind of sentences you have to read atleast 3 times.....but i still recommend it. FIASCO was also very good.sayanora"
3,Entertaining & Easy Read,"Hey Queen nice dogs you have therePrice of oit $12/barrelThose who say don't know, and those who know don't sayThe end of fixed stock brokerage commissions had come on May 1, 1975.3 bond groups: government, corporate and mortgagesTED; difference between the LIBOR and interest rate on a 3-month treasury billJohn Gutfreund, appointed chairman by William Salomon, son of one of the firm's 3 founding fathers.Lewis Raniere, utility bond trader to Mortgae king 1979Paul Volcker October 6,1979 speech short term interest sky rocketsMeum dictum pactum: My word is my bondPredator's ball - Trace the rise of Drexel's junk bond departmentCorporate Raiders: Ronald Perelman, Boone Pickens, Carl Icahn, Irwin Jacobs, Sir James Goldsmith, Nelson Peltz, Samuel Heyman, Saul Steinberg and Asher Edelman."
4,One of the classics,"This is one of the classics on Wall Street trading rooms in the 80s. It is somewhat outdated by now. The book is fairly well written, although Lewis has an annoying habit of always telling you what he is planning on telling you before he actually tells you.For a newer, fresher book I would suggest Monkey Business: Swinging Through the Wall Street Jungle. It does for investment banking what Liar's Poker did for trading. Enjoy it!"
3,Liars Poker,"Good book, just not the cult classic I heard about. If you're not into stocks, bonds, the market, etc it's not for you. I think the author was very humble abous his own success, but in the end I think the book itself is overrated."
5,Just brilliant!,There's no other word to describe this book. I haven't laughed out loud this many times while reading any other book I can remember. A must read for anyone who has ever worked in Corporate America and especially the investment/finance business. A charmingly witty and brilliant inside look at the game of snakes and ladders the investment banking industry can be....
4,Still relevant after all these years,Just finished this book and couldn't put it down. Michael Lewis weaves a story of what makes our financial system the greatest and the worst in the world. Salomon Brothers training system and cut throat ways are something out of a Hollywood story and Michael ties it all together to show you the absurdity of the investment world and how the sucker in the room is the one who doesn't know the answers before the question is asked.
3,"Interesting, but no In Search of Dracula","The author was at a considerable disadvantage when he went in search of Frankenstein - there is no one historical figure who corresponds to Victor Frankenstein the way Vlad Tepes corresponds to Dracula.He solves this quandry by spending most of the book in search of Mary Shelley's travel itinerary instead, which can be interesting, but also as dreadfully boring and stuffy as any early English travelogue. Celebrity gossip about Percy and Byron is used to fill in extra pages - again interesting, but not what the cover promised.Overall, this was not the book I'd hoped for, a book that explores the history of the mad scientist concept as thoroughly as the vampire has been covered. It may still be worth reading, but only if you know what you're getting into."
4,A Confrontational Style of Photography!,"These models or friends of the photographer, Marc Bessange, are not in the least bit shy. All of these individuals seem very tough, daring the camera to keep photographing them. There are no nude shots here, but some of these guys present a very erotic, and tense image that's hard to ignore. These are French guys you would see everyday and be visually attracted in passing. Another great book from a photographer who is quite different than the others. Enjoyable!"
2,believable??,"As I read this story, and the author accused more and more people of sexually abusing her, I had a really hard time believing what she said. Most accounts of Beth Short have been very specific on one point; she was sexually immature, her genitals weren't fully developed. Now, because of this woman's book, we are supposed to believe that, not only was the Black Dahlia a promiscous whore, but that her father was also Beth Short's baby's father? There was no evidence mentioned in the autopsy report of her having recently been pregnant. I find Janice Knowlton's book very graphic, and maybe she did see her father murder someone, but she hasn't proved to me that the person he murdered was Beth Short."
1,Interesting but hardly believable.,"Although the book was fascinating and quite interesting, I found it very hard to believe. The book talks about one of the most horrendous, unsolved murders of the 20th century with graphic detail but I find it hard to believe that if indeed the author's father was the killer of Elizabeth Short, wouldn't it have made headlines that the killer had ""finally"" been identified? For that reason alone, I found the book to be a good piece of fiction, but hardly anything more."
1,Typical Newton claptrap,"If you've read any of Michael Newton's other books, you know what to expect from this one. As a writer, Newton has an agenda. He's going to twist facts and even write fiction to make what should be news stories fit into his model of the world. The publisher was sued for unsubstantiated comments he made in the first edition of this particular book. The writing is amaturish and the point of view so heavy handed you have to wonder who he's trying to convince, the reader or himself. In this instance Newton takes a deluded woman and exploits her delusion. After ""Raising Hell,"" and ""Hunting Humans Parts I, and II"" it comes as no surprise. Newton is a writer who never lets the facts stand in the way of $5.99."
1,Not worth the money,Horrible book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. The book is written poorly and the content is questionable. I read alot of true crime and this is the only one I truly disliked. It may not even be true crime and maybe should be labeled a fiction book.
1,Read It Only As Entertainment,"I've read other E Short books. If it tells you anything, this woman also has ES as turning tricks with Marilyn Monroe. Ok, so the tether to reality is weak. If you get off on reading vulgar fantasies this book is for you, but it's probably mostly pure fiction, with a few facts thrown in to mess you up. However, the author will probably work the sympathy angle do get her 15 minutes. Was this on NPR?"
4,C.S. Lewis Out of the Silent Planet,"Here we have a story of early spce travel to Mars, known to local inhabitants as Malacandra. A bit weird as C.S. Lewis can be, yet very entertaining."
1,Hard to follow,This is a book that was hard to follow and confusing at times with no explanation of many topics introduced. I was dissapointed in C.S. Lewis.
2,Wordy,"Like trying to read stereo instructions. I guess I was expecting too much, just could not wait for it to be over."
2,Love Lewis- Lukewarn about this book,"I am a CS Lewis fan. Have read Chronicles, Till we Have Faces, Screwtape Letters, etc. Was really excited to read this book based on the reviews posted here. I was terribly disappointed. This book moved at a snails pace. I was bored to tears until chapter 12 picked up through 18, and let down through the last post script. I am not sure if the reviews were based on Lewis the author or the book- but I didn't get the raves. Needless to say, I am done with the space journey and won't be finishing the trilogy."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"If I was lamenting the state of contemporary fiction, as wikipedia mentions Lewis says in his biography, this is not what I would want to see happen to provide a cure.A cure for insomnia, or, in a pinch, a firelighter, perhaps, but there is not much else of interest here."
4,Out of the Silent Planet,"I enjoy everything C.S. Lewis has written.This is a little different than I am used to, however, can't wait to read the next two.I would recommend this to all of my family and friends."
5,The best of the three,I love Lewis and I love SciFi so this was a perfect combination for me. I really loved this one and felt it was the best of the trilogy. Lewis is very imaginative and creative. A talent too often missing in SciFi today.
2,Huh?,"I don't know what else to say about this book, other than that it doesn't seem to have much of a concept. Guy goes to Mars, wanders around with alien races, learns that humans are screwed up, goes home. There, I just saved you a couple of hours."
2,Hard to Pedal and Steer,"This tricycle is not worth the money, especially for younger kids. neither of my children could steer or learn to pedal on this, we bought the plastic bikes, and off they went! Maybe this is a good bike for the child who know how to pedal and ride, but definitely not worth it for a first bike!!"
2,A rather heavy trike....,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 18 months old. She's only just begun to ride it. It's a very durable sturdy bike, but it seems quite heavy for my daugter to get into motion by pushing the pedals. If you give her some momentum she can cycle for a bit, but then the effort is too much. It is also difficult for her to get it into motion from stationary. I don't know how this compares with other bikes, but my daughter is quite strong and she has no problem pedalling on the radio flyer bikes at her playschool. I bought this off the internet without doing much research into it. In hindsight, I wish I had taken her to a store and got her to try a few bikes."
4,Great bike--but it does tip,"This is a very nice bike and my just turned three year old daughter loves it. She's anxious to ride it every day. The hand brake is easy to use and the rubber tires really grip the road. She loves the control she has over this bike and I love the safety strap and parental control bar. She has tipped the bike over several times, however, which surprised me considering some of the other reviews stating it as nearly tip proof. I suspect any bike will tip if the wheel is turned too quickly. Overall, I recommend this bike for its safety features and durability."
5,Don't worry,"I'm not calling anyone a liar or anything but I have this trike and it is next to freaking impossible to ""get your foot stuck between the pedal and the wheel"". Also you have to be an idiot to not be able to put this thing together. The trike ships in basically four pieces. With a ratchet you can put it together in 15 minutes no problem. Best value of all the Kettler trikes. Inflatable tires a huge difference. If you need the coaster wheel pay double to get a ""real"" Kettler model. Other than that this one is close to perfect"
1,"difficult to assemble, broke",This trike was complicated to assemble. The handlebars keep breaking loose from the front wheel due to a poorly designed attachment mechanism. Some of the plastic assesories quickly broke off but they were not much use anyway.
1,Wrong Product/0 feedback,HiI am a graphic designer and i work on print. I bought this color bridge for my work but i misplaced the order and it wasn't the color bridge that i needed. I try to contact the seller pantone but there was no response whatsoever.I am not satisfied whith the poorly customer service. Or the response from pantone.
3,Handy Reference,"Covers a lot of different animals with some useful guidelines to remember. Not the best of references if you don't already have some degree of knowledge in how to draw animals, but good if you go into it wanting to fine tune some things. It does not have much by way of the more unusual mammals like elephants, or fish and birds, however."
4,Some good insights and some great inspiration,"Jack seems to nail his outline very well with appropiatethick and thin line. Excellent shading and good referencefor how to quickly draw fur. I've only used a couple ofhis techinques but they seem to work for me espically thefirst page of basic shapes to start drawing with. Thesefirst pages made revisit the way I draw shoulder/arm andupper thigh/leg. ALSO check out my favorite artist RienPoortvliet, a man who knows how to do it right."
3,enjoyable one-time viewing,"This is basically a fictional documentary-style film. Character development is minimal. Although ""unrated,"" the movie is PG-13. Don't expect sex, nudity or violence. Worth watching once. I felt it was a well made, engaging effort. The packaging and trailer may, however, lead you to believe it's a steamy, character driven movie---which it's not."
5,Well worth the money!,"This is such perfect gift for children! I love this particular rug because it has lots of train tracks (which my son loves), and it also has roads. I was so excited when I opened it, the material is great and it looks as thought it will last for a long while. Can't wait to see my son's face when he opens it for Christmas!"
1,Santa does not exist in our house anymore!!!!,"I ordered this rug for my son for Christmas. Amazon thought it would be a good idea to send this rug all rolled up with the pictures on the rug facing outward. To top it all off, IT WAS WRAPPED IN CLEAR PLASTIC!!!!!! All of my kids who USED TO believe in Santa were asking what/who the rug is for!!!!! The idiocy is beyond words........"
1,What a waste of money,"We purchased the Gator for our boys for Christmas in 2001. We were immediately disappointed with how they designed the battery compartment. It's a hassle. Other than the battery compartment, we were happy with the Gator. The boys loved it. It went relatively fast. Too bad the Gator only lasted for 4 months. Now, the thing can't drive 5 feet. We had it repaired once and it just messed up again. This is the 3rd battery powered ride-on that we have purchased. We purchased a Power Wheels Kawasaki ride on 3 yrs ago, and we still haven't had the first problem with it. My advice, ""Don't get a Gator!!!!"""
2,Fun but not durable,"Bought the gator for my 3 and 4 year old boys last Christmas. They really loved riding it. However it wasnt very long before we had to replace a gear in it. It lasted a few more months but now it doesnt run very fast at all and loses power very quickly. We were very disappointed in the durablity of this toy. For as much money as it costed, we thought it would last alot longer."
5,Very good cutting board,"Over the past few years, I had become frustrated buying wooden cutting boards from various sources, only to have them warp or come apart where the wood strips are glued together. Not this board!I have now had it for just over a year, and except for making sure that there is no water left standing on it and handwashing it with mild soap and air drying it every night, I have not taken much care of it. I know I should oil the board regularly, but I never have had the time to do it. It has held up under my negligience, no warp, no splitting.I cut a lot of vegetables/fruit and the size of the board is perfect for me; something smaller would have been less useful.I definitely recommend this cutting board."
3,UNsoothing boot camp talk for GREAT workout,"This is a very challenging and GOOD yoga session. However, the tone he sets is that you're in bootcamp, and to ""tough it out"", rather than, ""release and breathe"" - the POINT of doing these to begin with. He also grunts and groans in this CD - uh, kinda weird. I have Kest's other Power Yoga videos that I LOVE, among several others that I use, but I did not like this CD. Of course ""Power"" Ashtanga style yoga is meant to be vigorous and challenging, but yoga should ALWAYS be SOOTHING to the mind, which this CD is not."
4,Bryan delivers yet again...,"I have attended Bryan's yoga classes for years, but traveling on business every week has made it more difficult to attend. With these CD's it's nice to hear a familiar voice taking me through the steps to a true ""spiritual"" experience. The workbook is easy to follow if you are new to yoga. Even the dog in the pictures is relaxed. Guaranteed to touch you both physically and mentally. Love it."
3,A Cautionary Note,"I have not read this book, but it is obviously based on a book by the same authors, Excel 2002 VBA Programmer's Reference.That book has numerous errors: incorrect code that will not run, code that has incorrect variables, code that has nothing to do with the text above or below it, screen shots that have nothing to do with the text.It also has an eclectic index that on occasion leads you to what you want.The authors have been let down by the Wrox editors, but on occasion one can find gems of useful information in their book. I would be quite tempted to review the present version of the text, but my past experience with Wrox-edited books makes me hesitant to spend more money on such texts.I hope someone who has actually read the book can supply us with a better review than this one.--j.r.a."
1,is not a good start from here,"sorry to say that i'm very dissapointed to own this book. For those who are new to VBA, it is not a good start from here. I also find that the example and the function covered is not practical enough to use to develop your own program. I would recomend a book written by John Walkenbach which the examples and function cover more practical"
5,"Five from a classic, and true, Triumph fan","I honestly remember getting this LP, and still have it, back in our Canadian home when I was an adolescent. I remember ordering from Columbia Records and getting the bulk shipment - in which one of these shipments was a load of Triumph LPs.This comilation has a lot of thier classic tracks with an additional ""unheard"" track or two. I will be honest in that I do prefer studio produced work, but think that the work here is well done and I can get into the feel of the event, the atmosphere of the day.Great work from a band that when I see their name now - brings me back to a wonderful stage in life."
2,Great if you don't have a clue on how to use menus,"Tells you how to access the features, but not why you would want to or what to do with the features after you access them. Basically teaches you how to use menus. No help in teaching how to improve your digital photos, with the features of Photoshop 6."
2,Not a good instruction book or reference book,"If I wanted to know where the blur effect is, I would just use Photoshops help. This book does not live up to its title, unless by ""fast & easy"" they mean the amount of time it would take to get through this book.I wish authors would stop creating beginners books that don't explain concepts. If anyone needs to know the difference between a motion blur and a Gaussian blur it is a beginner. Just showing a person the menu commands does the same as the manuals.I looked at this books because I have been forcing myself to transfer from Corel Photopaint to PhotoShop. I found this book to be a waste of time."
3,It's OK but nothing that great. Definitely NOT 5 stars,"It doesn't do a good job with the flat hair under my chin. It always leaves crumbs around my neck. I HATE that. I have to use the razor blade to get the hard spots. What a pain. I just bought the new Braun, we'll see how that works."
2,Lousy Cleaning System,"The razor isn't bad, but the cleaning system is a joke. Mine wouldn't release the razor & kept recleaning it. Plus, and I am surprised that this isn't mentioned in the other reviews that I read before getting the razor, the cleaning solution (which is an expensive, printer-ink type of gimmick) stinks like metal solvent. Bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price."
4,Like the features but,Love all the features but this shaver doesnt cut as close as I thought it would. I donot get a close shave. maybe the cutters are dull or something but my experience is not a positive one. On the other hand the self clean features and recharge stand are great. It really cleans the shaver well for a no maintenance shaver.
3,OK,The razor is OK. It is not close to a real razor and misses areas on my face. It does self clean well and does not cut me as much as a razor. If you are lazy and do not care if you have a super close shave this is a good buy.
4,the easy to use shaver,"the 8585 shaver is not only one of the best shavers i have ever used, it is so easy to maintain. I love this product."
2,What Happened?,"First of all I want to say that I am a true JB fan. I have learned all his horn lines ( trumpet ). Any band I play with, must play some James. This cd has lost the ""fat sound"" that he carried for years. His bass player, Fred Thomas, told me that he suggested to James to keep the music in the pocket but James didn't listen. Well this cd proves it. The sound is very thin and not the typical James Brown. I must be critical because I started listening to James in 1959. I always wanted to play in his band but the Air Force got me first.Respectfully,Chuck King"
4,Great toy but needs some work,For the money it is the greatest. I bought it a year ago. This is what you need to do to make it fun. You have to disable the excavator lock that holds up the arm. It does not need the lock. It frustrates kids. You have remove the screws that hold the arm together. Remove the small spring that snaps in the locking piece. Remove the locking piece. You do not need this lock because there is a bigger spring in the grey cylinder that can hold the arm up. Sand may get into this cylinder and bind it up. However it can be worked clean and does not break. Screw together again. Another thing is that the rotation of the arm is limited to left and right by a few degrees. Look under the unit and cut/grind off the turning limiting knob for full rotation. Now you have the most amazing toy on the beach. If it breaks buy another for parts.
3,Great Indoor toy but...,My son absolutely loved it when he got it as a gift. He hopped right on it. It comes with sounds and the two stage bucket is also a cool feature and it comes with a little hard hat.To operate the bucket the child has to twist the handle bars. I found this a little bit of a task as an adult and he didn't seem to have the strengh at 2 years old to get the bucket to release. We took it outside and as soon as he got sand int he moving parts it is no impossible to move the arm. He also wants to wear the hard hat but the adjustable strp will not stay fastened.As for driving it. He seemed to take right to it. The child must pick it up a bit to steer and he figured that part out. The top swivles and the track that it rides on goes straight. Soemtimes when he rides it in the house he gets the track caught on the coffeee table or other furniture.It's a fun toy but I wouldn't go out and buy another if I had to.
3,Light entertaiment,"I bought this one expecting it to be as amusing as ""Regular guys"" or ""Balls"". Unfortunately, it's not.Don't read the comments on the cover cause they have barely something to do with the film.I laughed maybe once or twice. Of course there are more funny moments, but they'd rather make you smile than laugh along loud.Acting is good, but the action is rather slow, at least during the first half of the film.To sum up: not bad, but Germans can do better :)"
1,"Circuitous, pointless poetry","What can you say about lines like ""no brackish suck to sea"" or something about a reddening to pass through the""pores of my face and willful to sicken"" except they are silly as can be? Or else, go to your dermatologist. These arent just silly but are for the most part, just plain godawful. They seem to be interior dramas that are not compelling to the general reader, making you wonder if even the poet himself knows what on earth he is talking about. My guess is, probably not. If you enjoy experimental poetry, this book is hardly the best place to read it."
2,Banned in Almost All Public Pools,"As a lifeguard and swim instructor who has worked at several public pools and works with people who have worked at many others, I have found a common theme of these being banned at almost all public pools because, when worn alone, they do not form an appropriate sanitary barrier. If worn with a plastic swim diaper with elastic around the legs they can work quite well. But when they are not they can lead to contamination of the water."
5,"Great product, great price.",Looked at many products but not many companies provide the leg guards in the less common team colors. Finally we found someone who sold a quality product and in the color we wanted!
4,Heavy but sturdy!,"The image seems to show a black rubberized grip further down on the handle, mine doesn't have that. It is however very very strong, as an example we used it to lever up a rather large cement fountain base full of water so we could level it out, and the shovel was a champ(maybe not smart but it was the only tool for the job). I will say that this shovel is heavy, heavier than the standard wood handled ones. For light gardening I will still need to order one not quite so serious."
4,"A ""Must-Have"" for the Serious Scrimshaw Collector!","This is an easy-to-read and easy-to-reference book which lists many of the more common reproductions of outstanding scrimshaw work. It is valuable for the beginner as well as the experienced scrimshaw lover/collector. Some repros are pretty good. If you are considering buying or bidding on scrimshaw over the internet, or you just like poking around antique and second-hand stores, this book can save you time and money. It's a great investment. Greasy good luck, mates!"
5,Excellent Anime for those who Love Realistic Plots,"This is a great anime, and it is different for the simple fact that it is very realistic. It's not a giant robot monster anime, nor one where the male lead is getting repeatedly punched into the stars. This is a very angsty anime about something that could potentially happen to someone in real life. The anime is based off the Japanese video game Kimi ga Nozomu Eien (The Eternity You Desire), a very risque dating sim, and it stays pretty true to the game's form. One thing that impressed me is that even though there is a fair share of nudity in the anime, none of it is gratuitous. It all fits in with the story very well, so it's not just a fanservice anime. I highly recommend this anime for people who like serious plots in their TV shows and anime. It will take you on an emotional roller coaster and have you wanting more."
3,Decent cd,"it's a good band and a good cd it's just...nothing original. it's the same cd that's been done a million times. the lyrics are great and i still love the cd and the style, but it's nothing innovative."
2,The enamel comes off when dropped,My daughter got this set for her second birthday. We took it out of the box and she started playing with it right away. Of course she has dropped the pieces on the floor a couple of times (she is only 2) and the red enamel came right off where it was dropped. Now only a few weeks later we have a set that is all chipped. I would rather buy a stainless still set next time.
3,false advertising,"Beautiful and nice functional shape for kitchen sink but arrived without the handles shown. Called HELP and was promised a new one WITH handles, but it arrived without handles too. PAIN IN THE NECK."
1,Cloned,"Dreadful. This band sounds exactly like Blink 182, the same manufactured sound in the processed vocals and riffs. Just think of the vocals of the guy in Blink 182's 'All the small things'.That vocal just hides the raw sound that im used to with punk, and the guy uses that same sound all way through the album.They shouldn't consider themselves a punk band - they're not raw, they're done already, they are clones and seem to have an idea that if they can clone another band's sound they'll piggyback onto it's success by using the same formula."
1,MISERY,ONE OF THE WORST ALBUMS OF THE YEAR...A RECORD PRODUCERS DREAM AND THE WORLDS NIGHTMARE.BREAK UP AND LET THERE BE ONE LESS CRAPPY BAND ON THE AIRWAVES. YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
5,great cd,"this is a great cd, all the songs on it are really really good. We went to their tour of the rising sun concert and it was well performed, an awesome show!!~m.m~"
5,rock oooooooooooooooooooon,this is a kick a** record buy it now you will see distructionhahahahahahaha
1,but here's my reason why.....,"Look. It's ok if you're into pop-punk like blink-182,NFG,saves the day and the like,but it's not at all original. Guitarworld discribed this as ""if you mix the beastie boys with NOFX and Iron maiden,That's sum 41"". Well,they got the NOFX CLONE part right. Some beastie style raps are found,but it's too late: The disc suffers from the usual 3-chords,song structures and pointless lyrics. I'm sure the guys are cool in general,but this isn't a good CD. If like everything you hear on MTV,then pick it up. Otherwise,keep searching."
2,too poppy,This album is just a little too poppy. A lot of the songs sound almost exactly the same.Best songs1. Fat Lip2. RhythmsDecent song1. Never wake upThe rest of the songs [aren't good].
2,Bubblegum Punk,"Actually, 2 stars is way more than I give to other bands of this genre. These guys at least have a bit of humour that isn't related to bodily functions (""Trashed my own house party 'cus nobody came""). Their references to 80s heavy metal will go right over the heads of most of the 12 year olds that buy this album... hinting of bigger and better things in the future. Hopefully they can live up to their potential... this album isn't it."
5,Sum 41 were a good,"when i first got this cd, i thought it was the best cd ever. they released a new cd which sucks and now i hate them with extreme passion! sum 41, evanescence, punk(not pop punk), rancid...suck and they r the worst bands ever! Crazy Town rule!"
2,Not worth the money,"This is pretty much all the normal pop [stuff], but they try to make themselves seem like punks, which i find very amusing. But its slightly better than all that new found glory [stuff]."
2,POP PUNK [STINKS],"This is not a punk album. This is a straight mainstream rock record that has the packaging of a punk band. Any true punk listener should stay far away. If however you like ""punk"" like blink 182 or american hifi or any of those other stupid bands, this cd would fit real good next to your linkin park and blink 182 cds. People who like real punk should not even look at this cd!"
3,All in Good Fun,"What can I say? It's all fun. Not too much substance, but fun. Sum 41 are less obnoxious than blink-182, whom I can't stand. The songs are pure punk songs, the guys are cute, the lyrics are funny. Not something I would listen to everyday (you have to be in the mood), but it's not bad."
4,Sum 41 All Killer No Filler,"Product arrived promptly and of course the album itself is very solid. The CD case was cracked upon arrival, but I have no complaints beyond that!"
1,How to be a punk star in the 21st century...,"1)make really (...) music!2) act like losers!3) mix it w/ rap (...)4) stir it for 5 secondsand then you get the ultimate junk band in the world.and i call this home made dish ""SUM 41"""
1,"not bad,not good either","well i've heard the song ""fat lip"" and i like the beat but the lyrics are [crud]. if you don't want to ""conform to society"" why play your videos on mtv. if you are on mtv you are a sell out(blink 182,p.o.d.) don't get me wrong i like some bands on mtv but they are still sellouts(p.o.d., red hot chili peppers, creed). if you want to listen to punk or pop - punk listen to relient k or dogwood they have good lyrics, good beats, and a good message."
1,TERRIBLE,"I would rather scoop my eyeballs out and eat them with a smile on my face all the while hearing babies SCREAM because they are on fire than listen to this TERRIBLE album again. Have you ever been stabbed in the face repeatedly with a ice pick? Take that feeling and times it by nine, and you will feel the agony of trying to listen to this god-awful record."
4,Good read,"I bought this book with the hope of learning something about big woods deer, which I hunt in my home state as well as Canada. This is a pretty good read with some great stories of big bucks (although muddied by a few annoying typos). I struggled trying to portray in my mind how Mr. Blood's hunting style (tracking and stillhunting in what I presume is semi-open, mountainous country) would apply to the brush country I hunt, but I had the same problems with books written about and by the Benoits. However, I've hunted big woods bucks for nearly 30 years, and a few points made by Mr. Blood hit home for me, so the book was well worth buying and reading."
1,Nice features but defective,"I ordered two of the Panasonic PV-C1353W 13"" TV/VCR units, one as a replacement for the other.The first had an approximately 1""x5"" blotch near the left center of the screen wherethe picture seemed to be faded out (lighter than the surrounding pixels).This was very apparent in the blue setup screens and when viewing fleshtones.Amazon rushed another to me within two days, but the second has the exact same defect and I am returning it today.I don't know if this is a basic defect in the model or if Amazon got hold of two or more bad ones.At any rate I am going to look for a different brand with the same features."
4,Textbook solid if the mod-prog is your thing,"Very fulfilling, accessible prog-rock from the Flower Kings frontman benefits from the lack of vocals and instead offers an epic 60+ minutes of unabashedly positive, irony-free melodic jamming. Next to their genius originators, bands like TFK's compositional prowess can feel second-rate, though here with Stolt's solo work, efforts feel distilled to consistently potent effect, despite a massive run-time which will compliment only the most album-oriented types."
1,To Basic for it's Title,I found this book lacking in information except in the area of how to perform basic exercises.
3,An early Hayley Mills film,"17-year old Brydie suffered some brain damage in a childhood accident and now runs wild in her tiny West Country village, playing in the graveyard with small children and obsessing about death. The townsfolk look the other way, but when a young gypsy man starts following her, they fear for her safety.Hayley Mills was 20 but looked 12 when she made this movie which was written by her mother and directed by her father. She's quite good as the innocent, damaged girl, even though she overdoes the hysterics a few times. Ian McShane, as the gypsy man who fancies Brydie, is good but looks a bit too old and menacing to be her love interest. The movie is very low-key and slow, wandering aimlessly for the first half and only developing some action at the very end.""Gypsy Girl"" was originally titled, ""Sky West and Crooked,"" a phrase that refers to Brydie's mental state. It's a rare find for fans of Hayley Mills and an interesting, though decidedly low-budget-looking, film."
5,nightmarish awesome.....,this is a excellent hypocrisy album but i have to remark most on the one song title track its so ghoulish sound very awesome instrumentation ..on this the song fluxuates different effects in it...another awesome track to escape is to die has almost a thrash metal feel to it right down to the song nightmare-which is just as it says very nightmarish sound do not pass up pentralia it is early death metal classic they are death metal with almost mixture of some death metal feel use of keyboards not many death bands use them peter tagtgren is very talented individual a god of death metal so to speak .genius to the death metal /dark death metal industry...cya
5,Penetralia,"More of the same thrashing, technical metal you'd expect from this band. If you're a fan of Hypocrisy, this title is a must have."
1,hazle un favor a tu mente....,"por favor no contribuyan al hacer mas grande la fortuna de carlos cuahutemoc sanchez y su grandiosa mansion, lean cosas que valgan la pena, lean a gente qu en su vida ha vivido experiencias, eventos fuertes cosas de las cuales podemos aprender todos, no lean a un pobre hombre rico que escribe para jovenes , donde sus protagonistas son gente utopica que vive reprimida por sus grandes ideales, no, esto no hace falta entre nosotros, hay tantas cosas bellas en el mundo para arruinarlo con esto.thanks"
4,not what you think,"this is not the metalcore unearth hailing from new england. that was formed in 1998. these guys are from seattle washington and don't play anything that resembles the unearth that hardcore kids know of today. these guys play some pretty awesome stuff. its kind of a mix between the melvins and foo fighters. for fans of nirvana, soundgarden and alice in chains. its pretty psychedelic sometimes so all you drugies will love it too. definatly a buy for people who want to revert back to the 90's."
2,off the beaten track of modern life,"a better title for this book might be, strange signposts in an otherwise interesting world. He became a devout Catholic while the rest of us were questioning its relevance. C. Pierce's psychologic discovery or insight does not seem especially significant. This MD does not provide the right presciption for our times."
5,A classic,"Great book by a great writer, simple, concise and complete. I was delighted to read it. Priority project for those who want more knowledge about naval history."
1,B.I.G.,Biggie is terrible and he has never had a good album. People loved one of the worst rappers ever to ever set foot on this earth. He should have died before he was born
1,BORING,This CD shouldn't have came out.Its very disappointing.Puffy needs to quit and retire at the same time
3,Born Again,Well to be completely honest I was disapointed with this album. And that's not B.I.G.'s fault. All of his lyrics and verses are on point. It's just the horrible production they chose to go with. None of it fits his style at all. And makes the album pretty boring. They should have stuck with the original beats and production he had recorded the songs with and it would have been a lot better. They really should re-release this with the original beats. . .
1,What da hell did you do to this album Puff!,"I would like to say that this album is incredible, but I can't. This album was a BIG waste of time and production. Puffy took sampling too far on this album. Only three songs I liked, ""Dead Wrong"", ""Dangerous MC's"", and ""Rap Phenomenom"". Puff CANNOT rap, Kim is too full of herself, and that ""Notorious"" is so wack, AND the remix. This album would make BIG turn over in his grave. Peace to the Wu-Tang Clan (The ILLEST MC's of all time! ), and the Bronx. (I'm so disgusted!)"
4,not the best biggie ablum,"i rushed to the store to go and get this ablum, and it was worth it dead wrong is tight. the cash money track is tight b.G and biggie killed it. the rest of the ablum is alright, track 5 and 7 and 14 are tight, and i was shocked to here ice cube on if I should die. peace out"
3,He Wazn't Pac,"Yo Biggie was aight, but he was no 2Pac! Pac had everything planned out in advance. Homie knew shhh would prolly go down and that he wasn't gonna be round much longer. He knew sum1 waz gonna try n steal his light and leave him d.o.a. So he put his mind to werk and padded down mad songs and at least got most of the verses to em recorded. He had everything planned out. Biggie didn't. That's why Big isn't the best rapper of all time. Plus Pac's biggest singles were like Brenda's Got a Baby and Keep Ya Head Up. Songs that had meaning and good positive messeges to em. Don't recall Biggie havin a big single like those or the others Pac had like Changes and Keep Ya Head Up Part Two. He may have been a good rapper but he was no Tupac that's for sure, so don't compare the 2. Westside fo life yo."
2,IT IS SAD WHAT PUFF DID TO THE ALBUM,"This album was supposed to prove why Biggie was one of the greatest rappers of all time, instead puff filled the album with too much guests from Ice Cube to Eminem, in a word it was full of commercial s**t. They said that this album is Biggie's last album and it is really sad that his album will be that bad. If Biggie was alive he wouldn't release an album like that."
3,ploya@homtail.com,"This album has its good songs and not so good songs, the stuff no one has heard is good, but the remixes Puff should of left out. I don't think BIG would of been proud of this album. It definately needs some work. Puff tried to duplicate 2PAC's miracle of putting out bomb albums--whether dead or alive. I love BIG, but this album just ain't tight all the way through."
3,B I G's Posthumous Release?,"This album was his worst album, but for Biggie, that's still not bad. The album has an eerie feel that Sean Combs is sitting in his massive office rolling around naked in Benjys that were specifically made from Biggie's third album. The Confederate States of America have no idea what they're talking about. This culture is what's driving billions and igornant caucasians don't know the first thing abour aural aesthetics"
1,A mess...,"This was such a over hyped album because it was all the unheard Biggie songs plus loads of new beats and Featuring todays cream of the crop artist`s. Being a massive 2pac fan I really think Biggie is one of the best rappers ever like 2pac, but I dont like Puff Daddy because of his huge ego and small music brain. He does`nt play any instruments he can`t dance or Rap but he is very good at management. He took Biggie`s hardcore beats and replaced them with poor poppy comercial beats making the album very intensivly boring and leaving a sour taste in the mouth. Dead Wrong was the best song on the album because PD did not Rap in it at all. Biggie lives on Puff Daddy ruins the Fans dream..."
3,RIP BIGGIE,I love biggie if it weren't for Jay-z he would be my favorite MC . This was obviously just a scheme to make money its ok.Best songs1.Who shot ya2. Notorious3. Dead Wrong
4,Hmmmmmmm a Puffy production,"This was an attempt so puffy can squeeze more outta a tragic death. On the upside it brings out a lot of biggie's original rapping style, which is much harder and a bit faster, which lights up the album, couple nice beats, 4 stars in memory of big poppa"
1,Puffy messed it up!,"This album would've been better if Biggie is alive and if Puffy didn't messed it up. The new Pac album ""STILL I RISE"" is way better than this one. Go get the new Pac instead of this. Don't waste your money on this album."
4,Starsky approved,"I bought this spray after noticing my dog was rubbing his nose raw when I would leave him in his crate. I looked for something that would help with his separation anxiety and this seemed to be the best option. I am unsure what really worked the spray or moving his crate because I did both and he stopped. Now I only use the spray on occasion when I think he needs it(storms,high wind,busy house noises). It seems to help some."
5,Great book for Nat8 management,"I really found this text to be quite useful for managing a SQL*Net and Net8 environment. All of the details are explained in a clear fashion and the text is very comprehensive and complete. Overall, this is a suberb treatment of a complex subject."
1,Bad Quality,"The quality of this DVD is reallllllllly bad. The actor's mouths are not moving with the sound track. It's like watching a Japanese movie with English dubbed in. We bought this, sent it back for replacement, and the second one is as bad as the first.Guess I'll have to tape it off of TV sometime."
4,enjoyed book,As a Rosicrucian I really enjoyed reading this book about our first traditional Grand Master
1,DVD Brokedown after minimal usage,"I received this television as a gift and after only viewing 3 dvds, the player skipped and stalled out, quitting to operate. Very dissatisfied that it happened and that Panasonic only backs up it's products for 3 mos (parts for 1 year, labor not). It seems that they are producing disposable televisions. Poor experience and not the first with Panasonic. I would not recommend doing business with Panasonic. As long as people continue to put up with poor quality, it will be in the market."
4,Thoughts about Amplified,"Amplified is an album that will be appreciated by old Tribe fans. Q-Tip is one of the few recent Hip Hop artists that makes an album that is almost a completely solo effort. This has a good/bad effect on the album. Overall, this album could get a 5, but songs 5 and 6 are somewhat weak, and the Korn song just plain sucks. Since there are only 12 songs (13 if you count the bonus track)this album also isn't very long. However, if you want a short, and pretty good album, this should be a pick-up for you."
2,"Q-TIP, GET A HOLD!","The legacy that A Tribe Called Quest left was a positive one which I appreciate greatly. Their beats were unique and their lyrics were meaningful. Once Q-Tip went solo, I expected him to continue along his path of rightousness. He even changed his name to Kaamal Fareed in a committment to his new faith. Instead it appears that he has been seduced by fast money and faster females. This cd is for people who are attracted by superficial things not spiritual essence. The beats are simple and lyrics are garbage. The last thing Americans, especially black children, need to see is another money-hungry entertainer grinding on mindless sex-objects. I'm sure De La Soul will not go this route when they release their album. Buy Aceyalone's album, ""Book of Human Language"" instead!"
3,"Good beats, but Q-Tip's better than this.","I have followed the Tribe for a long time, and have allof their albums, my favorite was Beats, Rhymes andLife. I also have Amplified, and I have to say Q-tipchanged his style. Not his delivery, he's one of thebest at that, but his lyrics. He had more of a messageto send to those who were listening back then. Sure hehad cuts like ""Bonita Applebum and Electric Relaxtion"",but not all his songs were about hookin' up with ahoney. And that seemed to be what he was rappin' aboutfor the most part in Amplified. Still, I liked the beats, and Q-Tip'srapping voice and delivery is one of the best around.Phife's first solo album to me had more of the messagesthat the Tribe would send to those who were listening.They both have excellent solo's, but they are betterworking together. ..."
1,WACK,"I cant believe I bought this garbage. Its already been said so I wont waste bandwith but damn, WHAT HAPPENED TIP?"
4,IF IT'S GOT KORN>>>>>>>> IT'S GOOD FOR ME!,"I'd like to say wasup first of all to my posse and secondly..........Q-Tip's new album rules for one reason and one reason ONLY..........KoRn........""End Of Time"" is the best song on the album and without the presence of KoRn the album would be nuttin! Oh and I also like ""Breathe and Stop"".......but I fear that it'll become over played like that dang ol' ""Vibrant Thing""..............PEACE OUT :)"
3,Not what ATCQ fan would expect......,"Now the first time I heard this CD I thought it was horrible. I didn't listen to it again for a LONG time... but when 'Let's Ride' came out, I thought the beat was descent, so I listened to it again... and it still wasn't that good. If your A Tribe Called Quest fan, like I am, you won't like this album, but if your into the Cash Money, No Limit type music, you probley will. But Q-Tip is nothing like he was in ATCQ."
3,BETTER WITH TRIBE,"THIS CD IS ONLY FOR THE FANS OF Q-TIP'S,IF YOU WANT TO HEAR WHERE HE WAS HIS BEST-BUY TRIBE CALLED QUEST CD'S. THAT IS A SAFER BET!"
1,To all Tribe fans...,"Throughout my whole life my name has been synonymous with Q-Tip. No one will understand how much Q-Tip, Phife, Ali have musically inspired me, and enlightened me on aspects of life. But I have to say Q-tip has changed. I am going to be even brutal and speculate he is making music JUST for the money now, and trying to produce the next new ""party"" song. His lyrics are now strongly directed to ""sex"" and toward the ""stereo typical"" black community, which is fine for his new fans, but don't buy to this album if you're a true quester."
3,I'm disappointed,"One of the things that made me ATCQ fan was the fact they were different from alot of rap groups....Not a lot of sex/women in their videos and they rapped about something different....They might've had a few sex tracks hear and there, but overall, they strayed from the normal rap lyrics. I expected to hear the same with Q-Tip going solo. Unfortunately that's not the case. Most of the lyrics I've heard from him lately (including guest appearances) have been laced with sex and the videos have half-dressed women in them now. If I want to see/hear that, I'll go to Puffy, Biggie (RIP) or any of the other 50 million rappers who rhyme about that stuff.I'm all for re-inventing oneself and maybe that's what he's doing....more power to him (or maybe this is the real abstract poetic). I'm just not feeling it."
3,Nothing Special,"I've just listened to this albumn and I'm disappointed. I expected great things from Tip especially after hearing the song ""Breate and stop"" and what he'd done with A Tribe Called Quest. I'ts alright to listen to a few times after which your probably gonna let it gather dust. If your looking for a good hip hop albumn go for Mos Def's albumn Black On Both Side or Dre's 2001."
4,"Remember folks, we're not reviewing ATCQ, this is Q-Tip...","I still appreciate the lyrical skills of Q-Tip. It wouldn't be fair to judge this CD and Q-Tip to past Tribe Called Quest albums because of course, Q-Tip doesn't have the lyrical back-up of his former teammates. To be honest with you, I was really feelin this album; and no this may not be the best hip-hop album ever, but I'd rather listen to this than other groups that rap about nothing better than how rich they are, how many different cars they have, and how many women they get (who cares? ) - do the names E-40, B.G., and Lil' Zane ring a bell?"
3,"The CD is okay, but I miss my ""Tribe""","There were a couple of tasteful treats on this one. I shall be grooving to ""Breathe or Stop"" for quite some time! But every other song begins to sound the same as the CD plays on."
5,Well done! A joy to read!,"Reading through this collection of delighful and witty ""prayers"" I found myself nodding wide-eyed with recognition and laughing til my cheeks hurt.Great at work, on the phone and even to share with the family.Good work guys!"
1,A ripp-off,"I tried to save my wife's Samsung cellular as here charger stopped working after several years.This Charger arrived very late and when I plugged it in, I saw a faint red light on the charger, and, afer several hours the phone would not charge. I am throwing it away and have to purchase a new phone for my wife. End of story!"
2,Can't Judge a Book (or a CD) by its Cover,"As our friend from New Zealand says above, this is not the Russ Freeman you think. I had no idea two musicians could have the same name any more than two actors or bands could have the same name. Imagine if you bought a CD from a band called ""The Beatles"" only to find out it was a grunge band from 1990. Lesson learned? Read reviews before you buy."
1,Better Books Out There,"I used to own all of Sarah Kramer's books, but have given them away. They came highly recommended, but I found them to be too simple, and almost insulting. I mean, does a person really need a burrito recipe, or a fruit smoothie recipe?Plus, many of these recipes were contributed by fans, and since I got iffy results from them (and have friends who got the same iffy results), it makes me wonder if they were even kitchen tested before being considered for the book.Unrelated to the recipes----I would have preferred if investments had been made in a few really nice, color photographs of the FINISHED DISHES, rather than multiple, black & white photos of the author. Is it a cookbook, or a personal photo album?"
1,More of the same,"I am a fan of the previous two cookbooks in this series, but this one doesn't have much new to offer. Many of the recipes are from other people and there seems to be a lot of typos, which makes me doubt that all of the recipes were tested. Also the author's photo is on almost every page. Shouldn't the photos be of the food? Or how about no photos at all? It's distracting and self-absorbed. The index, as in the previous two Sarah Kramer vegan cookbooks, is virtually useless. There are no footers on the pages, so you have to page to a section's start page to know where you are in the book. There are some good recipes but I don't think I will buy Kramer's inevitable sequel."
3,Aw-ight,"I'm not going to rave and rave about this book like everyone else. It is merely ""aw-ight."" I do appreciate Kramer's commitment to veganism and her personal thoughts about that, but the many, MANY pictures of her on, like, every other page get corny after a while. Many of the recipes are things that any halfway creative person that had a clue could pull together on their own. I think the book could have used some editing, both for bulk (like nixing some of these no-brainer recipes) and for correctness: there is a recipe for a sauce that tells the reader to mix two powdered ingredients in a blender and makes no mention of water or any liquid. Hello!?!"
3,OK,"I was pretty disappointed with the book when I first bought it. Most of the recipes are so simple that I don't really even need to read the method. Over time it has grown on me. When I'm feeling extra lazy or broke, it comes in handy. All of the ingredients are cheap and easy to find, which is a plus when you live in the south. The Sloppy Jane recipe is fantastic, my carnivorous husband asks for it regularly. The beans in the Sweet Potato & Black Bean Burrito are some of the best I've had. Overall, it's just ok. If you're looking for a great vegan cookbook, go with theVeganomicon: The Ultimate Vegan Cookbookinstead."
5,Good Handheld Unit to Start Off,"I received this sudoku handheld for christmas as a gift. I started to get into sudoku a few months ago. while i still like to clip out the newspaper clipping, this handheld lets me take my growing gaming addiction on the go. there aren't many buttons so it's pretty intuitive on what to push to make it work. hope this helps!"
3,Cute cartridge but never got used,This is a really cute cartridge but I never used it. I hated the uppercase B as it is top heavy and I thought it looked strange. I think this is one that would be good for baby or kid projects though.
5,Great prop gun,"It came in perfect time for the show it was purchased for. The girl who played Amaryllis loved it so much she asked her mom to buy it from me so she could keep it. It was bought to be used as a prop in ""The Music Man"" and made the scene a lot more funny."
2,So standard.........,"This book was so standard that it was almost painful to read. I liked the characters well anough, but there was so much that the author could have done that she just didn't go through with."
3,3 and 1/2 stars,I enjoyed this book but it was not one of my favorites. The story kept you going but it was NOT something you just couldn't put down. I read it throughout the week and it was nice for hourly entertainment. I felt that Pierce was annoying at times especially dealing with his lack of faith. Rose Woodbine-way to go. You rock. She was an awesome heroine. Pierce did not deserve her.
4,An odd rating given my opinion of the book.,"I absolutely despise most of what this book puts forth. This book, the very bed rock of Romantic thought, is (in my opinion) the root of many of our modern problems because it begins unraveling of the basic thesis of the Enlightenment: cultivate reason and be wholey guided by it. That being said a person cannot fully understand the Romantics, and by extension our own society, without first reading and understanding Rousseau. The veneration of nature, the noble savage, all of the things that the Romantics aspired to or believed in has its seed in this book, so if you are a romantic or if you just want to understand more about this philosophical era, then this is the book for you."
2,read if you have too much time on hand,"I found this book extremely boring. While there are few interesting parts, Rousseau found it necessary to relate detail after monotonous detail. Composing over 600 pages, this book would of been less tiring given half the length."
1,PREACHY AND CONDESCENDING,"TAKE YOUR BEST ODDS DIET AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR HEALTHY, FIBER FILLED COLONS!"
1,Want to be miserable all nine months? Buy this book!,"This has got to be one of the most miserable and depressing books out there! Don't believe me? Before you buy it, read a few pages on the beginning of each month. It gives you a huge list miseries you should expect for that month. Yeah, women do go through alot durring pregnancy but had I not read it on my fourth month, I wouldn't of even noticed some of the symptoms because I was focused more on the wonder inside of me rather than the constipation, hemmroids, swollen feet, veins, vomiting, irrability, mood swings, lack of concentration and the other horrible things this book tells you to expect. If you look up the word ""expect"" it the dictionary, it says: to rely on or look forward in recieving. Who looks forward to 9 months of misery?! I would recommend this book to young girls to scare them out of getting pregnant!"
1,This is a terrible book,"I read this book during my first pregnancy and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone -- I have a hard time believing it makes the bestseller list. There are three basic problems with this book. First, it promotes a philosophy that you are actively in control of the outcome of the pregnancy, as if pregnancy complications can be eliminated by being a control freak during pregnancy. Second, rather than being informative or reassuring it sent me to my doctor TWICE for no good reason, after reading the Q&A section for the month. Finally the diet recommend is much stricter than required for any normal pregnancy...no doubt if you can follow it you will be healthier, but pregnancy is a time of high stress and this book is only going to add to it. I would recommend ""The Well Pregnancy Book"" over ""What to Expect""."
4,Good read,"This is probably one of the better books we've come across. No wonder it's so popular.It will give you a good break down, month by month on what to expect and then goes into further detail after you've given birth.One of the great things is that this book has been updated numerous times. We have two (after a friend gave us an old copy) and comparing the two you can really see the updates are relevant and well worth including. If possible I would recommend buying the latest edition as it does include some updates that are either not in the old books or it updates techniques."
2,Unorganized,"When my wife got pregnant, this is what she heard was the best book to get. As an avid reader and seeing a volume of ""What to Expect"" books, I rushed to purchase it. While it helped solve some of our preliminary questions, afterwards it did nothing but instill fear into our minds.The book is not really organized in any reasonable way to ascertain the answers to specific questions, unless you want to wade through the index. It does answer many questions you might have, but it is impossible to find the answers sometimes.I was looking forward to a book that would really explain what to expect during each week or pregnancy, but I found this simply a huge FAQ book. I think it is best to just be read casually and not as a go to guide for certain questions you might have.I would not recommend this book and would urge you to find something more comprehensive. I hope this book gets less press as more options become available."
5,Absolutely loved it!,"I have read a few breastfeeding books and this is by far my favorite! Most of them are so hard to read through, that you only use them for reference, this one is filled with real life and relatable scenarios that it is actually enjoyable! I would recommend it all pregnant women!"
3,"Good, but not the best","Wow! People either love or hate this book. I am in the middle. It has pretty comprehensive coverage, but I agree the nutrition section is impossible. It was the best ten years ago, but now there are other great books out there. Best to get information from many different sources. I agree that The Pregnancy Book by the Sears is good for day to day concerns. If you want an interesting perspective of what is really going on in there, the best is How Life Begins--The Science of Life in the Womb by Chris Vaughan. This is particularly good for fathers who have trouble connecting to the day-to-day diet and exercise stuff."
3,Could be a little better.,Overall this book was pretty good. This is my first child so i like the part at the beginning of each month. However i dont like the best odds diet section. Im sure if i followed that i would be ill. I think you just need to be sensible and try to eat more fruit and veg. There is no need to go over the top. the book makes it sound if you dont eat all that you are a bad person.
3,Take with a grain of salt and don't get scared,"I found this book somewhat informative, being completely clueless about pregnancy. But I must say that the first time I picked it up and started to read it, I was scared out of having kids for 2 years. My doctor says the key to reading this book is to not read too far ahead of where you are in your pregnancy. It could use a bit more of a positive twist.As far as the Best-Odds diet, I think it could be revised a bit. It's important to try to eat as healthy as you can, but in the first trimester, I think just getting anything down is an important step. So, I took the diet with a grain of salt and just tried to eat sensibly without going overboard. If I felt like having a scoop of ice cream, I had one."
1,Never again,"When I was pregnant with my first child, I had this book, and I even had the follow-ups as my son grew. I have to say in hindsight, do NOT get this book. There are so many books that are tremendously good, more caring, and full of BETTER advice. The William and Martha Sears books for instance are wonderful. What to expect will leave you clueless when you're facing important decisions, and often more anxious than you need to be. The section on breastfeeding is particularly bad, and will have you wondering which end is up, and weaning your baby far sooner than recommended. Instead, try something by Katherine Dettwyler on breastfeeding, or the Sears Complete Pregnancy Book. You'll be much happier and better informed."
2,Buy it used,"or see if you can get someone to give you a copy if you feel the need to keep this ""pregnancy bible"" close at hand.The month-by-month format is helpful (then again, your experiences may vary somewhat).However, like many readers here, what really annoys me about this book is the tone in which it is written -- like all pregnant women are morons who jettisoned their sense of humor the minute the test came back positive.And the nutrition section is kind of a joke. I went from four months of morning sickness straight into persistent heartburn, so I made food choices based on what (1) didn't make me gag or (2) didn't keep me up all night belching. (Sometimes it was grapefruit, sometimes it was potato chips.)Relax a little bit -- constantly worrying about your weight or if you stood downwind from a car with a bad exhaust system isn't good for the baby either."
2,I hated this book,"My pregnancy started out a little bumpy, so needless to say I was always worried that something would go wrong. This book did nothing to calm my fears, it only exacerbated them. It made me feel like I could do nothing right, especially my diet. Just about everything I was eating was a ""no no"" according to this book, but then to others my diet was fine. I have heard this book called ""What to FEAR when you're expecting"" and I could'nt agree with that title more. I now have a wonderful happy 2 year old and I wish I had enjoyed my pregnancy more. There has got to be a better book out there."
3,Good Resource Book,"This book reads more as a resource rather than a ""read cover-to-cover"" kind of book. If you only get one pregnancy book, then this really isn't the one for you. Although I do find it useful, it's more towards looking up one thing here or another issue there. It's dense and very ""politically correct""."
5,Perfect Gift for the new expectant Mom,This has been a great resource for my daughter as she went through her 9 months of pregnancy
4,Like it but not enough,"The book has a lot of information very useful, especially because it is my first pregnancy. But I found the descripcion about was going on with the baby very general. I bought another book with this information week by week and I really appreciate it."
1,This book disgusts me.,"Do NOT buy this book. Here is a choice examples of advice in this stupid book: on ""eating well"" - you may occasionally treat yourself to a plain bagel, but everything else you eat must be much more unreasonably disgusting. Puh-leez. This book will list all the things that could go wrong at every stage of pregnancy, all the harm you are doing to your fetus every time you twitch a muscle, and much of it is highly unreasonable and overblown. If you want to stay up all night worrying that your baby will be deformed because of something that you did, go ahead and read it. But I would suggest: INSTEAD of this book, consult your doctor about any medical concerns, buy Dr. Spock's books, and buy the Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy (and to surviving the first year, and to toddlers, etc) by vicki iovine. You will get better-founded medical information and vicki iovine is also highly entertaining."
2,Not the book I'd recommend to friends.,"This book so put me off to pregnancy advice books that I've never attempted to read another. This book is preachy, extremist, alarmist, and way too rigid. It made me feel that if my pregnancy didn't progress exactly to their timeline than I was doing something wrong and harming my baby. The first chapters are especially irritating when talking about morning sickness and the Best_Odds diet. Basically with it telling me that whether I am sick or not I should be eating square meals. With me, that just wasn't going to happen and my baby is healthly, strong, and alert. My advice is find a good, experienced doctor that you feel comfortable with because they are going to give you the best advice that is suited to you and your specific needs. If you want a book to reference, I recommend a more medical oriented one like the Mayo Clinic book than an advice book."
1,Full of misinformation!,"This book is like a mixed bag of jellybeans, heavily weighted toward your least favorite flavor. Every now and then there is something good, but generally it is not enjoyable. Yes, it's nice to read that nosebleeds are normal, but more often I felt the expectations on the mother were unrealistic. Worst of all is the medical misinformation!Several times during my pregnancy I raised concerns with my doctor based on something in ""What to Expect..."" Every time the book was wrong! I had worried needlessly. There are better books out there for your medical information, and the Girlfriend's Guide for the practical (and funny) advice on hair and husbands. Don't rely on ""What to Expect when You're Expecting."""
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I wanted as much information as possible for my first pregnancy. The layout made it difficult to quickly find information and the writing of the book is horrible. All the cutesy analogies and comments were annoying and unnecessary.I was surprised to hear others comment that they found the book to have too much information that they found scary. Since I was looking for as much information as possible, I didn't mind that they covered every possibility since I knew that was what they were doing. I wanted to know about all the scenarios, good or bad, so I could be knowledgeable about my body's signals.Like I mentioned before, the book is very poorly organized and very very poorly written. An example of the poorly organized aspect of the book is that they talk about the importance of exercise along with diagrams of suggested exercises that are good for you quite late into the book when an exercise regimen can and should be followed in the first trimester."
2,Rather misleading...,"I found that even though this book is well organized and is easy to read, it does not provide risks, side affects, and natural alternatives for many medical procedures presented. It encourages kind of a wait and see attitude in terms of preparing for labor and birth instead of really providing the information in a factual way so that women and think about and make the best informed decisions regarding procedures and meds. I found that to be somewhat irresponsible."
1,Good overall knowledge; explains changes your body goes thru,"What to expect while you're expecting is a good, well rounded reference guide for the expectant mother. This book can be very reassuring for the first time mother who is not familiar with all the changes her body may be going through. It is also a very helpful reference if you suspect that something may be seriously wrong with you. Of course, the authors suggest seeing a physician immediately if something should go wrong- and this book is not intended to take the place of adequate medical care. The only thing this book really lacks is an adequate description of what the actual birth experience is like; for this I recommend, The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy (Iovine, 1995). This book is user friendly, and provides vicarious details of countless other women and their birth experiences. A good read."
5,Outstanding.,"The explanations are simple and easy to follow. In contrast to the reactions of some other reviewers, we found this book to be upbeat, and much less judgmental than the other pregnancy books. This book was actually reassuring compared to Lamaze, etc. Our doctor was a real jerk who believed in hiding any negative contingencies from the mother -- the ""Don't worry your pretty little head"" factor -- and it was a great comfort to have an objective resource to double check with, at our leisure and in a comfortable setting. As to a ""pro-doctor"" bias, I found this book to be tolerant of alternative medical care, as well as tolerant in general. It is written so that ANY person can take something away from it -- without feeling guilty about their own personal decisions -- and is not aimed at a niche audience."
2,Not too helpful.....,"This book is mostly other peoples questions and simple answers to them. It may be somewhat helpful to a first time mother with no experience but definitely not helpful to a second time Mom or someone more experienced looking for deeper answers to not so common questions. This book also says practically nothing about the growing baby inside you, the thing that interests me the most!"
4,"The Best ""to be Expected""","This was a wonderful book to read for ME, but as I learned after reading several books, is that there will never be one book that is the best for everyone. I'm a nurse and had worked briefly in OB. I was fairly confident throughout my pregnancy but very inquisitive. This book was perfect for me. But for anyone who is nervous and apprehensive and prone to psycho-somatic ideas (where you think every symptom is happening to you, when it really isn't)then this may not be the book for you. Some complained it spoke too much of horrific things that can happen but I had no problem reading these things as information, not prediction. It is a wonderful book for the right type of person. It is also an easy read."
2,Wow -incredibly condescending!,This book was SO preachy and condescending I could hardly stand to read it. Save your money and get the Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby instead.
1,Even Jenny McCarthy's book was better...,"Almost in to my 6th month of my first pregnancy and I can't give you one single thing that this book has done for me yet! If you are the atypical pregnancy with barely any pregnancy symptoms, this book definitely has nothing for you. (However for some people, who may have no medical background at all, it can be somewhat helpful on the tests that will be done and what they are for.) I was more interested in the ""how the baby is growing"" subject... which is not even addressed in this book. Also this book has alot of Q&A which are useless questions in most cases, and some of them make you wonder? But honestly the internet and your friends/family can give you better advice. Personally I think it is a waste of money, unless you get a free copy from a friend."
1,Who decided this was the ultimate pregnancy guide?,"And where are they so I can smack them?This book is a piece of garbage that is organized in a horrible fashion, has lots of fluff information, is preachy and condescending, and even SCARY at times. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.Apparently everyone at baby showers, all your friends and relatives (who haven't been pregnant recently), and everyone you pass on the street THINKS you need to have this book. But that means they clearly haven't had to use it! Warn your friends and family not to waste their money!A catchy title does not a helpful book make!If you are so unfortunate as to receive a copy of this book for free, DISCARD IT IMMEDIATELY without reading. You will feel worse about yourself and the pregnancy for having cracked it open."
5,MUST HAVE FOR ALL MOMS-TO-BE,"Every Mom-to-be will most likely read this book. It's engagine, easy to understand and helps with all phases of pregnancy. My own copy is dog-eared and well used. I appreciate the information on preterm labor. Knowledge and knowing what to expect goes a long way when you are experiencing pregnancy for the first time."
2,The Best-Odds Diet is enough to send me packing,"The rigid Best-Odds Diet advice must have been formulated to make every woman feel like a cow with no willpower. No bagels, even? Give me a break? It is way too rigid and makes it sound like you won't ever enjoy life again now that you're ""expecting."" A little common sense goes a long way, I figure.Feels like such an 80's book to me."
4,Very helpful book,"I enjoyed referring to this book when I was pregant. Very Informative. A must for pregnant women. I also greatly enjoyed ""Women's Health: Your Guide to a Healthier and Happier Life"" by Drs. David Newman and Holly Stevens for my other questions about women's issues. How to get ready for pregnancy? What happens after pregancy? Contraception and relationship issues. Also great book for menopause. I really enjoyed the true stories from women included in the book."
4,Very Helpfull!,This is a great book for 1st time mothers. It has helped me a lot with great advise and ideas I never thought of before. Very good read!
1,This Book made me feel like a failure.,"The diet is impossible to follow.( According to the ""Best Odds Diet"", If you Eat a piece of white bread it should be considered your one weekly treat.) The Question/Answer format makes it hard to look up specific things. Have the authors of this book actually been Pregnant?"
1,Why Can't I give 0 stars???,"They should change the title: What to freak you out with, when you are expecting!This book is all about telling you EVERYTHING that will go wrong!!!Motherhood is one of the most beautiful things that has happened to me; yes, it is hard, yes it can have complications, but you are better off asking your doctor about what might concern you. This book will go on explaining very rare things! that chances are, you will NEVER need to know about.Also, your imagination gets very active while pregnant (hormonal) and having all this negative information can trigger night terrors, and night mares.... talking by experience.My doctor forbid me from reading it any more.There are other books that will provide detail information about your current stages (and websites) without having to read through everything bad that can happen!"
1,Horror Show,"In my case, the idea of pregnancy was a little scary at first, so I bought this book in order to be as well informed as I could... the results were: a whole week crying in desperation and fear that all those awful things could happen to me at once, and the urge to burn the book in the fireplace at the first opportunity.Another thing that gave me shivers was the authors' obsession with the nearly demonic effects of eating refined sugar. It seems that all problems in pregnancy are caused by sugar... It's amazing to think how millions of women throughout the decades have had so many kids and are still alive, in spite of their sinful sugar consumption.Luckily, I have understanding people around me who eased off my mind from the horrors of pregnancy. Now I am prepared to enjoy every stage of this awesome part of my life. With another book, of course."
2,Uhhh..a little too much information?,"As grandma says, ""Read it and you'll begin to believe it"" If you're expecting stay away from this book, especially a first pregnancy. It's info. overload & most situations will not pertain to you! I still have the helpful (skinny) booklet on pregnancy my insurance company sent to me years ago--the first time I was expecting. It gives you the basics w/ some encouraging words as well. A good dr. who is caring, reassuring...is the best advice source!"
3,Try Another Book,This book was my first purchase when I found out I was pregnant. I had to put the book away after the first few chapters due to the alarmist writing style of the three authors. Being pregnant for the first time can be intimidating enough. Now factor into the equation this book and you may just really freak about what lies ahead for you. The book tends to focus on the problems associated with pregnancy and what can go wrong as opposed to all that can go right. I believe a pregnant woman needs a lot of positive feedback during this wonderful time. The book just doesn't provide that. I would not recommend reading this book prior to getting pregnant as it just may work as the most effective method of birth control around today.There are a couple of helpful chapters such as the three stages of labor. But I think that one can find both an informative book combined with positive feedback from the author(s) elsewhere.
2,I found this book very condescending,"Every pregnancy is different, including how much weight a woman puts on. There are so many variables, and yet the authors of this book again and again generalize and imply that any woman who puts on more weight than THEY recommend has been sitting around snacking on bon-bons and watching television. What about a woman who is simply too sick to get out of bed with her pregnancy? I found myself increasingly frustrated and insulted by the constant, smug rehashing of this issue.My ob-gyn and perinatal care coordinator both pooh-poohed this one, too, specifically because of these broad generalizations."
1,It wasn't helpful.,"I bought this, right after I found out I was pregnant. I'm not in the medical field and thought it would be helpful.I did like the beginning of each chapter of ""what to expect this month"". Other then that it didn't address much of anything that helped me. I found all the information I used online or from other women. I felt the information in this book was stuff you hear anyway from other women, or in your classes."
3,Kind of Boring Don't do this Don't do that...,This book was pretty boring even though it had an abundant amount of information. It's mostly a do not do list. My husband hated reading it because the way they wrote it is so old school and boring. Good to have as a backup resource...we also bought the Everything book of Pregnancy.
3,Missing helpful information,"I was very disappointed to see that book has very little information on group B strep testing and treatment. Everything else was pretty helpful, but a common pregnancy condition that can potentially be dangerous during labor and delivery should be covered in this book in my opinion. For everything else, this book has been like my bible. But very disappointed in the lack of info regarding group B strep. There is an enormous and detailed section on pregnancy ailments and complications and it seems to cover everything else. Very surprised and disappointed."
4,Very Informative,"This book is very informative but it also gives too much info. It does seem to focus to much on the negative possible dangers, risks, and side affects of pregnancy. It does have some useful info but I skipped all of the negative parts unless I was dealing with that issue."
3,Not worth it for full price,"I got this book because it was so hyped and I have to say there are far far better ones out there! It reads poorly and seems to be condescending and points out all that can go wrong with you pregnancy. I would stick with The Mother of All Pregnancy Books by Ann Douglas and Your Pregnancy Week by Week by Glade B. Curtis, Judith Schuler. I would buy What to Expect When You're Expecting only if I found it used or at a great sale price and use it only as a reference. Do not make it the only book you buy!"
3,"Useful, but a bit scary","A useful book, it gave an overview of what to expect each month, and then went into more detail in some areas. The only thing I didn't like is that it was a little scary regarding some of the things that can go wrong! It is good to be informed, but the book didn't really give enough information (e.g. the likelihood of THIS happening is 1%, and that sort of thing). We made a somewhat panicky visit to the doctor because of it. As long as the reader is aware of this, then I'd recommend it."
1,No wonder there's a backlash against this book,"It's no wonder so many people are getting fed up with this book. I can't believe how obnoxious the authors can be at times. Here's a direct quote: ""Before you close your mouth on a forkful of food, consider: 'Is this the best bite I can give my baby?' If it will benefit your baby, chew away. If it'll only benefit your sweet tooth or appease your appetite, put your fork down.'"" Why is this book a bestseller?"
4,Great Primer to Parenthood,"There are more than 1000 titles in Amazon under parenthood, and I feel this is the best-written, most helpful guide to the beginner parent. Every Mom and Dad will have a few key chapters they return to over and over, and large portions of the book they ignore. Here are two more books you can't live without--first, the funniest and most insightful book ever written about parenting, ""I SLEEP AT RED LIGHTS: A TRUE STORY OF LIFE AFTER TRIPLETS,"" by Bruce Stockler, a really amazing and unique book about how parenthood changes your life forever; and Operating Instructions, by Annie LaMott, the first and best-written of the parenting memoirs."
1,Way TOO much lecturing.,"I bought several pregnancy books when I first found I was pregnant not including this one. My doctor highly recomended this book so I added it to my collection and I hate this book. Even though it does have a lot of good information it is very condescending. Whenever I looked up any topic I felt like I was being lectured. To me it seemed to be negative overall. I would highly recomend the book ""The Mother of All Pregnancy Books"" over this one."
2,Seems Old,"The cover looks old, the pictures are pretty lame. The information seems accurate, but the presentation is poor."
1,What to Expect when your a Wussy Parent,"This whole series of books, we got for free from my wife's OBGYN. A shame the books weren't made out of different paper, they would have made great kindling.If you ain't a red meat eating, flag waving, butt spanking, gun loving American, then yea I suppose you'd like this book.Would you like Tofu with that order?"
3,"If it's free, fine, but probably not worth more than four bucks","When I was not pregnant I thought of this as THE book for pregnant women. Once I got pregnant I realized that it left a lot of holes in the story, had a weird flow to it, and really only made two or three points over and over and over and over.If you're looking for a gift for your baby-crazy friend who won't be having kids anytime really soon but still wants to dream, get this. If you want something for your pregnant friend, don't waste your money.There are a million other books with actual information, organized in a logical manner, and displayed in a slightly less ""friend-y"" way. Please, go for them first and if you still feel like you need this one after reading a real reference (perhaps written by medical professionals) go ahead and buy this. But don't pay full price, I beg you."
1,Terrible--vague and too wordy.,"This is a terrible book. My informal survey of friends shows that women scientists and engineers tend to hate this book. It's wordy, it's filled with obvious common sense suggestions, and it lacks precise information. This book insulted my intelligence and wasted my time."
2,Living Life through a Plastic Bubble......,"I'll be honest, I really don't like this book! When I was pregnant with my first child, it was, as a previous reveiwer put it, my ""bible"". Now, having gone through pregnancy and being pregnant with my second child, I find the book rather depressing! Pregnancy is suppose to be a time of joy, getting familiar with the changes in you body and the life that is growing inside you, etc. Instead of listing all the things a pregnant woman has to look forward to, this book is filled with a lot of ""No!"" and ""Don't"".I recommend instead reading the Sears Family Library's book on pregnancy!"
3,"NOT FOR EVERYONE, BY ANY MEANS","&QUOT;WHAT TO EXPECT&QUOT; MAY BE FINE FOR SOME, BUT I FOUND IT PRETTY EXCLUSIONARY: IF YOU ARE NOT MARRIED OR HETEROSEXUAL, YOU WILL LOOK IN VAIN FOR ANY REFERENCE TO YOUR LIFE. AND MOTHERS-TO-BE, BE WARNED--THE BOOK HAS A JUDGEMENTAL TONE THAT CAN REALLY HIT YOU HARD WHEN HORMONES ARE AT HIGH TIDE. I COULDN'T BREASTFEED, AND THE CHAPTER ON BREASTFEEDING MADE ME FEEL LIKE A CHILD-MURDERER."
3,A little let down.,"I purchased this book with great hope that it would give me answers to all the questions of Pregnancy. Seems like all it did was tell me the same things...symptoms...what is going on...how I should be feeling. For my it was not worth the money. I purchased ""Your pregnancy week by week"" and it was MUCH better. Gave a lot more information about what was happening with my body and also the length and weight (later) of the baby and what was developing each week."
1,Terrible,"If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy."
2,a great book to read if you like to be frightned,"I am a mother of six children, I read this book with baby number three. I was scared out of my wits. I didn't need the hassle. I think that educating your self about chidbirth is a good thing, but, it gets to the point in this book that you are afraid of EVERYTHING. I was worried about every test I didn't have, I was worried about every test I DID have. I think this book should have focused on basic need to know details, especially for first time mothers who really worry to begin with. There is such a thing as too much info to take in and digest."
3,Over 35 First -Time Mom with too much time to evaluate stuff for Baby due in May,"I received this book from my friend when I first announced I was pregnant. Although it is a good guideline, it should not be regarded as an information ""bible"". Just keep in mind that this is a guideline not a ""know-it-all"" book. Although it includes a lot of good, basic ""black and white"" information, there is a lot of ""gray"" that is left out. This book brought out the ""worry-rat"" in me when I used the index to find out if certain things were normal in pregnancy. I have seen other books out there which offer better information and indices for quick reference."
5,Great Book and resource,This book is awesome and answers alot of questions one may have during their pregnancy. It covers everything. I am very pleased with this book.
2,What to Avoid,This book actually says that it is okay to imbibe while pregnant. I showed my midwife and she was livid.
2,very negative view of pregnancy,"I found that this book spent too much time dealing with the negative aspects of pregnancy, and far too little time discussing the positives. I have made many sacrifices for my pregnancy and for the life of my baby, but still felt as if I was making mistakes at every turn because of this book. After discussing my issues with my doctor, he assured me that my diet and lifestyle was more than satisfactory for me and my baby. He advised me to put the book on my shelf, and consult it if I had a medical concern that I wanted to research before contacting him. This is what I have done, and I haven't opened it since. I've turned to Dr. Sears ""The Pregnancy Book"" where I have found the information to be more thorough, and far more positive. Yes, ""What to expect..."" has some useful information, but if you want a more positive view of your pregnancy, you may want to look elsewhere."
3,So So Okay,"I'm more of an emotional reader so I liked ""The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"" better. This book talked about all the things I didn't need to worry about. What normal mother needs to worry about drugs and pregnancy. I skipped the entire section. It seemed like common sense to me. It was dry reading in my opinion. It still had some good facts. It's one you keep in your library just in case. If you're looking for facts and laughs read ""The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"" it's laugh out loud funny and easy to relate to."
2,Only if you know NOTHING about pregnancy,"I'm a first time Mom-to-be, and I must admit, the hype surrounding this book pushed me to purchase it, but I was somewhat disappointed. It's not the sort of book that held my attention, only because a lot of the information is oversimplified. If you have a simple a question about something and you need a general answer, this book is OK. But the format of question - answer, question - answer, just wasn't appealing at all. It's written in a boring and condescending tone. The month-by-month guide is misleading as well. There's great information, but not well organized in each month.If you don't know very much about your body or what pregnancy is about, then this may be an informative book for you to read. Otherwise, it's not as essential as everyone makes it out to be. Save your money. Don't buy this book."
2,Not sure this is THE BEST reference out there...,"This is my first pregnancy and the repeated contradictions in this book left me more confused and with more questions then answers. If you can help it, try to borrow this one and buy a second reference to balance out the contradictions."
1,Alternate Title: Everything You've Done Will Harm Your Baby,"This book had me upset from pre-conception to post-miscarriage. After losing my first baby I came home from the hospital and literally threw this book across the room, next stop was the garbage can. I have never been so paraniod in my life as when I read this book. Do yourself a favor and read ""The Girlfriend's Guide To Pregnancy"" (Iovine) or ""The Pregnancy Book"" (Sears). Although I'm mostly joking when I say this..I think the stress from the ""What To Expect..."" book was the cause of my miscarriage."
2,This book is not that great.,"This book was recommended to me by many people. It was not at all what I expected. It has a tendancy to focus on what could be negative in your pregnancy. If you are looking for a book to read I would try ""The Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy"""
1,First Time Fathers don't buy this Book for the Mother,This book plain makes your parinoid. What you don't know will not hurt you. This book is down right terrifying. I am not sure why its on every women's to read list when they are expecting. Nothing like giving a moody women a book with a list of everything that could possibly go wrong. There is such a slim chance that anything will go wrong that its not worth the high blood pressure. Find a good doctor and ask questions.
4,Encouraging and Helpful Resource,"I wasn't going to write this until I read all of the reviews calling this book scary. I didn't get that at all. I received the book as a gift and read it pretty quickly. It is organized by month and since all symptoms or problems don't happen at the same time for everyone, I find my self using the index and finding the information that way.The thing that dropped a star for me is the diet. I already quit smoking and cut down my caffeine. I am not following the diet.The only thing that is scary is the section for Serious Problems, etc. But it says on the first page of the section not to read it if you are not having problems."
4,Good book for First time moms,"I got this book even before i got the postive pregnancy test. My only complaint is that some of the questions women ask are so dumb, but i guess at some point someone will think of it and this book will answer them. Other problem is that some questions aren't always going to apply to your type of situation and the questions may startle you, i know some made me a little uncomfortable. Thats just me though. All around good book though. :)"
2,"Informative, but a Lousy Bedside Manner","Probably no other pregnancy book gives the reader more information. But there's probably no other pregnancy book with such a condescending attitude toward the parent. ""What to Expect"" assumes that no pregnant woman has anything better to do than serve as a baby factory, and the authors practically ignore fathers completely.If you want to have a healthy baby and you also want to get through pregnancy with your self-esteem intact, go to another pregnancy book for everyday matters and read ""What to Expect"" only when you need in-depth information."
2,Take it with a grain of salt,"When I first picked up this book, back in December, 2000, I was so upset by the content that I threw it across the room, vowing never to pick it up again. Since that time, however, my perspective has changed. Within every dark cloud there is a glimmer of light; similarly, within What To Epect When You Are Expecting there are useful pieces of information. The ""Best-Odds"" diet, for instance, is useful, with certain modifications, while the reference section towards the back is helpful.Be sure, however, to stay away from the section on all that can go wrong. What a way to scare a preganat woman!What To Expect When You're Expecting can be a useful refernce book...just be sure to use your common sense."
2,The tone of this book puts me off.,"I agree with many of the other people who have reviewed this book. Although some of the information is helpful, the tone of the book is very preachy and condescending. I invariably become offended every time I read more than a few pages of this book."
2,Its not that great...,"I bought this book because I thought it was a standard thing for all newly pregnant people. I have used it as a resource here and there, but for the most part, it wasn't that helpful."
2,What to Expect When You're Expecting the Worst,"All doom and gloom. Takes all the fun out of being pregnant and keeps you up at night worrying about the what-ifs. Perhaps it's handy to have around as an additional reference for particular situations (I looked at it when I was Group B Strep positive, for example), if you can get your hands on a hand-me-down copy. Buy the Dr. Sears book instead!"
4,Excellent choice for youth,"I was almost scared away from this CD by some of the negative customer reviews here on Amazon, but I am so glad I bought This is Your Time for my family.The album is a great choice for youth; Michael W. Smith's stated intention was that this would be suitable for a specific age group, and I suppose in some senses, spiritual maturity levels. (Though some songs can be listened to on a deeper level.)There is huge need for Christian music for youth too old for ""Kiddy Albums,"" but not ready or interested in heavy, complicated metaphors or sophisticated, alternative-style music.Had a real Nik Kershaw sound to it, too, which I really enjoyed . . ."
4,Michael did good!,"Not his best album in my opinion (but I like his love ballads more so then his other stuff) Which is why I rated it a four and not a five. The almost...salsa urban feel on the second or third track kinda threw me, and some of his lyrics seemed a little more shallow then in previous albums.Theres a good 4 or 5 songs on here that I love to death. The rest well...maybe if I need to get happy. Buy this cd if your a hardcore fan. If your new to MWS, grab his ""Decade"" albums."
4,Another Solid Album,"Smitty has struck gold again with ""This Is Your Time"". I bought this album the first day it came out and I haven't stopped listening to it since. It seems that MWS reinvents his style with every album he does. In some respects, ""This Is Your Time"" is very different sounding from ""Live the Life"", his previous hit album. Electric guitar-rock feel is a lot more prevalent in the songs here. The title track is by far the most poignant. And songs such as ""Anna"", ""She Walks With Me"", ""I Will Be Your Friend"", ""I Will Carry You"", and ""Hey You It's Me"" all add to this album tremendously. ""Everybody Free"" and ""Still Have the Dream"" are also great songs. Is it as good as ""Live the Life""? No. But we have to wonder if anything Smitty does can ever top that album. In short, ""This Is Your Time"" is a must have, probably the second best album of his career next to ""Live the Life""."
5,The Best American Short Story Writer,"If you love O'Connor, you should own this, and if you have never read O'Connor, buy this book and begin ASAP! O'Connor's stories expose the complexities and frailties of being human, and you'll be struck by their profundity, a profundity that I find sorely missing in modern short stories (I've been reading the fiction issue of ""The New Yorker""). But perhaps what I love most about O'Connor is her sense of humor. One of her most anthologized stories, ""A Good Man is Hard to Find,"" is as funny as it is dark (I'm thinking of the scene when ""a horrible thought"" occurs to the grandmother in the car). O'Connor is simply one of the best short story writers of the 20th century."
1,To be honest ...,"Flannery O'Connor is an amazing writer. Please, buy her work and read it. But do NOT buy this book.Whoever compiled this has a love for Flannery that I can appreciate, but the book itself is horrible. It's full of typographical errors; it doesn't get the name of one her novels right half the time (it's Wise Blood, not ""The Wise Blood""); it seems self-published, judging by the back cover blurb and the fact it's published through CreateSpace. I'm not sure it's even legal. I would be shocked to find out it is.I never bother writing negative reviews, but I found this book highly distressful."
2,Decent as long as you don't read more than one at a time,"I highly suggest that if you wish to enjoy this woman's stories you follow the advice of an earlier review. Read them one at a time. If you don't you'll figure out the same thing I did, it's really basically one story about a woman who screws up everything for her family over and over again with the names changed.Whether it's the dead daughter in ""The Artificial Nigger,"" the too astute grandmother in ""A Good Man"" or the embarrassingly incompetent farm women, or the despicable mothers and their even more flat and dreary college educated children, Flannery can't seem to do anything other than recycle herself and the people that annoyed her into the same drek over and over. (Yes, I realize that was a run on sentence).Just remember, the writer being dead doesn't mean their work is great."
3,The Complete Stories,Ordered 2-14-2007 and just rec'd. 3-19-2005. Have not had an opportunity to read this book due to the long delivery time.Book arrive in very good condition as described.
4,Sturdy case,Got this to protect my Motorola L6 phone. It fits the phone like a glove. I also love that it protects the phone screen. The only complaint is that the case open easily if it's dropped or handled in a rough way. Clear tape on the seams can easily take care of that. My toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it. The case still does not have a chip or crack on it.
1,This book not only sucks it blows,"If you think this book is going to be another Divine Secrets Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood or Little Alters Everywhere, forget it. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. This book sucks."
5,The Toothpaste Millionaire,"The Toothpaste Millionaire by Jean Merrill was one of the best books I ever read. After the first page I knew this was going to be a great book. I liked the character Rufus. He did not care that Kate was white and he was black. He did not like to waste anything. He was very creative, and figured out a really cool way for a kid to make a million dollars. The plot was interesting and exciting, and the ending was unpredictable. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy being creative, or who want to make a lot of money. If this book has a sequel, I am going to read it. I'm also going to check out other books by this author."
4,Great for playing sports or working out,"Great for playing sports or working out. Its small, it does its job, and comfortable."
4,Great Cult Anime,"not everyone would like this series, but i think it's awesome! the characters are fun... and the animation style is a cool mix of anime, and... well it honestly remindes me of the Batman cartoon series in some ways. gothic and fun... and home of the coolest car ever!"
3,O'Baby: The IRish BAby Name Book by Geoffrey Johnson,I purchased this book for my stepson & his wife when they were expecting their firstborn -- I assume they found the 3 books quite useful -- I did not personally read it
3,"Not what I expected, but ok","This is a good book if it is the first or only one you'll get. I did not like the sections, I found myself using the index then looking up the names. The one section I did like was the ""translation from English to Irish"" section. The pronunciations were great, but a few were different than I have HEARD them pronounced. I bought this book to look for more names, but I find the website [...] has most of the same names, and you can hear the pronuncations. I'm glad I got my copy used."
2,Rough at best,"Only mildly accurate, the clumsy mix of true Gaelic forms along with Anglicizations leaves me a bit put off. This might make it useful to many, but it is not at all formal in structure. There are also some names with variations given that are just ridiculously old. Noone uses the root 'dub' in place of 'dubh.' Some truly ancient names are included, but their selections are random. It appears to be mostly gloss from a few limited sources."
2,Was okay for first 9 months.,"This unit worked fine for the first nine months we had it. Then, we kept getting an HO1 error. The DVD would act like it was starting then the entire player would shut off. We read the manual, which was no help. Called Panasonic for tech support. They said the laser is probably misaligned from a drop or putting something hot on the unit (neither happened). They said we could send the unit (at our cost) to them and they would charge us for parts and for labor OR we could purchase a new player for $100. Since we'd only had the player for nine months and had treated it wonderfully, neither choice seemed acceptable. We are not satisfied with the way Panasonic handled this case. Basically, we had DVD watching for less than a year and we'll have to purchase a new player. It certainly won't be from Panasonic."
5,excellent,close to two year of very heavy use not one problem. reads better than the high end sony we got at twice the price.
2,known defect - tends to die within 12 - 24 months,"I bought this DVD player in July 2003 and enjoyed it until Apr 2005, when it stopped working with a ""HO2 - NO DISC"" error.It turns out that premature death is a common problem with this player. A search on ""Panasonic DVD-S35"" and ""NO DISC"" will bring up these reviews.Reviewers share a common complaint -- the player is great for the first year, and then dies (I got 18 months out of mine).I strongly advise that you do not buy one of these used, as it is unlikely to last even a full year.--Pat"
4,Not very reliable,"This product worked for sometime but stopped working one day, i had to buy another brand."
5,Reel Deal Slots 2,"I was so excited. Even though it was 11:00pm I had to runthrough a couple of games. I loved it, it is so real almost like being at the casino. I am staying home tonight from Bingo just so I can go through most of the games tonight."
4,reel deel slots is the real deal,the game was great very innovative all of the latest slot machines very up to date and quite challenging
4,It was an immortal squad but it is immortal,There is a lot more depth to this movie than you would expect. Yes it is a [biased] movie. But it portrayed the beginning of the breakdown of the class system in England. David Nine plays a junior officer than was from a civilian brigade and now must learn to get along with his Sergeant and men. He goes from aloofness to comrade by the end of the movie. There is plenty of action as the troop transport that they are on gets torpedoed. And they even get to fix bayonets.
4,Great series of books for medical students,I've been using these books and they've helped me learn the clinical pictures of how diseases present--an ideal set of books to study for the USMLE Step 1. I would recommend this book to all medical students.
5,Best VISUAL C# book,this books provides the basic of c# programming knowledge.i'm a student that just start IT course and I think that this book suit for me.. as it is easy to be understand..the part that i dont like at this book is the first 12 chapters. I skipped it as that one is console-based.. i first read the chapter 14-24.. after i've read the chapter 14-24 then i just start to read the chapter 1-12... (for me the chapter 1-12 is not for beginner.. the chapter that will be the foundation is chapter 13!!)i like the part of how did they give the example and guide .. overall this book is the best visual c# book... compared with teach urself c# in 21days.. (i bought wrox book first before i bought the teach urself c#)
3,"Hey, Karli. Get a haircut !","Is this really the best way to learn C#? Chapter after bloody chapter about the nuts & bolts of every variable type, class contruct and OOP concept. The reader tests their new-found knowledge building console apps until Forms are mercifully introduced on page 340.I think a much better way to learn is to start with a simple form app (like ""Hello, World"") and introduce new material step-by-step.Not that this is a bad book. Hustler magazine doesn't show this level of detail. The authors explore every nook & crevice of a subject and there are plenty of code snippets to illustrate each new concept.This could be a good companion book. But not a first book. If you want to get off the ground quickly, start with ""Windows Forms Programming in C#"" by Chris Sells. Otherwise, this book will keep you on the launch pad for months."
2,Man did the crue ever suck at first,Listening to Vince Neil's horrific wailing is enought to make just about any glam fan puke. Its hard to believe they ever made it to the top considering how much his voice clearly sucks. The riffs and the music still kickstarts my heart but sheesh come on vince. Sound quality is poor but song selection is great. Amust have for any Crue collector who has a few extra dollars to waste.
2,Booooooooooring,"Loved the movie, but this novelization adds nothing new and really lacks the charm that the actors bring to the dialogue. In fact, it's an almost word-for-word adaptation. Go buy the movie instead. It's a much better value."
5,Superb,"An unusual novelization of a film after its theatrical release, that also happens to be written by its director/writer. By telling the story of the movie from the point of view of one of its characters -- who knows about the movie, its script, and various other background materials -- The Last Days of Disco, with Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards actually improves upon what was an excellent, enjoyable film to begin with. But don't be concerned that this is some trite post-modern, deconstructionist gobbledygook, because Stillman is just as talented a novelist as he is a filmmaker, and he allows the wonderful, affecting story about a group of young people finding their way in the world hold center stage. Set against his marvelous descriptions of New York City at night, and its early 1980s club scene, along with the great dialogue Stillman's films are known for, Stillman's novelization of his own film succeeds greatly on its own."
5,Moonlight Classics,Bought this for my husband for Christmas...He has played it daily since then. Very romantic and passionate music. He especially enjoys the piano pieces.
4,It's the bomb!,"Conejo's music is different, unique, creative, and subliminal. His hip hop style is dope and his CD is bombaaaaayy!"
5,Outstanding,"Is Defending the Spirit a memoir, a history lesson, or an objective critique? It's all these things. Among men like my father, Frederick Douglass, and Martin Luther King, Jr., Randall Robinson has become one of my heroes. He has managed to make US foreign policy accessible. Sadly, the bliss of ignorance is gone and in it's wake is the question 'why are we treated so bad?'"
2,Great music shame about the sound,"I like this type of 1960's teenage music every now and then. However, after a while it can become a bit monotonous but that is not my problem with this. The artists and their interpretations seem to remain close to the originals.I would rate the music as very good and I would have given this CD at least a four star but I've paid top money for this as an out of print CD. I have suffered complete disappointment after playing it and discovering the sound quality left a lot to be desired. This CD sounds like a heavily compressed MP3 file. It is certainly not something you will enjoy on a large set up, I haven't tried it in the car but I do regret buying it just because of the poor sound quality."
4,Encyclopedic Telecom Reference,"Horak's third edition updates an ambitious and comprehensive treatise of the subject. If you need an encyclopedic reference work on telecommunications and networking, then this book's for you. Very detailed. I like the historical perspective: does a good job of explaining the transition from analog, circuit-switched networking to today's increasingly digital, packet-based, convergent applications. I also like the ""plain-English"" style, personal anecdotes and revelations from the author's lengthy telecom career. The organization/morphology is OK; certainly competent given the rapid changes occuring in this industry. It is extremely well indexed and referenced, however, so zeroing-in on specific topics is not difficult. Deserves a spot on any student or professional bookshelf."
3,Average intro. Lots of typos and errors.,"This text is not all bad, but the numerous typos and factual errors earn it a low mark. For example the author states that IPv4 does not support multicast (it does), that the format's 32 bits ""will serve addressing needs into the next century"" (p. 379). The Internet chapter is very bad.The writing style itself is often unclear, and one gets the strong impression that several chapters were rushed without adequate proofreading. A typical sentence: ""In the highly-competitive Frame Relay market, mesh networking that can be accomplished at costs which can be as little as 50% of the cost of a comparable FT-1 network."" (p. 292).I could go on and on, but you should get the idea. If a future edition fixes the numerous problems, then this book may become a decent intro. In the mean time, look elsewhere, possibly to one of the standard texts like Stalling's ""Data & Computer Communications"" or Bates' ""Voice and Data Communications Handbook""."
3,Light reading,"There are many telecom books around that try cover as much as topics as possible, this one is no different.Main advantage of Ray Horak's book is it simplicity, it is very easy to read and understand and organization of the overall text is also quite good. Book also covers fairly large portion of today's telecom world, although, due to the sheer size of the subject, it is lacking in details.I'd recommend this book for junior (very junior) students or for new-commers in the field.On the other hand, european engineers should try to avoid this book due its US-centrism. Author mostly ignores European systems or provides very shallow and short reference.To finalize, good book, but don't ecpect it to make you an expert in the field."
1,"The Scapegoat, a review","This book is dumb. I hated it. Please do not read it unless you enjoy falling asleep in the middle of the day. I'd rather watch 20 episodes of ""Charles in Charge"" in a row than read even so much as the cover again."
5,Impressive,A noble effort in the attempt to bring Buddhist thought into western minds of the 19th century. A lovely tome.
3,Should have paid attention,"by previewing the songs before buying. Based on the titles, I thought they'd be in Portuguese, but they're in Spanish. The songs are still beautiful, just not what I thought I was buying."
2,"3 star movie,1 star release","I was glad this was on DVD but an on demand DVD-R should make up for its dubious origins with good quality or a least a facsimile thereof, in short it doesn't. This movie isn't exactly horror platinum but it is a fondly remembered renter from the old VHS 80s and deserves a better treatment. This DVD is literally like peeling back the pages as it is VHS to DVD and especially on new equipment is next to unwatchable. The sound and image are muddied to the the point where you will yearn for the clarity of 25"" cathode ray tube over this abusive tranfer. I thank AMAZON for throwing in a digital rental of the same title but it is the same FULL FRAME nightmare as the DVD-R. Disappointing, guess its time to watch the NIGHT OF THE CREEPS blu-ray again."
3,Was It Beautiful? Book Review,"The story was slow and not very interesting in the beginning two-thirds of the book. I kept waiting for something more to happen. It ended with an attempt to make you contemplate life's greatest mysteries. Overall, this was a good read."
1,pathetic,the writing was dry and boring and i bought this to learn about Blavatsky and he only gave a brief introduction to her in the first couple of chapters and then meandered on and on about the history of how the the theosophical club came about and all the people involved in it. The title should have reflected the focus of the book which is not on blavatsky but on theosophists historically in general
5,The Ultimate,This album and Entombed's - Left Hand Path are the 2 best Death Metal albums ever created.
2,"Not ideal ""self-study"" book for undergrads","The book does a poor job at laying out the basics for the reader. In the first chapter only 2 pages out of 33 are dedicated to describing the theory, the rest of the chapter consists of word problems. Some of those word problems go beyond the scope of the theory outlined for you, to which I thought was not only unfair but a bit intimidating to the curious math student. Sadly, the majority of this book follows the same routine.From this layout it was clear that this book wasn't written with the complete novice in mind. The Discrete Math [also a Schaum's outline] book I bought alongside this one happens to cover the same topics and does a much better job at explaining the basics with reasonable problems to practice from.As I said before, I can't recommend this book to anyone who is looking to break way into Combinatorics."
1,HO2 Error strikes again,"I have had this DVD player for almost 18 months. After 1 month I got an H02 error, Called Panasonic for help and got the worst customer service I have ever experienced, all they would provide is the address to authorized service centers. Sent it in and got it repaired under warranty (about 3 weeks to get it back). Now after a year the H02 error strikes again, no longer under warranty I am going to junk it. Look at other reviews (epinions, etc..) This H02 error is all over, I will never buy another Panasonic product. If not for the errors the product worked fine and would appear to be a good value."
5,Pop with a twist of Rock,"Backstreet Boys one of the biggest pop bands wowed the girls all around the world with their love songs, now its time for Nick Carter one of the Backstreet Boys to break off his shell and show us a different side of him. Nick Carter's new album Now or Never shows just what amazing talant this 22 year old rock star has. The album has a pop sound wiht a mix of rock and techno. A new fling in pop music. Stilling wowing the girls of the world but with a different a definitly better flavor!!! If you are a big fan of Bryan Adams and pop music you should defiently get this album!"
5,amazing work...,I bought now or never I was thinking the usual bsb sound but when nick carter went solo he changed the sound a lot. its got an edgy feel to some of the songs which sounds awesome i dont think he could have done a better job plus you get a cool dvd with it that explains some of his songs and why he wrote them its very awesome
3,"It's an alright album, but...","Back in 2002, I was expecting the solo release of Nick Carter. The project ""Now or Never"" is a great start for what he wanted to do, but at the same time, I feel that he never should have released anything solo while still in the group.So many rumors were spread saying that the Backstreet Boys broke up, and I thought that to be true. I used to like Nick Carter back in the day, but now, I'm all out of sorts with him, and here's why:-The solo venture-On the ""Making the Video: Help Me"" segment, he said while he was in the group, HIS career went nowhere.If he didn't notice, the BSB's IS his career, and it felt to me as if he blew them off, or his ego got too big, I don't know.All of the songs on there are pretty good, but I still have animosity towards him over the timing, sometimes his mouth, and the whole release altogether."
4,Damn good for a BSB member,"Yes, I hate BSB, their wussy music annoys me and I can't stand most of the songs. I'm a big fan of cKy and Treephort, but I found this CD to be actually quite good. My sister has it and listens to it 24/7, so thats how I got my listen. After hearing ""Justified"" from Justin Timberlake, I was not in the mood to hear another boy band member gone solo, but once I got my first full listen to the CD, I was pretty impressed. Good one, Nick."
5,Nick surprised me,"I think Nick did a great job! He wrote some amazing songs and his voice is very touching. I love "" Do I have to cry for you"", it's really breathtaking. No matter how the album will do in the chats, it's already a success"
5,One in a million,I fell in love with Nick Carter's Now or Never the first time I heard it. The sweet pop ballad mixed with the rocky in-your-face songs make it a one in a million CD. Definately worth the buy.
2,Bad Joke,"The only good song is ""Help Me"" the rest of the album is a big joke. I love Nick Carter but I don't love this cd. He should just stick with the group and not go solo"
5,"""My Confession""","This hot new cd from Nick Carter is sure to ""Blow your mind."" I listen to it all the time. It has such a tight edgy sound that anyone is sure to like. It ventures away from the typical Backstreet Boys sound but that's why I like it. I like all the different styles of music he has to offer as well, proving that he is capable of singing almost anything. So guys ""Help Me"" and Nick out by checking out his exciting, hightly anticipated new cd. It's ""Now or Never."""
5,"Buy this CD, it's awesome!","I really loved this whole entire CD, and I feel that Nick did a very good job of branching out from The Backstreet Boys. There were a few songs that were too Backstreetish for my liking, but the other material was great. ""Miss America"" is one of the best songs in my opinion due to the fact that it's mellow, but has some good lyrics. ""Do I Have To Cry For You"" is a nice song, but it seems too much like ""I Need You Tonight"" from Backstreet Boys CD, Millenium. The first single off of it, ""Help Me"" is the best song on this disc. It's a upbeat song, but some of the lyrics in this song are kind of nonsense, and don't make a lot of logical sense. Any fan of Nick's will love this disc. I give it five stars."
5,AWESOME AWESOME CD!!! I LOVE NICK CARTER AND BSB!!!,This album is incredible!! Definitely worth buying if you are or aren't a fan. I've been a fan of Nick and BSB for 10 years now..as long as they've been together....and I've enjoyed every album they've done. Even though Nick is by himself on this album it's still amazing and he's an excellent songwriter/singer. I recommend this album to anyone and everyone and I'm soooo proud of Nick for this album. This is an album everybody should own.....young and old. It's got a great sound and I love it! I love Nick and BSB with all my heart!!
4,A great debut!!!,"Well....here it is...the debut solo album from [Nick Carter] 1/5 of the pop group, THE BACKSTREET BOYS. It is a guilty pleasure from start to finish! The uptempo anthem HELP ME is standard good pop fare as well as MY CONFESSION....his strengths here, however, are the three ballads.....with his rich voice adding the right touch to DO I HAVE TO CRY FOR YOU, HEART WITHOUT A HOME, and WHO NEEDS THE WORLD. But, that does not mean he does not know how to rock out also on the track MISS AMERICA and others. For all the people who want to dismiss him should take an honest and open minded listen to this cd....it is very well done! I look forward to his next! Plus, a bonus dvd is a nice treat! Regardless of what music you normally listen to, give this a try!"
5,Album that rox the world,Now or Never is the first solo Album of Nick Carter and it rox the world.The songs are soooo great with so much emotions and deeper meanings.buy it and you will see what i mean.
2,I expected alot more...,"I REALLY wanted to like this CD...but I don't. I bought it for ""Help Me"" and the rest of the songs on it aren't at all like it. I agree that some of them sound like his little brother's. Nick was cute when he was younger before the weight gain, etc.But I love ""Help Me""..."
5,"Now, not Never","All I can say is WOW!! Nick Carter has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that there's more lurking under the surface of this baby-faced blond than any of us could have possibly imagined. Who would have thought that the shy, and obviously underestimated, heartthrob of the biggest selling-pop group of our time would be able to produce such a well-crafted harmonious masterpiece? From the heart-felt lullaby of ""Do I Have to Cry for You?"" to the all-out rockin' n' rollin' of ""Girls In the USA,"" Carter has definately pulled out all the stops and inundated us with pure musical genious."
3,The only place to be is home,"This book was helpful in some aspects. It gave someadvice on how to transition to being a stay at home mom. In addition, it gave scriptural references which for me were uplifing and encouraging. However, the authors repeatedly made me feel as though it was totally ""ungodly"" if you work outside the home to make ends meet. That, for me, was the only negative aspect."
3,Very informative,Love the book. Only issue I had was I thought I was buying a new book....Came with a $1 sticker on it and it was obviously not new. Next time I'll pay better attention.
5,sweetest cd ever,"I used to dislike most 3rd wave stled ska, but then I heard the first track on this album. i instantly crapped my pants...and by the end of the song, I was convinced that this cd, Everything Goes Numb was the sweetest record ever made. The next day I bought the Cd, and listened to it a least 5 times in a row. I seriously suggest that you buy this cd right NOW. IT is just that awesome.And, for then, for a change of pace, buy any Cd by The Slackers on Hellcat records. They are Gods."
3,"overhyped, but still good.","I bought this CD about a year ago and i saw them live in LA for the first time a week ago. Streetlight Manifesto is an evolved form Catch 22 during the Keasby Nights era. Kalnoky still plays very fast guitar that doesnt exactly take on the ska beat most of the time whole the horns play lines that are reminiscent of an old fashioned wind band, (additions of Tuba and Clarinet also add on to this effect). There is nothing really revolutionary from this album, just a breath of new life into the ska scene. If you are into fast ska-punk, this should float your boat."
3,Most musically talented ska band ever formed,"This cd totally blew me away. It has slamming fast horn lines and manages to mix things up in all thier songs. I'm in band so I noticed things like split parts and insturments switching parts. They used creciandos and so many other cool things. Saddest song, Heres to Life, Everything went numb and A Better Place a Better Time are the highlights of the album. You are probally wondering at this point why I gave it three stars instead of five. Lots of people don't get it but musisicians don't need to curse. It doesnt add to the musical quality or over all effectiveness of the album. How many people but an album because it curses? In fact there are more people offended by it then impressed by it. I ended up deleting half the album from my computer. But other than that it blew me away. Incredible band."
3,A Short-Term Fix for the Truck-Obsessed Toddler,"This is a straightforward educational board book presenting different types of trucks and their activities, rendered in chunky concept-drawings, with minimal text. Most little boys go through a stage of being fascinated with trucks, and this was one of the first books I have used to introduce the different functions and shapes that trucks can take. Kids will outgrow it quickly, though, since it lacks detail for them to grow into; if you can only get one book about vehicles, get Richard Scarry's Cars and Trucks and Things that Go. But if you're looking for a fresh temporary read for your truck-fascinated toddler, do pick this up at the library."
4,I could really relate!,"I wish I could give a 4 1/2 star rating for this book. It was nearly perfect. As a young woman in my early twenties, I could really relate to the main character, Ellen, who is in her late teens. It is a story of a girl going away from home for the first time(to college) and how it causes her to change the way she looks at things in her life (mostly her parents and her home). All the little twists and turns of her life keep you turning those pages. I really enjoyed this book and was sorry to see it end. I definitely recommend it!"
5,Excellent book for intermediate/advanced users,"I enjoyed the book tremendously. It covers a huge number of topics which are enormously helpful to someone who has not programmed in linux/unix before or to even someone who has. I am somewhat disapointed that they used C instead of C++, but then C is the ""language of unix""."
4,GREAT BOOK!,"Verry nice book,from bash/sh scripting to C socket codingto CGI scripting, verry nice all in one,some parts could be a little more explained, and some are to basic,but a great buy, a MUST HAVE!!"
1,Jos. A. Banks customer service is terrible.,"If they say that your order is being processed, it may in fact be out of stock, as I found out the hard way. The are not truthful and may not respond, as the other reviewer and I both found out."
2,wrong part,"This part is listed as 30B for the Braun shaver but it is not 30B. The part I received was for a smaller model of shaver. It does not fit the Braun series 340.As for Goodman's, they did a good job. They refunded my money when I returned the part I received. Note the listing on Amazon does say 30B but that was not what I received."
5,Works great,The new heads for my razor worked great. It fit perfect and makes the razor like brand new again.
3,It is OK,"The product as received was in desired new condition and works well. The irritating factors in making the purchase were/are ...1)the difficulty in securing this particular model of shaver head in the first place, as the Braun company keeps issuing model after model, and retailers who do actually sell shaver heads have not been stocking parts for the equipment four generations back. I am grateful for the connection with the online retailer through Amazon, and the shipping was accomplished expeditiously.2) I ordered from and received the merchandise at a temporary residence in Alaska -- and the ""low-cost/no cost shipping offers disappear when the buyer is not in the ""Lower 48."" I would prefer that the full set of limitations on ""free shipping"" offers be more visible, preferably on the first screen on which the offer is presented."
3,Not quite enough,"My requirements: Apache+SSL+PHPThis book does cover some fundamental concepts but provides too few examples (especially in the areas of installation and getting SSL up and running). I had to refer to the website more often than the book.Good, but not good enough."
1,Wait 'Till It Comes Out In Cliff's Notes,"I can't make up my mind whether this book was written in the tradition of Pynchon and Barth to be taught in college English classes rather than read, or whether it's a Martin Amis-style wink-and-a prayer pot boiler with pretensions. The idea of having the narrator be a thousands-of-years-old bowl who comments on the action by relating stories of previous owners is rich in narrative possibility, which Fischer eschews in favor of semi-clever word play. The near total reliance on scenes of sexual activity and drug use to advance the narrative is a major fault. A better writer might have been able to pull it off but Fischer never gets beyond the banality of hipness."
3,Potboiler,"Like a Pot Noodle, it'll do in a pinch. I hope Tibor picks up the game next time around.Frugal.What's a Lugal, Dougal?"
2,Ross not so hot,"As with most later Ross LPs its really hard to find one complete. However for hardcore fans like myself when you miss an entire LP then you miss one or two gems that you would have missed if youhad not purchaed that album!! On this set the second track--""Love will make it right"" is a song not to be missed!!! Upfront should have been a hit but it is hidden in this flop album. So it is worth a listen for the few hits."
5,"""A Must For SERIOUS Athletes""","Although I rarley compete in races of any sort, the SERIOUS system enabled me to architect graphs and charts to acknowledge my strengths and liabilities in my fitness plan. The SERIOUS acronym also clarified my elemenatry misconceptions of Speed, Endurance, Race/Pace, Intensity, Overdistance, Up/Verticle, and Strength. Implementing a training log was also beneficial for stratifying new plans, goals, and highlighting accomplishments. If your a genuine competitor who seeks the extra winning edge, I highly reccomend that you incorporate the SERIOUS system into your training arsenal.-AllotofVision-Marshall University, Huntington, W.Va"
2,Not nearly as good as the aftershave,"I bought this accidentally thinking it was the aftershave which I really like. In small amounts it works a little like the aftershave, but I wouldn't recommend shaving with it."
1,Let Down,"This appeared to be a paperback, but what I got was a 27-page pamphlet that I could have gotten for free from any Alanon meeting. I feel fully cheated that I did not get the product as described and that I paid $3.99 for shipping for something that would have cost less than 2 stamps to ship!"
2,Disappointed,"What I received was not what I ordered. It was not ""red"" and not a paperback book...it was a booklet. If I had known this I would not have paid $3.25 + shipping for a booklet."
5,Classic Holiday Album,"Vince Gill and Olivia Newton-John perform fresh new versions of traditional Christmas carols (including two duets), exclusive to this project (the 16th of Hallmark's exclusive annual Christmas albums). Songs include: Home for the Holidays (duet); Sleigh Ride (Vince); Silver Bells (Olivia); Deck the Halls (the Bradford Singers); The First Noel (Vince); Ave Maria (Olivia); It Came Upon a Midnight Clear (Vince); Away in a Manger (duet); O Little Town of Bethlehem (Bradford Singers); What Child is This? (Olivia); Silent Night (Vince); O Holy Night (Olivia)"
3,Not my favorite,"I bought this CD because I love Vince Gill and his past Christmas CD's, but Olivia Newton John's voice (I loved her in Grease!) doesn't mesh with Vince's in the CD. I don't know, if I could take the songs that he sings alone on here, I'd like it ;-) No offense Olivia, I just don't like the combo :-("
5,A Glorious Performance!,"I've always loved Mahler's music, but I must admit that the third was not one of my favorites....until I got this DVD. The performance is just superb! Abbado is one of the truly great interpreters of Mahler and this DVD is a wonderful example. The orchestra, soloist and choruses are outstanding along with the sound and video on the Blu-Ray disc. I found it truly moving.Folks, when you finally ""get it"", Mahler's music attains a spiritual quality that I have found no composer can match. The music can touch your soul, as this performance does. This now has become my favorite Mahler DVD and one of my favorite symphonies."
2,Core Product - Jeanie Rub Var Speed,"I have had this unit for two years and have had some mixed results. My first unit lasted 6 months, burned up with a pop and smoke. After returning this unit my next unit is working but I have to be careful to not run it too long. After about 4 to 5 min. it starts to heat up. I Purchased it to be a heavy duty unit at $220.00 sorry to say it is not."
4,nicely animated and good story!,I saw this movie a while ago and I liked it then. I am as a hobby a 3d modeler/animater so I love anything done in 3d/cgi. the story was nice too.
4,Great Work,"Being a 3D modeler and animator myself I hold great respect for the effort they placed in this movie. The use of softbody, texturing and possibly fluid effects are fabulous. Some of the facial rigging (expressions) on Kaena could have been a little better though. It looked more like stop animation in a lot of instances. And I do appreciate the eye candy as well. They modeled kaena even better than the girl in Tripping the Rift.Lastly I must say that more thought could have been placed in the storyline. Because I am biased to 3D artist and respect there effort you still can't escape a good story. If this was anything other than 3D I would give it less rating. Hopefully there next project will have a better storyline."
3,good but has 2 negatives...,"Can't beat the price and it has a REALLY large screen. Two negatives, the screen does not light up when a call comes in, and the LOUD beep every time you push a button can not be silenced or lowered, very annoying. Other than that, it works fine."
1,Forget it.,"How can you take this compelling and thrilling setting and subject matter and make it tedious and stupid? I don't know, but this guy has done it. Save your money. Buy John Burdett."
2,Not worth the money,"I own a strategy guide for every Final Fantasy game, and this one was sorely disappointing. I think the only guide that has been worse than this is the FF9 'PlayOnline' joke (that no longer exists online).The strategy guide leaves out several key elements of the game (such as how to find Aeris' limit break BEFORE disc 2), how you can reach certain areas, where to find items, who to have in your party in certain areas, etc. The information was blatantly inaccurate or extremely confusing. Some of the maps are mislabeled and look more like a random assortment of screenshots than a coherent guide.All in all, don't waste your money on this guide. You're better off buying the Brady version instead."
2,NO NO NO NO!,"This game is too EASY to need this. By using Any ""CHEAT BOOK"" you ruin the game. This book is for AFTER you complete the game, if you wish to go back and get some secrets that you may have missed. Yes, it tells you, step-by-step how to complete the game, but if you do that, then the game is unneeded."
2,Product damage,"The service was great I recieved my package within a week, but when i opened it i noticed that the book was damaged due to the poor handling. I guess if your looking to just have the guide for reference then you won't have a problem but if you want it for keeps then you might want to order it with some bigger stuff so it doesn't get damaged on the way."
4,Decent...seen better,"As hintbooks go, this one is alright...much better than some of the later FF official hintbooks."
4,This one isn't the best of the FF7 strategy guides,"This guide practically gives away every plot twist in the game.You might as well just get the guide and read about it.However, this guide did help me when I needed it the most"
2,Not as good as the first printing.,"I bought the original FFVII strategy guide when FFVII first came out and there were only a minor number of problems such as incorrect stats for monsters(Aps had 0 for all of his stats) and so forth. Anyhow the guide has since been destroyed so I went and got this guide which is no where near as useful as the first printing. Such as bosses stats not being displayed in the walkthrough and even more incorrect stats(for example on pg.202 Helletic Hojo's Arms have ""Midgar"" written in where their HP should be!). I would still get this guide but I would also read several of the online guides so that you won't miss all of the great items like ribbon."
1,"FYI, ""equine oil"" = horse fat","i have bought this exact product (through a different vendor) but wanted to send it back after reading the ingredient label that came on the actual tube, which alerted me to the fact that it was made with horse fat. i didn't want any animal products in my moisturizer, especially an ingredient that requires the animal be dead. yes, equine = related to horses, but it could mean it's *for* horses (like mane n tail shampoo and conditioner products that were created for horses but are now sold for human use, too) not necessarily *from* horses. baby oil isn't from babies... so i think the product could be more upfront in its labeling, because most english-speakers won't be expecting animal fat in their lotion (perhaps magoroku = horse fat in japanese, i don't know). if you're ok with this ingredient, this may be a product that you are very happy with. i just think everyone should know what they're buying before they buy it (my vendor did NOT allow me to return it)."
1,Too Low For Zero!,"Only 20 songs. Bummer. There is a different great double CD listed here at Amazon.com called, ""Brilliant From Birth"" that contains 63 digitally remastered songs and great liner notes. Sure it is nearly three times the price, but you get what you pay for. Happy listening!"
2,Starts out well....,"This offering started out really well and it played seamlessly in the background while I worked...until...track four. While track four sounds good on the MP3 preview, it quickly builds to a literal war between someone banging chords on the piano while someone else abuses a violin. Not only did this pull me out of the state of deep concentration I was in but it gave me such a headache that it sent me RUNNING to shut off the stereo. Unfortunately each of these tracks are 15 minutes long so this is no small annoyance.I think Thompson excels in creating more ambient recordings like Gamma meditations 1 and 2. If you don't have them try them first."
2,So so....,"I am returning mine, no problem with the seller but not thrilled with the prouct. It is not as pulsating on the back as I hoped, more of just vibration. I was looking for something that would work better on deep tissue rather than surface vibration."
4,A must have,If you have ice accumulated on your walk or driveway then you need this tool. Basic shovels will not remove ice but this tool does....with ease. This tool is strong enough to handle the biggest job. Buy with confidence.
4,Why not DVD?,"Classic Blake Edwards, people who worry about everything but money. I love watching the wealthy struggling through the mid-life. Put this thing on DVD somebody."
4,Skin Deep,"My mother was looking everywhere for this movie, mainly because of the funny glow in the dark condom scene. This film is great, and John Ritter was funny (rest in peace John) I recommend this dvd to anyone who remembers John's comedy, or who enjoys a good laugh."
4,Ham on Rye,A thoroughly enjoyable rough-edged early American autobiography which blurs reality with fiction of what soon became a fashionable antihero -
1,"Not even close to a ""good read"".","I read it all, hoping to find a paragraph or two worth reading. No luck. The dialogue, and the attitudes of the characters, certainly were not representative of the era.( BTW I was reared during the Depression and responded to the call for Service).A bio? I suggest there is much fiction here , especially in the college episodes and the dialogue. On second thought, an overwhelming amount of fiction, written for shock value, in which it failed.In fairness, I have not read the author`s other works. I may, but I am not in a great hurry to do so.They may be worthwhile."
3,25 cents all the way,"This is the second of four books I bought at a library sale for a total cost of about $1.10. It's not the best of the batch so far, but I enjoyed it. It's about this lonely kid with horrible acne who spends most of his time hiding in his room. It's interesting, though almost nothing happens, and funny as hell in parts. Overall, I thought it was a good read, but I still don't see why so many people call Bukowski a ""poet."" His prose is very straightforward and honest and he isn't ashamed of his most embarrassing qualities (there are quite of few of them!) but he's no Nathaniel West or Steinbeck. I debated giving this four stars but overall it's not a great book just a good one about southern California."
5,Uttlery Fantastic,"I won't bore you with a full detailed explaination of the book or gush for line upon line about how great it is. This book nor the author don't need it. I will just simply say he is absolutly fantastic, a sheer joy to read!! Everyone should try him once.. I say once because the first time will be all that it takes to make you a fan!!"
3,"MPEG4, USB, Memory Stick Scam","I purchased this camera for ~$400 and primarily because I thought that it has USB port, memory stick and MPEG4 movie recording capability, but these capabilities are severely limited. You can only record 10-20 sec on the memory stick because it can take max 32 MB. If you use higher mem then it gives format error. The USB, MPEG4 interfaces are limited to recordings that you store on the Memory stick, so not much of a use of these features. The IEEE 1394 port is also 4 pin and would not work with 6 pin, so you got to be careful there.Other than that, for recording it has a pretty ok capabilities. I would say it's an ok camera. Maybe I am disappointed that I can't use it with my PC as I hoped to."
4,nothing much happens at the end (?),"I loved the colour of this novel, the brilliant use of imagery and the way Nabokov develops his character (Martin) so that my appreciation of and sympathy for him grew despite my initial inclinations.The edition that I read was the Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics edition, with its blurb that largely quotes Nabokov himself. And in his own words he says 'In general Glory is my happiest thing. ................. although nothing much happens at the very end ...........' If this is in any way off putting (novels are supposed to be about tension and resolution after all) I recommend you ignore it. For me, despite what the author says, EVERYTHING happens at the end."
1,Just awful.,Egad. This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. Incredibly sophomoric and predictable torture-porn.This book has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.The only good thing I can say about it is that at least I only paid $1 for it at a used book store.
3,Not a learning book,"I don't know much at all about Crystal reports, and since I've bought this book, I am still in that category. This is not a book where you learn how Crystal reports works, it mainly for integrating the reports that have been created into a .NET application, either web or windows.I wish it had more basic crystal functionality."
2,"Skip steps in examples, difficult to follow","The examples in book are difficult to follow. Many intermediate steps were skipped. I am frustrated, trying to follow examples in the book and do not get the results shown on screenshots. I end up searching Google for answers, which I found all of them. If you plan to pay for this book, my recommendation is getting a copy of table of contents and then searching in Google for the contents. The book should mention (or at least refer to) the setup that makes Crystal Reports .NET work, e.g. where & how to set up IIS, virtual directory, etc. E.g., I can't get the screenshot shown in Figure 5-4 because I do not have the required virtual directory setup. Or, I can't get the screenshot in Figure 10-4 (still looking for answer as of writing)."
2,This is by no means a reference book!,"This book glosses over many of the critical details to get your reports running smoothly in .NET. It is a very, very basic tutorial...and that's it."
3,"Good Laughs, Bad Writing","If you couple an inability to write dialog, a conspiracy theorist pandering to his acolytes, and a diatribe apparently describing a planet far removed from earth you wind up with Tim Layhaye. I laughed out loud during the first three chapters, not so much because of the material, but because of the conviction Lahaye must have of these apparent inevitabilities. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this from the perspective of light entertainment. Unlike Tim who, according to his beliefs in music lyrics, believes that whatever someone encounters (reads, hears) will ultimately become part of their philosophy - I fully read his work, and disagree with his hardline stance. If you enjoyed the unibomber manifesto, this is certainly for you. If you have a good sense of humor, this is for you. If you are easily lead to drink cool aid - I suggest you stay away from this work and get a King James."
2,"""Fighting the fine fight of the faith"", at least in LaHaye's view","LaHaye is a fundamentalist, and his beliefs seep through every page of this nonfiction book. He does make valid points about secular humanism (I was surprised to learn that it holds the same tax exempt status as do mainline Christian churches) and moral relativism in American culture. However, his valid points drown in a sea of seemingly mindless Christian rhetoric.Mr. LaHaye, take note of how Jesus Christ preached to the masses. He did not make cheap emotional appeals or call for his followers to take political action. He used simple logic and reasoning when teaching his followers. You could do the same."
2,Maracus,I ordered 2 sets of these for my Grandchildren. One came in with the handle broke not very safe as the beads come out ofthe handle. This products is more for looks and not a toy!
2,analog book,"This product did not completely meet my expectations due to the fact that I was expecting a hard copy, but I guess it was my fault for not reading if its written somewhere that it is a soft copy. The soft copy came apart very easily and does, so I would not recommend it unless your a fan of soft copy textbooks."
5,Heart warming,I recently found out this sequel to Cannery Row existed. Very cute and light hearted. I actually enjoyed this more than Cannery Row and the audiobook version is fantastic.
3,Ponderous,All those who gave this book five star reviews must be caffeine addicts.Reading it becomes a chore.Should have been edited down to half the length.Surviving the siege at Dien Bien Phu would have been easier than getting to the end of this book.
3,Not easy to read,"Very technical and scholarly. You need a lot of concentration and a quiet place to read this book. I found myself falling asleep to try to grasp what the writers were saying. Not for every day reading. Actually since there were so many points of views on the rapture and counter points of view, it made the subject quite confussing. Personally I think we will be raptured before tribulation comes, for how else can pure evil be unleashed if the church is still here with the Holy Spirit to stop evil, since we all carry Christ in us."
5,Great Album,This is a superb new album from a very talented band making their debut release on the Tone-Cool label. U Ready Man? takes the listener on an enjoyable journey that includes soulful melodies and rockin grooves. The entire album is a pleasure to listen to. If you have the opportunity to catch the band in concert don't miss out - their live shows are electrifying as every member of the band brings a wealth of talent and energy to the songs. All previous albums from Hobex are excellent listening material as well.
5,Tremendo Concierto...,"Hi this CD is a concert CD and you will hear the crowd in the background, what do you expect from a live concert, It's a compilation of old songs and a few new, with a live band not with a DJ , this reggaethon is not your typical bad word spanish reggae, Don Omar and Hector y TIto are trying to get away from that, but they still do on some concert around P.R.. He also sings salsa and and improvise in some of his songs. Remember reggathon is a variety of music mix including beats from hip hop, reggae, etc... it doesnt have to be the BOOM BASE! explosive sound coming from your speakers all the time...Get the DVD if you can...its great..RafyVilla Fontana, Carolina P.R."
2,The info in this book needs work,"This book is somewhat ok , but some of the info is wrong. Years and makes of some of the vehicles are incorrect. If you're going to write a book,get your facts straight."
1,projection clock review,"The clock works. The projection feature stopped working within days. I returned the clock for a replacement. The projection unit failed on the replacement as well, again within days. I recommend against buying this product. The clock part does work, however."
2,No replacement element,This unit worked well and threw off a fair bit of heat for a couple of years of light use. The oscillation feature works well but the unit also produces quite a bit of orange light which might be distracting depending on what you're doing in the room. The biggest downside to this product is that there is no replacement heater element which I just found out when the unit stopped producing heat and I called customer service. It seems a waste to manufacture something like this where such a basic part can't be replaced to extend the life of the unit.
4,POOR KAREN!,"THE ACTRESS WHO PLAYS KAREN DID AN EXCELLENT JOB WITH HER PART!SHE'S WORTH WATCHING IT.NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT FOR THE TITLE "" GRIM REAPER. "" A FEW KILLINGS WERE DONE BY HIS CURVED KNIFE.A COUPLE WERE DONE BY HIS SPECIAL POWER.AS SOON AS KAREN WAS HIT-SHE WAS AT A WEIRD HOSPITAL.SHE HAD ALOT OF FLASHBACKS-THINGS THAT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE REAL,BUT REALLY WEREN'T.SHE EVEN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS REAL AND WHAT WASN'T.THE HOSPITAL THAT SHE WAS IN,WAS FOR PEOPLE WHOI ESCAPED DEATH.THEY WERE TRAPPED THERE BECAUSE GRIM REAPER WANTED THEM.THE ONLY WAY THAT THE PEOPLE COULD STAY ALIVE,WAS TO REALLY DIE,AND FACE GRIM REAPER.THEY HAD TO FACE HIM,AND SOMEHOW KILL HIM.KAREN WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNEW THIS.THE MOVIE'S OKAY-BUT THE ACTRESS/KAREN REALLY MADE THE MOVIE.IF SHE WASN'T IN IT-THIS MOVIE WOULD BE TERRIBLE.SHE'S WORTH THE 4 STARS I GAVE HER."
1,Defective,"Arrived in original box, sealed. Product does not work. I tried two different sets of batteries that worked in other appliances. Scissors would not work."
1,too rough on nails,This product is not too smooth and it scratches the nails when you use it.I hated this product and never will buy it.
1,"Save your money, buy Robert Bader's book instead","This book is like Richard Anobile's books but without the pictures. Not much effort/research went into the compilation of Groucho's writing and excerpts from films. Little, if anything, is new or hasn't been republished in the last 25 years. Much better is Robert Bader's compilation of Groucho's writing: Groucho Marx and Other Short Stories and Tall Tales"
1,Duplicate,"This gift was a duplicate, and therefor a total waste of money. I don't know if returns are possible, and I can't seem to find any information about them. Definitely something to keep in mind when shopping Amazon.com"
3,Whats in a name,"When is a kit not a kit ... I purchased a 21N Conversion Cam Kit and only received a set of Cams ... the remainder of the kit just cost me $600US ... so when is a kit not a kit .... perhaps to be fair on your customers you might call this ""Kit"" a pare of Cams as part of the full conversion kit... Gary"
2,AMBIENT METAL DRONE,"It's definitely an acquired taste. Good soundtrack for a haunted house, as another reviewer has pointed out. I would imagine a more psychotic Black Sabbath played at half-speed would end up sounding much like Sunn0))). Slow, droning, plodding is fine. But explore the themes/ideas/feelings more fully. The first track is the most interesting, because it doesn't have a chance to get boring. If you're going to create a dark soundscape, don't sketch the same idea over and over again, but explore some new ones, or develop the theme or certain elements more fully....Sunn0))) has great potential, but hasn't met it yet..."
3,lacking originality,"This is of the same ilk as Earth, but with an oppressive Black metal current as opposed to the stoner rock vibe -An ""evil"" spin on Earth's ambient drones"
5,None More Black,"IN a very Spinal Tap way, the fine line between clever and, well, you know, has been trod upon by grimy boots. I can't help feeling jealous when I listen to this one: this is the album I wish I could have done but dammit I'm not that erudite to grapple with the obvious and keep things minimal. ALl of Sunn 0)))'s work is pretty much the same, but all pretty much goddam genius in its deconstruction, decomposition, dissection wtih rusty instruments of what we expect music to be. THis is sound, soundscape, the texture of tone and the blackness of the sound. This album is the musical equivalent of chewing coffee grounds after lines of Prozac and trying to make poetic sense out of Freud Nietzsche and the Surrealists. If you listen to this long enough, you will empty out all conscious thought and be fresh to fill your head again with all sorts of random crap, and then listen again and clean it all out. Rinse and repeat. Reverberate.Not for the timid or the easily bored."
3,Lost in bleak black,"Ambient drone doesn't get much darker, so we are obviously dealing with a fairly acquired taste. Contrary to some restlessness that does occur from some frail repetition, the overall experience behind an entire album's relentlessly bleak, though strangely soothing tone is rarely undermined."
4,For those of us who have been living in a cave,"Sun O))) gives this world of weak humans something beautiful; most of us will never properly grasp such beauty. Unless you're familiar with the sort of elitist soundscapes created by outfits like Lustmord and Pan Sonic, you won't understand the amazing things some of these ""metal"" guys are capable of doing. You'll just have to take a leap and liten. Black One takes all the accepted cliches and throws them out of the window. Cookie-monster vocals are the only cue as to where these guys come from, aside from that it's a long, long way off from your burnout older brother's Venom LPs. The fellows in Sunn O))) own and operate Southern Lord, which is host to many other talented and original bands, most of which I'm planning to check out, as I am new to this particular renaissance.Great makeout tunes for the kind of evening that ends in tragedy."
3,Not his best,"I have always been excited about Carpenter's work ever since I was a kid watching The Thing for the first time. Pro - Life seems to have missed the mark a bit. There are a few moments where you can have fun with his stlye - one example - using the long lens to introduce the very creepy van. Other than that, it is fun to hear his son's excellent score (which sounds alot like Carpenter himself - which Robert Rodrigez used this exact scoring style in Planet Terror!) which is perfect for the film. I wish Carpenter would go back into feature film before he is done. Short forms are fun (Cigarette Burns was very good) but, feature films are where we see him shine!"
1,Lame lampoon of a serious issue,"This is an incredibly lame and absurd pro-abortion screed. There is no other ideological group as thoroughly slurred and misrepresented by Hollywood as pro-lifers. There are tens of millions whose commitment to the sacredness of all human life extends to (but doesn't remotely stop at) the pre-born. The media consistently choose to identify them with a small handful of violent, isolated sociopaths with no connection to the mainstream pro-life movement. I know on a certain level that a program in which the doting dad is Satan isn't exactly meant to be taken entirely seriously, but that makes the distortions all the more insidious and difficult to address. Can you imagine the series portraying, say, feminists, environmental activists, Jews or Moslems in the same sickly distorted light? For that matter, can you imagine them being told afterward to lighten up because its just a horror series?"
1,Sunday Night Movie of the week,"This movie was awful, and no I'm not saying that for political reasons. This movie was just an hour, because if it were any longer there would be a rash of suicides. Don't let the John Carpenter title fool you. This movie was horrible. It was like those awful made for TV movies you'd see on Sunday Nights after football. If this really is a John Carpenter movie, someone must have found it hidden in his garage, or in the Bathroom underneath the sink and decided to release it. Don't waste your time."
2,Nice attempt...,"I was hoping that this had some good early Peter Gabriel footage since, being a Genesis fan, never saw the band with Grabriel at the helm. It does have footage of the band playing smaller studio type venues but not full songs, interlaced with documentary by people I don't care about. Who is this guy? Not the greatest sound or video either but it did satisfy my desire to some degree. Still looking for good full concert dvd."
4,A must have!,"When someone is giving me advice or directions I want it brief and direct. In other words, give me the bottom line. Ten Minutes to the Pitch, by Chris Abbott is just that kind of book. Abbott's book is directed at pitching screenplays but the advice is also applicable to pitching a story for a publisher.Abbott provides a checklist consisting of fifteen concise steps to successfully pitching story ideas and the sound reasoning behind the steps. Scattered throughout the book are brief stories that are occasionally humorous and support the checklist. Also included is a section titled: Know the Industry, helpful publications and reference lists.Armchair Interviews says: This is a small, handy must have reference book. If you write and want to sell what you write, you would serve yourself well to buy this book, place it on your reference shelf (the one that you don't loan out because anyone who wants it should have their own) and read it again."
5,Shooting Reconstruction,"A great book - a must for anyone in the field of Forensic Ballistics or students studying a forensic based degree. There are several well-worn copies of this book at the section in which I work. This has proved to be an invaluable reference during my initial training and subsequent case work. Many of the techniques detailed have been utilised to great affect at a shooting scene and back in the lab, especially range determination and the use of chemicals (e.g. DTO, Griess Test etc.) The explanations and general overview of the chemistry in this particular section is very useful. I have also found the chapters on bullet penetration/perforation and deflection/ricochet against various targets extremely useful and something that I regularly revisit."
3,This can help you.,If you're going through some challenging times in your life this book can help you see the power of God and how He can work in your circumstances.
5,When I Lay My Isaac Down,"Fantastic book, very encouraging for any mother going through a fiery trial with their adult child or children. Hope that even in the darkest hour, God is there. Highly recommended."
3,Revealing story,"This is a good story of a family struggle. Could be any of us, but for the same reasons, personal growth. The growth of the individual players in this drama are compelled to come to grips with their foundational beliefs and to then use that growth in their daily lives. Well written, but was read poorly on the CD. It needs work to muster through, but it was good."
2,Didn't care for it,"I have to agree with some of the other readers that this book was very disappointing. I also knew that the book would have a religious tone, but I had no idea it would consume most of the book. I really wanted to read about this famiy's plight but there was only an occasional paragraph of the situation sprinkled in between the pages and pages of scripture and preaching and endless self questioning. To be honest, I started the book and became quite impatient and skipped page after page after page trying to get to the actual story and found it somewhere toward the end. I never did read the entire book, I couldn't wade through it. But being a mother and having a not so perfect son myself, but not to the degree of murder, I do understand some of the feelings she has encountered. My heart goes out to her and the victim's family."
4,Very informative on a personal level.,"I very much enjoyed this book.They say history is written by the winners and the women of the old west were truly winners.They fought hardships we can never imagine and most never lost hope.These are their stories,in their own words,which to me,gives it more meaning.Nothing was really edited and it is marked as such.We can see the hope,dispair,and fulfilment of these women as they braved a new land.They trod beside their husbands and children and thru it all reamined the glue that held them together.I has helped me understand more and learn more about the fierce American woman!"
3,Arrived broken,"I though it would be smaller...my mistake. Good price though, for something this size. However, my product arrive with one of the top corners broken, and the plastic was missing. I checked the packaging for the piece, thinking it had broken off in transit, and that I would just super-glue it back on, but I could not find it. Company sent me a broken product."
2,More war than hospital,"I bought this book because the blurb talked about ""moral quandries of practicing medicine in a war zone"". I wanted to explore how physicians and hospitals make decisions and provide treatment/care during war. Instead, much of the book focuses on Bosnian history and the recent war. While the book was interesting and well-written, it was not exactly what I sought."
2,"""Ahora si"" is disappointing","Disappointing""Ahora si"" is disappointing, the production values of the recording are very limited andthe record sounds like another desperate intent to do something with Cachao. The onlygood thing still Cachao's bass and fire to play his music, the rest is very average. I collectCachao's records and for sure, this is one won't get lots of play time."
1,"If you care about music, do not buy this puzzle!","I usually read the reviews before making a purchase and I cannot express how much I wish I had done so this time. I have been very pleased with other M&D toys and was excited to find the musical sound puzzle. The physical puzzle is fine but, as other reviewers have stated, the sound is flat-out terrible. With the exception of the drums and xylophone, all of the instruments sound the same. And all of the instruments, including drums and xylophone, are cheap synthesized tones. My child can learn more about the different instruments through my amateur impressions of them than through this puzzle. If it can't be returned, it's going to quietly and quickly disappear."
2,Expected more from Melissa & Doug,"I had expected each instrument piece to sound like the instrument they showed, but many sound exactly the same. The magnetic piece that causes the sound to start is not always well placed but is rather off so it won't always make sound when it should. Every piece plays a few notes of ""Old McDonald,"" and even after just a few days, I'm sick of it. The melody must finish before a new one can start, so if my older son is too fast with placing piece number two, it won't play for him. I really had expected more from this well-known brand, and I'm very disappointed."
1,As a stand alone puzzle it's great; as a musical instrument puzzle it's time to go back to the drawing board!,Length:: 3:28 MinsBecause this is an audio product I decided to do a video review. It's my first one so please bear with me. The sound isn't as good as I would like it to be but I feel I can still be understood. This should help you decide whether or not you should purchase this item for your child.
3,Didn't work quite as expected,Overall it is a good toy. It just doesn't seem to work like it should. It doesn't always work when you put the pegs down and then goes off when no one is playing with it. All the sounds are too similar. I Would have preferred more differentiation between instruments.
4,"Slow to start, but then some good material","Experienced programmers will find the first few chapters a bit slow, it seems to be aimed at people fairly new to any sort of programming. The pace picks up later in the book, with good sections on connecting to a MySQL database, using XML, generating graphics on the fly etc. The book concludes with a complete sample application using a backend database.For newcomers to PHP it's a good starting place, experienced web programmers/developers could probably jump straight in with Professional PHP."
3,I was stucked at chatper 6,"I was having headache when i read the book, that because the examples were all related to MATH . it's no use for building a real website . I feel sick of their explaination with more than pages, and just one example for the whole chapter .If you hate MATH , dont buy this book ."
2,DISAPPOINTED,I purchased this based on the greatness of Baseball Mogul. I thought if it was half as engrosing it could be a good game. I would say that it is just a disappointment. There is not enough player detail. Maybe the future Football Moguls will be better.
2,Thoro-ley re-hash,"I am one of the biggest fans of George Thorogood there is. The first time I ever heard him I was hooked,way back in 79. So I guess all us hard core fans are a bit more critical. I am too dissapointed with this CD. It could have been made with a lot better song selection in mind. Too many songs repeated from other Live releases. But thats the same with George's concerts also. His set list has varied very little over the past decade. One good thing about this release though, definitley pick up the video of this CD. It fully captures a Thorogood concert experience, and makes the repetiveness of the selections bearable. Yes, Im a fan George, but time to bury ""Who Do You Love"", ""Nighttime"", ""I Drink Alone"", ""GearJammer (Ugh)"", etc. Its not really the guitar playing, or singing, (which George himself admits is not the tops), but the ATTITUDE he brings. We do love the musicianhip, but really appreciate Georges respect for ""true"" rock n'roll!"
1,Shameful and pathetic...,It's shameful and pathetic that any publisher would presume to censor Mark Twain by sanitizing Huckleberry Finn as Barron's has done. I urge anyone who loves literature to boycott this travesty of an edition.
4,Huckleberry Finn,"Set in the 1800's, Huckieberry Finn is a book about a boy's adventures trying to set a runaway slave free. Huck Finn's father is always getting drunk, locking Huck in their cabin whenever he goes out. One day Huck manages to escape and starts down the river in a canoe he found. Eventually, he meets up with Jim, a runaway slave, and they decide to go down the Mississippi River together. The book is filled with humor and adventure, like the time when Huck Finn tries to return some stolen money. In an effort not to get caught, Huck Finn hides the money in the first place he sees...a coffin! Unfortunatley, before he could retrieve the money the coffin is buried. Now, he has to find a way to unearth the money and return it to its rightful owner. All before the bandits discover what he's been up to. It's a realy good book, you should read it."
2,A Classic Only Garrison Could Love,"Huckleberry Finn, as told by Garrison Keillor, was a profound disappointment for me, a fan of all things Wobegone. As a faithful version of THE American Classic, this telling takes jarring liberities (such as changing the ending!) and leaves loose ends (Huck posing as Tom at the aunt's home is suddenly just Huck again without explanation). As a good audio narrative, forget it: Garrison's sonorous delivery doesn't make it. Very frustrating listening while driving - every word is a moan or whisper with consonants that crack and pop, so no volume is comfortable. His character voices meld together in places, making it difficult to follow the give and take between the Duke and the King. And in one spot on the river, it sounds like Guy Noir quizzing Huck! Yuck. I'd advise: pick another version, and you'll like Huck Finn and Garrison Keillor better."
3,Not my cup of tea,"I was disappointed after reading this story. Of course the message is important and Mark Twain is a talented writer, no one can deny that. However I found it difficult to read this book with the dialoge and the plot wasn't really holding my attention."
5,A young boy and his adventures to save a runaway slave,Heartwarming novel full of unexpected surprises of how a young boy changes through experience. It's one of the most important novels out there!
3,Problematic yet worthwhile,"Well, this book is worthwhile reading, but there's no question that the depiction of Jim leaves a lot to be desired. Yeah sure, Huck's best friend is a runaway slave, but what are we to make of the fact that Jim is given virtually no voice in the novel? There's something unmistakably childlike (and I don't mean that positively) about Jim; he is hardly a fully-drawn adult character. Twain's views on race are defined in part by the time in which he wrote, but then isn't that true for all of us? The last time I discussed this book in a group, it provoked such debate the person across the room threw his copy at me. Maybe that alone is reason enough to read it."
3,Review,"I completely agree with some of the reviewers postings about the fact that this book has been banned by some schools in the past and banned from communities in general, yes it can be racist but it is literary genius on Mark Twain's part by taking this touchy subject of racism and running with it. This is a story about a troubled boy who gets into all sorts of adventures, even with those of different races. Put aside race and open this book and read between the lines on what Mark Twain was actually trying to achieve. Huckleberry Finn has become a literary hero along with his friends in the story, and it is a well known book that should be read!"
3,Great Classic Read!,I had never read Huckleberry Finn and am glad that I did. I enjoyed the content as well as Twain's literary style. It was a very quick read and I'm glad I spent the time to enjoy it.
3,"What is expected from a ""Classic""","Huckleberry finn is a story about a young boy, who learns the value of life and equality among human beings. He was born to a drunk and did not go to school, although he was very good at outdoors things. After running away from his father, who was keeping him against his will, Huck meets a slave named Jim. Jim just so happened to be a slave of a woman who tried to civilize Huck. After many adventures with Jim, Huck realizes that he cares for Jim, and Jim cares for him."
4,First go round,I think this is one of those books that need to be read more than one time so I'm not writing my review until I've gone through it again. I can say that I admired the discipline in which Twain exacted in keeping with the dialects of each of the characters.
3,vanessa review,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel written for enjoyment, the adventures that Huck has are somewhat comical and enjoyable for everyone. There is also a more serious side to the novel where Twain uses Huck to learn the evils of society that the story takes place in. Through Huck, Twain tells his opinion of slavery and shares his own moral values. Because this is a realistic book, Twain can convey his thoughts and morals to readers of every level, not just highly educated scholars. Using realism, Twain lets people know how he thinks and shows that people can change. Realism is utilized to allow all people to be able to relate and understand what is going on in the novel. I believe everyone at one point in their life should read this novel."
2,Don't waste your time,I would have dropped this book after the first chapter if it wasn't required for my English class. The book just kept on going... the text was confusing and dull. Huck's character was just unbelievable in the extent of knowledge he had at what appeared to be a pre-teen age. I am failing to see how all American Literature stemmed from this great masterpiece.
1,Sent book back 2 wks. ago and still have not received a credit. Poor customer service!,"After receiving the book, I was astounded by the size. It fit in the palm of your hand. There was no description of the book size, so I called the vendor and told them I was sending it back and wanted a refund. As of today 12/21, I have not been credited back to my account. I'll never do business with that company again. When I spoke with a representative, he said I would have to pay to ship it back and I would get credited within 7 days. NEVER DID GET THE CREDIT~~~"
3,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"Let me clarify a little; this is more like...a 3.7/5. I don't want to label it as ""okay"", because I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, but I wouldn't put it up there with books like Avalon High, Gone, or Matched, since I didn't enjoy it that much.I read this for my Honors American Literature class, and we're just now finishing it up. I had never read Huck Finn all the way through before (maybe a Great Illustrated Classics version when I was much younger), but I found that I ended up really enjoying the book. Especially discussing it in class and all that, and learning more about the characters than I would have normally. The book was incredibly insightful, and I can only imagine the buzz it must have caused when it was actually published.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"
5,An American masterpiece,"""Huckleberry Finn"" reflects very accurately the thinking and culture of the time. I was shook by the part where Huck recognizes that which many adults would not for years to come: that the African American is a human being worthy of that which all humans are entitled. It is a contemporaneous account of history, albeit fictional; it is typical of many accounts of the time, told as only Twain could tell it: so vividly that you feel Huck's adventure is your own.I found this edition very well done. I do admit, however, that I spent most of the book reading ""chile"" as ""chilli"". P.S. chile = child."
1,Never happened before.....,"I have never written a bad review on amazon because it is the most reliable vendor ever. Unfortunately, this edition of Huck Finn is a total failure - the pages just fell out of the book when I was only halfway through. The cover catches your eye, but choose another publisher to enjoy this classic."
4,"It's no Tom Sawyer, but still fine work","This book, which is more of a companion to ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" than a sequel, has Twain displaying his talents on all fronts. His classic wit shines through as does his knack for expressing deep observations about life through the life and events of a child. This book lacks some of the mystique that Tom Sawyer has and the plot moves more slowly. This is still great reading, however, as Twain's effort here is better than many authors' strongest moments. If you liked Tom Sawyer, you will enjoy this book. If you're curious to try Twain, I would recommend Tom Sawyer before giving this one a try."
3,11th grade student review,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is one of thoes books where you have to stick with it through the boring parts. Huck is a horrible character and is emotionally mute, except for the occasional ""doing something good for someone else"", he has opinions, they're just not strong. Compared to Holden from Catcher in the Rye, Huck is a character who lacks substance. Huck's adventures along the Mississippi River with an escape slave Jim are very unbelievable. On these adventures Huck encounters many people that Mark Twain wants the reader to see how awful these people are, leaving Huck Finn at the end of the book not liking people. The characters are occasionally funny and thought provoking. Mark Twain uses this book to look at human nature unlike Tom Sayer which is a children's book. Mark Twain also uses alot of symbolism in the book, so half of the book is understanding and noticing the symbolism."
3,BOOK REVIEW BY: JESS,"Huckleberry Fin was a good an exciting book. It was easy to visualize what was going on when you were reading it. It was about a poor 13 year old boy named Huckleberry FIn. His father was a drunk, and would beat him so he decided to run away. Huck ran away with A former slave named Jim. They shared many adventures as they went from town to town. Huckleberry fin was a good book, and if you take the time to read it you will enjoy it."
1,the book seemed a little confusing,this book made no sense at all.i enjoy reading but i did not like this book.it had no point at all and the dialect was terrible.
4,The first 2/3s are wonderful; the last 1/3 not so much.,"Wow, this is truly a wonderful novel. I'd read it before, but it had been more than 20 years. An adventure story, it also deals (usually obliquely) with a lot of social, moral, and cultural issues, including (most obviously) issues of race. Twain's use of the ""N"" word is startling and disturbing to modern ears, but it is essential to convey the import.I remember that when I first read it, I didn't like the last few chapters very much...and I still don't. Quite unlike the first 2/3s of the book, they seem to me to be a cop-out on Twain's part. It's as though - having written a brilliant, sometimes-humorous, often-tragic commentary on life - he felt the need to dumb-it-down at the end."
4,Very interesting and exciting to read.,"This book is about a teenage boy name, Huckleberry Finn. The main theme of this story is that regular society is trying to make Huck civilized, trying to teach him the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic, and for the most part, he doesn't like that. Huck would runaway to seek freedom for himself. In his adventure to freedom, he runs into Jim, a runaway slave. They would both run into different people in different situations, which were sometimes good and sometimes bad. Both of them encountered many different adventures together. Must read if you want to know what happens at the end. Would they find freedom for themselves or would they get back at being civilized? I liked this book because it is very interesting. I couldn't stop reading it because I keep on thinking to myself what will happen to Huck in his many different adventures to freedom. I would recommend this book to others because it is very interesting to read."
4,There is a reason this book is a classic,"Highly, highly, highly politically incorrect and if you look at it on the surface alone you are likely to be offended. That is until you read into what Twain is really saying then you can see the absurdity of it all. Huck Finn lives in a time when an African-American is considered a property and not a person. The interaction between Finn and Jim is fantastic. This book is a classic because of how you'll find yourself uncomfortable reading how everyone looks at Jim. If your uncomfortable reading it then ask yourself why and maybe you'll learn something about yourself, society, and what strong a writer Mark Twain really was."
5,Jeff Watts Review,I thought the book expressed rasism and reality about the world as it was during their time. These issues were a concern to Jim and Huck but in actualality Huck never realized that Jim was being treated unfairly. This lets us learn that racism cannot go on and that it needs to change during our time. That is why the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was an outstanding novel for kids to read.
3,"Great info, but very hard to read","There is a lot of information in this document, for a good price! However, the Kindle version is very hard to read. Don't know if it was originally so packed together, but the Kindle version is, and furthermore, it's not searchable."
2,More Political Than Prophetic,"While the subject matter seems thorough and well documented, this is more a study of cults than of prophecy. The title is somewhat deceptive. If you are looking for a compendium of end-of-the-world prophecies, especially from a believer's perspective, this book is going to be a disappointment."
5,John A from Spring Lake,"Great price, product arrived on-time as expected. The part was packaged well and worked exactly as it was offered. Can't ask for more -A1. Thanks."
5,great cookbook,"This cookbook was given to me as a gift with a new toaster oven. I have tried several of the recipes (such as a pesto baked chicken, baked eggs, and a few others) and found them quite good. I'm most impressed with the focus on fresh, healthy (non-processed) ingredients, which isn't always the case in a cookbook geared towards convenience. Since this is my first toaster oven, I also appreciate the tips at the beginning of the cookbook for cooking in a small oven, including suggested times and temperatures for many common foods. It's a great resource."
4,Very helpful guide and resource for the whole family!,"I purchased this book 4 months ago and both my husband and I have used it on several occasions to gather additional information on how to treat and respond to various health questions. My husband wanted to know more about fish oil and it's affects on cholesteral so I pointed to the book. He was very happy with the information he found. I wanted to research childhood Asthma for my brother's son and I found helpful case studies on the topic. I found this book useful and informative, I especially liked reading case studies they were more helpful than reading an experts opinion. I will keep this book as both a tool and a reference in our family library for years to come."
5,Required reading for anybody with a kitchen,"Well organized, straight forward information about preparing everything from soup to nuts...literally. The instructions and photographs are detailed, yet not overly complex, and the recipes and variations allow you to refine your skills at your own pace.This book lays a perfect foundation on which to build an impressive repertoire of culinary skills."
1,99 cents and almost worth every penny.,"Found this at a thrift store and initially thought it would be a good addition to the Blessed Mother/Rosary section of my Catholic library. Sadly, not true.The author writes in an authoritative voice which at first is quite convincing, but his ""facts"", ""history"" and personal theology seem to serve a Pre-Vatican II ideology.I'll keep the book, but assign to the ""swing and a miss"" section."
2,Poorly constructed,"Looks pretty good, but material is too cheap for the price paid. Broke twice after we received it. Tossed it away."
3,"Simplicity, all in a book!","This book is excellent, although a bit hard to get into. On the whole I found it rather badly translated, which means that it doesn't flow, and just when you think you're getting into an idea and able to relate something to your life, it changes tack rapidly, mid-paragraph and is discordant. But looking past that to the spirit of the book, it has an excellent chapter on contemplation, including a section on his year's leave for contemplation. The book also addresses the church, and broadly looks at what the church really needs now (and to be sure, it needs a lot), although here his bias against himself and his fellow Americans shows through. Similarly, as a self-professed Catholic (and a Franciscan friar), he finds fault in his own religion, and is happy to speak out on this. Neither of these are bad things, and on the whole, the book is very interesting, and, if you let it, and if you read it carefully, can make quite an impact on your life."
4,More Adventures from Georgia and Angus!,"Georgia's back again, manic and self-obsessed as ever, but this time, it seems like things are actually going to work for her. She's caught the eye of Robbie (aka the Sex God), and her parents aren't forcing her to move to New Zealand after all! Then, out of the blue, Robbie dumps her because ""she's too young for him,"" and Georgia finds herself back at square one.This is a fine book, and Georgia is certainly a memorable and distinct character, though not always the most likeable one. She's not particularly the best friend she could be to Jas, whom Georgia likes to enjoy baiting more than anything. And in both this and the first book, there's some disturbing activities happening in the background with Georgia's mom and doctors/interior decorators while dear old dad's out of the country. But hey, how could Georgia concentrate on things like that when she's got to convince Robbie she's mature enough to date??! An easy to read, realistic, funny book."
4,Good sequel,"Funny and ironic, ""On the Bright Side"" was a great follow-up to ""Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging."" ""On the Bright Side"" chronicles the furthur throes and adventures of teen Georgia Nicolson, as she battles the ups and downs of school, friendships, and relationships. I found the British humor of the book refreshing and enjoyable, and was able to sympathize with several of Georgia's frustrations. While the novel's ending was not as satisfying as its predecessor's, it was still a great read. Georgia's methods of dealing with her ferocious cat, boy-crazy best friend (not that she isn't a bit boy crazy herself), and parents who just do not understand her are fun, comical, and pure teenager. A great book for laugh-out-loud reading."
5,great book,"wonderful light reading. any teen looking for a good laugh should read this book, along with the other two in the series."
3,Where is the book?????????/,"Okay, the movie was cool. Really! But I had a chapter book called Puff the Magic Dragon in the Land of Living Lies, like 4 years ago! But i don't know what happened to it, all I know is it's no longer at my house. *scowls* Does ANYONE know where I can find the book???????????????????? The internet *cough* google *cough* is telling me that theres only a movie but I KNOW there is a book!!!!! Could someone PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me out?????? PLEASE????????"
1,terrible,Ive purchased 2 of these thinking that they were a good low cost alternative to replacing the power supply. I have numerous good pc power supplies . Both of these talismoons practically caught fire they got so hot. I managed to salvage one but have to keep a fan running on the connector and my 360 frequently locks up. I will be throwing them all away and purchasing a microsoft oem power supply.
1,Doesn't seem to work with newer 360's,"When I initially got this for my 360, it worked great with thermaltake 430W powersupply. When my 360's DVD-drive broke, microsoft sent me replacement 360 that seems to have had the newer ""Falcon"" 65nm chip inside. They are supposed to use less energy and give off less heat. Thus they are less likely to get the Red Ring of Death. But it seems they dont work with this Talismoon cable and power supply. The power port on the 360 looks a bit different but it still works with older OEM power supplies but not this Talismoon Cable.Just a warning. This cable is useless to me now."
5,Packs a punch. This is a rare and complete book that reads like a text. A must have if interested in Brazil in any form.,"Only the highest mark for this outstanding work. If you're interested in Brazil, this is the book you want. Thank you Joeseph Page for this fantastic novel that could easily qualify as a sociological journal. This is without a doubt my favorite book in years."
5,A great read,This is just first class - entertaining and informative. It really does stand out among books about Brazil. Some aspects of the book are a little out of date now which is a shame. However what it still manages to do is to give you a feel for Brazilians and Brazil that is lacking in many other books. The insights feel authentic.
5,Favorite shoes!,"I have several pairs of these Chinese shoes. Some in the cotton style as well as this silk style, and I love them. They are very comfortable, and I'm on my feet a lot during the day so comfort is important. I do slip a Dr. Scholl's Gel insert in to give a little arch support. I plan to buy even more of these shoes since they come in so many different colors and patterns. I love the tapestry pattern I've seen! One can never have too many Chinese shoes!"
3,Live and Unknown,"It's definitely Muddy, but from when and where is anyone's guess. 11 cuts ranging from ""Corrina, Corrina"" to ""Mojo"", this is a pretty well recorded set, but without credits, it's hard to tell from what period of Waters' career this is taken from- I would guess the '70's, but who knows. Still, ain't nothing wrong with live Muddy Waters, no matter how you find it."
4,Choked everytime,"""Gone too soon"" has been mentioned already by one of the previous reviewers. It is Impossible NOT to cry when listening to this track on a jet plane - close(?) to heaven.I always toast people who have gone when i'm at 39000 feet.Try it and see if you don't agree.God Rest you Diana."
3,Enjoyable listening,"This CD is great and enjoyable to listen to, but the music is not what I expected."
2,neck wrap,Bought this because the old wrap works so well. The new one made in china is no way near the same quality.The contents feel a lot more coarse and not enough. Have to juggle it around to get the herbs in the middle so it does not cool off too fast. Would not recommend it to anyone.
4,excellent value,"these are an excellent buy.they're not the best construction, but compared to expensive shorts that probably come from the same Chinese sweatshop, they've done just fine by me."
4,"This is a good movie for adults,teens, and mature kids","This is a good movie for adults,teens,and mature kids. Some of the things they do are adult such as, call people bad names(real bad)or harrass people or, in one particular scene, a boy gets beaten most ferociously with a reed cane.It is a sad but good movie and it tell of real things that happened then.I enjoyed it but they talk in old english and really fast so be prepared.."
2,The Legend of Kon Tiki,"I have to admit, Kon Tiki has become something of a legend in my school. All the incoming freshmen have it as required reading, and I have yet to meet someone who passed through the school and actually enjoyed this book. It's tiring and tedious, and honestly, it's just boring, at least to the 3000 students at the local high school."
5,Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft,"The author of the book was the lead on this expedition, and wrote the book documenting actual events, but wrote so interestingly that it felt like a novel. This trip was a fantastic experiment made in 1947 that proved the authors theory about how the tropical islands of the Pacific were first populated with humans."
2,Shift!,"This CD is one of the WORST CD's out there today. Taking on the wannabe MTV trance style of making ONE hit song, then releasing a second and a third that basically copies your original style, this CD has NO redeeming factors. If you're one of those people that isnt reallyy into trance, unless its on TV or the Radio...hey, buy up. Everyone else...well, everyone else should know better."
5,A Must Read by All....,"I have to say that I do not get much reading done these days but I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN...very suspenseful, I could not wait to turn the page to see what would happen next. Sometimes I would look around the room to see if anyone else was there, this book pulls you in so much that you feel like you are there right along with the characters, they seem so real.... Sally has a gift for storytelling and I look forward to reading more of her books in the future..."
3,Milch's Unfinished Opus,"As one who thinks ""Deadwood"" was the best TV series ever produced, I had high hopes for ""John From Cincinnati"" but alas, the show was so offbeat that HBO axed it before Milch could completely unreel his preposterous concoction.While the show had some great moments and solid acting, I can't fathom why anyone would want to own this half-baked series -- but then I guess there are some who like to eat half-cooked batter with a spoon and call it a culinary delight.Milch's idiosycratic dialogue worked perfectly in the mouths of Deadwood's denizens but similar lines sounded absurd coming from his surfer dudes and assorted oddballs. This ill-fated show simply never got its feet on solid ground.If he'd had another season to bring it all together, Milch might've been able to pull it off but as it stands now, ""John From Cincinnati"" is mostly Driftwood From Milch."
5,How could HBO cancel this extraordinary series?,"I am still amazed at HBO's decision to cancel ""JFC"", and yet the exceedingly boring ""Big Love"" continues to get renewed. I wish another network (Showtime)would pick this up. The characters draw you in, and soon enough your part of this compelling journey. I have NEVER been so moved by a television series. Mr. Milch, how can you let this go?"
5,Sandisk 8GB CF Card - Exactly what I wanted,Was looking for a CF card for my husband's camera and I got exactly what I needed. Easy to use and the photos looked great when uploaded from the card.
2,not compatible with my camera; great return service,"the bad: too bad there is NO PLACE in the specs that lists compatible cameras....the card simply would not format in my older coolpix, finally had to google the information to figure out it was over the capacity of the camera. BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR CAMERA SPECS BEFORE YOU ORDER THIS CARD.the good: the return system at Amazon is seamless: get the Return Authorization online, drop it off in original packaging at UPS, see the credit on your CC statement.kind of hard to rate something i couldn't use..."
1,Ultra II now called Ultra,"I ordered and just received what was supposed to be the new Ultra II Compact Flash card. It showed Ultra in the picture. But what I received was a card called the Ultra and labeled Ultra, not Ultra II. So I just returned it and came back on the internet to order an Ultra II card. But what do I find out, SanDisk renamed the Ultra II card to Ultra and I just returned an Ultra II card. Boy, Amazon. You should fix your web page. You must be paying a lot of return postage for something that you didn't need to do."
4,Good product,As advertised it performs well. No strict comparison to offer as this is the first CF I have bought in a very long time.
5,Excellent Compact Flash Cards,"I have been using this product for some time; thus far, I have had no problems."
4,Hidden Gems from a different time,"This is a very good CD of lost gems from the Northeast. Lots of mad guitar, low production values, catchy hooks, and one KILLER in the Title track, ""Heart So Cold"" that SHOULD have been on the Top 40! If you have ""PEBBLES"" ""NUGGETS"", and ""BACK FROM THE GRAVE"" volumes, this will make a nice addition to your collection. If your 60s music collection runs to the popular, give this a try...you wont be disappointed."
2,"""Yuppie Guide""","As with the only other Sally O'Brian authored-guide that I've used (for Sydney, Australia), this guide leaves much to be desired. Concentrating on trendy hotels, restaurants and bars, this guide gives short shrift to the sights, museums and history of Copenhagen. This guide also dispenses with the section on ""Getting There"", ""Getting Around"", and such that used to make Lonely Planets the most useful guide out there. This is more like a Fodors for the pretentious than a good guide to Copenhagen.If this is the new format, I fear for the Lonely Planet series. One would be better off with a ""Let's-Go"""
4,Reliable guide to an exciting city!,"This book was extremely informative, all information is clear and concise and was easy to navigate through.We wanted an easy to use, novice guide on what to do/where to go/what to see/where & what to eat etc. for a short break in the city and this book told us everything we wanted to know & more.This helped us to plan a full itinerary for our trip prior to us arriving - and therefore, helped us to not waste a minute of our precious holiday time!Have nothing really bad to say about the publication - it is well written, interesting & informative; without being too detailed/long-winded.Would appeal greatly to music lovers - as it has a special section devoted to the famous Jazz Festival."
4,nice way to learn Korean,"I purchased this iLingo AsiaPack for my husband who wants to learn Korean. As a native Korean speaker, I think this pack has a talking voice sounded like reading a book, and there are a few phrases that are very old or no one really use any more (just like a lot of language learning books). But, for my husband, who loves his ipod, I think it works quite great. He listens to his ipod a lot, so he catches some words by listening or reading. So, overall this is OK way to learn Korean. I am not so sure about other languages in this pack. We haven't try yet."
5,Trance at its best,"Thee-o is a renound dj for his ability to hipnotize the crowd into a danceing machine, as it was at ""All Tranced Out"" and at the infamous ""How Sweat It Is""(was). this cd is shure to please the buyer!"
2,Quiet is a relative term,"I purchased the Whisper 100 about three weeks ago to drive both tubes on an undergravel filter in a 30 gal tank. I was replacing a Whisper 40 that wasn't able to drive two tubes. The 100 was noticeably louder than the 40, but still OK in my living room. You could tell it was there, but you could tune it out. Until a couple of days ago. The whisper turned into a rattling hum on the left side. Adjusting the airflow made no difference. I had to disconnect the tube. That did the trick, until today when the right side started going south. So I unplugged it and now have two separate pumps (a whisper 40 and some other tiny one I got at Walmart) running the two tubes. Both of them together are quieter than the 100 was when it first came out of the box.I give it a 2 instead of a 1, because I could probably send it in and get it fixed, but at this price it's just not worth the trouble."
2,repair kit needed to often,Every 2 months I had to replace the diaphragms which I can only find online in a kit which gives me extra parts I don't need. 1 kit costs about $20 when you include shipping its not worth it. The design is poor and this model is fairly loud. I wish I had researched better before purchasing this but the price was right at the time.
1,"Low air pressure, very loud.","I read up on various pumps and decided to get this one. I plugged it in once I got it and it was really loud, none of my other pumps make any noise but this one makes a hum I can hear in my basement (it's on the first floor). I have two air hoses hooked up, one to a 48"" flexible air tube and one to a 5"" airstone. I figured this would be more than enough to power those two devices and it was - for about a month. Then the air tube had no bubbles but the disc was going great. I figured out that one of the air valves on the pump itself doesn't work any more. I'm going to a different brand completely and will sell this one with my smaller aquarium. It's great for a small tank but horrible for anything over 20 gallons (I used it in a 55 gallon)."
1,Crappy,This was a good pump with quality bubbles but the lifespan is maybe 4 months. If you dont mind replacing this pump every 3-4 months than this is the pump for you but just know that the normal lifespan of a comparable pump is at least one year or better.
2,Plastics are durable. Rubber parts only lasted 3 months,"The rubber parts only lasted 3 months, without new rubber parts no bubbles. I was expecting this pump to last at least a year or little longer, my old pump that was from a less expensive brand and lasted longer, the pump was pumping in the same place under the tank, subject to the same pressure.The plastic of this pump is very resistant, and somehow flexible, it may be a good idea to purchase a repair kit for this pump. However, 3 months is just to short, and the kit cost almost half what the pump cost. I decided to purchase Power Head instead."
1,Junk !!! Do not waste your Money !!! I did !!!,Shortly after purchase I discovered a reduction of air flow. Quickly discovered that both diaphragms were torn. Contacted Tetra and days later I have not heard back from their customer service. Tetra has forever tainted their brand name with this piece of junk.
5,excellent controller,"I got this controller for a gift, and i was kind of skeptical of using it. but i love it. i love the feel of it and i love that it has the white and black buttons on the shoulders of the controller above the triggers. it has great range. i also really like the rubber grips. this is the only controller i use now."
3,The Giant Cheese-Log...,"Don Sullivan (Teenage Zombies) is a small town mechanic and hotrod enthusiast in this scaly classic. Hoping to become the next Elvis, Sullivan's character begins crooning at any opportunity! His friends only serve as enablers for his heinous catterwalling! He really gets going when he serenades his little sister, while playing the infamous ""banjo-lele"". Meanwhile, a gargantuan gila monster is on a rampage of destruction. No model car or toy train is safe during the holocaust! Can our wacky teens defeat this tongue-flicking horror? Is their barn-dance doomed to cancelation? Will Don Sullivan ever stop singing? Watch as these and other mysteries are solved. Recommended for immature audiences (to which I happily belong)..."
5,It's so bad it's Great!,"This is a ""classic"" cheapie atomic science fiction move from the 50""s in every sense. This RANKS right up there with ""Them"". If you have never seen the cheap 50's science fiction genre, this is a great place to start. The Gila monster ( a real Gila monster photographed in a match stick backrgound ) should have you howling with laughter. This move is jam packed with such brilliant special effects. This is a staple of midnight One Star theater movies every where or should be. To call this a b-movie is an insult to b-movies everywhere."
4,As good as any of them...,"A lot of people seem to think Norman goes off track during Captive and thereafter. I disagree. Captive is different but still goood. Hunters is as good as any of the previous books. If you llked the first 6, you'll like Hunters. It's no better, nor worse than those books."
1,Way to Small,The bag however is about half the size that it appears in the picture I was very disappointed in this packpack it way to small for my needs. I would like to know what classified as a level III more like a level one....
2,False measurements.,"I was planning on using this bag for school, but it's god awful small (I can't exaggerate this enough). Stated on the 2nd picture, it says it's 18 inches deep. It's bull, don't fall for it, I measured it myself and it was roughly 13-14 inches deep. Any Molle pack can pull off school books and supplies but struggling to fit even 2-3 college text books is a disgrace. AVOID THIS BAG"
2,Sent it Back,"This bag was much smaller than what I expected. It is not built well at all. Zippers were cheap, material is cheap, straps were cheap, etc. I have a 15"" laptop that I wanted to fit, it did, but it left no room for anything else. Pictures were deceiving. Looks cool, and would work well to carry small light things. But not to carry books, camping gear, etc in."
2,3rd Rate,I'd rather not do this one again. Just a 3rd rate production. Nothing new PLUS nothing old...just suppositions that lead nowhere.
4,Too long...,"This book was about 300 pages too long, but I can't think of any portion or subplot to cut from it. All of it seems completely necessary to the story, which is complicated, emotional and very well articulated. Peck writes from the perspective of both Amanda and Miranda as well as from the third person omniscient perspective with none of the jarring transitions other books who employ that device seem to fall prey too. The historical period clothing and home decor are vibrantly described, especially by a male writer.I picked this book up originally because of the fact that a voyage on the Titanic figures prominently in the story; however, the interlude does not seem terribly original, and a lot of what happens is foreshadowed quite heavily earlier in the book.Otherwise, though, I did enjoy the majority of the book."
5,"""Catcher"" is one of the best written works this century.","Many people criticize this book and it's author, J.D. Salinger because ofHolden's language. But that's what makes this book so real. Theuse of language that most of us use, whether we want to admit it or not, make'sthis book come alive for the reader. Another point that make's this book soreal is the fact that Holden is constantly contradicting himself. He says thatnothing ever changes, yet that's why he's so messed up. Everything is constantlyin a state of change. I think most people should read this book. It may shed somelight on the subject of life."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"Like others before me, I share the comments that this story is highly overrated, I was very dissapointed when I first read this in high school,found it to be rather dull. I have read it again, some 10+ years later and my conviction remains the same. As a point of reference, I also thought ""On the Road"" was overrated, maybe these 1950""s era efforts were simply unique in their time and have simply been romanticized through the years."
5,A Masterpiece!,"This book was almost impossible to put down once I started reading it and after finishing it I knew why. It was so easy to read the way Salinger worded everything almost like Holden Caulfield was telling his story to you in person. The characters were almost three-dimensional, making them quickly identifiable with people in real life easier than in any other book I have ever read. Also to my amazement the language seemed quite shocking to me considering it was written during the 1950's-even though I was aware that it was widely banned at that time. Still nothing can take away from this perfectly written masterpiece whom I would recommend to just about anyone."
3,The most overrated book of the 2nd half of the 20th Century,"This book was a sensation when I first read it in 1956 as a teenaged prep school boy. I loved it then. Today I can't understand what all the noise was about. Salinger was known for his alienated presence. Today this is a common trope in literature and films. The prototype of all teen angst books, it seems incredible to me that anyone can read it anymore without laughing out loud. He gets points for being early (though he was predated by decades by Stephen Dedalus, the anti-hero of James Joyce's Ulysses). All in all this book is best left a memory.EKW"
1,BUKOWSKI DID IT BETTER,"Bukowski's coming-of-age novel HAM ON RYE recounted a coming-of-age story that millions of Americans could and should relate to.It was the story of an alienated public school and working class kid who reacted to hypocracy by refusing to conform to society, unlike Salinger who brazenly promoted himself and his works by ingratiating himself with the New Yorker and New York literatti. A story about a spoiled preppy can only appeal to preppies and wannabe-preppies.People overlook Bukowski because they refuse to acknowledge their working-class similarities to the Bukster. Rather, they pretend that they too are preppy types.Caulfield's problems are self-inflicted. He's a whiny moron who deserves nothing but contempt. Readers of Salinger are gullible nuts who are just padding Salinger's bank account.If you want a real look at reality and adolescence then read more Bukowski!"
1,no redeeming qualities at all,"usually, i can see redeeming qualities in book's i dislike...but in this case, i can't understand why anyone would like such a pointless book. did i miss the point? probably...because it must have been mentioned while i was too busy screaming at how idiotic and frustrating the narrator is."
5,Stop Writing About This Book,"If you want to read the book that's fine, and if you really enjoyed the book that's great, and if you want to write about how much you enjoyed reading the book that's probably fine, too. But please don't analyze it. For my sake, of course, but also for Salinger's, and all those people out there who saw some beauty in the novel and not just some transitory self-justification. Everyone who likes Catcher in the Rye likes it because they can relate Holden, albeit tenuously in many or most cases, but just because you felt some vague simpatico connection to the main character does not mean you understand the book. Just take it as a given that the author was much smarter than you will ever be and deal with it. To quote Pete Townshend, sort of, and without any suggestion of proper context, you ""can't explain"". Or at least you can't do it very well. So don't try. Please."
4,recommended,"This book has been criticised sometimes for simply relating the frustrations of a spoilt teenager. However, I do not think that this is fair at all. The boy's cynicism is not blind, and there is much related through it all. There certainly is 'method in his madness'. Holden is one of those characters that constantly reminds you of yourself or how you used to be. The raw style of the narrative is at first shocking but I found it very easy to get into. Perhaps you have be a certain age to really enjoy it, but I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Give it a second try!,I probably wouldve hated this book if i had read it in high school.(i hated the Great Gatsby)so the Im guessing most of the people bashing it either are younger or they just arent intelligent enough to get it.Everyone has there own tastes and the book isnt action packed but thats not the point of it and for the people that dont get it should give it another read.If its not your cup of tea thats ok but the people who bash it with all the nonsense that is has no point or theme or relatable characters are either ignorant or not comfortable enough in there own skin to handle the read.
5,Depressed Teen realtes to Holden Caulfield,I am too a depressed teenger and I read the book. It depressed the hell out of me but I can relate to Holden Caulfield. :|
2,not a good pick,"I think that The Catcher in the Rye is a sad portrayl of a young and confused teenager. The book did not interest me at all and the constant use of profanity made the book even worse. There seemed to be no plot and when I thought the book was actually going some where, I ran into another dead end. It did bring up a few desent points, but other than that I have to say that I give the book a thumbsdown. I hope some liked it, but as for me, I found nothing interesting about it."
2,Profanity???,"I don't get it. Holden freaks out so bad when he reads that cuss word on the wall in Phoebe's school. And yet, on virtually every page of the book, Holden is cussing! And the bit where he says he's really glad the atomic bomb has been invented... What a gaff! Apart from that, there were some amusing bits. There really were. But come on. It's not that great, people. Try reading 1984 or All Quiet On The Western Front. Get a taste of reality."
4,Catcher in the Rye,"Upon the notice of the authors death, realized I had never read it. Interesting book........"
3,Good and fresh- though not a masterpiece,"I enjoyed this book, but would not consider it to be a great piece of literature. It was a great character, one of the best, but still not a very memorable book, in my opinion. Still recommend though, especially to teens."
3,An OK Story,"Potty-mouthed Holden Caulfield is the narrator of this story. He makes it his goal to detect the frauds in life. This book chronicles his adventures with nuns, roomates, prostitutes, and people of all sorts after he leaves Pencey Prep, a school he claims is full of phonies.I thought it did not seem to have much of a point, though it poignantly explored the relationships Holden had with some of the other characters, especially his sister, Phoebe..."
5,AWESOME BOOK!,"This book kept me interested because Holden was a characterthat I could relate to. I loved the way he thought and especially,how he talked. This was one of the greatest books i've ever read, especially for school!!!!"
3,The Rye Revisited,Some people live their lives thinking that many people are 'fake.' There you meet Holden Caufield who thinks that everyone has a fake personna about themselves. He is very negative and condradicts people. This book is very entertaining and is an easy read. Salinger uses many kinds of language to allow the reader to get what they want out of the book. It is a really good book for people who think others are fake because it makes you have an entire different outlook on life. This book was an easy read and I recommend it to people above the age of 13 because of the foul language. I really enjoyed the book though.
2,Twice now.,"Twice now I've read ""The Catcher in the Rye."" As a high school freshman, I found it difficult show sympathy towards Holden; I wasn't impressed, engaged, provoked or amused. A year and a half later I could relate much more to his sentiments, though I still don't see any quality in regards to Salinger's writing, execution or characterization. It's either a book you'll love or one you'll hate. And he hyped Pheobe up; she wasn't that interesting."
5,Conspiracy theory,"I watched the movie Conspiracy theory....through out the whole movie Mel Gibson's character kept buying The Catcher in the Rye....This made me think, I hadn't read it before, maybe I should go buy it and read it some time. So I did....It was the best book I have ever read."
5,The Teenage Mind in transition,"I've loved this book since the first time I read it in college. Holden simply thinks and ""speaks"" his mind in so many bizarre ways and yet he is so perceptive that it makes us laugh. And he also has a deep, sentimental side. He looks for his mission in life and it's simple: To be the catcher in the rye, saving children who accidentally fall off a cliff while playing. We all need a purpose in life and that's the message in part. He seeks his identity as we all do in life. It's an enjoyable read. --Fred P. Gallo, author ofEnergy TappingandEnergy Tapping for Trauma: Rapid Relief from Post-Traumatic Stress Using Energy Psychology"
3,Another classic of literature that was a disappointment,"I knew nothing at all about the plot of The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger before reading it. Turns out there really isn't much of one to speak of. This book is often included on lists of books that are considered essential reads, and after reading it, I can't figure out why. The author certainly captured a unique tone and voice which underscores the disease of youth that makes every teenager believe they know everything there is to know. Holden Caulfield is the main character/narrator, and his know-it-all arrogance coupled with his inflated sense of self-importance make him a largely unsympathetic character as he gives details of what amounts to the extended temper tantrum of a petulant, entitled brat. The novel is certainly authentically original, and credit must be given for a work that can rouse such a visceral ire and disdain for a fictional character, but taking all things into account; it's not a journey I'll bother taking again."
2,hmmmm.......,"WEll, I sure wouldn't want to argue with so many favorable opinions, but I just finished reading this book for the first time and I just thought...hmmmm..o.k. I really was not moved in any way and found the repetitive....""I really did"" etc... a little annoying. The relationship Holden had with his sister was a bit strange too."
1,Bad Book,I can sum up this book very quickly. Whiney rich brat that thinks his life is horrid. I wish my life was as bad as his.
5,How Did I Miss this Book for So Long?,"I agree with the positive reviews here . . . it is amazing that you feel you are inside Holden's head, there with his 16-year-old stresses, desires, and split-second decisions. I cannot believe anyone would rate this book low (1 star! come on!), but I know . . . to each his (or her) own. It's a classic, and I'm a little ashamed of myself that, while I've had it sitting on my bookshelf for years, I haven't discovered it first-hand until now.I would highly recommend this book for teens and pre-teens. So many of us have felt alone at this coming-of-age point in our lives."
2,A Ho-Hum WASP Tragedy.,"I very much liked the image of the catcher who keeps those kids from falling over a crazy cliff. But I had to wade through a lot of slag to find that gem. The problem is that Holden is such an unsympathetic character. He's a rich, East coast WASP who has been given several opportunities for a free education. How does he respond? Well, he can't apply himself because everyone is too phony. Hell, Holden could find phoniness lurking in a fruit bowl. What passes for tragedy in Holden's life? Losing his fencing team's foils on the subway or discovering that a seedy hotel also has seedy clientele. How can you care what happens to a character like this?Perhaps, if Holden was freed from his parent's economic bondage he could finally toss off those golden manacles; become homeless and head downtown for the free eats; stand in a soup line three times a day and finally get hit with some Freakin Real! I hate Holden, Catcher and all, I really do."
3,Mildly interesting but repetitive and over-rated.,"Because I think good literature is timeless, it bothers me when a favorite book is labeled on these pages as ""probably good when it was written but boring and dated now."" But I'd have to apply this statement to Catcher In the Rye. I first read it nearly 30 years ago but re-read it a few months ago. I can't say ""it killed me."" It just bored me."
3,Over-rated.,"I liked the book, but it is not, in my opinion, worthy of the praise which is bestowed on it. I rate a book by whether I would like to read it again, and this one I wouldn't. However, it is a book that should be read by everyone, like in high school."
3,Though an excellent book...,"I understand all these excellent reviews do have backing, I can't continue to read it. Salinger didn't intend to make ypou all happy, he was shpwing the effects of his life in literaure. For example the theme of phoniness. His mom changed her name so that her husband's family would except her."
1,Through the Eyes of the Depressed,"Unfortunately, I had to read this book for school as an assignment, and of course, I had do those review questions for tests and so forth. Well, I have to be honest, I don't like this book. I mean, I think the plot is powerful and the point of view is, but it's not only confusing, but it gets on your nerves. Holden Caufeild is the most irritating character I've ever read in a book! Every word he says is like hearing nails being scratched against a blackboard. If I knew this guy, I would say to him, ""Look, if you want to see a real phoney, look in the mirror and you'll see him!"""
2,Catcher in the Rye: A Masterpiece?,"At first I looked forward to reading Salinger's Catcher in the Rye - after all, it is a classic, right? I wanted to like the book; really, I did. But I couldn't.J.D Salinger begins his novel from the perspective of Holden Caulfield, a teenage boy who talks of how he ends up in his current position in a rest home for therapy. Holden speaks to readers directly as he recounts the events that lead up to his being sent away. I expected the tale of some horrific event to unfold, instead I was informed of Holden's expulsion from school, his dilemma of having to tell his parents, and some things that happen in between. Nothing really happens.The book is written like a drab, repetitive rant and gets annoying fast. Upon completing the novel, I felt as if I had read an entirely different novel from the Catcher in the Rye that everyone seems to rave on and on about. Maybe it's just lost some of its flair with age; or perhaps, it's just gotten too overrated."
4,A true classic,"I picked up this book because it seemed to be one of those classics you're ""supposed"" to read, expecting it to be dense and archaic, but it was actually very entertaining. It involves a wealthy prep-school student, Holden Caulfield, searching for something true and genuine in a world that seems to be made out of pretention and ""phonies."" The stlye is simple and surprisingly blunt (Holden goes out and says ""It depressed the hell out of me"" several times) but other parts are extremely subtle. With humor and angst (and no overkill on either one), Catcher in the Rye really is one of those books that everyone should read at least once."
2,not the best,"I personally didn't like this book, contrary to the fact that it is considored a classic I didn't think that the book was all that inetersting, it was only 2demensional. If you want to read a beautifully written and interesting book about human nature, read one flew over the cuckoo's nest, otherwise, who wants to read a book about a kid complaining about everything."
4,Sixteen forever,"Oooh, if Holden Caulfield could hear all these people calling this book a ""masterpiece"" or a ""classic,"" he'd puke. The book is still very fresh after all these years, and awfully funny. After rereading it recently, I realized how many of our good writers of the past twenty years, people like Raymond Carver, Don Delillo, Lorrie Moore, Thom Jones, and Gish Jen, owe a debt to J.D. Salinger. I also realized how sweet he is, Holden Caulfield, and how lonely. He breaks my heart. What do you imagine becomes of him? He won't be happy, will he?"
4,An Incredible Book,"I would just like to say, that most of the people who wrote the reviews above didn't even understand the book. True, the book is about a couple of days in a sixteen-year-old's life, but there is a point, a reason in which Holden Caulfield explains about those particular days of his life. There is a process of alienation which occurs throughout the book and finally comes to a hidden conclusion at the end of the book, which results in having to read the last chapter very carefully to find out about Holden's whereabouts at that point. I had to read the last chapter three times before I finally understood where he really was and why he didn't give details in that chapter. All in all, this is a fantastic book about alienation and adaptation only for those who truly understand it, and for those who don't understand the meaning, it is a funny story about a cynical teenager's life."
4,This was a very good book!!,"The Catcher In The Rye was a very good book. Holden Caulfield, the main character, described in detail about a couple days of his life. However, he may have openly expressed himself a little too much but the book was well written otherwise. I would recommend this book to any teenager who has not read it yet. I could relate to what Holden was saying and I'm sure everyone else can as we have days like his."
4,Classic Literature,"I recently made a vow to reread some books I had skimmed getting through my high school English classes. I knew I had to read Catcher in the Rye, what a great work that was well worth the time it took to finish the book.This book read like a building top of a roller coaster, you never knew what was going to come after the top of the coaster, then you plunged down and twisted around inside Holden's brain and all around his journey towards New York City and his frivilous spending and wild times and adventures.I relate a lot to Holden as I am someone who often has learned to hard way in life. Holden seems to refuse to do things the way he is supposed to, and I love the character for that.You really should not go through life and not read this book."
4,The Best Book That I Have Read in Years,"""The Catcher in the Rye,"" By J. D. Salinger was one of the best books that I have read in a very long time. The main Character, Holden Caulfield, in my opinion was a whinny immature, little child, like many people I know. I did not sympathize with him when he would complain about anything and everything or when he would get into trouble. I did however like the main message, in my opinion, that I believe Salinger was trying to portray, which was that you need to find out who out who you really are. This book was fabulous, and I would recommend it to just about anyone."
3,Mediocre book about a pointless life.,"If the current take on life is that it's pointless, then this book captures the modern mood. While Dostoyevsky specialized in showing the negation involved in centering one's life on anything other than the Ultimate, Salinger's book is about the pointlessness of it all. He's a master ironist, for the pointless things include his book! I'd never want to spend ten minutes with this guy. Unfortunately, the book is often given to kids to read in their late teens, when they're already at the point of questioning everything. No wonder Turgenev's Bazarov has so much (second-rate) company. A truly malign book."
2,Depressed Young Man,"In the novel The Catcher in the Rye the author J.D. Salinger writes of a teenage boy who has once again been kicked out of school and leaves a few days before the start of break. He leaves to New York city where he goes through many hardships and we find that he has had a nervous breakdown. I find this story to be boring and repetitive, and I find the amount of bad words disturbing though possibly correct for a boy of his age.Holden Caulfield is a sad, depressed young man but I never feel sorry or bad for him. He never seems to be very important to me and I do not care for the character, though there is much that I would wish to change about him."
3,"i haven't read it yet, so i'll give 3 stars for now.",can someone tell me if it is true that a lot of serial killers have read this book and it became their favouite? my friend told me this and i was curious if it was true or not.
1,Why is this considered a classic?!?,"A rambling accounting of about 3 to 4 days in the life of a teenager named Holden Caulfield. Holden is mentally unstable, and a bit distraught over being expelled from another expensive boarding school. There is absolutley no plot. It is exactly like reading the mind of a teenager with no personal motivation, or ambition. Mildly amusing, mildly depressing, rampant profanity.This is the worst book I've read in a long time. Yes, that includes the House of Night series, and the Cirque Du Freak! I was very disappointed. I would recommend this to anybody who likes to slow down at the scene of a vehicle accident for the sake of curiosity. It offers no literary value or edification whatsoever.When I started reading it, I kept expecting it to get better, or make some kind of point. When I realized it wasn't going to improve, I felt far enough invested in it, that I decided to finish it reguardless of my low opinion."
1,I don't get it,"The Catcher in the Rye has been touted as one of the greatest literary works of the 20th century. I had always meant to read it and finally got around to it just recently. I must say I do not see the ""masterpiece"" quality to the writing nor was it much of a story, quite frankly. I would bet that if this were floated to publishers today it would never see the light of day."
4,A love/hate relationship with Catcher in the Rye,"This is a book that I hate to love. And it may sound strange, but it's the things in this book that I dislike that makes me like it so much.Holden, (the 16-year-old main character) uses certain words and phrases in practically every other sentance which gets really annoying, but it's these times that his character becomes so real and likeable to me. He has a 'voice' that is both common and unique at the same time. I found myself smiling, if not laughing, alot - which is always a sign of good writing. I think my favourite part is when Holden is pondering the phrase F*** YOU. To me, his thoughts here are very deep and profound. These few paragraphs gave me the best 'image' into how he sees himself and the world around him.The 'Catcher in the Rye' may not be the greatest book ever writen, however, I certainly think it is worth the read, and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,That killed me!,"This book is such a phoney! Holden was so annoying, this was 200 pages of a depressed protagonist, which isn't very fun."
4,Uh.....good book,"I liked this book cuz the guy who tells the story is funny because his thoughts just trail off sometimes. This book has ALOT of swearing so if that bothers you, you wont like it. But overall its a good story."
1,Filthy,"This is a disgusting, filthy book that should, God-willing, NEVER infect another child's mind"
1,Torture in the form of words,"It baffles me to no end that anyone would give this book a five star rating or that it is considered a literary classic with a ""powerful"" theme. Not only is it intellectually barren, but is horribly written. Tedious and repetetive, it is literally the worst book I have ever encountered. It should be banned, not because of controversial language or subject matter, but so it cannot be inflicted on humanity any longer. It is truly a crime that this book is elevated to a position of equality with works like To Kill a Mockingbird."
2,I did'nt like the end of this book.,"The book was a good one in the whole, but the ending was not fulfilling. The ending leaves many questions unanswered."
4,The Catcher In The Rye by: J.D. Salinger,"I thought this book was a very interesting book to read. This is a very good book about a young man going though some tough times in his life. The book takes place during only four days, but in these four days you get to know the main character very well. One of the reasons I thought this was a good book was because I can relate to it because I'm a teenager and the book is about a teenager. You also meet up with a very interesting character whose name is Phoebe. She was my favorite character in the book even though she was only in the book for about the last fifty pages. Everyone I have talked to that read this book shared my opinon that this was a very good book. For this reason I would recomend this book to anyone no matter what age, race, or sex. READ THIS BOOK!"
3,Very good but a bit loony at times,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this wasn't my favorite book. Does that mean I don't understand it? No. I do understand the character and what he is going through. I understand that he trying to maintain a bit of his childhood innocence and has trouble coping with the phoniness and weirdness of adult society.However, his rambling really did become unnerving at times. I actually know someone who still talks like this in his late 40's and I can only handle it in small doses.The dialogue does ramble on & on at times and I found myself shaking my head.I'm glad I read it and I think it is important but I do not think it will be for everyone."
2,readable but just,"i realise this book is of note given the time it was published and its stayle, however i think in todays age it is decidely average and ot worth reading unless you have a desire to get a perspective of what would have been revolutionary at the time of its publication."
4,The book is entertaining. Perhaps a better read when read as a teenager.,"The Catcher in the Rye is written in the first person and tells the story of a teenager, HOLDEN CAULFIELD, who is struggling with the normal teenage crisis of misdirection and apathy. I don't remember reading this book in High School. Perhaps it was assigned and I ignored it.I believe the story would have resonated more with me when I was about Holden's age (16) than it does now. The book is an easy read and the story and characters are very real. Why is it a classic? I don't really know, perhaps it was ahead of its time; perhaps the prose was unconventional. I enjoyed the story but didn't feel much connection with the characters even though Holden reminded me of kids I knew in High School, perhaps even a little bit of me. Enjoy!"
5,The Catcher in the Rye is a Classic for a good reason.,"Catcher has a beautifully written monologue tone. The first page of the novel is like no other, ""who is this person addressing me,"" the reader thinks. Holden Caulfield and his apathetic attitude reach out and tell the reader to take a look at this - this person is just like me in this manner, or that manner. I hope that everyone can find a peice of themselves in Holden Caulfield."
4,Funny and Enlightening,"I read Catcher in the Rye as a re-introduction to classic American literature outside of high school reading requirements. The first few chapter were surprisingly funny but then it gives the reader an insite into how a depression affects a person. Holden had everything, good parents, great schools and money at his disposal but it couldn't keep him from being depressed and isolated from society. Definately read this book!"
1,"Boring, written in teenagerish slang.","Perhaps I am too old for it (I am 26) but I found the book extremely boring. Three days in the empty life of a teenager simply do not interest me. Moreover the book is written in a very irritating teenagerish slang. If your novel is about an ox, you should not write as an ox would."
5,A book I should have read 40 years ago...,"A book I should have read 40 years ago. A brilliant portrayal of cynical adolescence and the transition to adulthood. Brought to life in the journey made by Holden Caulfield through New York City in a weekend. Holden seeks to find his way out of confusing darkness following his expulsion from school. Captures the growing pains out of childhood and the doubts and fears of moving forward into adulthood in a most stunning way. The image of the catcher in the rye saving children from falling into the abyss of adulthood, as seen by Holden, is memorable. Rightly acclaimed as one of the great literary works of the 20th century."
3,Catcher in the Rye,"The Catcher in the Rye follows a teenage boy who is searching for understanding. Holden wants to find someone, anyone who will relate to him only to find himself annoyed by the phoniness of the world. The adolescence that was stolen from him by the death of the brother he idolized, forces Holden to realize he only wishes to be able to preserve the innocence of the world. Wishing he could become the ""catcher in the rye"" and save children from growing up. Although I cannot really relate to the character, I can relate to being frustrated with the trivialness of the world. I would recommend this book to any high school students that have yet to find themselves. It is a quick read and gives insight to growing up and finding your true self."
2,Would make a better short story,"Okay, we'll do the good stuff first. ""Catcher"" has an easy to read style that is quite unique. The reader really gets into Holden's head. And Holden is a truly believable person. However, he is not at all a typical teenager. He's a teenager on the brink of an emotional breakdown. And Salinger really convinces you of that.What's annoying about this book is the complete lack of a plot. Modern readers expect a book to have a beginning, a middle and an end. I understand that not every great book has to have a well-defined plot, but this one doesn't even have a loosely defined plot. Holden leaves school and wanders around New York for a few days, slowly getting crazier and crazier. The style of the book is wonderful, but it would have made a much better short story."
1,this is what wastebaskets are for...,"Catcher in the Rye is possibly the weakest novel I have ever suffered through. It is a constant whine session in which only the background changes. It is even a poor example of angst literature. If you want a real classic in the field try Jack Kerouac's Maggie Cassidy. Otherwise, avoid purchasing this book. If you already wasted the money, you may join me in throwing it into the trash."
1,I actually threw this book at the wall when I finally finished it,"I don't understand why this is such a classic, and why so many people love it. There is basically no real plot to the story, it's just a bunch of boring rambling. If Holden Caulfield were a real person, I would want to slap him in the face. He is an ungrateful hypocrite, and he says ""phony"" way too much. Even though it's a short book and an easy read, it still took me forever to finish it because it just dragged on and on with no point. Skip this one."
1,Boring...,"A more appropriate title would have been ""Spoiled teen in severe need of an attitude adjustment has 3 days and a hundred-odd bucks do burn, and does so by stumbling around New York City like a drunken homeless man."""
3,It was a disappointment for me.,"I didn't like 'The Catcher in the Rye' a lot. Though there were a few good things I admired. The reason I dislike it, is because I can't compare myself with the 16-year old boy, who is feeling depressed all the time. I feel sorry for him that he has such a lousy life. But it's basically his own fault: he makes a mess of his life the whole time and he doesn't take anything serious. He just spends his parents' money. And I find it really pathetic that his only real friend is his sister! The use of language is always the same:he uses a lot of negative words. And the whole book is about 4days, it is way to detailed. And that gets boring after a while. The only positive thing I can say about it, is that I admire the fact that it was written in 1950 and still a lot of young people can compare themselves with it. So it's not the fact that I hate reading novels, but this one was just a disappointment for me."
3,"It has a point, but rambles","This book is considered a classic contribution to American literature. I see the value in Holden's journey of self discovery, but do not think it was as good as billed. Salinger repeats himself and seems to ramble throughout the book. He often digresses from his original thought. Despite this fairly annoying habit, Salinger does provide a unique glimpse into the life of a private school dropout in the forties as he tries to find himself. I have read worse, but have also read much better."
1,Regarding The Catcher in the Rye,"This is, without question, the most overrated book that I have had the grave misfortune to encounter. I will grant that, in its day, the book was probably read as a refreshing challenge to the generally accepted understanding of what it means to be a youth, but, by today's standards, Holden is a seventeen year old kid struggling through a sixth grade existential crisis.This book has not aged well."
5,Always amazing,I read this every now and then to remember what it's like to see the world as only you wish to see it. Timeless.
5,THE BEST BOOK!!!!!!,This book was great! I hardly ever read and i was glued to the book!! It really related to teenagers and he wrote the i think!!!Everyone should read it!
1,J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye,"I first read ""The Catcher..."" while in High School as a required reading assignment.My impression of this story was so great that I started and finished in one go. It is the book that got me interested in reading. As a result, I purchased this book as a gift to my grandson who happens to be an advid reader at the age of 5 years."
1,poor seller,I ordered the book over a month ago. Still waiting for it.... I have contacted the seller and he has yet to reply. Don't buy from this seller!
3,"a REAL story, but it seems to drag on","The story and characters are real to life with the problems of teenagers, but Holden (the main character) seems to complain a little too much. The book starts off well and then drags on, and on with all the stuff and people he hates. I would still recomend reading it though."
1,A classic?,"I read this book because it is considered a classic. That was the only reason I finished it. I absolutely hated this book. To me it was the whining of an adolescent crybaby, nothing more. I really can't understand how this came to be a ""classic."""
5,DUDE,"This is a great book. It really relates to real life. I can't see why anyone would want to ban this really cool book, but that is just my opinion."
4,"5 copies of ""catcher in the rye""","I ORDERED 5 COPIES FOR OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BOOKCLUB. I THOUGHT THE VENDOR (SMOKEY MTN BOOKS,INC) GAVE US GOOD SERVICE AND NEW BOOKS; HOWEVER,I CONSIDER THE POSTAGE FOR 5 PAPERBACK BOOKS, $19.95, SHIPPED ALL IN ONE LARGE ENVELOPE, WAS EXORBITANT--ALMOST DOUBLED THE PRICE OF THE BOOKS ($41.20). THE ITEM PRICE WAS IN THE CATALOG, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLE TO GIVE US A BULK DISCOUNT.THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE BOOK."
4,Catcher in the rye review,"I think that this book was very good. It showed how authors have the freedom of writing. And the fact that J.D. wrote about a kid with problems, it showed how people should see the world. The way Holden Caufeild speaks about this ""great nation of ours"", makes us think, ""Man, is that what we all sound like??"""
4,"Um, its OK","After reading all these reviews, I don't know what to think. You could write a book on just the REVIEWS of this book. Its no Lord of the Flies, but its ok. And to all the parents out there offended by the book, spend a day at your kids school, and you'll find Holdens ""vulgar"" vocabulary mild and infantile in comparison to the average student...or teacher."
2,Gloom despair and agony on me,"I couldn't stand this book in high school, and I can't stand it now!I couldn't stand it in high school because I found it very depressing.... full of despair and gloom. Perhaps the author should have had Holden commit suicide somewhere in the early chapters... then he could have spared us the agony of reading about his pathetic life.I can't stand it now because the language is coarse and crude, beyond where it needs to be.I guess the author thought it was either important or fun to have us rattle around inside of Holden Caulfield's head...Really though. it could have all be summarized by that 4 line diddy on Hee Haw...""Gloom, despair and agony on me-e!Deep dark depression, excessive misery-y!If it weren't for bad luck I'd have no luck at all!Gloom, despair and agony on me-e-e!""There, now you don't even need the Cliff's Notes version."
4,Great reading,"Although I did not necessarily like the ending, the rest of the book was very well written. It kept me reading way past the time I should have stopped each time I picked it up. It's easy reading and not particularly a long story. Enjoyed it very much."
4,I like tis book!,"I think, the catcher in the rye is a really good book! I have some English books to read for school, and this one was very nice. Holden Caulfield is always saying about people who are phonies, but I think he's a phony! Though, the book is fine and easy to read."
5,This book is very interesting.,"It is very unique, unlike any other book I have read. I thought the plot was a little weak but for those who like great American literature would adore this novel."
3,Easy Reading,"I bought the book because I knew it was a classic. I didn't know anything about it when I started reading. My first impression was one of humor. I smiled to myself as I read Holden Caulfield's comments and perceptive observations about people.The bond between reader and protagonist is made right from the start. Salinger writes in a very conversational style. It flows easily. The use of short and succinct phrases and sometimes one word sentences makes a sharp point. Salinger is a deft writer, entertaining his reader with his colorful language and writing style. I found it hard to put the book down especially as I gained momentum and read to the final chapter. I liked the insight given into Holden's life experiences and innermost thoughts and emotions. He is, by his own admission, a very depressed young man trying to deal with the challenges life hands him. I was however, slightly disappointed with the ending."
5,fast shipping and reliable seller.,I recieved this book really fast and was in the condition described by the seller. This book is about a 16 year old boy who wants to live in a child's innocent world and not in an adult's corrupted world. I definetly recommend it.
4,the Catcher in the Rye,"A good book depicting thoughts of a youth who doesn't know where he belongs yet while he ""puts down"" most actions of others. A book for youth; a bit tiresome reading for adults."
5,A male point of view...,"Salinger presents the hardships of growing up through a male point of view in Holden, and it was very easy to identify with his overall disgust of the world and some of its more ""phony"" members. However, the narration is not necessarily geared toward males or teenagers. There are universal themes to be found here, hence making this novel the classic that it is."
4,teenagers unite!,"i read this book because of the acclaim it received from my fellow teen readers, the only critics whose reviews i will acknowledge. they said that i would be able to relate to Holden, and that his cyncism and bitterness would be familiar to me. from this description, i expected an intelligent, profound, thoughtful character who was misunderstood by the rest of the world, and frustrated by the lack of understanding he was getting from those around him. holden did not fit this description-actually i did not find him to be intelligent at all. but i think what makes the book so amusing and thought-provoking IS holden's immaturity. the reader is not threatened by him, since his character has a humorous pretentious quality that is endearing and not bothersome. the book didn't cause any deep questions and about the meaning of life to arise, but instead provided a succint, comical, and thoughtful celebration of teenage existence and the thought process of the undeveloped mind."
4,Excellent,The book taps into the life of a troubled boy. Many men can identify with Holden. I felt as though Salinger described what growing up as a male was all about. I have read the book twice and still feel as though I do not completely understand everything. I do understand and identify with many things that the boy is feeling throughout the book.
3,Should have read it in high school,"So...I know this is a supposed classic and it sooo great and blah blah blah pffft. But, I did not like it. I don't know if it's because I didn't read it in high school like everyone else but read it later in life when I just wanted this whiny spoiled rich kid to shutttt upppppp. I also didn't care for the writing style - some may call it simple prose, I call it crap that my cat could write (and probably would. My cat has a similar sense of entitlement to that of Holden Caulfiend - oops, I mean Caulfield) Now, I try not to let this influence my opinion of J.D. salinger's other celebrated work as I have not yet read anything else by him and I hear Frannie and Zooey is amazing. So, yeah, there you have it. Didn't like Catcher in the Rye, so sue me."
2,catcher in the rye,"my first thought after finishing it was, ""i must have read a different 'catcher in the rye' because this certainly can't be the book that i have heard soooooo many great things about."" i just don't know what other to say...i was extremely disappointed in this boring, never changing book. you could have read the same chapter 20 some odd times over again and gotten the gist of this book. i believe i would have had a different opinion if i had the chance to read it when it was written in the fifties, the concept might have seemed revolutionary back then. nowadays, its just normal, everyday teen life...and thats a bore. i'll leave you with nothing, because that is exactly what this book left me with."
1,AWEFUL,"What did I do Santa ?Why did you leave me this lump of coal in my stocking?I am not sure if this was left by santa in my stocking or by the neighbors dog on my porch.The main character was unlikeable.The dialogue was repetitive - IT REALLY WAS.I got very tired of the format "" Pronoun REALLY is/was/did/etcIf I had a dollar for every time he used - It REALLY was, they REALLY do, I REALLY am, blank REALLY blank...I know this was controversial in its time, but I dont think anyone thought it was particularly subversive or thought provoking. I think they just had something against crumby fiction with excessive and meaningless profanity.If Santa leaves this lump of coal for you, shoot that fat bastard!"
1,Horrible waste of time,"This supposed classic was a boy ranting at the world over a few days span. It was nothing more than a teenage boy talking crap to everyone and saying he didn't care about anything that happened to him. A lot of GD's and Christsakes. It was the worst 5 or 6 hours I ever spent. I won't be reading anything that may be published after he died, not based on this book."
1,The catcher In The Rye,As of today I have not completed this book. So far I have been very disappointed. It is not for children to read as it is so vulgar it disgust me. I am no prude but it seems no sentence is complete with out repeated curse words. Louise
1,"Don't be duped into believing ""critics"".","Having never read ""Catcher"" in high school (and thinking that I was missing out on something) I picked it up one day at the library and will share with anyone that'll listen what a load of crap this book is. Yes, it's cynical and full of youthful angst but with no point, no moral, no closure. I don't wish to add to the time I wasted reading it to comment any further. The only reason I rated this with 1 star, is that there was no option for no starsIf you've got the time, spend it reading other required high school books, i.e. ""1984"", ""Animal Farm"", ""The Scarlet Letter"" or ""Tom Sawyer""- time much better spent."
5,this book can change your life if you're not careful.,"Many years ago, I gave my beloved copy of The Catcher in the Rye to my college boyfriend--a dark, sensitive soul who I fancied a modern Caulfield. Weeks, then months passed, and he never mentioned it -- didn't exclaim how Salinger's character so perfectly embodied his own alienation. Well, the relationship lasted for years, but that shabby paperback always haunted me: why did he not understand the enormity of what I had given him? Turns out, he wasn't the misunderstood one, I was. Thanks, Holden"
4,Teen Angst,"There is nothing that I can add that hasn't already been said about this book. But it was an important book to me in my teen years. Feeling lost, this book made me feel as if someone out there understood me. And for that I will forever be grateful to JD Salinger. May he dance with angels."
5,A Timeless Classic - Masterpiece of adolescence,"I first read this book in college in a class about banned books. I immediately fell in love with it. It was an assignment that was delightful and thought provoking. Over the years I still go back to this book and discover new insights every time I read it.Catcher is a tale of an ordinary teenager (and a quite sensitive one) trying to make sense of the world. I truly wished it was longer because I didn't want to stop reading about Holden.Ok, if I haven't convinced you yet, I named my son Holden!This is a must read!"
2,Did Not Like,"I am sure I am in the minority of people who did not like this book. I found it boring and long winded at times. Now I can see where this book was groundbreaking for its day and age and I can appreciate the controversy that surrounds out, but on an entertainment/enjoyable level it missed the mark completely with me. I read ""Nine Stories"" and really liked it (especially ""Teddy""), but this book ended any desire for me to ever read Salinger again."
