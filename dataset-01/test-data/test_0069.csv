2,Others are right about ping sound and un-inflatedness,"There are three undeniable comments in the reviews, which I've also experienced:1) A hollow, metallic ping every time it bounces. I'm playing here at a university indoor court, and every group of guys I play with has commented ""hey, this ball sounds weird."" When the game ball is chosen, this is the first they toss away. The ping has the quality of the inflated ""Thunderstix"" that are distributed at MLB playoff games.2) A regulation full size ball should be inflated between 7.5 and 8.5 lbs PSI. This Never Flat ball seems to come on the low end of that. Despite only receiving it two weeks ago, guys at the gym have all said that it bounces flat. Although nobody wants to hear whiny comments about their new item, I have to agree on the lack of bounce. Over a year of this before I can inflate it??3) Having read others reviews, I now understand why I'm typing with small cuts on my left index and right middle fingerpads. It's on the rough side for bballs."
1,Dark and Scary,"Wow, when you think about sweet Pooh, you'd never guess that someone could screw this up so badly. This movie was dark and scary. Everything from the music, mood and decor. Not recommended for small children."
5,An outstanding book about literary theory,"This is an outstanding book about literary theory and the academy. A professor of mine recommended it to me as an undergraduate, along with Terry Eagleton's Literary Theory: An Introduction, and I found this one to be the more interesting, the more original, of the two. It is at once a history and a critique and has much to offer students and scholars alike. Unfortunately, Graff seems to have fallen prey in his later work to some of the sophistries that he criticized in this early work."
1,Product Is Not Sealed,"This product did not come sealed. When I tried to return it through to the Therapy Connection, they refused to return the product due to the fact that it isn't sealed. Well, how can I use it when it did not come sealed? Just as the company is not allowing me to return it for sanitary reasons I can't use it for sanitary reasons. Unless you don't mind a product of this type being opened and possibly used, buy from another seller and ask whether or not it comes sealed."
4,A good book but not for beginners,"Yes, perhaps a little slow on the introduction and a drag for those of who had a beginners course in quantum physics or a college physical science background. But the author does an excellent job, in my opinion, of explaining in detail WHY it is that we're searching for SUSY, not just the buzzwords of this science for the impressionable readers. It also keeps a good psychological reality check, and defends certain theories over others; a very honest and unbiased book, and an interesting one too. Thanks!"
3,Subtitled,"I wasn't aware this was a subtitled movie, so right there made this somewhat difficult to watch. It's about a guy who got paralyzed after a diving accident. He wants to have the right to chose to end his life so his spirit can be freed from the jail of his body. It gets a little weird when a woman who has a radio show falls in love with him, and then a married female lawyer who assists him with a court case to press for his right to end of life choices also falls in love with him...and it gets even odder later. But I did like the movie giving us a look at the side of how some people feel about having to live out their entire life limited to being bed-ridden and having to have others bathe you, feed you, move you, etc."
5,The Sea Inside (Mar adentro),"This is an excellent movie, and deservedly so, as it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2004. Javier Bardem is phenomenal. Very moving, based on a true story. In Spanish with subtitles."
2,What you see is NOT what you get,"Reviewed this product once but someone must not have liked my comment. Yes, the socks are adorable. I bought them for my son and daughter-in-law's baby shower. My son is a true sports nut and coaches high school soccer. However, when I received the box, it contained 2 pair of tennis socks and NO soccer socks (the main reason I purchased them). I made the suggestion that it be noted that the picture of the product may not be the same as the actual contents. Don't know whether this disclaimer is included in the description or not."
3,decent for the price,"decent for the price, shipping is killer, i used it for when i move stacks of wood pallets and the pieces of sticks and dirt fly into my face. it does the trick , as for the actual dust not so much,"
4,clear descriptions,a clearly written overview that goes nicely with the works of Alan Watts. This work explains the many facets of Mahayana Buddhism and how it relates to the others.
4,Comes with one filter,"At the time of purchase, the description for this item states that it comes with 2 filters. In fact, it only comes with one filter. This shouldn't be too big of a deal since you probably ordered the replacement filters when you purchased the respirator. Overall, I am happy with this product and it is a big improvement over disposable masks."
5,Well worth the money,"This mask works very well and is comfortable. Not only is this mask better than any other mask I have tried, but it is the only one that does not fog up my glasses. I bought it strictly for wood working, to keep out dust, not fumes."
5,Worth every penny for the safety,"I have been building flutes for the past year and have had to use disposable dusk masks that never seemed to fit. Once you learn to pull the bottom rubber band over your head and seat the mask, then pull the other strap up and over, the mask seats, seals, and goes on easily. It is now a relief not to worry about the PVC and sometimes toxic wood dust that I was not quite getting trapped in those throwaway masks. Do yourself a favor and order extra filters. It only takes a second to be safe."
2,too small aound mouth aera.....,"I think the concept of this woodworkers respirator is great but unless your a very small person or a child these will not work. I am 5'11 and have an average size head. When these are properly installed the bottom part of my mouth is exposed and does not fit properly. When it is fitted around my mouth, it does not fit right around my nose. The rubber mask needs to be a little larger to conform around the areas it needs to cover."
4,Review of Woodworker's Respirator,"I did a lot of research on the various types of respirators. My main criteria was that it was specifically made for woodworking applications. I selected the AO Safety model 95190. I choose it because of the good reputation of AO Safety, having dual filters instead of just one, and having two straps--one for your neck and one for the top of your head to ensure a tight fit. I have used it for a year now and am completely satisfied with its performance. I would recommend it to other woodworkers."
4,Dust filter does the job,"I purchased this dust filtering mask for use in spare-time woodworking. It is far superior to the disposable dust masks I have used and conforms well to the face without discomfort, even when worn for extended periods (although I have not used it in hot, humid conditions). I may even buy a second mask for occasional visitors to my woodshop. The disposable filter inserts last quite a while and are easily replaced."
1,Wish I could give it negative stars,What a waste of time. I only kept reading it because I thought something redeeming was going to happen. The characters were not at all likeable.
2,One Trick Pony,"I am a huge fan of HBO's SEX AND THE CITY so I was excited to see what Ms. Bushnell would have to offer in this her latest book. All I can say is the FOUR BLONDES is desperately in need of a brunette, a redhead, or SOME form of diversity.The characters in the book (four shades of blonde) are completely flat and uninteresting. From the ditzy model to the career girl writer to the hopeless social climber, Bushnell's attepts at satire and humor are weak and dated.Don't get me wrong, I love clothes and shoes and vacations as much as the next girl but somehow the pursuits of these women come across as so superficial or mind-numbingly uninteresting that I didn't care one way or the other about the outcome.I'm an African American woman so I don't need to identify with these women but I would like to be ENTERTAINED! This just didn't do it for me."
3,A Vapid Version of Sex and the City,"After enjoying SEX AND THE CITY, I bought this book, Bushnell's second, in hardback. I was disappointed. The women of FOUR BLONDES are shallow, superficial and vapid, even more so than the models that litter SATC."
1,STUPID and SHALLOW,"I wouldn't recoomend this book to anyone. The whole book is shallow, the women only have sex, money, designer clothes and off the wall fantansies on their minds. This book was not worth the money or time."
2,Don't Bother,"Being a fan of the TV show Sex and the City, I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was sadly disappointed by the characters, which were shallow and cold. You don't establish a connection with them and their troubles seem rather unimportant. You just don't care what happens to them. I found the writing style unreadable in the second story due to the authors constant use of parentheses to add information to the text. I was unable to finish the book.I have tried on several occasions to pick up the book and finish it, but sadly, it is just a waste of time.Sex and the City"
3,first story is the best,"I liked the first story of the book Four Bondes. The last stories sort of tappered off at the end, but held my attention. I enjoy the stories of such different women. The high class life style in which each of the women enjoy is fun to read about. This would be a good vacation read, a little trashy, but fun."
4,Savage satire,"Bridget Jones with less heart and more money. Bushnell never gives a character an even break. Everyone is made unlikeable. Some parts are funny and perceptive but the overall effect is somewhat depressing. Her satirical targets are so remote from everyday life (even in New York and London) that the effect is more glitz than humor. One of her best riffs is on Amazon.com reviewers. ""Anything that doesn't appeal to their narrow little minds they pan."" Hmmm."
2,Should have payed attention to reviews...,"I should have paid attention to the reviews before I read this one. However, I really enjoyed Bushnell's Trading Up and Lipstick Jungle so figured that this one would be good as well. I couldn't WAIT for it to be over. Can't really put my finger on it but I hated it. However, if you haven't read Trading Up or Lipstick Jungle, you should! Don't let this one stop you...however, don't read this one. :)"
2,boring....should have read the reviews before I bought this book,"I really wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this book. I just finished Candace Bushnell's Carrie Diaries which I loved. That book was an easy, enjoyable read. This one started off ok then just kept getting worse. The book is a series of 4 different stories of New York Women. The first story wasn't that bad. But the second story was a total waste of time reading. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. I did not like the style of how that story was written either. It was just weird. I am onto the third story now, only a few pages into it and so far it has started out as bad as the second story. I hope her other books are better than this one. I wouldn't waste your time reading this book unless maybe you got it for free!"
2,Better suited for TV,"Since I don't have cable, I only see Sex in the City when at a friend's house, but I think the show is entertaining and can certainly see why it is popular. Four Blondes, on the other hand, proved to be a difficult read in that I had to discipline myself to finish it. The fourth and last section was the best and is worth reading on its own, but it couldn't make up for the lengthy third section which was the weakest piece in the book with wooden characters, who are difficult to identify with, and an overblown plot. Keep watching the TV show and skip this book."
1,Burn it.,"It's a Jackie Collins novel without a plot. I'm sure Bushnell has a point to make somewhere but the novel is so unengaging you just can't be bothered to think too much about it once you're done.If you haven't read it, don't. Rent Sex and the City instead of reading any of Bushnell's novels and you'll have done yourself a huge favour."
1,Please Don't Waste Your Money,"I was very excited when I bought this book, as I am a huge fan of ""Sex and the City"", but after getting only halfway through the book I had to stop. The characters in these stories are shallow and stale caricatures of real women. They are selfish and empty, and wander through Bushnell's weak storylines without any real purpose or ultimate goal. The language Bushnell uses is too crude for my taste, and really paints a bleak portrait of life in general. Honestly, I was a little depressed after reading this book and had to wonder how anyone could go through life like these four women and the various men that inhabit their worlds. If you enjoy the strong female friendships and witty banter in ""Sex and the City"" then don't buy this book, it will only be a waste of your time and money."
1,"Dear lord, can it BE any drearier?","Why is it that Bushnell's characters are inevitably and mind-numbingly devoid of any warmth, kindness or likeability?I didn't take to ANY of these (horrible, vitriolic) women; they were all shallow and vain and self absorbed and NOTHING AT ALL like my fabulous self. (A wee joke.) Who wants to read about thoroughly flaky women with completely skewed perspectives on life? Ugh. I'd rather watch paint dry.This was excruciating and I actually found myself angry and annoyed while reading it. Who needs the aggravation?Kbye."
3,Four Dysfunctional Blondes,"I thought that this would be an easy, light-hearted read, but it SO was not. It was easy, but one of the most dysfunctional books I have ever read. Maybe because I don't snort cocaine, drink obsessively, or whore around I didn't really feel the book.The first and fourth stories were easier to read and laugh at some of the character's actions. The second and third stories were full of pain and hate...something I don't find fun to read about. The characters in these two stories brought out physical feelings of disgust.Not a light, easy summer read."
2,4 bores,"This book was better suited for a magazine article. Each story was more boring than the previous one. These women were either bimbos or bores. The first story was so-so with a quick, wrap-it-up ending. The second was silly and dull, and by the time I got to the third one I was forcing myself to read. I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone."
4,Hot Time in the City,"You get four mini-novels here, each featuring a NY City blonde. The first blonde's story reads like chick lit with extra sex thrown in. Janey parlays her looks, her 15-minutes-of-fame, and sexual favors to gain a male with a summer house in the Hamptons each year. It's a peek into the world of NYC's rich and famous and the wannabes, like Janey, and titillating enough to keep one guiltily reading.The other stories feature a columnist disappointed in her husband's status, a socialite overwhelmed by the position she worked so hard to achieve, and a writer sampling London society and British men's sexual ability while researching an article.A thoroughly gossipy glimpse into high-powered big city lives. Some of the endings wrap up too quickly, solving the blonde's problems rather simplistically with a sudden infusion of cash (or of a man with cash). Fun reading anyway."
2,"I""m Glad I Borrowed A Copy From The Library!!!","...This book is really made up of four short stories from totally different perspectives. Taken as a whole I'd have to pan the book, but if you break this book down story by story I think you'd find a few that weren't that bad. Except for Winnie and James story. All I can say is ewwwwwww!! Still without getting into the nitty gritty plots of all four stories (that would take way to long) one should take this book with a grain of salt. ..."
2,No Sex and The City,"4 Blondes is a tale of - go figure - 4 blonde woman. Each story goes into some sort of detail about their crazed lives. Since four short stories were put together, none of them are really complete. Each character is depicted in a similar manner, which makes you forget which story you are in. The stories weren't funny, witty or ever too compelling. The author really missed on this one."
3,Not sure what to think,"Like everyone else, I love Sex and the City. I wasn't sure what to think of these four stories, though. I wasn't sure if I wasn't ""hip"" enough to get them, or if I was missing their message on some level. On the whole, I didn't like any of the stories, the characters were more annoying than anything, and the worlds they lived in were so over the top I almost thought they verged on unbelievable. There's no doubt Bushnell can create a certain kind of world, I guess I'm just not the kind of person who likes the world she created here. I was left really unsatisfied."
1,AS GOOD AS BAD SEX,"This book is boring, plain and simple. The characters were vapid. The stories were niether sexy, funny nor thought provoking. One of the characters said, ""write about what you know."" This is a sad commentary about the author. I was in the mood for an empty book; but this was just too empty. Even the writing was bad (VERY BAD). Don't waste your money or time."
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible,"I wish Amazon.com had a 'zero stars' rating, because it doesn't even deserve one star! I can only think of one other time I have tried to read a book as bad as this. I couldn't even get past the first 10 or so pages of each chapter, the characters were so abhorent. The writing style is completely devoid of imagination. I hope Candace Bushnell is taking a gander at these reviews, maybe she'll pay attention and retire from writing. I want my money back!"
3,Couldn't put it down,"Very enjoyable book. It's four stories. The first was a little too neatly wrapped up at the end. The second was deliciously evil. The third was kind of disconcerting. The fourth was sort of abrupt, too.But, all good. I'm a New Yorker and I don't live a life like this (but I have worked for womens magazines!). I'm glad I don't live a life like these women."
2,So bad in this book and so good in Sex and the City.,"This book was a total disapointment. I am a ""Sex and the City"" fan. My husband and I have watch the T.V. serie for years, we have also bought the first and second season on DVD to watch it again. That's why we bought the book.It turn out to be boring and poorly written. The worst of all was the third story, I had to make a great effort to finish it.It's almost amazing how someone can do so well in one thing and at the same time so bad on another one.Well, I guess I will keep watching my favorite ""Sex and the City"" and forget I ever read this book."
3,Brit Backlash,"After reading 'Sex and the City' I was compelled to read 4 Blondes. It started with Bushnell's rapier wit and clever innuendo and I prepared for what I thought would be an enjoyable and informed read for the modern woman. However, I was disapointed and angry regarding the constant reference to the Brits...."
1,4 Bores,"A tedious book about unlikeable people.If this is life in the city, I'm glad I'm a hick from the sticks."
2,Don't waste your money on the hardback like I did.,"Janey Wilcox, main character of one of the four short stories, inspires absolutely no sympathy. The only thing that interested me about her was why she was as money-hungry as she was and why she wasn't looking for love. The rest of the stories are way below my expectations as compared to Sex in the City. The story of the journalists was uninteresting and not very plausible. I skimmed the rest of them and they were similarly boring. If you must read this book, first, don't buy the hardcover, and second, don't say I didn't warn you."
4,Good stories,This is a good combination of four stories about women at different stages in their lives. It was a nice read and very enjoyable.
1,Tragic,"As a loyal fan to the fabulous Sex and the City comedy, I was looking forward to an entertaining tale of four women and their interesting lives, instead I got four cynical, overly exagerated stories. Rather than four women dealing with the successes and failures of their lives, I found four women caught up in their materialistic ways, only to be accentuated by sex, drugs, and their inability to contribute to society. The only remotely sane character was in the final story, but at that point I was too annoyed to care. The only reason I finished the book was in hopes of finding some redeaming factor, however, none was found...."
2,God help these women!!,"This sort of New-York-Women-on-the-prowl-for-richer-men thing has been done before &, to my mind, a bit better, by Rona Jaffe in her novels from the 50s & 60s. Funny how the more things change, the more they remain the same - particularly when it comes to those who aspire to pointless, trendy, showy wealth. Still, these stories are mostly light fun reads - with characters you love to hate. I particularly enjoyed the marriage between the 2 soulless Yuppies, but felt disturbed by the ongoing theme throughout the book...do women like this really exist in any sort of numbers? Bushnell's got a strong, on-target, witty voice for this sort of character, but I didn't really, in the end, want to spend THIS much time with them."
1,Not worth the money,"I read Sex and the City and Four Blondes back-to-back. I loved the clear voice in Sex and the City, and looked forward to hearing it again in the next book; but that was voice was missing in Four Blondes. I was bored and kept asking myself why I kept reading. The disjointed stories were just Sex and the City ""Lite."""
4,"This book is not titled ""Sex and the City""","This book does not have the same humor as ""Sex in the City"" does. If you're looking for the same funny, lighthearted comedy that takes place on that HBO show, do not buy this book. That said, I personally think this book is hilarious. It's a very, very dark comedy - a great satire of New York ""privledged"" life. It's one of my favorite books."
2,"Good, Boring & I want to hurry up and get this over with","I have not read Candice Bushnell's books in order. In fact I read Trading Up first. I really shouldn't have picked this one up at all. The first chapter is pretty good. Then you go to the second chapter which get more boring as it moves, rather crawls along. The third chapter was truely draining but did pick up a bit towards the end. Overall, just leave this one alone."
3,I wish the stories had intertwined more...,"Overall each of the four novellas were very interesting to read. Bushnell did a job job of giving each character her own personality.But, I kept waiting for these four women's lives to meet up, and effect eachother in some way, and that never happened. Because it never happened, I felt that there was something lacking in each of the stories because the endings were so open, and there was no sense of closure."
1,Save your $$$$$,"This book is not even worth 1 star! Save your money, don't spend it on this garbage."
2,This book was not worth reading,This book was not well written and the characters were not likeable. If you have to read this book definitely wait for the paperback.
1,Just a bad read all around - author obsessed with anal sex!,"I picked up this book because I had enjoyed the tv show 'Sex and the City.' This book is nothing like that. There are no redeeming qualities in any of the characters, and I didn't like anyone in this book. I kept reading it thinking it had to get better, but sadly, I was wrong. The stories just had no point and really, no endings. The author also seemed obsessed with the idea of anal sex, since it is mentioned in all four parts of the book. I definitely would not recommend this book."
2,"Exciting technology, but many errors","There are far too many typos (source codes, etc) in this book to recommend it to anyone. Bet the author wrote this book with one of those devices."
3,Good,I bought Edward to go along with our HO Thomas engines. It is a fun toy for your HO trains. Edward arrived brand new like I bought it in the store.
1,Compatibility Problem With Timeport P8167,"Although this battery is listed to be compatible with the Motorola Timeport P8167 wireless phone, it doesn't fit. Size is slightly smaller than the P8167's original battery, so this battery will not snap in to the battery compartment."
1,Hard to do what the title says.,One of the most boring horror films ive seen in a long time.I recently watched this on netflix last night horrible acting hilarious killer a demon barney costume that is pathetic in more ways then one.The deaths are bloodless badly done and boring as is this entire film as well.Skip it seriously watching paint dry is more interesting then this boring waste of time.
5,A Precursor to 21st Century America,"If you want to know where the current Obama administration derived the course of their policies, you might want to review what the Progressives put in place during the FDR years. It is a must-read for students of American history. It also answers the question of why there has been a dumbing down of education in our country."
2,disappointed,showed assorted colours...received only one colour that wasn't even shown. Should have been noted in the description somehow. Would not reorder
5,I love Paula Nadelstern's techniques!,"Paula Nadelstern is such an artist! Although I have not completed a quilt using her techniques, I enjoy reading and studying her work. Someday I will get a quilt done, but for now it's the small projects for me."
3,we want Kanga and Roo!!,we like Book of Pooh but we miss Kanga and Roo as part of the gang in the movie.....PLEASE put them in the next movie you make!
1,book of pooh (as in complete poop),"This turkey bites buy the tigger movie instead disney should dip the puppeteers, and computer animaters who conspired to foist this piece of poo off on the public in winnies honey and tie them to an anthill in the hundred acres woods.I loved pooh when I was a kid and so do my kids but I took this one back and exchanged it for the tigger movie which the kids actually liked ."
3,Ike and Tina,"This cd is not exactly a staple for Tina fans but it is worth the 5 dollars. Includes Fool in Love, Come Together, and my personal favorite Oh MY My."
4,Very impressed with the concept!!,"This book really made me wonder: did Jesus really have a guardian angel? I read this book before I read Angelwalk, and had to go back and look at it again. The irony of Jesus having a guardian angel who believed at one time Satan was unfairly punished was just amazing.This book also made Jesus a little more human to me. Sometimes, we think of the God in Jesus so much that we forget that he went through the human experience as well. An excellent book I would recommend to anyone."
5,To Save a Life,"As a father of three HS children the movie ""To Save a life"" is one that I would like every HS kid in America to watch. The movie provides a realistic portrayal of the choices and consequences that teens make and it shows how vulnerable everyone is from the popular Capitan of the basketball team, his cheerleader girlfriend, to the lonely outcast. It is not afraid to deal with real serious issues that teens face such as peer pressure, binge drinking, casual sex, cutting, and suicide.Faith is a major part of the movie and the transformation of the life of the main character, and as a Christian I accept and believe that, but instead of focusing on the theology it illustrates the results of belief, loving and accepting others, inclusion, forgiveness and redemption."
1,language disappointment,We were very disappointed that this product does not appear to have choice of languages. We were looking forward to at least Spanish subtitles. It is useless for us.
5,"If you buy one movie today, buy THIS ONE","This is the first movie I have seen in a long time which actually inspried me!Excellent acting - and wondeful production skills. Really, I was impressed at suchan accurate portrayal of the problems youth face today.Whether or not you are a Christian, I think everyone needs to see this movie."
1,Was everything truly neccessary?,"Seriously. Was everything here neccessary? The language, bed room scene (not too explicit- Jake takes off shirt and they lay on the bed and he's shown getting dressed again- but did it have to be there at all?), & drinking? Sure teens face that stuff in life. But did it have to be put in a film that could have honored Christ more than it does? It would have been okay if these issues had been discussed in the film, but did they have to be shown? Plus, the preacher and his son are two of ""the bad guys"" here. Why is that?Other than this, the film was fine. Sadly, what I mentioned above pretty much ruined the movie for me. But if none of that bothers you or you don't mind showing that to your youth group, go for it. I just thought I'd throw this review out there in case there's someone like me looking for this angle on the movie."
3,"Honest Teen Drama--No Fluff, No Cheese","I was pleasantly surprised. This film is good. It's not cheesy like some Christian dramas tend to be. It doesn't flippantly toss out quick-fix, easy formula answers. There's no fluff here. It is real. In fact, at one point, I wondered, ""Are teenagers really this mean to each other?"" If so, high school in America is a tough & difficult minefield. Jake taylor grows a conscience, and comes to recognize his own shortcomings in the way he treats people, and in other issues he faces. He decides to change and make a difference for good. To Save a Life deals honestly and realistically with teenage issues like suicide, divorce, cutting, bullying, drinking, peer pressure, and friendship. This film is a great catalyst to get teenagers talking about issues they are confronted with. Every teenager in America should watch this film, and participate in a discussion about it afterward. Recommended."
5,Kick assness,"This Review is so like cool it's unbelievable so you have to buy it because it rocks. So go and buy and and I promise that you will listen to it forever, constantly, (unless you don't have a CD player, or any ears...or hands?)SO yeah this album kicks major ass, except not your...Well, whatever *Squall pout* turns you on^.^"
4,J.D.Robb Fan,I started reading the In Death Series about a year ago and I enjoyed the first one I read Naked in Death so much that I soon was searching for more of the series I read Betrayal in death and I liked it as well.I look forward to reading the whole series.
1,hole in product,"This shirt arrived with a big hole in one of the side seams. Because I haven't had time to repair it, my daughter hasn't gotten to wear it. I would have sent it back, but that costs more than to just keep it and repair it myself, however I am not happy about spending money on damaged merchandise."
1,digital camera,"This camera broke after 30days.the flash refused to work even after changing batteries, changing battery brands..."
4,Cheesy but fun sci-fi film with great effects for the time.,"This film offers a mixed bag for sci-fi and old film buffs. George Pal created lavish sets and excellent special effects, and added carboard actors and a script that will make you wince at times. However, there is enough spectacle to make up for the bad dialog. The House of Pain, where slaves become beasts (long before Michael York found the Island of Dr. Moreau). Deadly Crystal Weapons. And of course, the destruction of Atlantis. Movie trivia buffs might recognize the final moments of Atlantis - they were reused in a later Tony Randall film! (I am Lo-the to say which one.) Great fun, if not a great movie. END"
3,searching for a new methodology,"Braxton had finished with his great quartet of the 70's a few years earlier that included George Lewis, but had not created his next great quartet with Crispell, Dresser, and Hemingway. So this quartet has a mix of old and new faces. Hemingway would be Braxton's drummer for a decade after this. Lewis was back for one last hurrah with Braxton. Unfortunately, there is no hurrah here. The opener, Comp. 105A meanders for almost twenty minutes. Lewis always sounded like he ought to be hanging off of a tailgate playing funeral marches in New Orleans: it is his soloing that is the most impressive here, above that of the leader. The range of slurs and growls Lewis creates is astonishing. Lindberg is fine in support. At times on each of the tunes, you have the impression that everyone is waiting for something to happen instead of creating an event. An average effort."
5,Totally original!,If you're into unique sounding music this album is for you. It's quirky textures and cartoonish quality are sure to please.
1,junk,"these gloves rip easily and it feels like youre wearing a mitten on your hand. mobility is very limited, does not feel natural or comfortable"
3,This could be incredible if not for Antonio!,"I love Maury Yeston's music. Chita Rivera, Jane Krakowski, and (I wasshocked!) Mary Stuart Masterson were amazing!!! I just think that AntonioBanderas is so overrated. He has a decent voice but his diction is soterrible that you miss some of Yeston's brilliant lyrics. I have not seenhis performance, so maybe there is something more in seeing him play therole, but his recorded voice is not at all impressive. (And I felt the sameway watching him perform on the Tony Award broadcast...surrounded by amazingmusical theatre performers and he just isn't that great!) Don't buy it forAntonio...buy it for Krakowski's incredible ""Call From the Vatican"" orMasterson's ""My Husband Makes Movies"" or Laura Benanti's lovely ""UnusualWay""...or any time Chita opens her mouth!"
4,"Good, but lacking a little energy","""Eve of Destruction"" lacks the force of the original by Barry McGuire"
3,Ending was too neat,"The book has a great storyline, but it seems as if Jon's problems are all gift-wrapped into a happy ending. All the conflict he faces seem to be resolved quite simply. Too bad in real life it's not that way. Being an African-American gay male is much more complicated than just going out, having fun and sleeping with different men. It is a constant struggle for acceptance in two worlds: the world of the African-American male and the world of the gay male. It seems to this reader that some of that was a bit too simple, and didn't bring enough issues to the table. But the book was engrossing and a constant read. I found myself wanting to know how Jon would deal with his conflicts, so I couldn't put the book down. But just when it started to get good-- it ended. Exploring Jon as a character more thoroughly would have produced greater satisfaction for the reader. Keep up the good work!"
1,Eight Easy Steps Remies,"The remixes on this record pretty much all sound the same. Which wouldn't be so bad if they were all really good...but they aren't. The only one that stands out to me is the (Jez Colin Flipper Dalton Remix DJ Version). If you're a fan of the song ""Eight Easy Steps"" buy the ""Out Is Through"" IMPORT CD single that features ""Eight Easy Steps (Acoustic Vancouver) version. She breathes new life into the song and makes it sound really different much like a remix but better than ANY of these. If you just want to hear a good Alanis remix purchase one of the ""So Pure"" IMPORT CD singles. Those remixes are much better!"
4,erudite. I have not seen the book yet.,See review in Computational Linguistics vol 25 no 3 pages 445-6. The star rating is only given because Amazon's software won't accept a subission without one.
4,mst3k vol. 6.,the disc was in excellant condition and played without a problem. i am very satisfied with this disc. all a all a good purchase
3,nostalgia for the seventies,"Bringing back the mood of the seventies represents the only value of this movie-set. In this respect the editor's choice is OK.To those who were around back then: just watch, remember old times, and wonder how much the world has changed. To those who weren't: don't spend your money on these eight lousy movies."
1,Save your money,"Having just seen these disks, I am amused at the reviewers (employees of the company??) who laud its value...you know like 8 movies for 'x' amount. Well, garbage in garbage out. I was so irritated by the poor quality that I write this at 2:10am, eschewing sleep to warn others.This is a collection of crap that they swept up off the film library floor. There might have been one 'titillating scene' and -0- humorous or dramatic ones. The quality of everything was poor; these weren't B films but F,G, or Z films. The production cost of the films, after they picked them up at the Kodak booth at Walgreen's, must have been at least $600, including the camera rental.People forget that the old funny, 'camp' films were intended as such...i.e. comedies. Batman, Ed Wood...noone thought they were dramas even at the time. Instead of buying this 'value' pack, save shipping and just take the money from your wallet and place it gingerly in the trash..."
2,Poor acting and Lame plots. Pretty boring too,"I had no idea about what 70's low budget 'drive in cult classics' were like. According to few other reviewers, this set is a good example of the genre. OK then, now I know. Since it is so low priced, perhaps good buy to see what those movies were like, for the record."
2,SUCKED!!,"I read the reviews on this title before buying it and they were all very good so I figured hey for 3.99 I will buy these slasher movies thinking that they would be old style blood bath type movies where teenagers are all getting killed at some point. I was wrong with that assumption, these movies show boobs but there is hardly any killing and when someone does die you don't know what the heck happened. Watching these movies is a waste of time, they aren't scary or interesting at all unless you just want to see girls take their tops off which I know some people do. I should have known that if they are giving your 8 movies for $4 that they are probably terrible movies, but again I went by the reviews so I must say that if you want boobs; buy these. If you want slasher flicks KEEP LOOKING it's not here!!!"
5,Just what I expected!,"Although the movies vary in their quality, with eight films there should be something here for everyone. Sure they aren't great films by any means, but they provide just enough entertainment to keep you satisfied. The films are perfect for a romantic at home date with someone you care for. Just make sure to have a crapload of popcorn on hand, it's gonna be a long night."
1,"8 for the price of one is good, but quality is bad","I loved being able to nostalgisize (my own word) by watching these, but the video quality seems no better than a vhs tape (or maybe worse.) Detail is poor, shadows are empty of content, etc. Upconverting dvd players don't really help much with this dvd."
4,DRIVE IN CULT CLASSICS,"Worth every penny.The quality is what you would expect from films of that era,some better than others but I enjoyed watching them. Some of the story lines are very weak and just a reason to show some skin.I would buy again and the skin you see is worth it.Nice to see some natural boobs for a change."
2,classics? i don't think so.,"I was seriously disappointed in this package. 8 movies for $10 list price is a bargain, but who wants to spend 12 hours watching this garbage? In all honesty, some of these films were so bad that I watched mostly in fast forward mode (particularly the Pick Up, which seemed to require the use of some mind-altering substance to understand). I suffered through the entirety of half of them, though, and none of those were particularly interesting in either a good or bad way. There is some bad dialog and acting that's laugh inducing here and there (particularly in Cindy & Donna and Malibu High), but for the most part these movies seem to exist for only one purpose: to provide soft-core fodder for men. Thus you get to see topless young women (most of whom aren't pariticularly attractive) in every film and lots of rolling-around kissing scenes. If that sort of thing is your bag, then you might like these movies. I just found them tedious."
5,very good,"My granparents imagrated to this country 1912 and first settled in Utica. I bought the book hoping it might learn little more about their ealy years. This book delivered. I could not put it down, it was full of history."
4,Better and better,"For fans of Dexter this is a must see. This series just keeps getting better and better. I for one do not have Showtime and must wait for the release of the series on DVD and I must admit it was worth the wait.My minus one star is not directed at the content of the show but more at Showtime or even it's parent company: Paramount for making disc five unreadable in some machines AGAIN, just like last year's series. In order to see the last episode in my house, everyone has to move to the office to see it at the computer. I guess having a Blue-ray doesn't mean it can read it all."
1,DO NOT BUY SHOWTIME DVD,"I saw the REAL series on Showtime. I always get the DVD after the series has ended. I have never been disappointed in the Showtime releases of Dexter until now. They edited the original so badly that the continuity between shows has been lost. This is a SIN!!!! They have sacrificed one of their best shows in favor of mindless advertisement for other less popular programs. If you can acquire Amazon streaming episodes of Season 5 that have not been cut, then that is what you should do. Showtime should re-release an uncut version of this DVD and try to recover their reputation. I am saving my Season 6 on DVR because I do not trust Showtime to do a decent job any longer."
3,"Love this show, but this season was a total let down","Seasons 1-3 were worthy of 6 stars. Season 4 dwindled. Season 5 was a total let down. Dexter lost drive to be a ""neat monster."" And I hate Julia Styles"
3,dexter,"great thing, buying and watching episodes..it just doesnt stream as good as it should..thanks..ill be watching more anyway, im sure"
4,If you love Dexter,Dexter is fantastic... it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Each season is different and has a little something to keep you watching. Two thumbs up!
2,Dexter review,"One must have a certain bent in order to appreciate Dexter. I admit I don't have it. Though series five did leave me with the chills and I found it suspenseful and horrifying, the butchery is too well done and all in all it is truly repugnant. I can't subscribe to the lovable Robin Hood serial killer theme. It is not going to be a classic in my book for sure. And the acting is flat. Dexter lacks a depth and intensity, and that is frightening. A true picture of a sociopath. Thanks for teaching our kids about violence."
2,too much flower,"being an avid historian i was somewhat disappointed with this book. parts were truely exciting but on the whole a la mozart, ""too many words."" appears to be written by a frustrated english major using a history subject. tell me facts and details, skip the flowery prose."
1,Order Cancelled automatically without any reason given,"I really havent got the order i placed for the luggage, hence i cannot say on the quality of luggage set. However I just received an email from amazon that this order has been cancelled. When i called amazon help desk, they asked me to contact the actual vendor. I called them up, but it seems they are not 24x7. I need to to go out for shopping luggage again. It's really not been a pleasant experience."
5,A Precious Jewel,"The Heritage Hall Jazz Band is an ad-hoc unit composed of some of the finest musicians ever to play New Orleans Jazz. An excellent program of traditional and new Christmas Music. Outstanding solos and ensemble work by true masters of the genre. I would gladly have paid many times the price of this classic.Gregg Stafford (tp.), David Grillier (cl.), Fred Lonzo (Tb.), Narvin Kimball (Bj.), Sam Mooney (g.), Richard Payne (b.), Herlin Riley, Ernie Ely (d.), Ricky Monie (p.)This is a roster of stars!!"
1,Isn't he Canadian?,"Shouldn't he be a little more worried about the situation in Canada? If he is now a self-proclaimed ""American"" doesn't that mean he abandoned his birth nation?"
1,Sorry Neil...but,"We don't need overly jingoistic political rhetoric at a time when what the world needs is globalised, humanised thinking.If you wanted to do something good, go to the front line in Afghanistan or Iraq and work for the Red Cross. Spare us the self righteous grunge rock rubbish that is ""Living With War"".Look to your contemporary, Paul Simon on how to grow old with grace."
1,Rate the Music - not the Politics,"I heard Neil Young sing about eight of the ten tracks on this CD at a recent concert with Crosy, Stills and Nash. The sound was so-so. I then bought this CD thinking I would hear a better sound. I was wrong.The CD reveals more clearly that Young's voice has lost most of his range. His voice is tucked deep into the sound mix of this CD to try to hide the fact he no longer has much vocal range. The background vocals on the CD are much inferior to what Crosby, Stills and Nash provided on stage (they are not on this CD). His guitar playing is mostly uneventful - even boring. The addition of the large backing choir provides little to the overall sound mix.If you want a political protest CD, buy all means buy this. But if your looking good music, caveat emptor. This CD has been heavily discounted for a reason."
4,The True Patriot,"Some have castigated Neil for being a Canadian telling us what to do - jeez the US Government never hesitates to tell everyone else what to do so this objection makes no sense. Musically its not Neil at his best, but politically speaking, rousing risk taking and damn fine lyrics, he's right out there. This isn't an album for the ages, but it is an album for right here and now. Would that other musicians would be so brave."
5,Relevant Man,"So few artists over 50 are stll making music that keeps up with the times. So many are relying on their past to tour and make money. This is fine and we all enjoy reliving our youth now and then. Neil Young is different. He is as relevant now with songs like Living With War and the Restless Consumer as he was back in the day with Ohio and Southern Man. I won't bore you with which songs I think are the best as that is all to one's own taste. However, I will say this album sounds more like Crazy Horse than not. I've admired this man for many years and that is still evident. He is truly a serious, to be listened to artist."
1,Neil Follows The Pack,"No intelligent dialogue or commentary here. Just Neil kowtowing to the Bush-haters of the world. Neil can churn out generic drivel like this as much as he wants and apparently there will always be an audience for it. Add some hatred of The President to the mix and he'll sell another couple hundred thousand cd's and go up by 2 or 3 stars in Rolling Stone and here on Amazon. It doesn't change the fact that, despite the knee-jerk rhetoric, it's horrendously bad art. Hatred on a silver disc in a cheap brown wrapper. I agree with the other reviewer that Young should be ashamed of himself. It's funny what some people consider praiseworthy. You and Neil deserve each other."
1,disappointed,"I'm a huge Neil Young fan which is why I'm so disappointed with this album. The people who love it seem to share one thing in common: a visceral, even irrational, hatred of George Bush, rather than an appreciation of Neil Young. You know, I'm not a Christian but I think Bob Dylan's Slow Train Coming is one of his best albums. The point is that if the music is good, it shouldn't make any difference what the words are, and the music here is simply not up to snuff, not up to Neil's standards. The music here is not that good and the lyrics are, well, childish and naive, rather than childlike. real Neal Young fans, as opposed to George Bush haters will know the difference."
5,Awesome,"The problem is America has never been very good at listening too uncomfortable truths and Neil Young has done this with vengeance on this AWESOME album. Having just watched the documentary of C,S,N & Y taking this album on the road and the varied receptions they received in various cities, Held me spellbound and the soundtrack was perfect.Many Americans hide behind the 'we are fighting a war on terror' tag line, Well the UK fought a 30 year ""war on terror' in Northern Ireland and what was the American response, 1)The main fund raisers for these murderers and 2)Refusing to extradite IRA murderers. But hey the Catholic vote is far more important than a few thousand Brits and Irish being murdered.Many of the participants in the documentary prove that you can love your country but still question your government when you think it's wrong.Just buy this album it's brilliant and as any piece of art is supposed to do it provokes thought and discussion."
5,Great song and nice music,I myself am not the bigest fan of 'My sweet lord' however I like all of George Harrisons music. If you don't know if you like his music or not I would get some of the Beatles albums that have songs on them like 'Taxman' or 'I Me Mine' however everyone should get 'My Sweet Lord' because its a good song and a great beat to it. I think its a very nice song!
4,New approach in Watercolour,"An excellent variation on watercolour technique. Very well explained and filmed. Avoids the ""same as usual"" treatment for water and pigments.Strongly recommended."
3,Keeps You Engaged,"3.5 stars. Engaging, multiple interwoven mysteries involving fire and fire fighters, abduction, complex relationships and murder. Like many convoluted mysteries there is a plethora of coincidences, for me a common plot contrivance that grows irksome (when taken to extremes like here) as storylines converge and neatly resolve. Regardless, I very much enjoyed the read, though the writing itslef is not exceptional."
4,enjoyable,"I've read several books by this author and have enjoyed every one. They provide pleasant, light entertainment . My only quibble is with the plethora of characters the author includes. In the ""Dark House"" book I counted 30 characters introduced in about the first 30 pages. I had to take notes to keep everybody straight. As the story progressed a few others joined the crowd on top of it all. Crombie's other books seem to be character-heavy also. Other than this nuisance, I really like her books and will no doubt read more, while keeping note pad handy."
3,good book for the working couple/family,"Will all the ""fanfare"" about Ian Dunbar I was expecting great things from this book but instead was disappointed. It is a good book for the ""working outside of the home couple/family"" but not for someone looking to devote their days to raising an intelligent, loving companion.This book to me, did not read easily and I didn't not agree with many suggestions in it. If you are looking for an easy-to-read, wonderful, funny, well-written, detailed puppy training book, get Mother Knows Best by Carol Lea Benjamin."
1,Not as advertised,"I received only one 4 pack of candle refills, not the 40 that were advertised. The company I ordered from would not honor the advertised amount nor did the supervisor of customer service return my call as requested. I did receive a refund, but I would have expected the order to be honored as advertised. The company blamed the error on Amazon."
4,great album! not the best DM album.,"it seems a lot of fans didn't like the change in sound on Exciter. i love it! i think this album is very solid, though not quite as good as Ultra, Violator or Songs of Faith & Devotion (my favorites).there are a variety of songs on here, but the production throughout the album is very consistent. though, i wonder if maybe it's too consistent. the album is almost hypnotizing. as some other reviews have mentioned, the title is sort of misleading because it's not really exciting. however, it is a great album to make love to. so, maybe that's what the title refers to. many of the tracks are rather mellow, and while there are a handful of upbeat tracks, the overall feel is very laid back. it's the perfect album for chilling out on a summer evening or to put your moves on."
2,Dissappointed,"Ever since the ""Violator"" release, I have been dissappointed in each new Depeche Mode CD. All of their music seems to be a rehash of their more successful tunes. The rhythms and melodies on Exciter I've heard before on other Depeche Mode CDs. Violator was Depeche Modes acme, they seem to be out of fresh Ideas. Its a shame but it happens."
5,personal mode,"great cd depeche mode never disappoints with there heart felt electro/synth music, shine is a strong balled full of emotion but i love all there music and always will"
4,it grows on you!,"Before you listen to this CD, you have to throw all your expectations out the window. The music on this CD is very different from their previous stuff. A lot of it is slow. Many tracks do not have catchy and accessible melodies. In fact, most people will probably hate this CD at first as I did. But you have to give it a chance and listen to it with an open mind. The fast tracks have rough, powerful energy, while the slow tracks are very relaxing. This CD will certainly divide the listeners. Some will call it a masterpiece; some will hate it. I guess the truth lies somewhere in the middle."
2,Never let me down??,"The 4th of April was a great day for me because I heard that Depeche Mode were releasing an album called 'Exciter' on the 15th of May. Ultimately the album offered little. The mood created by the songs is a stark contrast to that suggested by the album's name. Now, I've been a DM fan for a long time, and I've loved almost everything they've put out. This time though, I had trouble liking most of the tunes they came up with. Sometimes you'll listen to a song for the first time and not like it. But then, if you hear it a couple of times, it starts to grow on you. No such luck this time. Sorry DM."
4,Excellent,"While certainly not the best Depeche Mode album, this is the finest release the guys have made in years. It certianly supercedes ""Ultra"" in my opinion. While slow at times, this moody and more mature sound is to be expected from a band that has just turned 20. I compare it to SOFAD in the sense that the album grew on me. After hearing DM in concert, this album meant a whole lot more to me. While certainly not ""Violator"" this is one of the Mode's better releases. And even if you dont like CD, see the tour, they play a lot of great early 90s and late 80s stuff."
5,Great CD!,"What a great cd from Depeche Mode! Who could expect any less? This has to be one of their best albums in the last 10 years. The songs that stand out are the opening track ""Dream On"" with a bit of ""Personal Jesus"" in it. ""Shine"" is just a great ballad track, ""The Dead of Night"" is a hard industral song, while ""Good Night Lovers"" is a whispered love track, but the song that stands out the most is ""Freelove"" which is up there with ""Enjoy the Silence"" it has the same kind of feel to it. This is a fabulous cd and it takes from all the musical ideas made over the years and puts them into one great album, This is a must have for any music lover, Depeche Mode fan or not."
2,Just Blew 14 bucks - I DON'T Feel Love,"Congratulations, ..., you can pick up your check and backstage passes, your career as a flack is fully intact. Folks, don't believe the hype on this one. I've been a fan of Depeche for years, and if you buy this CD expecting an up tempo, synth pop, i.e. fun album, like Black Celebration, People are People and Violator - Dream On. With the exception of the first two singles - Dream On and I Feel Loved, Exciter is boring, boring, boring. Lyrically it's as weak as anything they've done - I defy anyone to listen to Breathe without laughing. And Dead of Night? I thought that Rage Against the Machine experiment we had with Songs of Faith and Devotion was over. It seems that in their attempts to remain ""relevant"" Depeche has completely abandoned the sound that helped build such a loyal following."
3,Not to Shabby,"I think this album is pretty decent, DM is trying to take us for a ride in diffrent direction and I think some of us weren't quite ready. I was actually hoping for Ultra part 2. Dream On is a perfect single to introduce us to their new sound, my problem is a few of the songs sound similiar and a bit boring, but then you listen to songs like the catchy I feel loved and the beautiful Free love-( which by the way should be their next single) that you can't help but think they are back. This cd is worth having in your record collection but I am already anticipating the next Depeche Mode Album:)"
3,Not sure...,"I'm still not sure what to make of this CD. Like others, I have enjoyed listening to Depeche Mode for years, and was quite ""excited"" after discovering they were releasing another CD. After listening to it several times, however, I still can't quite decide whether I like this CD or not.Just as everyone else has stated, the CD is quite different from most of Depeche Mode's earlier works. It's a bit more balanced than Ultra, which had some catchy tunes and a few touching songs sung by Martin Gore. However, while the new CD is more balanced by comparison, it doesn't contain any real memorable songs. I long for the days of Music for the Masses and Violator (and their previous works), where you could actually sing along to most of the songs. Their new album, however, lacks the strength off their previous works, and you'll be lucky to even remember the words, let alone sing along..."
5,"Not Violator, But Excellent , Nice Change from DM","THis album is different from the previous depeche mode albums, but i agree with some of the previous reviewers, if you listen to it and get used to it and realize all the beautiful arrangements of instruments, i thought it was great. I think the lyrics are very good.All the people who gave this album 1 star are trying to sabotage the real depeche mode fans reviews and ratings. You can't honestly tell me this cd isn't better than 98% of everything other artists put out. These guys have been around for a long time, give them some credit. The concerts are excellent!!Personal faves are Shine, Comatose, Freelove. Give this CD a listen, you won't be disapointed if you love Depeche Mode or similiar groups like THe Cure, The Smiths, etc..."
1,Worst DM Album,"I am a huge DM fan. I have all of their albums and love ""Violator"", ""Black Celebration"" and ""Some Great Reward"". However, it's apparent that Alan Wilder was such an important part to the music that DM's last two albums are failures. ULTRA has it's moments, but Exiter has none. ""I Feel Loved"" sounds like a B-side to earlier DM singles. The rest of the album is was too personal and dry to listen to more than once. ""Dream On"" was the strongest song on the album? Yikes! (I don't want to fall asleep listening to DM, but this album does the trick) The last DM album I consider to be worthwhile is ""Songs Of Faith And Devotion"". Exciter is a huge disappointment from a band that seems to be directionless without Wilder. Martin should have publically recognized his contributions and not shut him out. Too bad..."
2,c'mon people...,"people, this is a boring album, and yes, I love DM. They can do better than that....I don't like it when big time DM fans automatically give every DM release a full mark without distingusihing between the different albums. They are hardly all one one level. Okay, so some are better than others. This page is intended for you (the persons who know best about DM) to review albums to give people who are not so familiar with their work an idea about their albums and their music. I don't have a problem with the fact that you give an album (which in my opinion is weak) five points but please be a bit more precise in the future. This is not supposed to be a meeting point for members of a DM fanclub....."
1,I hate this cd,"I can't stand listening to this cd. Think of the potential, and they released this. If they don't want to make ""innovative"" material anymore or use synths, I say quit! Leave the legacy intact!"
2,Relatively poor,Exciter just seems to loll about at a languid pace and is near sleep inducing at best. There are some good songs but overall the effect is that it isn't all that great. Buy this only if you really want to or have to
1,Are they serious?,"Why did Depeche Mode release this? Were they desperate for cash? Was this a contractural obligation? Were they actually convinced that the songs on here were not crap? This album came out around the same time U2 shocked us all with the fantastic ""All that you can leave behind,"" and when Madonna released ""Music"". At least they showed us that '80s artists could still swing it with the rest of them. Depeche Mode should have been like them but for some reason, they released this dull drivel. Such a wasted opportunity to embrace new fans. The tour for this album was crap too. Oh well, at least they didn't go hip hop."
1,Definitely the worst DM release.,"The cd title should be ""Horrible"". I am a big fan of Depeche Mode but this release is a big dissapointment. The songs ""Dream On"", ""I Feel Love"" and ""I Am You"" are the only tracks worth hearing in my opinion. I keep hearing all the talk of David Gahan's drug problem being a reason for bad work in the past. Well, with Exciter, I suggest you get back on the drugs if that's what it takes to produce good work!My amazement is that you can find many ""Exciter"" Bonus tracks on the internet that I haven't been able to find on the cd. And everyone of those Bonus Tracks is twice as good as what the group choose to put on their album. The guys definitely got the good and bad mixed up when deciding on which tracks to include with this release. Check out the bonus tracks on the net. If your a DM fan like me, you will probally be pleased with what you find. But don't bother with the Exciter release. Sorry Depeche Mode, hope you learned a lesson this time."
5,Beautiful & mature album,"I really do not know why so many Depeche Mode fans do not like this album. Yes, it is not ""Violator"" and no band not even our beloved Depeche Mode could duplicate their masterpiece recording. This album is a more mature yet still delightfully creative piece of art. Dave's singing is mature and the songwriting is still dark yet very romantic. This album at least lyrically and mood wise, feels much more personal and autobiographical. The reason I love Depeche Mode is their music has always grown and matured in different directions as the years pass. Each album has been musically and lyrically creative and special in it's own way. I believe Depeche Mode will be someday recognized along with Madonna in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Both are musical mavericks with the ability to reinvent themselves musically. The guys have come a long way from their first album."
5,Excellent!,"Depeche Mode are in the position where they can do everything they want, without having to worry about money, fans or anything. They can make an album full of slow, emotional songs - no radio hits, no clubbing hits. That's exactly what they did with Exciter - and still their album is heavily played on the radio and in the clubs! :)I'm very pleased with this record, although I was very suspicious after hearing the 30 sec. clips on DM.com. Depece Mode never did the love songs in this way - very emotional, slow and psychedelic songs with whispering vocals and without danceable beats (except I feel loved!). Dave really sounds wonderful!You may don't like the record, but you cannot deny the fact that Depeche Mode ARE one of the most innovative groups today. After 20+ years of their career, to make this kind of sound, without repeating themselves is unbelievable! Just give this album a try and you'll love it. :)"
3,Mildy disappointed,"I had not purchased a Depeche Mode album since ""Songs of Faith and Devotion"" and was really looking forward to buying ""Exciter"". Everything I read was how this was a 'return to form' for Depeche Mode. I was disappointed. I think this album will grow on me as I continue to listen, but this is not their best work. The intrumentation sounds too industrial for my tastes. The subject matter darker and gloomier than usual. They seem to really go after the ""gothic"" crowd on this one. There are definetly some highlights, like the first single ""Dream On"". Great song. ""Shine"" is also a very good song. This album reminds of the Depeche Mode of ""Black Celebration"", and I guess I was looking for the Depeche Mode of ""Violator"". You won't find that here."
1,Excite-not,"I cannot believe this album is averaging more than 3 stars!! This is the absolute worst DM album EVER. It is dull and badly produced. The music and lyrics have no appeal even after repeated listenings in failed hopes of it growing on me. If it did not have the DM name on it, I can guarantee it would not have gotten airplay or noticed even by those of you who gave it a ridiculous 5 stars. PLEASE people: do not rate bad albums with 4 or 5 stars just out of sympathy, or based on previous albums greatness... Rate the album on its own merits!! Other DM albums like Violator, Black Celebration deserve 4 and 5 stars. This one, I am sorry to say, is no comparison and deserves barely 1 star."
1,The real meaning of their song titles??,"I can't believe people actually gave this album four or five stars, as if it were the best thing since FREELOVE or something!! They must be COMATOSE?! DREAM ON if you think this is the innovative Depeche Mode that we know to SHINE on previous albums like Black Celebration or Violator. Ok, Ok, EASY TIGER, dont get me wrong, its not as bad as Ultra or Songs of Faith and Devotion, but WHEN THE BODY SPEAKS, it tells me these guys are getting as boring as THE DEAD OF NIGHT. The musical arrangement on most songs is embarrasing! And way too many songs have a LOVETHEME. What's up with that?! THE SWEETEST CONDITION would be to bring back old Alan Wilder... I'm sure he could BREATHE some life back into the struggling band. I FEEL LOVED that these guys continue making music for us, but after 3 failed attempts, they should really just call it quits and say GOODNIGHT LOVERS. I would not buy this album if I AM YOU."
2,Quite possibly the worst DM album after Alan left,"You started to see the decline in DM when Alan left after SOFAD. Ultra was ok at best, Exciter on the other hand is simply not worth listening to. There is not one song on this whole cd that is worth sitting down and listening to. If you believed that DM could prevail without Alan Wilder, listen to this CD and it will change your mind. This album lacks direction, and the fans are left thinking ""Is this the end of DM?"""
4,It's still growing on me...,"The first time I listened to this album it struck me as dull and monotonous. However, the more I listen to it, the more I love its nuances and subtle melodies and lyrics. The same phenomenon happened to me when I first bought ""Ultra"" also. It took a few months before I really got to appreciate that album because it was not, for the most part, catchy or immediately appealing. DM's greatest asset is their way to grow slowly on you, so that your favorite songs end up being the ones you originally skipped over. Exciter is sizing up to be another DM great."
2,B-Music,"Most of these songs belong on a B-side of an LP. Very little new ideas or emotion from DM. Almost as if they just put out an album of their jam sessions. Showed so little of the refined Depeche Mode lyrics or techno sounds that I am disappointed. Do nto get me wrong there are a couple of good songs on this album, but not an outstanding DM album.The 90's (Ultra, Songs of Faith and Devotion) and the new millineum (Exciter)has been unkind to the Fab Four of the Eighties. Maybe the next album will meet our expectations, I am not giving up. I hope the passion for music returns for Playing the Angel. Dave and Martin have been quoted as saying; ""It is better to be in Depeche Mode now, than in the past 15 years."" Now, if they could only get back Alan and his energy, the Fab Four would truly be back!!"
3,Uping the stars,"I feel bad for initially giving this album only 3 stars when, after listen ing to it multip;e times, I discovered that it is just as good as Ultra. It's a bit 'heavier' meaining that they've gotten rid of a their old dance stly for a new meloncholy sound. It's quite a good sound too but you have to be more open minded about their style change."
3,Just the samples sound bad.,"Only listened to the previews.Sounds pretty odd for DM. Sounds a little forced, like a band that has lost its creativity."
3,Mildly Exciting,"Exciter is Depeche Mode's first album in three years and it finds the band recording some of the most personal music of their careers. Songs like ""Comatose"", ""Breathe"", ""The Dead Of Night"", ""When The Body Speaks"" and ""I Feel Loved"" take on the various problems in lead singer's David Gahan's life from drug addiction to attempted suicide to his recovery. The music incorporates the classic Depeche Mode sound while updating it with some electronica sounds. While the album is a solid work, it doesn't measure up to their earlier albums and falls short in certain places."
1,Junk,"I love Depeche Mode. I like their great string arrangements, lyrics, productions, etc. This album however is .... I can't tell you how many ways it .... Totally uninspired. Junk. This is a case of a successful group that has lost their edge and even though this will sell very well, it's only because of who Depeche Mode is and not on the merits of this piece of .... Very very disappointing."
1,What a disappointment,"I have been a longtime DM fan and I was really looking forward to his album. I thought Ultra was an important album for them to make considering the amount of personal turmoil surrounding the band at that time. Dave's vocals were strong and althought some of the songs were not that catchy, they were songs.....Freestate, Home, Useless to name a few. Exciter is a 50 minute mix of minimalist electronica bleeps with no emotion or heart. The tempo is incredibly slow and I really have no intention of putting it in my CD player again. I really feel that they have taken two giant steps backwards with this recording and I'm worried about how they are going to pull off these songs live. If the tempo of the set is too slow, I predict many people heading for the Beer Stands. This after paying $.. for a ticket. I really hope they play a lot of old stuff. What a disappointing album."
2,Very Uninspired,"Depeche Mode is an outstanding band, this cannot be argued. Perhaps with the releases of ""Violator"" and ""Ultra"" we thought they were perfect. However, this belief was shot down with the release of ""Exciter."" I have tried and tried to get into this album, but have never been able to. It just seems bland and less than inspired, almost as if they were getting pressure from the label to turn out another CD. Like I said, great band, but this is not one of their better efforts, in my opinion."
4,Chick-Lit With a Twist!,"I'm always reading ""chick-lit"" books and one thing I really liked about The Way It Is was how it was different from most chick lit books. It had a mult-ethnic cast of characters (white, black, latino) and two of the main characters were plus-size women. Also, and thank God, it was not set in New York City (it takes place in D.C.).The Way It Is is a quick fun read and made me laugh out loud more than a book has in a long time....a great vacation read!"
2,OK IF YOU DON'T NEED PAYROLL SERVICE,"Though I received two free copies with some hardware, I will not be using Microsoft SBA because it's payroll services are really bad. If you want to get payroll taxes, etc. to do your employee's checks, you can sign up for a service, but the service is an online company for which data is EXCHANGED with SBA. Internet always required, multiple levels of passwords, what data is going out ? To avoid this you can find the tax rates yourself and use Excel to calculate payrolls and then EXCHANGE DATA with SBA. This takes about 4-5 times as much effort as Quickbooks' automatic DOWNLOADS and, if you go with the online company, costs three times as much as does Quickbooks' equivalent service. Too bad that SBA has this fatal flaw because I really liked the layout and feel of the program."
2,It's not what it seems,I was told it was the same as Quick books! but for a fration of the price!Theres no such thing as a good deal!The only way to get this work right is to buy the rest of the software and then im sure it would be fine but then your paying more than Quick Books..Its only a module!
3,good value,"I bought this for my start up business and did not want to spend the money on quickbooks. I haven't had any major problems with this program other than I was not able to create the ship to address to be different than my own address. (I am a distributor use blind tags on all of my transactions). Yahoo! solutions was helpful. You have to create a word document, then you can edit the ship to address in the word document. This has worked out just fine. I like the front page, it tells me all of my information( sales, outstanding balances, invoices due, open orders etc) right there without having to create several reports."
1,Horrible Accounting Software,This is one of the worst thought out small business accounting packages because transactions cannot be imported. It is useless for anyone switching from another program. Forget it.
5,Ends gloriously,"Probably not the best, taken as a whole, but no version of the soprano trio tops this one--and the last fourteen minutes of this opera are my very favorite minutes in musical history. Sonically, first rate."
3,Interesting ideas,"Despite the bizarre cover, the very poor writing and truly terrible editing - there are some very interesting ideas and research here. It is just presented and organized so very poorly. The title is perplexing, but the core of the work is truly thought-provoking. It is frustrating to read because of all of the structural and grammatical errors."
4,"Good, if dated history of AACA","This is a good overview of AACA and how it started. The photos are interesting, and I enjoyed looking through it. The content is somewhat dated, as the organization has changed a lot since it was published."
3,"Okay, but not the original.","Danny Davis' original 1970 Christmas album for RCA was a classic of its type, an eminently listenable mixture of country and easy-listening sounds. However, prospective buyers should be aware that this CD is *not* a reissue of that album.Whether due to licensing problems or out of a desire to exploit the cleaner sound of the digital medium, Davis went back into the studio in 1995 to make an all-new Christmas album for the Laserlight label. The tracklist is the same, as are the arrangements and possibly even some of the personnel; however, discerning listeners will easily distinguish these recordings from the 1970 originals (which have never been reissued on a commercial CD and can only be found through Danny Davis' own website).While the new recordings are certainly enjoyable (and, indeed, some listeners may actually prefer them to the originals), please be advised that it's with good reason this is titled ""The *New* Danny Davis & the Nashville Brass Christmas Album""."
5,A Great Romance Writer Turns to Mysteries,"Jill Marie is one of my favorite writers of historical romances and I'm thrilled she is writing contemporary mysteries. I loved Lover's Lane and was glad to see Kat Vargus back in another book. This is a great read and hard to put down like all of Jill Marie's books. Like the other reviewers, I liked the relationship between Ty and Sunny which is nicely done and more nuanced than most mysteries.If you like mysteries, try her earlier historical romance Jade. I'm not sure it's still in print but it's great too!A Reader from Asheville"
4,Really good!,"This book started out surprisingly well and is written VERY well. I cannot believe I let this book sit brand new on my shelf for over a year! Very quick read, less than 175 pages. Very nice change from the ""norm"". I'm not sure if it's intended to be a comedy or not, since some of the subject matter (rape, murder, explosions, etc.) is not funny, but the author has one hell of a humorous streak. One of the main characters, Fame - a wannabe comedian - is not my favorite, but please definitely notice him when you read this. :-) See if you don't imagine him as J.B. Smoove every time he opens his mouth.Good story, good characterization, sort of abrubt ending and a few unanswered questions, but well done."
4,Very good story......,"This was a very funny, explosive and thought provoking story. I agree with the previous reviews that it was a short story. The author wrote a detailed book until the last few chapters. It seemed rushed and could have been explored more. We never found out exactly why Nigel was searching for Wolf. What and why Nigel hid something in the Bahamas out island? What happened when Jean Paul was reunited with his friend and father? What happened when he revealed that he didn't want to marry Nikki? Did he ever become a writer? THERE WERE SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS!!!!!"
2,problem packaging,"Several of the apple jacks packages were opened... it was only the apple jacks, but still creates a mess in the box. Amazon gave me a credit for the opened ones without any hassle, but I will not order again because I see I am not the only one with this issue, so it must be the manufacturer or something."
4,C Lanes square dance today,Wanted to see if I had any memory of Square dancing. This is very basic but nicely done.
3,"Great shampoo, didn't ship well",My husband and I love this shampoo. It smells really good and my hair was smooth and clean. We did however receive a broken pump so its hard to get the shampoo out of the bottle. I'm not sure if the box was dropped many times before we received it.
5,yummy!,Best shampoo ever! The shampoo I hoard and dole out in tiny sample bottles so the rest of the family doesn't use it all up. Smells and feels awesome!
5,Review of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo,"I had ordered and paid for TWO bottles, and at first, I was only sent one bottle. I contacted the person who sent me the shampoo, and at first I was asked to let them know what the number of the box was that the shampoo was sent in......when I was able to confirm that, they sent my the second bottle. So I was disappointed in the supplier."
1,AWFUL Product! Absolutely HORRIBLE!!,"Want DRY, brittle hair that feels like straw?Use this!I couldn't figure out why my once shiny, silky hair was feeling like straw and the ends were splitting.It was this shampoo, which is full of SULFATES!YUCK!Worthless!"
1,Dumbbell Rack,The weights recommended do not fit the rack. What a mistake! Now it is going to cost us more to send it back! Very disappointed and will not buy from them again.
3,Check out Jennifer's 1st band Soul Miners Daughter,Great band though Jennifer left the band after her bandmade Corey Jones was diagnosed with cancer.
4,"Jennifer Nettles past, present and (hopefully) future","As a long time Jennifer Nettles fan, (think Soul Miner's Daughter, and Jennifer Nettles Band) I was a bit disappointed with this CD. Let me start off my saying I love her voice and her energy, but having heard her live since 1997 I'm disappointed in the studio release of this CD. They over-emphasize her ""country-twang."" Seeing the live shows of Sugerland is definately better than the studio released CD for two reasons a) Jennifer's energy rocks and b) they can't enhance her voice. I'm all for branching out musically and I will say that I purchased this CD and do enjoy listening to it. However, having heard what she's capable of, (I mean I even had the chance to witness her rap during one concert!) all I'll say is that I look forward to seeing what Jennifer will do in the future."
3,new three some group,A good ALBUM BUT NOT EXCEPTIONAL as they sound like the other country musicians plying their trade......need to step up and come out with original lyrics if they are to survive their second album
4,"It helps, but it won't solve it all","I think this pan is overpriced. I got it with prime a year ago or so and expected more durable plastic. It's just regular plastic with different dimensions. It will help the splatter. However, it's not as sturdy as some claim."
5,YOU MUST SEE THEM LIVE!!!,"Probably their strongest album, almost every song got airplay. RICK NIELSEN KICKS ASS! Cheap Trick puts on a FANTASTIC live show. Spring for the front row seats, they're worth it!"
1,"Bad acting, unlikable good guys","I can't help but wonder if some of the reviews here were written by people involved with the production of this movie, or their mothers. Either that, or they saw a different movie than I did. The acting in this movie was terrible--except for a good job by Michael Madsen. The ""good"" characters were so unlikable, and played so poorly that I almost was on the side of the psycho guy. There's a lot of running around in an empty building, a lot of gore, and not much of a plot. I did watch to the end of the film, expecting an explanation, which when it came was pretty lame. Don't waste your time."
5,A delightful compendium from our city&#65533;s best tour guide,"Rare is the architectural guidebook that merges intricate depictions of the masterpieces with compelling tales about how they came to be. Yet that is precisely what Mr. Morrone has accomplished with this tome, which shows off a borough he clearly loves to great effect. This is a book you can, and should, hold in your hands as you walk through the neighborhoods Mr. Morrone has chosen to include. He made me love Brooklyn even more than I thought possible, and made me wish I lived both in this era and some many years ago, when the many buildings and neighborhoods he describes were coming into being. A must-have book for anyone who intends to look at the buildings of Brooklyn, whether for scholarly pursuits or for pure weekend pleasure."
5,Perfect,"I have been so happy with this addition to my remodeled bathroom. Sounds silly, but it makes a statement. My friends have commented on this and want to know where did I got it."
4,Good movies,"Three great movies all in one collection for under $10 bucks! Flimsy case, but otherwise worth the price I paid."
2,Blue ray?,"Did the patent on blue ray expire, and now anyone makes them at a half assed quality? I have many Blue ray video's, and this wasnt even close.... Great movies though, except for when Alexander bangs dudes... Was that necessary?"
5,Awesome.,"Frickin' awesome! 300, Troy and Alexander all on one Blu-ray... How could this ever be a bad thing? (It can't be)"
3,fun to watch,"My wife and I enjoyed it, the acting was good and th estory line went pretty smooth. We would have liked to see a little more erotic action."
5,Another masterpiece!,"After reading K.N.'s first book (Daughter of Dragons), I didn't think I'd find one I'd like better.... but she did it. Human Thing brings out the ""fighter"" in all of us, and reminds us about what our identity is really all about. Another ""can't put it down"" read, which I encourage anyone to pick up --> not just sci-fi lovers. You'll love Jillian as much as the rest of us have!"
1,Bad experience,"I bought this kitchen utensils set.. and I am sorry to say it is just usable not good one like they had shown.. I saw many utensils set with same number of item atleast 500% times better than what I got in less price.Second thing, I wanted to cancle the order immidiately but I tried to find out the customer care no on the amazon site.. but I could not find one :o((any way thats why I have decided not to buy from this site anymore...as now I can't rely on the pics only..."
2,Blogging is so Beta tape,"Hugh had a good idea here, but it was idea that was quickly surpassed by tweeting. Blogging had the potential of becoming a bigger deal in our social lives, but it was quickly surpassed by another innovation. Hewitt was at the edge of the innovation in blogging, so far on the edge that he missed the fact that it was open to being challenged by another technology. I give him kudos for being on the edge of things, and writing well. However, this book sadly is too far out of date to be of use any longer."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased BLOG with the hope that I would learn more about blogging, something I know very little about. While Hewitt is an enthusiastic cheerleader for blogging, he provides very little practical or detailed information about blogging. As other reviewers have mentioned, I found his stories and writing style arrogant and painfully redundant. I would recommend the book only for individuals who would like to know more about the origin of political blogs, specifically conservative blogs."
3,"Not bad, but I wouldn't have spent the money if I had known the author.","I bought this through a book club, and wish I had looked up the author first. If you can get past the NeoCon slams at Michael Moore and Al Franken, Hewitt makes a couple of good points. Not good enough to overshadow his attitude, but definitely relevant. Too bad he didn't show a little restraint - this might have been a good resource for those seeking to learn about blogs, but as it is, I can't really recommend it.One thing it did confirm for me, which I had long suspected, is that most conservative bloggers are paid writers or professional political operatives. While there are one or two of those on the Left of the political blogosphere, most of the Progressive Bloggers write on their own time and own dime."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"This book was a waste of my time and money. The author seems to be interested in only two things: 1) Patting himself on the back for his ""accomplishments"" and 2) Spewing as much right wing, conservative rhetoric as possible. There are many more good books on the market that discuss blogging, the Internet, etc. The author of this book seems more to be a mouthpiece for the far right wing Republican Party and big business. If you are open minded and don't like verbal bile spewing, don't buy this book."
1,Scientific ethics?,"Although, his candor is refreshing, his lack of ethics is pretty disappointing in someone of such great gifts. More depressing is how the scientific community, caught up in the moment, did not stop to really look at where the data came from and in Nature magazine's case, actually collaborated to hide the truth about ""Rosie's"" true contributions to Watson and Crick's success. They would not have won the race if not for her meticulous scientific research and one hundred hours spent developing the photo that led to Watson's aha! moment. Even if Franklin had been a man, the ethical lapse displayed by a Watson who looked down on being ""nice"" is damning to the basic character of the man and not good science. Because science relies on collaboration and the abilty to share ideas without fear of intellectual theft and worse, this kind of libeling of the dead that he performs throughout the book on Franklin. Perhaps his character assasination was the result of a guilty conscience."
3,Double Helix,a very exciting read with us in the USA and the overseas development and scientific research for the basic block to life - but not life itself. The model is correct but did not deliver the source to life as advertised.
4,Science Memoir,"I remember upon first reading The Double Helix I was delighted with the fact that Watson was a slacker and still managed to make one of the most important discoveries in biology. There was hope for me too! It is a pleasure to read a book about scientific discovery where the researchers are not mercilessly driven type-A personalities confined to their labs. A well-written account of the personalities and community behind a major scientific discovery, of the molding of disparate facts into a new theory that changed the field."
3,Detialed but not quite,"This book give lots of information on DNA and is detailed on the events that took place while workin in the lab in England. But it isn't detailed on how the came to there outcomes, its like they went to sleep, woke up, and knew the answer."
5,A Fine English Flying Fellow,"What makes Black Adder the most stunning of British comedies comes in season three. As the writers are ""literally"" running out of steam (you think), they surprise you with the following lines:""Disease and depravation are stalking the streets of London like two giant stalking things.""""I see the grave opening before me like a great big hole in the ground.""No other show has ever brought me to the edge of my seat like Black Adder - just to hear what strange and awful similes or metaphors will be parsed out!!Who can forget: ""That's about as effective as a cat flap on an elephant house.""Black Adder, to my ears, is the funniest show of all time if only for this line: ""You'd laugh at a Shakespeare Comedy.""Buy this, watch it, and laugh your elbow off!! (You'll get this later)"
3,Not so great,"I am usually a big fan of Rowan Atkinson, but I just am not a big fan of Black Adder. It does have it's funny moments, but it isn't my favorite British Comedy by any means."
4,how do you not love thomas,my 3 year old son just loves thomas to death. he couldn't wait to get the package open. the sheets are okay for childen but are not soft enough for adults.
1,"Paying for ""Thomas""","Yes, these are VERY crappy sheets. That said, I don't regret getting them. My son LOVES his Thomas sheets. He did earn them for completing his potty training, so I was held to the bargain of buying him ""Thomas sheets"". But I can't complain when I see how excited he gets when he talks about them. That alone was worth it.Decide for yourself."
5,Adorable and reasonably priced,"I'm pretty happy overall with all the webkinz. My eight year old daughter has been collecting them for about 1 1/2 years now. The online site is safe and she has a blast with them. My only complaint is that often I have to put a stich or two somewhere along the seam with quite a few of them. But for the price I can't complain too much. You get access to the site for a year whenever you purchase one. This gorilla is really cute too. By the way, if you're a parent, be forewarned; the site can be addictive for grownups too. Theres a lot of games, Quizzys is fun and there's a version of majhong that I've spent hours playing. These are definitely recommended."
4,Webkins are Wonderful,Webkins provides the children with an opportunity to expand their mind and learn a few basic computer techniques - and encourages them to want to learn more!
1,The Millionth Circle,"This is a nice book but if you are looking for information on starting a Circle, then it is a disappointing choice. I ordered it because of an interview I read in New Dimensions Journal where Justine Toms had a conversation with Dr. Bolen about Women's Circles. I found more helpful information in that interview than in the book, as well as information that was not in the book. What I have found that has proven helpful is the book Wisdon Circles. It has the information one needs to get a circle started."
4,With the old breed,This was a very good book. IT was well written with exellent detail from a participant. It was an excellent book. I had watched the Pacific and it was a great follow up to that. It made me rewatch some of the DVD after reading the book.
5,Simply the best personal account of warfare ever,I have read over 30 persoanl accounts of cambat in WWII and this one has to rank at the top. If anyone can read this account and not thank God for the USMC then they place no value in their freedom. The vivid accounts of sheer terror are beyond description. You must read it to believe it. I usually read about the war in Europe but after this book it is obvious that the fighting in the Pacific took brutality to another level. Thank you E.B. Sledge for your service and this wonderful book.
5,As good as they said it was,"I have generally found that it pays to read reviews before buying on Amazon; that's what makes this such a great community. So when I read nothing but rave reviews about ""The Old Breed"" I had to give the book a try.Wow.I have read many first-hand accounts of War II, and have interviewed many who were there. This book is indeed a rare jewel. Honest, well-researched, interesting... and hard to put down. Few books put you there- really there. This one does. Thoughtful, and with the right mix of pathos and resignation known only to a seasoned combat veteran. There is no way I could do the book justice in a review like this. A must read."
5,Incredible memoir,"Sledge was a young, sensitive man who joined the Marine Corp and saw some of the most viscious fighting in WWII. I have read many memoirs of war. This one stands alone as the best. Mr Sledge has the ability to make you feel his pain and terror and show how his experienc transformed him. If you want to see and feel what it was like to serve in the Pacific with the Marines read this book. I've given it to over 7 people as gifts (something I have never done before) and all found it very moving."
5,As an old Marine I LOVED this book,"This book is well written and shows the men who fought there clearly without adding Hollywood crap to ""spice up"" a novel.You will LOVE this book!"
5,with the old breed,This book will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will have trouble putting it down until finished.
5,Prayer of gratitude,"This is the best war memoir I have ever read. I was drawn to E.B. Sledge's ""voice"" during the viewing of Ken Burns' mesmerizing documentary on WW II. I checked his book out from the library in both audio and print version, listened to it all the way through, then read it. I wanted to loan it to my grandson (19) so I bought a copy. Grandson loved it too and son-in-law gets it next. I liked it for all the same reasons others have mentioned: Sledge's clear, direct style (one hesitates even to use the word ""style,"" the book flows so organically), his decency and courage, his honesty (he gives his ""worst of thoughts the worst of words""), his abhorrence of the necessity of this or any war. The desolation of knowing your government has deemed you ""expendable.""I wish I could have thanked this man. He passed away in 2001."
5,Gutted,"I watched much of The War this weekend on PBS. Ken Burns leans heavily on Eugene Sledge's account of war, and that tells me that Burns at least knows genius writing when he reads it.Sledge may be the best writer from the 20th century that most people have never heard of. His language is harrowing and detailed and does not spare any details about the chaos and misery and ineffable singular experience that is war. I truly believe that he lived through Peleliu and Okinawa, so he could compile his writings and share them with the world. How else can you explain the same person living through two of the nastiest battles of the 20th century?Buy this book. Share it with everyone you know."
4,Thanks to our Old Heros,"This incredible account, told with frank detachment, is hailed as the best World War II memoir of an enlisted man, and with good reason. Part adventure, part history, ""Sledgehammer"" not only relates many of the clichés every Hollywood movie depicted on the subject, but also everything they left out."
5,Muldoon's Techniques REALLY Work!,"I've tried many methods for achieving an OBE. After reading many authors, Muldoon's ""falling dream"" method is the only one that even came close to working for me. Also, I've experienced some of the OBE-related phenomena he describes, which further validates his writing for me. Although I have yet to have a ""full-fledged"" OBE, I've come closer practicing his methods than anything else! Highly recommended."
4,Buku klasik astral terbaik !!!,"Tahun 1929, buku ini dipublikasikan pertama kali dan masih di cetak ulang sampai saat ini. Muldoon, menciptakan teknik proyeksi astralnya sendiri karena saat itu belum ada referensi teknik astral yang tersedia secara luas. Dibuku ini Muldoon membahas tentang mimpi terbang, mimpi jatuh, tali astral (silver cord), pengaruh hasrat-kebiasaan-kebutuhan pada proyeksi astral, bahkan mengenalkan dua teknik ciptaannya : kontrol mimpi dan keinginan pasif. Muldoon adalah orang pertama yang mempublikasikan bahwa proyeksi astral bisa dimiliki orang biasa, tidak harus berbakat khusus. Muldoon menulis buku ini saat usia 25 tahun. Dia memperoleh pengalaman astral pertamanya usia 12 tahun, saat sedang sakit."
3,Not Quite What You Expected,"If you are going to buy one Isley Brothers album, don't make it this one as you will be disappointed. For example, their one song still receiving a lot of airplay after all these years, ""This Old Heart of Mine"", is an INSTRUMENTAL on this CD! From a vocal group!"
1,The worst mystery writer I've ever read,"I recently purchased this book by Ms. Clark, in an airport, deciding to finally discover what all the buzz was about. It is the first, and last, of her books which I will read, and I am most sorry I spent any money whatsoever doing so. The depth of the characterization is shallower than the thickness of the paper on which the letters describing the characters are written. One knows almost instantly 'whodunit', and why, and the remainder of the book is truly pulp fiction. One Tony Hillerman chapter has infinitely more depth, interest, and truthfulness than this entire attempt."
1,A Waste of Ink and Paper!!!,"I can't believe it! I bought the previous version of this book, for Flash 2 and found it practically useless. This book is almost identical to the previous version. It stinks!!! I can't believe Macromedia would put their name on it. You're better off learning off the web."
5,The Perfect Game,"If you are looking for the best in mortal kombat, look no further than ""mortal kombat - deception"" this game mixes advanced 3d kombat, with an adventure mode. the game also has bonuses like the ""puzzle kombat system"" which is a recreation of tetris, adding a new action packed twist. also featured is the ""chess kombat system, where players face mortal kombat on a chess board. truly an exiting AND stimulating game, MORE that worth the money it costs. engaging and thought provocative, THIS is the Perfect Game."
1,1 Star for this version 5 Star for the memories,"Why do they still do it? Colorize movies that is. I remembered this movie from my childhood days and loved it ever since. Occasionally seeing it on TV still gives me pleasure. I bought the DVD and only after getting it home I found out it has been colourized. It went back to the store for a refund immediately mainly for that reason. Another minor reason it is not widescreen. Poor judgement on Disney's part. I refuse to buy anything colourized. What would you do if they colourized ""It's a Wonderful Life or High Noon or Psycho"" Would you watch it? No one in their right mind would."
4,Hook lines and final exams and chart hits,"I am a professional musician, songwriter and music educator at South Plains College. We have used John's book for our songwriting classes every semester for the past nine years and found it timeless in it's concepts, fundamentals and philosophy. It has helped students understand how to put their creative talents to practical use, and helped them understand the beauty, soul and timeless importance of the wonderful art of songwriting. This week, February 13-19, four of our former students have songs in the Billboard Top 20 Country Music Charts. Success speaks for itself."
5,Very Helpful Book,"This book helped me gain useful techniques for vocablary learning. It also gave me good advice for using dictionary and organizing a vocabulary notebook. When you study with this book, you'll need a dictionary."
1,Totally Useless in Kindle Format,"Like another reviewer, I bought this book in Kindle format and find it to be TOTALLY useless.The Search function does not work at all. Finding something in it takes a horrendous amount of time, at best.If I thought I could get my money back, I would (and may try).There was NO warning that Searches could not be done. Shame on you for not putting that warning in the item description for the Kindle version."
1,Do not buy for kindle,I am sure the paperback is fine but the publisher should not offer this book on the Kindle as you cannot search it. The book has over 700 pages and does not have any useful search options.
5,Lots of food information.,"I'm on a point system diet and this book has all the information needed to calculate the points of foods, even organic products that I buy all the time. Going out to dinner? Calculate your food before you go! Fast food? I now know the food points of my favorite places. It's about the size of a good paperback novel so it's easy to carry around."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the book, not because of the content but because the Kindle version does not have certain tools enabled.I own an older version of this book and use it, but my husband bought me a Kindle for Christmas and I assumed I would be able to make the text larger and use the search tool to find specific items within the book. So I was very disappointed to find that neither tool was enabled for this book. Turning the Kindle to make the book wider only makes the print smaller, so that doesn't work either.Again, the content of this book is good and very helpful, but the Kindle version is a waste of time unless the reader has eagle eyes and enjoys flipping pages to find specific items."
4,Eugene Izzi was a genius crime fiction writer,"I am still so sad he is gone. I have read all of Eugene Izzi's books and the thought that there will be no more is tragic. I still think his best work is the early stuff, like The Take, Booster, King of Hustlers and the others. Eugene Izzi, you are missed."
3,i think thee book was very slow,i think the book had a good ending but a slow start so their for i was bored at the first couple chapters . the book had funny names and it had a good setting. but that book was written in the 1940`s. So i couldnt relate to this
1,It was a pretty boring book,The book was a pretty boring book. It was about cemeteries and I think cemeteries to me would be creepy and it also made fun of the dead. How they put facial expressions on them. And the title of the book should be something else because id someone hasn't read it before they would think it's a love story. Now that's my opinion of the book.
1,"One Thumb Down, No Thumbs Up","It's hard to give a review of this book. Personally I didn't like it. At the beginning before the book/strory starts, there is a Warning. The Warning states that in some parts it gets gruesome. It wasn't that bad but it did talk about dead bodies in the funeral home, and a persons death. I thought the plot of the story was pretty weird and dumb. I felt the characters didn't belong in that story. Its about cemeteries and then these weird characters come in and their problems don't have anything to do with the book. I'm not sure what the author was thinking about when he wrote this. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you want to waist your time and read something really strange. I say one thumb down no thumbs up because it had it's moments. But I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."
4,The American Way of Death Is About the Cheapening of Life,"In America, we tend to value an acquaintance mostly by his or her productivity or usefulness to us. We tend to compensate for that shortcoming subconciously by mounting extravagent retirement banquets and flowery, overwrought funerals full of ungenuine sentiment. But who says we can't love a person while they are still with us, and why can't we bother ourselves to appreciate our differences and to address them in a kindly and loving way before the end of our time together? Mr. Waugh, I think, says all this in ""The Loved One,"" but in a much more entertaining fashion. Indeed, you won't even realize it till you're done enjoying the book. I prefer the mainstream British Waugh of works like ""Brideshead"" or ""Decline and Fall,"" but Waugh shows he is perfectly comfortable with American material as well in this slim volume."
4,The Loved one was a story of love with a very ironic ending.,"This story was very hard on its characters especialy Mr. Dennis Barlow who lost his friend and his fiancee .Im not saying that he is the only one to be hit by tragedy inthe novel ,because Mr Joyboy also lost his fiancee who ironicly was also Dennis Barlows loved one.But then of course both of those guys get to live through the story while Miss Thanatogenos committs suicide all because she could not pick between two men to marry."
2,I felt that the story was very dull.,"In felt that the story was very boring and that I would lose interest in the book very fast. And the love triangle in the story between Denise, Amy and Mr. Joy Boy was very confusing. And at different times in the book the pace would change and I would totally get lost and I would get frustrated. At first I thought that the book was about death then it turned out to be about love."
2,I thought the book was a little slow but had a good plot.,I liked the concept the book was trying to get across. The author did not do to good of a job at grabbing my attention. I only finished the book because I had to for school. Overall I did not think the book was that exciting. The book tried to display the exagerated possibility of not being able to make up your mind. The book needed a little more edge. The book could have been a best selled if it would of had a little more story to it.
3,"I liked the book, but it was boring in some parts.","The format for the book was excellent, but it started out slow. Talking about all the Englishmen was boring. In the middle, the book picked up a bit. More started to happen. The end was cut off. The main character just died, how stupid is that? Over-all, I enjoyed it, but it could have been better."
1,The book failed to entertain with its dark humor,"After reading this book, as I was forced to for school, I really found myself dissinterested in the characters. Without giving too much of the book away let me just say that the dark humor was unattractive to me, and that I was looking for a more light and facetious comedy. But as I had no choice I read the entire book. I would not recommend it for anyone that is pleasure reading, and have totally lost the desire to read any other of her books."
4,A great book about two men who love one woman,This is an excellent novel about two men loving one woman. The two men are named Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Barlow and the woman they love is named Miss. Thanotogenos. This novel is suspensful because the reader does not know if Miss. Thanatogenos is going to pick Mr. Joyboy or Mr. Barlow to be her boyfriend. This is also a great novel because there are many surprises that await the reader throughout the whole story. The only thing that was missing from the novel is more conflict between Mr. Barlow and Mr. Joyboy. Other than that everything else in the novel was great.
4,"It was a good book, though not the best book.","The Loved OneWhen I first started to read it, I thought it was going to be a boring book. Then, slowly, it started to get interesting. It was very well written. I think that it is for advanced readers who can read it and understand it. The storyline gets more challenging as you continue to read it. So I think it was a good book."
4,I liked the beginning but not the ending.,I liked the beginning because it was funny especially when they said that Mr.Joyboy would put happy faces on the dead people. I liked this part because it was a weird way to show that you like someone. I did not like that it was written in non-american english because it made it a bit harder to understand. I also didn't like that Amee killed her-self because she did not know who to marry.
3,I think that the book was very interesting and amusing.,"At first I thought that the book was going to be very boring because I didn't understand it, but when I started to pay more attention to it it became more interesting. I thought that the book was amusing because it was making fun of the burial industry. This book really taught me a little more about the burial industry even though it was a satire. Also the characteristics of each character made them different from each other. The deaths of both Sir Francis Hensley and Aimee Thanatogenos also made you want to keep reading to see what happened at the end. And the love triangle between Dennis, Aimee, and Mr. Joyboy also kept me reading to the end. All in all I thought that the book was good."
5,I love Ralph,"I think I want to start a fan site called ""I love Ralph"". Ralph has got to be one of the most real and endearing characters I've come across in a long time. James F. David has a particular talent for creating memorable characters with depth. This book caught my attention right away and held it until the end. I couldn't put it down! If you enjoy mystery twisted with the paranormal, you will love this book!"
4,Yet another great book by James F. David,"James F. David is one of the most under-appreaciated authors out there. Wes Martin, a reseach psychologist, works on an experiment where he brings together the minds of five savants, each with a special talent. He wants to create a one superior being. But the minds are being altered by a spirit of a murdered and raped girl, who wants revenge for her pain. Along comes another specially-gifted, but evil, participant who wants to use the fusage for his own superiority. Great psychological thriller, one you will keep reading till the very end."
4,Okay,"It's full of Christmas tunes taken from TV shows. Some are duets, most are either Bing or Frank. Sound quality is fair at best. Both of their voices are in good form, but if it was anybody but Frank I'd only give it 2 stars."
4,Crumbling to pieces,"This headset exceeded all expectations for three years. I had multiple colleagues buying the same equipment due to my advocacy. I am using this daily, hours on end for work and travel. Pairing is excellent, sound quality great and you can wear it for hours. After two years the earpads started to disintegrate, no biggy. But now the plastic is chipping off piece by piece, the matrial has become soft. Glueing is not an option. The left earpiece has now fallen off. Sound quality is still excellent, the battery still lasts for days. But I can't put the thing on my head anymore. And Plantronics doesn't sell anything similar anymore: stereo, BT, over the ear."
4,An excellent lesson for all of us busy parents,"I recently purchased this book for my daughter. She enjoys the illustrations and I particularly enjoyed the story line. The story is about a young hippo who longs for the attention of his very busy father. It reminds us that a child needs more than toys, food and an abundance of activities -- or in the hippo's case, ""mountains of food, lots of things to play with and plenty of mud"". They need the attention of their parents, and in this story, especially the attention of dad. This adorably illustrated story goes through the creative ways a growing hippo tries to ""capture"" his busy father's attention and the wonderful time they had when he finally succeeded. This is a nice addition to our large library of story books, one both myself and my daughter enjoy."
4,Very good book for the price!,"For the price of this book, it is an excellent value. Lots of information thru-out the years of the 300SL. However, not much description about the changes from year to year."
5,New book on Chine Collé available now (2009) by Crown Point Press,I am writing from Crown Point Press to let all the printers out there know to check out our new Magical Secrets book on Chine Collé by Brian Shure. It is available now in 2009 and is $55 with full step-by-step instructions and an instructional DVD. We are disappointed at the price gouging that is going on for our out-of-print version published in 2000.
4,A PLEASANT SURPRISE,Surfing thru BBC series...I came across this series in a box collection..1-4.The first 3 was great and a pleasure to watch. But with Mickey Bricks (Adrian Lester) gone for whatever reason...with Danny Blue ( Marc Warren) taking the lead in set 4 it lacks the panache of the first 3. I have seen while surfing the BBC list of series that there is a set 5 with Adrian Lester back. Hopefully it will soon be available for USA purchase and as good as the first 3.
1,It boggles the mind...,"Okay, Madonna's previous success not withstanding, this might be a decent single, but it is terrible as a Bond theme. The staccato opening in the theatre sound system sounds like there's a problem with sound. It doesn't work. Madonna does not have the vocal depth required (in the same way she should never have been Evita... talk to Patti Lupone!)It's a pity they couldn't afford to get Robbie Williams instead."
5,Yowza! This CD is on FIRE!,"DIE ANOTHER DAY is one of Madonna's catchiest tunes in recent years....and the video is no doubt one of THE best I have ever seen.Check out this sweet maxi-single, with bump and grind beats that will keep you on the dancefloor all night long!"
2,NOT a Bond theme - a noisy techno-jumble,"I was psyched to hear Madonna would be doing the theme song for the new film (which is one of the best Bonds in years.) Sadly, her song, and much of the opening titles sequence is a mess and nowhere near as good as recent ones like ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" This is yet another tired, sad, pale imitation of the audio sequencing trend that began with Cher's ""Believe."""
5,Madonnas aka Bond Girl has another major hit,"Madonna has done it again, shes gone and topped herself with the coolest, most edgiest, most catchiest sounding tune of the year.I mean, this is just an amazing song and the video brings it all together. You have go and get this new single and the bond soundtrack when it hits stores, its a major must have for anyone that likes their music on the cutting edge with that madonna touch."
5,it's a good book,"I read his first one and didn't learn anything. it's the same recycled stuff from any other book. His second book really helped me with post flop play. I am good at preflop and reading players and situation. But I would often get confused as what to do when I flopped something i didn't like, or could use. Truth be told I am winning more of those hands. If you've read some books or have some experience i would suggest saving your money and just buying book 2. if you have never played before, or read anything I would hold off on book 2."
5,"Great fit, even for my 11 year old truck","Bolting things up to an 11 year old truck can sometimes be problematic, but in this case not an issue. Curt delivered a nice looking, beautifully finished hitch that installed with no problems on my '99 Ranger. The instructions were model-specific and accurate, and it's engineered in a way that required no drilling - it attached using only factory holes with the supplied high-quality hardware.The powdercoat finish on the hitch seems durable and well applied, and overall I suspect it will probably outlast the truck.Amazon's deliver was *amazing*. With ""free"" Prime shipping, it was at my door approximately 24 hours after ordering, which is pretty impressive for a big, awkward chunk of steel."
1,I spliced the cord myself!,The mic on the cord is a pain. I actually rewired the product so I can use it in my car. I love Motorola but this product is a big disappointment.
3,"nothing yet,........","I have taken the psychic attunement with my girlfriend two weeks ago and so far neither myself nor my girlfriend have experienced anything that could be considered pyschic in anyway. However, I do understand that it could be a slow subtle process so we are still hopefull. we will take the attunement once again tonight and see what happens. maybe it's the way we are taking it? is anyone doing any special prep before the attunement ie; fasting, meditation, or anything else?so it has now been 3 weeks since my second go at the attunement and i still feel nothing. my girlfriend however, has been experiencing deja vu on a regular basis. so maybe it is working for her?? I will try one more time next week."
5,3Guys+ Major talent- (any mindless drones)=love4Velvet teen,"I have seen them live, I have all of their albums, even compilations, did I mention how great their music is? It is amazing and brilliant. Simple as that. You can listen to it over and over and never be sick of it. The music has so many dimensions its crazy awesome! check it out! You'll be very happy you did."
1,does not work,I ordered this item and when I got it it did not work and the battery section did not turn like it said so I returned and got a replacement and had the same issue. I called the company and they are sending me a new version. Hopefully that one will work better.
1,Not worth the money,I bought this and when recieved it worked great. The dogs reacted well and didn't bark. We only used it when necessary and I even ordered more batteries for it. It has now been less than a year and it no longer works. At first I thought it was the battery so I replaced the battery and nothing. I would not buy this item again and would not tell anyone I know to purchase it.
3,Weak Collar,The device works very well. We have a large dog and it keeps him quiet at night. The collar is very cheap. It only lasted two weeks and the latch broke. We had to purchase a new collar and transfer the device.
5,Excellent buy,"My dog (mixed beagle) is a barker and it got to the point where the neighbors started to complain. I did my research and chose this collar after seeing all the high reviews on amazon. It was a great choice! I started off putting it on my dog every time she went outside. She got shocked a few times and that was enough. I now only put it on her when it's nighttime or I leave the house, since she has a dog door and can go outside whenever she pleases. It has really worked for us without having to go to the extreme to get her to stop barking.My only concern is that it won't shock her if she does just a little low bark. However, that could be due to the fact that I did not tighten it quite as tight as the manufacturer recommends. That's not really a problem for me, but I could see it being a problem for others. I still give it 5 stars because if she tries to bark loudly, it zaps her right away. I definitely recommend this collar."
5,Works great!,"I bought this for my MinPin because she is not exactly hospitable when it comes to strangers. I only got it for her because my relatives were coming into town, and did not want her barking 24/7 when they stayed at my house. It defintely works!"
5,Works great,Stopped my dog from barking within 2 days...at first I was reluctant to get the shock collar...but it's better than getting complaints about his barking...
2,"Good product, EXCEPT for proprietary battery","I like the features BUT: Proprietary batteries just make you have to go back to the same company for over-priced batteries, and make you have to carry an inventory because they are harder to find."
4,PetSafe - No-Bark Collar,"Effective product, but not happy shocking our dog. Made her cry and be afraid. Looking into other means of controlling the barking. Arrived timely and in excellent condition."
2,Sensor issues,"I bought this item about a year ago for my dog when she was young and liked to bark when left alone. During the first few uses, it seemed effective, and the dog quickly learned not to bark. Now,with additional of another dog, she has started barking again along with the new dog. I went back to this collar, replaced the batteries, and tested it to make sure the vibration sensor still worked. Unfortunately, it's now so insensitive to vibration that the dogs cannot trigger it. I'm not exactly sure how the product went defective since it was in a well isolated drawer space during its down time, but the long short of the story is that I'm now back looking for a better quality substitute for this device a year later, even though the device was rarely used."
1,Not for small dogs,"The amount of vibration needed to cause the collar to ""correct"" your dog is set too high. The instruction manual tells you to rub it along carpet to see if it's working properly. In order to get it to work I had to do this excessively. I couldn't see how that much friction to get it to go off would be anything close to a dogs bark. Good idea in theory to rely on vibration rather than sound, but without a way to change the sensitivity this would probably only work for large dogs. Long story short, 90% of the time it never worked. BIG waste of money."
1,Useless,"Even though the other recommendations for this product that I checked before I purchased it were OK, I found the product to be completely useless. I followed the directions exactly, tried their trouble-shooting suggestions, and verified that it was working by testing it according to the directions. Tried it on two dogs with barking problems, one large and one smaller (93# lab and a 28# Corgi mix), it didn't phase either one of them. Total waste of $40."
2,Doesn't work all the time,"I use this on my 6 pound yorkie and it fits okay but it doesn't go off when he barks all the time. It's only gone off 3 or 4 times that I've seen. I'm not sure if my dog's bark isn't deep enough or it just doesn't work. He knows that it shocks him and when he has it on he is a little quieter, but I wish it went off every time he barked, not just once in a while because he is afraid of the collar and I don't think he associates it with barking."
1,No rating.,"I purchased 2 for our 2 pets. I was afraid to use them once I thoroughly read all the instructions. Therefore, I have wasted a great deal of money."
2,Short Life Span,This product worked fine for about 3 mos then when kapoof. I replaced the batteries however that is not the problem. I am looking for a higher quality collar at the present time. The dog hair must be shaved on the contact area of the neck in order for this to work at all. Good Luck.
1,Stopped working after a year,This stopped working after a year. Company wanted $40.00 to repair it. Might as well buy from a different company for that much.We used it normally so work stoppage was not our fault.
5,No Barking,"We had concerns that the collar might not work or be too strong for our miniature Schnauzer but were very pleased with the results. We were careful to use the collar as directed and to be with our dog when she was wearing it and getting the corrections. We would reward her for not barking or stopping after a bark by giving her a treat or saying ""good hush.""PetSafe PBC-102 No-Bark CollarIt didn't take long for her to stop barking or only bark once. She now will try to avoid the things that stimulate her to bark. If she sees the neighborhood teenagers out on their skate boards she turns back and stays on the patio or waits to come back in the door. If she does bark she leaves the area and comes to the door. She even continues this behavior when not wearing the collar much of the time."
5,LOVE!!,"Works like a charm! I have a lab mix who is easily excitable, but I don't want her barking non-stop when I put her outside. I'm not willing to be inhumane with my methods though, so I did try this out on myself when it arrived. The prongs work with vibration, so I slid it along the table and onto my wrist, which gave the shocking sensation. Not horrible, although not pleasant. I put the collar on first thing in the mornings and leave it on her all day, whether she's inside or out. I don't want her to associate the collar with going outside or she will likely not want to go outside. One short yip is all it takes and she catches on. We've had the collar several months now, so once in awhile I leave it off and she does a great job of not barking on her own. Worth every penny!! (Maybe I should send one to my neighbor!) ;)"
2,not good for large breed dogs,Have an 80lb weimaraner that continued to bark with the collar on. Probably good for small breed dogs but would caution with large breeds.
5,Works Great!!!,I order this for my dog who barks at everything. I only had to use for 2 weeks at the most. This products works. If she gets out of hand I just have to show it to her and she stops. This has really helped with her barking at everything from birds to people walkin by.
1,No batterie included??,They don't provide a battery and you can only buy it from their website. Not even RadioShack carries it. RIDICULOUS!!
5,"Startling, but not abusive","I actually bought one for myself in the hope that it would stop my snoring. Unfortunately, it does not respond to snores, only barks. However, I tried a few barks to see what the zap was like -- it resembled getting touched by someone who was shuffling in the carpet. At worst, maybe a bee sting. Certainly startling, but not abusive."
1,Defective product,We recived this and it didn't work. The battery in the new unit wasn't any good. It took over 10 minutes to get someone from customer service at this company on the line. They sent me two new batteries and neither one of them worked. Had to return it.
1,Did not work on toy poodle,"Although the unit responded to ""test"" off the dog, did not work on the dog. Followed directions to properly tighten, but never responded despite several tries. Sent unit back within narrow time frame. Amazon responded promptly and satisfactorily."
1,"Tried two collars, both broke within weeks","I bought the collar, it broke. PetSafe sent me another one, it broke. They both appeared in fine physical shape when they broke. Contacted them about a third collar, and PetSafe is choosing to ignore me. Total piece of crap."
1,Cheap collar,"While my dog did not bark for the two hours that she had it on, the collars connection snap did break. I found the collar out in the yard about two hours after I initially put it on her. I would not buy from this company again."
4,biglittlev,"After a neighbor left a message that I must be on vacation (I wasn't) since my dog was quiet I decided that it was time to do something. My seven year old beagle loves to ""tree"" squirrels and will sit and bark/bay all day while the squirrel remains in the tree. We already had an electric fence collar on him to keep him in the yard so I was skeptical about getting another collar, but this bark collar is terrific! Squirrels are stilled ""treed,"" but now my beagle just sits quietly at the base of the tree.The bark collar is very gentle and gives just a reminder buzz once the dog figures out what is going on which really only took my beagle a few minutes. The only problem I have is that the batteries don't last long and you can only get them at a pet store or through an online service such as Amazon. Otherwise this is a great and humane way to curb a loud dog."
2,Not happy with it.,"It worked the first time I put it on my dog. You could hear it working. She figured it out within about 3 barks and got the message, so I thought it was a success, but then it never really worked after that. I certainly never heard it again. I tried replacing the batteries twice, but nada. My dog still barks less but is slowly figuring it out that it's not working. I don't know if it's the batteries or the collar (but if I have to replace the batteries after every use it's certainly not worth it.) Anyways I've gone ahead and ordered http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00173CWDW/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 mostly because it's rechargable! Hopefully it last longer than this one!!"
3,Im still Unsure,"This collar does exactly what the description says. BUT i wasnt expecting it to be such a strong SHOCK. I thought it would be more like a firm Vibration or something. Like good parents we tested it before we Put it on our dog. I tested it on my hand....and the First warning shock was enough for me. My Husband on the other hand couldnt resist getting the full effect, watching his mouth jitter when he ""barked"" has left me with mixed emotions. I new what i was buying, but for me (and dont get me wrong i like well behaved dogs) I dont think i will be able to leave it on either of my dogs unattended, in other words.....i think i would feel better re directing their attention while im home, and just hoping for no barkng when im gone."
2,It's not perfect,I felt bad puting one of these on my dog to begin with but his barking was out if controll. The collar will not activate sometimes and let him get away with three or so barks while activating when he shakes his head giving mixed signals. We still use it if we know there is going to be a situation where he is goin to bark but for the most part keep it off.
1,TERRIBLE,"This is the most horrible product ever. I tried it on my dog once and you would have thought someone or something was attacking her. She went crazy, biting anyone that tried to help her. I ended up having to get stitches. This is an unsafe product. I would NEVER recommend this to anyone. I feel like a terrible person for even trusting this. I should have known better. If you love your pet, PLEASE don't ever buy this. I feel bad that I even returned it. I can only hope they destroy the package instead of reselling it.PS. It's unfortunate that I can't rate this item zero stars."
5,Works great,My very loud Beagle annoys the neighbors around us while we are not home. He howls and barks constantly. I got the No-bark Collar and that solved the problem. He has even stopped his barking while the collar isnt even on. This item works very well.
1,DO NOT buy if you need a powered Firewire port.,"I purchased this for my dell laptop because my built in port is four pin and un-powered... this card seems to solve the problem, but it doesn't. You still have to buy an additional AC power adapter. This seems to defeat the whole purpose of having the card in a laptop."
5,This is fabulous!,"As someone who loves to vacation in the Caribbean, I embrace anything Caribbean themed. This helps to get through cold Michigan weather during Christmas time. It has quickly become one of my favorites."
1,Formatted to not play on DVD-R,These DVDs have been formatted so that they will not even play on a DVD-R to avoid any chance of bootleg copies. I have a DVD-R because my VCR finally broke and I like to tape televised sporting events. I have not and will not ever copy a DVD but Richard Simmons has assumed that someone will and has prevented me from even using the DVDs. I am extremely disappointed. I have Sweated to the Oldies for many years and do love the routines and work-outs but now I can not. Anyone who has watched the tapes (VHS or otherwise) knows that he even threatens to arrest his own mother for copyright infringement..well I'm not laughing now. It's ridiculous. It should clearly state on the DVD case or product information that the DVDs will not play on DVD-R. He has lost a customer and a fan.
2,Poor DVD quality unfortunately,"My mother used to workout to Richard Simmons and I just couldn't remember which tape she liked.Well we got the DVDs and it turns out to be Sweatin to the Oldies Vol. 3 that she loves. The other ones she said the music was terrible that she had to shut off.Also the DVD quality was poor. It's supposed to get better when converting from tape to DVD but maybe it was just the set i got.Returning the item was super simple through amazon.So now, I will find Sweatin to the Oldies 2 & 3, and Disco sweat which she loved.My mother is very heavy set and I think these are the best workouts for her body. She's not intimidated at all with the people in the workout because they're all different sizes."
5,Fun!!!!,"My friends and I have been having a terrific time. It gives a wonderful workout, and we love the enthusiasm that Richard has! We find it easy to do it often because of the variety."
4,was a gift,It was a gift for someone who loves oldies and wanted a work out...so there you go...time for Ole Richard to do his thing.
4,Blood In the Borscht,"A man sitting in the barber chair unassumingly gets his throat slashed. A fourteen year-old girl dies in child birth leaving behind a diary whose contents causes mayhem within the Russian Mob in London. ""Eastern Promises"" is a good film but falls short of it's potential. The underlying mystery is OK but nothing earth shattering. The film has good ethnic color but doesn't shed much light on the inner workings of the Russian Mob. The film's main strengths are terrific lead performances by Viggo Mortensen as the mysterious gangster Nikolai and Naomi Watts as a mid-wife of Russian extraction who is drawn into the sordid events depicted in the film. ""Eastern Promises"" is worth checking out with minor qualification. Not for the squeamish, though."
2,I Don't Speak Russian,"This movie could have been better if there were subtitles for the Russian spoken. There are a multitude of scenes, some seemingly quite important to the movie, that the viewer has NO idea what they are saying. There is ALOT of Russian spoken in this movie. I was very diasspointed in this movie. The Russian characters were hard enough to understand when they spoke english."
2,I wanted to like this movie but...,"I am very disappointed. The actors give it their best but how could you possibly save an ill-constructed story line????? It looks as if David Cronenberg wanted different kind of scenes (violence, sex etc...) and sort of patched them up together. I felt bad for Vincent Cassel, his script was soooo silly. The story is filled with loopholes. One more thing : inserting violence and sex for no other reason than for the wow factor is pathetic. I really wanted to like the movie, I mean, I love Viggo Mortensen, I could forgive him practically anything but geez!!! this movie is bad."

2,good fights; should have had more fights,I was kinda bored. Expected more fights. The fights that were there were good. Should have more fights and better ending.
3,Eastern Promises,"Very much along the lines of A History of Violence - lots of violence. Anyone interested in the Russian Mafia will find this very insightful. Not the sort of movie you will want to watch over and over, but still very entertaining. Naomi Watts seems a bit light weight for her role which needed a more gritty actress in my opinion (Uma Therman would have been a better choice I thought)."
4,PROMISES DELIVERED,"With quality acting performances all around, EASTERN PROMISES delivers a taut story about the Russian mafia. Viggo Mortensen plays the chauffer/bodyguard to the alcoholic son of a Russian mob chief, the elder wishing to keep certain deeds secret. A diary pops up with incriminating facts and the plot cranks up like the motorbike that female interest Naomi Watts rides around town, trying to find a home for the baby of an abused underage girl. But, for me, the plot is secondary to the interesting peek into another world, a world of hard Russian criminals, speaking half Russian and half accented English, some having escaped from the KGB in their homeland, and wearing tattoos like dark graphic novels about their past trials and affliations. There is a brutal fight scene that is flinchingly violent but, for the most part, the violence is implied in a glance or a word. Certain to be a classic of crime noir."
2,OK but NOT magnetic!,"I was disappointed with these scissors. I guess they are as good as average kitchen scissors, but I wish now I had purchased some that came apart for cleaning. I really wanted these because they were advertised as magnetic and my drawer space is very limited. That's not the case. I went back to look on Amazon and the picture is very different than what I received. Mine have no magnetic buttons on the sheath. It's easier to keep them rather to send them back, but just a warning - you might receive magnetic scissors or you might not."
3,grudging acceptance,"As others have noted, this stuff does seriously reek, even more than the other formulas made from dying cattle. It does, however, stay down better than the powdered products, even the powdered Alimentum, perhaps because it's thicker. If circumstances leave you no alternative but to supplement your baby with formula, the ready-to-feed products are handier and perhaps better-tolerated until you can get your baby onto fruits, vegetables, and grains. If your baby tolerates the RTF soy formula, that's an obvious better choice than this stuff."
4,Great for milk protien allergy,"My daughter has a milk protein allergy and we had to switch to this formula. It's been great so far. Yes, it is more expensive than all the other formula, but there are not a lot of options if your child is allergic to cow's milk. Right now the formula is on sale (about $6.50 per bottle vs. $9 per bottle). I think it is due to the Similac recall that everything is on sale. I would stock up now if you are able! We have tried the powder version and to be honest it smells disgusting. It makes me want to vomit although the baby does not seem to care. I just can't handle it and we only use it when we are out of the house and can't keep a cold bottle with us."
3,Price increase..cheaper at local stores,My son (who is 8 months old now) has been on this formula since he was 3 months old! He had acid reflux. We found this product on Amazon and immediately signed up for Amazon prime to have this delivered straight to our door with 2 day shipping. However the price has gone from $53.94 for 6 bottles to $60! It is no longer cheaper to purchase here on Amazon. It now equals about $10 a bottle and we can get it at our local large chain grocery store for around $9/bottle plus we can use coupons that Similac sends us! Very disappointed..we loved the ease of ordering through Amazon while also saving money. Sad day for my family when Amazon lets us down!!
4,"Great formula, easy to use -- wish it was available through subscribe-and-save",We discovered after trying to use a dairy based formula that our daughter had a dairy sensitivity. My sister-in-law suggested alimentum and it worked wonders. I hate having to mix the powder so we use the ready to feed and it's fantastic. We just use a sharpie to mark when we opened it so that we can keep track of the 48 hour limit. I also love that the top has a mechanism to help with opening the foil top.My only complaint is that I wish it were available through subscribe-and-save through Amazon; I have to remember to re-order every two weeks.
3,Houston Texans Car Window Flag,I like the Houston Texans Car Window Flag. My only concern is that it has two suction cups at the top of the flag only. It should also have suction cups at the bottom. I need to decide how to attach the bottom of the flag to the window. The quality of the flag is great!
5,wonderful!,"I heard this work from Saint-Preux during the 80s when they were still the old records. I still have it actually. Recently I wanted to give as a gift for a friend and that is when I came to find the CD on the Amazon site. Well, I already knew the work, which I love! But my friend never heard about before, and she just loved it also. There are some extra songs that were not included on the old record that are from another of his work, I'm not sure about the title of the other work, Confidence I think. But I can say it's a very worthy purchase. Now I have to get his other works which I never heard about before, because I'm sure they must be also very good."
1,Character assasination of Scott by professional debunker,"The best thing about writing a book about a long-dead character is that they can't fight back. Roland Huntford is a professional journalist of the worst kind who literally uses his ""intuition"" to invent history when the facts inconveniently contradict his view. Huntford's purpose in writing the book was to make money; not to write anything approaching truth. His book is very readable, more's the pity - it's just rubbish.Rather read Ranulph Fiennes book, ""Captain Scott"", which tells the story from the viewpoint of someone who knows Antartica and who presents a balanced viewpoint. He also highlights a number of untruths written by Mr. Huntford."
5,fantastic!,"I'm so happy this has been released on DVD Region 1! It's a nice transfer too, but there isn't much in the way of extras on the disc apart from a gushing Quentin Tarantino extolling the virtues of Wong Kar-wai. But who can blame him? Wong Kar-wai could possibly be one of the greatest directors alive today, and Chungking Express is a beautiful movie. It's wonderfully filmed and full of touching moments, humor, and a unique vision and atmosphere rarely encountered in mainstram cinema."
4,Criterion Blu-Ray really good with one major flaw,"First off I love this film. Review is for the quality of the Blu-Ray.Visually this film has never looked better. It's not going to be the best showpiece for a home theatre, but for the film it is it's awesome. My reservations are with the 5.1 audio mix. For the most part it's fantastic. My big gripe is with how the song ""California Dreamin'"" is mixed. In the old stereo mix by the Quentin Tarantino presented DVD when the song was introduced it was loud and beautiful, dominating the audio track. Now in the new 5.1 mix the song is muzzled and made to sound more realistic and lower in the scene, coming from a boom box outside of the camera frame which really takes from it's impact. I've seen the DVD a million times and can't get used to the new introduction to California Dreamin' on the Blu-Ray and lets be honest the song is iconic to the film. Well, that's my gripe. Not a deal breaker when purchasing this incredible film in high definition, but damn..."
2,SORRY,"This will contrast most of your opinions, but I thought this movie was far too weird and had no plot. I agree that the cinematography was great and it's very unique and stylish in its own way but I really did not enjoy this."
5,Gorgeous!!,"I've been wearing this fragrance for about 10 years and constantly get compliments on it. It's very light and cool. If you hate the over-powering fragrances that seem to be so popular now, try this one!"
1,BAD,The Eau de toillette was not the original nor the package and the smell was all evaporated: my experience with this product was not good
5,Awesome worship cd,"I'm always looking for new worship music, and when i found this album i was really pleased. What i liked about it the most is that there were upbeat songs that sound great in the car, as well as a couple of ""deeper"" worship songs. My favorite songs are Amazed, Jesus, In your presence and One Thing. Lead vocals on this cd are excellent, with strong vocal performances by Mark Cullen as well as a number of the Riverview artists including Penny Webb. I also liked the fact that there is a songbook available, so i've picked up a copy and given it to our worship leader at church. I really recommend this title."
3,Carole versus Lanz Nightgowns,"I was surprised and disappointed as I thought I was ordering two ""Lanz"" (of Salzburg) flannel nightgowns for my wife and these nightgowns by ""Carole"" showed up. They seem nice and warm and my wife likes them but she has always used Lanz flannel nightgowns and that's what I believed I ordered (I Googled Lanz nightgowns and was directed to Amazon. Since my wife and I frequently shop at Amazon, I ordered through Amazon). As I said, I was disappointed."
1,Not like any attunement I have given or received! AWFUL!,"This was awful. I am a Reiki Master/Teacher and this video attunement was of poor quality and unlike your typical attuement--in a bad way.I cannot understand all of the praise. First of all, Reiki should be a peaceful, meditative experience. Between hand placements, there is an annoyingly loud noise to move on to the next one. It breaks up any type of tranquility and calm. Secondly--is he for real? Sedona is a peaceful place but his giant crystal to use as a focal point looks like a big block of clear plastic.VERY DISAPPOINTED! Thank goodness I was able to sell it on ebay!"
1,PLEASE!!! Don't throw your money away!!!!!!,"This is absolutely the biggest piece of junk that I have EVER thrown money at!! This thing eats batteries every two days (whether I turn it off when my dogs come in or not!)!! I have spent more money on batteries in two months then I did on the original item AND I am not even using the shock function, just the noise!!! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE save your money and your sanity!!"
1,Delay in shock make this product useless,"Product seems to be fairly well made, but there is about a 2 second delay, and sometimes longer, from the time you hit the remote button until the time the dog receives the shock. This is unacceptable. We purchased this unit because we have a new dog being introduced to our 3 cats. We don't want to have to wait a few seconds before the dog is corrected; he can chase and catch a cat in that amount of time. We need instant results when we push the button, and we're not sure why this product doesn't provide that. Unfortunately, we waited too long before we discovered this problem, so we cannot sent this back. We would return it if we could."
4,Awesome,"I have a Flat Coated Retriever Mix, he is 1 year and a month old. He was very wild and always ran away when he got out. Sam would also jump on guests and pull on the leash when we walked him. The first time i used this collar there was progress. I only had to used the shocking part 3 times. The rest I used the beeping noise, and now be barely pulls on the leash. There is working progress on him running away. Very good product, I recommend to all whose dogs are disobeying their owners. Hopefully this helps you guys."
4,Big dog shock collar,"The products works most of the time. We have a very stubburn puppy that when she wants to run, she runs and doesn't care how high the shock. Our vet told us the snow can also be a factor in the way the collar works. So hopefully it will work better in the spring!"
4,Very Good for the price,"This collar is a good start for 1st time training collar owners like myself. My biggest concern based on other reviews was battery life, but I have not noticed a problem. Our batteries have lasted over a month since we only use the collar when our Great Dane is outside in our fenced yard several hours a day. The collar needs to be adjusted regularly to make sure it stays tight, and seems ineffective when its not very tight. Range is good (though I haven't tested at over ~50 yards) and adjustable setting is extremely helpful, especially for our 120 pound Great Dane that can be very willful. But several weeks of consistent training have proved that the tone feature can be as effective as 'charge'."
2,Works Sometimes,"The collar only works sometimes. I checked the connections with the neon lamp and it is lighting up but my dog is not feeling a charge 80-90% of the time even when it's set at 8 or 9. I switched to the longer probs and it still isn't working as promised. My next option is to shave his neck and try to improve contact that way. I noticed that the button sometimes sticks in the charge position and if it happens to be the time that the dog is actually feeling the charge he jumps several times becasue of the continued shock before I realize the button is stuck. If shaving his neck works and I can ""zap"" him using a 5 or 6 I will say the collar is worth it but if I must crank it up to 8 or 9 and really cause considerable discomfort I won't recommend it."
3,Worked great. When it worked.,"We ordered the first one and it was wonderful. You can adjust the setting and minimal is needed for correction on our large dog. However, it only occasionally worked from 50+ feet away. Our remote quit working so amazon was wonderful and sent a replacement which arrived promptly. That one however, had something wrong with it from the beginning and again, only occasionally worked. It was however, very effective when it did! On the down side, it didn't work as our dog took off chasing a moose and almost was stomped to death! I would recommend it for someone who will be using it only in their yard, in a close and restricted area. Anyone else I would say get something better."
5,Pet Safe Trainer,The product came the day it was promised. I'm very pleased with the Pet Trainer. It's great for big dogs and it is a great Shock/Beeping Collar.A++++
1,shocked her on its own,This collar started repeatedly shocking my dog over and over. My boyfriend had to take the shock to his fingers to get it off in a hurry. We are all traumatised.
1,the range only works for awhile,"i bought this product though a pet store and it worked great for about two weeks, the range on it was awesome, now i have to be within 15 feet of my dog for it to work. new batteries didnt help either."
1,Does not work on Great Dane,"We have an 8 month old great dane. We followed the instructions, and used the training guide it came with. We have a pretty obedient dog, except when we're at the park and she decides to chase someone riding past her on a bike. She only wants to play, but the terrified bike rider just sees a 110+ lb dog ready to kill them. :) We hoped that this would get her attention at a distance. Unfortunately the collar didn't do anything for her. She doesn't care that its on her, no matter what setting we put it at. She still chases bikes and dogs. Also, unless you are pointing it directly at the receiver, it doesn't work. So when the dog is running away from you it didn't work. We tried changing the batteries, and troubleshooting with the company, but nothing has worked. Basically, we're still working on training and have done much better without the use of the collar. If anything, the collar just aggravated her more because it was bulky."
1,Design Flaw,"The product works GREAT for our lab. Unfortuntaley, our Vanilla lab tore it right off the Choclate lab's neck and ate it. If you buy this collar, take te unit off the snap collar and drill holes thruigh a BUCKLE collar and then attach it. Otherwise, you'll end up with a $100 chunk of chewed plastic."
5,Best investment I made,"I bought this for my 2 year old beagle/shepherd mix. The beagle part of her wants to hunt and she would always run over to the neighbors. Since I bought this product, she stays in our yard. The key to this is make sure the collar is tight to their neck. All I have to do now is just push the warning button and she turns around and comes back."
1,"Worst quality I have ever seen, not reliable","Does not work on long hair dogs. If your dogs has long hair, do not even bother! Secondly it just falls apart. Within a week the metal pins had fallen off so I needed to order more. After a month, the collar completely broke and it wont do any stimulation, it will only beep. It does not work 100 yards, It's lucky if it worked 4 feet. And if you live in a cold climate (anything under 30 F) the collar will stop working after being outside for 10 minutes. I was VERY disappointed. Just spend the extra 40 bucks and buy one that you can use and rely on."
2,lasted 2 months,product worked well. but fell just died after 2 months. bought a replacement. did not hold up any longer.
2,"Eh, Maybe for Chihuahuas","This did not work on my American Bulldog. It DID manage to get his attention on walks for the first time I used it, but after that he no longer cared. The shock feature is useless, as the collar does not stay tight enough for it to maintain contact with the skin. Plus, I wasn't really so hot on using this on my dog anyway, I was desperate lol. Waste of money, better spent on a trainer."
2,"Works well, when it decides to work....","I purchased this ""waterproof collar"" to assist in training my dog. He learned quickly that the tone was immediately followed by a shock if whatever behavior he was exhibiting did not stop. Sadly, I have a dog that enjoys the sprinkler system....and I found out that the collar was not waterproof. I now found myself out $130.00 for a training collar that only lived about two months.I contacted PetSafe and braced myself for a fight while attempting to get them to honor their ""Lifetime Warrantee,"" but was pleasantly surprised that they were both responsive and courteous. The support employee on the phone immediately stated that he was not comfortable with trying to repair a unit that had been wet on the interior, and he immediately shipped a new unit with a return postage label for the broken unit.While I do not think this product is everything it could be, the warrantee and the support from PetSafe motivated me to change my initial rating from 2 stars to four."
4,Very good product,"Tried product on myself before using it with our 1 year old dog, would not suggest using higher levels, 5 was enough for me. We only had to zap him once, now responds to the tone. That is a very nice feature. Suggest getting the lithium batteries with collar. Overall, good product and cheaper then going to PetSmart."
3,Works well,"A very effective trainer. Would rate higher if the batteries lasted longer. Our dog picked up the training very quickly, and now is to the point that if he hears a beep, he will stop what he is doing and sit down. Has a good range."
3,Ok ...BUT!,"As much as I like it I also dislike it. The item goes through very expensive batteries very quickly. It would have been cheaper to get a rechargable more expensive model than to have the cheaper model and replace batteries once every 2 weeks. I have a very clever dog and all she needs is a ""beep"" and not a shock. My friend has the same collar and a more stubborn dog and she needs to use the shock sometimes and goes through batteries even faster. Other than that it is a great tool to train your dog and get rid of unwanted behaviors.."
3,Not Really Satisfied With It,"The shock collar works great. I started my Golden Retriever puppy out with this and it has really helped with behavior problems. After 2 days she already knew when she heard the beep alarm to start behaving; therefore I no longer have to shock her. Only problem is signal strength. Capable of 100 yards? YEAH RIGHT! Try 10 feet! I'm not really satisifed because I was hoping I could sit on the porch and (if need be) shock my dog if she goes near the road. No such luck with that, anything past 10 feet is to far away for this collar. I would keep looking elsewhere for a better collar than this one!"
4,Big Dog Trainer,"this product has helped us tremendously with training, I would reccomend it to anyone having problems with their large dog."
1,Worthless Boots...split in 3-4 months,"I wore these boots 6 times, less than 1 hour each time, in 3-4 months and the right one is splitting apart. Seller would not back their product!"
5,HNIA's best album,"I've been a HNIA fan since I first heard ""Home Is In Your Head"" almost 10 years ago. The band has produced a truly eclectic catalog of albums, spanning a variety of different styles. This album showcases their more recent direction, which is more band-oriented and relies heavily on Lovetta Pippin's soulful vocals. Unlike the more recent album, this one still includes other vocalists as well, and that makes for a more interesting listen."
1,Hated this product,"I returned this product after 3-4 attempts at using it. The pain was awful and I didn't like that ""your pores may emit a discharge."" In other words, I was damaging my skin! Will NOT try another product like this again."
4,Amazing,"Everything about This was perfect. I got the item on time, and the show is great. This show is kind of like Dragonball-z (without the endless power-up sequences, and it actually finishes the immediate conflict by the end of the episode) mixed with Gundam Wing. I'm excited for part 3 to come out!"
5,Great text book,"Hille's book on ion channels of excitable membranes provides great instruction regarding the biophysics of channel function. The topics range from discussions of gating, selectivity, etc. The chapters regarding channel function were the most useful"
2,Good Plot nothing else,Since i try to be a positive person ill start with the positive. The plot sequence was relatively good. By this i mean the plot fit the personality of the characters from the original show and one would have no problem visualizing the characters in these situations. However this was the only good point. The dialogue written between characters was awful. The dialogue was very choppy and throught the entire book made the characters sound awkward. The dialogue certainly failed to portray the characters from the show. In my opinion it was something i would have expected to find on a fan fiction site and definitely not something that should have been printed and sold. The dialogue was just that bad.
2,"Great Actors, lousy acting.","Had some great actors in this movie, not even seen on the cover, of this movie. How can you not mention {Joe Pesci}. Anyway, I love so many of the actors here, and yet the story plot line was empty. This is such a shame for so much talent. Even seeing Jodi, naked had little impact for me. Thumps down.."
5,Fun and action,"I've been a fan of Modesty and Willie since the books first came out, and I was a loyal reader of the strip in the London Evening Standard for many years.If you like action novels, with unusual villains, fast-moving scenes, and plenty of tongue in cheek humor, Modesty Blaise is the girl for you, and 'Modesty Blaise', the first novel in the series, is a good place to start.After writing non-fiction for many years, I turned to fiction in 2003, and my first novel 'Snides' is available on Amazon. As a gesture of homage to Peter O'Donnell, I created an action duo, John Pilgrim and Sally Brandon. They're not straight copies of the originals and the best, Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin, but I've tried to hit their target of plenty of action, with a little humor.I own the complete series of Modesty Blaise books, and one of them is always on my bedside table. I must have read them all dozens of times, but I still keep re-reading them!Tony WalkerScottsdale, Arizona"
1,One of Grant Green's lesser efforts,For the collector...Nice reissue.For the jazz listining public: This is a throwaway recording...enough to feed a habit and nothing extra. Unfortunate.
3,Not so good funk,"If there ever was a Grant Green cd you could afford to skip, it would probably be this one. Definitely not one of his better recordings, even if you like the funky stuff."
4,Charge the Shield Wall!,"Bernard Cornwell, perhaps our best writer of the historical adventure novel today, scores high with the first book in his Saxon Stories. I'm a devoted follower of Cornwell, and in my opinion, The Last Kingdom ranks with the better Sharpe stories and exceeds The Heretic.The Last Kingdom tells the story of the 9th-century Danish (Norse or 'Viking') invasion of Anglo-Saxon England (or Englaland as they said a millennium or so ago). The fierce Danes roll over three of the four kingdoms and have only to finish off the pious Alfred, King of Wessex. This book begins the story of Alfred's resistance. The Saxon Stories relate how Alfred became known as the only 'Great' king in English history.Highly recommended for fans of Cornwell or anyone who like historical adventure stories. Terribly exciting battle scenes on the 'shield wall'."
2,"Decent story line, Poor story telling","The Last Kingdom has a decent story line, but the writing itself is pretty dull. I found myself skimming by half way through the book, wishing I could just quit. In the end I finished, but I did not find the story telling to be very engaging. The story line itself is well developed, but I do not recommend this book."
3,A historical reality in which blood and guts flow. Not for the squeamish .,Having lived most of my life in the land of the Vikings and been born in East Anglia this book went straight home. However these circumstances are not a requirement to enjoy this well written and thoroughly researched book about those early days in the history of England and Denmark While bloodthirstyness dominated the pages there is also examples of humane tenderness. Not unlike this present ageI look forward to reading the other books in this series. Thank you to the author ..Gilian M Beresford Holby.
3,"If you like battle scenes, ""go fer it.""","This is one of those books that really makes me appreciate the ""other"" historical books I've read.Flaws?Not enough female characters. (This is the first time I've made this complaint. I'm shocking myself.)Too many battle scenes. Most of this book takes place somewhere between cities on the battle field.Not enough culture. When you finish this book, you won't feel like you know life in Medieval England. I wish that I better know what it was like to be a peasant or royalty, preferably both. After reading First Man in Rome, I felt I had lived the life of a Roman. After reading this novel, I felt I knew what it was like to fight with an axe.Well written, but lacking..."
4,"If you like Beowulf, you'll love this novel","I'm not a big reader of historical fiction, but saw a blurb about this book in a bookstore flyer and was immediately interested. And now that I've read it, I've already run out to buy another Cornwell novel and can't wait to read the sequel to The Last Kingdom, The Pale Horseman. I read this novel in 4 days, whereas the last book I read took me over a month. It's fantastic.I love this period, where so-called kings are really just successful warlords and politicians, and the land is ruled by chaos as much as everything else. The action is thrilling, the characters interesting, and the descriptions ultra-vivid.My only demur is that Uhtred is portrayed as a rather heartless man, but perhaps part of the theme of the novel is that in order to survive as a warrior in the ninth century, one had to be pretty heartless. He is certainly a compelling anti-hero, and I'm eager to read about how he finally becomes a loyal subject to King Alfred."
4,Great Book,I listend to this one on cassette but I most certainly could and would have read it had I not gottent ot he audio first. Great book and highly recommended.
5,Immensely Enjoyable,"I received a new Kindle as a Valentine's present and I knew this would be my first Kindle book. I was not disappointed. This may be Cornwell's best novel(I've only read 2, but I can't imagine anything topping this!). It is NEVER boring, the prose is effortless, and the insights on 9th century life and warfare are very interesting. I especially like the way Cornwell is telling the tale of Alfred the Great in an oblique manner. Alfred as the central protagonist would not make for a great novel, but seeing him through the young warrior-hero's eyes provides the perfect perspective. It also helps answer the question of how civilization survived the Viking threat. Both the English & Danes are treated with balance & respect, and as the reader you share the hero's dilemma about which side to choose. And when the choice is made, Cornwell does it so perfectly and convincingly that there is no doubting it. Destiny is all!"
1,appalled in alaska,"In reading a preview for this book, I found that this was a rewrite from a previous novel and was used to 'fit' into the 'Song Series'. It didn't fit very well from my perspective. Within the first few pages of this book, a woman is raped by a (supposed) leading character in a future novel by Ms. Coulter. It is beyond my thinking that this would equate to a ""good romance"". I found nothing of value in this book and would not recommend it to another. If I had wanted to read a gruesome true to life novel, I certainly would not have thought to find it located in the romance section. This book was not a romance or very well written. The characters were not well developed and were somewhat shallow and narrow. I am sorry that I purchased this book and will not purchase anything by this author again."
3,OZZY RULES!,"Ozzy is captured here at the height of his mettalic powers - and he's preaching to the faithful with these wild videos from his 'No Rest For The Wicked' album. The first video is 'MIRACLE MAN' (uncensored), the second video is 'CRAZY BABIES,' and the third is 'CRAZY TRAIN' from the Randy Rhodes Tribute album. There is also about 10 minutes of behind-the-scenes footage of Ozzy and the band during the making of 'Miracle Man' and 'Crazy Babies' videos. The tape is too short - only 18 minutes long. But worth it if you're a true fan."
1,It's Not a Bible. Useful only for Adaptec EasyCD users.,"This book was a disappointment. It claims to be ""100% authoritative, comprehensive..."" It is none of these. It provides only a cursory description of the most popular CD formats and provides little practical information on how to use them. Other than a buying quide for beginners, most of the book's content is devoted to a description of Adaptec's EasyCD and CD Creator software packages. The other software packages that is claims to ""cover"" are given a few pages in the appendix. If you are a begining user and are using this Adaptec software, you will probably find this book useful. Everyone else should save their money."
5,REPLAY!!,"Ahhh...Beakman's World. Who would ever forget this series, a cross between Mr. Wizard and Monty Pyhton? You know I couldn't! I used to watch this every Saturday at noon when it was on.Lester the Rat, Beakman and Rita tells us all about science in fun ways, and they make it understandable to little kids. It's fun and educational! It's a win-win situation!I really hope that they come out with all the seasons on DVD. But, that seems unlikely because a bunch of people forgot this show was even on the air."
4,relive the best of 90s Saturday mornings,"My husband and I used to love watching Beakman's world on Saturday mornings (as well as Parker Lewis Can't Lose), so this show obviously has a broad base. It is irreverant, and shows a more ""urban"" feel than Bill Nye The Science Guy but they are both cut from the same cloth. Quick cut edits, weird sound effects, snappy dialog, fun science. Toddlers wouldn't like or appreciate this or Bill Nye, but my kids (9.5, 8 and 5) all love both, and after watching this DVD, immediately ran outside to try out some of the experiments he showed them. Gotta love that! It is slightly dated (I think they talk about records or cassette tapes in the start of the DVD), but the science still holds, and there's nothing quite like Beakman and his friends!"
1,Sucked,"I didn't like these ear buds. I bought them to replace a set I broke. They were very uncomfortable, and the sound wasn't too good."
3,Termite Hill,"Book arrived within allotted time, but took way longer than I thought it should. Book spine was bent like it was placed in a vise clamp and twisted with damage to both covers."
5,Best Album from Genesis ever,"The songs contained in this album are both catchy, and entertaining. It's not like those other songs in the 80's where you get sick of listening to them after about 4-5 times. This one is a keeper. Phil has a great voice, and songs like man on the corner, and abacab can't be beat. This is the best genesis album yet.... The remastered cd makes it even better."
2,Band on the corner,"With this album, Genesis breaks from their art-rock past and plows into New Wave and then mainstream pop. In addition, the band hired producer Hugh Padgham, noted for his work with the Police, resulting in the band's best sounding studio album to date - a move which will be noticed immediately in the full drum sound.Some of the album works very well - the title track, Dodo/Lurker, and the ethereal beauty of Me And Sarah Jane are the standouts. The spareness of Man On The Corner and horn-infused R&B stylings of No Reply At All hint at the rise of Phil Collins, about to become a star in his own right. Abacab suffers, however, from trite lyrics and some filler songs that detract from it's justified strengths. In particular, the presence of the vile and wretched Who Dunnit? (perhaps one of the worst pieces of junk ever committed to tape by a major act) indicates the depths to which the trio is capable of descending. Docked one star for Who Dunnit?"
1,The worst Genesis album,"This album is really boring, you can find here some of the worst compositon of the band, all on the same album, so it deserve well""The worst of genesis"" tag. No reply at all, Keep it Dark, Man on the corner, Like it or not and Another record are simply horrible.Abacab and Dodo-Lurker are just OK but hey, these are not great songs !A big dissapointement !"
1,Phil Collins and Lyle Mays!!!!!!!!!!1,Imagine if Phil Collins and Lyle mays got together . . You'd Love it wouldn't You? I think it wouldn't be that great. Just like this album.
2,WRONG DIRECTION,"I bought this album because of the great tune "" NO REPLY AT ALL "". I was also a fan of Peter Gabriel's phase. But, other than the song i quoted above, this CD in an unbeliavably bad collection of synthesized garbage, it has nothing to do with the real Genesis. A waste of time and money."
4,the really brilliant record by these 3,"The previous record was heavily influenced by David Hentschel and was sonically inferior to this one, although material-wise DUKE and ABACAB are similar. With the new sounds that Collins and engineer Hugh Padgham found here (especially the insanely-compressed percussion) this album launches the band into the stratosphere. Easily my favourite title by them, all the session's outtakes and b-sides are also worth hunting down. ""Who Dunnit"" and ""Keep It Dark"" (the latter a UK 12"" single) are among the cleverest, best recorded that this band ever produced. It's a shame that susequently only the 5-track studio side of follow up 'Three Sides Live' came close to recapturing this magic. I loved this record enough back-in-the-day that I repurchased it for $17 on japanese vinyl, just to wring that last bit of fidelity out of my stereo. IMPRESSIVE!"
4,I was a 98 pound duckling too!,"I read this as a tween, and I really enjoyed it. I ended up buying it again as an adult to see if the book still held up after all this time, and it did. I think the author wrote about something so universal in all of us as we are growing up and finding out who we are and all those insecurities we have then too. I recommend this book to ages 12 and up."
1,In the company of losers,"I gave this farce one star - to be shared by the acters who actually had the guts to be in the film and the producers who who were foolish enough to pay the screenwriter for the script. This was by far the poorest excuse for a (guy's?) movie I've ever seen. This film was embarassing to watch. However, I stayed with it in hopes that it might have some redeaming qualities toward the end. No such luck. Overall, this film was/is a sad commentary on the state of many of the films being distributed out of LA these days."
1,Please don't waste your time,"This is by far the worst ""movie"" ever made. It made me want to pierce my eyeballs with a fork and eat them. The story is terribly slow and the plot is idiotic. Who ever enjoyed this movie has serious issues. 2 men make a handicapped woman feel like garbage and that's supposed to be thought-provoking? You're better off trying to fry ants with a magnifying glass in your back yard, it'll be more entertaining and educational than this sad excuse for a film."
3,creepy,I have a stalker. Who is my ex-boss He is Chad to the t.very creepy character. I thought he was psycotic.
2,not so good,"The Coby CVH79 Lightweight Super Bass HP headphones has no bass to them what so ever. After having them for a little over a month they started to sound distorted and started to crack while listening to them. The only thing good I can say about them is that they are comfortable to wear. I know they were not expensive at all, but I also own a pair of the CobyCV-110. They were around the same price and they sound great and are very durable. In conclusion I do not reccomend the CVH79's at all. They are not worth the few dollars plus shipping you have to pay. Coby products are usually pretty good just not this product."
1,Review,"Do not buy this one. I bought this because i had to compensate for a few dollars to be eligible for free shipping. This product did not work at all. I threw away the headphones, as i couldn't get it replaced."
4,Great headphone soundwize,These headphone are very nice since the sound quality is great for me and the bass is just as deep as I want.The only thing I dont like much is the hardness of the part that goes over my head since I have curly/frizzy/wavy hair and it gets kind of caught up in it. If you are wearing a cap or if your hair is straight I dont think it will be a problem.I wear them everyday for at least an hour or so and they also sit in my large shoulder bag that is filled with stuff and so far have held up very well. I like the way they keep my ears warm on cold days.
4,Excellent product for the price,"I purchased 40 of these headphones about a year ago for computer-based training. The headphones work well for this application and the sound is pretty good. Infact, they sound good enough for 15 pairs to walk off. I recently purchased 20 more sets to replace those that were ""borrowed""."
5,Best Headphones you can get for under 5 bucks!,"I just bought these awhile back and I'm very pleased with them. The sound quality is excellent when I use them with my Desktop PC listening to music. The cord is a little short, but that's ok.I hope I can take care of these and make them last awhile. I've broken all of my previous sets of headphones I've owned in the past, some of which I paid up to 20.00 for.hopefully, these ones will last awhile, but if they don't, I will buy these ones again! They're worth every dollar."
1,not worth the 4 bucks,i bought 2 they were deffective not worth sending it back for refund of 4 bucks. only one side works sound quality POOR i guess u get what you pay for...
4,Yantra is missing... from the inner-sleeve art work,"I am really not surprised that this was released without the art work of the inner sleeve. The record companies jam these CD re-releases out there as cheaply and as rapidly as they can.As far as the music on the album, I can't say it's their best but it has some exceptional standout songs. (Voices in the Sky, The Actor, OM). One of the things that held this band together for so long was that everyone contributed to the song-crafting. But we all know that Thomas and Pinder and Edge were not the most gifted in that department, and their songs on ISOTLC are pretty weak.I am confused about people concerned about the album being ""dated"", it was recorded in the late 60's, so it is simply reflection of the time and the culture of the day. Why are they listening to it if that disturbs them?"
1,Not even an SACD,"Talk about false advertising, this is really just a 2-CD set. The first disc is an SACD but just plays stereo. Why is this the only one without the 5.1 mix? Why they didn't just go with DVD-Audio or Dual Disc is beyond me."
3,Where is the Yantra design from the original cover?,"It is unconscionable to omit the Yantra design from inside this album. I can't begin to describe my disappointment. The music is all here and still delightful, but it is an absolute travesty to omit the central visual image of this work of art. The Yantra is a gate that allows the viewer to elevate consciousness to a more serene, yet energetic state. It was not originally included because it looked ""neat"". This release definitely looses some of its impact without it."
3,FWIW - SACD,The 2CD set that I have with appears to be the same artwork and the first disc is a SACD and in stereo. Although the packaging doesn't seem to state that. Surround would have been nice.
5,Enjoying Reexperiencing this Album,"I'd forgotten how enjoyable this disc is. In the 70's, this was my favorite Moody Blues album. I thought it would now sound dated and too hippie. But not so. Many of the melodies are very beautiful. And I now have a greater understanding of the spiritual message behind the songs. (Might now know what is meant by ""Timothy Leary's dead""?)So for all of you that kind of remember the 60's and 70's, this one is worth listening to again."
2,disappointing,"we loved her voice as part of her group, and expected her to be even better onher own. Perhaps she is, but not on this cd."
1,buy the casenotes....,"Truly one of the worst law school books I've used so far. Everything the other (negative reviews) said was true. The author doesn't use footnotes, captions, endnotes, or offset text. No it is all just thrown together in one huge block of text on the page. The reading is nothing more than wading thru a morass of text which actually has no real bearing on the cases presented and doesn't add anything constructive to the understanding of the nuances of the case. horrible writing. Horrible editing. This book would be 1000% better if all supporting text was removed and nothing more than the bare cases were presented.If you are a professor, don't use this book.If you are a student, buy casenotes and only read the cases from this book."
2,Way far from their best,"Such effusive praise here--for such a mediocre little record. What is Threshold compared to Days of Future Passed or the vastly underappreciated To Our Children's Children's Children? Uneven, disorganized, insignificant. Justin Hayward wrote the cool songs, and ""Lovely To See You"" is fun to listen to, but ""Send Me No Wine""? Lame. The rest of it is patchy at best. You're better off with a greatest hits record than this"
5,ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM,"i HAVE HAD THIS ON VINYL SINCE THE EARLY 70'S AND IT HAS WORN OUT, IT IS GREAT TO HEAR IT AGAIN WITH SUCH GOOD QUALITY. MAKES ME FEEL YOUNG AGAIN."
2,Rough read,"My expectations were high but this is just a poorly written book. About half the narrative is about the characters who joined the Rough Riders. Very little of the book deals with the battles in Cuba and the sections that do make the exploits of the Rough Riders seem grossly over rated. Roosevelt seems to write withh the intent on securing his place in history. And, if that wasn't enough, he includes self-serving appendices that laud his conduct on the battlefield and support his yearning for the medal of honor. I found his writing style tedious and often repetitious--you'll encounter countless references to the smokeless ammunition used by the Spanish. Enough already!"
4,Classic.......,"This is just a classic good movie. Everyone in our family enjoys it, and you just can't lose with this one!"
2,Big Disappointment,"I usually love Pratt's books, but this one was not very good.Very little romance and too much war. I hope his next book will be better."
1,Very Disappointing,"This book had all the ingredients of a good story well told. I found it to be neither. The writing is clumbsy and the characters are cliche's, and so is the plot. The ""BIG Secret"" isn't at all hard to figure out. Let's see we have identical twins in love with the same girl who go off to war and only one comes home...I bet you can figure out the big secret just from that syopsis."
5,Read 'em all!,"What most people seem to have forgotten is that the Ringworld books (Ringworld, R.E., R.Thr.) aren't the only books in the series. ALL of the Known Space books must be taken as a whole. For instance, it's impossible to fully comprhend Ringworld E. without having read ""Protector."" All the known space books link together, PLUA the short stories. I suggest reading them all in chronological order and putting the pieces together yourselves. Sure, it will require more trips to the library, but, hey, whoever said life was easy?"
5,Another solid Niven novel,"This is money well spent. I enjoyed this novel and spent nearly a whole night reading it in one sitting. I will never tire of Larry Niven when he sticks to Known Space, the best of his fiction areas. I like the Pupperteers, the Kzin, and Pac. Larry delivers a nearly perfect end to the Ringworld series. I have had personal conversations with him back in 1983 and he never intended to make more Known Space books. Note, you should read this novel before reading ""Ringworld's Children"", due out in Summer of 2004. Enjoy it, I did!"
2,Mediocre,Not very funny. Most were staged pranks -- not bloopers. I thought the title was misleading.I was very disappointed with this purchase and would not recommend.
4,Five Blues Artists from the 1950s,"If your blues collection (like mine) already has Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Hound Dog Taylor, Buddy Guy and Freddie King, where do you go next? The Blues Legends disc is a good way to deepen your program. The five players cut these records in the early 1950s and they stand up well. Most tracks have bass and drums, some even have horns and piano (they aren't ""primitive"" solos like Robert Johnson or Lightnin Hopkins)... Memphis Slim, Sleepy John Estes and Robert Nighthawk were just names to me before I got the disc and I knew Little Walter from his work with Muddy Waters. Two great tracks from each of the five for ten tracks, and good liner notes. A short (30 minute) disc compared to recent extended LP CD's, but solid throughout and great songs. ""Rollin and a Tumblin"" is the standout track................."
4,It more expensive then other brands but you get peace of mind,"Owning my first Italian bike recently I always thought Italian bike owners where a ""different"" crowd. While that may be true, they are often times see the value in using a superior brand of product. I have owned motorcycles for 20 years and had never used Motul. Better late then never! This is a great oil! The bike runs cooler, even when stopped at long lights. The oil looks SO clean at 5000 miles you could swear it was fresh out of the can.All the best,Aaron Lephart"
3,not as good as it should be,"while the SACD sound is very good and 'Pictures' sounds very lively, the other recordings on this disc sound bad. even with the SACD sound, it is as though the orchestra is playing in a room down the hall from the recording devices. now, just because the sound is good on 'Pictures' doesn't mean it is a good recording. the Reiner recording with the CSO is so much better than this, it makes me wonder why anyone would produce a recording if it could not compete with the Reiner/CSO recording. i never get the feeling while listening to this new recording that the orchestra is really into the music. it almost sounds rush an unrehearsed. perhaps i am just biased, but i would rather listen to the older Reiner recording than this newer one."
2,Great but Stinky..,"These shoes are really great walking shoes, but they are very stinky! They are lined with suede which made my feet stink after only a few wears. I have to wash my feet as soon as I remove them.. and I have heard the same from other people who own them. They are quite comfortable.. but Tsubo makes similar shoes without the ransid problem."
5,skechers - the most comfort,Thank you for handleing Skeechers - they are the so comfortable Amazons price was far less than others - Thank you Amazon Sandee Hawk
3,Comfortable,These shoes are not the most stylish but are comfortable. The one thing that these shoes made difficult was what color socks to wear. I have found that the ones that looked the best were tan colored but those are hard to find.
4,Plantar's fasciitis feet,"I was looking for a shoe that I could wear with pants and skirts and not end up feeling crippled by the end of the day. With my Plantar's fasciitis, finding a comfortable shoe that's not my Brooks is nearly impossible, which I guess is a recommendation for Brooks, but they just don't cut it with pants and skirts. These fit well (only exception is a slight pressure on the back of the left heel), the velcro never comes undone as some have complained, and they look nice. I can't wear them for long shopping excursions, I still have to wear my Brooks, but anything else I always choose them. You won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a sneaker, go for the Brooks!"
3,Not as solid as I expected,"Having read many of the other reviews, I don't entirely get it. I've got the grizzly 10"" cabinet saw, around 300 lbs, similar to what many others use this for and I find the base a bit flimsy.You can lock the wheels, yes, but the frame of the base flexes slightly so that the saw can rock a bit. I've taken to use two wedges that I kick into place once I've got it moved where I want it.So maybe my expecations were too high, maybe this IS the best base around and that just means putting up with some wiggle in my saw, but it kinda seems weird to take an expensive saw with a lot of weight that's meant to be ROCK solid on the floor and then make it feel a little woogidy (techinical term). Do I feel as comfortable putting a 4'x8'x3/4"" ply sheet on this now with the base giving it play? No, I don't. It makes for a cut that isn't as straight as it used to be.Not sure this is the right design for the heavier table saws."
4,Jet 708118JMB Mobile base,"I needed to make my old craftsman table saw more mobile. I selected the Jet univeral mobile base based on the design.Overall I'm pleased with the product, my only complaint is I had add wood to the base to bring the saw up to a comfortable work height and it should have been designed with four swivel wheels instead of two. So if your shope space is limited in space consider a mobile base that has four swivel castister."
4,Get the right size,"This is a very good mobile base, but do not get this model to use on a Jet-10TS Proshop table saw (model 708482K). I recently purchased the 10TS table saw (which, by the way, is terrific). Pictured on the instruction manual was this table saw on, according to the caption, a Jet 708118 mobile base. Naturally, I ordered that base, but when I went to set it up, I discovered that--even fully extended--this base is too small by 3/8"" and no amount of coaxing would make it fit.I finally got it to fit by grinding 3/8"" off two of the feet on the table saw. I do not recommend this, because when the base is fully extended (29""), this leaves very little of the side bars in the caster assemblies, making it inherently weak.After repeated correspondence with Jet customer service, they agreed that it was indeed too small and that the proper base for this saw is the Jet 708119. Save yourself the headache and get the 708119 in the first place."
2,JET Heavy duty universal mobile base,"The base is well made, assembles VERY easily and quickly but has a major flaw - the LOCKING wheels do not lock well enough to prevent the saw from moving when you cut heavy material. This is dangerous and makes accurate cuts of larger material impossible. The rotating casters are the worst offenders.I'm disappointed because it is a well made unit and Jet usually produces good quality products. As an engineer I view this as a design flaw rather than a quality control issue."
3,vocal fireworks that takes place in a volcano,"The star of this production is Jimmy Levine and his outstanding Metropolitan Orchestra. He turns this oratorio into a sizzling opera. Too bad the singers acting doesn't ignite as well. Domingo and Borodina are in excellent voice, but seem totally uninvolved in their characters. Borodina especially is not the temptress and sex goddess that Dalila ia supposed to be. She stands and sings note perfect, but there is no interaction between her and Domingo - sparks don't fly even though the lighting director seemed to be in love with the color red. And where does this thing take place, a volcano? There are the mandatory bumps and grinds in the ""bring down the temple"" sequence, but the real action is all in the orchestra. I'm not sorry I bought this DVD, but when I want a more total production, I'll go back to the San Francisco version."
3,Better aurally than visually...,"The costumes and sets are not different enough from traditional to justify their odd effects. It all just seems silly. There is no inspiration here, just red paint and kindergarten fingerprinted hand prints as ""design"".But, I don't buy opera for the great visuals in the main. I'm grateful when they are there, but I can deal with most anything in that department.However, even in the aural department, this just didn't ignite for me. Lieferkus (whom I very much like) is the wrong voice for French opera. Olga Borodina (whom I really really like) was fine, but too phlegmatic in personality for me as Dalila (better when I just listened). Domingo (Old Reliable)was in vintage Domingo form, and in Samson's great aria he was wonderful. But, all in all, this didn't light my fire. I'll go back to the San Francisco version and see how Shirley Verrett and a younger Domingo compare."
5,This CD is The Cat's Meow!,"I have been listening to Disney Children's Favorites since I was four years old. Mr. Groce is a wonderful singer, and his voice is very soothing and sedating. I recently bought his second album last month and it is a hit!!!"
4,THE SHORT FILMS REVIEW,"ITS INTERESTING TO SEE BEHIND THE SCENES FOOTAGE OF MKGTV. OF COURSE, ANYTHING WITH MJ IS WORTH WATCHING ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S IN ACTION!!! DIFFERENT VIDEOS THAT WEREN'T SHOWN ON TV.GOES GREAT IF YOUR TRYING TO COLLECT ITEMS OF HIS OF HIS UNFORGETTABLE WORK"
5,I remember the time,"This is a must own if you loved this album, this MJ era.The Video of in the closet is reason enough to own the dvd. I like even the small details. When you click on the diffrent menu options you see the diffrent graphics from the album in great detail. This dvd gives you the strange and magic world of Michael jackson. A Once in a lifetime performer."
5,So much to relate to in this book!,"I picked up the first book in this series a week ago and literally devoured each of them. Each is full of unexpected twists and heartache, but this fourth book literally had me sitting up into the wee morning hours, tears streaming down my face and a heavy feeling in my chest, as I read of each characters' struggles to honor God (or in the case of some characters, themselves!) I found so many ways to relate to Dianne - headstrong and decisive and often not understanding the effect that her words had on her husband. In particular, I appreciated Ardith's struggle with loss after loss and how that scarred her - but eventually made her strong. This series has left me with much to ponder, as my own family has struggled through the past several years and is trying to focus upon the hope within (of course, that Hope is found only in our Lord, Jesus Christ.)"
2,Prefer the Shirley Bassey Remixes,"I received this CD as a gift. I'll admit that I'm not a huge Nina fan to begin with. Having said that, I really like remixes. When I see ""remix"" I'm thinking ""dance"", and. . . for the most part. . . that's not what this CD is all about. My favorite track is ""Here Comes The Sun"". I listen to it over and over. But at least 50% of the CD I have to skip. If you like dance remixes of ""classic"" tunes, I HIGHLY recommend Shirley Bassey - ""The Remix Album: Diamonds Are Forever"", if you can find a copy.The Remix Album: Diamonds Are Forever"
4,I can't get enough of this,"This is really a superb effort by a committee of DJs and producers to cut, paste, and elongate Nina's melodies, voice, and of course music to more of a contemporary style. Remixed and Reimagined is just that. I never imagined Nina's songs in this matter, but it works. This CD has been my favorite now since I bought it. This is fun for the whole family. Everyone seems to have a favorite. I am a big Nina fan anyway, so having something new and delivered posthumously is a real gift.Key songs:Ain't Got No-I Got Life-Groovefinder RemixTo Love Somebody-Chris Coco's Stadium Rocker RemixO-O-H Child-Nickodemus RemixHere Comes The Sun-Francois K. Remix"
5,CS4 Basics and Beyond Review,"This DVD is essential for learning the ins and outs of Photoshop CS4. The narrator, Jonathan Kingston is a terrific instructor. I highly recommend the DVD!"
5,A great CD,I finally found the CD I've been looking for forever it seems! It was a great CD that brings the child out in anyone and brings back memories of childhood watching these movies with your parents!
4,This is awsome,"Brad Martin's ablum ""Wings of a Honky Tonk Angel"" in a word it is Awsome!! I loved every song on it. I strongly suggest you buy it!"
3,story of the nez pierce,a good history of the nez piercethis work could have been stronger if the author would had defined the nez pierce relationships with the other indian tribes better and whether or not the nez pierce became indian scouts themselves.
2,GARBAGE!,"THIS CD IS A PILE OF TURDS! IT'S POORLY RECORDED AND THE LYRICS ARE WACK AS HELL! BUT IT IS SOME BABY MAKING MUSIC, THAT'S THA ONLY +. ALL IN ALL X-MAN IS THE WORST RECORDING ARTIST EVER! - DEUCE"
2,Good for small messes,"We bought two of these bibs and enjoyed them for a couple months. We would wash Crocodile Creek bibs using a rag and dish soap and let them dry (took at least four hours), so it was good to have two in rotation. The velcro held up and didn't scratch him and he didn't mind them. The pocket worked marginally well. But then my son started eat regular table food and these bibs started to smell from being used too many times--like wet fabric. So I tried a Baby Bjorn bib (hard plastic with open pouch) and fell in love. Only need one of those because it can be easily wiped dry and it's only a couple more dollars than this one. Too bad about the CC bibs since they are so cute."
3,You take what's available,"It had some corner damage I did not expect but other than that it was fine, a perfect copy would have cost considerably more."
3,Jet! What were you thinking?,"Ok, nice package, easy assembly, good quality, stong enough to handle the router table (shop build to Norm Abram's plans 5-Star) with all of my bits three routers, wenches, templates, partridge and pear tree, etc. But no levelers!!! Get the Shop Fox it's not quite as slick but it's every bit as strong and it has levelers! If you've got typical basement/garage floors this doesn't get it."
2,Great product - Very bad package for shipment,"1. I bought 3, only 1 arrived with all the parts. The packaging ruptures in transit apparently spilling the contents across the UPS warehouse.2. Had 2 replacements sent ... they too ruptured rendering neither unit usable. Sent them back.3. Then I talk to India for awhile trying to explain things.4. Then I get a replacement order for 1 ... not 2. The unit was complete!5. I'm hopelessly wrapped up now in the Amazon return purgatory, I think I'll be paying for 4 or 5 as I tried to return 2 units in one shipment. Do not do this. Return any item one for one. Do not try to save UPS $$$ you will not get credit as Amazon logs the return based on UPS labels.Anyway, I highly recommend the product for stability on a 14"" band saw and a shaper. I hope to get the 3rd unit shipped after I get out of return purgatory, but by that time I'll probably have paid for 4 or 5."
4,this is a film that leaves you speechless,"this is a gorey and dark film with a good plot.this is how i shall rate this filmplot 5/5- an old fling returns from the dead and wants his brothers wife to help him be human again by the blood of others.meanwhile hes brothers daughter finds her undead uncle and her step mom helping him by killing others for him.she finds the puzzle box and enters into the world of hellwhere she offers pinhead her uncle instead of her.beacuse her uncle had essacpt from pinhead.acting 4/5gore- 5/5rated R for graphic violence,nudity,sexual contentsome language"
4,Hellraiser,"Hellraiser is a surprisingly entertaining film. The production values of its time far surpass most other flicks in its genre, making it a very unique movie during its time. Unfortunately, Hellraiser is somewhat dated, as its numerous sequals demonstrate with enhanced special effects and CG. Hellraiser will remain a classic, but it should be considered for a re-make. With recent technological developments, it would be an excellent creation."
1,1 star out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A movie that fails on basically every level (aside from its inspired makeup), Hellraiser is beloved because of its high gore levels and sexual violence, not because of its characters, plot, plausibility (for a movie, not real life), acting, or any other measure of a good film."
1,Why again the R Version,"Two decades ago i bought Hellraiser on Laserdisc with a R rating, but on special features they had the two cutted scenes in it.On DVD i guess where 3 different releases, but all with the R rating.I`d hoped on Blue comes the Unrated version.Now i see it is hopeless,I like the movie very much but they dont get any money from me, for a R RATED version. I am sorry."
3,Clive Barker's Hellbound Heart adeptation is fairly good,"After reading Clive Barker's novel The Hellbound Heart(Hellraiser's inspiring story)before watching Hellraiser I've noticed many discrepancies between the two, and id say the novel is better. However if you haven't read the book I believe you'll enjoy this movie(despite some weak acting). I don't want to summarize the movie but I will say it is twisted and disturbing even up to today's standards. The DVD set is fairly solid and the visuals have been improved. It contains one disc with the widescreen movie(93 minutes), 5 interviews(ea. about 15 mins), theatrical and TV trailers, Commentary, a slide show, and first and final screenplays. Overall its worth buying, but READ THE NOVEL AFTER WATCHING HELLRAISER."
1,Huge Disappointment!,"This movie was totally ridiculous! Nothing scary at all! Gruesome? Yes, but that's just gross NOT scary. The wife barely even says a word in the movie and the acting had alot to be desired. Sorry Clive, but I'd say pass on this one!"
3,Entertaining and Informative,"I purchased this book after reading City of Djins. While there is no doubt that the latter is much more interesting and well written, In Xanadu is equally entertaining and informative. Fortunately I read most of it while traveling which was an additional point. It is definitely a good read, if not the best."
5,college kids delight,"There is nothing better than a comic strip to take your mind of work for a while, and Red & Rover accomplish thisw task with flying colors... One of the best since Calvin and Hobbes"
3,1970 Saucer Memories,"I remember watching these kind of films in High School in the late 60s and early 70s. When I watched them back then they were pretty believable and many people took these films very seriously. Watching them now 40 plus years later is fun. Its great to look back in the late 60s to see how UFO mysteries have changed the last 40 years. Would recommend this 3 movie dvd set on that premise alone. The UFO Toy Commercials are fun as well because I remember these toys when I was young, and its great to recall toys from the past. Wish I still had them."
1,Pet Safe PUL-275,Like a lot of other reviews I am having problems with pet safe PUL-275 collar and low battery light flashing. I bought an extra set of 2 batteries and the light still flashes showing low battery. Pet Safe sent me a new collar and it still does the same thing showing low battery even with the new batteries and the battery that came with the collar. They are sending me a 3rd collar and will report on how it is doing soon. I asked the guy from pet safe if they were having problems with this collar or batteries and he said this was the first he had heard of problems..WARNING Keep your receipt of PURCHASE for any warranty work.
4,PetSafe In-Ground Deluxe Ultralight Collar,"The collar works well. I had to replace an older version that stopped working - after about 9 years or so. The new one works great with the fence we already had in the ground. It would have been nice if it took some standard batteries, but there are some pretty reasonably priced places to buy them."
2,GRAINY DVD... PLAYS LIKE VHS,"MJ IS THE ""KING OF POP"" AND ALL THESE VIDEOS ARE GREAT! BUT, BUYER BEWARE: THE DVD IS EXTREMELY GRAINY. THE VHS THAT I'M SUPPOSE TO REPLACE IS BETTER QUALITY THAN THIS DVD."
5,Michael is the King of Pop,"This dvd is excellent!! My friends and I constantly dance along to it and we play it in slow motion to learn the dance steps. It has a lyrics feature so you can learn all the words to the songs. A lot of the classic songs are on it like Billie Jean, Beat it, Bad, and Remember the time. I only hope that a History Volume III is in the making. I LOVE Michael Jackson so I may be a little biased, but this dvd is definately worth owning if only just to marvel at the moonwalk done right!!"
5,Worth every penny,This DVD sure brings me back to my High School Days. I loved watching all the old plus the newer stuff from Micheal Jackson. I love every single short movie especially the Thriller one. Worth every penny. Great for Collection.
5,Children love them!,Received one of these as a gift a long time ago. Have given them many times and children just love them.
5,Mind blowing; wake up call,Purchased for a friend who found it to be awesome and awakening for the African American people.
4,Some People Just Don't Get It,"I have to applaud Spike for making this film. People can argue if he is a racist or not, but on this film he showed how corporate America market their products to black inner city people. I for one used to work in a marketing department at a large corporation and this type of behavior went on all the time. So many times, I had to smile and walk away when I heard ""you people"" and ""those people like stuff like that"". What is worst is some black artists (namely rappers) help build on these negative stereotypes. They are NO different from the black actors of the 30s who was paid to demean their race. Instead of black people getting mad at Spike for making these films, I suggest you take your anger out on the real culprits and their marketing schemes. BTW, these culprits come in ALL RACES."
5,THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE,BAMBOOZLED IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FILMS IN CINEMA HISTORY. IT'S SPIKE LEE'S BEST WORK THAT DEALS WITH ALL THE CARICATURES BLACKS HAVE BEEN MADE INTO(WHICH UNFORTUNATLEY IS STILL WITH US) AND THROWS EVERYTHING BACK INTO THE FACES OF WHITE AMERICA WHO THOUGHT OF THESE DEPICTIONS AND IMAGES SO ENTERTAINING. ALSO DEALS WITH HOW BLACKS WHO NEED MONEY WILL DO ALMOST ANYTHING EVEN IF IT DEHUMANIZES THEIR OWN RACE. THE MONTAGE AT THE END BRINGS ME TO TEARS BUT ALSO MAKES ME SICK TO MY STOMACH THAT ANY HUMAN BEING WOULD PARTICIPATE IN DEGRADING AND DEHUMANIZING A RACE OF PEOPLE.
3,Too easily disconnected,It would be helpful if the interior of female portion of the item was made of a more flexible material so that a more secure connection could be made. Ideally you would have a rigid exterior and a softer interior.
2,A waste of money,I was hoping that this would save some time by not having to attach clamps each time I switched to a different machine. That has not been the case. The fit on most of my machines is not good. The connector simply slips off after a few seconds. I would reiterate what another reviewer said about wrapping the port with some duct tape. I did that on my planer and it seemed to help. I've gone back to taking 10 seconds and tightening the clamp each time I move to a different machine. This wasn't worth the headache for me.
1,Father Ted is a Loser,"I HATE FATHER TED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And all those silly little Irish TV shows. Actually, this one was broadcast in England, but I hate it just the same. Father Ted is a total loser and a wimp. I hate everything about him."
2,Disappointing,"It is a shame that a subject so neglected in young children's literature is presented here in a confusing and somewhat directionless manner.The author's use of ""piggies"" who meditate (instead of people) seems to ""dumb down"" the ideas in order to make it appealing to youngsters. The assumption seems to be that kids are not smart enough and/or not be interested enough to hear about how humans use and find peace through meditative techniques.The text also over-generalizes the ideas and although there are slighly more lengthy explanation pages at the end of the book, there is still a tone of being talked down to which is a real turn-off.Peaceful Piggy Meditation may have its place within a larger teaching unit on prayer, meditation, and self-awareness but the book does not, unfortunately, stand alone as instruction for what meditation is and how to use it, nor is it a stand alone ""storybook."""
4,Fantasy fans--alert!,"Action, adventure, fantasy, romance--PLUS a strong-willed female protagonist.....what more can a girl want? Well, for starters, it would have been nice to have a real juicy villain to sink my teeth into. Lorra and her dad as the villainous pair seem to lack something in the altogether evil department, y'know? Nevertheless, a ripping good yarn, with characters you come to care for. The writing is fluent, the plot just pelts along and the characterization is deftly-handled. The ending was left sort of hanging so guess I'll have to hold my breath till the sequel."
3,This book puts insomniacs to sleep,Shouldn't a great novel be enjoyable to the reader? This is the most boring novel I have ever wasted time on. Admittedly the prose was beautiful. But if you merely want to read a bautiful flow of words read a Burns poem.Maybe the aristocracy of Britain in the 1920's loved this book but it is not woth reading today.
4,A Different Kind of Fiction,"I chose to read this book for a class when I was sixteen because a friend complained about it and said it was the most boring book in the world. I wondered if perhaps I might see something in it that she was missing.What a found was a very enjoyable literary style - this was my first exposure to ""stream-of-consciousness"" writing. I enjoyed the author's complex 3rd person omniscient shifting of perspectives through the various characters in the tale. The style had great affinity with my own very analytical and philosophical yet aesthetic mind at the time. I read this book not for an exciting plot; but, for the beauty in the writing itself. The themes in it were very abstract - such as the subject of being genuine and the like. ""To the Lighthouse"" has a very reflective quality about it. This book is certainly not for everyone; but, it is beyond a doubt a masterpiece for its kind."
1,Tedious - loved by Eastern critics; hated by readers,"I knew I was in trouble when I read the L-O-N-G run on sentences that clogged up reading flow in just the first two pages. No one talks like that. No one thinks like that. And no one writes like that except for pretentious authors beloved by academics who have no idea what interests people outside of moldy ivory towers. Virginia Woolf committed suicide. All the more reason to avoid this book lest the contagion of her world view infect your mind and depress you. This is a dated, pretentious, dry, irrelevant novel. I am asuming that it is being pushed because it is poilitically correct to have at least one female author in the great books list. Unfortunately, this is a dead author whose works should have been allowed to die with her rather than be immortalized. In fact, while Woolf was contemplating suicide, she should have destroyed her work along with her life in a big bonfire. That would have spared us this novel that I wasted money on."
5,One of the best books I ever read.,"One of the best books I ever read. Amazing description of what goes on in people's heads. Very insightful in the way children think and feel.I love the backdrop of the vacation beach house and how the family and the guests get on. I lot of thick description of the beautiful garden, the bay. Not a book for action-lovers."
5,Virginia Woolf's remarkable artistry,One of the great texts of modernist literature with extraordinary apercus on the problems of artistic creation and the ephemeral yet enduring quality of human relationships.
2,Boooooring,This book would have been tolerable had it been more straightforward. Ms. Wolfe goes overboard with her stream of consiousness style. She goes out of her way to not say what needs to be said which is egotistical and makes for a very disappointing book.
1,tedious,"basically James Joyce did the one day of introspection thing and showed that a) he was a clever bugger, and b) this kind of book is not an enjoyable read. so then Vwoolf does the same thing with a second-rate bunch of tedious people. hmm.bet that will prove fascinating. it does. not.god knows why everyone runs around pretending this turgid nonsense is great literature -- maybe wanting to be pseudo-intellectual? bloomsbury is like the cancer of British literature, and as this year's Pultizer was won by a Woolfie-book, maybe its contagious. Beware, o American brethren, this foul stuff has already laid waste to the country of Shakespeare et al."
1,"Bumblin', stumblin', fumblin'.","I see Woolf's point. I understand what she was doing and saying. But it was poorly executed. Every bit of it from beginning to end.She can't hold a single thought or development for long enough to make me care about anything. The writing seems to have been a toy for the writer, and not at all a serious attempt at a novel. As another reviewer stated, Woolf does give us a few glances at some great phrasings and story possibilities, but then she stamps it all out and moves on to something, anything, else. Just so long as the story never becomes interesting. God forbid."
2,Confusing on audio,Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me.
2,"""Along the stream of consciousness"" with a few rocks","This book came highly recommended from someone who shares the same affinity for the stream-of-consciousness style of writing as myself. However, I found that this book suffered from a lot of repetition and evantually that monotony just got under my skin.This book does have great moments but these are countered by the dull ones."
1,Others have already said it . . . and said it better,"""To the Lighthouse"" is the dullest novel I have ever read. But I should also make clear that I very much like Virginia's Woolf's essays, books like ""A Room of One Own,"" ""Three Guineas,"" and her other non-fiction."
5,Great cheesy martial arts fun,"I am a huge fan of Chuck Norris' movies before his Walker TV show. A Force of One was a title that was hard to find, either on DVD or VHS, and in the last 10 years, has only been shown on cable TV where I live once.This is a film about a karate master (Norris) enlisted by the local PD to teach some narcotics cops karate, because a ""karate killer"" is killing off cops that get too close to a drug ring.It's great to see a pre-mustache and beard Norris. I think this was movie geared more toward exposing the public to who Norris was, and what karate was all about. There's really no story or thick plot, or even interesting characters, but -- this is a Chuck Norris movie! Good movie to kill a Saturday afternoon on."
3,Great picture while it lasted,"I purchased this TV for use primarily for use with a PS3 and was mostly pleased. Nice picture, intuitive displays, effective remote, nice input availability, etc.Unfortunately, after a few months it began to smoke and let out a strong smell of burning plastic. Fortunately, it was still within the allowed return period. I am not sure whether or not Olevia brand televisions frequently require repair so early, but personally would not risk buying another Olevia TV without an extended warranty."
2,The price is higher than retail price in CVS/Walgreens,"The price per can works out to be higher than what it is in CVS/Walgreens stores. They are selling it for 14 dollars only. Why you guys are asking for 92 dollars for 6-pack, which means it will be around 15.3 dollars?"
1,no savings,"I signed up for the mom discount and came here to order this formula for my premie baby. 6 cans for 100$. However ive been to walmart, target, walgreens, and cvs, and the price difference is only 2 dollars more at those stores and I dont have to wait for shipping. I am unclear how this is a saving to the moms on the prime account. I wouldnt suggest buying it from the site."
1,You have got to be kidding,"I'm not much for rap, but do appreciate talent in the genre. This ""debut"" has everything BUT talent. The ""judge"" sounds scared during his raps, as if maybe he should have practiced them more. The music is tired and regardless of obvious influences, he could have at least tried something original. Attempting to shock the audience with foul language does not make you an artist.Take some music and writing lessons judge.....then you can have a say."
3,"It was ok, it just lets you know ties can become stronger",It's a good showing how clubs can become one either when both are trying to get people to join their clubs.
3,Mosby's 2000 Nursing Drug Cards,"As a nursing student required to purchase this set, I found the cards much easier than writing out med cards by hand. On the other hand, I was frustrated to find some meds I needed not included in the set, or the use I was looking for not mentioned. The box is convenient, but the cards are so tightly packed it is difficult to get at them, causing me to divide them between two index file boxes, making it less convenient to carry to clinical settings."
4,Sevendust- Animosity,"First off, to respond to the reader from WA, you can't write a bad review for a book because you're not familiar with their tunings, well you can but it makes you look like an idiot. The strings are tuned down for the low, crunchy sound; and they are not floppy if you strum them the right way. Also, if you're just starting out, eventhough i know all you fans love and wanna play like Sevendust, their solos and progression are just too advanced for beginners, so you do need some guitar knowledge. Otherwise, this guitar book is like any other: musical notes, tabs underneath, lyrics placed for you, and all the notations. Best tracks: Shine, X-Mas Day, and Angel's Son."
1,HATE IT!!!,"Just like many of the other reviewers - I HATE THIS MACHINE! Even my child asked to have ""our old TiVo"" back! This experience is bad enough to turn me off to DirecTV completely (I've been a customer for over 10 years!!). DO NOT get this machine!! Doesn't matter if it is free! It is better to pay for a TiVo that actually works well."
3,Ann Margaret has a 12 cylinder co-star,"Besides Ann Margaret and her Italian co-star, it has a beautiful metallic blue Ferrari, either a 330 GTC or Super America. It would be a 1966 or 67 model. I will wait until the price of the DVD goes down a bit."
1,He sounds like Kermit the Frog on crack!!!,"I ain't never got the Hype Behind Pharrell Williams at all. decent Beat-maker,half hearted songwriter&cliched jacker producer at best. singing Wise He is like Kermit the Frog on crack.dude got a serious Frog in His throat when he does what He calls singing.tired of this Turkey doing a Poor Mockery of the Great Steve Arrington's Songs&Vocal Stylings. this song is Horrible.ain't no Hook,ain't no groove. ain't no singing or rapping here either. Gwen Stefani is riding on Madonna big time&sounds tired on here. She needs to go back to No Doubt ASAP to maintain some Creditable.this Song stanks."
1,Not expected !!!!! - I am under loss,"This laptop does not fit for 15.4 inch laptops.I am saying this because, my laptop TOSHIBA S300-S2503 does not fit inside this bag.I can say that, I am under loss...If possible please take back this item and re-fund me the amount paid."
3,"Somewhat disappinting, but it's still Betty","This DVD contains five shorts starring Betty Page. There is no nudity on the DVD. The quality of the shorts is poor, but that's due to the low quality of the original films, so there's nothing to be done about it.What makes this disc disappointing is that it only runs about 30 minutes (even though the disc itself claims an hour length). In addition, the ""photo gallery"" consists of only three pictures--all from her high school years (i.e., uncopyrighted).What makes the disc worthwhile is, well, Betty. This might be a good disc for those unfamiliar with her work. If it turns out you don't like it you won't have wasted much time or money. Fans can get most of the shorts (and lots more) on Betty Page: Bondage Queen. Hard core fans will want it just to complete a collection."
5,Grandma and Grandson agree,Both Grandma (who bought the book) and Grandson (age 15) agreed the book was on the money and well worth the read.
1,the hobbit and lord of te rings,"I thought that this book was not that helpful. Instead of condensing the story chapter by chapter ( which I think is a good thing), the book condenses the whole story in one writing!for example;Lord of the rings/the fellowship of the ring. This book is split into: book one (3 pages) and book 2 (about 4 pages)"
1,Can't Choose Zero Stars,"Don't you dare. Take an F or the read the books. The Lord of the Rings has been chosen as the best book of the 20th century. This isn't Shakespeare or some obscure book that only English majors read, this is Tolkien and you will be hooked after 20 pages of the Hobbit. READ THE BOOKS."
1,A dreadful book,"The writing is so bad, it is painful to read. I gave up after a chapter -- and I was looking for entertainment, not great literature. Read Eric Ambler and forget Grisham."
3,"Good Plot, But Grisham Lacks Any Real Writing Talent","This is the first Grisham book I have read and I am in the middle of it. I find the plot enjoyable, but the writing is stale, the charachters are poorly developed and the description, what little there is, leaves quite a bit to be desired. The story line is enjoyable and if this was writen by someone else with more skill for writiing, I would think it should be a wonderfull book. I like the aspect of espionage, but find the parts about the governmet layers boring. When the setting changes and Callahan enters the plot again, I don't mind reading. These chapters at least have a few semi-well developed characters and it is not a whole bunch of boring lawyer drible. In fact I rather like Callahan's character, but he plays a bit of a minor role in the plot so far. Well I won't bore you any more, you'll have to make your own call on this one, if you like a strong plot and don't mind bad writing, you would probably like this book"
2,oh well...,Best-seller? yeah. But it's BORING! I had to force myself to finish it. Cuz I'm not used to giving up in the middle. But I found this book totally boring.
1,Garbage doesn't deserve a Review,"If there was a catgory for 0 stars, I would have selected that. It's depressing to realize that truly great modern literature is not being read by people today. Instead they read this boring trash and think they are reading a book by a great author. As a high school teacher, I am disturbed that great books are not being published any longer and that movies are actually being made using the garbage that is being published. I couldn't finish this book. About 2/3's of the way through when I had figured out the end, I asked my husband (who had read the entire book), if there wasn't really a surprise ending. He said ""no"", and that I had figured it out. All I could think of was what was all the hoopla about. I didn't waste anymore time reading ""Pelican Brief"" and I guarantee you, I will never read another of his books. It's definately 8th grade mentality."
3,Very loose plot,"Unlike what I had expected, the plot was very loose. Hard to believe that trained FBI agents could not catch Darby, President begs to drop the investigation, etc. Not upto the mark!"
3,Better then some other books I've read,"This book wasn't bad,and it wasn't that great. The book was streched way too long. But the plot was good. These two supreme judges were killed by the same person, and this woman wrote a brief on who she thought did it. She gives it to her lab professor, who hands it over to a FBI lawyer. When the professor later is killed by a car bomb, the woman, whose name is Darby, flees. When the same FBI Lawyer chases after her to protect her, he is killed also. Then Darby calls a reporter, and they team up to unmask the killer. This was a pretty decent book, better than some of John's other books. I recommend you read this book."
3,Grisham did a decent job,"This novel is much like the rest of Grisham's works. The character development is good throughout the novel, but the plot remains pretty much the same. it was the typical struggle between government and the people.Personally, I thought the novel was pretty good. I do believe he has done better. I also think that if you've ever seen the movie, and didn't especially like the ending, you should read the book."
1,The entire story is based on an erroneous premise,"This novel makes no sense. A law student does some research and looks up some information in the public records and writes a summary of her findings. OK now this information is , through a lot of contrivance, turned over the FBI. Conveniently, the head of the FBI wants to hang the President out to dry. I can live with all of the contrivance up to this point in the story; but, once the brief is turned over to the FBI, they have all of the information the law student had and stronger motivation to hang the President, so why kill the student? And why write a whole novel about attempts to kill her?"
4,The pelican bried,"The Pelican Brief is about how two Supreme Court justices who get murdered on the same night, and why they were murdered. A law student named Darby writes a brief explaining why the two judges were killed. Darby's brief which started out as just a crazy idea ends up hitting it spot on. So now she's on the run for her life. The book gets a little confusing with all the characters and all the information it sometimes hard to keep up. Overall it was a good read. If you like fast pace books with plenty of information the Pelican Brief is the book for you!"
5,Beatrix Potter is hilarious,"We've been reading Beatrix Potter to our infant at bedtime - I'm not sure that she appreciates the books as much as her father and I do (illustrations are small and subdued). The story is seriously funny - almost deadpan at some points - and I love the illustrations of the fierce bad rabbit. I also read this to a 6 year old visitor to our place and she didn't seem overly impressed. In sum, only time will tell whether our daughter will grow to love Potter but we certainly are enjoying ourselves."
3,better?,"It is easy to see that the delta, jet and powermatic jigs are basically the same. I bought this one for my new jet supersaw because it looked better finished.Two problems: 1. I used the left-most mounting position for the miter slide, but it does not position the clamping face close enough to the blade! This jig is made for a table with closer spacing between the miter slot and blade. I ""fixed"" by putting 1.5 inches of wood on the clamping face. Of course this will lead to other problems/limitations.2. the adjustment screws for the miter slot T width are frozen. I stripped out one socket screw trying to loosen. The delta service center in Portland said they would send a replacement. It is too soon to judge whether it will arrive or not since this happened last week.I do like the placement of the handles. the side-positioned handles encourage me to move to the side instead of leaning over the table as I push a piece through."
1,Tendoning Jig doesn't Fit Table Saw!,"The tendoning jig doesn't fit my Craftsman table saw!! I have written the seller, Temberline, numerious times. I was finally told to grind the washers off that are located at the end of the guide. This will void any warranty. I have asked for other solutions several more times and have not received a reply. Now I have been requesting a return authorization, and still with no reply.This seems to be a great tool but is usless to me without a proper solution to fitting it to my table saw.I have jst purchased a Delta mortising jig that works fine.David E. Formby"
1,POS,"I bought this for a Delta contractors saw. Of course it came with the track slide in the wrong position, so I had to disassemble it and move the slide. When I put it back together using the supplied Allen wrench, the set screw for the adjustment handle stripped. Then I discovered that the jig has too little travel to make tenons in thin material, which was what I needed it to do. I'm throwing away this useless POS and buying the Jet."
1,A word of warning before you buy,"I recently purchased the DELTA tenoning jig from Amazon. When I received it, it was immediately obvious that the base plate was seriously warped and would not sit flat upon my table saw, or even my bench. I found the part number in the booklet provided and called Delta to ask them to send me a replacement. To my surprise, Delta said that THEY DO NOT PROVIDE PARTS FOR THIS ITEM. Their suggestion was that I return the jig to the store where I bought it and to TRY another one. Well I returned it alright - than you Amazon for your courtesy and efficiency in handling the return - but I was not about to buy a product for which I could not get parts. So I bought a tenoning jig from General and am very happy with it."
3,worked but could be better,"i was changing front brake pads on a 2004 mercury monterey. in order to get the tool into the 2 piston without disassembling two more bolts i had to bust the black handle off with a hammer. then i could slip it through the caliper holes and tighten it down with a pair of vise grips on the end. worked good then. if it was designed without a handle and the end made to use with a socket and ratch wrench, it would fit many more calipers"
4,Sigma does it right,"I've been using Sigma bike computers for about 5 years now. I buy the wired, less expensive ones that only supply the basics (Speed, Ave. Speed, ODO, Trip ODO, Time)and then buy a new one when a wire breaks or the battery dies. This model is a good one except it doesn't calculate average speed (which is think is dumb). I installed it on my beater bike and am purchasing another one to install on my primary bike. It will be a Sigma. I like Sigma and they're intuitive to use."
2,Disappointing...,"Was wanting to duplicate my Moody Blues LP collection with digital releases. This new ""jazzed up"" digital version is disappointing. Something has changed... the vocals aren't the same as what I heard on my LPs. The sound flat where it once soared."
1,He took unto himself an orange...,Deep man.... if you're 13... and high.Psych 101. Grow up and forget this group.
1,can't be filled,"After finally getting the yellow funnel off, you still can't open it far enough to put anything in it. I gues you are suppose to submerge it to fill it. I threw it in the recycling bin."
2,"Nice gas can, but Amazon sent damaged product","There is no doubt this is a quality made product. It blows away the so called ""EPA"" plastic cans that have been forced upon us. However, the can Amazon sent me had a large dent near the handle along with chipped paint. There was no damage to the box that I received it in so it is virtually impossible that it was damaged during shipping. See uploaded photos. There is another review of a similar product from the same manufacturer that mentions a very similar dent. Maybe Amazon is selling factory seconds? Amazon conveniently won't accept returns on this product so I am stuck with it. I will buy another one of these cans in a larger capacity but not from Amazon!"
5,Addictive Gameplay,"Awesome game, they really nailed the single player. The play experience is very different than the standard sci-fi shooters. The multi-player powerups (helicopter, airstrike, etc) feel a little skewed toward the better players, but that may just be my inexperience. Very addictive gameplay, great in-game leaderboards, thoughHalo 3has them completely beat in the out-of-game stat tracking. That would be my only complaint thus far, oh and maybe having the Javelin in online multiplayer would be nice too...heh."
5,The best FPS to date,"This is one of the first games to credibly blur the line between reality and fantasy in the world of first person shooters. The situations are so intense, the characters so gritty, you can't help but get lost in the game. It is a truly immersive experience where you feel the grit of the sand, the mud under your boots and smell the cordite in the air. The maps may have one way through, but the complexity of each op makes them truly challenging, with multilayered threats constantly presenting a more engaging level of complexity to the experience. Hard core shooters will love the variety of weapons, locales and mission profiles, and the fact that the actors have snappy dialogue that is spot on for the mission. The only drawback is that eventually you will have to stop to eat."
5,call of duty 4,"it is awsome, i've never played video games before, but my two sons convinced me to try it and i had to order me one when i came to iraq. i have alot of fun with this game.thanksSGT. BOBBY PHILLIPSSOME WHERE IN IRAQ"
4,"Nice looking, fun, but not perfect","This is a great game, Better than cod3 , there have been many improvements in graphics since cod3, I wish there where vehicles for the online play but I can live without hopefully we will see that in cod5, but we are now starting to see what the 360 can do when talking about graphics, True multilayer is a little complicated at first but you will get the hang of it eventually, sort of similar to halo, I personally will take halo 3 over cod3 any day but that is just my opinion, I recommend this title if you are a fan of fps games, and if you liked cod3, or halo 3 you will love this title. Please go out and buy it, and I recommend getting it from amazon, but if you choose not to get it from them, I would highly recommend target as they offer a year warranty in case something happens to it, I purchased it from gamestop, but I bought halo 3 and my 360 from target about a month ago. JUST GO OUT AND BUY IT!!!"
5,Great Game,"This is speaks for itself. You've seen the trailers, read the reviews, heard the rumors. Try it. You'll like it, I promise. Unless you hate video games, then and only then you might not. (But seriously, who DOESN'T like video games???) Anyway, I digress. This is definitely worth the money.P.S>Only downside? No Co-op Multiplayer missions mode Offline. BUT Online play more than makes up for it."
4,Excellent graphics - game too short,"Amazing graphics. Havent seen an xbox game having graphics as realistic as this one. Loved it. However, would have been even better had the game been longer than what it is right now :-)"
3,Velvet Revolver - Libertad,"As a long time fan of Stone Temple Pilots AND Guns 'n Roses, I was excited to learn that members of both groups had amalgamated to form Velvet Revolver. Their first albumn I thought was their best, with strong vocals from Scott Weiland and impeccable guitar solos from Slash. This is their 2nd album and I think I need to hear it a few times perhaps for it to 'grow on me'. Stone Temple Pilots had the right mix, excellent song writing and vocals, perhaps 'Revolver' would benefit from different song writers? I didn't feel that Weiland's strong vocal ability was particularly utilized in this new offering."
3,Undecided and somewhat dissapointed,"I loved, loved, loved VR's first album from the first listen to everytime I play it today. This one I am not so sure about. It really just did not catch my ear....not one songs seems to stand out from the rest. Is it the curse of the sophomore slump!! I hope the next CD they put out is better than this one....come on Scott I know you can write better songs than these.And what's up with doing a cover of an ELO song.....bad choice for a really hard rockin band like this.....beside what did they do run out of creative energy! Oh hey I know lets throw in a lame cover song to fill the cd....very dissapointing. If I wanted to listen to an ELO song I would just listen to one of their CD's. Give me a break!!!!"
3,Libertad good,The followup to Contraband is good. I am sure it will grow on me more the longer I lisen to it
4,So Ya Need Even More Velvet Revolver...Eh?,"First of all, I whole-heartedly agree with everyone who gave this album a 4 or 5 Star Rating. It does Rock. Let's just hope it keeps getting some good Radio Air-play to let EVERYONE Know that Rock & Roll is still Alive! Although, I'm sure the next single will be one of the ""ballads"". Just wait and see.Now, while you are busy ripping these new tracks to your iPod, or making a copy for the car, don't forget about an extra track that the band did for the Fantastic 4 movie soundtrack in 2005. It's called ""Come On, Come On"". It's on the Fantastic 4 - The Album. Track No. 1. It's a straight up Rock song, that will fit in with either Contraband or the new Libertad cd. Check it out."
4,Took a few listens!,"When I first put this cd in and checked it out, I was disappointed at what I heard. Nothing really stood out from the get go. I really liked the guitar lick in tune number two, but other than that it seems to be lacking something. However after about the 4th or 5th spin, I really started to get into it and now am pretty pleased with what on here. Yeah it's nothing ground breaking or earth shattering, but it's good straight ahead hard rock which is something I do enjoy a lot.If you liked the first one?, you'll probably grow to like this one as well as it's pretty much a carbon copy of the first outing."
4,Exactly what I wanted. Exactly what I expected.,"I couldn't get enough of Contraband. That album just rocked. There were some change of pace songs in there, including ""Fall to Pieces"" which is arguably the best song the VR has done.This disc is different enough that any ""formulaic"" accusations do not stick but it's similar enough that I get what I expect. The first track, ""Let it Roll"" is about as perfect an opening for a CD as can be expected. ""She Builds Quick Machines"" grooves with the best of them, plus you can really crank it. I could put this disc on in the car and drive to and from work for weeks. The real strength of this group is that they work together so well. It's not just Slash's solos or Scott's vocals, but it's the overall sound that makes them great.If anything, I'd say that it was too long a wait, but it was worth it."
4,This is what Rock n Roll is about,"On their second album, Velvet Revolver bring rock back to where it belongs, crunchy rhytym guitars, pirecing leads, with a hard driving beats and Weiland sounding better than ever. Perfect mix of power, talent, and attitude. It blows the first one away, hands down.It's as if what ever fell short, or ""didn't work"" the first time out, works now. The songs are stronger, and the band is playing better. Whatever their appoach was, it worked. No gimmics, no bull. These guys do what you want them to do on this record, they rock!My personal favs right off the bat, ""Let it Roll"", ""She builds quick machines"", ""For a brother"", ""Spay"".I agree it's probably the best record this year, so far. It a pleasure to hear a record by a real ""band"". They blend together wonderfully, each song allows each member to shine in their own right. But, as it should be, the song comes first.If you are a fan , buy it now, you won't be dissapointed."
2,Want GNR or STP ? ?,"If you want GNR, buy the 1st CD and Use Your Illusions I+II. If you want STP, buy their 1st 3 CD's. If you want the last song on Libertad, buy the new Travelling Wilburys. But, above all, buy the 1st Velvet Revolver and don't waste your time with this.By the way VR's CD's can't touch any of the above. You know how 2nd CD's go.......D"
3,Pretty funny,"This VeggieTales album has great songs. They're really funny, as are all VeggieTales things. The songs are good, and they have good moral lessons. Good for long car rides. None of them are too dumb that you won't want to sing along. Well, maybe your parents won't, but what did you expect? They're adults! They might get embarrassed. (In front of who?) Anyway, it's a great album, and it has the printed lyrics inside the sleeve, so you can sing if you don't know all the words. Awesome."
1,Don't waste your money...,These batteries are junk. I bought the driver and saw kit and the hammer drill kit. In the first year I replaced the drill/drivers three times...while under warranty. The saw worked well and the flashlight was the best part of this kit. Now it is a couple years old and the batteries are dead and at $90 each I am not replacing them. They were not used that often and I took care to cycle them throughly when charging. I bought Hitachi this time with a five year warranty. I wasted $600 on the Porter Cable junk.
5,The Best Rap Out There!!!!,"I think everyone should buy this CD, because Six Shot is a Rapper who knows how to keep it real!!! He gives it to you straight, no beating around the bush!! He is the best!!! One day he is gonna be bigger than Juvenile, DMX, and every other rapper out there!!!IF you have it great, if you don't buy it because you don't know what you are missing!!!!!!!"
5,9th Wonder is the greatest!,"hip hops best cd of the decade this cd is flawless and shows that you dont have to rap about stabbing people in your forehead or cookin up crack or on the corner hustling every minute this cd is dope peroid there is nothing else to say other then it should be in your possesionFavorite Track: All of Them!Members:Big Pooh,Phonte & 9th Wonder10 of 10 lyrics 10 of 10 beats"
3,0 *'S IF 9TH DIDNT DO THE BEATS,"C'mon, people lets look @ the big picture here. 9th wonder is one of the best producers in the game right now, theres no question about that. But my problem with this album is that Fonte', and Big Pooh (and Big Pooh has to be the dumbest moniker ever used) rarely spit anything close to ill. Same ol same ol, lyrical wise, but as far as the beats nearly all of them are spectacular. I wouldn't necessarily say this isn't worth buying, the beats alone are worth the $, but don't expect to hear anything mind blowing from these 2 average MC's."
1,surprisingly terrible,"I have been a major fan of Black Adder for a long, long time. I was overjoyed to hear that there was a new episode. How utterly disappointing it is. It is pleasantly nostalgic, nice to see them all back together again, but it is thoroughly unfunny. It had the characters, but lacked the wit, cleverness, and j'n'sais pas. In my experience, British comedies tend to be either very very good or very very bad. Black Adder was always firmly ensconced on the good side. This reunion episode is entirely on the bad side of the line.Still, it is nice to see them all back together again, so for a real fan of Black Adder, it is probably worth buying. Just don't expect to be laughing very hard while you watch it."
4,Foyle's War: Set 2 Review,"This is a very enjoyable series that is getting better & better as we go along. It is very authentic & well done. Not very much hardcore activity, but very likeable characters and interesting mysteries."
5,Wonderful,Heard about the series from brother - he was right - it's a blend of police work with WWII events intruding.
5,"Perhaps, one of his best CDs","Every song in here is blessed, fun and catchy. Love it! But then again, I am a big fan of his work. .-)jic"
2,Just a Black and Decker in different skin,"Before I found out the fact Porter-Cable/Delta had been to sold to B&D;, I found Porter-Cable tools to be of high quality, and very reliable. Alas, the future is quite dark for Porter/Cable loyalists. For now you will get no more than grown up toys not a high quality professional tool Porter-Cable was famous for. Now though instead of replacing my Porter-Cable tools with more Porter-Cable, I will look elsewhere for the same level of quality.Do not get me wrong, once upon a time B&D; made very good power tools, but in the last 15 years or so I have found them suspect, even the more jazzed up DeWalt, so called porfessional tool, is not what it once was. What a mess."
4,"Not bad, especially for the price.","got these to wear at work so I could concentrate. Decent sound, and they still allow some outside noise in, so hey, good for work. Don't buy if you are looking for complete isolation."
2,Coby CV320,The headband (it is adjustable) cracked and one of the volume controls became noisy. The sound is good and it's very comfortable.
3,SO-SO,They're headphones... a decent inexpensive substitute for earbuds if you're like me and they kinda hurt in there lol. They do not get very loud and the bass is actually unimpressive but for the price you cant complain too much =)
3,its alright,"whenver i walk with it it loosens out of my ear, always have to tuck it in frequently. if youre not gonna move around w/ it much tne buy it, if not try to find something else."
1,Great tools but Lousy charger,"I have owned the Porter Cable 12 volt cordless drill for years and find it an excellent tool, BUT the battery chargers that come with them or replace the originals are terrible. I have had two of them fail -- they suddenly start showing that every battery connected to them is defective. I will never buy another PC cordless tool. A cordless tool, not matter how wonderful, without an adequate battery and charger system is worthless."
4,works as advertised,this product works as advertised. Im happy with it.seems just a tad slower to charge than the old one but still charges at a good rate and seems to put a stronger charge on your battery. tbd
5,best drum kit ever!!!!!(for begginers),now this drum set is a very good one that's a fact and i love jamming out on it when ever i can see im a guitar player and i don't play drums but man when i start playing i don't wanna stop so in short if you wanna get a cheap drum set worth the money buy this!!
1,I truly hated this book and would give it a zero if I could,"The writing style was so extraordinarily annoying that I found it virtually impossible to read. The few nuggets of good advice must be culled out of hackneyed, trite, tired attempts at wit. I found myself skimming the entire book searching for something worthwhile and find it was not worth the effort. If you were able to edit out the exasperating filler you might have the makings of a worthwhile magazine article."
2,The Builders,I bought this book and it does not match the book advertised. Mine has pages missing and all together isnt right...The book they sold me isnt the same as the advertised pictured book and the inside is all wrong. If I would have known I wasnt getting the book as described I would not have bought it. SNEAKY SELLER. But what can you do...a shot in the dark I reckon..Buyer beware...look carefully....before buying. And yes you can judge a book by its cover! First 2 pages are missing. They show an Index but my book has none. And my book is about 100 pages the book advertised is over 300 pages...go figure...is this false or tricky advertising? Thank you.
4,Good Concert,"In general is a good concert, the songs and performance is OK, it is a shame John Bush left the band.... Joey Belladonna doesn't have the strength as he use to....Cons... there is no more Anthrax DVD's like this one... I try but couldn't find it..."
3,For OLDER children!,"My 15 month old daughter received this as a gift from a friend. It looked great from the outside and seems very durable, but when we put it together, my daughter IMMEDIATELY started taking out ALL of the small pieces of each of the animals. I would say there is an average of 6 small pieces PER SQUARE! It is pretty difficult to tell which piece goes with which animal once they're all taken out. I'm putting it away and possibly never taking it out again because there are just TOO many pieces! Oh, and some of the pieces are quite small, so I would consider it a choking hazard for little ones (probably under 3)!"
2,complicated...,It's important to know that this floor puzzle has lots and lots and lots of little pieces- geared more toward three/five year old....
4,Big rats need extra cheese,This movie was the epitomy of 80's B movies. Good for a beer and a laugh. I especially loved the way the giant wasps on the ground were so obviously fake that you could see the hole where their heads came off.
5,Awesomely Bad,"I've never seen special effects quite like this....they were so bad they were awesome. The monster growling and the instant birth for that woman put it over the top. If you have a thing for awesomely bad movies, this is one for you!"
2,They work okay,"I was hoping these would be better than the ones I currently had. They work they same, which is good enough, but they are too big for my head. They keep slipping off my head:( Not much I can do about that...I just can't find head phones that fit me."
4,"Fair Price, But Don't Like Latches or Lack of ""Feet""","For the price, this is a nice little board. There are 2 issues in my opinion.1. The latches are longer than they should be and therefore hang lower than the board when in the open ""playing"" position. If you use the board on a nice wooden table you must leave the latches up or they will scratch the table surface.2. There are hinges on the board (of course) but there are no ""feet"" so when it is closed you really can't set it down like a briefcase because it sits on the hinges.If you like the game and don't want to spend a lot - I recommend this board. If you're concerned about the issues I mentioned you may want to keep looking. It's a keeper for me..."
5,Game with class that is educational and fun!,"The backgammon board/ attache, was a great purchase. My familly and I enjoy playing backgammon and other games with it. Nice sewing on the board, appears sturdy and long lasting."
5,Great Book of Quotations,"I love this little book of quotes. There is something for everybody, and something about everything."
5,Beautiful!,"Thomas Newman has this amazing power of drawing out the richest emotions with his music. Like everyone else said, it really makes you relive the movie. Go buy it!"
1,Very disappointed...,27 tracks. What are the odds. You figure half would be good or great. I found only 2 tracks that were good. Quantity over quality? More tracks does not equal better soundtrack. 2 for 27 is baaaaddddd! Bottom line... not a very great soundtrack.Great movie though.
1,Politically motivated fiction,"The book is fascinating, but now we know that it is completely untrue. None of the uranium enrichment facilities described by Hamzah have been found and the aluminum tubes he mentions were determined to be unsuitable for use in centrifuges by U.S. nuclear weapons experts.It is significant that Hamzah was brought to the U.S. by Ahmed Chalabi, who has been involved in the almost all of the ""defectors"" that we now know to be frauds. They had every incentive to lie: Hamzah gets fame, wealth and asylum and Chalabi gets to govern Iraq.Once you know the book is fiction, it makes a good read, though."
4,Nice Wheel,"I've been debating on buying a wheel for a long time , finally settled on this onebecause its backwards compatiable . It don't work as well as I thought it would fornfs under ground 2 ,most wanted and carbon as I hope it would.It works very well with burnout takedown,revenge,paradise city and midnight club l.a. The wheel works extremly well with dirt 2 but not with the original dirt.The main reason I only gave 4 stars is because the force feedback is a little weak. The fact that it isn't lap friendly was not a issue I made a frame to mount it on, and it works very well.I would recomened this wheel if you enjoy racing games"
3,Xbox 360 Logitech DriveFX,"The wheel is ok, it doesn't comeback like a normal steering wheel to the straight position."
1,Dont buy this wheel. The response really sux!,After some good reviews on this that i read - i went ahead and bought this wheel and i thought it was quite pathetic on several accounts.a) this has to be clamped to a table. its not comfortable to put on ur lap and play like the Microsoft Xbox360 wheel. So a simple couch play is not that fun anymore!!b) The response is pathetic. not only was the response slower than just the controller but it wasnt good on the force feedback either.I bought the wheel from best buy for a friend for xmas and she's returning it after just 1 use :(
5,Does what it advertised,"I really bought the Wet/Dry vac just for small things like leaves, crumbs, fur, stuff that always seems to wind up in my car but aren't major disasters. I love the vacuum; although I haven't tried to vacuum up any liquid I know it works great on the small stuff. Would definitely recommend, a little bigger than I thought so I keep it in the garage rather then in the car but still very convenient."
4,good bargain,"At the price paid for this, it is a real good deal. It basically pulls up the dirt and other stuff from the floor. I've given 4 star rating as it is not so powerful, but it basically does the job in a good manner. Cord is long to move it freely in the car."
2,I will NOT give Brian a break!,"I love a lot of Brian Wilson's work, too, and I'm glad that he's cranking the music out on a semi-regular basis again, but he's just composed too much good, transcendant music in the past that this entire CD just pales in comparison. The production is unfortunately uninspired and samey throughout, and the lyrics may mean something to Brian, but they strike me as bland and cookie-cutter. The inclusion of the remake ""Let Him Run Wild"" only underlines the fact that he has lost something vital--it reminds you of the magic that was the Beach Boys. I refuse to believe Brian doesn't still have it in him, but it's not to be found on this disc."
4,its broading the horizons,"its enlarged my horizon about the religions, their roots and the humanity. I can now visualize the existing of religionist issues and have more tolerance to other believes and thoughts. Before read this book, I was confusing about science, nations, spiritual life and humanity. Now I have many things to say. I strongly recommend this book everyone who wants to better understand social and psychological issues clearly and in a broad range. To understand the world better, and to have tolerance, people need such kind of books. Thanks volney for writing this book 100 yrs ego."
1,Sucks,Worst headphones ive ever purchased !!! they absolutely SUCKKK.! iVE PURCHASED MANY HEADPHONES ONLINE BUT THESE HEADPHONES IVE PURCHASED WERE THE WORST .!!
1,WORST.. DONT BUY...,it lasted 1 day. was unable to return d product also...DONT BUY AT ALL even if it's free..
2,Muzak,"Yet another example of two brilliant guitarists who have succumbed to the allure of the bland ""soundtrack to my life"" genre of elevator music. Makes me want to down a Valium or two and run to Walmart and cruise the aisles with this as background music. I don't know why these guys (yes I do: $$$$) have chosen to use their talents in the service of mall music. I defy you to listen to this stuff and Miles Davis in the same week without gagging..."
2,If you're looking for Gary Forney performing....,"....this ain't it. Most of the tunes are performed by David Fox...the guy in ""Off The Charts""."
3,Mew4Muse,"This series comes right after Gundam SEED. But BEWARE!!! This sequel is FULL of parodies of what happened in Gundam SEED. The main character Shinn can be very annoying and there were some major parts of the plot I thought were really ridiculous. I won't spoil it and say what those are, but I'm SERIOUSLY hoping the rumored Gundam SEED movie fixes these. One romance in particular got seriously screwed by whoever wrote the plot.I give the series a 3 because, despite all that, it was still pretty good. The animation is beautiful, the JAPANESE voice cast is fantastic and the music is great. (Except for the last opening credit, C'mon!)Not to mention it shows us our favorite characters from Gundam SEED and some of the amazing (and yes, some STUPID) things they do."
1,Poor workmanship in parts,Obvious low bidder type kit. Threads are poorly done and require lots of tape to seal. Most parts in the kit are not needed and the individual would be better served to buy what is really needed in an individual high quality part and not have a lot of left over parts of dubious quality.
3,Got what I paid for,"I must say that I got what I paid for. For only $1.98 not bad at all. The sound is clear and I am pretty satisfied with this product, I don't expect it to last long seeing how cheap it was but so far so good. It is pretty delicate so be gentle with it if you want it to last longer than average. I use it along with my Behringer mic for recording songs and it works fine."
1,mediocre while it worked,"ok for non-critical vocal listening, don't even consider for more than background muzak-type listening, lasted all of two days before left channel lost triggered by cord snag while walking. not built with durability to handle kid glove level abuse."
5,Great Headphones,"Got these for our son for Christmas. They work GREAT in the piano, we no longer have to hear the piano blaring as he plays. The only complaint I have about them is that they block the noise so efficiently, that he doesn't hear anyone talking to him... Guess that could be a good feature too! ;o)"
5,Bright and Distinctive,"Sunflowers is a distinctive fragrance that I find more floral-like than fruity. It is a strong, unique scent, but one that is likely to be wearable on many due its simplicity and appeal. My only complaint is that I wish the container was better made: the bottom is very narrow, and since the bottle is quite tall, it frequently falls over when I open and close my drawer."
2,Disappointment,I ordered a used book that I plan on using my first semester of college. I read the description of the book written by the seller and it said that only the cover had damage and that the pages had not been written in or highlighted. I was very disappointed once I opened the book and found that it in face had been written in and highlighted in. The cover had more than slight damage and the spine was in horrific condition. I will probably end up taping the spine of the book just so it can last me until the end of the semester. Not happy with the way it was described- the book isn't like the way it was described.
4,I don't think it is really bad at all..,"Ignore the author's disparaging remarks. This book is worth your dollars sheerly on talent alone. It does run through some unfocused spots, but for a debut novel this is great. Take the time to search out his short fiction, which is published in several avant-garde literary journals. He writes some clever satire (ie. Mephistopholes), etc."
2,read the fine print,I guess I didn't read carefully enough. The fencing is plastic and breaks easily.
4,"GOOD INFORMATION, TINY PRINT",I PURCHASED THIS BOOK AS A RESOURCE FOR MY PARENTS. THE INFORMATION IS GREAT BUT PERHAPS A BOOK ABOUT AGING HEALTHFULLY SHOULD BE SENSITIVE TO THE DIMINISHED VISION OF MOST AGING READERS. CHARGE A BUCK MORE AND PRINT IT IN A LARGER TYPE.
2,Type IT,"just not what I thought it would be. I expected the pen to pick up the words of each sentence as I scrolled it across the page.It seemes that the button that is compressed to turn on the light just doesn't want to work all the time.half way across the page the light turns on and then it reads a few words and then the light goes out and you end up with half a sentence.After much frustration by my adult daughter, she laid the pen down and started typing the information.I'll wait to make a final judgement after I get to try it, but I did try it for about 5 seconds when she was frustrated and it seems to not function like they say it should.Not totally impressed with this item."
1,Do not buy it!,"I strongly discourage you from buying this product. Driver did not install on my brand new Windows XP system. My husband, who is a professional Microsoft Systems Engineer with all the possible Microsoft certifications and 15 years of Windows experience, could not make the driver work. Customer support in US does not respond to any requests. Headquarters in Belguim does not answer the phone during working hours. I wish I saw all the negative reviews on Amazon before throwing money on wind!"
2,"Disapointing product, horrible support","The pen works well for a while but then, it crashes Windows XP :( I also tried it on a mac and it often doesn't recognize the device at all! Moreover, I tried to get some driver updates and I couldn't find them. So, I wrote their customer support people, they replied once to get some more info about my settings and then... nothing!If I could return this pen, I definitely would!"
1,Poor results,"First, upon installation you're warned that the product has not passed Windows Logo Review, so even though it says ""Supports Windows XP"" on the box, you're cautioned that the software may destabalize your system.Second, unless the text you're scanning is triple-spaced, it's pretty much useless. It scans one line at a time, so after calibrating the proper line and fixing OCR errors, you may as well have typed it yourself.Third, if you're buying one from CompUSA, DON'T. Three words: 15% restocking fee."
5,I appreciated the sense of family that I got from the book.,"I enjoyed learning some of the local history of Texas from an ordinary person's view, especially since this person was my great grandfather. I had never heard the stories from any family member before. The descriptions of events and locales really brought home a sense of family. It shows that small events shape a country as well as large events. It also reminded me how much history can be lost unless someone takes the time to write it down."
4,Best Sequel Comic Book Ever!,"I could not wait for the second Get Fuzzy book. The comic strip is absolutely hilarious, and it always makes me smile. You will love Bucky's (the cat) funny quips, the mischief he gets into and the excuses he makes to get out of trouble. My favorite strips are when Bucky makes up a definition for words he does not fully understand- it's just great. And then the dog is fun because of his lack of knowledge and the way he tries to be part of the intelligent conversations. This book sits out on my desk and it read constantly when I need a little humor to brighten my day. I recommend this book to everyone with a sense of humor."
1,GARFIELD II!,"If it walks like a duck, sounds like a duck, then it must be a duck! In this case all we see here is a cheap rip off of the original Garfield. Let's see both Garfield and Get Fuzzy both star obnoxious cat, a simpleton dog and a nerdy owner. Of all the possibilities in the world Darby could have chosen, he opts to use the same three types of characters that Garfield has. Could he have more plagaristic than that? If it isn't Garfield, why then do people have to keep defending it so much that it is not? Why are we all automatically reminded of Garfield if Get Fuzzy really is not? If it wasn't Garfield to begin with, then no one should have to insist that it isn't. I cannot believe the heaps of praise this stuff gets. THis is the most shallow, unoriginal strip out there. You know what an imposible task is? Trying to explain to another person what Get Fuzzy is, who has never heard of Get Fuzzy, without them thinking of Garfield."
1,Not Funny,"This is not a funny strip period. All it is is Garfeild. Do not compare this to the best strips of the past. It is a simple shallow cartoon. Darbey has yet to explore areas that might make this strip entertaining. What made ""The Great"" strips entertaining were that they used political, historical, religious, and philisophical outtakes to make them work. ""Get Fuzzy"" is not any of these.Simply owning a pet does not mean this is funny. Also Conley must be pretty thin skinned to have so many bad reviews deleted from Amazon.com. It is a bad strip, really bad strip."
5,Great Book!!!!,...I absolutely love Get Fuzzy and think it's the best comic out there right now. It's just hilarious to see some of the conflict brought on by Bucky the cat and Satchel the dog. Get this book and it will provide you with many many laughs.
5,Fuzzy Logic: Get Fuzzy 2,"I laughed so hard! I received this book yesterday, and I finished it yesterday, I couldn't put it down. I love the strip where they dress up for Halloween and Satchel's ""Scariest""costume idea is a cardboard version of a vacuum cleaner. I can't wait for the next book. I have the comic strip sent to my email everyday, I just can't get enough."
4,An American Classic preserved for posterity,"I had been ""hooked"" on The New Moon, ever since seeing the NY City Opera do it in the early '80s; while over the top, it still is musically thrilling, and while corny, you can not help but be ""hooked"" when the corps of men line up along the stage for ""Stouthearted Men"".I don't think there had been a full score recording available (lots of extracts) until now and the music crackles from the opening bar of the Overture.I withheld the 5th star, not from the recording, but that in including everything, there are a few dead spots in the operetta (often cut out), but I would rather have too much of a good thing than not enough.All singers are remarkable, the pacing is good, and the sonic qualities are to die for.Best of all, this virtually entire score, has been preserved now for generations to come. Bravo!!"
4,It does its job very well,"This product does what I expected it to do - allows me to communicate with people over Internet. Both the sound quality from the headphones and from the mic is very good(hard to expect more :)). Of course, I have tried to play some music through the headset and was somewhat surprised to the richness of its reproduction.The included USB sound card was recognized and accepted by my Windows XP based PC with no problem and the quality of sound produced by the USB card exceeds the one installed in my computer(not a high-end one though).I really like the flexibility the USB sound card brings and was sold on its presence in the package.The minor issue - not quite convenient shape of the headset (or better to say the pressure it makes) which starts to bother me after some extensive usage. But once I have found an acceptable fit\position on my head it sits just fine.All in all I like the headset."
1,Essentials of Fire Department Customer Service,This text was extremly overpriced. I recently saw the same book in our State Fire Academy bookstore and the IFSTA catalog for $21.00. I paid over $45.00 from Amazon.
4,You are your worst enemy,"I took lessons from professional coaches who focused on techniques. All the while, I kept beating myself down for not being able to master the different aspects of the game. Until this book came out! What a revelation. It shifted my focus into positive thinking, or non-thinking. I stopped figiting with myself and focused on the ball. I began to experience ""being in the zone"" in one particular double tournament. My opponents couldn't believe how they could let the game slipped away when they were ahead 5-3. I went back and read the book from time to time and had given a few of them away to my friends. Buy it and read it. It will improve your game better than any of those technical jargons."
1,not a good book,"this book was well written, however, it is just a bunch of psych mumbo jumbo that really will have no effect on my game.i cannot even apply anything that i read to really improve psychologically or physically to the game. it is truly a waste of money. i wished that i could say otherwise, however, it was not very good."
2,good concepts...,but i don't play tennis. i bought this book b/c i heard that a college basketball coach had recomended it to one of his struggling players. the book helped the player reach his potential. i wish i would have gotten the inner game of basketball instead. i don't know enough about tennis to really appreciate this book.
4,not only for tennis...,this book was recommended to me by an acting teacher a few years ago. when it is applied to acting it was one of the most helpful and relevant books i've read. any activity or sport could be substituted for tennis. excellent advice to help you get out of your own way. well worth the read!
5,Absolutely awesome and based on experience!,"This is a great book. It taught me a lot as a tournament player and as a person in general. Right now, my coach is also using some of the techniques suggested by the book. The Inner Game of Tennis is a book every tennis player who wants to perform better should read."
4,Medieval pudding with a northern twang,"Blancmange are: Neil Arthur, [vocalist] and StephenLuscombe, [instruments]. Both are English 1980's""synth-pop"" advocates. They decided to call themselvesafter a medieval French 'pudding' [dessert] called'Blanc mangier',a sweet gelatin - cornstarch mixturewith almonds.From 1979-1987 they rode the alternative wave andwere stablemates with Soft Cell, and Depeche Modeon the ""Some Bizarre"" pulpit of pop respectibility.This re-mastered compilation of drum machines andof course, analog syntheziers is excellent. Whowould even think of selecting an Abba song tocover in their own creative style??For me..I just can't enough..[sorry, Depeche Mode].Consequently I beleive I shall purchase Mange Tout.Therefore I can have petit pois' before my blancmangier. How romantic. Which of course might applyto our industrial friends from up north..Neil andStephen.For the real deal check out Talk Talk,Visage, Men Without Hats,and China Crisis."
2,you get what you pay for sometimes,"It worked but don't expect magic or anything. The size of the mike would have been fine for a 2nd grader. I found myself having to shout to be heard. It was ok, but i found a better one later for the same price"
1,Awful lost of money,There was a good discount by amazon and I decided to try this model. Previously had koss earphones but different ones.Lost of money. Problems with sound started on the third day. Mechanical problems on the fifth. Had to throw the to the litter after 10 days.
4,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,"For 8 bucks don't be expecting amazing sound quality. I paid $10 for my pair and was very satisfied. They fit my ears perfectly, and the sound was very good for that pricerange. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of five was that they broke after 6 months. At first the left channel started crackling, but now it is completely gone. Still, I'm about to buy another pair, because nothing I've tried since has really compared to these."
2,Read the first 100 pages and then read no more.,"If you want to read something really believable read "" El Narco "" by British authorIoan Grillo. It reads like a novel while it is a real investigative report."
5,awesome book,"Its a good book for the people who are working in the field of evolutionary biology, particulary in the field of orchid biology.Mani"
1,Don't waste your money,"What do you get when you cross an impossibly confusing (yet boring) plot with awful directing? ""Love, Honour, and Obey""The movie flows like it was filmed in about 2 days and thrown together in someone's basement editing room.(I'll admit, I only rented it because Jude Law was in it. In actuality, he's not even the main character.)Unless you'd particularly like to watch an hour and a half of unmotivated killing, bad dialouge, and old people having sex, take my advice: don't waste your money on this one."
3,Change of Pace Comedic Showcase,"""Hoochie Mama Drama"" starts off as exactly what the cover art promises: an off the chain, over the top hood comedy throwback with a Los Angeles Mexican spin. The characters are definitely not PC and stereotypes, yet the performers are skillful enough to make them believable and interesting. Production values are top notch, and the plot line veers away from the predictable once things get going and keep you guessing. Choices made by the writer at the end of the film are surprising and interesting. Rapper Deadlee 2213, in his first lead role, acquits himself well as a drug dealing Lothario juggling women and navigating drug deals, all the while not imbibing anything stronger than some shotglasses of liquor in one scene. All in all, a lightweight and fun romp that doesn't waste your time."
4,jacket to be used for travel,jacket is sturdy and well made. im sure it is great for its intended purpose. i however got it for travel. found some of the front upper pockets too small for anything but maybe a pill bottle. the other pockets hold a lot of stuff. the back pocket is large but if you put anything in it you cant comfortably sit in an airplane seat. the answer would be to pack it and then put it in the overhead.you can put enough stuff in it for it to be heavy.
5,Perfect for my ears,"I had searched for lightweight over-the ear but NOT in ear headphones. These were the pair I found that work best for my needs and my ears. They have a good range of sound, and I have no personal issues with how I experience sound quality. They rest over my ear and as far as I can tell are NOT meant to fit in the ear canal, which is what I wanted. No problems with glasses (which the large pad over-ear models have), and they have the Koss limited lifetime warranty. I've had mine for ~7 years, sent one pair to Koss for free replacement when I lost sound in one side. That cost me something like $3 shipping.They aren't best for sports, I use the Koss ""Clipper"" which can be put in the ear canal, or rest on top (my preference) for that."
5,Awesome set of balls,"Helps my deep tissue myofascial release; specifically with the pecs, shoulders, thoracic spine, glutes and feet. And my cat loves them. Very solid, quality balls :)"
1,"This version is not good, friends!","This board book has been abridged, I'm assuming, in order to cater to younger children. However, it has been abridged so poorly that the story has become incomprehensible even to an adult. I purchased this book as a present but ended up putting it right into the recycling bin. I didn't even want to give it away. No Beatrix Potter appreciator should be exposed to this; the unabridged version would make more sense to any child."
2,GOOD BUT HARDLY PERFECT,"IN TERMS OF THE AUDIO THESE HEAD PHONES SEEM FINE, ALTHO I PRIMARILY USE THEM FOR BOOKS SO THE QUALITY OF TONE MATTERS LESS THAN IF I WAS USING THEM FOR CLASSSICAL MUSIC. THEY ARE A TRIFLE BULKY EVEN WHEN FOLDED.BUT AFTER ONLY A FEW WEEKS OF USE, I FOUND A CRACK IN THE COVERING THAT EXPOSED A WIRE. I HAVE COVERED IT WITH ELECTRICAL TAPE AND THEY ARE WORKING FINE RIGHT NOW, BUT WHO KNOWS FOR HOW LONG. MY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THESE PHONES WERE MADE SOME TIME AGO AND THE RUBBER/PLASTIC WIRE COVERING CRACKED WITH AGE...BUT WHAT DO I KNOW???"
1,black and decker mega mouse,"I used one on only one piece of furniture, the allen wrench fruitless whirled around rendering the ""interchange"" parts all useless. The sawdust collector appears not to be connected to the unit at all. Dust all over the place except in the holder. I tried 2 of them and will return the second soon - Worthless- correct your flaws Black and Decker!"
2,"Decent Sander, sandpaper hard to find","This sander is good for consumer use only -- and works well. My problem is that neither of the big box stores carry a good selection of sandpaper for this model and at best they sell one or two grades in 5-piece packages. If I could find the sandpaper in all grades (60, 80, 120, 180, 220, 320) in bulk I would be a happy camper. Since that's not the case, it's not a useful tool and paying over $1 per sandpaper change gets expensive."
2,"Eh, so so","I read a variety of teen books, then give reviews on them to the local bookstore which I work at. This book may stand out from the rest because it actually quotes what others teens themselves have to say on various topics. However, it lacks content and appears to be like many other teen books, addressing similar issues in similar ways. It won't bore you but it definitely won't leave you breathless. If you want a book with the same edge but filled with content try ""Stories for a Teen's Heart"" by Alice Gray or even Wade F. Horn's ""New Teen Book."" I can't think of many other books of this nature but the lack of content spoils a lot of the originality of this book."
3,"Good hardening info, lacking the security angle.","Building Secure servers does a stellar job explaning how to set up your computer in a locked down state. Where it fails is that you never get a good enoughunderstanding why these particular steps are necessary. In order for this book to be more complete, it needs to show you how a machine without these security measures can be broken into.I'd suggest picking up a copy of Hacking Linux Exposed and/or Real World Linux Security, both of which would serve as a much needed addition or replacement."
3,Non Fiction,"Bought to help while away a long plane flight, this book was somewhat useful as a introduction to linux security, and where to start when looking at exposing servers to the evil outside world. Included is more importantly what not to start, and what not to do, at the beginning. Not a bad book."
5,An intersting testimony.,Another try with the rewiev since it obviously hasn't been registered the first time wich was may the first. Very good dvd quality and very rewarding watching.
4,"Interesting, but hard to walk in!!","I loved the looks of these, and when I got them, I walked around my house in them, and found it just a little different. The slope is a little down from the heel, and I know that is how they are supposed to be, but I couldn't get used to it!! I even tried to wear them a few more times around the house, but then they rubbed my foot on the outside edge (I have a little wider foot). Anyway, my friend loves hers, but I tried and couldn't wear them! Too bad! :o("
2,Would be good as an episode of American Justice on TV .. but not a movie,"As an episode of American Justice with Bill Curtis on TV, this would have proven very good.After all, one of the worst things any of us can imagine is being wrongly imprisoned for something we really did not do.Documentaries that make us aware of this problem and how to improve accuracy of convictions with new technology is a good service.So why was this bad as a movie ?Perhaps it is our knowledge of the activism that people like Susan Sarandon and Danny Glover are often involved in that makes this feel less like a serious portrayal of these stories and more like the audience is being preached at.As an episode of Bill Curtis - American Justice, it would have been good.As a movie staged to look and feel like the stage play it was based on, this simply did not work as a movie."
5,"altered, but still good","The plot is by necessity altered and simplified from the series to fit into two hours. Really, this isnt worth watching unless you are already a fan of the show. It is still quite good, however, if you are interested in seeing a different sequence of events. Also, I thought the new version of the ending made a bit more sense."
1,almost the worst.,"The reason the jacket blurb has nothing to do with the book is because the publisher needed someone to buy this stinker. Subterfuge is the only way.Short course:challenging = bizarre and unreadable........deserving winner = it was a bad year for SF..........What it is, is a twisted trip making a postmodern slap against the space program as the phallic symbol of the homoerotic US Military. News flash to 70s types: we don't waste our time studying Freud anymore and this stuff doesn't interest us.Just a bad novel whose crap editing still gets called ""edgy"". Pass."
1,Not so good,"I used this paint to paint my rear calipers on my car. The paint took forever to dry (months, YES... believe it). It took so long that I had to paint one side with the caliper on the car to avoid down time and because I had one side already painted. Also when I had to bleed my calipers.. about a year later, the paint came off in a nasty goo like fashion. The paint would have been the perfect color BUT the actual paint sucked bad. Wouldn't recommended it to anyone. There are better caliper paints out there."
2,Bad Rework,"Got this to replace the album I had. They editted the first song so they could fit the bonus song on, which is not even close to ""Chicago"" quality song. Perhaps the boys had a reason for not including it the first time."
4,A glimpse of grief,"This book is essentially about a man dealing with grief over his wife's death, and in many ways, over his wife's life. I've heard people complain about the writing style, but I found it enhanced the feel of the book and the point the author was making. It's very conversational, which makes it more powerful. I think Carolyn Parkhurst does a nice job of dealing with a heavy subject without making the book overly heavy - it is effective, but since the main plot revolves around a dog, it brings it to a manageable weight on your mind.I recommend it."
2,Needs more,"I just finished reading this book over the weekend. Granted, the overall plot was interesting enough to keep me reading until the very end. Perhaps, I thought the book would get MORE interesting as I read on. Much to my dismay, it didn't. For one thing, as many other reviewers have pointed out, there was little character development. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters...except maybe the poor dog, Lorelei. I found Lexy to be quite an annoying person and did not see HOW Paul would have wanted to be with someone like her to begin with. I thought the book was predictable and poorly executed. The author wrote in the voice of a man but with a heart of a woman. The relationship she imagined between the two characters seemed so unreal I couldn't connect with them. I guess I was hoping it would turn out to be another ""Lovely Bones."" If you have to pick between this book or ""Lovely Bones"" and have not read either one, read ""Lovely Bones."""
1,This Book IS a Dog,"This is truly one of the most dreadful, depressing books I have ever read. I did not like any of the characters and thought they were two dimensional at best. And maybe it's because I am a dog lover that I just could not stomach what happened to Lorelei. This book left me depressed for a couple of days after I finished reading it - because it's horrible and because I actually bought it in hard cover.I am an electic, avid reader and fairly sophisticated about my reading choices. However, I'd like to burn my copy of this book. I give it minus stars."
1,What a disappointment!,"I can not recommend this book to anyone and perhaps for the same reason that one reviewer mentioned. The characters of the man and woman were not developed enough for me to sense that they had a real relationship or to care what happened to them. Lexy's character never seemed real to me, and reasons for her depression or suicide tendencies were vague. As for the section dealing with mutilation of dogs for scientific purposes, I didn't even read those pages. Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews for this book. I'm very open minded and read all sorts of books, but this one did not engage me in any way."
2,"I don't ""get it!""","Two stars instead of one, simply because the grammer and punctuation is decent. Perhaps I'm unable to suspend disbelief long enough to wrap my brain around this story--because I'm befuddled by all the glowing reviews this book has received. The characters seemed under-developed (what's the deal with Lexy's rage?). If she was so unstable, how could Paul be completely oblivious? The secret society and dog mutillation was ridiculously unnecessary--why it was thrown into the story at all is inexplicable to me. Very bizarre, indeed!"
4,Great read,"This book is really good. I had to read it for school, but ended up taking it in two days. The imagery is what really makes the book so great. Highly recommended!"
2,A real downer,"A friend told me this book had been on the USA Today bestseller list for a long time. Okay, so I read the blurb. A man teaching a dog to talk. I remember how much I loved Dean Koontz's Watchers and forked over way too much money. Certainly the author is skilled, but this book is not uplifting like The Lovely Bones. I can handle death, but when dogs are mutilated, I can't take it. What really haunts me is that the author probably saw an article about actual people who do these horrible things and went on to weave a fictional story about it. I know these things exist in the real world, but I don't have to read about them for entertainment. And that's why I read. Anyone else who wants a good book about dogs, if you haven't read Watchers, pick it up. It's been re-released recently. Sorry, Parkhurst, but you're off my list."
3,A literary device that does not work,"A professor is devastated by the death of his wife, Lexy, unsure whether it is accident or suicide. During this account of the professor's grieving process, a portrait of his wife and their marriage emerges. Unfortunately, a central element of the plot is the professor's attempt to teach his dog to talk, the dog being a witness to his wife's death. This just does not work as a literary device, both because it is so implausible, and because it just is not interesting. ""The Dogs of Babel"" does have some wonderful and original writing: the account of the couple's first date, which lasted a week, and the stories of Lexus' creations as a mask maker. Lexus is a beautiful but sad character: think of Audrey Hepburn in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", if she were to be totally in love, but battling depression. I would recommend the ""Truth About Celia"" by Kevin Brockmeier as a wonderful, original, quirky novel about the grieving process, a novel much superior to this one."
2,Bizarre tale,I read the book and didn't like most of it. It was interesting about the dog but other than that I don't see what the hype is all about. Save your money and buy other titles.
3,"Weird, Sad, Disturbing... Just Plain Strange","I think ""just plain strange"" is the best way to describe this book. Clearly as we read along, the wife, who has died after a fall from an apple tree, is a bit disturbed. The thought that the husband wants to know what their dog witnessed when and before it happened is interesting. How the story goes about answering those questions and the husbands discovering the secret animal experimenting group is just creepy. I found it disturbing to read what had been done to the dogs. It seemed out of place for the story.I finished this book in a day. I think it could have been better without the dog cruelty covered.It was a sad story."
1,Don't waste your time...,"The storyline is the only thing that is worth anything in the book. It is a very tedeous read, almost painful. There is no clear end to the book. If you want the adventures of the a teenage D&D game with the play by play this is your book. But if not... Well, just skip it and do yourself a favor."
2,Missing a little Je ne sais quoi,"The plot got better over time, but in many places I found it to be lacking. It seems like the work of someone who hasn't quite figured out the intricacies of what detail needs to be included and what detail can be left out. He just didn't push far enough. There are some details that really didn't make a whole lot of sense either, such as how a main character with the particular set of experiences and attributes that James had could know and accomplish some of the things he did, even if he did read a lot of fantasy books.I'd say this makes for a mediocre book for middle school students. With some more practice perhaps Pratt could go somewhere, but this didn't really hit the mark.*Re-posted from goodreads.com"
4,great start for the set,"This is a great read and I was very happy about the thought that went in to the story. I was a little confused at the very beginning, that might have been me it was good enough the order the rest and then pass them onto my husbands kindle."
5,Book One of the Morcyth Saga,"I have liked this style of book for over 25 years. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down. I was hooked from the first chapter! It moves along at a good pace. I thouroughly enjoyed it.If you liked the ""Chronicles of Thomas Covenant"" series, then you will love this series also. I highly recommend this book. Please hurry with Book Two!"
5,Addicting,This was one of the best books i have read! I am going to buy the whole series that is how good it is. IF YOU TRUST ME FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS : 1)GET THIS BOOK; 2)READ IT ; 3) ENJOY IT!
1,Not my favourite.,"I am sorry but I could not get into this book at all. I seldom am unable to finish reading a book, but after only a couple of chapters I gave this one away."
2,Wrong age group,I'm a 72 year old eclectric reader and enjoy fantasy. This book was written for 12 year olds. Give me Elizabeth Moon.
2,"Good Premise, poor editing/grammar","I had a horrible time making my way through this book due to the horrible grammar and poor or non-existent editing. There was bad use and awkward switching of tense, along with spelling and grammatical errors throughout. The story premise could be good, but the execution just didn't make it. It's a prime example of how important it is to have good proofreading/editing. I'm glad this was a free Kindle download. Even though I am a bit curious how things work out, I won't be paying for or reading the rest of the series."
2,Couldn't even finish it...,"I could not finish this book. Believe me I tried. Usually I can force myself through a book. Sometimes I continue reading when everything in me says MOVE ON and I'm rewarded but honestly I couldn't talk myself into finishing it. Maybe there's plot eventually. I have no idea. I read about 60% of this book. All that I read of it was the main character traveling and then fighting battles he shouldn't be able to survive and yet somehow does, then he travels some more, gets into some more craziness he shouldn't get out of alive and then more traveling. None of it seems to have a purpose. It's just walk walk walk and then fight fight fight. It felt like a dungeon crawler video game. No real purpose. Just walking and killing. I have no clue why this has so many good reviews. I'd think maybe it gets better in the end except so many people feel the exact same way I did that I have to say I must be right and it's not worth it."
4,A fun read,"I enjoyed the two books, although I don't care for the cliffhanger at the end of the second book.I think the two star reviews were a little harsh -- this is a decent work and worth reading.It does seem like a D n D lover's book, but isn't like some fanfic. It has an interesting spin on the adventurer in another world that I liked.I didn't like some of the obvious mistakes the main character made, but he improves as the story progresses. I really enjoyed some of the ideas on how an untrained novice might learn how to use magic, and combine that with experience from our world.Update. I finished reading this book in 2010, but it still lingers in my thoughts. This series has some interesting twists that still have me wanting more."
4,I liked it.,"I bought this book for my android with the kindle app because it was free. Yes, I agree with some of the negative reviews for this book, they make valid points. I however will rate this book higher and give it a 4 star rating because of its simple charm, the story does get a little cheesy at times, but however cheesy it gets Pratt gives enough of everything else that I like, to keep me reading. I have just finished purchasing the entire saga.I would NOT recommend buying these in hardcover or even paperback, but the cheap kindle version's were worth the price to me, that or goto your library and borrow them. They are worth reading because they are very entertaining, but maybe not worth the higher prices of hardcover/paperback.I would compare this as a cheap terry goodkind knock off, with a twist.at least don't pass the first book up, its free in kindle format and will help you decide for yourself."
2,Shallow,This book had no depth or character development the plot is pretty simplistic and never develops much. The narrative perspective is odd and distracting.If this was a first draft written by 14yr I would probably say it was great but anyone who is as old and claims to have read as much as the author should have known better to release a book in this rough of state.I will not be reading any of the sequels.
1,"Same content, no past or future tenses","This book has an interesting premise, however it fails to deliver a story that carries the reader away into another land. The primary problem is that is does not use past or future tense. Also, several times words have been confused such as effect and affect. Like several other reviews have said, it sounds like a transcription of a D&D game that has been thrown together into a ""book"" without any proofreading or editing to make it interesting. The author clearly has a nice idea, but a horrible implementation."
1,"Average story, awkward writing","The glowing 5 star reviews are likely fake. I'm not sure I'll even finish it. The plot is pretty standard (""boy tricked into entering a magical world""), but the writing is not very good. An actual quote: ""His eyes start to water and can barely breathe."" Another: ""They stroll down the street eating their tarts, when James sees coming down the street toward them, a group of boys a little older than Miko."" I realize the author self-published, but I think he should at least find a literary friend to proofread his work. I'm just glad I got a free e-book and not a hardcover!"
2,no depth,"As everyone says, since this was a freebie so I decided to give it a try. The storyline sounded interesting. Unfortunately, the characters were very 2 dimensional. The main charactor, James, seemed to just meander along from place to place with no goal or idea except to do ""what feels right"". Other than that all he and Miko does is fight off bad guys and eat one meal after another.With lots of irrelevant observations.The other annoying thing was, although for young adults, the writing was so simplistic that if not for all the fighting would be more for an elemantary student. Talk about dummying down for the reader! Definately no challenge.Needless to say I will not be reading anymore from this series and probably won't give the writer another try."
4,"Brill, but could be better","The ""behind the story line"" plots are a little weak at times and there are a few surprises. Its a great season but you can certainly tell that there was a writers strike going on at the time."
5,Bones in top five of TV shows 4 years running,I do not miss an episode of Bones. The exrtas on the CD set are great
4,Bones season 3,Item was overall in good condition. There were some parts of the dvd that would say skiping over damaged area.
1,one of the CDs is defective and cannot be viewed.,Season three has several CDs to the set. One of the CDs is defective and cannot be viewed. Very disappointing. Will think twice before I order any more of these items.
5,Avaya 2420 Phone,"The Avaya 2420 phone works perfectly with our old school Lucent Definity phone system and Intuity Audix voicemail system. The call log feature is very helpful, and Avaya and Plantronics wireless headsets plug directly in to the phone without the need for a handset lifter. New or Refurbished, these 2420 phones have been rock solid, and they are great replacements for our Avaya 6400 series phones. As an IT Professional, I highly recommend the Avaya 2420."
1,Not So Good Lines,"As a jazz guitarist you always listen for what you can learn from someone, what they do well and not well. Russell is an amazing talent when it comes to chord melody playing. His voicings, along with slick tricks using harmonics makes for a beautiful addition to the standard approach to playing jazz guitar chord melody. What makes this CD difficult to listen to is his playing in time or with the rhythm section. His lines are mostly un inventive and have a very awkward feel. It does not have the feel of say, Grant Green or George Benson. It sounds as if his picking is not worked out well and subtracts from the over all rhythmic feel of the music. I would love to hear a record of just solo guitar from this artist!"
2,Many errors in this book,"I would not recomment this book to beginners because of the frequency of mistakes. I'm an experienced knitter, and had a hard time with some of the patterns. For instance, the cast on and number of stitches weren't even mentioned in one of her hat patterns. I eventually figured it out by counting the stitches that were in the rounds.Suss Counsins...Knitter to the Stars! Please. This book looks all shiny, pretty, and hip. Upon closer inspection, the patterns are a bunk. I've tried to make several items in this book, and just about every pattern has a correction to it. To find the corrections for the pattern one must visit Suss Cousins's website. I find this frustrating, because I was expecting a level of quality that wasn't there. I will, however, grudgingly admit that the book does make knitting seem glamourous with photography. In the end, save your money, and check this book out of your local library."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?,"What happened? Where is the melodic Cure we know and love? The lush song structures? This album has none of that. It gets 1 star for ""Aniversary"" - in my opinion - the best track on the album. On just about every other track on the album - Robert Smith's voice is all over the place - and not in a good way! I am all for experimentation (..The Top - I personally loved it!) but this seems to have NO direction - and Roberts voice gets increasingly irritating when he is shouting and howling through ALL the songs. Sorry...I have been a fan since 1981 -and this new Cure donsn't seem like the Cure at all."
5,"The Cure, refocused","A lot of reviewers are griping over the raw, immediate sound on this album, writing open letters to Robert as though he is personally betraying them.The Cure have always been about following their own muse, not conceding to fan expectations. This is the most vital, impressive Cure album in years. Any hint of stagnancy or uncertainty is gone. The Cure have finally captured the intensity and power of their live shows on a studio CD.Dissonant, angry, raw, yet still imbued with fantasy and hope that things won't fall apart even as they are -- welcome to Cure 2004."
2,This is Cure's Disintegration,"I'm listening to the album right now, not for the first time but yes if a little closer. It is terrible. Sounds angry, uninspired and really like nothing left to say... 'Anniversary' is amazingly different from the rest of the songs, but it is plain to see that this is a commercially aimed release... and even fails in hooking with nice melodies. The 'art', the 'lushness' of previous records give way to a very common rock band everyday's life sound, nothing to do with the originality and distinctiveness The Cure had in the past.I'm starting to think as well that maybe Robert Smith is starting to use the band to release his own personal demons in the way Roger Waters did with Pink Floyd before they split up.A pity."
3,"Average, eclectic mix of Cure styles","Veteran rock act The Cure has experimented with various styles over the years, but has maintained uniqueness with the voice and quirky, moody songs of Robert Smith. This album is inconsistent in musical style, with some slow, acoustic-flavored songs and some edgy, guitar-driven tracks. None of the songs here seem particularly memorable in comparison to many tracks from the late 80s/early 90s Cure albums. However, most of the songs are original and listenable, and should satisfy existing Cure fans. In a popular musical scene dominated by fluffy pop, formulaic rap, raunchy R&B, polished punk, and fusions of the above styles, it is nice to hear a veteran rock act with originality."
1,The Cure is Sick,"After hearing the demos of the first five songs I just can say this is the worst Cure album I've listen to!Here, the music is just an unobstrusive background for Smith's choppy phrases. The music is not melodic nor fit for restaurant background, unless the shop tenders want this to work as an eat-fast-and-go-away trigger.I mean, if none of the first five songs ring a bell, you better don't risk your money in this just hoping the rest of the tracks are better. If you don't have them, buy any of their best albums, like ""Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me"", Wish, or The Head on the Door.Moreover, look at the cover art, it really represents the ""hard work"" they put in this album ;-)You really have to be a fundamentalist fan to like this album."
1,Waste of money!,"First off,i truly really truly can't believe someone said this is the best album yet.Did this person even hear anything else by them??This album has absoulutly no depth what so ever.It sounds like a totally new band,not a veteran band that has been around since the late seventies.I can't stand how Robert just sings the same crap over and over,like he could'nt think of anything else to say!What a waste of money and time spent listening to this drivel."
5,Addictive,I think this stands alongside their best (and I have them all). I like the sound and the blend of despair and confused romanticism. I hear it as an evolution rather than a wandering from the one true path.
3,Eh...,"I was disappointed with the cd as well. I just don't feel that same vibe I get with other Cure albums. A few of the songs just repeat on and on and on. There really aren't any stand out tracks. Don't get me wrong, the cd is alright, just definitely not my favorite. Maybe it's just me, but eh, worth buying, but don't expect to be wowed."
4,Dirt - my thoughts,Quite simply: I love this game. My kids (10 and 13) can play it. The learning curve is brilliant if you start at the lowest skill level and progress as you start to find things easier.GET THIS IF YOU LIKE DRIVING GAMESMy only niggles are: no rain and no two player on one console option. That said the online gaming works fine - just wanted to race my kids and finally show them who is boss!
4,The best rally game ever,"This is the best rally game I ever played. The career mode is very similar than previous version (Colin Mc Rae sagas) although time, the driving experience feels more real than ever. The graphics and sound are excellent and your oponents (new in this game) make the racing experience more aggressive. I highly recommend this racing game for those gamers that like rally driving experience."
4,Fun with Dirt,"This is the most fun I have had with Dirt since I was a little kid.The game is fairly easy to get started, yet challenges me.I wish I had a wheel setup."
3,DIRT RACING GAME,"PRETTY GOOD GAME , BUT NOT AS GOOD AS DIRT 2 ; THEY SEEM TO GET BETTER..LOTTA STUFF TO DEAL WITH OFF ROAD RACING...CHALLENGING TOOO..IS DECENT GAME"
4,A helpful gadget,"Bought it because of my husband's back surgery - no twisting, etc. It is helpful but the handle gadget that you put in the steel loop on the door frame works MUST BETTER for an aid to get in and out of the car. Now that product is worth the purchase!"
2,"Flat Sound, No Bass","I wanted pretty design and a coiled cord, so I took a risk with Koss. Maybe I got a defective pair, but the sound was poor, flat with almost no bass. Some reviewers say you need an extra amp for these, but my 100 watt-per-channel amplifier says ""I don't think so"", and overall volume was very high, just the bass was missing. My old $25 Sennheiser sounds much better. Returned next day, won't try Koss again."
1,Maybe mine were faulty?,"I had my pair of Koss headphones for several months and tried listening to them several times but they sounded so terrible I couldn't stand it; the sound being ""dark"" and ""dead"". I have an old pair of Koss headphones I bought from Radio Shack and a pair of Grado SR80s and they both sound pretty good to my ears so I don't believe my ears are totally at fault. I gave them to the Goodwill."
1,Awful noise,"I got these to use for my office and they turned out to be worse than useless. In order for them to work, you have to plug in the sending unit which needs to be fairly close to your radio. Unfortunately, with my preferred station, the noise generated by the power supply completely overwhelms the signal so these headphones are totally useless. Even when playing a CD the sound quality is terrible. I'm better off just turning it way down and living with it. I would suggest looking elsewhere for cordless headphones."
1,Digital edition costs more than print!?!,"For some reason the publisher wants me to pay MORE for the digital edition than the print, even though they've turned off features and I can't resell it or give it away.I get it, Simon & Schuster/Free Press, you don't want me to buy a digital copy even though that's how I read now. Fine, I'll buy a used copy and you'll never see a profit from my sale in the first place. I just can't figure out, from an economics perspective, why you'd want that. *shrug*"
2,"Muddled and unconvincing, with some good concepts","There were some good concepts here, but the stories meant to use the ideas all went astray. Each application of an economic principle to the story changed the result, and when he stopped with one conclusion, I always wondered why he didn't take it one more step and reach the opposite conclusion. It seems that any conclusion wanted can be reached. His arrogant commentary left me distrusting his chosen conclusion. Maybe economic theory isn't so useful after all.Much better was 'New Ideas from Dead Economists.'"
5,Quality tools at a discounted price,"I recently purchased this set of tools from Amazon/Grizzly Tools. I wished they qualified for Free Shipping. They arrived about 3 days after ordering via UPS. They arrived in perfect condition, packed completely in shipping peanuts. This set offers 6 tools that you need for turning. I compared prices from stores and online stores. This kit is about $110 cheaper than my local woodworking store. (I purchased the set for $179.) I have turned several things using these tools and have been very pleased. The HSS (High Speed Steel) used is of excellent quality. Two of the handles are longer than the others. All tools are solid and well balanced. I had an email confirmation from Grizzly once they had received the order. I think you will be very pleased if you purchase this set."
3,No Opinion,this was a required read for me while I was at U C Riverside. It helped with some writing assignments but I overall did not use it all that much because I was fine without it.
2,Images a little fuzzy...,"I ordered this becaue I needed a good basic review of standard X-rays. It addresses most orthopedic issues, however the image examples are a little fuzzy and you can't see detail. Overall a pretty good book."
1,a long to arrive,"I'm form Brazil. I purchase a DKNY perfum, 04/18/2008 and today is 06/01/2008 and still don't arrive."
5,Meditation,I took a class in which we did a meditation from this book and I wanted my own copy...exctly what I was looking for...I LOVE IT :)
2,Overhyped and soon to be forgotten,"A yuppie novel filled with glib, ironic sarcasm. This guy must have a very expensive publicist."
3,Boo,"Moody's novel, Purple America bored me. There is a sure reason for the low price.Yes, his character's are dysfunctional. Yes, they bleed strange characteristics,but i wasn't entertained. I give it three stars because Moody's reoccuring mood resembled a tainted Palahniuk novel. I wouldn't reccommend this novel and don't plan on reading anything else written by Moody, as harsh as it sounds."
2,Disgusting,This tasted so disgusting I could only use it twice. I tried using half a scoop but it the taste was so strong that it still made me gag. It might me great but for me it's unusable.
1,Slayer has lost it !,"I dont know what happen but slayer is not slayer any more. I think slayer is trying to impress kids that like limp bizkit and korn and fogeting how to do guitar solo's ... I'll admit, that ""Bitter piece "" is a good tune but all of the other songs are really boring. I bet going to school and listining to an 50 year old would be more fun then listining to slayer's ""diabolus musica"". I will put slayer in the same category of all of those ...bands like cannibal corpse,deicide for wanting to focus to much on their image by being scary,dark,gross and having evil images on all of their album covers and realy fogetting to focus on how to play and being about the music and not being about impressing lil stupid kids. Thats all i have to say !"
1,Slayer gone Commercial,"This album is [terrible].I couldnt figure out why Slayer tried to change their sound from Thrash to ""Pop"" Metal.Nothing beats Slayer's first five albums(except for old Judas Priest).Tom Arraya sounds ""goofy"" tryin to sing these songs.Its even worse when I heard ""Stain of Mind"" live when I saw Slayer in Boston last November.The only songs that grabbed me were ""Bitter Piece"" and ""Point"".If u r gonna pick up any Slayer albums,buy any except for this one.This is a posers dream come true."
4,Good effort,"+AH4-Yes, ""DiM"" is very agressive. Yes, there are moments here that would make ""Postmortem"" seem like a kid's x-mas song. But what there are two major elements lacking in this release - GOOD SONGS and EVIL LYRICS! It seems that slayers spent too much time thinking up the cool riffs and solos, so they forgot to make a single song that listeners can remember after 5 minutes. The lyrics, too, are very intelligent and very thought provoking... But do not expect to find there any good+AH4-+AH4- old unholiness or insanity (like ""Gemini""). No, nothing of that - Slayer is now a ""mature and intelligent"" band! Sad. Worth a listen anyway, though, just for the pureness of its agression+AH4-"
4,"slow, then fast!","i'm giving this cd a 4 star rating because i love the way the songs were written. you can actually hear where kerry king stopped writing in the middle of the song, and hanneman took over! and that's great to see that they arranged it so well. However!!! I feel that most of this cd is too slow, but the vocals and lyrics are just awesome! hard? yes! but it's pretty repetitive, and if you're looking for something hard, go with divine intervention, it might just be me! also... what's with this new drummer??? sounds like he put some mouse pads over the toms and hit them as hard as he could. but the things he did with the bass drum are pretty good. highlights are in the name of god!! that song is freakin awesome! scrum, point, and bitter peace. may take some getting used to, but it does'nt happen for me that much."
4,Slayer is still Diabolic.,"I really like Diabolus in musica, but there are only 3 or 4 songs on it that would make my personal 'best of' slayer collection. The rest of the album is still Slayer, however, and much better than most of the other crap out there."
5,why the complaints?,"I'm hearing a lot of people talk about hip hop influences in slayer's latest album...have you people ever listened to hip hop? I think even the absolute MOST hip hoppy song on here has very close to NO relation to any real hip hop. slayer is old school thrash metal. they always were and they always will be. many people hear a slightly new sound come out of new slayer songs and immediately slap on ""trendy"" and ""rappy"" stickers all over their album. if you listen to the music for the music, man, and not for an attempt to insult them of converting to a different style of music, then you will get much more from the cd than you will if you listen to it with an accusing ear."
3,Still can't beat Seasons in the Abyss,"Everyday, I live and breathe Slayer. Their music is enough to raise the hair on the back of my neck, and to get through the worst of days. They're fast, loud, evil, powerful, and their onstage precense truly makes one take notice. However, Diabolus in Musica was...different. Tracks like Bitter Peace, Desire, and Point blew me away, but the rest sounds like a mix between Biohazard, Korn, and Sepultura. Love to Hate? Why the hell did they record that? Perversions of Pain? Boring. ""Seasons in the Abyss,"" along with Metallica's ""Master of Puppets"" remain to me as thrash's greatest masterpieces. But nevertheless, I always have faith in Slayer. Their next album can only be better."
3,Some good songs...,"Diabolus got some cool Slayer songs like Death's Head, Stain of Mind and Bitter Peace...but this must be the SLAYER album i care less...Compared to the heavy metal scene of today, this is a masterpiece, but it's not one of Slayer most inspired moments...Try the classics, the great covers album and the last 2 Christ Ilusion and World Painted Blood before this almost nu metal Slayer album...."
2,Unrealistic.,"Who wrote this book, Gordon Gekko on steroids? Not only are his suggestions unrealistic, they're sycophantic. I felt like I was getting bullied by frat boys listening to this. Anyone who says these in an interview or implies them in a cover letter would come across as an insincere backslapper. I can't imagine these promises applied in any practical way to a real job, let alone make a positive impression on an interviewer. If you have to promise to sleep over and risk your own health to your boss at the interview, is that really the job you want? Or would be offered?"
5,THREE STARS?!? WHAT!?,Why did these people give this bad ratings? It ends because the guy summoning the thing dies. These people don't seem to understand that. My favorite book.
2,The usual Derlethian mess,"August Derleth's ""posthumous collaboration"" with his idol H.P. Lovecraft (despite the credit, Lovecraft's contributions are merely snippets of his writing journal) is just all over the map, trying to tie three unrelated plot strands together through the usual Derlethian haunted house mumbo-jumbo. Some chilling sequences, but Derleth has jimmed so much mythos information into the story that it reads less as a horror novel and more like some junior high school kid's diary of all the ""neat stuff"" in Lovecraft. Derleth did this much better in his short stories, especially ""The Dweller in Darkness."""
4,Great For Readers Theatre!,"If you work with children in literature or drama, this is a GREAT book on which to build a readers theatre performance. There are a good half dozen characters with fairly equal emphasis and short lines. The parts can be played by either boys or girls, and the campy humor can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. I've used it for performance for several years and it's always a big hit."
4,Product Key doesn't work.,"I had the same problem with Works Suite 2002 that I had with 2006. The product key that came with the discs would not install Microsoft Word; the message ""invalid product key"" came up. After a computer problem, I reformatted the drive and did a reinstall from the original Works 2002 discs. The invalid key message showed up when I tried to install Word 2002. After arguing with Microsoft people for three weeks I bought the new Works Suite 2006. After running all the discs to a clean hard drive, everything worked except,again,the invalid key message came up and wouldn't activate Word. Highly irritating. I got it going by to Microsoft Works, Programs, clicked Word Document, got an ""activate product"" and got Word installed and running. This seems to be a dumb glitch in the software."
3,Microsoft Works Suite 2006 [Old Version],"Microsoft Works Suite 2006 [Old Version]is usually dependable, however, it can stall with the pop up as described below:---------------------------Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library---------------------------Runtime Error!Program: ...rogram Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office10\WINWORD.EXEabnormal program termination---------------------------OK---------------------------When this happens, Microsoft Word must be re-eninstalled, which of course should not happen for a Microsoft product."
4,review for The Potential Inside,The music on this Movie was the best part. At times the story was a little non-believable character wise- but it kept our attention.
5,READ THIS BOOK NOW!,"Starman: Sins Of The Father is the perfect book for people who think comics are infantile and insipid, because it proves they are idiots. The protagonist, Jack Knight, is a refreshing change of pace from typical comic hero. As the son of the legendary hero Starman, Jack has no desire to take his fathers place as defender of Opal City, and is content to run his ""antique"" shop(He sells 1950's Hawaiin shirts, old comics, vintage transistor radios, etc.) But Fate intervenes and Jack must become the new Starman to save his city, his Father, and himself. Mature without being vulgar, sentimental without being sappy, and all around well written, Starman: Sins Of The Father is a must have."
4,Milk Glass Moon,The book was engrossing and since I am an avid reader it kept my attention. The characters were real and interesting.
5,You will never want the story to end,"Just like the book review on the cover, it reads like ""sweet cream"". The author spins a wonderful tale of family, friends, places, love and life. An easy and up lifting read. I didn't want the book to end."
4,Great Service. Great Product,This was a great purchasing experience. Game arrived working appropriately as advertised and we got it very quickly. Was expecting it in 4 to 14 days and it came in 2 days. Thanks.
2,Poor quality guitar,"Tilt Sensor was broken within 3 or 4 hours of use. I use it for Rock band, I have yet to play Guitar hero.Gave it a two for quality but obviously i can't say how the game is so i gave it a three."
3,Hammering On And Pulling Off,"Normally my reviews are in depth, cover what people are wondering and what they haven't wondered yet, but I won't bother this time. Most has been said, with one glaring exception.The most satisfying part of GH2 was hammering on and pulling off. In GH3, a lot of notes normally played like that are now strummed individually, its a pain and less satisfying. I think they did it for realism, because they checked to see if the notes would ACTUALLY be played like that on a REAL guitar, but screw realism, this is a game, if I want realism I buy a real guitar. Its simple. This is also taking into account that in some tapped phrases they have random strums where they don't seem to make sense to be put there. It really takes away from it. I wish they didn't try to add that little slice of realism in there."
5,More of a Great Thing!,"If you liked Guitar Hero 2 then you will definitely like Guitar Hero 3. Lots of new songs with a few different twists on the graphics, but a lot of the same type of things in GH2, just with different songs. The wireless guitar is cool and only takes a button press on both the guitar and the console to connect. It was worth the money to me even though there is not a ton of changes from the previous version. Not quite what I would call a fully revamped edition from GH2, but enough differences to add it to your game collection."
5,Great game!,My kids love it!! They've been playing it just about everyday of the summer. Great songs!!
4,Rock like a hero!,"Well if you're not sucked into the rockband addiction yet, Guitar hero 3 is still an awesome game. The wireless guitar is very responsive and the detachable neck is convenient for taking it from one home to the next. Also the guitar IS compatible with rockband so if you have that game and only one guitar, you can get this bad-boy and rock with a full band at home. Not to mention that the downloadable songs are pretty good and with 2 free packs and 2 free songs that equals 8 free download songs off the back with the Halo theme being one of them. The game itself, to me, is a little less than guitar hero 2 but that is a complete matter of opinion in which I am the minority. All in all the game is as addictive as ever and the downloadable content helps keep it fresh."
2,This is a great Bundle but...,This would be a great bundle to get on the Wii is awesome and will provide hours of entrainment but Amazon price gouging is ridicules You can find the same bundle cheap if you go to ebay. That is where I brought mine.
5,10 Days to Faster Reading,Went through the whole book and found many useful reading strategies. I increased my reading speed and also found support for some long held beliefs of my own as to reading myths learned in grammar school.
4,Nice Book,I enjoyed this book on the subject of pendulums as I found it more realistic and to the point. I've own pendulums for some time now and use them often myself so I felt what Mr. Nielsen wrote could actually offer someone some useful information.
3,It's ok,It's ok. But I didn't get much out of it. It's more about the amazing things that the author has done with it that the how to.
3,New tool,This was a good drill/driver for light duty home use. The only downside was that you can not use with this drill the standard drill bits and sccesories. It accepts only hex end type accessories.
4,Just what I need,"I have a joint hypermobility problem and can't deal with heavy objects for any length of time. This drill is light enough that I can work with it for more than short periods.The angle adjustment is extremely useful although I wish it came with more bits. It has a decent amount of power for smaller jobs, but have come across jobs that it just can't handle.Overall, I am very pleased with this drill."
5,Amazing,"Ryan Adams is a true talent and I've enjoyed watching him grow and impress me with each release. COLD ROSES in no different. This album follows up his wonderful LOVE IS HELL album. Here we have 18 tracks spread over two discs, and it's unlike anything he's done before. I would list highlights but truthfully the whole thing is an experience. Not one bad track here. He has a beautiful voice and his lyrics are painfully honest and truthful. I wish more people knew about him, because a lot of people are missing out on a true talent here. Check it out!"
3,Channelling Jerry Gracia,"I was struck by how much Grateful Dead-sounding guitar can be heard on ""Cold Roses"" (especially on disc 2). I know that Ryan Adams is a huge (unapologetically) Dead fan, but, regardless of how good it sounds, it was almost overdone. I like Mr. Adams a lot and consider myself a pretty big fan, but he seems to be doing some mimicking (of artists he loves) lately. With ""Rock N Roll"" sounding very much like The Replacements and The Smiths, I'm wondering where his identity has gone.Regardless, ""Cold Roses"" is a nice cd to listen to. Mr. Adams has great voice and seems to have recovered from his wrist injury as gracefully as he is able. I'll continue to buy everything he releases, knowing that it will be solid and enjoyable."
2,Paid but did not recieve my book,"I am sure the product would have been great if I had recieved the book. I ordered it for a class, thankfully I know people in the class with the book. It would be nice to have the commentary or my monry back. Jesus is alive and reigning so its all good."
4,YUM,All I can say is YUM! Best spice mix I've every had. We got to sample them at a farmers market and came home to look them up and get more! The stew is our favorite!
1,Are you kidding me?,"I'm a Christian woman, married to a Christian man. I was reared in Christian home & attended Christian school.At the bottom of page 28, this book actually says that I'm ""to obey my husband as if he were GOD HIMSELF!!!"" It also says to accept what my husband says as if ""God were speaking audibly from heaven""! Are you kidding me?! Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Bible says to ""have no other gods before Me"".While I DO believe that my husband has the ultimate authority when there's a dispute, I DO NOT believe that I have no opinion & that my husband is infalible as God is infalible.This book is just absurd! It's not Biblical, although it trys to pass itself off as being that way.Don't bother wasting your time, unless you want a good laugh!"
5,This is a life-transforming book!,"The negative reviews below sadden me, because I was there once and used to think that ""submission"" was a dirty word. How I wish I had learned these lessons earlier on in my marriage; how much grief I would've saved myself! God is gracious. Through this book and godly authors such as Elisabeth Elliot and Elizabeth George, I am learning what it takes to be a godly wife who is pleasing to the Lord.Is it any wonder that the very first sin ever committed was by a woman who did not want to submit to her husband? Satan is still lying to women today. He convinces them that submission is restrictive, when the truth is that submission is freeing. ""You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."" (John 8:32)This book is worth its weight in gold. Do yourself and your marriage a favor and buy it, read it and most of all, APPLY IT to your life. You will be blessed. You will be transformed."
3,me?obeyhim?,"very interesting,good ideas for marriage. the man should be the head of the home. Always make sure the man or woman is a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ."
1,Unsound teaching,"Recently I read ""Me? Obey Him?"" and was very grieved at the content of this book. No where have I ever seen a miss use of the concept of submission as I did in this writing. It sounds like the old satanic doctine of a few years ago where if you have enough faith then even if your husband asked you to do something it will never happen for God will stop him. What happened to free choice and how God will not step over that? I will obey God rather than man anytime. Also if my husband asked me to do drugs I certainly would not obey him for that would be going against the law and God says to obey the laws of the land. I would not recommend this book too anyone because I think it gives you a license to sin and blame it on your husband."
5,Best Book on Submission,"Elizabeth Handford uses God's Word to present the reasons for a wife's submission to her husband. She shares all the blessings, joys and privileges that living a life according to God's plan will bring. A book every woman must read! The older edition is better. Her revised edition squirms on women trusting God if a woman is abused."
1,aweful sound and hard to fit,the sound is significantly worse in these headphones than others...and its a pain to fit in your ear.
2,Not very helpful,"As a person who has used a mechanical hackamore for years, I have hoped to get some tips that would help me get better results with my rig. What I got was a lot of history, explanation and promotion of a system that had little interest to me."
3,"Pricey, but nice","I was so looking forward to baking shortbread cookies with this beautiful mold. I heard that the ceramic ones were the original shortbread molds, and the best. However, I baked the cookies and the first ones came out fairly well although the little flower designs weren't all that prominent. The second batch I didn't bake long enough and when I went to unmold the cookies, they all crumbled and fell apart. I will try more later, but these were for holiday gifts so I didn't have a lot of time to experiment with different recipes. So, although the price is kind of high, it is a beautiful mold. My advise is to not underbake your cookies so they will stay together."
5,beautiful shortbread,"I love this mold! The pattern is beautiful and the mold has a substantial feel to it. My shortbread come out of it easily. I use Smart Balance margarine, though, rather than butter as I try to cut the saturated fat. They are delicious. Perhaps slightly richer with butter."
1,Don't attempt to buy this directly from Amazon !!!,HiI ordered this from Amazon on April 11th and at that time they said they will be delivering the product by May 21st. By June 21st they send an email saying that product is not yet in market so need more time and hence need my approval. So the delivery date was postpine to June 19th. Later they again said similar reason and postpone the date to July 17th and when I enquired about the reason through a web posting (the same product is readily available with Uncle Joe's in amazon) they said they will definitly deliver this time. But now (July 10th) I again received a mail asking me to authorise for a later date. This time is August 22nd. I again send a web posting asking for the explaination for keeping me waiting like this. Every time I get a automatic type reply saying the same thing. When I trust Amazon I expect some punctuality also from them. right?PLEASE ORDER THIS ITEM DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON ONLY IF YOU CAN WAIT FOR YEARS.
5,Great guide and now a great site,"This is a fantastic guide to MBA programs for non-geographically challenged Americans. The first part of the book discusses admission requirements, the objectives of an MBA and the results of a global survey with academics, students and alumni. The second part provides listings of over 100 schools, including the biggest and best in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.In addition, they have just launched a website alongside the print guide..."
5,DAVE,This is one great CD. I love live music and this one is so clear and clean it makes you feel that you are their watching him sing. If you like Elton John you will love this CD.
3,"Helpful, if you can get wade through all the unnecessary words","After reading through half of this book, I finally got to the part where it explains how to train your dog. Reading this book feels like you are in conversation with an extremely talkative 14-year-old. The author repeats himself over and over to the point where you feel like there are about 5 pages of useful information and the rest is just to fill the book. No economy of expression whatsoever. All that aside, there are diagrams illustrating how to train your dog which seem useful."
2,"Great Book, Terrible Translation","Maimonides' Guide is a masterwork of philosophic interest to Jews and non-Jews interested in the problem posed by philosophy to revealed religion, but Friedlander's translation is not the way to approach it. Besides removing the ambiguity of Maimonides' title by rendering it ""The Guide *for* the Perplexed"", he translates technical Rabbanic hermaneutical terms into awkward and sometimes inappropriate Latin 'equivilants'. Anyone who needs such translation won't be able to understand Maimonides' thought anyway, steeped in Rabbinics as it is; anyone looking to learn something of the Guide will be unable to do so with this translation. Shlomo Pines' translation is universally considered superior; be sure to get both volumes."
1,Awful!!!,An awful movie from start to finish -- truly painful to watch. Vincent Price gives the worse performance of his career and one of the worst in the film -- I can honestly say that no actor (or the sole actress) in the film was credible or even mildly entertaining. A terrible film.
3,Design problem,"The pot looks very nice, however, when you use it, too much steam and water comes out of the lid. Be careful when you use it."
3,A Popular Textbook,"This is a rather popular textbook because it clearly explains the Government and Binding Theory, though Chomsky prefers to call it the Theory of Principles and Parameters. There are quite a number of trees drawn for students to have a better understanding of the concerning structure, which usually lacks in other similar textbooks. This is particularly welcome by beginners since the analysis with squared brackets often makes new hands feel confused and even lost. It is also part of the reason why the book is so thick. The exercises are helpful for students to review what they have learned and to find out what concepts are not fully understood. This is the 2nd edition, which usually means it has a good readership. In fact, it is true."
4,So ladylike,"Some women think all men are dogs. Some women have been hurt by men. Some women seek revenge on their male counterparts who have wronged them. But, how many women would go to the extreme to rid the planet of smooth talking, womanizing players? The Lady Killer did.After his brother is killed, Jasper ""Jaz"" Ballantine has a score to settle with the Lady Killer. Hot on her trail, he and his psychologist ex-wife Dhana soon find that they are working on more than just the case.Filled with romance, a hint of suspense, and psychological thrills, Lady Killer by Gail McFarland kept me turning the pages not only to see if the killer was caught, but also if Jaz and Dhana could reconcile their relationship. It's not really what I would consider a ""mystery"", as the killer is revealed early on. Instead, I'd call it a worthy piece of supsenseful romance in which the characters are likeable and real, and the crime is deviant, yet possible.Reviewed by CandaceK"
1,"the most dumbest, most ill wrenching song of the year","I think that this song was really bad. Missy elliot, or should I call her the illiterate, fat homer of the 19th century. Her ""rymes"" do not even make any sense, I mean look at the title of the song. I do not reccomend this to anyone that is a loyal rap fan. She doesn't know how to write poetry and I think its really sad when i turn on the radio and she is number one or when i turn on Mtv and they have specials about her. I mean what is so great about a fat whale that says ""beep, beep, who got the keys to my jeep, vroom vroom?"" geez is this what America has come down to? i am very disapointed at anyone who likes this song and wish them well in the future."
4,Among the glut of Deep Purple live albums this is a beauty,"Deep Purple release a huge number of live albums - this is the third from the 1996 European tour I own (Live Encounters and Live At The Olympia are the other two). While too much Deep Purple is rarely enough, this set is a ripper. Ten tracks from a festival appearance (plus, confusingly, two bonus tracks from 2000 at the same venue), well recorded, the band in top form, and Steve Morse demonstrating the style that makes him a worthy Deep Purple guitarist. I buy almost everything Deep Purple put out, and I was very impressed with this one. Recommended."
4,Great movie that could have been even better,"John Houston's story of a young Union soldier who overcomes his fear of battle is wonderful. Audie Murphy's portrayal is stirring and quite lifelike, the movie doesn't portray any super human motives, but a simple soldier who is quite naturally scared going into battle and overcomes his fear. However, Houston doesn't allow Murphy's character to get into excessive machoism either, as he finds out that many of his comrades did the same thing he did, turn and run. Had the movie execs not chopped this movie up, it could have been even better. As it is, it's a bit too short and lacking in details such as the battles portrayed in the movie patterned after a real battle. The unit portrayed isn't even mentioned until the end of the movie. It would have been fun to follow Murphy's character's unit through the war."
1,The Red Badge of Courage,"The DVD did not work. I reported this and the company, inetvideo, said they would replace it but has not."
5,Every scene and aria from Don Giovanni is a highlight,"With the new lower price in a different pressing, why not just get the whole set? Every single scene and aria and ensemble in Don Giovanni is marvelous. And we all know that this cast is definitive. Do it."
3,"Great phone, fuzzy answering machine","I'm thrilled with the phone's quality - voices come through crystal clear and I've not yet found the corner of the house that loses reception. The handset is light and very nicely designed - I can cradle it between my shoulder and ear and not accidentally hang up the phone.However, the answering machine is another story. The voices are so garbled that it sounds as if all my friends have horrible colds or are holding a blanket over their mouths. I've only had one other digital answering machine, an AT&T; machine, and I wasn't thrilled with that one either. Perhaps digital hasn't been perfected yet."
2,Static after owning for one year,"This phone worked well for one year. Then I moved and kept it in storage for a few months. When I tried using it again, the phone was so staticky that most of the time I couldn't hear anyone, nor could the person on the other line hear me. Changing the channels didn't help at all. I basically don't even use it anymore because--even for 1-800 calls, I'd rather use my cell phone minutes than deal with the headache of listening to the static and yelling over the static and repeating myself."
5,no stick shaker,"With shakers in the past, the top tends to stick when opening. But not with this one. It looks great right out of the dishwasher. Nice looking & durable"
5,Allows the reader to feel the hardships and triumphs of BC men and women from the pioneer era to the modern day,"Raincoast Chronicles Fourth Five, Collector's Edition IV is a hardcover compilation of issues sixteen to twenty of ""Raincoast Chronicles"", a magazine begun in 1972 with the publishers' express intent ""to put BC character on the record"". Stories, poems, articles, drawings and black-and-white photographs of British Columbia daily life, livelihoods and culture, as well as recounting moments from history. Raincoast Chronicles Fourth Five allows the reader to feel the hardships and triumphs of BC men and women from the pioneer era to the modern day, and resonates with a tenacity of character and human spirit. Also highly recommended are the compilations of previous issues: Raincoast Chronicles First Five, Raincost Chronicles Six/Ten, and Raincoast Chronicles Eleven Up."
4,An opportunity to hear all of Saint-Saens' Symphonies,"In terms of the performances recorded on these CDs, I would be in favor of giving the album five stars; the reason I have chosen four stars is that the sound is somewhat dated, compared to the wonderful digital sounds recorded in the last fifteen or so years. It is still highly listenable, however, and the fact of being able to hear Saint-Saens' less familiar symphonies is terrific. The one entitled ""Urbs Roma"" is especially fine...........................Of course, I checked out the ""Organ"" Symphony and compared it with other recordings of that work that I have heard. Here again, the performance is limited only by the somewhat dated sound from the time period of the recording. All in all, I highly recommend the album, even though one can get recordings of Symphony No. 3 that are more in the ""blockbuster"" category, sonically speaking, than this one."
1,Entirely bogus,"The money-management system described in this book is bogus. You are guaranteed to lose using these techniques. To call this a ""winning system"" is fraudulent. You can't win, in the long run, at blackjack unless you count cards or use other similarly complicated techniques. If you play without counting, you're a sucker; if you buy this book, you're a sucker twice over. Good luck."
1,Don't waste your money,"The 5 rules he gives you do not work. His money management system has been used for decades. It is MATHEMATICALLY impossible to win at Blackjack without counting cards (without it being straight luck). It doesn't matter if you bet this many units or that many units...THAT DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE THE CASINO'S ADVANTAGE! If you are serious, learn to count. If you aren't, you may as well apply his system to any game Roulette, Blackjack, etc because once you get through all the common sense advice he provides, all this book is is a progressive betting system which can be applied to any 50/50 game."
2,Blackjack,"If you have never read a book on blackjack before, this one would be helpful. Otherwise, you have heard it all before."
2,i really wanted to like it.....,"well....you can tell that these guys really know how to use thier equipment....anyway....front242 is great, male or female just doesn't have what it takes. it's not bad...just boring."
5,Honeychurch Loves You,"Well the review I read in No Depression said this band was a mix of influences from Neil Young, Nick Drake, Mojave 3, the Byrds and Peter Bruntnell - it's true. Listen to the free MP3s on Amazon."
2,It Buzzes,"After less than two weeks of operation, the unit began to buzz very annoyingly. (Anyone remember what a 60 cycle hum sounds like? It was like that.) The only way to get the buzzing to stop was to physical unplug it from the wall. I called APC support an was told these units ""can have an audible hum"" and that any replacement unit would probably give me the same problem.I returned the unit today, as the noise was driving me crazy. Note: You have to contact a human at [...] to do so as their online return system does not work if you got stuff via Amazon. Let's see if I get the refund.I'm giving it two stars, rather than just one, because it did at least work with my computer, which is more than I can say for the last one."
1,Not new,"Described as ""brand new."" Was likely reconditioned. Was not to original specifications. We build custom machinery and put a UPS on each machine. These units were scrapped out at the customer location (export) and replaced with APC units from authorized distributors. My bad for looking to save a buck."
4,"Overall, very happy...","I am very happy with this setting, overall. The metal was a little bit thinner than I would have hoped, and I didn't realize that ""amazon.com"" would be imprinted on the ring... but overall I am very happy and would purchase this setting again (here's hoping I won't have to)"
4,pretty good,"it came fast and looks great but the texture of the grafic feels kind of rubbery, not enough to get in the way but still i give this a 4 out of 5 because of the texture but i got used to it after like 5 minutes of tricks"
5,Neoprene Swim Cap with chin strap,"This a very nice cap. You don't have to worry about it riding up or off. It does get warm, but will decrease with more usage."
3,not so good,the biggest problem with this book is the author. He got hung up on this killer & made up his mind that she did not kill her children. The only truth in this book is how the children's bodys were found & what the neighbor saw. Not a true story.A woman should have written this book.
1,Save Your Money,"I felt vaguely cheated...Pros:- Only $10 (shipping was free)- It is a neat ""idea""- The short song is clear if not loud.- The ""beating heart"" is well done, but its actually only a ""heart beat"" sound timed with a blinking light within the heart.Cons:- Overkill on the packaging. This thing was taped and twist-tied down within its own box. It took me 10 minutes to unpack it using a knife and needlenose pliers (for the twist-ties).- Battery compartment screw is inferior. It already looked stripped before I tried opening it. I finally used a straight-edge screwdriver. Another 5 minutes gone.- The arm for opening/closing the lid is partially busted; it only opens the lid.- The special effects (lip open, song, beating heart, etc...) activate when you insert a coin. But the coin sensor is cheap, so merely flicking the sensor door with your finger tip kicks off the special effects.- The chest interior looks cheap (i.e. poorly painted).- I think I got a returned/repackaged item."
4,Works well - my second unit,"The UPS works well and after a power failure the UPS starts up and the PC is configured to start up and boots up with all web, ftp and mail services running."
5,It's a keeper.,"This is an old black and white production, but it's very entertaining and also has an element of redemption. Based on a true story, sergeant York is a very unlikely hero, but he becomes the most decorated soldier in WW1. It's a keeper."
3,Sergeant York,"Still enjoyed the movie as much as ever; however, was not pleased with the sound quality as it faded in and out through the movie which did tend to be a distraction."
5,Sergeant York CD,So glad that this wonderful and inspiring movie finally made it to CD format. Wonderful quality. This is my husband's all-time favorite movie and it is definitely worth viewing again and again for the inspirational message it delivers.
3,Great CD,"If you are a fan of Bon Jovi or even just like a few of their hits, this album is for you. Some of the songs are somewhat corny, but generally speaking this is a great album. I can't wait to see them in concert in May!"
4,A decade of hits!,"CROSSROAD was released in 1994,ten years after Bon Jovi released their self-titled debut. Their first hit was RUNAWAY,then from 1985's 7800 FAHRENHEIT is IN & OUT OF LOVE. 1986's SLIPPERY WHEN WET,a megahit,brought LIVIN' ON A PRAYER,YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME and WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE. 1988's NEW JERSEY,another megahit,brought BAD MEDICINE,I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU and LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME. BLAZE OF GLORY,is frontman Jon Bon Jovi's solo hit from the 1990 movie YOUNG GUNS 2. From 1992's KEEP THE FAITH comes the title track and BED OF ROSES. Original tracks are ALWAYS,SOMEDAY I'LL BE SATURDAY NIGHT and a remake of LIVIN' ON A PRAYER entitled PRAYER '94. Total playing time for this CD is 72 minutes and 13 seconds."
4,Good Pop-Metal Indeed,"This is a great compilation, since it rounds most of Bon Jovi's best cuts on one album, to make for a very cool, catchy pop-metal package. Great Buy for anyone who likes 80s Rock, concidering Bon Jovi was one of the leading acts of the genre. While it has its share of mediocre material, the really good tracks here are excellent, which include:Livin on a Prayer, Someday I'll Be A Saturday Night, Wanted Dead or Alive [Kickarse], Lay Your Hands on Me, YOu Give Love a Bad Name, Blaze of Glory, and Bad Medicine."
4,One of the BEST American Rock bands! A very good compilation of their Hits!,"Even when my Rock music feedback is mainly based on British ""Classic"" and ""Heavy Metal"" Rock (i.e. Yes, ELP, Genesis, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, Jethro Tull et al), I must admit that Bon Jovi is, certainly, ONE OF THE BEST ROCK BANDS EVER (Made in America)!!!This album includes almost every known major ""Hit"" of this talented Band.No loss for your Rock collection!"
1,pathetic fake rockers,"i just can't believe how this band ripped me off. many people and the band themselves claimed to be 'hair metal'. nothing could be further from the truth. it would be impossible to call these guys rock, let alone metal. just because they dressed like motley crue and poison didn't mean they could ever amount to what the previous bands had. these square idiots predented to be heavy metal just to cash in on the late-80's hair metal movement. stay away from this piece of fake rock. a word of warning: THIS IS POP, NOT ROCK."
4,penmaric,Shipment was quick. Condition of the book was as promised--good. I would purchase from this seller again.
2,"So sad, what a waste","I looked forward to reading this book, and I was hoping to send it to my daughter. This book was for the New Age thinkers. I really did not care about the main character and felt her mentor was just another strange and nutty person who added no value. The more I read the less I liked the book. Do not waste you money. If you are looking for love, it will come be patient just don't waste your money or time with this non sense of a book."
3,Barbie-O-Rama,"Too bad there are no books ever published on ""9 Chickweed Lane"" other that that little one about a vain Siamese kitty doing silly kitty tricks without even emitting a single balloon.Just shove him aside with the foot and I will talk about the strip itself. It seems to be all about female vanity. All it features is flaunting how perfect and limber that blondie teen's body is as well as how young and sexy her mother still is. I think the girl is a slut-wannabe rubbing up against her nerd boyfriend and trying to make his hormones shoot off like fireworks. At least the grouchy old granny is there to break up the dreamy, wide-eyed fantasy world of prancing and galloping bimbos and their equally limber kitties."
3,Actually....,"When you read the book you'll find that he states on more than one occasion that a film he produced lost money. I guess it was more than a dime, so he ain't lying."
2,How To Be Paid For Telling The Same Thing Again And Again...,"...Without Adding Any New Useful Information About All The Flicks On Which Roger Corman 70's & 80's Reputation Is Built# Anyone Willing & Able To Tell Behind-The-Scenes Stories Regarding Naked Warriors, Death Race 2000, Galaxy Of Terror, Humanoids From The Deep, Battle Beyond The Stars, Screamers aka Re-Editing Of Sergio Martino's L'Isola Dei Uomini Pesce And Many Many Others?"
3,You'll Understand Corman Better,"To this day, I haven't seen one Corman film I've liked. Still, this book is a nice look into the world of low-budget producing. It gave me the opportunity to truly understand my disdain for Corman and AIP.Most of the book focuses on three or four of the productions Corman is most proud of. I would have preferred him spending additional time on his more obscure films. Teenage Caveman only gets a paragraph or two written about it.A documentary would have been a more appropriate format for this material than a book. It would have been much shorter that way at the very least. Then again, Corman always had a knack for dragging things out in his films. Ever seen Swamp Diamonds?The main theme of the book seems to be, ""Yeah, Corman's films were bad, but he did pretty good for what he had."" That doesn't take away the fact that they're bad films. Don't watch them unless you have a high threshold of pain."
3,"Not a 'how to"" book","Given the title, I was expecting more of a movie making manual type of book like ""Make Your Own Damn Movie"" by Lloyd Kaufman. It isn't. It's an autobiography, which was still interesting, just not what I was expecting."
3,Laramie-the first season,"I found the overall quality of this dvd set to be good with the exception of a few episodes where the quality of the video and sound were not very good. But this represents only a small portion of the toal episodes. John Smith and Robert Fuller were great in this series and worked well together. Young Robert Crawford Jr. was very good as well as the great song writer and composer, Hoagie Carmichael. There are some pretty good fight scenes through out the many episodes. I enjoyed watching this first season set and am glad to have it."
5,Great John Ford Western,I love John Ford westerns and wasn't disappointed with this one. Great group of actors and Monument Valley scenes make you appreciate how talented Ford is at telling a story. Adding John Wayne to the mix certainly didn't hurt. Recommended.
4,John Wayne at his best,John shows that he can do the good guy bad guy with beliveable style. It's one of his better movies although I'm a fan and think almost all his movies are good.
5,My favorite Christmas story!,"My favorite Christmas movie. It's an unconventional Christmas story, but wonderful story (it deals a lot with death, so it may not be appropriate for younger viewers)."
1,Motorola T5720 5 mile distance?,"Come on Motorola, you can do better..this model would make good for the kids in the yard to play with. Range is 1/2 mile if your lucky.. Need to change the range distance to that and get that 5 mile range of the package and spec sheet. Very discouraged with this model.."
1,"Interesting Premise, Nothing Else","This is perhaps the worst book I have ever read. The prose is sub-literate, the dialogue excruciating, the plot hackneyed, and the 'romance' trite. It could function as a parody of bad writing, I suppose . . ."
5,Excellent interpretations of death and dying.,"This book is a great mix of science fiction and fantasy used to paint an underlying picture of death that is complete in every aspect. Without ruining anything within this book, the character of death and the philosophical interpretations of death are examined as one man incidentally becomes death himself and travels through his new macabre role, gaining a deeper understanding of death and himself that you as the reader get to enjoy alongside him as you both come to your own conclusions about what death is and what it means."
5,"A very thought-provoking, intense story.","This book was great. I loved the whole series. With their exciting plots, and a hint of creepiness, they are fun-to-read stories. Besides the story alone, there are very deep philosophical ideas buried in the books. Be prepared to read interesting views on the afterlife and things not of this world."
3,"Suspensful book, but a liitle weak towards the end.","Zane, a poor man is cheated out of wealth and ends up killing death. Now Zane has to take all the responsiblities of Death."
3,just ok,"It was a very dry read. Lots of information about how some families came to the area, and lots of information about weather data, but not really much about how the communtiy was affected etc. Not enough material for a whole book? I was expecting something more like the ""Worst Hard TimeThe Worst Hard Time: The Untold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl"" which I much preferred."
4,this book should get more attention,"Wow, I really didn't expect to be as moved by this as I was. An important and well written account of a truly tragic event."
4,Historical Thriller!,"What an amazing read! Historical, true, and yet...how can it really be? That is what is so intriguing aboutthis book. With Grandparents and family who actually lived through this horrific blizzard, we now live in thispart of the country, and we know exactly how the weather can change so dramatically and so quickly! One day anda community is devastated...the next day, the sun shines on the survivors. Truly a dramatic, inspiring, incredibly detailed read...sure to be a reminder for us all how devastating the weather can be, with a mind of its own!"
4,Amazing historical non-fiction,"What an amazing telling of a terrible storm. Others have given the highlights of the story so well that I won't re-cap...I will say that I enjoyed very much the information about the immigrants; where they came from, why they came, what their lives were like, how they ended up where they did, what their values were, etc. The stories about the storm were amazing and kept me hooked on every word. I found the historical information about weather predicting a little dull. However, I gave the book to my dad and those sections were his favorites.In any case, a very interesting book."
4,Remember the children,The hardships endured by the unsuspecting pioneers is memorialized. An important history lesson that should be read by the children in today's world.
3,Basic History of Art,The book was in very good shape and was delivered before the date promised. I was very impressed with their service!
5,"Better than anticipated, but subtle.","Subtly effective fantasy drama - you never see the dancing caterpillar in the box, but the movie is about the people and how they react to the simple, almost insignificant miracle, and the relationship between the sneaky showman (unusually cynical role for Grant) and the boy who owns the caterpillar. Their relationship is wonderful except for one thing: Grant is trying to steal the boy's pet and sell it to Walt Disney, though he promised he wouldn't. For a mild, subtle story, the surprise ending is surprisingly satisfying. The DVD quality is fine."
3,Hugs and Kisses,"There is nothing extraordinary about this book. However, it does get you to think more about kissing which is important to any romantic relationship.I'd highly recommend The Romantic's Guide by Michael Webb. It has tons of creative tips and ideas."
2,Ehh,"Not what I expected. Heard something about this book from an incredible kisser. Maybe I found the wrong book or something, because it wasn't at all what I expected. If you're looking for techniques, forget it. If you're looking for ""quibble,"" you'll find it in this book."
2,Disappointing,"I personally didn't enjoy this book. It's printed on cheap paper, and it doesn't contain any photographs or illustrations, except for a few line-art pictures for decoration only. The bulk of the book describes 24 types of kisses.This book could be interesting for people who are in a romantic relationship who would enjoy reading about and trying out some different kissing techniques described."
2,Wish I hadn't wasted my money!,"This is one time I wish I hadn't listened to the other reviewers. I didn't find this book at all informative. It could be slightly entertaining at times but it is not at all educational. I had thought this was to give tips and specific instruction on kissing. I thought that this was meant to help improve ones kissing ability. It is kind of childish and it is not beneficial. It talks about kisses in general terms. It even talks about ""butterfly"" and ""eskimo"" kisses which is something that 5 year-old children utilize. I am not 5 years-old and I want some specific adult help to become a fantastic kisser. I don't know what else to offer as a substitute to this stupid book other than practice, practice, practice."
1,Im so dissappointed!,"I thought that this book is gonna be so helpful and interesting,,but nope,,not at all..it is so dump and boring,,Im so dissappointed,,,I cant beleive I wasted money on that,,Im sure gonna return this stupid book as soon as I can."
2,Philosophy of a bad b-movie!,"I am an admitted gore hound but I need a plot to go with it! The movie directors failed attempt to make a documentary-like movie falls exceeedingly short of the mark! The special effects are horrible, oddly reminicent of the cheesiest of 1980's ""weakest"" horror movies! Too much rubber and corn syrup!!!!! This is a sloppy, badly made, pathetically inane movie! The movie has its merrits....It put some actors to work! That's all I can say about this piece of ""chewy phlem"" disguised as a movie! I feel real horrible for the nameless people that these events occured to....and even worst about the mockumenaty that depicts their exit from this world! They deserved better!"
1,A deeply flawed movie about a deeply disturbing event,"I am quite familiar with Unit 731 and the aftermath and bought this movie in hopes that it would present some topics that I was unfamiliar with. Unfortunately, I found watching the movie extremely painful, not because of the topic material which I knew about but because of the overindulgence on visual and audio effects that were totally unnecessary. This could have been an outstanding docu-drama of one of the more sordid events in human history. Instead, it almost turned into a mockery of the events by making it into a horror movie. I was deeply disappointed."
1,Well..............,"This movie is an hour of documentary, an hour of bad horror, and 2 hours of pointless cut scenes of snow and none of it particularly good. The monotone delivery punctuated by dubbed screams, fake blood, and bad acting, is only surpassed by the amateur camera angles and ridiculous sound track. I bought this movie on the suggestion of a friend and regret doing so. It takes itself to seriously to even be watched as a good bad movie. Save your self the 4 hours and 20$, read the Wikipedia page on Unit 731 while watching meatball machine with the volume off."
1,Good and informative read!,"This was the second book I have read on the Laci Peterson murder case. The first was For Laci written by her mother Sharon Rocha. This book comes a close second to hers as far as information and the timeline of events. Of course, For Laci has more an emotional pull but Catherine Crier supplies some information that was not known. The book is a very interesting read if you are interested in this case. The only complaint I have is that there were very many mis-spellings and grammatical mistakes that sometimes interfere with reading. Other than that a very good book."
2,A Deadly Read,"To begin, I followed the Peterson Trail on Court TV. It was a fascinating glimpse into the trial, evidence arguments and conviction of Scott Peterson. I got closure from the trial. However, my wife bought this book for me as a treat. Some treat! I found this book to be tedious, tiresome, filled with contradictions and containing many typographical errors. Many others who reviewed the book say essentially the same. It seems to me to be a rushed bit of writing, and at times is mind-numbingly boring. In the last 25 pages, I found it almost impossible to want to read any further. But I did slog through to the end.There were a few interesting observations by Crier, a lot of speculation, some unseen evidence and a lot of police photographs. Crier refers to Peterson as a ""sociopath,"" which he apparently is.Most of America already knows at least 95% of what the book contains. You decide."
4,Book gives insight into the mind of a killer,"During the several days it took me to read this book, I found my mind wandering back to the incidents in the book while I was going throughout my daily activities. It was a fascinating book into one of the more news-covered events in the past several years. The details that Ms. Crier put into the book and the way she delivered them allowed me to get a small glimpse into the mind of Scott Peterson - a man who was convicted of killing his wife and unborn baby.The conversations that she details between Scott and his family, police investigators and his girlfriend are amazing. Ms. Crier puts a lot of background information in before the conversations and the story and sequence of events was much easier to understand because of this.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Scott Peterson case."
5,book: a deadly game by catherine crier,I ORDERED THIS BOOK: THE DEADLY GAME BY CATHERINE CRIER. I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRICE. I WAS GOING TO BUY THIS BOOK IN A BOOK STORE AND WAS VERY EXSPENSIVE. I COULD NOT AFFORD THIS BOOK. UNTIL I WENT ON LINE WITH AMAZON.COM. I ORDERED THIS BOOK AND CAME VERY FAST AND SHIPPING AND HANDLING VERY INEXPENSIVE.
4,A Mostly Unbiased Story,"Of all the books written on this case, this book is probably the best. Catherine Crier obviously did alot of research. The book spans from the beginning through the verdict, with much back ground information on Scott Peterson. It makes it easy for someone who didn't completely follow the case to understand how someone can be convicted on a mostly circumstantial case.The book is mostly fact-based. However, Ms. Crier does throw in her own opinion from time to time, including speaking out against the death penalty. Regardless, it took me only three days to read the book.If you are interested in the case, I highly recommend this book over any others."
4,"Fascinating info, but typos and errors bothered me!","A long-time fan of true crime stories, I picked this up at the Chicago airport to read on a long flight. And I'll admit, the first half intrigued me; I couldn't put it down. But as I continued to read, certain things--like calling Scott Peterson's Southern California hometown ""Solano Beach"" (instead of Solana Beach) several times--bothered me. It's so easy to do city and street fact-checks these days with Google. Since I'm from Southern California (where Peterson's parents still reside), I know many of the areas referred to in the book. If minor errors such as these were incorrect, it made me wonder what other errors were wrong as well. All in all, this was a good, entertaining, and informative read. I just wish it hadn't been so sloppily edited; for what they charge for hardcover books these days, this shouldn't happen--even if it IS your only entertainment on a long flight!"
3,Many Typos and Errors,"As an avid Court Tv watcher, I am very impressed with the intelligent reporting of Catherine Crier although during the Peterson trial I think they all at Court Tv were a bit too biased in implying Scott's guilt before the trial had reached a conclusion.About the book, it is very well written, but there are many errors and typos that are pretty obvious. I think the book could have been even better had more time been taken to review and proofread it (ie it gives Laci's age as 26 in one spot and 27 in the other, this type of error is all over the book and takes away from its effectivness and credibility). All in all though, I think it gives us a closer look at who Scott actually is and who Laci was, but still has not convinced me that Scott is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on my opinion that Court TV was biased during the trial aside from Beth Karas, she was fair in her reporting."
3,"Fine for playing DVDs and MP3s, not so good for Audio CDs","I had no problem playing DVDs on this unit. It worked fine. I also had success with MP3 CDs. I was able to browse the directory structure of the CD and play the desired albums or tracks.However, Audio CDs are another story. I regularly make CDs of live material, which I edit on my computer, burn to CD, and audition in my living room. When I played one of these CDs on the Zenith, I was dismayed to hear gaps between the CD tracks, with the first 1-2 seconds of each track missing. Thinking that it might be the CD writing software, I wrote another CD with a different program. Same gaps and skips. Finally, I tried a pressed music CD, with similar results.If you intend to play audio CDs on your DVD deck, you should probably look elsewhere."
5,An engaging book for movie fans.,"This is a very informative book. I am a fairly new fan of Audie Murphy's, and in reading this book I learned a great deal about him. Not only does it cover Audie's filmography, but it also goes into his life and his military career. I especially enjoyed the sections that gave some background stories on each movie and all the great pictures. This is a wonderful book that every Audie Murphy fan should read. Sue Gossett is an insightful and talented author. She definitely does justice to the memory of Audie Murphy with this book."
3,Picture and item don't match up,"I liked how speedy the delivery for my item was, ordered on Monday and received it on Thursday. The material is very nice but my problem is the color of the tie. I was expecting the tie to look the way it was in the picture. When I opened the package, it was a much darker tie, more dark purple/blue mix if anything. Regrettably I have to return this item because I needed the one shown in the picture, not a darker looking tie."
1,Don Lapre junk,"Remember Don Lapre? He filled the TV airwaves in the 1990's with infomercials on how to get rich. Anyway, this is just one of his many 'get rich quick' scam books that he pawned off on millions of Americans. Don't waste your time with anything he's involved with. If you want to get rich...Don Lapre is NOT your mentor. LOL"
2,Falls short,"This book and its sequel are engaging but ultimately disappointing. They are page turners, I'll grant, with some very nice insights into the way people function and the characters are colorful and likable. But the books are marred by inaccurate and implausable details regarding the horse world, genetics, and Navaho culture. Worse, there is a jolting mis-use of language. An editor should have corrected such clunkers as ""the lizard jettisoned to a safer rock."" That's not poetic, it's just wrong, and it spoils the credibility of the narrative."
2,HENDRIX NOT THAT GREAT,"When I first heard that Jimi was great, I went out and bought this CD. Needless to say, I NEVER LISTEN TO IT ANYMORE! I PERSONALLY DO NOT LIKE HENDRIX AND IF I WAS TO PICK MY FAVORITE GUITARIST, IT'D DEFINATLY BE ERIC CLAPTON! If you want some real blues or great rock, get any Eric Clapton album from 1974-1977 and ""Crossroads 2: Live in the '70s"" FORGET HENDRIX, CLAPTON AND STEVIE RAY RULE!"
1,He sucks!,"I've hated Jimi Hendrix ever since my neighbors told me how he was the greatest musician of all time. This crap is terrible and proves that just because you can get blown out of your mind on acid and play the national anthem with a guitar and pop can as a pick, doesn't mean you can write good timeless music. Jimi's dead and i wish he would've taken his crappy overrated music with him!"
5,Hendrix at his best,"Wow...what a great selection of Hendrix songs. My favorite is ""Foxy Lady."" This song brings me back to my high school years. Yes, I'm nearly 50. I've been playing the tracks over and over and I can't say there is a bad song on the disk. If you like some good guitar cords, this disk is for you."
4,Say what!?,"This CD is no difrent from ""The Ultimate Experience"" CD. Both Cds have 20 tracks and both cover all the ""Greatest hits."" That is why I only give this 5 star music a 4 star rateing:( The man is the master of the guitar!! Don't cheat us like this people!!!!!"
5,this is a great album,I loved every song on this album.Hendrix rocks!He is the greatest guitar player ever.
5,The Greatest Rock and Blues Guitarist Ever,"The man is a legend and this album includes some of his finest work ever. From his brilliant take on Billy Roberts' ""Hey Joe"" to his definitive use of the wah-wah pedal on ""Voodoo Child (Slight Return)"" this is an album of brilliance. Hendrix's influences are clearly shown on the brilliant ""Red House"" as he shows he can write a blues tune to the standard of his heroes and the beautiful ""Angel"" shows Jimi at his emotive best. For anyone with music taste this is a must buy."
3,more like 3 1/2 stars,"I bought this for a few reasons. Reason 1:PURPLE HAZE. Reason 2:ALL ALONG THE WATCH TOWER. Reason 3:IF 6 WAS 9. Reason 4:STONE FREE. Reason 5:FIRE. Reason 6:AND THE WIND CRIES MARY. Reason 7:FREEDOM.This CD isn't really Jimi's greatest hits. It's some of his greatest from ELECTRIC LADYLAND and ARE YOU EXPERIENCED. But I'd probley given it a ful 5 stars if it had MACHINE GUN on it. Anyone who has heard MACHINE GUN knows what I'm talking about. It's just the way Jimi makes his guitar sound like a M-60 machine gun that gets me everytime. To me, that's his greatest hit.This is however a good starter disc for newbie Hendrix fans. But for God's (or Jimi's) sake, don't let this be the only Hendrix CD you buy. Because if it is, your missing out on a lot.WALKMAN2527"
3,Not fit for a true fan,"How can you enjoy Hendrix in only twenty songs? This CD is good,but how can they leave out songs like ""are you experienced"" and ""voodoo chile?"" I suggest buying all three of his original albums: Electric Ladyland,Are You Experienced,and Axis:Bold as Love."
5,One of my favorite Gundam stories,"Gundam seed is one of the more modernized Gundam entries. The 2 previous shows, Gundam wing and 08th MS Team were pretty good. Gundam Wing had okay animation, but the voice cast was bad on the english dub. 08th MS Team has ok voice acting, but the animation was kind rough. Gundam Seed has neither of these problems. It has really good animation and pretty good voice acting. The soundtrack is also really well done. The story is also more interesting. There are some major plot twists and some great conflicts between the characters. It definitely deserves the 2 seasons that it ran. With lots of great characters, a pretty in depth plot and high quality production it's definitely my favorite Gundam since the original. You should give it a chance. I hope you like it as much as I do."
3,GSD.......meh,this series did not need to be made. Gundam Seed was pretty good. but everything good about it was undone by seed destiny. i only bought this because i want to have every iteration of gundam on dvd. luckily this was on sale for $20 one day so i snagged it.i cant really recommend this series because it sucks.go buy G Gundam or stardust memory instead.oh btw the packaging sucks. 5 discs inside a single dvd case??? i hate having to take out a disc to get to a disc...no thanks
4,good product poor set up process,"This battery pack boosts back up time substantially. The documentation that comes with the battery pack says that you should use the included 3.5"" ""floppy"" disk to load a MS-DOS (pre-Windows) program to tell your XL series UPS that it has an additional battery pack attached. I had no computer with a floppy disk drive and have not used MS DOS since the 1980's. APC support directed me to a FTP Internet download version of the MS DOS program. What I discoverd on my own is that the Business Edition of the UPS Powerchute that comes with XL series UPS's has the ability to set the number of battery packs. Why hide the best method of configuring the battery pack and force customers to use an ancient process to do the same thing?"
5,Moen is a great company,"We have had a Moen kitchen faucet of well over 10 years. During that period, they have replaced the inner cartridge free of charge. Their customer service is outstanding. Most recently, our Moen faucet started to wobble on the base due to the deterioration of a part under the sink counter. After all this time, Moen customer service sent the part free of charge to rebuid the faucet. As it turned out, the refurbishing of the existing faucet was not possible. So they sent for a nominal fee an entire new faucet assembly as an replacement. Tell me where there is better customer service than that. With that kind of customer care, I am a Moen customer for life as well as my family members who are impressed with the all around consumer care."
4,This product worked well.,"I thiink that this is a good product. After purchasing from Amazon, I found it cheaper at walmart. It is nearly half the price that amazon is charging. As far as my dishwasher goes, it is quieter and it is definitely cleaner and smells great! I would buy this product again. I will just be getting it from walmart."
1,Severly disappointed,"This did not work for us at all, not even a little bit. Maybe it works for others and that's great but for me it was a waste of money.It wouldn't be so bad if it had even half way cleaned our dishwasher but it didn't even do that. Next on the list is trying the FinishDishwasher cleaner, hope I get better results because I'm sick of white chalky residue on my black cooking utensils."
4,Home products,"I have been using this product for many years and have had great results. I have this item under sink and lasts for a complete year of great tasting drinking water, better than bottled water."
1,Taken,"The only thing ""taken"" was me for handing over my money for this book. I did not watch the TV show and picked up this book at the airport just to have something to read.Absolutely terrible. Shallow and immature. The book is like an fragmented outline. Do yourself a favor and read something else."
1,"Love Cook, but this book is bad",My review is simple. I've read and liked all of Cook's other books. This one is absolute garbage. It's contrived. It's boring. The ending is boring. I disliked it intensely. It was a waste of my time. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.
4,On par with the movie.,"I read the book before watching the movie, and I must say that it is almost like reading the movies script. The only exception is the ending. The book ends leaving you hanging. It leaves out about the last 15 minutes of the movie.If you like books about aliens this is for you. I thought it was well written, and I really liked the characters.I wouldn't bother reading it though if you have seen the movie already.I recommend for Sci-fi fans."
3,very heavy,"This is very sturdy but much heavier than I expected. Because of it's weight, I am wondering how useful it will be to use above me on my steep roof. I am also going to look for a lighter and shorter tool."
4,A Star To My Father,"A star to my father is one of my favorite his play. Not on this album...... When I was in my country, his reputation was so good. But here, America, some my American friends who say I'm the Jazzmania never know about Thierry Lang. They just know American Jazz. Are there no Jazz outside of this country?????? Even one of the first book about Jazz was published in France and in Japan, Jazz is more popular than in America among young generation also old people. You guys have to listen what they are playing now and before out of your country. Evrything is changed about Jazz. Thierry's music is like the breeze on the top of the hill.... Just feel and let you take a rest with his paly... Everything'll be changed...."
4,"Great book overall, horrible binding","Just want to add, beyond any comment on the material inside, that the binding is horrible for Penguin paperbacks, meaning that the pages are not evenly cut and stick in all directions at the end of the page starting from the glued part. Every Penguin paperback I've ordered from Amazon suffers from this..."
5,"If you're going to spend several weeks with this book,","and why wouldn't you?, choose this edition. Paper stock, type face and wide margins matter with this whale of a novel. Oh, and the text itself? Remember: Melville is funny. A poet to boot. At some point, two- or three- or four-hundred pages in, I always seem to find myself adrift, joyfully cut loose, swimming in language."
2,Penguin Island,"78 page printing error in middle of book. printing went from pages 1-200, 200 back to 123, then 201-finish."
1,not even close,wont insall on my computer never buy this it sucks i have a newer computer it wont load to it so waste of money
4,Fantastic!,It couldn't of been any better. I was able to get the book on time. The condition like new was more than right. The book was flawless. Very pleased by its condition and price.
4,good book,This book is a very easy to read and very informative. If you are looking to quit drinking this book will help!
1,AA is NOT A RELIGIOUS PROGRAM!,"I wish that the people who are advising alcoholics or addicts about treatment methods would not persist in wrongly calling AA a religious program. The AA literature clearly states that is not a religious program, rather a spiritual one. A simple explanation of the difference between religion and spirituality was given to me at a meeting: religion is for those who are afraid of going to hell; spirituality is for those who have already been there."
1,Insulting,I believe this book is insulting to AA. The book could have had a different title. The author is saying his idea's are better than those of another human. PLEASE: GO TO AA. IT HAS WORKED FOR ME AND I AM ONLY 17!
1,Money making scheme.,"At first I thought this author was trying to ""re-invent the wheel"", ""make a better mouse trap"". But what he's really doing is creating a name for himself, feeding his ego, by turning to the negative. If ""Higher Power"" or ""God, as I understand Him"" bothers him, maybe his problem is bigger than he thinks. He may need more help. Perhaps reading the ""Big Book""? I really hope that those looking for help with their alcoholism DON'T read this book. It could be fatal.I suppore his next book will be ""Using the Bible to Blow Your Nose In"". To the author: get real, get to a meeting!!!"
1,"Incredibly, incredibly awful","We are not intimately familiar with the ""Thomas"" franchise, but my son selected this book from his preschool library and I read it to my children that afternoon. We were treated to random point-of-view shifts, under-developed storylines, confusing chains of events, and pathetic moralizing. I only read the first story aloud, as the kids lost interest. I read the other tales to myself in the manner of someone unable to pull her eyes away from a car accident. If this book is par for the ""Thomas"" course, I'm glad we've missed the train."
5,A 'must' for all of us,"If you are a serious student of this teaching, you simply have to own this book. It has everything you need, including theory and details for the daily practices."
4,work fine,"not well made, but does what it suppoded to do. Some punch rings are irregular, not perfectly round, but overall it's a handy tool to make additional holes on your belt."
1,Weak,"One punch came to me slightly bent. One other bent after several times using it. It is still useable, but not as sharp as clean as it should be."
3,Several holes in one,"It beats going to the shoemaker for an added belt hole, or trying to do it some other dumb (wrong) way.This works fine for occasional use.(If you add holes to a belt it looks waaay better (to me) if you add all of the in-between holes --- and gives you that micrometer-comfort factor! (Especially if you have the need to tuck things inside the belt ...)"
5,Excellent Product,"Excellent product, sharp enough to cut through dual layered leather belt. I got this belt in 3 days. I have no complaints. It's working so good."
2,Anvil is a problem,"I just bought this today, and it doesn't work well for me. I do a lot of leather crafts, and I couldn't even get it to cut a thin piece of leather. The anvil (I'm assuming that's what it is...this circular piece of metal that the punch meets when you squeeze) gets in the way...the punch cuts the top of the leather just fine, but does not cut all the way through to the bottom. If the anvil was out of the way and the punch went through the hole the anvil is attached into, perhaps that would work. I'll be returning this item."
1,Broke after 1 use,It broke after one use on a belt. I should have followed the reviews and avoided this one but I didn't. Don't make the same mistake I did. It broke on the second hole I tried to make in a belt. Will be returning tomorrow.
1,Doesn't work on vinyl,"Ordered this to repair some vinyl overshoes occasionally at work. The vinyl is thin material and you can poke a hole with a screwdriver or nail easily. I wanted neater holes punched to set various sized grommets. The various punches deformed the first time I used it and the entire device broke apart. If it would not work on thin Chinese vinyl, it certainly would not have punched leather with any degree of accuracy. Save your money and look for a good, American made leather punch. The item I received was junk."
1,Leather hole punche,"Terrible quality, unsteady, makes irregular holes and does not stay in same position after punching the first time. It ruined my belt. Is ti made in China? probably..."
5,Love It!,Great product - I love the price and the quality of this product. I am working on a variety of projects and love this tool! My husband has been losing weight and it will help to add more holes to his belt too!
1,Not what I was hoping for.,"I have two fully metal leather punches right now that are dulling out because of use, so I thought I would get a new one that would work better. Nope. It works about as well as the duller metal one. Heavy duty my hind end...The ONLY redeeming quality is that the handles are more comfortable, but even then, you have to push down harder, which renders that null and void because it feels the same as using the metal ones."
3,"sturdy mechanism, difficult to use on heavy leather","This punch is offered in a familiar shape. Initially, it is very difficult to rotate the center ring on which the various punch tubes are located. It may get easier to use over time. Mechanism is stable, but it was difficult to punch heavy leather (3/32 in thick). If you have patience and a fair amount of grip strength, this is a good product,"
2,Hole punch,Tool edge wears out fast. Not for long term use. Lasted for only one project for me. I do not recommend.
2,Really bad,I didnt like this at all puch comes out really badI might as well use my drill to make the hole
2,Hard Work,"I bought this book taking into account the authors work and standing, however, I found it hard work in as much for me it left little to the imagination, I like to imagine some of my own scenarios and locations etc while reading a book (perhaps it is just me). With this book it was so detailed at times I found it like watching paint dry. It was one of those books where after reading perhaps 50 or 60% I felt like giving up but took the view I have invested this much time I may as well finish"
5,Finally found this!,"I looked all over to find a replacement blade for a 30"" bow saw that was my grandfather's, Home Depot, Lowe's, etc. Nobody had anything bigger than a 20"" blade. Finally found this online, including shipping it was less than $8. Fits perfectly, very sharp, I am well pleased."
4,Nothing new really.,"This is the import CD of At The Drive In's new single, Rolodex Propaganda. It has the version of Rolodex Propaganda off Relationship of Command, a BBC cut of One Armed Scissor (w/ Iggy Pop on backgroundvox), and Extracurricular which was featured on the split with Sunshine. This is pretty much only for the fan who has a compulsion to own everything At The Drive puts out. The highlight of this is definetly hearing Iggy Pop back up At The Drive In. So, if you have Relationship of Command, I'd pass on this. But if you're a diehard obsessive, then get this before it disappears forever."
5,Wow,"I was expecting line drawings of the plants similar to the edible plants guide, but this has color photos of almost every plant listed in it! It's absolutely great!"
3,"small pics, not enough directions","Many of the pics are so small that it makes it hard to identify many of the plants/flowers. It would have been much better if they had made the book wider and longer so they could use larger pics. i understand that it's small in order to be handy to take into the field with you. But i would rather be able to see what i am looking at. i can handle a larger book. Many of the pics are on DIFFERNT page from the description which is very confusing!!! If you get the book, make sure you match up the pic with the right description! Then there are not enough details on HOW to use the plant. Ok, i know what it is, but how do i use it?????????? Those those are the 3 bad things about the book. However, i still recommend it because it gives over 300 plants including photos, which some do help. The index is excellent. And the back cover doubles as a ruler. The book is better for those that are not beginners."
5,Great little field guide,This is a great little field guide. Packed with good information. I read this front to back and am happy to add this to my library of books on this subject.
5,Medicinal Field Guide,This book is great! It is one of the few books I use for references. The pictures are great quality.
1,hated this book,"I very seldom hate a book, but this one I did. The hero was a worthless human being, he was Constantly belittling and verbally abusing the heroine. And I didn't like how he had sex with other than the heroine and I say sex because it certainly could not be called making love when he did. And she was beyond stupid, she put up with all his name calling and she never thought before she jumped into anything, which I also found tiresome. The two of them deserved each other, as I didn't like either one of them. I kept reading hoping they would both have a great personality change but they never did. So, I finally just tossed it in the 'To Donate bag'. Good riddance!"
4,Not quite complete Starts at chapter 26,"While the download is great, the history does not begin until chapter 26. I rather start at chapter 1 and then proceed as ordered."
1,incomplete set of books,"The books were advertised as a COMPLETE SET OF 7 volumes. The box arrived intact with only 6 volumes - volume 5 was missing. I contacted the seller and she doesn't know where volume 5. She reembursed me $28.00 for the book, but my set is still incomplete! I'm very dissappointed."
3,Pretty!,"Bought 3, one for my tiel, lovie, and budgies. All of them love this toy. My only problem is that my lovie managed to take hers apart within a day. =\"
4,Sony TCM-400DV,"this is a very good recorder considering the price, the battery life is less than I am used to but since it is cassette based it takes more battery power to to rewind etc. that a fully digital recorder with no moving parts.A nice variable speed unit for a very good price."
4,Sharp middle-period McLean record with lots of appeal,"There are some great songs on this album, whether it's the clever title track, the reflective When Love Begins or the manic Jump. Plenty of variety too. It's only in songs like When a Good Thing Goes Bad (prophetic perhaps) that we see signs of McLean's impending slide into Drivelsville. Highly recommended."
1,Hmm,"After reading some of the other reviews on ... this book seemed like it would be worth while having......Its not. It has some spells in it but most of it is really random and takes roots in a more ceremonial magick tradition giving a few black and white illustrations of some talismans which by the way are poorly copied and hard to even see the details of. I really enjoy alot of the Anna Riva books and many of them have alot of information in them, but this is not one of them.I do want to add that at the end of this book are some lists of herbs and uses for them, this is a nice addition to the book and is worth having. At best, its a good thing this book only costs five dollars.JetToledo Ohio"
4,Maple and Linear Algebra,"you'd think this market niche would only be served by Matlab but you can do plenty of matrix algebra on Maple. and since i know a little bit about Maple and Linear Algebra and practically nothing about Matlab it was the perfect book for me. it says it's a first linear algebra book and it covers that stuff, but it also gets into singular value decomposition and all the stuff in between. the few proofs i've read are constructive and easy to follow. and it's great getting Maple to do the calculations and help visualize this very abstract set of ideas.i've got the 2001 edition so it could use an update with the newer Maple syntax, but it uses the LinearAlgebra package as opposed to the old linalg, and everything in the book works on my Maple v13.this is a very helpful book, especially if you're into Maple."
3,Enjoyable but could be better,"The Matrix is a movie that is good, but could have been so much better. Essentially they needed a plot that could carry the main point of the movie: show awesome special effects that are not possible in the real world. Main point achieved. This movie has some truly remarkable scenes that left me stunned.However, good dialogue and plot could have really carried this movie to a whole new level. Without giving away the central idea, the secret of ""What is the Matrix?"" is silly. There are many reasonable alternatives that could have made the movie more believable and even thought-provoking (I bet you can think of at least three). As it is, whenever people talk, sense they do not make.See this movie, because it is fun. That said, it was painful for me to watch this movie a second time knowing what it could have been."
4,Digital Dreams or Reality...,"Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), alias Neo, is a computer programmer by day and a hacker by night who is not getting much sleep due to troubled thoughts. One evening Neo receives a message on his computer and later a strange phone call from a different hacker who goes by the name Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). This is the beginning of a complete turmoil related to Neo's existence and he is thrown into an adventure unlike no other ever created, no pun intended. Matrix is a clever science fiction story that triggers reflection in regards to our existence and values, which can be experienced through fast paced action packed entertainment."
2,PLOT HOLES!,"An enjoyable movie, but damn! I hate glaring plot holes. For a thinking man, it just spoils the entertainment value.What was up with the phone thing? Why did they have to go across town to beam out? Why couldn't they just use their cellular phones?And why use humans for you-know-what? Why not use cows? They are bigger (more bio-matter) and dumber (the matrix then could consist of only bales of hay and those flies that suck the juice out of the corners of their eyes).Why choose small firearms, when they could've had RPG's or grenade launchers?How can they see so well when they wear those sunglasses all the time?How can it always be 1999 if the people are going about their normal lives? Do they wake up after New Year and start all over again? Or do they just get extremely wasted and forget the previous year happened?I could go on, but its 2am, and I just finished listening to the Matrix Soundtrack (which rocks!)"
3,thinking man's king fu,"A lot of fun. The inner working of computer code, far into the future, when programs are represented from within by humanoid characters, who in turn monitor the sleeping humans who live as well inside the simulation, as they sleep in reality.A group of humans attempt to break out and mayhem ensues. Plenty of analogies to real current day programming techniques, and when taken as a trilogy, a fair amount of pholosophy running quietly in the back ground. Also, the trilogy will have tons of surprises---this movie is actually quite intellectually impressive.this movie is just fun!!!I am planning on getting the trilogy when it comes out as a boxed set early 2004."
2,Escaping the Matrix,"This movie bites off a bit more than it can chew. It wants to pose the question: what is really real? It also wants to make us think about the meaning of our lives--a point overlooked by almost all reviewers.--Are we just cogs in a tremendous impersonal machine that is the world? Are we no more than fuel that sustains civilization? What is this civilization? And who is it for? Of course, these are all good questions. Too bad the characters in this movie are flat and the acting is mediocre. I felt no sympathy for any characters in this contrived and predictable film. And I felt relieved when it was all over."
2,"cool, however...","Yeah, like the other 1,500 people who reviewed it, I thought the film was cool; especially the philosophical issues it raised. HOWEVER, this WAS sadly another American film that completely perpetuated the glorification of gratuitous violence. Yes, the ""matrix"" and hackers and all is VERY cool, but walking through buildings killing as many security guards as you can find is NOT cool. Can anybody say ""Columbine""?"
3,it was...good,"The Matrix was a good movie but it was far from great. The hype over Matrix 2 is way over blown. I just don't like it when a movie's strongest point is it's special effects. The Matrix storyline takes a backseat to the ""wow"" factor. It's filled with bad acting and poor matrial arts scenes. The specal effects are neat for the first 20min but get old. How many times does somebody jumping in slow motion look cool? One."
5,very good action and terrific special effects,The movie was great. Very good special effects. Plot was a little sketchy and could have been explained easier
5,Fabulous,"Well, honestly, I really didn't want to see this movie one bit, until a friend made me sit down and watch, and am I ever glad he did. Of course the special effects are amazing, but that isn't what makes a movie. What makes a movie is such an intricate and seamless storyline, which this movie really carries. It has a strong psychological aspect, which many will enjoy, not to mention all out action, which all the rest will love. Overall, one of the most thought provoking and wonderful movies I've seen in a long time."
3,Time to take the Red Pill,"""The Matrix"" is a reality-twisting story of a programmer (Keanu Reeves) who finds that the world he lives in isn't real at all. An interesting story is made all the better by some truly inventive action sequences and the great special effects (most notably the chopper crash and ""bullet-time"" effects). This is one for the library. Check it out."
5,One of the best action movies of all times,"This movies has it all, ground breaking visual affects, great fight scenes, jarring sound, decent acting and a great story. This is my favorite action movie of all time to date."
5,Best movie Ever!,I love this movie. It will remain my top pick for a very long time. My only complaint is not seeing it in the theatre.
5,Classic,Everyone in the world should own this film - it is packed with extras and is quite simply one of the greatest films of the past 5 years
4,Very glad I got this..,I actually rented this movie before hand.. and loved it.. Then I saw it on this website and had to buy it.. Very imaginitive.. Damn good effects.. Very interesting story line..
3,"A good, entertaining movie","A very slick, clever movie though not as profound as many would have you believe. The story is a familiar one - a man is the chosen one but must discover and believe in himself first - but the backdrop for it is vastly more interesting than most similar movies and the special effects are both excellent and well-used. There's a lot that is hastily explained and a pretty pointless, romantic subplot but, depending on what you expect from an action/adventure/scifi movie, there's nothing that detracts from it too much. For those that enjoy the genre, I certainly recommend it."
3,It was alright,"This is definitely a guy's movie, but still is actually not to bad. I like the premise of the movie, but Keanu is just a little bit to skinny and pale for my personal taste. I'm not impressed with his acting either. Other than that the movie's good, I would recommend watching it to anybody; it's worth the time. Rent it first before you buy it though."
4,"Good, but underdone in some areas and overdone in others","The Matrix, while having solid characters and decent special effects, lacks the depth that makes a movie good. On the surface you say a pretty good movie, however, you are always on the outside looking in. Unlike other thrillers of its genre, it fails to suck you in and keep you alert the entire movie. Also, occasionally the special effects were overdone and, truthfully, boring."
4,"Video quality much improved over DVD, but no 7.1 Audio","I purchased the Blu-Ray version of Matrix even though I had the DVD to watch this movie in all it's High-def goodness. I did notice the difference in the video. The details in the faces of the characters is crisp. The action sequences were stunning. This movie is visually appealing. Although the audio is uncompressed 5.1, I was hoping there was a 7.1 audio track. Even in Dolby TrueHD, I was hoping for more surround effects. Still, it's worth the purchase. This movie was a breakthrough when it came out, and if you're a fan, it's definitely worth the purchase. But wait until Amazon has a sale."
2,"Hard to understand, bad concept.","The Matrix starts off faast and gradually gets slower and slower to the point when you say, what the heck is going on. Sure the story is um...intersting but overall I was just disapointed in the end. Felling that I wanted more. The special features kept me busy, but unless your buying this for the special features look somewhere else."
5,The most awesome Sci-Fi flic I have ever seen.,"The Matrix is rich in awesome special effects and the cast was chosen perfectly. Although I'm not a huge Keanu Reeves fan, I thought he was perfoect for the part of Neo. The writers did a perfect job with the timing and delivery of explaining what was going on in the movie. I've seen it three times and after all this talk about it, I want to rent it tonight. I feel sorry for the people who have a hard time following and understanding the story, they're missing out on a great story. Overall, the combination of the story line, actors, and special effects, make this movie great!"
3,Matrix,"I guess The Matrix beats most of the ""dumb downed"" rubbish spewing out of Hollywood. BUT if you want to see a really good SF, do yourself a favour and check out David Cronenbergs new movie, eXistenZ. This is a much better movie with an intriguing story, good acting and the wonderful organic touch of Mr. Cronenberg."
5,The Matrix,The Matrix is a great movie. I ordered it and it arrived in good time and in good condition. I am happy with the service.
5,Great movie,this movie was a well planned out movie... I admitt it did have some boring parts but what movie doesn't. I rated this movie a 5 because it has a lot of great action parts. and the affects were great.
2,DVD pausing ruined the film,I very muck liked the movie when I went to see at the theater. But when I bought it on DVD. The pausing through out the movie kind of made you mad. I would not buy it on DVD.
4,Extraordinary on DVD!,"This movie may have one of the most complicated plots there ever was, but it looks amazing on DVD! It is a must have for every DVD player. The graphics and the breathtaking special effects look great! Personally, I didn't understand the story very much until my aunt explained it to me. Anyway, it is a great DVD experience to have."
5,the Godfather of sci-fi,"This is what I consider the greatest sci-fi movie of my generation. Visually, it is spectacular to see on the big screen. I remember the first time I saw it, I had to come back to the boxoffice and pay for another ticket, immediately after I exited. I don't remember ever doing that ever and again. I was that stunned by the visuals and the storyline. Before all the imitations arrived, this movie had it all, mind-blowing special effects and an absorbing premise about the future that is both scary and quite probable. I'm not so taken by the sequels though, but that's understandable, this is quite a tough act to follow."
5,"Buy this movie now, if you don't hace it yet","Everything on this film is great. The actors are setting new standards. There is no boring sceen in the whole film. That's may be why I've watched this film four times by now, still looking forward to the next time. Visual effects are ""the crown"" of the story. Great, just great film."
5,"In my opinion, the best action movie ever!","This movie has everything and action movie fan could want. Lots of guns, special effects, explosions, lots of fighting, good acting, and dare I say a good plot. It puts an interesting prospective on our world and it puts a new demension to action movies. It's just cool how they can run up walls, and dodge bullets.If you like action with a good plot, then get this movie!"
4,Great Movie,"The Matrix is a great movie and is extremely well done, however, I experienced that it wouldn't run on all DVD players. I took it back in exchange for the VHS version but was greatly disappointed that the DVD wouldn't run on my player. The movie is great though and well worth the money, just be sure that it will run on your machine before you buy it."
5,"A different sci-fi movie,,,,","When I was taken by my friends to see this movie, I thought 'another boring american rambo type movie',,,however I honestly enjoyed it !!....I think the key of this movie is the argument, I mean you get immediately hooked when you think about 'reality'...what is reality anyway ??,,,this is what grabes you into the movie !!,,it is like reading the first book of Carlos Castaneda,,,you know the story is based on some kind of fiction, however the thesis, the idea, the core of the work is something else, and then if you add great special effects, action and some fine moments like the one in which she could confirm he was the one,,,then you end up with a new thing,,this is what's made this movie a huge success and I am sure it will mark a new 'style' to sci-fi movies."
1,The Best Movie I have Ever Seen,This was a horrible movie. It wasn't exciting until the last 30 minutes and even then I didn't jump off my seat. Most of the things I didn't even get. Making a trilogy out of the Matrix is a horrible idea.
3,Special Effects and then Nothing,Alright you have to admit. Great fight scenes. But beside that just plain weird. I know what u r saying see it again and u will understand but i have seen it three times and besides effects it is nuthin.
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"THe Matrix is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Keanu Reeves' acting is horrible, as well as the rest of the cast. The story has been repeated in over a hundred different movies, the whole ""machines have taken over the world"" thing. Most of the movie is mindless violence with flahy special affects. And how am I upposed to feel sympathy for Neo when the acting is so poor. I cannot believe the Matrix got such rave reviews."
5,This was the best actoin movie that will ever be made,The intencity of this movie is never ending. It is a great movie for any special effects buff.
5,The best science fiction movie yet !,No cheesy storyline or special effects here! This is science fiction of the next millenium! I love reading science fiction and this movie is as close as you can get to the movie you see in your mind when you read. Spectacular!
5,Perfect Movie,"This is what I would consider to be a perfect movie. Every scene well done and all fit together in a complete, perfect way. Anyone who hasn't seen this absolutely should. Fantastic movie."
4,A rather intriguing film with mind-bending special effects,"This film blew my mind. My first impression was an overly-hyped special-effects ridden, money-driven movie. What I got was an awesome tour-de-force of special effects action and one of the most engaging fighting sequences of all time. The writing is not the greatest, I agree, but it seems fitting at times for the film. I also thought that Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheus was a perfect cast (and they were going to cast Val Kilmer.) Carrie Ann Moss was awesome in her role along with whoever the actor was who played the head Agent. Overly-violent at times it still has some scenes that will stick with you for a long-time. The Matrix is one of those movies that'll have you questioning your reality at film's end. The Matrix is a gripping thriller with awe-inspiring special effects that is sure to become a cult classic and will be enjoyed for years to come."
5,Awesome Special effects!!,This was an awesome movie for sci-fi fans and for movie fans. The special effects were incredible. The story is somewhat confusing at first but hold on to the end and you'll really appreciate it. I have seen it 5 times already in the theater and I can't wait until it released for home use. I would highly recommend buying the widescreen version so that you don't miss any of the special effects!!!
5,What can I say: The best movie ever,Bought a DVD player just for this movie. I'll let you decide how excellent a movie I thought it was.
5,Great movie to see!,This is by far one of best movies that Keanu Reeves has ever made. I think that the special effects were great. I could watch this movie over and over and I believe that any other viewer would agree with me.
5,Spectacular Movie,"This is the best action movie I have ever seen, plus it's sci-fi. It has a tremondous plot line that's original. I was so dissapointed when the movie ended, because I wanted so much more. I can't wait for the sequel/prequel."
4,CHEESY BUT FUN,"Some of the moments in this film were so predictable and cliche that I could have wrote the script. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it & found it fun-- this despite the fact that notoriously bad actor Keanu Reeves is the main character. A plus is he doesn't maul his lines with a horrible quasi-British accent."
5,Amazing effects! A terrific sci-fi thriller!,"This was an absolutly amazing movie! I will admit, I've always liked movies that had a little sci-fi twist to them, so this movie was made for me. The special effects were incredible and the music was perfectly matched to the action. I liked the way that days after, I was still thinking about the concepts so well spun into the action. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has enjoyed futuristic movies that make you think."
3,OK but extremely over-rated!,"This is a fun sci-fi movie but not at all thought provoking. The film takes itself way too seriously. The alternate world/alternate reality theme simply doesn't remain consistent and consequently just doesn't work. But, if what you want to watch is a fun, silly, but kind of cool movie then watch this. But don't expect much more than that."
3,It's not bad,Pretty good. I waited until just now to watch these movies. It wasn't bad but I'm glad I didn't go to the movies and pay ticket prices for it.
4,"Matrix, scary idea","Despite the accent on the spectacular special effects, the plot involving a scary idea, that our reality is only a virtual reality program, is well planned with a nasty twist. Only when K. R's character uses his inherent ability to manipulate the program in real-time do the spectacular special effects serve their real purpose. Still, stopping bullets in mid-flight WOW! Sometimes oppresively dark, The clarity of the imagery and the crisp stop motion make this film a natural for the DVD transfer."
3,Cerebral and fast-paced.,"I'm not a big fan of The Matrix, but I can still respect it. I saw it for the first time when it was playing in the theaters a while back. After it had ended, I had known that it was pretty good, but I still felt like I had missed something. After just seeing it a second time on DVD, I can say that I understand it a lot better. I'm more of a fan of the first half than the second half of the movie though because the first half was more involving and thought-provoking in my opinion. The acting by all is good and the special effects are excellent. The Matrix is not a classic, but it no doubt is still quite cool. Worth a watch."
2,Not quite the classic they would have you believe,"Superb special effects. Intelligent plot-let down by sledghammer dialogue. Average to poor acting. Superb photography and camera work. The Matrix isn't quite the classic I had been lead to believe, it really is a mixed effort. Yet, compared to George Lucas' latest travesty/merchandising campain, it really is a good effort. Worst point: Casting of actor who played Damien in that moronic aussie soap Home & Away. He was bad in that and he's even worse in this."
1,thumbs down.,"i have to admit, when i saw the this movie the first time i was stunned by the great visual effects and the amazing martial arts. watching the movie a second time however, i realized how annoyingly pathetic the dialouge and plot is. it seems as if the writer just wrote a story to justify the special effects, not as if the visuals support the plot. there are huge gaps that are left unexplained and are just justified because ""this is the science-fiction and who knows what might be possible in the future"". and by the way, reeves is a terrible actor and it is very tiring to listen two his dull voice and ridiculous lines for 2 straight hours. this movie is terrible."
2,i VERY MUCH DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS,I did not understnad this movie. Please to be if someone explaing this to me.Lots of nonsense
2,Great idea!,"Fantastic idea..maybe even a little too close for comfort! But shame about the film, mediocre acting,very ordinary photography ( I was hoping for something on a par with bladerunner here )....a B movie with ingenious special effects....Edward Muybridge must be smiling to himself up there!"
4,"""No one can be told what the marix is."" (Morpheus.)","No one can be told what the matrix is. You just have to see it for yourself. I was very intrigued and amazed at how well THE MATRIX has turned out to be. I myself have seen the picture about three times. The special effect are so amazingly done that it puts STAR WARS THE PHANTOM MENACE to shame. The story is good and the acting is ok, although I believe Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus was brilliant. Despite the fact that Keanu Reeves is in good shape in this movie his acting ability is nowhere in sight which is kind of good for his caracter. Even though in just about every Keanu Reeves movie he looks dazed and confused I think this or his caracter he plays here in THE MATRIX suppose to look confused. Anyway THE MATRIX was a great movie and I defenitaly recomend this movie to everyone."
2,OK Maybe it was just me?,"OK Maybe it was just me, but I was REALLY confused when this movie ended. I guess maybe I was really tired but I don't understand?! Why was every flying around, going into the crappy world anyway?! I didn't understand it and it was not an intellectual movie either!! There were no long serious themes going on in this movie, nothing earth shattering. I think that it was an action flick, nothing more nothing less. Don't expect any more. It said nothing long lasting, and was in no way a classic, ok it had cool special effects but so did a lot of bad movies. OK, I am sorry to be the odd one out and say I didn't like it but I didn't! I don't think this one is worth it, maybe a rental. Make it a Blockbuster night :)"
5,The Best damn Movie EVER...,"I can't say it enough...This is with out a doubt the best movie that's ever been done. The Wachowski brothers sure knew what they did...It's a possible future, that the world starts over and the machines will take over the planet. I do rekomend it..."
2,The Matrix Hurah.,"I'm sorry, but this movie is dumb. When I went to watch the 1st time, I wasn't ammused. The story is easy to figure out (a greek philosipher came up with this theory along time ago) and the effects, well, they were to laugh at. They were the worst special effects I've seen. They look so fake. Even the film's highlight was unippressive. You could see a little black outline around the girl when she jumped up and paused in the air. I don't know why everyone thinks that so good. The reason it gets two stars is because it tried to be original, but sadly it's taken a story that has already been told and hollwoodized it. I'm not that easily ammused Hollywood. This film made Star Wars Episode 1 look great. ..."
1,Scratched disc.,The disc was scratched and wouldn't play for the second half of the movie. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,no choice,Am I the only one who wishes those jerks making movies would give us a choice between widescreen or fullscreen versions of these new movies?
3,movie 5 - DVD 0,"Beware of compatibility problems with your DVD player, and the special featurs of this movie. There are known issues with some older players being unable to properly play the special scenes."
1,It's A Matrix of Plot Holes!,"One of the characteristics of bad science fiction is the use of a fundamental premise that is unscientific. It is one thing to suspend physical laws (e.g., to ""allow"" faster-than-light travel to make a story) and another to be ignorant of them. I refer to the fact that humans do not produce any kind of energy; we, like all organisms, consume energy in endothermic processes. So, if one were connect a whole bunch of us together in a giant farm, one would get a net energy consumption and a whole bunch of fertilizer.I am only person I personally know who hated this movie, but the other people I personally know who saw it are children. There are many other things about the film that are unbearable, but I wouldn't expect anyone to want to read any more about it."
4,Pretty awesome special effects,sound is pretty good..... the commentary and special features are interesting....
4,Spaced-Out,"A Good,not Great movie! If you're into special effects This is for you! A somewhat amazing, if not Far-out movie for sci-fi buffs. It certainly keeps my friends attention, 2-3 times per week, a reel-buff! Buy-GEM"
3,An into to a great franchise,"What people say about this movie is really misleading. There is hardley any action in it untill the last half hour. But.....the last half hour is GREAT. I could watch it over and over and over again. I would of gave this movie 3 stars, but I realized this movie was just an intoduction to great franchise. I've seen the new trailor that came out around 4/11, and it was awsome. The next two Matrix's may be some of the best movies of the decade."
4,Too much compression,"The person who wrote the picture quality technical information on this disc must have watched it on a 19"" tv where you won't notice the horrible banding due to the digital compression. It's aweful in the dark regions, which is most of the film. Put all the extras on second disc and use less compression. Well, I still liked it and the sound is amazing in 5.1 surround. Just don't watch it on a tv bigger than 30 something inches. A progressive scan dvd player may help. I'll revise this if it does."
1,Very Disappointed ;-(,"I have never received the dvd. I have emailed amazon and DisCount Goodies; no response. If this is not resolved, I will discontinue using Amazon, and tell everyone I can of my bad experience."
5,Hip,"This is Morphius, and I want you to trust me, that when you see this movie, you will experience something you've never experienced before. If you take the blue pill, you will return to your bland ""Full House"" reruns. If you take the red pill, you will be taken on a journey that is this movie. Follow the white rabbitt, watch for the lady in the red dress, walk on walls and ceilings when dudes are trying to gun you down with a million bullets. Unless you do, you will never know if you are the ONE."
2,It wasn't as I good As I had hoped!,"I thought this movie would be alot better! Especially after readin all the reviews!! Acting wise, strong acting, I can give it that! Plot wise, it was terrible! This movie wasn't that great, even though it was better than some movies that I've seen, it beat my expectations, cause I don't expect anything from a movie, so my expectations are set very low, 1 star! The Matrix was better then one star! The special effects were good, but that doesn't make the movie, when will people learn that? That's all I have to say!"
4,It was great but whats the big deal,"I saw The Matrix and let me tell you it was a very good movie. A very good movie but not amazing. I loved this movie but I dont understant the people who bill it as the greatest movie ever. The movie has a very good, yet very complex plot that at times is hard to follow. Great action scenes and extreordinary acting make it a four star movie. The movie is about a young hacker who is told that the world he is living in is fake, created by machines. He is thrust into the real world and fightes for the humans. I highly reccomend it but please dont make such a big deal."
2,"Same old stuff, but with that normal Hollywood twist","I can't understand why everyone is so dedicated to this movie. I don't see anything so original about this very familiar story. I liked it the first time when it was called Star Wars, or Alice and Wonderland, or even THE BIBLE. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Laurence Fishburne, he was a bad mother; shut your mouth. The special effects don't really do it for me either. The idea of several cameras set up to capture a fluid action isn't a new one. This was the whole idea behind the advent of the motion picture camera, so just get over it people please. There are so many other quality pictures out there so just pick those up instead. THAT'S IT I'M DONE!"
3,The widescreen version of: The Matrix,"The movie is great, my problem is that with all the technology of today why don't they do like VHS movies and format the screen. Maybe some of you actually like it in widescreen. I don't. You should be able to buy a DVD movie in full screen version."
4,One of the best movies ever seen,"If you like sci-fri movies, you will definitely like this one. This has one of the best special effect I ever seen. But the kung fu portion is just slightly fake. Well I guess it is because none of the artor or artress is martial artist. Anyway this is a very good movies."
3,Not authentic,"While this book is fascinating as a means of seeing how dress was perceived, and as a primary resource (as the woodcuts are not modern), the costumer should keep in mind that these drawings are not always accurate, esp. regarding details. Many of the woodcuts have minor mistakes, some are gross misrepresentations of costumes Vecellio had no knowledge of. An interesting resource for the historian, but don't use this for costuming ideas unless you either don't care for accuracy or know enough to sift the false from the true."
4,Always trust Dover Books,"I had heard of the Vecellio book and had even seen excerpts from it here and there. As a member of the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism), with a persona in the Italian Renaissance, I was most anxious to see this book. It was all I expected! The first third of the book is Italian fashions from most ancient times to Vecellio's own period, which is the period of my persona. In no time at all, I'd found several costumes I want to recreate. The only drawback is the lack of color, but the drawings show considerable details."
4,Solid and has warmth to it. Occasionally heavy footed.,"Klemperer will never please the authentic purists, but he brings a solid dimension and a warmth of expression to whatever he does. As always, he is a power conductor (essential with Bach), which most ""authentic"" performers lack. That power style works very well in the opening ""Kyrie"" chorus, although it occasionally gets heavy-footed elsewhere. The other great selection is the transformation in the ""Confetior"" chorus, which changes to a very somber mood ""et expecto"" and then when the dead are raised to life, it is the most brilliant scene imaginable."
3,Stargram,"I've enjoyed reading this series....nice mysteries and interesting to go back in time for attitudes, dress, politics, etc. It was a quick read and enjoyable....a good time-passer. Using known authors as the detective is an interesting device."
2,If I hear that sneeze one more time!,"I was so looking foward to this Xbox360 version of the WSP, but I must sayI am disapointed, with the overall gameplay. The AI is a step up from the old xbox version but the game can be very tedious. Plus I have to play with the game background off due to the same old lame comments and background noises (sneeze ect)"
2,Worst Poker game,"I was looking forward to play poker on 360. Everything everybody has mentioned above is true. Also the game is so slow. They ""try"" to make it realistic timing but that failed. There are times when i'm pressing bet, bet or fold, fold but my player whats to take 5 more seconds to think about it before acting on my command.Horrible poker game."
5,Killing the total gym,"I've had this product for 3 years and this product is great for all fitness levels (except maybe bodybuilding) but for the average household it replaces an entire gym membership. I use this, and adjustable dumbells for a great full body work out. I'm 6'0 215 and pretty muscular and this works great for me. It's better than the total gym which is way more expensive and not as durable and also lacks these attachments (yes I had a total gym before my total trainer) . My only issue is for some excercises you may want to use additional weight and buy plates because if you are used to free weights the chest and back excercises will not be enough resistance. All in all it is a great home gym that will get any 1 in shape or keep you there."
3,not that creative,"it delivers a couple good ideas, the best ""creative"" idea that I might not of thought of was ""put a brighter watt light bulb in when showing the real estate because it makes the room look bigger"" and ""change the address numbers on the front of house""....other than that, the book only pointed out the obvious."
1,2nd year and holes everywhere,"I thought this pool was great the first year. took care of very well and took down in the fall to store. 2nd year I started to have leaks in the bottom and on the sides. So I took it down half way through the summer, and found over 25 slit holes, 20 of which were on the bottom. I patched them all up instead of buying a new one. Hopefully, since I refilled it, it will last through August. I will never buy another one again... The filter also went bad this year, and I had to buy a new one."
3,"to fast, and you cant fly it in a backyard.",battery takes 3 hours to charge. and lasts about 12-15 minuets. wing is very fragile. but when you crash it does not break( soft nose). the transmitter that comes with it is very bad. goes fast and you cant fly it in a back yard. you have to go to the park
5,excellent flyer,"This plane is really fun to fly although you need a bit of space (a football field is big enough) and definitely avoid wind. Wind makes the plane very difficult to control and my crashes have been caused by such. I've had 4 crashes which incurred damage and I've been up and flying again without replacing parts. I've repaired both elevons with Tuck Tape (a construction tape used in vapor barriers that is SUPER sticky and thin). I've snapped the tail spar in half (twice) and repaired it with a chopstick splint (twice), gluegun adhesive and Tuck Tape for wrap. The plane still flies great after each repair. I might replace the tail wing though as the tuck tape doesn't have enough resistance to return the elevons to neutral thus resulting in occasional circling behaviour.I also have a ParkZone Super Decathalon and I much prefer the Commander 2 as the prop and primary wing have suffered almost no damage after all my crashes. Rear Prop rules!"
3,Not particularly useful,"I've enjoyed other books by this author, but I didn't think this particular book had much to offer. The writing menu is a fun idea. Students choose from a variety of different, engaging prompts. I love that it features student choice, but I'm afraid the ideas are not worth the cost of the book. I would recommend instead purchasing Razzle Dazzle Writing."
5,A friendship tragedy,"I just want to cast my vote for the play: I love it. (I love the Knight's Tale, too). If you've ever known love to ruin a friendship, one of the other sex to come between you and your friend - doesn't this happen quite often? - this play is for you. I ached and wept. Besides it has Amazons. It's about friendship rather than love, it's a tragedy of friendship, and for portrayal of both woman-woman and man-man emotion, for the thesis that this love beats the ""sex dividual"" love, often, here's your play. It's late, dark but elegiac, at times staggeringly bitter, with a ghastly hymn to the Goddess of Love, and can be as gory a romp as Titus."
5,Speechless!!,There are litterally NO words to describe this book! It takes you on a whirlwind rollercoaster of emotions of trauma and self-disgust. I couldn't put it down for a second. 5 Stars doesn't quite say it!!! I reccomend this book to any and all Young Adults!!!Also reccomended:It happened to NancyGo Ask AliceWhen Dad Killed MomYou Dont Know MeMonsterSpeak
5,a great laymans manual,I liked this book very much. I felt it has much to offer in the way of practical advice for those going thru trying times in their life. I especially liked how Virginia quoted many different sources to illustrate her ideas. It's chapters are short and concise and is very easy to read and understand. I highly recommend this book.
3,Death By Simile,"I've always loved the movie, and now I'm finally reading the book. So far I like it, but the similes are dragging the story down. I've started to skip over sentences, in order to speed up the narrative. Where was the editor on this project? When I notice the writer's style more than the story, something is wrong.""I explore gingerly, trying to walk without crunching gravel, ready to leap into the underbrush like a shy animal. A two-car garage is built into the side of a hill, like a bear's den at the zoo"". Two simile-containing sentences back-to-back!? Scissors, please!I'm suffering from simile overload, and I'm only on page 70."
3,Was dissapointed,"Service was very slow book was a gift, good condition, except I had to take all the sticky stuffoff frm the back of book."
3,"Great book, poor reading.","The three stars isn't for the book itself...it's for the recording. It's either a poor transfer that has been mistakenly sped up, or the reader (Tom Parker) has a naturally nasal and high-pitched voice which isn't at all suited for this book. I lean toward it being a technical defect of this product, as Parker is an acclaimed and award-winning reader.The book itself, obviously, is fantastic. And if you're a big fan of it, this is still a very worthy addition to your audio collection."
4,Love this book,I have seen the movie many years ago and really enjoyed reading the book. It is a classic and i have suggested to friends.
4,"Julia at her best, wide eyed and innocent looking...",even though she played a hooker!! That always amazes me we love the character but hate what they do @ least in real life. Julia actually makes being a working woman look very appealing. Please no impressionable young women actually think you're going to meet a millionar hotty while standing in spikey heel boots on the street corner....too bad huh?
3,Director's Cut,I enjoyed this movie and patiently waited for the DVD to come out. I bought this DVD and realized there is a reason these scenes were cut from the movie. They should have stayed on the cutting room floor. I end up fast forwarding through the scenes. I would much rather have the letterbox format without the extra scenes added. Oh well. Hopefully Touchstone Pictures will get the hint.
1,What is the message?,"I am a big Gere fan but I wish that this movie would stay on the shelf! It gives young and naive people a totally wrong picture of what prostitution is. This movie really sets the cause of women behind about 150 years. Besides that, the dialogue is very weak and there's not much of a story."
4,Always fun to watch.....,"I just recently purchased the 10th Anniversary edition of Pretty Woman. Of course, I watched it the first night I had it home. Once again I was impressed by the charisma of Roberts and Gere. They are splendid together. Julia Roberts: a funny, vibrant actress. Her laugh is almost contageous. The scene when Gere snaps the top of the necklace holder on her hand is great. Gere: Smug, but likeable. They simply work well together. Other movies I would reccomend are, ""It Could Happen to You."" This is also very predictable, but a good movie. Also, ""The Story of Us"" is another good movie. Check them both out."
4,I still laugh everytime I watch it.,"Cinderella, Julia Roberts style! A really enjoyable movie that you won't admit to owning, but will watch at least once every six months. Julia plays the accidental prostitute destined to be swept away by rich (and only used a prostitute once in his life) corporate mogul Richard Gere. Every once in a while Hollywood casts a movie so perfectly that the chemistry creates wonderfully entertaining energy, this is one of those. It was done so well that they tried to re-create it with (the less successful) Runaway Bride. It is funny and really very endearing, truly charming. Julia (as usual) does a fantastic job and even Richard (an irritating snob) manages to carry his own weight."
1,A glorification of prostitution,"What could be more fun, romantic and glamorous than prostitution? Radiant Julia Roberts and handsome Richard Gere show us a world where streetwalkers are sweet, healthy, funny, charming, sassy and destined to live happily ever after. Yes, with Hollywood we expect to suspend disbelief, but this film shows no hint of the reality of sadness, brutality, desperation and boredom that define the lives of real prostitutes. Why do we need to make the world's oldest profession appear to be the world's most rewarding? Pretty Woman brings us a prostitute who never encounters pimps, drugs, disease or prison --- just fun, fun, fun ---- as her ""career choice"" earns her jewelry, designer clothes and eternal love. What a wonderful lesson for the kids. Disgusting."
2,Disappointing....,This was not the entire film. It was missing several scenes that were in the original release. I am somewhat disappointed.
3,"Not the best movie ever, but...","I've seen better movies before (like Planet of the Apes, for example) but this movie was pretty interesting. The movie has a great cast with strong characters. My personal favorite is Francine, Vivian's (Julia Roberts) street smart older sister whose dream in life is to be a ballerina. The musical numbers from the film are great, particularly the duet between Kit and Vivian."
5,"A funny, romantic tale that you'll always remember .","Richard Gere plays a rich, handsum buisness man named Edward that ends up asking for directions from a prostitute named Vivian. They go to the hotel together and end up falling maddly in love. At first, Vivian stayed because Edward paid her for buisness, but then she stayed because they couldn't get enough of each other. The entire movie is filled with a deep air and still gets in comedy that makes the movie complete. My favorite parts in the movie are when they first get in the hotel and wait for the elevator and when Vivian's friend Kit comes to the hotel to pick up a package and she talks to a costumer. I think that this is a film for anyone who's ever been in love."
5,A bit unrealistic... but who cares?,"With enough said about it being such a fairy tale, all I have to say is that it is still a great movie. Sure there's no such thing as a beautiful, clean, dignified hooker with a good-head on her shoulders, nor a rich businessman that respects hookers. But who cares? Quite simply it's a fun movie.I've probably watched Pretty Woman more than a million times over the years and still do not tire of it.Why I like it so much, you ask?Edward and Vivian have such a great chemistry between them. How can you resist?"
3,Why change what worked?,"The charming fantasy those of us enjoyed in the theatres has been unnecessarily cluttered with ""additional scenes"", and foul language that adds nothing to the movie, but an R rating. Why tamper with what worked? In my opinion, they should have left the original alone."
5,Sublime romantic comedey,"I thought that ""Pretty Woman"" was a fantastic movie about love. When two worlds come together unexpectidly and fall in love, when one of them has just fallin out of love. Neither of the two never really experienced true love. Edward Louis's dull, lonley world changes when Vivian Ward, a hooker, gives him directions to his hotel. One thing leeds to another, and he pays her $3000 to spend the week with him in his penthouse suite in Beverley Hills. To Vivian, this is a dream world come true. But it ends up being like home, as they fall in love. The both of them change worlds for each other, for the best. Edward is no longer a lonley, hard man anymore, and Vivian isn't a street walking hooker anymore. They help each other find love. I recomend this romantic comedey for anyone who likes to fall in love. The two perform amazinly together, its almost like a fairy tale."
2,ludicrous and not funny,"ludicrous and not funny. . .The leading characters are very attractive in looks, but the Cinderella story (with comedy scenes like Shaw's Pygmalion) is predictable and totally preposterous without being really entertaining.Not worth the trouble."
4,Entertaining,"Movie ratings are always very subjective, with one person's gem being another's trash. That said, I enjoyed the movie, despite it being a bit unrealistic. If your goal is just to be entertained you will likely enjoy this movie. If you are out to play movie critic you will find lots of problems. 4 stars"
1,Stop yanking our chains,"I purchased the 10th Anniversary Edition years ago. I still find it hard to watch with additional scenes. And, now that I have a 5.1 sound system, the absence of Dolby Digital 5.1 on the 10th AE is quite evident. If only the 15th Anniversary Special Edition offered the original theatrical version (very happy to see the 5.1), I would give into this marketing trap.Dear Hollywood, stop jerking us around. Be as creative as you want, just don't take away our enjoyable delusions of happy hookers."
2,Disappointed with product,"Product is not compatible with my nano. Can I still return it? I purchased it a few months ago. Over all, service and shipment was excellent. Would love to purchase a compatible lanyard."
5,It wasn't me!,Love this movie! Each time i see it i find something new i like about it! If you get it you won't be disappointing...I'm 21 and still love it!
5,DVD,Rocketman is a movie I have wanted my kids to see for a long time. It is not at any video stores anymore and was as cheap for me to just buy it. It was shipped promptly and was in good condition. Thank you.
4,Weird that Works Well,"Wolf's Rain is a good example of a show that succeeds when by all rights it should fail. There are so many weird and seemingly unrelated story elements at work here that it's a miracle the makers were able to create a story line that's compelling even when it's confusing.The cliffnotes: It's a post-apocalyptic werewolf story about wolves disguised as men who want a flower to lead them into paradise. It would be impossible for me to explain how the characters and themes make this bizarre plot work, so I'd recommend checking it out for yourself while you still have the opportunity. With Bandai going out of business, this DVD collection might soon be pretty hard to find."
3,"Great Series, Terrible Packaging","Wolf's Rain is one of the better series in anime. Lots of deeper meaning, beautiful animation...The only real problem I had with this boxed set was the flimsy plastic that held it together. I'm not sure how they fit a 7 disc set into it honestly. It arrived with a piece that held it together broken off inside. Also, the outer box had a crack in it. Besides Ebay, you can't beat getting this whole series for 35 dollars, but be aware of the possible poor condition it may come in."
3,MOOZ-LUM,This movie was one that I have watched twice already and will no doubt watch again. The cast was great and was one of the reasons I purchased this film. Interesting as well as informative content. I follow Evan Ross in his films and have not been disappointed yet. He's quite the rising young star and was excellent in this role. It is a good film.
4,Thought provoking film,"Very interesting and thought provoking film. While the overwhelming theme is centered around tolerance and being respectful of religion, there are numerous subthemes that make this a good discussion piece as well."
5,We love Breaking Bad,The price is good and having all the seasons on DVD allows us to watch it when we want to.
5,Great Show!,My husband and I recently bought both season 1 and 2 of Breaking Bad. This is a great show and we're so excited for season 3 to come out on DVD!
4,Definitely better than Season 1,The second season has a lot more going on than season 1 and isn't as boring. The Blu-Ray quality is still poor at best and doesn't look near as crisp as other Blu-Rays that I own. Hopefully season 3 will be better quality.
1,WARNING: REGION LOCKED!,"I live in Europe and I just spend more than $ 100 (including customs) on the Breaking Bad seasons 1, 2 and 3. Unfortunately I can't play them. However, this information is nowhere to be found. Not on Amazon, not on the box, not on the internet-database. The only way to find out is after spending a lot of money and putting the disc in the player. You get a screen which says to look on the box for more information. However, there is no information to be found anywhere. Supposedly Sony recently started to make their discs region locked without warning."
3,Breaking Bad Season 2,I did not veiw this CD. I is a gift for my son. I have no upinion of the film. Also I probably would not watch this program.
2,Region locked,I have watch this on tv so know thatthe content is good but...Amazon needs to be better about(start?) stating whether a disc is region locked or not. I buy dvds/bluray discs for viewing in USA and Europe. This one does not work in Europe.
1,Does not work on fabric,"The product description needs to be changed. I bought this glue specifically because the description says it works on fabric. This is not true. I tried gluing plastic to fabric and that did not work. I also tried gluing fabric to fabric. That also did not work. There was not even any adhesion between the pieces; they fell apart as if there were never any glue applied between them. The items I used were dry and I let them sit undisturbed for a day.The product works fine gluing paper to paper, and attaches them better than Elmer's."
3,avg. quality,"Karajan, Abbado, Bohm, and maybe Muti are better than this piece. This is, however, cheaper than others so you should get this one if you just want to have a Figaro. As long as you are ready to appreciate, it's not really a matter whoever you choose in Figaro. Unlike Don Giovanni, you won't get different impression from different piece in FIgaro except few irregular conductors. I personally think Giulini's Figaro is nothing special but much much much better than his terribly outdated Don Giovanni."
5,Terrific guide for family vacations,We have visited many of the facilities outlined in this book both before and after purchasing it. The reviews are very credible and the ideas are terrific. This really does focus on resorts where you can interact with your children. These people have really done their homework from Alaska to the East Coast and Hawaii based on our experience.
4,Love will never die,"Daniel Johnston is like a modern day outsider artist. He draws and plays music and seems to have a childlike view of the world. He writes love songs and bangs chords on the piano like there is no tomorrow. He creates most of the artwork for his records too. He use to record stuff on a boombox. These tapes circulated around and Johnston ended up influencing Kurt Cobain and then recording a record with The Butthole Surfers. He's been compared to people like Brain Wilson and Roky Erickson. Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse has recorded his songs in the past. Linkous and Johnston were destined to collaborate. The result seemed more layered and complex than some of those early bedroom tapes. ""Power of Love"" sounds like Foreigner on LSD. The song ""Mountain Top"" is a feel good song, meant for driving on the open road. ""You Hurt Me"" sounds like Biz Markee. Let love be forever or fear yourself. It's great."
1,not a romance,I bought the book thinking it was a romance when really it was a book of freindship with only one kiss on the very last page. There were also alot of things that were off in the book one being the main character was shot in the leg and shoulder however not but 10 days later shes on crutches and moving around fine. then there was the fact that she would go into terrible memories weather awake or dreaming and within seconds of coming out of it she would be joking with another character which made it hard for me to believe it was really that bad.Unfortunatley this book had far too many moments that just didnt fit for me and the lack of any romance just left me disappointed.I would not recommend this book to any one particularly if your looking for a romance.
1,This is all you need to know.,"IF you DIDN'T consider Puddle Of Mudd a generic, uninspired ""nu-rock"" band with their first release Come Clean, this record will change your mind about these grunge-era wannabes.If you DID hate them back then, like I did, this record will do nothing but make you hate them even more.That was pretty simple, wasn't it?Now go buy some Pearl Jam."
3,Puddle of mud returns,"well.....i've been waiting for this album for quite a while now! Maybe I expected to much from this album when compared to come clean.Its a good album but not great. To me it sounds average. Some songs stand out and are very good, then on the other hand some songs aren't that good.I hate to be negative. since I am a puddle of mud fan I will keep listening to it and maybe i'll begin to like it more. My honest opinion though, this album isn't as good as the first album--which is the case with a lot of bands today.Is it still worth buying? Yes. Any puddle of mud fan will like it, although I wouldn't try to compare it to the first one cause you'll be dissapointed. Take this album for what is and don't look back! Its an album that will grow on you though."
1,NIRVANA COPIES,"This albulm sucks. These guys need to realize they are not nirvana....u can really tell they want to be especially since they even dress like the band. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBULM. the lyrics are so horribly written and the singing is so bad, i couldnt stand to listen to the whole thing one time through. Overall, this is a stinking piece of crap that should of never hit the shelves"
2,i'm going to sleep now,"i will admit-i liked ""come clean"".the reminiscent vocals of kurt cobain ddrew me in from the start,and it was a good album.but ""life on display"" is just bad.the only song worth listening to is ""heel over head"" and even thats not too great.the vocals are stretched to painful boundaries, and its too bad we dont hear any decent riffs on this album.the drumming just kind of flows with the rest of the track, and hes not that talented anyway.if they stopped whining and actually made some decnet rock tracks, maybe wed have a good cd.avoid please."
1,Phony banal and awful,"This is phony and banal. The songwriting is decrepid and the music is completely unoriginal. These guys don't hold a candle next to nirvana. Nirvana's main strength was their songwriting and these guys are way far-off. I suggest skipping this atrocious attempt at music and go get ""In Utero""."
4,Decent 2nd album,"The Kansas City boys are back again after a little over 2 years off. Though not as strong as ""Life on Display"" it is still a pretty good CD and it has it's highpoints but a few low ones as well. It starts off the same as their first CD, strong, but starts to drift and die toward the last few songs. It lacks the classic song or two that their first album had and has a couple more songs that are mediocre at best. They sound more and more like ""Nirvana"" with every release but that's not all too bad but it does get them a lot of criticism.#1 - 9#2 - 8#3 - 8#4 - 8.5#5 - 9#6 - 8#7 - 8.5#8 - 7#9 - 5#10 - 7#11 - 6#12 - 6.5check out all my reviews"
1,4th Generation Recycled Grunge,"A brief lesson on recycled grunge. First you had the Brilliance of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains. Then came STP and Candlebox who were slightly derivative but great nonetheless. Starting to get ugly, bands like 7 Mary 3 and Creed were to follow and finally you have utter waste like Nickelback (""I like your pants around your feet..."" nuff said) and Puddle of Mudd. The faux-grunge is recycled every few years and with each new band it becomes more and more watered down. Not buying it? Look at lyrics alone. Read the lyrics of Nirvana (sheer poetry), Pearl Jam or even Candlebox. Now read the lyrics of ANY Puddle of Mudd album and compare. At least the first album had a couple of somewhat catchy tunes. What does Life on Display bring to the table? Nothing. I think it actually leaves a vaccume. Sorry guys you're a day late and a dollar short."
2,Could Have Been Much Better!!!,"I really wanted to like this album, I really did. I love ""Come Clean"" and I was in anticipation of this, but when I got it I couldn't believe how bland and uncreative it was. It sounds like it was thrown together in ten minutes. The only reason i give it two stars is for the songs ""Away From Me"" and ""Sydney"" that's it. The rest of this CD is awful. This band can do much better than this. I am, however still a fan, I just the hope the next album (If there ever is one) shows me a little more."
2,This is definitely not worth buying,"I happen to live in KS where these guys are from, and that might be one reason why I decided to buy this. I was familiar with their first album, but never bought it because I thought they sounded way too much like a rip off of Fuel and Nirvana (both very good bands). I purchased ""Life On Display"" because the single ""away from me"" although talentless, seemed to be stuck in my head. I was hoping the rest of the cd woud be good as well, but no it is the worst album I have ever heard and whats even more pathetic is they arent one of those bands that intentionally makes ""unorthodox"" music. The songs have no catch to them whatsoever, and the lyrics are worthless. Download the single ""away from me"" if you want, but dont even go anywhere near paying for the whole album, because you will end up pissed off that you actually gave these a**holes money."
4,Saved the day!,"We had a BBQ coming up and realized we needed to replace the heat plates in our gas grill, on short notice. After trying to find them locally with no success I got on Amazon and found them with no problem.These heat plates are heavy duty and should last quite a long time. Our only issue was the cost and packaging. Our BBQ takes 3 plates but they only come 2 to a package and are a bit pricey. We have 1 left so if we have to replace them again, have to spend the $$ to purchase another 2 pack."
5,Great movie and Great soundtrack..............,Dead Presidents tells the story of 3 childhood friends that are sent off to Vietnam right after graduating high school. What awaits them when they get home from the war sets the stage for this dramatic piece of art.Bokeem steals the show as Cleon. This is my movie!
2,I wanted to like this movie...,"mostly because I loved the soundtrack (volumes 1 and 2), but maybe the greatness of the soundtrack made me expect too much from this movie. Plus the soundtrack evoked some wonderful imagery that just wasn't in the movie at all. When the storyline veered over and became a cliche war movie, that's when the movie lost me. It was 1/3 war movie--I think all or nothing is key. It's the same as what the critics said--this movie tries to do too many things at once. CHaracter development was sacrificed."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though the plot doesn't always work, especially around the caper scenes, Dead Presidents is an effective and worthy look at what happens when men come back from war into a society that doesn't know quite what to do with them."
5,Great Picture being Re-Released!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"That's right, your eyes weren't fooling you: The very rare criterion collection version of Charade is being re-released! On the Criterion Collection website it says that it will be released in April and will be transferred to a new 16x9 format! I can't beleive this is happening! Ever since I saw the film I knew I needed the best DVD version of it but the Criterions had lost the rights to it and were forced to no longer sell it but here it is again. This is pure and utter joy for a film of this stature to be given the features it deserves. This is pure joy to my heart! Pure joy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent classic!,"This movie is one of my favorites. I describe it to people as being wonderfully Hitchcock, but it isn't actually by Hitchcock. It is the only movie that Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant ever made together, which is a shame, because they are amazing together. It's a murder mystery that takes place in Paris, and involves lots of plot twists and great dialogue. The picture quality is great- I definitely recommend this movie!"
4,Great Old Movie,My husband and I cuddled up on the couch and watched this movie. Don't know whos chemistry was better..Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn or My husbands and I :0) An Oddly romantic movie.
4,Well crafted star vehicle,The Criterion DVD is an EXCELLENT restoration. Well worth the money compared to the quality of other transfers. A witty script and great star chemistry from Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant.
5,A perfect romantic thriller...,"Grant, Hepburn, Donen, Mancini, Paris settings and Givenchy clothes...who could ask for anything more? This is one of my favorite movies -- and along with ""Pillow Talk"" is one I can watch over and over and over and never tire of. Cary Grant is all suave mystery, Audrey Hepburn is luminous and graceful as always, and the Mancini score adds to the fun. This film has it all -- suspense, romance, humor, action. If only they made a letterbox version!"
2,Not up to Cary Grant potential.,"Half hearten drama , romace weak with story line, and I like most Cary Grant movie but this is a one time see at best."
2,"Great Film, Bad Release","This film was great when I saw it on television... the greatest Hitchcock that Hitchcock never made. This version of it, though, is not the best copy. There are vertical black and white lines in several of the scenes, there are places in the film where it appears that the film was torn and patched together with pieces missing, and there are places where the audio seems messed up."
3,It's alright.,"Nothing groundbreaking in this film. Not really my usual genre-of-choice, so perhaps I'm a little bit biased. Oh, and FYI, it's in the public domain; you can legally download it for free elsewhere."
3,Hard to feel any sympathy,"As a fellow autoworker, I thought I'd read this to get some of the funny stories he no doubt had. Instead we get a whiney tale about how trapped he is in his job. THe complaints he has are amazing considering how little he was actually at work due to layoffs and medical leaves. Although there are some comical moments and as a whole it is well written, the guy represents that stereotype that helped bring the companies down. Wow, drinking on the job not to mention being so far gone and then DRIVING HOME! Sorry, I know exactly how it was for you and you're a bad representative, so glad you could be published."
5,Perspective,"Accurate, interesting and all around great read! I can't put the book down! Hamper did fry all his brain cells."
1,Slow getting started...should have ended sooner!!!,This film didn't stimulate any thought at all. Dull from the beginning to the end. This is the first Swedish film I've seen and will probably be the last.
4,Morality and the Good Life,"The book was just as advertised, though it had some highlighting, which was not mentioned. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase."
2,"Good, but missing important parts","In ""A View to a Kill,"" Barry is in fine form, including many instances of the exciting themes we associate with 007 movies. To me, the highlight of the movie was tracks where Barry mixes traditional Bond thematic elements with tunes based upon the Duran Duran theme (such as the Wine with Stacy cut). However, the album to me and others is rather disappointing, as it is missing important parts of the score. Others have mentioned Bond's arrival at Zorin's estate, Stacey's arrvial, the Fanfare, and Bond dangling from the Zorin Airship. Personally, I was looking for the music from the State Office Building rooftop scene is my favorite cut from the movie, the main reason I bought the album, but that is also missing from the Soundtrack CD. I imagine if Capitol Records ever comes out with a more complete soundtrack album from this movie, there'd be a high demand for it from fans like myself, but don't hold your breath."
5,Neuritis-a valuable updated information source,"Excellent book, full of up to date information on every thing a patient needs to know about their condition. Well researched and user friendly."
1,Black fuzz,This is fine as long as you don't plan to wipe sweat from your face with it. The wristband leaves black fuzz wherever it goes. Not the best.
1,It's Only Half a Loaf,"The black cartridges are fine, but the color ones seem to have been made for another printer. Essentially, only 50-percent of my order was filled."
4,BCI-24 cartridge ink,These ink cartridges work and fit right on my old Canon i475D printer and are as good in print quality as the original ones. Very economical price too. I will purchase them again when needed.
5,so far so good,"I got my cartridges very quickly. So far I've used the first black and color cartridge. They seem to work great... ink was dark and clear, color was vibrant. I have only printed a few things, so I'm not sure how long each cartridge will last, but for the price, I can't complain."
1,Terrible,Short & Sweet.....all six cartridges were dried up the day I received them! Not one was any good! Factory originals for me from now on!
1,Quigley distanced himself from Skousen,"In response to those trying to link Skousen to Carrol Quigely, do a little research. Like much of Skousen's work, ""The Naked Capitalist"" is really just a collection of half-formed ideas, personal biases and fear. The scholarhip of the book is shaky at best and the one scholar, Georgetown University historian Carroll Quigley, who Skousen claimed endorsed Skousen's ideas in the book, did everything he could to distance himself from Skousen.[...] to the 1971 issue of the journal Dialogue, where Quigely denounces Skousen's ideas and calls him dishonest.""Skousen's personal position,"" Quigley wrote, ""seems to me perilously close to the 'exclusive uniformity' which I see in Nazism and in the Radical Right in this country. In fact, his position has echoes of the original Nazi 25-point plan."""
4,Chinese Checkers,The board is very sturdy and marbles are nicely colored. The marbles do roll off the board when knocked so it does not work well for clumbsy fingers.
5,a must buy!,"I was a little hesitant about getting this DVD. I didn't want to invest more money on getting another crappy video. The ones I got before was a BIG BIG disappointment, A DISASTER! They promise you so much and you experience nothing but disappointment. I wanted to make sure that every penny I spent on any DVD's would be worth enough. This DVD goes way beyond expectations. It's excellent and the instructors are totally mind blowing. Everything worked out just perfectly and now I'm eagerly waiting for my 2nd volume. Many of us don't actually believe in feedbacks coz we have different views and interest...its better you get one for yourself and watch it. As the saying goes' SEEING IS BELEIVING' I can only recommend it."
4,Salsa Crazy DVDs,My boyfriend thinks he's God's gift to Salsa. He won't admit it but I know he learned a thing or two while I was practicing.
2,Weak,Very disappointed......my family gave it four thumbs down. Disney at its worst...nothing else to say really....bad is just bad .thanks.
5,All grown up and showing their roots!,"I bought the new Blink expecting to hear the same silly songs I was used to from their previous releases. Not only did I get what I was hoping for; but I also got an impressive array of experamentation with unique technics of instramental sounds, and lyrics that simply blew me away. Totally worth the wait!"
5,blink 182- the best band out there!,"blink's new cd, is so good, its one of those cds that you listen to, and it just makes you smile! so go out and buy it!!"
2,Listen to the old Blink 182,"There's only TWO good songs: Feeling This and Obvious. The early albums like Dude Ranch involved Blink 182's music classified as less EMO. Blink 182 used to be punk rock, now what happened to them? They turned pop and not punk. That is what you get if MTV owns your music, and the early 90s would be the best years of your life if you cared about when music didn't suck."
2,not what i expected,"i have been a blink fan since buddah, i have grown up with songs such as Carosel and The Girl Next Door, over time i saw them grow as a band, and up till take off your pants and jacket i was fine with that... songs like dammit, whats my age again... man overboard gimme one good reason... they were all great... but on this new album, i can only find one song that relates to their past... this song is Go... which is a pretty good song... guys i beg u look back at where u came from... and think about what got u here... next time u write a song... write it because u want 2 not cause u have too... dont play to the crowds... play for yourslef... peace..."
3,When Baby boys grow up,"I have to admit that their songs are much different from past CD's. I much darker version of Blink 182. But one thing hasn't changed. Songs about girls and love. The theme is reoccuring and gets very old. Why do they have to keep singing about girls and love when their all married and have children? They need more humrous songs or songs about partying. I miss they cynical boys with creative lyrics. The music is good, but are easily forgetable. Blink 182 should split up and just stop. I reccomend Box Car Racer."
2,"Um, well this is their best.","I frankly just don't like them, and don't know why I'm even writing this review. If Alternative Pop-Rock is your thing, then check em out, but if you're looking for punk, then try Rancid, Minor Threat, Propagandhi, Pennywise, and Bad Religion."
5,Wow it's so totally 'obvious'!!,I bought this CD like many others not knowing wat to expect. I first heard Feeling this and thought it was abit different. but after id listened to it a few times it became a great song. I have listened to full album and think its totally amazing. i didnt really think the fallen interlude was good but the rest of the album makes up for it. whther u r a blink 182 fan or not BUY THIS ALBUM
