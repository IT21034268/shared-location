3,At least there are a lot of them,"Techno is so unreal, and there are a lot of tracks. With 50 tracks, you are sure to find one you like. Take a stab at it. Its only a hundred and twenty five dollars. Its a great deal."
1,Doesn't work well,"This product doesn't work well. The bipod legs springs out like it's supposed to but in order to put the legs back into the Weaver Grip, you really need to bang it hard for it to stay in. If not, it just keeps on springing out.I bought this item to play paintball and when you're in the middle of a firefight, it's really hard to focus on the game when you're trying to fight with your bipod legs.I've wrote to the seller and he knew about this issue. All he could propose as a solution is to try to bang it in harder. Wtf?Dont get me wrong, the price is good but you're paying for a defective product so in the end, it's not as a good deal."
3,Decent,Worked great out of the box. It is very very loud. So if you plan on being stealthy with this you have to leave the bipod out. After releasing the bipod a couple times it quit releasing itself with button. I now have to pull the bipod out. Works great as a grip. Very sturdy. So in conclusion bad bipod great grip. I purchased for bipod not grip.
5,good enough for real SKS,"this foregrip bipod is tough enough for my fully moded russian SKS, the bipod is for resting and steading your rifle not to you to sit on or jump on it, and for this purpose it is perfect. so dont waste you money on an expensive one get this and you will be much happier and richer. I LOVE THE SMELL OF GUN POWDER IN THE MORNING!!!!!"
3,Took too long to get,"The product is very durable and well constructed but...... it took them forever to send it to me i had to go as far as emailing them about it, asking where it is then a couple of days after i emailed them i got my grip. i give it 3 stars because of the bad customer service in conclusion the product is great the service is crap."
4,"It's not the best, but it's good for the price.","It's easy to use, reliable, and FUN!Pro's:Instant grip-to-bipodFunEasy to useCon's:PlasticHard to push bipod back inDifficult to put on gunBut it's a very nice product and I use it all the time."
5,Great Product!,The item is not what I expected...Its better!!! The review for this item was incorrect. The build feels very solid. Played around a few times with the spring and it feels sturdy. Also fits perfect with my AR15. The shipping was fast also. I am very pleased and I would definitely buy this product and use this seller again.
2,No comparison to the real deal,"Bought this to hold me over until I get an actual Grip-Pod. I snagged one on eBay, so here are the differences:the 3Skull:-is the exact same dimension, but slightly lighter-is made from different plastic. Both feel very sturdy, but I wouldn't trust the 3Skull as much.-pops out as well as the grip-pod, but has more play/movement in the legs.-does not close as easily as the grip-pod, the legs really need to be slammed back up into the grip.-does not feel as sturdy. I expect it will break eventually, though I am happy with it for the price.The GPS Grip-Pod has steel reinforced legs and more sturdy mounting hardware."
5,good stuff,"Product arrived on time and in excellent condition. The 'gripod' is pretty well built, and if you aren't careful with opening the legs you could hurt yourself they are so strong! very pleased with this product"
5,Good Bi-pod,This is a sturdy item works well for paintball. Legs are high strength plastic so I wouldn't take this to Iraq but to the paintball feild... all day long.
5,tea,"If you like a strong but not bitter tea, Assam is the tea for you. For years I bought it in the UK, but I'm unable to travel anymore, so thank goodness for Amazon. I just wish I didn't have to buy so much, but what I did was to share some extra boxes with family and friends."
2,NOT for 20GB iPod,-1. This product is for the thicker 40GB iPod photos. My new 20GB iPOd thicknedd doubled after I used the case ! Now it doesn't look so cool nor doe it fit my pocket.-2 Gets dirty easily on the White color as its textured rubber.-3 Can't use the iPod with my iTrip FM tranmitter or the DOCK because of the thick casing !!!What good is this product ??? This is only for those who really abuse their iPods becasue the case sure is very sturdy
1,my ipod screen CRACKED in this CASE!,I would never recommend this case to anyone! I bought it to protect my ipod screen after hearing so many horror stories on ipod screens breaking easily. I think the case could have even been the cause of the crack because of the pressure inside. I'm not sure what happened but it didn't protect my brand new ipod at all. The only good thing about it is that it's really cute.
4,Get the black case instead,"While I agree with other reviewers that this case is ultra-cool, I have a suggestion for anyone considering buying it: Get the black case, not the white. After only a few days, the edges of my white case were filthy. Even if I regularly clean it with soap and water (which is a drag), the rubber is starting to yellow--as white plastics are apt to do. Otherwise, this product is well-designed, highly functional and totally recommended."
3,Seems practical,"This book I have had the pleasure of reading. It seems practical, if you live a practical life. Its very nutritional an suggest guidelines for reaching and maintaining an active life. It gives you real hope if your not an active person and had been wondering about how to get started. The recipes are very simple to follow (if you like to cook which I dont). Even though I'm not going on this particular diet because of my hectic lifestyle, (and I don't have time to think about preparing meals) I would recommend this book because it will really work. I've been on a plan like this one in the past, its just now there are so many fads out that you can't find good weight reduction books like this anymore."
1,This machine is dangerous,I can not believe that this machine has not been recalled. It only pops about 1/2 of the kernals you place into the machine and spits about a dozen sizzling hot kernals around the kitchen (in addition to popcorn) while you attempt to get a bowl full. My prior air popper was great - never had a problem. This machine is a hazard - I had to have my kids leave the room because I was afraid they would get burned and I continued to find kernals around the kitchen for two days following. It's a hunk of junk.
2,Piece of Junk,"I'm only giving it 2 stars (as opposed to 1) because you can indeed do a little finagling to get it to work. But when you buy a new machine, you shouldn't have to do all these tricks to get it to work right. Glad I didn't throw out my 30-something yea- old Wear-Ever Popcorn Pumper before I tried this one out. The lid on that one is cracked and and taped back together, the metal insert for melting butter is long missing, but it is still a much better machine and the one we now continue to use."
1,"Avoid, not worth it!!","I also purchased one of these, big mistake. Poor design. Popcorn flying everywhere, unpopped kernels flying out, makes a huge mess. I got this item really cheap, and it is still not worth it. Junk."
5,Space Pen Refills!!!!,"The Fisher Space Pen refills fit these terrific pens, too! (That should be a universal design requirement!)I've had the titanium one (older), for years --- still a favorite!"
2,Not worth it!,"This cd would like you to believe that it contains the biggest club trance songs of the year 2000. However, this is mostly bland stuff with a few well-known names scattered throughout. True artists like Paul Van Dyk and Mauro Picotto are included to draw attention away from the fact that a majority of these tracks are by the same faceless producers under a number of different names. Don't waste your money on this weak collection. Pick up Van Dyk's Out There and Back or one of the Global Underground collections instead. This is NOT the best of trance!!"
5,Very insightful,Love this book. I am excited to go to some of the places described. Has a lot of information about each cemetery.
2,Do yourself a favor! Spend more!,"At first this 2 disc Russian live production(should be complete on one disc.)seems like a bargain. The snag is in the sound with it's less than ideal dry acoustics. The big moments do not effectively impact the home listener, probably conveying a less exciting experience than what the audience got the day of the performance. Furthermore with the exception of a few numbers, most lacking the inventiveness of Prokofiev's masterpieces, makes this work bland. You and your collection will be better off with the composer's suite of highlights, or just spend more on one of the premium versions."
3,Independent Producer,"This book is an excellent book for producers ONLY. If you are a director, animator, designer, etc. then this book is not for you at all. For example ,it doesn't mention the aspects of lighting, camera movements, artistic style and the list go on.Adding to that, the authors seems to have low knowledge of 3D graphic and animation software and hardware. The authors didn't mention and software package at all. Both of the authors seems old in the animation industry, and ,unfortunately, they didn't improve their knowledge to match the new era of 3D animation.Why three stars then? As I said, if you are producer, this book for you, but still not enough source. Also, if you are a planing in investing in animation business and don't want to go into the details of producing animation, this book is a good source for that purpose."
2,Message to the author,"Both industry experienced ladies have done a good draftingof the content. It looks more theoretical and fails to explain the practical aspects. I work in animation industry, butit doesn't mean that I have to undervalue artists.In a animation production both creative and management teamplay equal role. But here the artists have been undervalued a lot.it doesn't cover core production management aspects. Wholeproduction process has been explained in mechanical procedure.The animation production company is not a product manufacturingcompany."
2,Too much Mary Sue for my tastes,"I've enjoyed a couple of this author's books and just couldn't get into this one as much. The main character, Gillie, just had too much Mary Sue going on, from her purple eyes (which is like 100 automatic points on the litmus test) to having unusual talents that save the day! She lands her man, saves some kid, has her own portable Yoda, and nails the bad guy as the Bad Guy (tm) before anyone else does. It's a pity because Mack was a lot of fun."
4,good stuff,The overgrip is great. I am really happy with it. There is no problem with it. I use it well.
4,Inspirational!,"""Della Raye"" is the true life, depression era story of Della Raye Rogers, who was wrongly committed to the Partlow State Asylum in Tuscaloosa, Alabama at the age of four. Author Penley does a first-class job of detailing the horrors that she endured, and tells her uplifting story in a lively, engaging style. It is obvious that Penley did extensive research about the Partlow Asylum, the ""science"" of mental health in the early part of the 20th century, and spent many hours with Della Raye herself. Della Raye's own words are scattered throughout the book and are a great complement to the images he creates.Della Raye's story is one of those that makes each one of us wonder whether we would have the personal strength, intelligence, wit, grace, and grit to not only endure the unspeakable, but shed the bitterness and go on with our lives. This is a fine book."
1,Not sealed with tamper proof safety seal on cap,"I ordered this iodine on Jan. 15, 2012. Received on Jan. 28, 2012.Mailed via post office in brown resealable envelope with NOTamper proof safety seal on cap of bottle. Just sitting in envelopethat can be opened and resealed lots of timesall by its unsealed self - no packaging or invoiceor anything. Botheration.All bottles of iodine I have purchased in storesor online have had this plastic safety seal onthe cap. Except this one from Brooklyn, New York.!I therefore will not use this iodine on my biopsywound or anything else as I wish to err on theside of caution. Debating whether to throw it outor go to the trouble while sick of returning it."
5,A new poet to watch!,"This is an excellent first book of poetry from stephens. The work is almost apocalyptic in its haunting exploration of human relationships and the impossibility of reaching out for another's touch. A must-read for those interested in the cutting edge of today's literature. As the reviewer notes on the back cover of the book: ""nathalie stephens' poetry vibrates with beauty and a dangerous, delicious, cut-glass tension. Because it tells the truth, many people will find this book discomforting or even threatening. Good. I'm all for stopping gentle readers cold in their tracks."" --RM Vaughn."
1,Horrible.,"Let me just say, here and now, that I never made it passed the first chapter. Secondly, let me say that I then gave the book to the goodwill. I NEVER (seriously never) give my books away. I always buy and keep them because I am one of those oddballs that likes to reread books.It was so sad to have to break this habit. Please save your money and buy a better book. ANY book. Please. Seriously."
2,Waste of time and money,"Just like everyone else, I want atleast 4 seasons to come out a year, I will agree Simpsons Christmas 1 and 2 were great and so was the Simpsons Halloween. But these are just stupid. I mean if your going to make the single dvds atleast make more of the Simpsons Tree house of Horror dvds, they are way behind."
1,RELEASE THE SEASONS FASTER!!!,"WARNING: READ THIS REVIEW SL O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O WLY! Emphasize on the words in CAPS LOCK.We Simpsons fans want the SEASONS. Not the RANDOM PICK EPISODES on single disc DVDs. We want regular SQUARE boxes that have the SEASONS. Keep releasing them ALL; you still have NINE SEASONS to release (8-16). Stop releasing the RANDOM EPISODES. We want S E A S O N S ! SEASONS 1-5 are great, Fox (thank you). Please release the SEASONS faster.Jonathan WinchellP.S. Release the SEASONS >>>FASTER<<< and >>>COMPLETELY<<< STOP THE RANDOM EPISODES DVDs."
5,A figurative light bulb to generate a desire in a child to be an inventor,"I first read this book when I was in early elementary school and the effect was so strong that for years I fantasized that I was an inventor like Edison with my own research laboratory. Edison was one of the most fascinating men, his inventive genius was second to none and there was never a man more driven than he was.Edison was largely uneducated; he was pulled out of school when his teacher grew angry over his constant asking of questions. Many people doubted his abilities, yet the combination of intense drive and extreme innate intelligence makes his story an inspiration that will live as long as his inventions do. Which will be as long as humans maintain a society based on technology."
1,Do not buy!,"I bought this because it was $20 at the time. It makes the worst waffles you can imagine! The waffles are more cooked in the middle and the sides are light light brown. Its also VERY hard to clean. Waffles leave oil behind, and you need soap and water to clean that properly. Since the plates don't come out its impossible to get all the grease which makes the next batch of waffles taste bad. Also, you're never quite sure how much batter to add, if you add too little the waffles come out thin in some spots. And when you add how much the instructions tell you to the batter leaks out all over the side of the iron which is also a MAJOR pain to clean.This is why I just bought the Black and Decker Iron with removable plates. It cost more but, breakfast will be so much easier."
2,jute?,"This is very sticky and color is stylish, but some crumbles from jute and green plastic (""meshing jute fibers with patented PER plastic"")make my black yoga pants look messy. Not much natural feel from jute, but more plastic feel and smell. Disappointed."
1,"Don't buy it without reading this review, Be informed","Actually 1 star is 1 too many, but they don't allow 0. I threw mine away after watching it the first time. I bought it for my son for his birthday. Wrong! Definately not for kids, not even for adults. Try perverted adults. First, we have ""Luke""'s Aunt commenting on how he has grown up. (Did I detect an incestuous tone in her voice? Surely not, so keep watching.) Then we see ""Obi-wan"" and ""Luke"" looking up ""Princess Lea""'s dress. ""Obi-wan"" and ""Yoda"" telling ""Luke"" to touch his tongue to theirs, and a homosexual relationship between the two droids. This one goes straight into the trash. If you like this sort of thing....Go for it. As for me and my house, I DON'T THINK SO!"
2,POOR PORDUCT,"I'M SORRY I BOUGHT THIS BRAUN TOOTHBRUSH, THE BATTERY DOES NOT HOLD THE CHARGE LIKE THE OLD ONE I HAD"
4,"was a replacement, no surprise. good brush for low price",I had the same brush before and I liked it. But it died after 4 years of daily use.So I decided to by the exactly same one again. In addition I bought the 8850 from Braun.I must say the 8850 is better. However this one is a very good brush and far cheaper than the 8850
1,terrible quality,It is not the real album. It is very terrible quality. I can barely recognize the any of the songs.
5,"looking for where to start on positive parenting, this is it","although not for very young children, I find this book to be an excellent starting point for all these parents who want the best for their children and who want peace at home, raising their children compassionately, respectfully without spanking or time-outs. This is it and without the laxism sometimes found in non-punitive parenting tips one sometimes find in some parenting groups.It is easy to read, funny and full of nice tips."
1,Bad Deal,"This seller advertised the wrong product...then charged half the amount of the product to ship, again to return and again to receive. So...just threw it away...was cheaper."
1,horrid recording!,"I was unfortunate enough to buy this CD a local store. It's a hideously recorded version of Giselle. Basically, they put a microphone in front of the orchestra - and not a very good microphone at that.Just listen to one of the audio samples here on Amazon, and you may think the audio is bad because of your internet connection -but no! That's actually as bad as the audio CD sounds!For the technical-minded among you - there are phasing problems, flanging, almost no bass presence, and well, it's just the most poorly recorded audio CD I've ever heard.I am no audiophile snob, either, folks. But when I put it in the CD player I thought something was wrong with my system.Save your money!"
5,"Sound is not that bad, performance is exceptional.","I have to disagree with the previous reviewer. Maybe you need to switch players. Ok, I have to say the sound, taken from a live recording, is not as crystal clear as a studio recording, but certainly more than acceptable even by today's standard. This one is certainly one of the good renditions of the ballet. The tempo is fast where it needs to be and slow where it is appropriate. The orchestra is simply wonderful. The Bolshoi is exactly at home in this repertory. 4.5 stars for sound, 6 stars for performance."
1,Sound is awful,"I have to agree with the reviewer who said the sound is bad. It is TERRIBLE! It sounds as though it were recorded under a blanket on my kid's Fisher-Price cassette recorder, and the tape then put through the wash. It is the worst sounding commercial recording I have ever heard. A Dead-Head on acid recording from the lobby could have done a better job. Avoid this like the plague!"
3,Horrible Sound great performance!,I could imagine that if I were in the theatre I would have absolutely felt the power of the orchestra. But because I'm not at the theatre and was actually expecting a great recording....this was kind of dissapointing! The CD is an analog recording from 1975 (SO BUYER BEWARE!) This is AN ORIGINAL 1975 Recording. So if you're looking for a CD quality recording of this ballet...THIS CD IS NOT IT!
3,Not a bad second book,It is never good to draw from just one sourse. This was a good second sourse for info on autobody.
4,Good manual,This is a good book of instructions for the DIY who has a talent for doing automobile repairs. The book is quite informative and helpful.
2,Don't buy based on appearance or claim of Aluminum,The product description and picture are inaccurate. I received a basic PLASTIC fan - though the model number does match that shown.I went ahead and installed it cause I don't have time for returns and all that jazz. It blows air like it's supposed to.
2,Boring...I learned nothing.,Boring...I learned nothing. Just hack session licks. No spirit. No soul. It'd be great for a guy in a cover band that knows nothing about country and needed to learn something quick.
3,Maybe !,"It seemed like gratuitus sexual stuff, I mean maybe I just didn't get it (and still don't) ..sex and entertainment didn't seem to match up real good, but the chicks were hot enough. I think it could grow on you if you watched it over and over."
5,Humorous and intriguing tales of real medical experiences,"Rob Myers' Woman Who Swallowed A Toothbrush And Other Bizarre Medical Cases presents over fifty humorous and intriguing tales of real medical experiences. From a life threatening body painting experience to a thyroid problem which causes a literal eye-popping experience in the ER, this is packed with intriguing situations."
5,"A poetic, but yet very informative book on a classic Tarot deck.....","I have both the companion books for the Hanson-Roberts (the other one being Tarot Unveiled: The Method to Its Magic by Laura A. Clarson) and this is by far the best one.I am not sure why the other reviewers disliked this book so much...I found it very insightful, full of information and hidden magic. She describes the cards in a poetic way, perhaps bringing to your attention things you have missed. Also she has a wonderful chapter in there about the artist. More info at least than I have been able to learn anywhere else!If you love the Hanson-Roberts Tarot than this book is a must have in my opinion. You will get much from it and her writing is is inspired and informative."
2,High Dollar,The DVD has only 1 song for you to learn. Cost of DVD is to high for only 1 song. This should be a $2.00 DVD and/or maybe not that much. The other tips were more or less just basic guitar teaching.
1,The worst SONY product ever,"I bought this Sony DRX-500ULX in order to record my videos from a digital camera, also SONY, connected to a SONY VAIO, and in just a few words DON'T BUY THIS, it needs 20 GB of space in hard disk and if you burn a dvd probably you can't play it in your home dvd."
2,The price keeps going up and up.,Microsoft keeps charging more and more money to let you develop for their operating system. This makes it harder and harder for small developers to be able to deploy applications on their OS. This will eventually lead to their downfall as the lead operating system.
4,"Good jackie chan movie, not as funny as Rush Hour though","I loved Jackie Chan in Rush Hour. He was pretty funny in that movie. I always seen Jackie in Kung Fu type movies, and this one of course he's a Spy, close enough. But, he acts as a babysitter for the next door neighbor who he is dating. Anyways, if you've seen The Pacifier with Vin Diesel and liked it, you will enjoy this movie. Like one other reviewer said, I have to totally agree with. I think they even have the same number of kids and the mom is the same person. But anyways, if you liked that movie you will enjoy this movie, almost exactly the same, even have funny pets."
1,"One to say, ""Pass""","If you don't have any other venue by which to insult your intelligence, by all means watch this. The kids are beyond bratty and disrespectful which is a direct result of their lack of parenting. We were looking for light entertainment. This failed again. This is a failure all the way around. We got through about 20 minutes and turned it off. When you're looking for a movie for the family, pass on this one."
2,"Information does not cover latest release,CD contains old SW",I have worked with Checkpoint FW since version 2.x release and I would consider this book basic at best. It does not cover any of the new features in the current version 4.x and the information on the accompanying CD contains info/whitepapers on version 3.x. Therefore if you do not know anything about CKP FW this one is ok; but if you are looking for latest information this is not money's worth. You would be better to get a demo licensed version from CKP.
2,Piece o' garbage,"Waste of time for technical people. If you're a manager or exec and need to understand what your IT people are doing, it's allright, but in terms of the actual content, it's pretty sad.Just to show I'm not whining needlessly:1.) No information on how FW1 handles routing/routing changes, other than how to block them2.) Every 2-3 pages there's at least a 1/2 page that's pure marketing stuff; Talks about the benefits of Checkpoint, how it stacks up against the competition, etc. Some of this stuff in neccesary to understand how the app works, but the author went off the handle3.) IncompleteThe book goes in-depth for UNIX installs, but barely touches NT or HP platformsSave your money. Log into checkpoint.com and read their whitepapers; you'll get 90% of what's in the book for free."
5,"Great recorder, just read the book","I am an auctioneer and purchased the WS-310M and ME-15 Mic to record the entire auction, from beginning to end. After reading the book, familiarizing myself with the product, it worked flawlessly the first time I used it. During my break, I pushed ""Rec"" again which pauses the recording, and after the break pushed ""Rec"" again. The recording continued without making a separate file. It did a fantastic job of not only recording myself, but you could hear people asking questions, etc. from the back of the yard. Copying the files to my laptop was quick and painless. I strongly recommend this product."
1,"Good Quality Recording,Not Good Quality Craftsmenship","I bought this to put down song ideas,it has good clarity and digital sound.After a bout a year it started telling me the battery was dead when i knew it was a new battery.Well i paid over $200 for the unit at radio shack.The real downer was when it started not going back together as it comes apart so you can plug into your pc.Its not made very good at all.Now it won't even click back into position..i have to hold it with a rubber band.You'd think for over $200 you would get a quality unit,just not the case with this.I will think twice before buying Olympus ever again."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Joyce Chen does not make Seafood Scissors. It has not made Seafood Scissors for several years. To verify: Simply contact the Joyce Chen Corporation itself. I was sold these seller-described ""Seafood Scissors""... and when the package arrived... I received the red Joyce Chen Original Unlimited Scissors instead. I was told, and I quote: ""Yes, these scissors are one in the same and are advertised differently for broader appeal."" Still, it took well over one month for an excellent, hard-working, and ethical Amazon representative employing earnest diligence to right this situation and get my money back. A word to the wise: Always read the exact product branding description and check to see if you are receiving exactly what products are described."
5,The Only Book You Need,"I am the proud Mom of a 5-month-old baby girl. When we first brought her home from the hospital, we, like most new parents, had so many unanswered questions and turned to the ""experts"" for guidance. After just a few weeks, my husband and found ourselves so confused and overwhelmed by all of the conflicting opinions and information that we decided to pack up all of the parenting books EXCEPT for Simply Parenting and listen to that voice alone. Dr. MaryAnn is clear, easy-to-understand and just spot on. An indispensable resource for any parent!"
2,"my first, and last, Grisham read","This was the first Grisham book I've ever read, and now, after reading this veritable Italian travel guide, the last Grisham book I'll ever read. No plot, no character development, no ending; these things describe this book. The most interesting parts of the book were the Israeli assasination team, or KIDON, and the Chinese hitman, but niether of them end up playing a big role in the book. I thought perhaps the main character, Backman, would eventually end up on the run being chased down by these assasins..but no, that would have taken to much thought on part of the author.Seriously, don't waste your time or money. Do not reward Grisham for a half-a$$ed effort."
1,Dont waste your time on this crap,"I would have to go with the people who gave this 1 star or even negative stars!!I picked this book in an airport store, to read during my long flight from New York to San Francisco and expected it to be another Grisham classic but this one definitely doesnt live up to the hype. Its not like Time to Kill, The Client, The Firm. Grisham is not an expert in writing a spy novel. The first half is more like a tourist guide to small towns in Italy..You'll be hungry for traditional italian food in like 100 pages. He takes too long to build up and the climax is awful. nothing ever happens.IF you want to read a fast-paced thriller, go pick a Clancy."
1,Boring,This is John Grisham at his worst and one of the most boring books I have ever read. He spends way too much time on Italy history lessons and Italian language that have nothing to do with the story. Take out the garbage and this book will be about 100 pages long at the most. Grisham needs to stay with legal thrillers and stay away from political thrillers - he is way over his head here.
5,Fantastic Realism,"As someone who was a Washington lobbyist and has visited Italy, I can say with some authority that Grisham has written another masterpiece. He describes rather accurately how things get done in Washington. His account of the chase through northern Italy was also well done. The intrigue keeps you in suspense until the very end. The only disappointment is the usual Grisham ploy of leaving to the reader the completion of the story line."
2,"Can you say, ""anti-climatic?""","The Broker starts out with an interesting concept and throughout the story, made me want to go visit Italy. However, the last 1/4 of the book was a total dud. It's almost as if Grisham loses interest in his own tale and wraps it up in a boring, half-hearted way just to make the deadline with the publisher. Also, the ""chase"" scene was not all that heartstopping. If you want something to really excite you, read Patterson's Four Blind Mice."
1,Not a typical Grisham at all!,Sofar I liked all Grishams. This one however is horrible. The main character tells us for half the book how he was aimlessly wandering around Bologna trying to learn Italian and then he is suddenly attacked by a genetically engineered Chinese assassin who can turn a coke can into a bomb (having two PhD's) ... among all other people trying to kill him just because the CIA wants to know who will.At that point in time I threw the book into the dustbin. How ridiculous can a story get ...Mr. Grisham: can I have a few more along the lines of the 'The Firm' or 'The Client' or 'The Rainmaker'?
2,Boring travelog with minimal story - a waste of time,"Grisham has got to be kidding with this ""novel."" I'm Italian and enjoy reading about Italy and seeing the Italian language at work, but when I want a travelog I'll buy a Guide. When I pick up a novel I want a story, not repeated language lessons, page after page, pagina dopo la pagina .If this book didn't have the Grisham name on it, no one, including me, would have spent time on it, hoping for some action. John, you owe me five hours of my life back. I'll take that in Euros please"
1,Lame ending,"Grisham must be starting to get like S. King - mailing it in for the check. This book has the same buildup for lame climax as the last 10 King novels. If you liked The Firm, or any of the other Grisham ""chase books"", you'll be disappointed by this one. Can I have my money back?"
2,Amateur plot.,"Thoroughly disappointing. The Grisham novels that I previously read are filled with intrigue and plot twists that keep one turning the pages. The Broker was completely the opposite. Very little intrigue, Instead it was mostly a lesson in speaking Italian. Characters were not developed, and many were left dangling. 400 pages of drivel. I gave it two stars because 1 star means I hated it. I paid full price for it and it's just hard for me to admit that I forked over that kind of money for garbage....so I gave it 2 stars to make myself feel better. I guess I'm too shallow. But rest assured, Grisham has moved to the bottom of my list and I've got a lot of books to read before I'll pick up another one of his."
3,I thought I was getting a paperback book!,"Somehow I ended up getting a hardback book, which is OK but doesn't look so good with my complete Grisham collection."
2,Not what I expected,"I loved the early Grishams, but had been disappointed recently. I was not expecting to be enthralled by this one, but I was....because I used to live in Bologna and so enjoyed spotting the familiar places, the errors in geography, the mistakes in the Italian! As to the story: slow, predictable, formulaic. Sorry."
1,warning label,"I've never taken the time to write a book review, but this book needs a warning label. If you like suspense, intrigue, spy thillers, intelligence, character developement, plot twists, or interesting dialogue, you might be more interested in ""Curious George"". The man with the yellow hat has more depth than Joel Backman.Halfway through the book it's obvious that Grisham spent some time in Bologna, and is eager to share that experience with us, as well as teach us all some italian, but a book called ""Travelogue to Bologna"" by John Grisham probably wouldn't sell. Wrap a ""B"" movie around it, advertise it at Krogers every 20 minutes on the p.a., add a spy novel cover, and you have a nice vacation tax write-off."
1,Made me long for the author of The Firm,"Rarely do I get half way through a book and just quit. I just couldn't hang with the plodding plot, repetition and boring do not a good novel make."
2,Alternate Title: Italian for Dummies,"This just did not cut it. Apparently Grisham has taken some of his book profits and taken an Italian Holiday. He needed to learn Italian...and viola`, The Broker.As with most of Grisham's work, a nice mindless book that does not challenge you like Clancy or Crichton."
2,"Better times, books and stories, far away from this one","Grisham waste a good plot and inmmerse himself in decorating Bologne. To much frosting with so few layers of cake.... The drama develops late in the book and with so many opportunities and characters it failed to bring the action on time, therefore, the book remains almost flat until the end. The author suddenly finishes the story as it looks like the editor calls him to Italy and remand him the final draft of this novel. Far from Grisham best!"
2,Basic plot and too simple,"I have read earlier Grisham many moons ago and so when I came across this book because I had time to read while headed to a dr's appointment I picked it up for a buck at the local library. Suffice it to say that this book seems to have been written in a short time and with little research into any of the major plot characters/groups. Not sure what JG's aim was here but if it was to describe Bologna and espresso he did it. Otherwise this book is good for passing the time while waiting in line at the local DMV or as I did, the dr's office."
2,Author justifies his Italian holiday,What a disappointment! Sadly it feels as if Mr Grisham went to Italy on holiday and kept a diary which loosely has the novel based around it. Perhaps he got some kind of tax break but one feels it from about one third into it. The story hangs on some long credulity stretches which feel terribly forced. Not recommended unless you are a Grisham and Italy fan.
1,"If you're going to write about learning Italian, get the Italian checked","I picked this up at my parents' house. It is mildly interesting for me having learned Italian and lived in both Treviso and Bologna. And usually I find Grisham's best feature is his plot. But the plot in this is boring, and it beggars belief that in a novel where the central character is learning Italian, and where Grisham is careful to include and translate much of that Italian, that he can't be bothered to get the Italian checked. Such elementary howlers, such as switching from the ""tu"" (informal) form to the Lei (formal) in the same sentence and back again, and having an Italian teacher address his new student as ""tu"" as an opener (that would not happen). Then things like ""Possiamo studiare a camminando."" Wrong. Or, even more embarrassingly, a basic error such as ""dov'é lavora?"" (where is he works?) instead of ""dove lavora?"" (where does he work). Annoying sloppiness and it has put me off bothering to finish it."
3,Not Grisham's best. And far from it.,"Even though the background of the character is a lawyer, the story is nothing related to court room, judges or law. It's more like a Tom Clancy's - spy and national security. Too elaborate on the Italy's sight seeing, especially Bologna, which doesn't really help building up the story, but a bit of dragging too long. The Broker doesn't have the sophistication like other John-court-room-focus fictions, but it looks like an amateur trying it's first attempt in spy fiction. Story too simple, ending too expected."
2,Not his Genre,"Having read all of Mr. Grisham's books, I was intrigued to see him venture into the CIA/Espionage realm- imagine my disappointment- He should stick to the law or satire, where his form is much better suited."
2,What a Disappointment,"I am puzzled why the author wrote about a topic he confessed of knowing so little. Except some knowledge of the Israeli Mossad, the author doesn't seem to have a basic grasp of foreign affairs. Every Chinese student was sent to the U.S. for spying? Give me a break!"
3,"Good Fun, But Not His Best Writing","This is a terrible book and a great read. Of course I'm biased-I love Grisham's stuff! This is good fun, but it's not his best work. It's as if Grisham is winking while you read, saying, ""I know it isn't very believable, and I admit I wrote it on vacation in Italy, but you asked me to tell a story, so here you are. What did you expect?"" At his best, Grisham is wonderful. In The Testament, The Firm, and more recently, The Last Juror, he catches the flavor of a locale and his characters become real people. At other times, however, it's as if we're all kids sitting around the campfire and he's telling one heck of a yarn. This is one of those. It's fun, but it sure ain't literature! Take it for what it's worth. Relax, kick back, and let him take you on an adventure. Then, when you're finished, leave it on the airplane or by the pool for the next person. You've been entertained on a boring flight or enjoyed your cruise, so call it even."
1,Travelogue and Culinary Guide - that's all,"This was a VERY disappointing read. Most of the book, I would say well over half, was Grisham letting us know how much HE knows about Italy and Italian food. He seemed particularly impressed with pastries. Mr. Grisham has also, apparently, picked up some of the language and felt it necessary to show that off as well.The characters are not well developed and the plot, though very interesting on the surface, is thinly followed. In the end, well, actually, it DOESN'T end. The story really just fades out. I was stunned to find out the last chapter was, in fact, the LAST chapter!There was a lot of potential to the story, but I have the impression Mr. Grisham wrote it while on vacation in Italy and, when he left, lost interest in the book.A poor read."
2,Not a typical Grisham book,"I have read and enjoyed most of John Grisham's books, but this one was a disappointment. Grisham sets up a weak story line that goes nowhere and tries to pass it off as a international thriller. There is a little military intrigue, ala Clancy but no lawyish excitement or thrill. I was waiting for the book to get interesting, then realized that since I was 2/3 of the way through the book, it wasn't coming. In the end, The Broker was a disappointing read and seemed contrived."
3,What?,"In response to the comparison between this book and Bailey's ""Cries of the Orchids,"" No Way! No How! The character development of the latter creats an emotional connection that leaves the reader unable to turn loose. I didn't get that in ""Bleachers."" While not his best work, his first five novels hooked me as a loyal Grisham fan (for life!)"
2,Grisham Wanted A Reason to Go To Italy,"It seems that the plot is an excuse for Grisham to explain why he enjoys Italy. As many other reviewers said the discussion of Bologna was fun, especially because Grisham loved the city. Plot was not believable or even important.The book was totally lacking in suspense and was far fetched. The saving grace is that the book had no pretense. It was just a pleasant diversion on two plane trips. I am not sure how one rates."
2,Not one of his best!!!!,"The Broker is based on a good story but right from the start,it resembles other Grisham thrillers while lacking the tempo,the brilliance ....All through the book I had the unfortunate feeling that it was written too fast,and not edited with care.Some parts are downright boring,time for John Grisham to ponder seriously on his writing.I expected much more from him!!!"
3,Decent book,"Decent book, a little too short on the substance, but nonetheless one that I read in a single sitting. I reccomend it for an easy read that is entertaining and a nice book for a cold evening"
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. It was boring, boring and really boring. There was no story. JAM who cared? To many characters with nothing to contribute."
3,Good storying telling as usual but sort of flat,"Grisham is first and foremost a good storyteller and for that he deserves credit. It's a dying art because it requires humility in a writer. Usually Grisham builds up the suspense perfectly until there's a big ending, but in this book the build up really didn't pay off. It was well written and quite descriptive but then....not much. Not bad, not great, but not up to his usual abilities, I'm afraid."
3,Wait for the movie!,"Joel Backman was marketing a computer program that would control a super-secret satellite system deployed by an unknown government. He was talking to various countries, who all believed that the program was worth hundreds of millions of dollars to them. He was a lobbyist and was connected to people at the highest levels of the US government, and it appeared that although the US wanted this program, he was preparing to sell it to someone else. Backman wound up in prison but was released by Presidential pardon at the beginning of the book, brought to Italy in a sort-of witness protection program, and he spent the rest of the book trying to erase the stain on his record, and on his conscience.But half the book is devoted to a travelogue of Italy, particularly Bologna, and I got the impression that the story was a vehicle for presenting the Author's fascination for Italy, rather than developing the plot.I expect that the movie will be more interesting than the book."
3,just ok,John Grisham haven't been writing too many good books lately. This one has its ups and downs. Overall story leaves a lot to be desired but I enjoyed reading about italian culture and food and how main character had to emerse himself in it.
1,The Broker is an Awful Book,"Grisham places an ""Author`s note"" at the back of this book in which he apologizes for knowing absolutely nothing about the subject matter. True, he doesn`t. If one takes this book as a ""Grisham Standard"" he has spent a lot of time blemishing his reputation. The plot is ridiculous,the dialogue unbelieveable. I say these things as a fan of his ""lawyer books"".Grisham should have put his ""letter of apology"" as a foreword, or better yet on the jacket cover as a warning to recoil from any thought toward buying this book.It appears to me Grisham cobbled this book together to pay for a vacation in Italy. He should have ""stood at home""."
2,Another one mailed in,"Several of our most readable authors are not working very hard any more. I would mention DeMille, Grisham, and Harris (he of the abominable HANNIBAL) as three of them. It would seem they have contracts to fill, and fill them they do, but the quality of the work deteriorates with each try. Grisham relies on his tried-and-true technique of having his characters do the same things except in different locations over and over again. It's not too exciting but it does manage to stretch this short story to book length."
2,A thriller? Nope. A good travelouge... nearer to the truth,"The Broker can hardly be called a first rate thriller (of any kind). Heck, for that matter, it isn't all that great a story either (too many lose ends, too many characters introduced for the sake of introduction but not given any kind of meaningful place in the story - case in point - the Chinese assasin).At the end of the day, the Broker reads better as a travelouge of Italy (even if Mr. Grisham did take some literary license on that point as well) than a thriller, which is a shame."
4,Grisham's best effort in quite some time.,"Finally, a new Grisham page turner. A great premise, a fast pace, and beautiful descriptions. The character development was done quite well, and the hook comes early in the plot.What's with all of the concern about Grisham's many references to the sights, sounds and smells of Italy? Personally, I felt it added much to the reading experience. With the heart of the story taking place in Italy, the details were very much needed. It gives you a reason to put yourself in Backman's shoes, to see what he sees, hear what he hears, etc. It gives you the chance to feel as unfamiliar as he does in Bologna, every sight, sound, and feeling a learning experience.The end seemed a little anticlimactic, but that can happen when the rest of the rising action is at such a high level. Nevertheless, a great page turner, a quick and exciting read, and Grisham's return to form."
3,Not Grisham's best but still some good points,"I found the plot a little weak and also a little incohesive/hard to follow. I enjoyed the backstory a bit more (about a guy hiding out in Italy from unknown people who may or may not be trying to kill him). I actually enjoyed the parts about learning the language & culture so that he could fit it (I'm a student of languages myself, and appreciate the challenges of learning a language). I enjoyed the book somewhat because of this, but wouldn't rate it as one of his best by any means. If you're not interested at all in learning a new language/culture and that sort of thing, I don't think there's much in this book for you."
2,UNIMAGINATIVE ENDING,"I have read all of Grisham's books, with the exception of Skipping Christmas. Obviously, I consider him an exceptional writer. Unfortunately, he has written a few substandard novels, including The Broker. The problem in each of these cases is that he lets the reader down with a ho hum ending. I felt this novel had a pretty good pace, but the ending was terrible...a real let down! It left me with the impression that he had written the required number of pages, so it was time to end the story. And he did. Come on, John. You can do much better."
1,No progress here,"It's hard to figure out where Grisham is heading as a writer. I am a late comer to his work - The Last Juror was my first attempt at reading him. One gets the strong impression that all J.G. is doing is writing for the big screen (I'm thinking here of adaptations like The Client and the even better movie, Runaway Jury); there simply is not much ""density,"" as Ms. Tartt would put it, to his writing. Is it so surprising, then, that he has 18 or so of these kinds of books out there? I find there is very little literary value to be found in this guy's writing. I say just wait for the movie - same cost as a paperback, but only two hours wasted. A.L."
3,Interesting Concept,I think the concept of this book is interesting just not enough action for me. I kept wishing something exciting would happen. Not the best book...kind of dragged on in the middle...really liked the ending though!
4,Every Author Deserves a Tax-Deductible Italian Trip,"This book has high tech, spy satellites, international intrigue, a lawyer who practices little law and a good chase.While the main character learns the history of northern Italy, savors the food and learns the language, not a lot happens. Who am I to hold a tax-deductible trip to Italy against a successful author?While it will not be remembered as one of Grisham's best, it is an enjoyable read. It deserves 4 stars."
2,"Italian lessons, yes. Thriller, no","Not Grisham's finest work. The book starts off with promise then turns into a combination Italian language lesson and travelogue. After several hundred pages, Grisham remembers that this was supposed to be a thriller of some sort and tells that part of the story, leaving one of the main bad guys out in limbo somewhere. Hope he'll do better the next time, but in hindsight, this is one that he could have skipped."
1,200 pages too long,"I have read all of Grisham's books. This one by far is his weakest. I did say it was 200 pages too long, and that is being kind. It could have been 250 pages shorter. I was really surprised Joel didn't put a bullet in his head from boredom, but maybe that was just me. Instead of writing a book every year, Mr Grisham should begin to follow Creighton example and write one every two or three. The only bright spot on the horizon is that Martini's new book will be out soon. Thank god for that."
1,"Good, but a Baedecker would have been better","Well, there's a survival Italian Kit phrasebook, many tips for Tourists ( for instance, don't drink Cappuccino in Italy if you aren't early in the morning ), and many descriptions about Bologna.What will you miss, are photo, that are an obvious asset, when you purchase a Guide, a plant of Bologna, and the plot itself ( you understand everything from page 1 ).I think there aren't many monographies about Bologna in English, and I appreciate the effort of the author ( warning! Law have strictly changed, and yuo aren't allowed anymore to smoke in a pub, otherwise you will be fined, up to 250 Euros ).Everything is accurate, save the fare in Eurostar from Bologna to Milan, that is far less than 50 Euros, even in first Class.Well, if you are interested in Bologna, purchase it; but you must have a city plant with you.If you are interested in legal thrillers, look for something else."
5,Great book,"The Broker, a great novel that I have really enjoyed reading I am a person who does not really like to read at all. The only things I would read were computer related stuff and short horror stories, because I could get in and out vary fast. I am on a businesses trip and decided to get a book to help pass the time. I found the Broker read the inside cover and thought it sounded good, well after 4 or 5 days now of having the book I have finished it. Now just to let you know I have not read a novel in over ten years and now I am vary happy to say that this will change now. If you get the chance read this book take it. Thank you for the time and enjoy. Pete"
1,Too Much Bologna,"I've never read Grisham (don't like courtroom stories) and after wading through this I'm done. It's a thin, predictable plot that is cluttered with endless lessons in Italian grammar and an almost Michelin-style guide to Bologna. Take those two out and you have a short story, not a novel.Also why bring in a would be assasin in the last 20 pages that is never mentioned again?"
3,"Average, for Grisham","Once you get past the middle of this novel, it becomes what you'ld expect of Grisham--first, however, you have to wade (scan?)through LOTS of tourist trivia about the cities and streets which he has obviously traveled through on vacation. Eventually, it is a good mystery. An unexpected ending!"
3,I Didn't Want To Throw This Across The Room...,"But I didn't want to tell all my friends about it either. ""The Broker"" is not one of Grisham's legal thrillers and is not as suspenseful as say ""The Firm"" but it was an ok read. I like the aspect of having Italy as a backdrop for the broker to hide for a little while but the storyline didn't really go anywhere. The so called ""romance"" that developed between the broker and Francesca was also too little too late. Grisham attempted a big buildup for the ending bit it was very anticlimatic. The more I read from Grisham the less I am starting to expect from him. Save your money and borrow this from the library like I did, you'll thank yourself afterwards."
2,What the?,"This is the second book of Grisham's I have read. The first was A Time to Kill, and, while I enjoyed it, it did have problems. I figured that all good writers tend to improve their craft, so I decided to get Grisham's most recent work. Big mistake. The Broker is not very good at all. The suspense and intrigue are pitifully absent. In their place are sprawling discussions of the Italian language and cities. Both of these may be interesting subjects in their own right, but I felt a little cheated by Grisham's obsession with them. Bait and switch I would call it. I thought I would be reading something akin to The Bourne Identity, obviously I was wrong.The Broker is a waste of time. If you read books precisely to while your time away, then it isn't so bad. If you read books looking for action and intrigue, read a Ludlum book."
2,The Critics were right...this is a bad book!,"I am a John Grisham fan... I have read and loved every book he has written...until today. I read The Broker in a day. There is NO character depth. The apex of this novel is barely recognizable. I am use to the heart racing Grisham novels and this is nothing but a short story dragged into 300 pages.And I would advise Mr.Grisham to never use the term, ""Took a pull off his beer,"" again as it was so over used in this novel."
2,Torturously Bad Fiction,"I could only read the first 100 pages.If you were to read this book, not knowing who the author is, you would deem it unpublishable.This is NOT an engaging page turner. From the first chapter, I realized that this book was written by somebody who has little expertise on the Washington political system. This is the type of fiction that you realize could never really be true.For example, we are to believe that one of the characters, Critch, who was at one time the President's Chief of Staff and political campaign chairman, can just walk around in pubs in London unrecognized by the public, after the election. Can you imagine Jim Baker, Colin Powell, etc. just walking around Europe in complete obscurity?Grisham obviously has enjoyed a few Italian vacations, and enjoys enlightening readers on the finer points of Italian cuisine and coffee beverages.So, save your money and read a classic, or buy yourself a nice Italian dinner instead."
2,This is not Grisham,"First half plain boring and worse. Second half decent with disappointing ending. Been a loyal Grisham fan up to now, but this is ridiculous. Contract filler, Grisham obviously bored to death writing this and could not care less about his readers. The only positive: he loves Italy and good ol' Europe."
1,"downgrade this mess to a 1 star or F, whichever is lower","I read the Onions very positive review on this album and I bought it. For all those who feel that Green Mind and other post Barlow Dino Jr. were great albums, please, dig out (or go out and buy) Bug and Youre Living All Over Me. This latest thing from J is more of the same whiney, ryhme-every-other-word-junk. Its all bad. Lyrically, this is as bad as things can get: ""Tell the truth now honestly"".. ok, what rhymes with honestly? ""Tell the truth why cant you see"".. awful. Enough whining over some girl that you 'know is out there' or about how bad you feel. Or at least do it with clever lyrics. This is pitiful songwriting and it has nothing to do with not being able to get out of the past like some reviewers think. I like one of the other reviewers reference to phone in solos. Mascis could do these solos in his sleep and theyre all the same. Hang it up, quit or find some new approach. This album is unlistenable."
1,This is NOT the CD everyone is talking about.,"This is a re-recorded collection of three of her biggest hits. It's a live recording and NOT the original.Her actual greatest hits CD links to this page. Don't make the mistake I did. Don't download, buy the CD. which ishere."
1,How can this be Sylvester's greatest hits without...,"...including classic Sylvester cuts like I NEED YOU, YOU ARE MY FRIEND, OVER AND OVER, etc? Another label trying to exhume the rotting corpse of the late, great drag belter to create a cash cow - beware!"
4,to survive the Christmas season w/o all the sugar-coating...,"Being a fan of the OmLounge series of discs, I was naturally drawn to this sound when I heard it in my local small bakery one morning. If you are, like me, someone who has had it up to 'here' with the gooey Christmas sound that we are generally forced to endure year after year, this is a refreshing slice of the season. While we all might have good memories of some of the tunes from when we were little..they've been recycled a few too many times in the usual format. However, this album gives you many of them, but with a techo or latin-flavored 'lounge'-mellow mix. Can't say I'm thrilled with every single hit: don't much care for their version of 'Silent Night', but I think I'll be able to survive this a few more years of ""the holiday season"" in the ""Reindeer Room""."
3,Not a bad CD but don't expect it to work on your PC,"This is a unique cd featuring some great chill-out versions of some holiday faves. The stand-out tracks are: Little Drummer Boy, Jingle Bells and A Child Is Born. There's also a bonus track of The Christmas Song. The Liner notes claim that they aren't able to divulge the names of the artists but that these guys have been around the downtempo and chillout scene for some time. Personally, I recommend the album. Technically, I think it's a load of cr@p when record companies purposely defect the CD so that you can't listen to it on a computer...."
2,Venison,I buy one or two christmas CDs every year and every once in awhile I get a stinker. This was one. I tried to like it. I liked the concept. It just did nothing for me.
5,cannot wait for this to arrive,"Although I have not yet got this dvd set I know it well from the tv showing.We all know this is probably the best show ever seen ,so to get it on dvd will be sheer joy.As the later series were never shown on Britsh tv I really HOPE they wll all be releasedEspec with Sub Titles.We cannao use closed captions./YrsPRINCE RAFAEL"
4,Great Season. Final Disc Jumps,"The program has stood the test of time! I would give 5 stars for the program, but the last disc had a scratch which made it lock up and jump. I used my Disc Dr. and the repair went well. The reverse side (I really don't like duel sided discs) also needed attention. This repair did not go as well. It would not even load when attempted on a Panasonic multi player. I moved it to a VCR/DVD Panasonic single disc player and it loaded and played, but still with a few skips."
5,who don't love this poster,This movie is fantastic so why not have a poster on your wall of one of the best scenes of all time!!! How do you call your lover boy??? My daughter absolutely loves it!!!
2,It is not worth paying for the update,"The original book was good, but this update is nothing but raking in money for a book that was good when it was published. You would think an updated version would have ONE picture, but know. I really wish I had not bought this book it was depressing."
5,Awesome performance,"I buy Princo DVD-R media with the white top on ebay and they work flawlessly in this burner. I love it and have no complaints. By now they probably have faster burners, but for the money you can get this for now, it's worth it. Burn overnight. In the morning, you're done. I wanted an all-format in case I need to play DVD+R, but most stand alone DVD players will play DVD-R. I stick with DVD-R media and this drive has been wonderful."
1,Bunch of Bull,The style of this game is completely outdated. It can get very monotonus making the game very boring. I've been playing these types of games since the nes and would know wether or not it is any good. You go and get missions in a town than go out to the same monotonus playing fields over and over again. And some of the missions are just completely stupid. The broadband feature is also a bunch of bull because I have alot of friends that wanted to get this game but didn't because it wasn't for dial-up. Plus the game seems to make it near impossible to beat the game if you don't have broadband and utilize the online feature.Overall: If you don't have broadband don't get this game. And if you do decide you might want the game rent it first just to be sure that the game isn't to repatative for you. And after all that if you decide to get it good for you.
1,Nice but noisy,The stand is nice but the fan is very cheap. Fan bearings went out within the first month. Stand now makes loud buzzing noise and doesn't move much air.
1,Disappointed,I bought this and it stopped working after a week. I realized the fan had become compressed & wouldn't turn - design flaw. Opened it up & fixed it. After 1 month it died again & I couldn't get it to work. Threw it in the garbage this morning and bought a Targus instead. Hopefully it will work better!
1,Broken fan,I bought this the other day from walmart. It lasted about three days before literally falling apart. I noticed the fan had stopped running. I unplugged it thinking it might start again later. I was wrong. One of the fan blades broke off and was causing it to jam. I pulled it out thinking I could recover it and it would be fine. It ran for a minuted then the same thing happened again.I took it back. Dont buy this if your looking for a cheap solution. Spend a little more to get a better model.
2,Not what I thought,This product was not for me.Fan - Noisy! I had to put a pillow in my laptop plus the cooling pad... Too much trouble... Returned it for a refund!
1,Broken Fan Blades in 3 Days,"I have owned this product 4 days and already twice a blade from the fan has come dislodged and stopped the fan.I am not abusing this product. I leave it on the bed, (no desk) and when I have come home from work two nights in a row, it has been broken. I am taking it back, you get what you pay for but this is ridiculous. Will be returning it to Walmart tomorrow."
1,Waste of money,"Used the cooling fan for a couple hours, then it overheated. Does not work now. Cooling fan overheating, to me this means a pretty bad product."
2,"Great, at first...","This was a nice quiet cooler for the first 2 months, then the fan died. I opened it up and checked for dust, this helped for about 3 days, then the fan died totally."
2,"Poor Construction, Cheap Materials","I received this product as a gift, and at first, it was fine. Within a month, though, the plastic stand broke off. This caused the whole thing to become unbalanced, and as a result, whenever i put my laptop on it without putting something underneath the front of the cooler, it would smoosh the fan and the fan blades would either stop, or break off. I had to take the whole thing apart several times to get the broken fan blades out. Overall, the cheapness of the construction and materials made this a very poor buy for the money."
1,Junk - Don't waste your money,"This laptop cooler is pretty much useless. It has one fan in the center that does an adequate job of cooling, but it's noisy and clunky. The design of the product is horrible. It's not conducive for lap use which is ironic since it's a laptop cooler. Don't waste your money on this garbage."
2,"Thought it was ok, then....","...the noise started. I bought this about a year ago and used it sporadically. Lately, and without ability it appears to correct, it started making ALLOT of fan noise. When I bought it, I did think it looked rather ""inexpensively built"" and now I know my thoughts were probably right. Friendly advise: keep your options open and if you like two brands/models, and this is one of them, think twice and move to the other one. Hope this helps someone."
1,Terrible Fell apart,The legs snapped off a week after I purchased the cooling pad. Made very cheaply!!! Make alot of noise a few days after receiving it! Bad product by Belkin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,A promising item with sub-par results,"--Must sit in a position such that the fan isn't directly over one of your thighs, or the fan will hit your thigh and not work.-USB connector has already shorted out"
2,i was disappointed,"i have this cooling fan and was totally disappointed. first, the stand on the back broke off and because my laptop is a little to big for the pad, the rubber strips that are supposed to keep the laptop from sliding, got chewed up by the bottom of the laptop. the blades broke on the fan and it got very noisy. now it doesnt work at all. i have had it for maybe a year. i have a dell widescreen 15.5 inch laptop. this cooling pad is too small for the laptop."
2,"Cheap, inadequate, short cord, loud. Dont buy.","Very cheap plastic and very flimsy. I had to position my laptop to the right so the air would cool the part that was getting hot (to the left), and it barely tipped and started making a deathly clicking sound. Returned to normal the next day, but it shouldnt be that fragile. The cord is super short and i have to turn the unit backwards just to reach the USB port near the front of my laptop! But it blows air and not sucks it through, which is good. But the fan is loud! Louder than my laptop fan when it works overtime, which is saying a lot. And who puts a fan in the center of the unit? That is not where laptops (at least any laptop ive ever encountered) needs cooling. Granted, I have a 17in, and this was not made for a 17in laptop. It puts a fair amount of air out and would be an OK fan for a smaller laptop, which is the only reason i gave it two stars. But you can buy cheaper 2 fanned cooling pads. Dont buy."
1,Dead after 2 weeks!,"I was so thrilled at first, it worked great! Then a week into it the fan starts making a horrible noise on start up, I tapped it and it would stop for a while. I don't use it heavily so imagine my surprise when it stopped completely this morning.. 2 weeks after getting it. NEVER AGAIN with this company!"
4,"Good so far, maintenance is easy.","I purchased this at a local retailer for 19.88 + tax in September. It's almost November and I've only had one problem with it: I plugged the stand into my laptop via USB but the DC input got pushed in. A screwdriver and 3 minutes later I set the DC input back straight and fixed the problem. Besides that, it's relativetly quiet and gets the job done. I was frustrated with the stand's instability until I figured out that you have to flip out the stand at the bottom for the laptop to be stable and elevated (duh!). They don't include any directions for that, so just a heads up to other reviewers that have complained about the laptop not being steady!UPDATE: 2-14-09 - fan stopped dead a few weeks ago. I read an article that Belkin has been posting false positive reviews. I'm peeved that this thing stopped working, now I have to spend an extra $30 in hopes I'll get a reliable laptop cooling stand, but I will definitely not get it from Belkin."
1,Works for a year then makes a lot of noise and eventually breaks,This fan worked decent for about 8 months but then it began making a lot of noise and then broke about 3 months later. Also the legs in the back collapse really easily and the usb chord is too short.
1,Buy something else!,"I had a two fan cooling pad, that after a year died on me. I went to Best Buy and had a choice between that one again, or this Belkin. I went with the Belkin and have regretted it ever since! It is noisier than my two fan was, VERY uncomfortable and in general just a pain to use. It is so bad that I just went and bought a different cooler, though this is still working just so that I can have a decent laptop cooling stand again.STAY AWAY!"
3,"Okay, but could be better","I like how it raises my laptop. I was having some neck strain and this device raises my MacBook about an inch. The fan also works fine. But I think it's a little noisy, as it run continuously while the USB connector is plugged into my laptop. When I get tired of the drone and the cool air, I just take it out. The noise is not super annoying. But unlike a desktop computer that you can store under your desk, this fan is much closer to my ears and can be pretty annoying. So would another cooling stand be better? I'm not sure, and would not be worth the cost to try. I'm rating this 3 stars instead of 4, because it's pretty annoying that the fan doesn't shut off once in a while. I keep on having to take the USB connector out when I don't want the fan, then stick it back in when I want it."
4,Very nice,"this is great for my laptop, it keeps it cool all the time I am very happy with this purchase, the only thing i don't like is that the stand on the back keep falling down when you try to put it up, other then that its a great product."
3,Fan Noise,While I think the unit does a great job keeping the laptop cool when I first boot up the machine the fan emits what sounds like loud bearing noise. After the OS boots up fully it quiets to a hush. It may be that the USB port is not receiving the full voltage (12 volts) that the fan requires. Other than that I feel better about using the machine all day because I can feel the cool air flowing from the unit. Great Product
2,It's okay...,"After about a month, I am noticing the noise is louder than my last Targus 2 fan cool pad. The fan cover is big enough for my fingers to stop the blade when I pick it up carelessly. The shape is effective at dispersing the air out the sides, just make sure you have the rear leg extended before you set it down, it will be sitting on the fan housing if not. The lifetime warranty is what sold me, but I won't take advantage of it when it dies."
3,No the best but for the price....,"it is certainly adequate!It is light and durable, inexpensive and if your going to use the macbook pro as a desktop certainly good as a permanant stand with a cooler. Not the best for lap surfing the Rain & Cool Master are better for that."
3,It was ok.,"This fan was ok. It lasted about 6 months. I finally had to get a new one when the leg on this one broke. The fan was still working, but the leg cracked off. This was a noisy fan."
1,Motor burnt out after 6 months,"I've had most laptop coolers let me down. This was my 5th. I've had Targus Brand USB cords break so easily and the motor burn out. So When Belkin was recommended, I bought this in August 2009.I must say it's almost equally as terrible. I found it to better than the others I've used in the past becauseA. It was quieter than others I've usedB. The cord Didn't break like others I've usedC. it lasted longer than others I've usedBUT It didn't last. That's the problem.I've had it since August 2009, So As I type this, 6 months, And the motor to the fan died.I'm tired of Electronics not lasting. They're trying to get as many sales out of a person as possible. They do the exact same thing with Movies and Video games, which is why Wal-Mart, Target, iTunes ETC. will get a bonus song, a bonus DVD, A Bonus something. What ever they can do to get paying customers to buy it more than once, They'll do itAVOID - it won't last."
3,Does the job,This does the job as far as keeping your laptop from overheating. The thing I don't care for is that it is awkward if you want to actually use this on your lap as it has a stand that is used to prop it up so it digs into your legs and occaionally collapses. Another flaw with the stand is that it is supposed to fold down but there is nowhere for the cord to go through so it does not fold down properly.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"We bought this about 5 months ago, it started having noisy bouts after about 3 months. It has been nothing but a source of frustration since then. We clean it, spray, you name it we've tried it. If these types of devices don't hold up well I see no reason to buy an expensive one. We just got our new one today,also from Amazon, a Syba with a huge fan for less than half what we paid for the Belkin, wow what a difference it's REALLY quiet and is in no way wobbly which was another problem with the Belkin. My advice is don't bother with this product, check out the Syba."
3,"Good, not Great",I was having problems with my laptop overheating and shutting down. I tried a couple of different cooling pads but they were junk. This one was okay at first. It did a good job of cooling the computer so it quit shutting down. The design could use some work. The fan sucks in lots of dust which sticks to the fan housing and starts to make noise after a few weeks. The slightest bit of dust would cause the fan to start grinding away. I've had to take it completely apart a few times to clean the fan and housing. It does do a good job when it's working properly.
1,Listing for F5L001 but received F5L055 model,"WARNING - item is listed as F5L001 model but that is not the model you will receive. If we had received the model listed in the description would have given it five stars. We have one of the F5L001 models and it is awesome - fan works great, lots of power, keeps laptop cool, and is quiet. However, we received the F5L001 model (which we had just bought at the store and were going to return and replace with the F5L001). The F5L055 model (which you receive) is not as curved and the fan does not have as much power. The stand doesn't fold down as on the F5L001. Not happy at all!"
2,Slip Sliding Away,T didn't like it at all.Kept sliding off my lap desk and laptop kept sliding all over the pad. I would have given it a 1 but my daughter grabbed it before I could return it and she likes it fine. so take your pick beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Will say it was very quiet.
1,Broke Very Quickly,I wish I had read reviews before I bought this thing! It broke after a month or two. Don't buy it!
4,Good for the price,"I purchased this because my laptop was overheating and shutting down on me. This cooling pad has enabled me to use the laptop for longer periods of time and no more surprise shut downs. It is more solid than other more expensive cooling pads that I have seen.The only issue that I have is that the flip out leg on the cooling pad doesn't lock into place, so it have folded up on me causing the laptop to suddenly drop down a little. It hasn't caused any damage, but it is startling and worrisome."
2,Did not cool my laptop. Fan is very noisy!,"I tried Gear Head's laptop fan and the thing basically fell apart in my hands...So I thought I would try Belkin, I always had good luck with Belkin. I was very disappointed with this product. I put my laptop on the Belkin and when I looked at the cooler after about a hour of working on the laptop I found a crack in the plastic case near the fan. The cooler was VERY noisy right out of the box. My desktop computer has a noisy fan and this cooler drowns out the noise of my desktop computer. So after a while I noticed that two fan blades had broke off of the cooler and maybe that is what is causing the vibration and noise. Will take this one back and try another one to see if its the same."
2,"It Works, But It's Not Durable","I purchased this cooler for a college student in 2007. Apparently, it broke before too long. This is may work, but not for someone who handles products roughly or stuffs it into backpacks. I had purchased aAntec USB-Powered Notebook Coolerfor myself and it still works fabulous. Although, it's a bit bulky and heavy for travel."
1,You Can't Be Serious!!!,"EVERY SINGLE ONE of my Belkin cooling fans has had the little fan spokes pop off!!! Oh, make no mistake... I wasn't foolish enough to actually PAY for more than one... I've just had to send like 4 back to them for replacements!"
1,Short Life Span,I've owned three of these now. The first got incredibly noisy after 3 weeks. I exchanged it and the second lasted 6 months before getting so loud it sounded like a plane was taking off. Then I was given another for a gift and I decided to give it one more shot - shame on me. The fan just up and died on me today. It lasted two months. I'll be going with something else now.
1,This is junk,"I've used this cooling pad for a few months. It's noisy, flimsy and a complete waste of money. Spend a little more and get a better product."
3,"works, but loud","I bought this because I had the same brand before that lasted me a LONG time. However, this newer modle (maybe able to cool faster) is much louder than the previous ones.This coolmat gets the job done if you dont mind noise"
1,Buyer BEWARE!,"Horrible product! Saw it in Big Lots and gave it a try - USELESS! Noisy, poor design, cheaply made trash! Hinged legs don't lock in place, so the whole thing collapses and blocks the air from circulating. ""Non-skid"" surface is worthless - laptop slips around like this was teflon. Cable on the USB is too short to accomodate a port on the LEFT hand side of a larger model laptop (mine is 17"") and the WORST - as soon as you power down your laptop, it stops cooling because its running off the laptop itself.I'm shopping for a better product! Should have listened to my inner voice screaming ""cheap won't work well!"""
1,"fair price, easy install (usb), broke within 2.5 weeks.",started making rattling noise after 2 weeks. would stop and start on its own after that. would hit it to get it started. and then it crapped out. 3 weeks total. would not try for another one. waste of time and shipping.
1,Short life span,I bought this item for my daughter for Christmas. She didn't use it until December 29th and the fan quit working on January 6th.
4,Cool cooling pad,"Just got this for my new laptop, it works great, is usb so you don't have to worry about finding a power source and isn't really noisy. The thing I really like about it is that it angles my laptop so typing is much easier. I've seen the other reviews, so I may have to update mine in the future, but let's hope not."
2,Belkin Laptop Cooling Pad Breaks in Less Than a Month of Use,"This is the second one of these I've had in 2 months, and both have broken within a month (each) of use. Very, very disappoined in this product, but happy with Amazon's replacement policy. Now if only I could find a durable laptop cooling pad!"
1,Cheap Junk,"This is a cheap piece of junk. The fan housing is thin, flexible plastic that causes the fan to rub on it and creates noise with the slightest weight on it. The fold up prop doesn't stay up and is very flimsy. It has suddenly collaped several times and scared the doo out me. The USB cord is very short. The only thing that makes this fan better than other cheap fans is that it doesn't have a cheap on/off switch that will break like most of the other available fans on the market."
2,"Works for a while, then gets crappy.","My husband and I have two of these. They worked well for a few months, then the first one started making a terrible buzzing sound whenever it was plugged in. Fast forward many more months and now #2 is making the same sound. I'll be looking for a different brand to replace these."
2,Does not work,This does not help at all. My computer still gets hot. There would need to be more fans toward the back where the heat is.
3,Still Unsure After Nearly a Year,"I've had this cooling pad for just about a year and, while it's still working just fine, it's really not WOWing me. When we moved to Miami in the dead of a scorching summer, I knew my Dell needed some extra help. Well, the cooling stand keeps the heat off my lap, but I need to keep the laptop/ cooling stand on a large photo album in order to even use it as it's intended: on my lap.Today, after months with no problems, my laptop refused to turn on for 5-6 minutes. I tried not to hyperventilate, but couldn't help but think that had this cooling stand done it's real job, this wouldn't be a problem.Make your own decisions based on all these reviews. Me? I'm probably going to buy another cooling stand with a few more fans."
4,looks good~,"it looks good~ nice and clean~ but not that useful~ Recommend U2 cooler, it has lot of hollows out, would more helpful~"
3,Dunno why I purchases a laptop cooler,"The cooler spins and pushes air, my internal temp guage for the laptop showed no temperature drop with this pad. I have a Quad Core i7. It cools it when it goes to standby mode.... I dunno. I don't live in Iraq so again pointless for me to attempt to keep the processor living longer. It's microcosmic attempt."
2,"Serves purpose, but only does that.",While it does cool my macbook pro it seems poorly made and as if it's just about to die constantly. My wire has got to the point where it shorts out when not in a specific position. Granted I've had the product for over a year it still seems as though it is a product at the bottom of the market and should only be looked at as a short term solution.
1,Maximum Carnage!,"This CD is an insult... Don't buy it! What you get here are not the original versions of these legendary tracks but very poor remixes. The company responsible for this bad joke is Unidisc, it is the second time I buy a CD produced by them and end up with silly remixes. Please be careful when buying stuff from this publisher."
1,More work than fun,"You have to do everything, even ride your horse while training and guide it around the track. Unless you have good motor skills (which I don't due to a disAbilty), it is not the game for you."
1,Wish I could have given less than one star,"It came from Alpha Video. What does one expect? Only cheapskates who prefer to buy by price and not by quality will be duped into thinking this is a quality product. Note: Anything that is an Alpha Video release is not worth buying. And more than half of their titles are available on Amazon from other companies like Roan, VCI and Sinister Cinema in MUCH better quality and almost for the same price. Stay away from this DVD!"
4,Great game for playstation,"This Godzilla game is great, I bought this game for my 10 year old son. My son has been playing this game since x-mas and has not stopped."
1,Horrible Plastic quality,I bought this last year after being caught off guard by a freak snow here in Washington. It took me all day to locate this one. I used it the one time and maybe once during the summer. I pulled it out yesterday to shovel the snow we got up here in the great northwest and it had a huge split right down the back of the shovel head. I made it 10 feet before it snapped off. Were am I going to find a snow shovel during a snow storm. I should have know better than buying something like a plastic shovel made in China. I guess part of this is my fault. I will be looking for a steel American made coal shovel for my snow shoveling duties.
1,Destructible Penguin,"Um.. My penguin's head fell off...? I want my money back. It's also very tiny, and upon arrival, one of the penguin's eyes were completely twisted upside down so it looks scary and frightens my children."
4,A truly mystic book,"A truly amazing book. although i found this book a little hard to understand but once i got used to the language i found it very interesting. It says ""world is an illusion' and through different philisophical and physical phenomenon has proven it to be correct ( atleast to me). a really good bokk the reader has to wear the writers shoes in order to understand it and enjoy it to its fullest"
4,A nice light read...,"Although not the absolute best of Patricia A McKillip's work, this is still a good read. I enjoyed it and would certainly recommend it. It's a fairly light work, but the characters still have enough depth to be interesting."
1,Pay for a good one,"I discovered a ""stirrup"" or ""scuffle"" hoe in an old house I came to live in, having never seen one before. It is now one of my absolutely indespensible gardening tools. I ended up with two very old ones - so old the cutting bar was half the width of its original size. This type of tool is designed to be both pushed and pulled. If you get a cheaply made one, the cutting bar will get bent and never be right again, even if you bend it back. I bought a True Temper model and it bent within a month. After bending in back many times and realizing it would never stay, I threw it out. Piece of junk. The True Temper design is flawed because there is not enough support for the cutting edge at the top of the hoe assembly. Do yourself a favor, spend more money and get one that is solidly built. This is a tool you should never have to replace."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this brace for knee cap pain before going to school for physical therapy. I used the brace but it didn't really help. Now that I am done with school and know more about patellar femoral pain I realize that if you are having sharp pains in the front of your knee due to patellar tracking problems, this brace will not help you."
1,WAY TO SMALL!!,"BEWARE!! This item is 4"" in diameter!! Looking at the picture it sure looks bigger. I own other Joyce Chen things and am VERY Happy with them, But I just rec'd this and will be sending it back. Not worth $19.99, maybe $4.99 and I'd keep it."
1,Frustration ahead,"This book consistently uses terms for buttons, icons, menu items, etc. that are inconsistent with the actual names in the program itself. This makes it extremely difficult for the new user to confidently navigate Pro Engineer for the first time. A lot of rather simple steps are omitted, that may not be a big deal to a seasoned user, but to a new user, it just causes frustration. Plus it doesn't come with the CD for chapter 2 and on. I would avoid this book and buy ""The Essentials of Pro/E"" which actually comes with a CD, and is a lot better with the consistency of their wording, although there are still a few mistakes here and there."
2,"Boring, confusing and not sturdy","I was very exicted when my son got this game for Christmas, but my excitement was short-lived.1. The game pieces are flimsy: four tiny cardboard boxes that fold together. Even before we played the first game, one of them was coming apart. There is no way that these pieces will last more than a couple weeks.2. The instructions aren't clear. Are players supposed to stop at the ""food"" spaces no matter what, or only if they land on them? We played both ways.3. Both ways were dull. It is just not very exciting or imaginitive.The only good thing is that the game should fall apart quickly, so I'll have an excuse to get rid of it."
2,"Big Caterpillar fans, but...","This game is just not very good. My son loves the idea of a Very Hungry Caterpillar game, so we ignore the not-so-clear ""rules"" of the lame-o game and try to come up with alternative ways to play with the pieces - but all in all, it's just pretty uninspired. Unfortunate. We really want to like it."
1,So disappointing,"I have to agree with other reviewers. My 3-year-old loves to play games and I'm tired of what we have, so I picked this up on a whim at a local store.I'm sad to see something with Eric Carle's name on it so unimaginative. Shame on University Games for dropping the ball with such a clever book as an inspiration. I also found the instructions confusing and the game play monotonous. I'm not sure what the learning emphasis is here - some counting involved, taking turns. But no real decision making or strategies. I'll return it if the store will take it back opened."
1,A huge disappointment - poorly designed,"I was so pleased when I heard this game was being manufactured - we love Eric Carle's work! We were very disappointed - this game was designed for small children, yet does not meet any criteria as far as I can tell. It does not hold thier attention. It is not durable or sturdy - as other reviewers have mentioned, the game pieces are incredibly flimsy. The instructions are not specific. The educational valuable is debatable. If I could, I would give this game 0 stars. Hopefully the pieces can be recycled. I write this review in hope that other parents will be spared the expense."
1,Echoing the Other One Stars,"I fully agree with all the one star reviews, and am only writing this to add to the one star reviews. After opening and playing for the first time this evening, I searched for it here solely to read the reviews of others since I was so disappointed and was wondering if I was the only one in this camp. Arghhhh that I probably can't return it since we've so obviously punched out the card board food and assembled the catepillars that don't even fit on the pieces."
3,Good but clunky,"I grew up on the east coast using a much smaller, and faster manual weed cutter. When I bought this one, I thought it would be comparable.I would echo the earlier comment that this design is much too heavy for extended use. It feels like swinging a hefty baseball bat that has no grip. The cutting action worked well for me but I couldn't swing this thing more than 5-10 minutes before my hands and arms got tired.I'll keep this one around for heavy weeds but I'm going to look for a lighter model to do the majority of my weed whipping with."
3,Nice tool but needs modifications to work well,I purchased mine locally at Lowes. I saw a similar tool at Home Depot. I used one of these as a kid to trim grass at a lake cabin. The blade on this one was dull once the paper cover was removed. I'm going to sharpen it before it using so it will cut well. The handle is too short too unless you are about 5 foot tall. I'm looking for an old shovel handle I can re-purpose with this weed whip. After sharpening and lengthening the handle I expect this to be a great tool. It's too bad it wasn't made right to start.
1,Writing a book for the sake of writing a book?,"This book reads as if the authors were trying to teach themselves interfacial instability. The problems are old worn-out, and the ""essays"" (each chapter, that is) are simply re-working of what is in the technical literature. The book does have some value, and should be useful to graduate students, but the authors could have chosen many problems of current interest with rich applications and pedagogical value. The topics chosen are fron classic papers (Lord Rayleigh, Saffman & Taylor, Chandrasekhar, etc.). Get Xerox copies of the original papers and save a bundle! The book is not worth the price (roughly $....)"
4,Good Quilting Instruction Book,"My mother gave me this book when I began to quilt. It gives great basic instructions on overall quilt making, from design to completion. There is even a section on the criterion by which quilts are judged at shows. Except for the classic pieced designs, this is incredibly dated now. (Some of the 70s-80s designs and colors featured look hideous and downright laughable.) Because this was written before the invention of the rotary cutter, the quilt piecing instructions are dated, too. But if you want good instructions on traditional pieced blocks and hand quilting, this is a good source. A well-loved favorite on my bookshelf."
3,Kind of a drag is still a bit of a drag,"I bought Mercy, Mercy Mercy: A Collection thinking it was a good buy, but then after reading other buyers comments i found it to be true... the remixed Kind of A Drag lacks the original punch. Then I bought the reissued album, thinking that recording should original, nonetheless, but still Kind of A drag sounds exactly like the remixed version...."
4,Does the job,This is a decent product that is sturdy and sharp enough to prune blackberry bushes as well as grass and weeds.
1,CUTS NOTHING!,"My grandmother used to have an all-metal grass scythe that really worked well. I ordered this knowing it had ""teeth"" figuring it would hold the grass for the second it was being cut, but the edge is so coated that there are practically no teeth and it cuts nothing! Imagine someone coating the edge of your kitchen knives with baked-on enamel, and you get the idea. I don't know if one of the other straight edge weed cutters would have been better, but I'm not going to waste any more money finding out. My advice, don't buy this, and, sell your old jewelry, but don't ever sell your old tools, because they just don't make 'em like they used to."
1,Useless,This tools is useless. It won't cut grass and it won't even break weeds.The blade is serrated so I cannot sharpen it. It is light so it won't move fast enough through the grass.I will buy a real scythe.
4,FlipShield for half-helmet,We just bought some scooters and half helmets but needed a face shield to block the wind. We don't ride a lot but these shields were exactly what we needed. They work perfectly!
1,jafrum is not so good,"got the visor in a reasonable time frame, but it was missing two, of three, buttons. contacted jafrum. they said it would be faster to get a refund then to exchange it. i sent the product back, requested a refund, and a month later still have not received it. beware of this seller."
1,Not Funny,"Really, this isn't much of a book. 53 pages the size of a greeting card. It might have been funny fifty years ago."
4,This is not the usual book written by a consultant,"Usually the book written by consultants keep some of the most important aspect of the technique on which they are writing or do not give all the infomation so that you have to call them to do the job. This is not the case with this book. Mr. Lee just put everything he knows about facilities design in this book in a way that can be easily followed by any one interested in doing facilities and workplace design. Areas for improvement in the book are related to the quality of some of the charts that I found a little difficult to read because of the small font size used. Nevertheless, this is a fault of the publisher and not of the author. If you are looking for a ""how to do it"" in a simple and straightforward way, without any unnecessary material, you this is the book."
5,I'm glad it has violence against women,Tenjho Tenge is a seinen anime and manga series drawn and written by the manga-ka Oh! great.The manga is currently running in Shueisha's Ultra Jump in Japan. The manga is being officially published in North America through Dc comics' CMX imprint.
5,2005 Writers Notes Book Award Winner,"From Florida's west coast, comes a seafood lover's delight, which also includes terrific meat recipes and scrumptious appe-tizers. Our food reviewers like nothing bet-ter than to find good recipes for Sunday brunch. ""That's the time when people sit around the food for hours,"" said one judge. ""Food goes under the microscope. It needs to look as good as it tastes."" Beach Appetit conjures the essence of lazy weekends on the beach and a perfect meal to boot."
5,Another Nashville Star,"I'm an avid country music fan and this is one of the best country CDs I've heard in a long while. This guy is the real deal. Since I got this CD I have played it daily and will continue to play it for a long while.Just about every cut on this album is a winner. john Arthur is a wonderful songwriter. His voice is smooth and winsome. The songs on this CD have a simple, genuine feel -- it isn't like listening to top-40 fodder or something prefabricated. These songs and the delivery are authentic and feel as if they come from a real person, not an image. My particular favorites are the upbeat ""A Girl Named Texas,"" the amusing ""The Armadillo Song,"" the catchy ""Tonight at Fiesta,"" the sultry ""Trouble Rides a Fast Horse,"" the romantic ""River of Love,"" and the heartfelt ""Lone Starry Night."""
2,was disappointed,I purchased this CD for someone for a gift. I saw that it was remastered and assumed the sound quality would be improved. I was very disappointed and ultimately embarrassed that I had sent someone such poor quality of sound especially after I had paid more than $30 for the CD.
4,In the Begining...,"WOW! ""Body & Soul"" is a high energy song that has a great beat. This single put SPEED on the charts and helped introduced one of the best jpop dance groups in the Okinawan style of jpop. I liked the original version of ""Body & Soul"" compared to the Hand Bag Mix version, but anyone will surely enjoy either one or both. The instrumental version is a standard for all SPEED singles. ""I Remember"" really shows off what the lead singers Eriko and Hiro can do, along with the harmony of Takako and Hitoe, with a more relaxed song. An excellent buy to get a taste of SPEED."
2,Don't buy it!,"This was my 4th Sony camcorder. Although the Video and Photo quality improved from generation to generation the reliability got worse and worse. After less than 2 years of non intensive use, my HC7 video started to vibrate after around 20 minutes. Sony asked around $800 to fix it (change of main board). I read on the internet similar stories. I gave up and purchased this time Pana."
4,FINALLY RECEIVED MY HDR-HC7,"After receiving wrong camera I finally received the right camera about a month ago.I am very pleased with it. Specially pleased with the close-ups and the flash. This camera lets you take good quality videos, and also good quality photos (haven't yet tried the high definition).The only problem I had is that the memory stick was damaged while taking pictures and I lost all the pictures taken on an outing with my grandson (memory stick doesn't work at all) . Anybody know why this happened."
4,Unfortunately this book is starting to come true now,"This book when I first read it was just a good read and then in the last year with the comments from Gore, Hillary, Obama and other Democrats I see it coming horribly true in the next few years. If you are a liberal Democrat or antiwar you will hate this book because it brings into question everything you believe. For everyone else this is a horror story of what would have happened if Gore had won the Florida recount and then used all his political correctness run wild just as he does now in his speeches to give Bin Laden a blank check to carry on his war. There is no happy ending as laws are passed against conservative talk shows in the name of balance and the armed forces have their budgets pared to nothing because we need the money for the unfed masses. In the end Bin Laden's children rule."
3,"Cute, but not a big hit","We bought this for our 2-year-old daughter's birthday. The set is adorable no doubt, but I think I like it better than she does. She was enchanted by it for several months, but then put it aside. I'm wondering if she just didn't know how she was supposed to play with it. There are three fairies, three chairs and a table. Honestly, I didn't even have enough imagination to play with it for very long.The quality is good, although the stitching came out of where the table top attaches to the base within the first few months. I haven't attempted to repair it yet, don't know how difficult it will be.It is a perfect toy to bring along with you, as it is very portable; everything stores inside the house. We keep it in the car for times when ""quiet play"" is appropriate.Maybe I will introduce it to her again in a few months, when her imaginative play skills are a little more advanced. It is so cute I don't want to give up on it."
5,Great service,Great service and price! Product was delivered on-time and works as described. I would highly recommend this seller's products. Great job!
3,Sort of spooky,"I was hoping for stories, as in a beginning, middle, and end. What was encountered were brief descriptions of events."
1,"Bad, not even worth the price of FREE!","I couldn't even get past the first chapter, and I'm the kind of reader that has to finish abook before starting another one."
4,Works as intended,"I am using this to hold the hose at my marina. It was easy to attach to the wooden piling with three screws (there wasn't room on the piling for the fourth), and so far it has handled the elements just fine. Time will tell - 4 stars for now."
5,Cool Black Sabbath Book.,"Hi there folks, I am new to Amazon so please bear with me. I would just like to say that I read this book and was so impressed with it, that I wanted to let other folks know about it.I have been a fan of the original Black Sabbath for many years, and first saw them live in Kansas City (Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall) way back in the seventies.They were fantastic, and brought the house down.But time moves on, and I still play all the old favorites to death; Hole in the Sky, N.I.B., Black Sabbath etc, etc.This book brought loads of memories flooding back to me from my 'heady' Collage days, I just could not put this book down and read it in one sitting, you just seem to feel the vibe of the day from the Authors writtings.Great book, great story & photos, very well written.Bern."
3,Entertainment for Sabbath fans only,"This is an entertaining book,but I would mainly recommend it for Black Sabbath fans only.As it states on the cover it is unauthorized.Although there are some good early photos of the band the text is made up of personal reminiscences and therefore is not very objective.All in all,it's a good book,but just don't purchase it for the teenage Ozzy fanatic.I happen to be a major Black Sabbath fanatic in my late thirties and the reason I got this was because I want all the information that I can get on the group.I love Black Sabbath in all its incarnations and am offended by those who say that the ""Ozzy years"" were the best.I'm really looking forward to seeing the Ronnie James Dio line-up on the road next year.'Nuff said."
2,Sabbath sucky Sabbath,This book is definitley not a must read. It talks mostly about the roadies and not the members of Black Sabbath. I would definitley pass on this one.
4,Update for a thirty year old model,Update for a thirty year old model looks a lot nicer and keeps the temps where they should be finally.
3,line-in thermostat,"These appear well made, I figure you can trust Honeywell. The unit sticks out from the wall a lot more than I expected, so it is not 'unnoticeable'. The temp reading/setting seem to be far from perfect. I bought them for small baseboard heaters that are undersized for the rooms, so I don't expect alot of cycling. If you want good temperature setting accuracy, get a digital unit for about 20-30 dollars more. These don't require batteries and should probably last forever."
3,Favorite when I was a little kid,Doesn't hold up. Loved it in the 60s when I was little. My kids don't get it.
1,AVOID THE CANON ELURAS,"If you listen to the noise that the tape does, in your first day using your Canon Elura 65 camera you can predict that it is not a product made to last a lifetime. Canon Eluras are the most unreliable cameras in the market. This line of cameras have a structural design flaw. After approximately one year of use, your camera refuses to accept any tape, and the tape compartment does not close. This happens regardless of how often you use your camera or how gently you treat it. Canon refuses to acknowledge that their Elura line is flawed, but just do an online search of the reviews about the Eluras 40, 50, 60, 65 and 70. You will see that there is a bunch of people out there with the same problems. Some are even considering a collective lawsuit against Canon. I read the bad reviews and decided to spend $500 on a Canon. Lost my money and my camera (one week after the expiration of the warranty the camera broke). I took my chances. Will you take yours?"
1,in two words: Doesn't work!,"If you have a serious plumbing problem, this is not gonna help, after using this product I am sceptical this could clean even a minor obstruction.... the air blowed out doesn't have enough air that will clean out your drain.... I would recommend don't waste your money buying this product, I ended up hiring a plumber."
1,item not one in picture,"The item i received is not the one in the picture. it is smaller/thinner, straight not at a 90 and has less volume then the one in the picture because it is 9.5"" in dia and the one in the pic is 11.5"" in dia."
2,Stops working,This product stops working after a while. The pressure release valve prevented air from being compressed in the pressure chamber.
4,New product works great,"Hi all I just wanted to tell you that I purchased this item to replace a nother item due to supplies not available. The Cobra product works great. Throw those dangerious chemicals away (drano, heat, mr clogg) and get your self one of these. It actualy works so well that Im unclogging a drain in 5 minutes. Im a handyman so I use it alot. Stop paying those high plumming bills and get your self a corbra blaster. If you are in the Hartford,CT area or surrounding towns you can email me at thehandyman9@att.net if you are having trouble around your house and dont know how to fix it.Cobra Products 650 Air Drain BlasterThank youDave"
1,Don't do it; You know better...,"This item is a joke. You are only looking at this because you don't want to deal with a pipe snake or other messy solutions to a slow drain, but you are asking for trouble. This thing might make a great potato gun, but its no drain clearer. It blows water back in your face, and if there is a weak spot in your plumbing, this will help you find it in short order. The other more reliable solutions are cheaper, and are less likely to cause damage to your pipes. Don't waste your money.Cobra Products 83250 1/4-Inch-by-25-Foot Metal Drain Clearing Drum Auger"
5,Good Gadget,"Great little gadget, does the job it is for, easy to use and has many functions, would buy again worth the mony"
3,Great Scent but Not Does Not Last Long Enough,Polo Blue by Ralph Lauren has a great scent but it does not last long enough and dissipates too quickly. My expectations were higher for this Ralph Lauren production. Quite unfortunate when I think about. I was somewhat disappointed.
3,"These socks go too high, especially for a ...","These socks go too high, especially for a man. If it's a hot day it'll be too hot to wear them. They're not very comfortable, but they do give support. In my work place, I don't really stand all day, and it's not useful for me to wear them, but I'm sure if you do stand all day, they'd be beneficial."
1,"I want to know about this case, but must find a better book.","So poorly written it's work to turn pages. The writers need a tharusarus, or better yet an editor. Constant use of a handful of words, I think the redundant ""prototypical"" was used at least 7 times in the first 30 pages alone, along with relentless unnecessary (parenthesis) and ""quotation marks"", combine to distract the reader in a most annoying way. Very little insight into the the criminal and victims lives through family and friends, the story seems to be told exclusivly from the police perspective. Throw in a large dose of gratutious vulgarity and you come up with a book that is a real chore to get through."
4,Yum......,They smoke - they flavor - they are inexpensive and shipped free with Prime. What more do you want? Only thing keeping this from 5 stars in in need to be in a resealable bag.
3,Good product - bad company support,I had a broken plastic clip on a part. The box says call a toll free number and get parts replacedquickly. The toll free number is now a recording directing you to a web site. The web site hasyou fill out a form and then you must FAX your receipt to a non-toll free number. Consider thiswhen purchasing the product as support may be difficult.
1,This product is annoying and is poorly built,"If you're looking for a quality hose reel, look elsewhere. This reel is cheaply made and literally falls apart every time you reel up your hose. For the money they charge for this, it should be capable of lasting more than 1 season. This one won't."
2,"rather corny, not substantial","This book has good intentions, but they are not carried through in the text. The writing is rather flowery and general and by the end of the authors call *research*, you don't really find out what that research was. I was looking for a book to recommend to cancer patients who want to use self expression as part of their healing, but this was not the book, I ended up returning it."
5,post surgery need,after surgery i had extensive swelling of the ankles.these most certainly have been a help to me.i made a goodpurchase. i shall do so again .
1,"Nice design, cheap product","Cheaply made. 1st couple of rolls, it bent. Couple more rolls, it bent some more. A few more rolls and it bent so much gears no longer turned, nor could the edger keep a straight line. That was it. We purchased ours at Home Depot, and returned it."
1,Stay away,This edger broke in the first foot of my driveway. The design is just pathetic. Unless you like returning broken purchases get something else.
3,Muscle Needed,"If you are not very strong, I would opt for a different edger. I cannot use the product. I am going to try a step edger. My fried has had some success with this edger, but it seems that the amount of strength it takes to actually edge will soon break the tool."
2,why?!,why do the b damans horns always fall off?! why do the helio arms not add power?! why do i use this b daman for spare parts?!
1,this sucks,"its damn helio horns keep falling off, and it sucks. Don't buy no matter what. IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Falls apart/junk,"These little figures have to be assembled out of the box and let me tell you...it will take the average adult approximately 20-30 minutes to completely assemble ONE. Need I say more? You must first snap the pieces out of a plastic frame and this is painful on the fingers. Also as you proceed with further steps in the assembly, when things need to be snapped together or inserted into something, there is a good chance the entire thing can just fall apart with pieces falling everywhere! Very frustrating! The whole toy is only about 2 inches tall. The only reason I gave this toy ANY stars at all is because my son did play with a couple of figures I got together for a brief period of time and really enjoyed them, but heed my warning... this lasted about 20 minutes and he quit because they were falling apart and too difficult to fire balls w/out it falling apart.The quality of the material is not even close to a fast food toy. Really. And then the stickers.....OH the stickers!!!"
4,The Merchant Marine Manual 1918,"I have an original edition of the 1918 Merchant Marine Manual (Very Good condition) which was presented to my grandmother, who was then a young lady living in the Boston, MASS area. Her full name, in gold letters, is embossed on the cover: the page ends are gilded in gold as well. She was engaged to my grandfather at that time, who was then serving in the U.S. Navy (deployed to the United Kingdom.) There is no (surviving) family knowledge/record that my grandmother was involved in Merchant Marine volunteer work in 1918, and it is a mystery why she should have this Manual at all, let alone a personalized presentation copy. Just wondering what this 254-page, pocket-size book (6"" X 4"") might be worth to a collector of Great War-era merchant marine books."
1,Ames 2384675,"Do not waste your time buying this plastic hose reel, in the hot Arizona sun this piece of plastic has fallen apart the hose to the wall split the fist week, it leaks water from where the hose connects to the reel and the handle to wind it up is loose. If I had saved the box I would have retuned it. Buy a metal one"
5,Don Martin at his maddest!,"""Don Martin Bounces Back"", first published in 1963, continues the misadventures of Fester Bestertester and his hulking, pea-brained pal Karbunkle (created by Martin a year earlier in ""Don Martin Steps Out""). All of their stories are funny, but ""National Gorilla Suit Day"" tops them all (and everything else the artist did for MAD from 1956 to 1987); it became the favorite of MAD publisher William M. Gaines."
2,JohnnyNo,"The SDDR-31 didn't install correctly on my computer (windows 98se w/ AMD processor). I Called Sandisk tech support and they were able to get me up and running. Only one problem, my computer hangs up when I start the computer with the SDDR-31 connected to the USB port. The computer boots up fine if I disconnect the SDDR-31 and reboot. Then I can connect the SDDR-31 and it's operational (does everythng it's supposed to do). I spoke to Sandisk tech support once again and they told me to try downloading a patch from Microsoft. That didn't work. I'll keep trying."
2,Start up problems,"The reader causes my computer to hang up when started with no compact flash card in reader. If the reader is connected to the USB port with no card in the reader, my computer will not boot nor can I shut it off. The system must have the power turned off and turned back on. Then you must disconnect the reader. Once the system is turned back on it comes up in safe mode and must be then shut down again.Once the system is booted, the reader can be plugged in and everything works ok, but this is hard to do since the USB ports are on the back of the computer, on the floor. Sandisk tech help was worthless. They blamed everything on every other vendor, yet my computer works fine with every other type of USB device with no problems. They have a problem with the PnP Bios Function."
3,m.e,I have M.E and it locks-up quite abit when trying to take the card out.Kind of a pain.You have to reboot to get the card out.
1,LISTEN!!!---u'll know y I rated it 1-* but if it wasn't like that I'd give it a 5!,This is written in Spanish so don't buy it not knowing like I did caue I thought it was i English and I didn't look at the product details so now I have a book I can't read!!!
2,this product needs something,"I bought this as a father's day present & found out that the AAA batteries included weren't for the reciever, they were for the remote. The receiver needs a $150 base to charge up. I thought it was a stand-alone reciever that he could use with a headset on the beach; but that was not the case. The description should be updated with the info that it needs to be purchased with something else to work.On the other hand, we like Sirius. We bought a car that had it built in & we activated a trial. It has a channel or 2 that everyone would like & the service is good so far."
1,DON'T BUY THIS TRASH!!!,I purchased this receiver on a Sunday and on Thursday it stopped working. I would turn it on and all that would happen is the sirius logo would freeze on the screen. You can buy a much better receiver from a reputable company for about the same price like JVC or Kenwood. Who has ever heard of Xact anyways? If all of their products are this crappy they will be out of business in no time. Take it from me and all the other reviews DONT BUY THIS RECEIVER.
1,There are better receivers out there...,"I purchased the Xact XTR1 last November when I first subscribed to Sirius. I have been disappointed with this item since the first day. First, the item was very cumbersome when I tried to fit it onto my car's console. Second, the boombox accessory has horrible tone - too tinny for my ears. Third, and most important, the receiver gets *very* hot. The unit hasn't overheated but I am very nervous about using it. I've owned this unit one year and am going to ditch it for a newer receiver.There are better receivers out there...."
4,Cad mic is pretty fun,"so this mic is pretty versatile. sounds great on omni with my acoustic guitar, it records my amplifier very well as a room mic with the pad switch, also sounds pretty decent on vocals set to cardioid. still testing on the drums, but so far, nothing to complain about. i will say that i had to send the first one i got to CAD because it was buzzing when you'd touch the dial, they sent me a brand new one, and it is fine."
3,Mabye I just got a bad pair...,"They are pretty good for the price. Very good at drowning out background noise and fit very comfortably. The only major drawback was that the sound seemed to be louder in the left speaker. This was very annoying however I am pretty sure I just purchased a bad pair. Other than that they do get a little hot after extended use. Overall not a bad pair of headphones for the price, but I will be returning mine and probably upgrading to a high-priced headphone due to the unequal volume problem."
2,"OK headphones, but you can get far better","The sound quality is OK, but the bass on these leaves LOTS to be desired. If you listen to any music with lots of bass you will definetly notice, and I strongly suggest other headphones. I owned a pair of KOSS headphones prior to these and will be buying a new pair of Koss after I return these."
4,I love a good skirt!,"This is one cute sexy mini and is great for showing off your legs. Like the picture, it's really sexy when worn with a see-through top, or even no top ;-) I have tried both when wearing this skirt and can vouch for the admiring looks. Get one, you know you want it!"
4,Staple on Canadian radio,"The third album by Toronto's Foot in Coldwater is a solid effort by a solid band that is best remembered for the 1972 single Make me Do Anything You Want. That being said, the version heard on this album is a remake - odd, seeing that the original was on their debut album just a couple of years before. The arrangment is very similar, though there are some noticeable differences. Three singles were released from All Around Us: (Isn't Love Unkind) In My Life; Love is Coming; and the monster kick-butt instrumental Para-Dice. They always sounded great on the radio (and, apparently, live) but never cracked the big time despite good songwriting, inspired performances and some very creative recordings. Their singles didn't reflect the fact that they were a very hard rocking outfit, but it makes for interesting albums, of which this is no exception."
5,Best Sounding Headphones Available,"I first saw these in Hong Kong. After beating it up traveling for a year it broke. I loved it so much that I bought another one. This is the only online store I found it on. These headphones pump out some quality. The frequency response of 10-25,000 Hz and inpedance of 16 Ohms really gives your music some nice bass. You rarely find spec like these for this kind of price. I've tried some other Aiwa headphones and returned them cause it was obviously all looks and no qulaity. The swoop style is sexy and the design is convenient for sports or any other actvities ex. sleeping. This one gives the whole package."
1,Disappointing,"IMHO, this doesn't yield any valuable conceptual insights into humor.If you're interested in the cognitive patterns behind jokes, comedy etc. you might want to check out Arthur Koestler's ""Act of Creation"" instead. He sets out to discover common patterns behind creative acts in humor, art and science and comes up with very broad original insights that I found very enlightening.Another interesting (and more formalized) attempt to conceptualize creative thinking (including humor) is being developed by some cognitive linguists (Gilles Fauconnier, Mark Turner). Their concepts seem to go along very well with Koestler's findings. You might want to check out their book ""The Way We Think""."
1,A Waste Of Time,"I'm currently taking psychology at my school. I chose, for a project, to do a study on humor. As a book resource, I found this, and had high hopes for good scientific and correlational information. Provine has failed to write anything worth taking notes over in this book. He comes up with good questions but doesn't explain any answers, simply stating what other psychologists have done wrong in the quest for the answer. In the end, the book leaves us empty and full of questions and hopes that are never fulfilled. Also, he spends a lot of time placing gender stereotypes that have and never will be proven true in any context. This book was a waste of time for him to write, and a waste of time for us to read. There is nothing scientific about ""Laughter: A Scientific Investigation""."
5,Very pretty and charming patterns,There is an error in Vanna's Afghan & Crochet Favorite Binder collection of patterns. Sampler Afghan block #46 directions are the directions for block #16. I need the pattern directions for block #46-Open Waves. Thank you
4,Brings back memories,I needed some nostalgia so I went looking for one of my favorite albums from the end of the eighties. I was in for a surprise. It was better than I remembered it. All the songs are great. This album has the best version of Rock and Roll pt.2 anywhere. I also like the addition of live tracks at the end.
4,No burnt taste,"I like it. I want my coffee hot & available without the burn from sitting on a hot plate.Pros- Keeps coffee hot without burning it (2-3 hour)Easy to operateShuts off after brew, no hot plateProgramable with clockCons- Must prep canister with hot water for coffee to stay hot for morethan an hourScrew on canister top inconvient but seals heat well"
2,Safety Hazard!,"Although it says in the specs there is no warming plate, that is WRONG! The plate is heated! I put a burn mark on my table when I took the carafe off the base and set it at our table upon my first use. It takes the carafe bottom about 5 minutes after you remove it from the base to cool enough to touch and place on unprotected surfaces.The manual (which also covers the glass version of the unit) also states no hot plate. My guess is someone in China got the wrong base units mixed up with the stainless carafe model.My guess is we will hear of a product recall soon on these.UPDATE: It's not an actual heated warming plate (w/ heat element). I took the bottom off and found that the coil that heats the water is directly under the carafe. The heat this gives off is what is getting things HOT!They should put stand off feet on the bottom of the carafe or insulate this area better. My other brand thermal carafe I have does not get hot like this one does."
1,Badly designed carafe,"Made this review to back up a prior review regarding the carafe design of this product.The carafe is literally the worst designed thermal coffee holder ever invented. I've used several others, and none of them have ever had the problems with opening/closing and pouring that this one has. I'm a big dude, nowhere close to weak, and I have to just about use a wrench to open or close it. No matter what I do with the cover, the coffee leaks and splatters when I pour it, ends up dribbling everywhere.The rest of this design is solid, but the carafe is awful. Don't buy this thing - it is unusable. I'm planning on staying away from the Mr. Coffee brand until they drink a tall glass of get right."
2,"Hard to follow, no photos of each project","I am disappointed in this book. There should be photos, not drawings. Jewelry is one of those things that just can't be captured in a drawing. The beauty is lost; so am I when trying to follow the instructions in this book. I have to turn to a different page to find information about the project I am working on and then flip back and forth to finish a project? I am not a fan. Wish I hadn't bought it. This will be a dust collector."
2,Moods in Wire,I don't care for this book. The instructions aren't very good in my opinion. I wish I hadn't bought it.
3,"Awesome projects, terrible pictures","If the author would have taken the extra expense of having photos verses drawings, I would have given this book 5 stars. The projects are awesome but the more detailed ones are hard to visualize and follow from looking at his diagrams and drawings."
3,Nice Variety of Designs,"Moods in Wire : An Extended Guide to the Fine Art of Wirewrapping (2nd Ed)I like the size of this book and like the layout. Sinclair give a good forewword with the usual basic tools and materials information then goes into the designs.Others have commented on lack of ease reading the illustrations and I'm inclined to agree. The chapters cover rings, bracelets, earrings, pendants, stickpins, shark teeth, spider pins and crosses. I liked some of the designs, didn't care for others, but that is my taste and should not deter a customer from examining this book. I feel, however, that wire jewelry is as diverse as the individual who create it, and that should be the criteria for making the purchase. If openwork is your style, then this might be the book for you."
2,Disappointment,This book only has one color insert. The rest are 8.5 x 11 b&w copies. The photo Is pretty but the instructions are weak.
3,Not Enough Content,"The book gives decent ""how to"" instructions. But, it uses drawing that appear to be free-hand. Typically, when I purchase a guide that focuses on creativity, I would prefer to see photos and better illustrations."
3,Nice To Look at,"It was ok really really good for those guys who are very new to the gay scene and dont't really have anyone to talk to about these type of issues, and not bad eye candy either althought there wasn't any full erection shots just limp but still good..."
3,It's worth buying 4 some,"The greatest part of this movie for me was the hot naked guys. I don't know how strong a motivator that is for some but if your looking for content this movie doesn't really have it, everything they stated was basically common sense and I already knew everything they had to say but I suppose if your completely new to the gay scene and your just exploring your sexuality for the first time this movie could give you some advice. I do have to say I watched it a second time a few days later when I was horny and looking for something to jerk off to."
1,Oven Mismash,THis does not work almost burned my blueberry muffins-It says wrong temperature if oven is 350 says 325-I have a top of line Bosch double oven this gadget is going back
1,Not recommended,"I had to reorder because the first one came with the indcator needle not attached.The replacement stopped working within 4-5 weeks, which is too late to return it to Amazon"
3,Not very accurate,"The good: Well built and easy to read.The bad: Poor accuracy.I had an oven that was running hot. I purchased two of these and put them next to each other in a preheated oven. One settled in at 330 degrees and the other at 350. So these thermometers are not really accurate enough for oven calibration. As others have noted, they also respond slowly, presumably because of the fully enclosed design. In all fairness, I should add that the oven control was set at 290, so resetting the oven thermostat using either thermometer will save a lot of burned cookies."
1,Broke almost immediately,"I bought this thermometer to gauge my college issued oven. It would fine the first time, but it is not at all stable, and have one foot high drop (from the top rack to the bottom rack) it never worked again. Yes its cheap, but its not worth your money unless you are an exceedingly careful person."
2,Thermostat is very inaccurate,"Tried this oven goody in several places and compared it to two other thermostats where one was analog and the other digital. The Sunbeam consistently measured some 30 degrees below the other two. The other two show identical temps.Thankfully, it was a nominal cost. But into the trash it goes."
1,Didn't Get What I Paid For,"After I realized that my Sunbeam thermometer was off 10 degrees by testing it against other more accurate thermometers, I was told by Sunbeam that this thermometer is rated to be plus or minus 15 degrees of the actual temperature. Which makes this thermometer not accurate enough for my oven."
3,Ok quality... but not the best,"Well... the sound is average... bass is not as good as I'd thought it'd be... I'm thinking its because it's not really suited for my ears...the treble is a little scruffy too... kinda ruins the mariah carey squeals....Frankly.. they are pretty much just your pair of above average earphones... nothing that will blow your mind away....Don't be mislead by the frequency range of these earphones...High school physics says that a sound of frequency below 20Hz is not sound at all but just beats... so if the headphones have a frequency range of 6Hz..its not sound at all.....just beats at 6hz a second.Also.. the average human ear can only detect sounds up to 20,000KHz.. so having a 23KHz note playing is kidna useless and can only be heard by like 5% of the human population whom are professional musicians...."
5,Awesome workout - for beginner or advanced!,"Did this workout last night -- great workout --- i was puffing by the 2nd cardio and I am pretty advanced. Loved the leg lift push-ups - great advanced move...but you can modify for beginners and then have something to do as you move up. im planning to keep doing it - it reminds me of the jillian michaels 30 day shred -- which is 3 20 min workouts (cardio, strength and abs) Awesome!"
5,My booty is so sore and I love it!,Great butt workout that incorporates the entire body! I am dripping with sweat and feel like I've done an hour workout in 30 minutes.
3,"GREAT IDEA FOR THE DVD EDITION, BUT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESTORED!","This is the kind of thing that drives me insane! They put together a pretty good idea for this release, giving us the version we all grew up with and the original Japanese version to check out. They give us trailers and a couple of short making of features. Great! right?.......WRONG! The one thing they didn't do is remaster the movies! These prints are scratched and battered! They are not horrible, but looking at the fancy packaging you would think they would have restored these prints! I can only hope that the rest of the movies in this series get better treamtments!"
5,One of the great fantasy films of all time,The original Godzilla (Gojira) is one of the great fantasy films of all time. This deluxe two disc set is a necessary addition to any serious film fans collection.
3,Not Quite There Yet,"There are some good riffs on this album, as one would expect from COC. I also enjoyed almost all of Pepper Keenan's vocals, as I usually do. But this disc lacks something that keeps it out of the 4 star range (if I could I'd give it 3 1/2 stars). Perhaps it is that the disc reminds me of mid-90's Metallica a bit too much at times, or that one of the best riffs on the album (from Paranoid) sounds almost the same as the riff from the song Bottom Feeder (on Wiseblood). Perhaps it just sounds too much like stuff I've heard too many times before. Whatever the case, while there are some pretty good southern rockish/metallish songs on the CD, and some good Sabbathesque riffs, I don't think they've gotten back to the heights they reached on Blind, Deliverance, and Wiseblood. I would say that this is a step in the right direction, though."
5,A very catchy COC album,"This album is a great heavy rock album with some strong southern rock influence. Some great songs off the album are ""Stonebreaker"", ""Paranoid Opioid"", and ""Rise River Rise. The album also has some great politically charged songs such as ""Dirty Hands Empty Pockets"", the switches between a bass, guitar, and spoken word bit to a very bluesy, southern rock riff and solo, great song. The lyrics are very dark as usual, 'rise river rise"", describes a call for a river of tears to flood a soul and clean it for judgement day. Great imagery, great riffs, bluesy solos, and rock vocals, if those interest you, give this record a spin"
4,no brush off here,The product is just as described. I would gladly buy from them again.This model tooth bush seems to run slower than the model I had before. Not a big change just different. I really don't use the slow speed.
5,Excellent !,"For the past seven years or so, have used Braun 3D Excel electric toothbrush. Finally, it started to fail recently. Decided to buy new one. Could not find it. Eventually found this - since I was convinced it was the ""handle"" that was failing, took a chance and bought this. I was in luck. It fit the charging unit perfectly and is working as good as my old one did when it was new. Very happy with my purchase and the speed of delivery."
2,"Watch out: brown is the color of these stockings, not beige.","After purchasing this product for 20 some odd years, the color has suddenly changed drastically. BEIGE IT IS NOT; MORE LIKE BROWN. I contacted Futuro and was told the product has changed color permanently. I will be buying this type of stocking from another manufacturer who's product is represented in their advertisements more accurately. Don't expect the color to be anywhere near what is represented in the image (and not just at Amazon; I've tried other merchants' sites and this is Futuro's color representation on all of them.)"
1,Smells terribly fishy when you open the bottle....,I did NOT RECEIVE the same product as posted! It was not a Member's Mark product and it came in a clear bottle. I had already returned the same kind to Sam's Club. It came in a clear bottle not the white one..... Sam's Club changed companies for it's fish oil and I will NOT buy it there again.
5,Lawn Buddy,"The Ames True Temper Lawn Buddy is one of the best. I have been using one for years. If you garden and have back problems (most gardeners do) then this is a great help. Also, your tools are right there in the cart."
5,Just As Advertised,"Sturdy and roomy, this gardening seat does exactly what it advertises. I've used many other flimsier versions; this is the best I've seen for the money."
3,no tool rack,"the cart arrived without the tool rack, as shown in green sitting in top of the cart. I would like to know why?"
1,"Junk, junk, junk!","I'll admit it- I was thinking that this probably wasn't a good call when I bought it. But my daughter really, really wanted it for her birthday- in fact, it was the only thing she wanted! So, I bought it. It is VERY hard to use correctly- you need to sit the mini Barbies JUST SO at a certain distance on the ""template leaf"" (direct quote). The, half the time, it doesn't work anyway, or the doll falls off, or the trunk falls off the elephant. Most of the time, our elephant sits with his trunk fallen off. Sad, and a waste. If your child really loves it, buy the mini version- it doesn't throw the dolls around, but it's cheaper and works better (it rolls.)"
2,A popup,"I am very interested in and knowledgeable about baseball history. I like the idea of comparing players of different eras to each other. For example, how would dead ball slugger Homerun Baker compare to Babe Ruth and on to Barry Bonds? This book gives us an answer, and to some degree it seems valid. I wouldn't have used the particular methods that this author did, but I do agree that Ruth's homerun accomplishments were superior to Bonds's in this age of swatting souped up golf balls over the fence. But the fictional recreation of imaginary playoffs seemed like a bad idea, particularly since the author inserted a random chance factor in his results. Why? Why should a reader care what random results were arrived at? The book didn't hold my interest, though I think the premise isn't bad."
4,"Pretty good, but not perfect.","The bass on these headphones are actually quite good except that you have to push them in the ears so that the acoustic plus feature seals up the ear canal. If the headphones are not inserted properly there won't be much bass at all. The overall sound quality is pretty good, but I think the high end portable sony headphones have a better upper end clarity. The only real problem with the headphones is that they can become quite uncomfortable because they create some pressure within the ear canal when the acoustic plus seals it up. However at least you can wear glasses with these things because the swoops band goes under the ears and not over so that is a plus."
3,vcr short shows,received first one was in bad shape. replaced it and got another one was in better shap but still had flaws in the screen while watching. between the two i was able to watch all 3 complete shows.
4,Speedy!,This compact flash card worked great for the rapid shots (3 frames per second) I love to take on my Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera.Edit info: Once again I forgot to select the number of stars for my rating. and therefore saved the Amazon default star rating. I give this product a FIVE star rating.
3,READ CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY IT,"The pantyhose are too tight , I can feel my circulation its not good with this pantyhose, I didin't read the description very well and this is no the type of pantyhose I was looking for. If you have very very extreme problems with your legs this are the ones for you, ut if you are looking for a medium compress pantyhose you will feel these will strangle your legs ."
3,waist too tight,"For a product aimed at middle aged women and beyond, the waist is way too tight (for my 29 inch waist in size M). I've used support hose for almost 40 years and haven't found a better pair of hose yet, especially for the price. I've never tried the hundred dollar range hose. Previous versions (circa 2000-2005 perhaps) have used a softer waistband, with material more like the rest of the hose fabric, and integrated into the fabric. This new version has hard elastic sewn on. I sew, so I'll probably cut the band and insert more elastic, not an attractive choice, but probably my only one, since I haven't found a better source or product. The toes on these hose are roomy, but not too roomy, an improvement over the earlier product and the heavy duty compression is great, as always."
1,Kind of pointless when you can get the advanced AV pack,"When I first got my xbox I picked up the advanced AV pack immediately to get the Dolby 5.1 experience, I must say, that was great! I picked this up after getting an HDTV, but I was extremely disappointed. The xbox supports a widescreen format with the traditional hookups so that didn't change a thing, and the graphics on xbox are so old school already that you're not going to notice the details like blades of grass, facial hair, etc. that you notice with regular HDTV signals. On top of that, only half of the games I own even have HDTV capabilities, and of those, 95% (including Halo 2) have a max resolution of 480P, which can be sent through a regular s-video signal.In conclusion, I would say that the 5.1 surround sound feature is great, but if you want to play games in HD, get a PS3, wii, or 360. If you still have an xbox, you are probably trying to save money, so get the advanced AV pack for the 5.1 sound and s-video output."
2,Low quality,"Very fast shipment, so I do appreciate that. But the product was very low quality. The material is scratchy and chintzy. Also, I did not believe it was true-to-size. I ordered a queen size, and it was too small. I am a size 22. It looked like it would fit between a 12-16."
1,"Are you crazy, nobody in their right mind would pay this price.","I have checked many sights for prices and at the most,it costs $70.00.You don't even say wether it's 3 or 4 inch pipe. You don't even offer free shipping. You people are crooks,in my opinion. no wonder you don't have any reviews on this item, and I'll bet you won't allow this one.I've rated this item at one, but it does'n even deserve to be rated."
4,Cables to Go,"Quick service, product was actually delivered before the promised date (was on backorder). Very nice tool selection."
4,Covers the Flash essentials,"I just completed my Certified Flash MX 2004 developer exam, and after purchasing this book to swat up on my knowledge I found it quite helpful.Some of the questions in the exam were pretty hard and while I just failed, I think this was more due to my lack of knowledge (about Flash) and not enough prep time, rather than the book.After reviewing the book (after the exam) I found that most of the topics in the exam were all ""broadly"" covered by the book (as they should be), and if i'd actually taken time to read the book more thoroughly I think I would have definitely passed.While the review questions at the end each chapter are pretty easy, they're really only there to test your comprehension of the chapter you've just read.My only criticism is that the exam pass mark should be 65% instead of 70%. Because my mark of 66% would have seen me pass ;)"
1,Unsatisfactory Product,"Don't get misled by the product description and title. It's different from what you get at Walgreens. This product is of inferior quality, very tight and not worth the price. I bought it from here and then returned it. Thankfully I got entire money refunded"
1,Not worth the money,"This book looks like it would be exciting, but the recipes are utterly boring and can be found all over the internet for free. There is nothing really original about it, and I had imagined that if an author touts about haveing low-fat recipes, they would actually provide nutritional information."
5,Now THIS is outstanding!,"Hoses don't last long for me. At least, they haven't of late. I partly blame myself for not storing them properly, I partly blame where we decided to store the hose, and I partly blame the hoses we've bought for kinking so easily.This one looks like it will solve our problems. First off, $50 for this is a heck of a bargain. It's a good hose with a very capable reel, and about 4' of connecting hose you can run to the spigot. It connects to the spigot via a quick release valve, which both makes it a cinch to hook up, and easy to move around if you have extra quick-releases.The reel mechanism is solid, and I have no complaints so far. Time will tell, but I feel pretty good about this one. It may just last us more than one year this time!"
1,Leaking,"I like the design of this product, light, very portable. But it started to leak at the first time I tried it...Water came out from the inner connection between the hose and the base. No matter how I tried to reconnect it, it still leaked. The included hose had a nice brass connector, but the one on the base was black plastic, which looked very cheap. Also the position of that connector was very difficult to access. I wished the front pad could be dissembled easily so that I could put some tape there to fix the problem.Anyway, I am trying to return it and looking for another good hose reel."
4,65-food cassette hose king reel,This is a good product because it is easy to use and the hose stores easily. It is much easier to use than the regular watering hoses.
5,A very good book,"I bought this book around 1998. It was the only book that coverCGI and C, the rest talked about PERL which I hadnt learned yet.Once the reader learns the basics (assuming they already know 1 of the 2 languages and have a webserver to play with), they should be able to construct any CGI program in almost any language."
2,"A ""No No,"" for first-timers","This book may be good if you are an experienced user of C, or Perl, but for someone like me, a new user, this book is way over your head. The book starts off nice and slow, but once you get into the actual ""useful"" portion of the book, you are totally lost.I would not recommend this book to anyone who is trying to learn CGI programming from scratch, it assumes that you already know a fair amount about both C and Perl."
3,The briefbits of grim reality spoil an incredibly wacky and delightfully unbelievable yarn,"I was all setto give this five stars in spite of the plot's cheerful implausibility and mounting of impossible coincidences. I can appreciate over-the-top screwball humor. However, one of the bad guys turns out to be too close to real life sickos to belong in this book's wackily fantastic universe where all that can go wrong does. I don't really want to scare readers away from this, but I do want to warn of possibly quite disturbing feelings during the last couple of chapters."
1,Life's too short to waste on this one,"I started looking at the page numbers hoping I was almost through about 1/3 in. If only I had stopped there.If you want whacky, uplifting AND funny stick with Christopher Moore or Tom Robbins. This is mostly just annoying as hell."
1,Nope . . . a miss,"Read No Time for Goodbye,which wasn't bad. Bought Bad Move plus three others like it on the strength of the enjoyable previous read. Knew from the first chapter it was not for me. Seemed amature-ish, boring & totally uninteresting so don't want to waste any more time with further escapades of Zach et al. Unfortunatley, all books are in the ""take to second hand bookstore"" bag. Waste of money."
4,Sound Christian Informed Thought about Culture & Christ,"Solid collection of essays in honor of Carl F. Henry. They address the church of Christ in its cultural setting, with facets on law, literature, art, history, media, science, environment, bioethics, etc.Scholars such as D.A. Carson, Geoffrey Bromiley, Edmund Clowney, etc., all contribute well in an academia minded way.Of particular interest and enlightenment was the very well done essays by Spitz on ""The Historian and the Ancient of Days"" as well as ""Phillp Johnson's ""Modernist Impasse in Law.""Some revolve around classic Niebuhr's grid while others burn new cultural analysis paths.Good read and reference."
4,On Carl F.H. Henry,"Carl F.H. Henry was the most important theologian from the contemporary Evangelical (formerly called Neo-Evangelical) movement in America. He had a depth that many departed from, in the 1960s, with a narrower worldview and whose contemporaries are somewhat naive. For his greatness, he was vastly misunderstood or opposed. Read his primary writings like God, Revelation and Authority. This festschrift has some informative writings.In general, I would agree with Rodboomboom's assessment. Much of the writings need to tie Dr. Henry's thought more in with their subject matter. Also, read Kevin Vanhoozer's and Leland Ryken's writings. Kenneth Kantzer's ""Appreciation"" is more personal.His groundbreaking book was ""The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism,"" which is back in print.He passed away on December 7, 2003."
1,I did not like these at all,I got the black and they were not at all what I expected or wanted. The leather was very rough like sand paper with a gray cast to it. They could not be polished because of the way the leather was. They did run small and were very stiff and uncomfortable. They just did not look like good quality boots. The seams and edges of the leather and the sole were very rough and uneven. Definitely not what I would have expected with the regular price being what it was. I got them on clearance and was glad I was able to return them with no problems.
1,When people dont know their place,"Dont get it twisted Heather Hunter is not a rapper she is a piss poor imitation of one. But if you had to consider her as a rapper then HH is the worst female rapper since Kevin Federline (lol!). The only postive side of the side of this album is the the beats provided by Scott Storch, DJ Premier and Aaron Freedom Lyles. HH couldnt rap her way out of a wet paper bag but Im pretty sure she could f--k her way out one easily! She couldnt rap on beat to save her life and guest appearances by Mister Cee and Akinyele make you lose any respect you had for these two. HH needs to stick to porn and leave rap to the experts!"
1,Skip this one - $700 in the toilet,"Bought the Elura 70 the moment it was available, paid $700. Used it may 3-4 hours, got it out for the kid's birthday, started having problems with the tape stopping, now it will not accept any tape, constant ""eject Cassette"" error. 14th month and out of warranty. Seach the internet, you'll find this problem everywhere. $174 minimum to repair, probably/possibly more(with shipping/insurance $200 easily). Oh, and then you get a lovely 3 month warranty after the repair and you cannot purchase a longer warranty from the repair. A minimum of $200 and I get 3 months coverage on $700 unit? Thanks, I'll use that $200 to purchase a quality product instead."
1,Two thumbs down!,I am a huge fan of canon and thought they would be reliable with their camcorders as well. This camera lasted for about 1 year... about 10 tapes. Im having the same problems as other users where the tape got caught. I also have problems where the cam zooms by itself with the zoom button internally stuck.Will cost me 180 to send in. Abosulutely insaine. Stay away from this one and consider something different than Canon.
5,MSM is truly a miracle for pain relief!,"Dr. Jacob and Dr. Lawrence have provided laymen with a resource that is easy to understand and full of information about our body's processes. I am a 55 year old female suffering from severe osteoarthritis pain from a ski-related injury 15 years ago. I was considering having surgery to alleviate the pain, but heard about MSM from a friend, and then found this book which gave me the facts I needed. After only one week of taking the crystals (5 grams per day), my pain was almost eliminated. I have continued taking MSM for two months now, increased to 8 grams per day with 1500mg of glucosamine sulfate daily, and have reduced my use of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) to 1 per day from 3. I hope to completely eliminate the NSAID soon. My range of motion has improved so much that I am able to ride my horse in the mountains, climb stairs, jog, etc., all without pain! Thanks for the miracle!"
4,Very good.,"This book was very helpfull for my studies. It's very good for teachers, students and journalists. I liked it a lot. In Brazil, we don't have a book that describes a radiodrama production."
4,Body Glove Snap Fins,"Having ordered Body Glove Snap fins as a present, I had expected to wait atleast 2wks for the order to arrive as it was coming from an independent vender. I received the fins in 5 days. Great service."
2,not very sturdy,"Easy to assemble, but it is definitely not sturdy at all. If I would have had a chance to look at this stand in person, I would have never bought it. Even on tile flooring it's wobbly."
1,Clearly a defective unit,"I have owned it for 3 years and 4 months. Within the first two months, we had to return it for service because it didn't have any picture. I was told the whole lense assembly needed to be replaced. Now it has an eject tape error and the tape won't eject. It makes grinding noises. It has been well cared for. People who give it good reviews haven't owned it very long"
4,Great Purchase,This was a very good buy. Its definitely worth the money. You can get some good exercise out of it once you put your mind to it.
3,Edge 500 Manual Treadmill Review,"The Edge 500 Manual Treadmill is a good value for those interested in a basic treadmill. It assembled easily and doesn't occupy much space. However, the belt often sticks while you are walking throwing your pace off. I purchased this item for my wife since I belong to a health club where the tredmills are electric and provide a constant pace."
1,Very Hard to Use!!,I bought this machine because I'm pregnant and I needed a safe alternative to the dangers of walking outside and walking in the heat this summer. The product description fails to mention that the inclines are both very steep. I can't even stay on this treadmill without hanging on to the rails for dear life!! As soon as I start walking I feel like I need to run to keep up with the machine. This was a total waste of money.
4,nice!,"the product is very good! i just didn't know that the product comes in one piece. Other than that, it arrived on time and was useful for me. Thanks!"
4,"great flick, suckee dvd","Why do American versions of British flicks have to be edited with a machete? What is up with that? Amanda Price singing-- snip. All of a sudden, Whickam is there-- where did he come from? Frickin' ridiculous."
4,Fun for Austen fans,"A creative and unique twist on Austen. Die hard Austen fans might not care for this, but I thought it was good fun."
3,i guess i'm a romantic at heart...,"The series had such promise. I expected honestly, so much more. I gave it three stars for the fascinating scenery, and the costumes. BYt i mean I love Jane Austen, and if this girl was such a great lover of Pride and Prejudice why did she act so rude and out of place. She should have known how to behave, what to expect from Darcy. Instead, she gave the impression that she did not know any of those people, or who they were."
3,For Austen fans only,"An entertaining, if slightly improbable story, that centers on a young women's obsession with Jane Austen's book characters. This movie is best suited for those who have actually read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or seen one of the movies based on it. While the actors did a good job in their roles, the storyline was a bit far-fetched and hard to follow at times, even for an Austen enthusiast. A definite plus was the beautiful countryside where the movie was filmed."
5,A Fun Twist for the Jane Austen Fan,"I was delighted to discover Lost in Austen. This twist on BBC's interpretation of Jane Austen's masterpiece is a sweet surprise for any Austen lover. It is best appreciated if the viewer is first a fan of the book and BBC's epic starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I say this with respect, as I count myself among their ranks: This may disappoint, or even irk, literature snobs. I, however, love the satire and fully believe it's in the spirit of Austen herself, who has long been celebrated for her cunning and biting wit. This is a new favorite!"
5,Lost in Austen,"I have every Austen film in my dvd library. This one is a very different take, but it is very enjoyable. Loved it and the main actress did a fine job. put it on your list to watch."
2,Wished I Had Liked It,"I am sorry to say that I could not like this movie. This had nothing to do with the plot, it was all about the characters. None of the characters seemed charming or to have that spark of life to them that makes us enjoy all the characters of Pride and Prejudice even while knowing all of their faults. Besides, if at the end of the movie you like Wickham more then Mr. Darcy...something is deeply wrong. Seriously, I questioned my nature as a female when I had this epiphany. Amanda is...I don't know, a bit clumsy and bland; and I think I have enough respect for us women that most of us who have read Pride and Prejudice would have done better then her in this situation. Either way, the characters are not Austen's, they seem more like the directors slightly ridiculous caricatures. All that being said, its probably worth seeing once if you're an enthusiast. However, I recommend that you rent it. Buy it after you know you like it for sure or not."
5,Hilarious tongue in cheek Austen adaptation,"This retelling of Pride and Prejudice takes us where no other Austen adaptation has gone before. Modern London singleton Amanda Price has been dreaming of Mr. Darcy her whole life and when Elizabeth Bennet shows up in Amanda's bathroom wanting to switch places, Amanda is ready to accept. However, once inside the story, things don't go exactly as Jane Austen planned! The results of Amanda's interference are both funny and heartbreaking. . I don't think this show is meant to be taken seriously as a period piece. It seems to be more tongue in cheek with many inside jokes for lovers of all things Jane Austen. If you try to take this as a direct adaptation or a strict period piece you will be disapointed. I'm a Janeite and a huge fan of the novel and the Colin Firth version and I really enjoyed this production. I think even Jane Austen, if she lived today, would be laughing along"
4,Wishing I was Lost in Austen,"Who hasn't ever wished they were one of the characters in their favorite book!!! I thought the movie was great, lots of twists and turns. I definitely recommend this for any Austen fan."
1,Tacky!!,I was so disappointed by this crude movie!! I love Jane Austen and this movie had what sounded like a fun plot but was awful. Very offensive and hated the ending. Best advice: don't watch it!!
5,If you love Austen...,"Great, great fun! If you know the story of Austen's Pride and Prejudice it is fun to watch as it becomes unraveled. I must admit to some angry moments, but trust me, it all comes right in the end. This movie is perfect for a movie party, keeping in mind that it is 3 hours long. It might even be fun to watch a more serious version of Pride and Prejudice first just to lay the groundwork. The Colin Firth version would be perfect, as it is referenced in this movie, but it is also quite lengthy."
4,Viking Warrior,The story was enjoyable to read and the only weakness was the lack of sustantive historical references. The book was good value for the price.
5,The best book i'v ever read!,"I read a lot of books and this one is by far the best. Not only is it gripping but it shows you what's it like to be a viking and is piled high with facts about the viking life. So whether you like action,facts, or adventure this is a must read!!"
2,Very shallow,"I have read all of Con Iggulden's books, so Amazon recommended this one. I gave up on it about 1/4 of the way through because I just wasn't interested in it. It seemed shallow and formal and the characters wooden."
4,If you get past the beginnig its Great,"This book was pretty boring in the beginning but as it went on it got better and better. In the beginning nothing happens and there's tons and tons of filler, but later it gets interesting. There is still lots of filler throughout the book but it gets more and more exciting. He does a good job of geting you hooked at the end and then leaving you there. If you can manage around 100 pages of boredom you will get rewarded with tons of exciting and interesting stuff.I wouldn't say this book is for everyone though I could see lots of people i know loving the beginning and hating the rest or just hating evrything together. I think its a great book so you should try it and if its not right for you try a difrent book.If you do buy this book i suggest you by the second one too and if you like the first one at the end get the third one. I made the mistake buying one at a time and believe me the ends are Gigantic cliff hangers so you will want the next ones."
4,"Enjoyable, but not entirely accurate","I really enjoyed this production, but since I have read Little Women many, many times, I noticed many inaccuracies in the story line and the quotes. I suppose this helped the story since it needed to be abridged, but it kind of bothered me. The voices and sound effects were very good, I liked Laurie the best:) Over all, it was an enjoyable production."
2,Doesn't work well with my Samsung A460,The earbug is very uncomfortable and it keeps slipping out. I have a difficult time hearing the other side. The only time the other side can hear me well is when I hold the microphone very close to my mouth.
4,Great A/C,"I have used this A/C for one year, and I love it. If there is too much humidity, then the A/C will turn off. After I emptied the water tray; it works perfectly. I have had to empty the water about four times over the last year, so it is a great product!"
2,It Lays There Looking Bad and Burping As It Eats Batteries Faster Than You Can Recharge Them!,"As previous reviews note, the display is small and has an annoyingly narrow angle of view -- you have to look at it head-on to read it. That might not be so bad except that in only lays flat, requiring you to look directly down at it. It would be worth a few extra bucks if you could stand it up. In addition, it runs on three AAA batteries, which don't power it for long. Using new, top of the line rechargeables, I have to replace the batteries about every two days."
4,Yep it's a caller ID box,"Yep it's a caller ID box, and it keeps track of incoming phone numbers. ok, stop pestering me to review this thing."
3,A good book to take on vacation,"This is the first book of the series that I have read. I found it thoroughly enjoyable. The dynamics between four very different sisters on vacation were very well drawn. The characters are very real, the mystery interesting, and I found myself laughing at the situations the characters found themselves in at points."
1,very disapointed,This piece is beautiful however it is not well made. I was surprised at the strength of the chain. It is thin but strong. The tiny stones fall out of the setting and are lost very easily and the hinge is very weak. I would not recommend this product despite it's beauty.
3,Had potential,"Although the recommended age for this toy is 4 years old, I still bought it for my 3 year old. I thought my husband or I would end up building stuff for him anyways and to see something build from scratch would be interesting and a good learning experience for my toddler. But when we started building one of the many illustrated examples, both my husband and I were stumped. Many pieces simply didn't fit and other parts started breaking. If only the quality was much better and more durable, I'm sure the toy would be something worth passing down to my younger kids."
3,disappointment,"I expected this to be a detailed presentation on how Auschwitz worked. Instead it was all over the place, with large portions talking about Sobibor; human interest stories; and how Jews were transported from Denmark, Slovakia, and France. This book should have focused on Auschwitz."
2,Works great but doesn't last long,"In the past three years I've had two of these phones. They both worked as advertised, and the speaker works very well. However, about a year ago the first one died (nothing but static on the line, eventually giving the ""phone off the hook"" noise even with the handset hung up, none of the other phones would work while it was plugged in). And just this week, the second one died. Maybe I expect too much, but I want my phone to last more than a couple of years."
3,Not bad a phone for the price,"This phone solved the simple speakerphone-lessness problem and solved it decently. Well, actually I would say for the price, its difficult to expect more than this quality.Sound quality is fine, audible enough. But the product is not ergonomically designed. After a while if you are holding the earpiece, it hurts and maybe they want you to use the speaker phone feature and appreciate it.If you are hunting for a cheap phone with speaker phone facility only, then go for it."
5,Demo was awesome,"This game looks really sweet, i havent played strategy games in a while because i lost interest in them, but this is one that i just cant miss, i downloaded the demo because it looked cool, and after i played i kinda sat in my chair stunned. if you have a fast connection i definetely reccomend you download the demo and see for yourself, or if not just buy the game when it comes out"
4,Really nice graphics and cinematic clips,"This game has the best cinematic clips I have ever seen on a PC game. It comes close to the CGI movie Final Fantasy The Spirits Within. The game graphics are also superb with fantastic detail.The gameplay is the same as the first one with the player going up against enemy units and given various scenarios to complete. One big gripe I have though is that though there are three different factions in this game, only 2 are actually playable. The third faction, The Terrans only exist as the computer enemy which is too bad because it has some really cool units including walker strider units. Perhaps Massive will launch a expansion pack that will enable the player to play as the Terrans. Overall I rate the graphics a 10, the gameplay a 7, the sound a 8, and the storyline a 7."
2,Ok book,This book didn't really provide any information that wasn't easily accessible online. This would be a good book for someone with no ebay knowledge.
2,Not leather!!!,"I was very disappointed when I got these and realized they are not real leather or suede. The description says ""constructed of leather"", so I assumed they were. ( should have known the price was too good) Anyways they are very cute and seem very comfy, but I think I'm sending them back."
3,ALL DIGITAL,G.E. has pretty much outdone theirselves this time..this messaging system is not commonly used everyday by most...
1,Buy another machine,"I purchased this machine less than a year ago and it is terrible. The sound quality of the digital messages is poor at best. You have to listen to a message several times to be able to understand what someone is saying. Also, after 6 months the LCD light stopped working, and now it has stopped answering all together. Do yourself a favor and buy another machine."
3,a very collective work,"Look; the critics know what Steve was goin through at the time. I know one thing ... My kids sing along to every song on that CD,and they as well as I love the music! Look Steve has had demons to calm but don't we all? What he went through was all his and I'll give u mine ! Steve dosen't write for critics who'll be un heard of long before his music has past!"
4,listen to it while doing the dishes...,"glitch. the world between 0 and 1 is great, but mankind isn't wholly there yet. When I'm not up to the task of absorbing this beautiful sonic intensity head on, then it's gotta be while i'm clanking plates around in the sink underneath a backdrop of rushing water, to soothe the potential headaches that prolonged glitch-exposure are bound to bring.Otherwise its good. interesting, quirky. sometimes challenging."
2,DBZ Collection,"Dragonball Z:Movie pack Collection, discs were scratched and had finger prints, not allowing me to watch after opening, forcing me to take them to be cleaned professionaly."
2,received different product,"I received a different product called ""Soothing Protective Powder"". NOT the ""Antiseptic First-Aid Powder"" that was in the listing photo."
2,What a bummer !,"Well I loved both 1 and 2 and I was so excited when I heard this was out . I bought it and finished it in 10 hours of playing time . What a huge dissapointment , it comes in a 2 cd case but only has 1 cd in it . I really thought it would be harder but it was really easy . I owned it less then 24 hours and finished it . Big bummer SONY , this is not worth the price"
1,Who designed the graphics for this game ?,I have played Syphon Filter 2 and I thought the graphics were ok but Syphon Filter 3 was horrible.If Sony (Hey what do you know they make the Playstation 2!)doesn't make the 4th version for Playstation 2 and use the power of it I won't buy it.
1,disposable phone,"If you want a disposable phone, then buy this one. After owning this phone for less then a year, the 3-6-9 number keys stopped working. When I contacted GE's customer service to replace or to repair the phone, because it was still under warranty, they would not. Not a good telephone, even worse customer service."
2,Don't buy this phone,"It's not worth the money. The Called ID doesn't tell you which line is calling. The phone connection is cheap. It's difficult to turn on the speakerphone -- you press the button and nothing happens. Basically, this is a cheap, poorly made product that I regret buying.Don't make the same mistake."
1,Very dry and uninsightful,I found the book to be of little value to the hardcore investor. The subject matter itself could have been handled in a more easily understandable fashion. There seemed to be an aire of condesention throughout the entire work.
2,"Great Design, weak quality control","The umbrella is well thought out and big. But, the handle was installed on the shaft too far up. The keeper ring does not have enough space to slide down and then back up to secure the ends of the ribs. The two straps with velcro hold the umbrella closed, but the sliding ring is useless. Hope you get one from a better manufacturing run."
2,Ordered 2 and both broke right away.,"I would advise against ordering this umbrella. I ordered two and one broker right away. As soon as we opened it, the thread holding the second layer on broke so I returned that one. Then, after about 2 uses of the other one, the same thing happened. It still seems to be functional but its just the principal that it shouldn't break that easily. It is inexpensive and the rest of the quality seems decent. It is HUGE too. I think I would have returned mine even if it hadn't broke because I didn't want one that bug but it is a good size for my boyfriend so we kept his."
1,No picture protection,"Silver Filigree Marcasite Genuine Amethyst Cross LocketThe cutouts offer NO protection to the 2 pictures I would like to put in it. A locket after all is meant to be worn for years AND protect the contents. The locket is essentially an open picture frame and rain or humidity will ruin my pics. Please mention this feature IN the ad. I had no Christmas present for my daughter, paid shipping and now have to pay shipping back.The marcasite elements are SO minute that the piece has no dazzle which marcasite has a reputation for.Spring clasp on chain sticks open, does not open all the way; too undependable."
2,;-(,"I liked the necklace but teethe hinge is loose and makes it crooked, which makes it look cheap, disappointing! My Luke this holiday season was notgood"
1,junk,"My wired teen who I got this for tells me - This controller is terrible, look elsewhere.If you're looking for a junky controller to let your guest play on then get this, other than that, the joysticks are actually sharp and will hurt after a few minutes of play, the joysticks stick and my controller has a bias after a month. The buttons do not always work and if they do, they stick occasionally, this is not a very responsive controller and has a tendency to ignore button pushing unless you hammer the button down, the thumbsticks are also very SMALL, I know they look big in the pic but they're tiny, you slip off them and it's REALLY hard to push them in to crouch or use the scope or whatever. Good battery life but hey, if it doesn't work half the time, who cares how long that time is. Get a better one, the standard controller is superior to this one."
3,This cd has already become one of my favorites,"It's funny how sometimes things just happen. In the case of this cd I just stumbled on to it. By all means i'm not sorry for this stumble. It has turned out to be one of my many cherished treasures.The music on this cd is just grand. The song selection and band seem to be made for each other. They fit together so nicely. I would like to purchase more of this product when it becomes available. WITH LOVE AND MUSIC, PHILIP SCOTT"
1,dont waste your money,I can say I am a fan as I have all their CD and VHS but this DVD is terrible. Everything is sloppy especially Rick Ocasek perfomance.Very unprofessional and cannot be compared to CD. The song's choice is not the best either. As Rick was chewing something between singing I had impression it was main part for him. Brrrr...
4,A rare gem,A fun and fascinating video ...There are more and more '60s and '70s concert videos hitting the market and much of it has crappy audio quality - by today's standards. But what do you expect?! The great thing about this Cars DVD is you can imagine seeing these guys in a small nightclub in 1979. You see that the talented musicianship and quirky-catchy songwriting was there early in the band's career. The fascinating reunion interview provides some useful insights on how they all came together and worked creatively.I saw The Cars at the SF Cow Palace after their second album and they were polished to a sheen by then. This 1979 video shows they were far from a creation of the studio. - Paul Harrar
2,Inferior to our old speakerphone,We tried to replace our old speakerphone with a newer model. This one has a very soft speaker volume and makes loud noises if you get too close to the speaker. I like the old version better.
1,Where's the speakerphone?,"After four or five days, the speakerphone volume would suddenly grow faint and we could not hear our caller nor adjust the volume, so we returned the phone."
1,Wacko phone is the pits,"My wife purchased this phone in a pinch thinking that GE is a good name in electronic products. The only reliable feature left on this phone is that we can dial a phone number and receive phone calls. We are not always guaranteed a clear transmission due to transient clicks, radio singnals, music, and static from outer space. I have never been able to leave a phone message because it says it is always full. Why havewe keep it? God only knows. Our faith has waned anf we will purcahse a new phone."
3,nice but,"Has all of the required features -- answering machine, speaker phone, caller id, and corded phone. But ringer does not ring if power goes out (defeats the purpose of the corded phone) and volume on answering machine does not mute (defeating the purpose of the answering machine if attempting some sort of privacy in a household)."
2,Lousy Speaker Phone but ok otherwise,"I bought this phone because I wanted an inexpensive SpeakerPhone and guess what I got? A cheap unusable SpeakerPhone. The rest of the telephone seems to work ok, good contrast adjustment, Caller ID seems to work ok, voice clarity is ok. If you want a SpeakerPhone this one is not for you, if you want a decent corded Caller ID phone then it might work for you."
5,Wolf Brother review,"Wolf Brother's genre is fiction. The theme is serious. the setting takes place in a forest. The conflict in this book is about a hard mission. The mission is to go to a mountain, but to go there... it isn't easy. Afterwards, in my opinion, this book is kind of intresting but I accually didn't like it that much."
1,Yer Mom,"This book sucks. I read this book in class and it made me fall asleep because nobody cared about this cancer girl. It is very confusing because it kept repeating details about the character, Bluish. It didn't stay on topic. It's so corny. Virginia Hamilton--her books are boring. I couldn't connect to this book mentally. This book shouldn't even get one star."
1,Bluish,"Bluish is the story of a young girl, Dreenie who lives in New York City. She lives with an annoying little sister and an almost more annoying best friend, Tuli. The book tells the story of these three girls befriending a girl at school who no one likes. The kids call her Bluish. She sits alone in a wheelchair when she comes to school and talks to no one. she has no hair. Only hats. And she is so sickly pale her skin has a blue tint. At first the girls fear her but through the story they accept her as one of their own.This book Virginia Hamilton is written very choppy. It jumps around a lot and doesn't stick to one theme. It is very repetitive and at times I even thought I was rereading a page. i would not reccommend this book."
2,This is just one hose,"Title says ""1-Pack"" but looking to see what's included in the 'Pack' is says ""2 Per Package"" so I bought it only to get one. Had to return it to get the 2-pack. Confusing."
3,"""Another one of those BOOGIE DOWN BRONX classics!""","This under-ground classic, contains some of the hottest MC's, DJ's and producers in Hip-Hop. From DJ Jazzy Jay (of ""THE ALL MIGHTY ZULU NATION""), Tony-D, DJ Grand Wizard Theodore, The Ultimate Force (feat. a young Diamond D pre D.I.T.C.) and many more that were rocking through out the '80's and early '90's. Just listening to the Diamond D produced ""I'm the King"" (a song that was obviously ghost-written by Lord Finesse) will make it worth owning this CD. Every thing on this CD has that old skool, Bronx '88-'89 flavor. I can't even front on the classic ""I'm not playing"", by the Ultimate Force"" ( Diamond D & Master Rob). Cop this now, before others catch wind of this classic and the price quadruples! --NOTE-- 5 stars, not 3."
5,Enough for a family,"This was a great buy! I filled up each popcorn tub with a dvd, movie theatre candies and wrapped them in cellophane for Christmas gifts! they were a hit and a great family gift!"
2,Life is life is crap is crap..,Once upon a time in the glow colorfull of 80's when we where young and naive about what music is good or bad .. yes lovely simplicity.. We all enjoyed this .. song?. . well but we overcome to all that and belive me it is enough the pain guilt just to listen at radio to dare buy a whole CD with 2 dam versions of the same lalalarala.. life is life.. lalarala believe me the strophes in the middle are just to avoid cut and paste more times the same life is life.. well life is lies.. or life is bra or life is crap .. it's the same.. for God sake!stop it...If you want to laugh about your partent's music BUY THEM this and enjoy seem them blush..
1,Fine until it died...,"This phone works great...to a point. However, less than 8 weeks after we started using the phone, the Caller ID went out. The only way to get it to work was to unplug the phone and plug it back in, and not only did that mess up the time signature, it only works for a couple of hours before the phone displays ""no data"" again. GE Customer Support was completely unhelpful, as this phone is manufactured by Thomson, and they would do nothing on our behalf. Thomson will not exchange the phone without us sending it back in to them and waiting six weeks for a returned phone. Thomson has no customer support for this phone and its phone line is merely an automated system. This is inexcusable - I need a phone that works properly! It is great if you get a working one, admittedly...but if you don't, expect a long wait. (And Office Depot, who sells the phone, offers their own product replacement, but it has to be out of manufacturer warranty. So we're still hosed.)"
1,not a keeper,"I thought I had found a real value with this combination phone that boasted all the features I was looking for. However; the handset, which was to be the primary phone used, proved to be worthless. The only way to get clear reception was to be in the same room as the base (how's that for defeating the purpose?) and the caller ID came up with an 'error' all too frequently. Four days after purchasing this phone, I dumped it and got a Panasonic which I'm quite happy with."
3,GE 26930GE1 - looks nice but sound quality poor,Perhaps I need to avoid phones with volume controls... But at the lowest level the quality is good but not loud enough. As the volume is increased the background noise begins to be annoying. Strange how I replaced an old phone that just fell apart with the latest and greatest to be so disappointed.
3,"Good picture, inexpensive, bad company.","I purchased this TV because I liked the picture quality and the price. It is less expensive than others with the same picture quality. However it is true, you get what you pay for. It seems this TV has some manufacturing issues. The first TV that Amazon sent would not turn on. I called Toshiba, hoping they would simply fix it, and discovered what a poor company they are. First they refused to immediately fix the TV. They explained they needed to ensure it was a new TV and under warranty.. even though it is a 2001 model? Wow. This process was going to take a couple of weeks and require hours of waiting to speak to someone at Toshiba.So... I used Amazon's online return. Luckly Amazon understands the concept of customer service and immediatly sent a new TV.The new TV has a good picture (after it warmed up a couple of hours). I only hope it holds up."
3,confusing to the beginner,"way to much money and was not very helpful to the beginner, like me, in collecting Heisey glass- confusing"
1,Waste of Money,This item is not conpatible with Windows 7. Microsoft has not approved drivers for it. This fact is not advertised with the product. Contacting Belkins Customer Service is a waste of time unless you know a lot of foriegn languages.
4,Does the job with XP Drivers,"I have an older XP-Pro PC running on a Pentium 4 / 3.0 Mhz. Upon running the Belkin software and plugging the device in all looked promising; I entered my WEP key and it was accepted; then I received repeated messages that the network server would not communicate with my computer. As suggested in several reviews, I went into the Belkin utility and flagged the option to run on Windows' Utility...and now it works great at 54.0 mbps in a bedroom upstairs from my router. Uninstalling the Belkin software and running the Windows Add New Hardware Wizard made it work faster/better with fewer icons/distractions. So if your PC is XP-based bypass the Belkin software and go straight for the Windows new hardware installation and you should have a good experience with this product."
1,Didn't work and company would not give refund!,"When I received the item it looked brand new so I figured that it must work. However, after installing the software and trying to use it, I could not get wireless on my laptop no matter what I did. When I buy a product, the product itself is just as important as the customer service and the company I buy it from. This company asked me to return the item with a tracking number. I paid to reship it to them when they were the ones who sent me a faulty product and I still have not heard from them nor gotten a refund! Furthermore, I am disappointed in Amazon because I have contacted them to resolve this matter and they have also ignored my request for help. This whole endeavor was a disappointment and I still do not have wireless on my laptop and now I have wasted money on shipping the product to me, shipping it back to them, and I have no product but I paid the company. How ridiculous!"
5,Young at Heart,"This book is as delightful today as when written....and a young girl (me) was fascinated by Jenny Jump....full of spice and vinegar, adventurous and resourceful, smart and funny, and absolutely a heroine to be admired. She is learning how to get along in a world just opening up to her...and, of course, that is the story of every little girl of 7 or 8 or 9, or any age, for that matter. There is nothing like the turn-style that really ""turned styles"" for true delight for a little girl. The characters are marvelous. I can read it today, and still find it a great read. John R. Neill became involved with Oz through his illustrating of Baum's stories, and in The Wonder City of Oz, he actually made Oz more real. Captivating, amusing, and full of lessons for young people today, especially young girls! (As a little girl, I was disappointed by the ending, but I will let the new reader discover why...doesn't at all detract from the book, just made me certain I would celebrate myself!)"
5,The best mobile around!,We have a butterfly and lady bug themed nursery for our newborn and this mobile is the icing on the cake. It really is beautiful and I love how the butterflies seem to float and bounce around in the air when the heat or air conditioning kicks on. You can raise or lower it based on your height needs and installation took all of two minutes. Worth every dime and better than anything I could find locally at Babies R Us. Perfect!
3,Uncovered Plebian Class,"Though the actual title is much more titillating, this little book would have more precisely been pegged Undercover Redneck. For the only thing truly trashy about it is a few characters who are garbage collectors. How many readers-to-be ordered this pulpy-sounding piece expecting a waller in squalor amidst the great unwashed? Many, most likely--only to find themselves immersed in the delightful tale of a yuppie-type ad exec who embarks on a slumming mission and discovers the down-home world of the everyday working class. From pro wresting programs and martial arts movies to hillbilly bars and mosh pits, this upscale Everyman stares his blue-collar counterpart in the face and, in the way of all novels, emerges forever changed. How and to what degree is the provocative plotline of this 128 page, easy to peruse volume. The punctuation could be more proper, but--hey--we aint talkin' penthouse here!"
1,Auto activation does not work for CS2 Illustrator,I have the latest version of OSX Tiger on my intel based Mac and when I open up a file in CS2 Illustrator the fonts will not auto activate. I have to do everything manually. I'm really disgusted with Suitcase Fusion.
1,GypsyMenco,Quite frankly the cd sucks. The cd is practically a copy of the band's previous work. No talents what so ever!!! don't waste your money..Richard
4,"very detailed, better for older child","I bought this book for my four-and-a-half year old niece who loves horses. As soon as I opened it, I knew it was the wrong book for a small child. This book begins with detailed diagrams of horse anatomy, followed by drawings like the one on the cover explaining horse care and riding techniques. It's a beautiful book, but better for a mature child or teen who is serious about learning about horses and might want to know where the ""common digital extensor tendon"" is located. The girl on the cover appears to be about the right age to fully appreciate this book."
4,Value for Money,"For the money you pay, this thing is worth the deal. I bought it recently. The picture and sound quality is spectacular. Don't forget to take advantage of the component video outputs. If you are looking for a low priced player, either for your primary system or the bedrooms you won't be disappointed. I was so happy to use it to watch Pearl Harbor!"
5,Better Than Paid In Full,Paid In Full Sounded a bit old fashion but this album seems more complete and better. Paid In Full Introduced us to a new type of rhyming skill but i think follow the leader is an improvement over it. paid in full is still a great album but i enjoyed this more. this isnt a sophomore slump
5,Too real for fake people,"this album is only for real people, if your a soulja boy fan then DO NOT BUY THIS, its only meant for the realest of real, this album is a pure classic, too fire"
5,Simply a Classic,"This album is awesome, right up there with Paid In Full, Eric B and Rakim's first album. A definite must have. Follow the Leader, Microphone Fiend, Lyrics of Fury, No Competition, To the Listeneres, Musical Massacre, the whole album is great!"
5,Beautiful,"If you have any interest in BDSM this is a movie you should see, It has everything you could possibly want to learn about the community. and while it is hyperbolie for most of us in the community it is accurate with its terms and rules."
2,Trashy and Sloppy,"The content was trashy, and the writing was sloppy. If you like trashy and you can tolerate sloppy for a few hours, this book will give you the worst highlights of the lives of the stars discussed. On the other hand, if you want to know the truth about these women in depth, you should search for individual, well-researched, well-written books on these subjects' lives.If you like to read bad writing, this book is a treat. Misplaced modifiers can be especially mirth provoking, and this writer is an adept in the genre. Other grammatical errors and plenty of typos add to the fun."
1,Not Worthy for the Collector,"Miss Wayne clearly did not investigate the rumors that fills this book. Many of her facts are not validated and that many more are known to be just rumor. The typographical errors abound, i.e. Wiltshire Boulevard in Los Angeles - it is Wilshire Boulevard. Her dates are deplorable - i.e. Esther Williams and Fernando Lamas were married for 22 years from 1969 until his death in 1982 - that's 13 years, Miss Wayne!As an avid collector of classic movies and the literature of the Golden Age of Hollywood, this book has no value to this or any other collector!"
2,pure speculation,i have read the book and i keep wondering if any of this really true. it is just pure specualtion. idle gossip. but it was fun reading it. why was so much attention given to grace kelly when she only made a couple pictures with MGM. katharine hepburn was a much bigger star and the author gave her a couple of pages. just not enough.
3,Chrysanthemum,"I had read this wonderful children's book before purchasing as an e-book. So my three star rating is not for the book or the illustrations. The author, the illustrator, the message of the book all are five star plus. I had to take two stars off because as an e-book, this title is difficult to navigate. On each page, the lovely illustrations are so small and no way that I could find to make them larger. The print for that page does enlarge somewhat when you touch just the right spot. And I do mean just the RIGHT SPOT. I had to fumble around the screen a bit to find that area and it made it difficult to keep a flow as I read the book. I was using the free Kindle Reader App on my iPad, so I have no idea if the experience would be different on a Kindle."
5,love it!,i used this book throughout my teaching career loved it ...so did the kids...many which had quite difficult and unique names...also i am Greek so my name was tough for them..so i felt this book taught understanding
4,Chrysanthemum,"I read Chrysanthemum. I would recommend this book. The reason I liked this book is because it taught me a lesson. In the book I read about Victoria saying, ""I wish name was Lily of the valley"". It taught me not to be mean to my friends. This helped convince me that it was a good book."
5,Shared Reading,"I teach kindergarten, and this book was great to use for shared reading. The students loved the big, colorful pictures, and the story about funny names."
4,happy,this album is very good. i'm not a huge fan of pop music like this but wow. replay is such a good song i cant stop listening to it. way good. if you like pop music listen to this
1,"WARNING!! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT, NO RICKY MARTIN HERE!","This is the absolute biggest example of false advertising and opportunistic marketing I have ever seen! There are no Ricky Martin videos or any of his music at all, the only RM you see is a short interview which has been dubbed over with a translator's voice. The rest is basically OPINIONS of various DJ's who offer SCANT and MOSTLY INACCURATE INFORMATION!! This video is more like a poorly done home movie for Puerto Rico tourism than any kind of documentary. If you are any kind of fan please don't buy this and don't let your friends buy it either, it's a complete waste of time!"
1,Who made this garbage!!!,"I can't believe I wasted one red cent on this tape. I am 27 years old and have followed Ricky Martin's career for 15 years (since Menudo). I know alot about Ricky Martin and 95% of the statements made by ""so-called"" knowledgable people in Latin music had no idea what they were talking about. Next time wait to be authorized by Ricky's people or ask some KNOWLEDGABLE FANS (such as myself). If you are a really fan, DON'T BY THIS TAPE!!"
2,Never quite worked right.,"- Callers frequently complained that I was inaudible due to low volume when using the handset.- The speakerphone-mode microphone stopped working the second week I had this phone.- Caller ID functions were not reliable (only displaying the information 1/3 calls)I telecommute, so a good telephone is a must! I do not recommend this phone because of the audio problems."
2,"Good phone, short life","I'm with Kevin ... it is just over a year that I have had this phone and the handset has faded into uselessness over the last month - guess when the warranty ran out - planned obsolescence or circumstance?? I really liked the ""chain dialing"" feature since I make alot of calls with a calling card and the phone was generally clear, although I often got the comment from the people at the other end of the line that I sounded distant or was hard to hear. The handsfree and memory dialing were very good and I used a headset off of the handset regularly. I thought the phone was reliable ... until the meltdown. I thought I was getting a long-term product, not a one-year disposable."
5,A must for Poodle Lovers,I got the book on the recommendation of a friend and we just loved it! We giggled as we read it because we imagined our own standard poodle doing the crazy things that Pantaloon does. No wonder Pantaloon inspired so many people to get poodles.
1,Angry Feminist Revisionist History,"This book was quite disappointing. It is a mish-mash of revisionist ""wymyn's"" herstory and feminist polemic ... with the occasional reference to pagan practices thrown in ... all of which are carefully crafted to exclude male practitioners. I was hoping to find information that would empower me as a woman, instead, I find myself wondering why I turned to this book rather than heeding my own inner strength."
2,Sadly very fragile,"This is a beautiful ring buts its ridiculously fragile. I've had this ring for a day, fell asleep with it on and woke up to it having a crack right where the band connects to the leaves."
2,looks good but..,the ring looks beautiful online as well as on your finger. But the band and where it connects is super thin that it continues to bend and disfigure. but i do love how it looks :-)
3,Got what I wanted,"It was delivered quickly, they are wonderful bicyle tires. Hard to find 18"" tires but I did here"
4,Worked pretty decently to fill some cracks in frefab fireplace bricks,Had a handfull of cracks in the refractory brick liner in our Superior prefab fireplace and was looking for an option to keep me from either ordering new bricks or from casting my own. I cleaned the fireplace out really well with the shopvac and then used an old toothbrush with water and thoroughly cleaned all of the cracks. The largest crack I had was probably a 1/16 of an inch and the smallest were hairline cracks. This actually worked better on the larger cracks as it was able to get into the crevice and fill the void. On the hairline cracks I appied a small bead and then smoothed it with my finger and it is starting to flake off of those spots. On the larger cracks it seems to be holding perfectly. I followed the curing directions to the letter.
4,Good.works well,"good. works well to patch the crack on my fireplace. curing time is long, after a couple of hours it still feels soft. i'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that."
1,Still Waters,"Enjoyed 'Guilty as Sin' & 'Night Sins' so much, but have been disappointed since. 'Still Waters' is a 'bodice ripper' thinly disguised as a mystery. Tammy can do much better"
2,"Still Waters -- No action, no suspense. A let-down by Hoag.","Having read several Tami Hoag novels, and already being ""hooked"" by some of her better ones (Ashes To Ashes), I was very disappointed by this novel. The characters seemed too stiff, one-dimensional. Very predictable plot, very little action or suspense. While it started off with a bang, the major portion of the book dragged on with little substance. Too many parts were not developed sufficiently, leaving a book that could have been interesting very flat, indeed. Still Waters' ending is as easy to figure out as an old ""Columbo"" episode. Hoping for better from Hoag."
2,Where's the beef?,"This book had great potential, but the author seemed to lose the mystery during the development of the relationship between Elizabeth and the police character. It felt like the book couldn't decide if it was a mystery or a romance novel. While I really enjoyed some of Hoag's other books, this one was really lacking a sense of direction. The minor characters were totally unbelievable and the clues screamed out who the killer was early on in the book. Definitely not a book I would recommend to a serious mystery reader."
5,Excellent,"I love Hoag's writing. her subtle mixture of romance and whodunnit is a really compelling one. Her characters are superbly well drawn, her plots great, prose style absolutely stunning, ability to describe setting and way of life first class. I adore her books. She creates characters that you really really care for, and who are so so realistic.If you like brilliantly written thrillers, with a wonderful cast of characters, a well weaved tapestry of occurences, and some romance thrown in for good measure, Tami Hoag is the author for you.The solution is unexpected, and well brought off. THis is certainly more of a ""whodunnit"" style novel than many of her other thrillers."
3,to much dirty talk,i liked elizabeth and dane but could not keep my mind on the story line fo been distracted by the vulgar talk.
3,"""Still Waters"" Run Not Deep Enough","In this romantic mystery, Tami Hoag gives us Elizabeth Stuart, a reputed divorcee of ill-gotten gains and a non-trusting Sheriff, Dane Jantzen.Their relationship begins with wisecracking banter from her and long lengthy stares from him after she is brought in for questioning about the dead body that dropped at her feet.I did enjoy the mix of romance & mystery. I just thought the plot could have been more fully developed. Still a good read.Thanks--CDS"
2,Not impressed...,Really not impressed with her writing. Don't know if I'll bother to read any more of her books. I've read a few already and have not been too impressed. I just wanted a good scary book! This one was too much romance thrown in.
1,CHEEZY!!!!,"Now I'm reminded why I don't read ""these kinds of books."" I was interested in reading something different, in the suspense/mystery genre. This book is an insult to anyone who appreciates well-written, meaningful fiction. It is mislabeled as a mystery novel. It is really a cheezy, sex novel with ridiculously inane dialogue. Give me a break. I will and put it down in the basement for the next garage sale!!!!"
1,Disappointing,"I have read other books by Hoag...but this one was rather disappointing. Right now, I am trying to finish it to justify the 5 bucks I paid for it. I love her other thrillers. This one can be summed up with three words...HIGHLY UNLIKELY and SEX. When I read a book such as this, I expect something relative to real life...this book has none of that. The scenes are unbelievable. And DANE and ELIZABETH are only interested in sex. To sum it up, when I was in eighth grade, I read War and Peace in one day. I'm struggling to finish Still Waters, and I've had it over a week. I don't even want to know who was the murderer. I just want to finish it because I have never left a book I started to read, unread. Shame on Tami Hoag for selling out. I've read some Harlequin Romances that were more concerned with plot than this. I wonder about the reviews from people who said they never read her before...they will be in for a big surprise if they are expecting this crap."
1,OH DEAR,"YAWN YAWN YAWN. Well what can you say about this novel except that Tami Hoag is truly in love with her own pen. This story could have been at least half as long but she foolishly peppers the book with ridiculous tales of cafes that haven't changed in 50 years and half a page to describe a woman's hairdo. And there's the problem. It's way too descriptive. There's page upon page of pointless ""storytelling"". I mean there are sections in the book where at least six pages go by without a word being uttered by any character because Hoag sees fit to bore us to death with irrelevant ""landscapes"". Therefore the book keeps stalling and never comes close to gathering any kind of momentum.For insomniacs only."
1,Bad Book By Usually OK Author,"I was so ticked off when I finished this book. Huge waste of time -- so glad I did not pay good money for it. In my family we tend to pass around books we have read, and then donate them to nursing homes and the like. I pitched this one into the trash, however, rather than inflict it on anyone else. Ms. Hoag must have incriminating photos of the folks who wrote the glowing promotional blurbs, as they bore no resemblance to the text inside the covers. There was nothing to like about this improbable story peopled with unsympathetic characters trapped in hackneyed situations. Between the excruciatingly bad dialogue, weak editing, and (insult to injury) bad proof-reading, my fingers itched for the blue pencil through-out. Ms. Hoag is lucky I don't have her home telephone number because I would have had to call her up in the wee hours when I finished STILL WATERS to say, ""What on Earth were you thinking?"""
3,DO NOT judge all Hoag books by SW. This is NOT a new book!!,"Tami Hoag started as a romance novelist. This book was first released in 1992 and was one of her first forays into the mystery world. She has since gotten a lot better at writing mysteries. Although I did enjoy this novel, I agree with those that say it is too harlequin. Read some of her more recent novels (like Ashes to Ashes or the Sin books) if you want more mystery and less romance."
2,Doesn't live up to all the hype,"I purchased this book because I'm interested in the Akashic records and it had great reviews. I guess everyone has different tastes. I don't like how it's just case studies. Very boring. But if you're into that, go for it. I couldn't even finish reading it because it was sooo boring."
1,Akashic Records,"I read this on my Kindle, and, as with many Kindle downloads, the transfer from book format to Kindle is poor.I found the book itself disappointing and certainly not good value with frequesnt repetition throughout the text."
1,Edgar Cayce on the Akashic Record: The Book Of life,"The References were very good,I did not think that the entire book, was simply case histories.Perhaps my expectations were to high , overall the book is good."
4,Paul Blart:Mall Cop,"At first getting into the movie you want to turn it off, but once the movie unfolds it actually is funny,slapstic funny. Kevin James Doesn't Disappoint. Yes It could have been better or funnier but it's worth watching."
2,Not worth it,"not much to write, very predictable and bad jokes which are solely based on clumsiness. Don't waste your time."
2,The movie sucks and the video quality was okay....,"I'm a big Kevin James fan, but this movie sucked. The making of the movie is cooler than the acutal movie....big disappointment!"
1,Watch on cable only,"Have you ever went to see a movie and realized that every funny part of the film was in the preview. Welcome to Mall Cop. While I loved Kevin James in his other films, this was really just dreadful. Quick summary: Overweight security guard is the subject of an endless fat joke, stalks a beautiful girl who works at the mall, manages to blunder his way into saving the day in a completely predictable plot. It is the worst comedy I have seen in a long time."
2,Performance,The mirror does not stay up straight becaue it only has one suction cup in the center of the back...so it hangs forward and cannot be used very well.
3,cute travel mirror,"This mirror is smaller than I expected. 7"" looks like 5"", about the size to travel with so will need a 9"" mirror for bathroom use. The single suction cup leaves it hanging lopsided from the bathroom mirror. I'd prefer at least 3 suction cups to affix it flat to the bathroom mirror. The magnification is good."
4,Still a classic after all these years,Mill's Utilitarianism is a very interesting and modern essay. It surely has endured the test of time so far and will continue to do so for many generations to come.
5,This TV does not disappoint,"I purchased this TV in November after much research online and in the various stores...This was the best set for the price and I could not be more satisfied. After 5 months of owning it, I don't know how I did without it! The picture is clear, the sound is terrific and nicely complements my home theater system...Although leary about spending nearly [$] for a purchase online, I was very happy to save the cost of shipping and sales tax. My only complaint was that the company that delivered the set sent only one person for what is clearly a two person job. I ended up having to help the guy get it into my house."
2,Doesn't Hold A Charge!,"I've been using Norelco razors for the past 27 years and this model has to be THE WORST! Within six months the Charge LED is constantly glowing, even after being fully charged! It's been holding less and less of a charge as time progresses. The only reason I rated it two stars instead of one or none is because you can still use it with the AC cord plugged in. Yes, it's no longer a cordless razor, but at least it works. Other Norelco cordless models I owned lasted a good three to five years before the batteries would no longer charge. As other reviewers have stated, it's easy to clean just by running it under hot tap water, but I wouldn't buy this model again!"
3,Beware of black.,"I haven't had any trouble burning or playing the CDs, but one of the ""cool colors"" is black. I don't care about the colors. I bought these because they were on sale and relatively inexpensive, but I label the CDs I burn with markers. The CDs I got were black. You can't label these with your usual blue or black or whatever Sharpies. I'll need to buy labels or a white marker or something to label these things.I'm sure there are some people who love the black CDs, but black just strikes me as a singularly bad idea."
2,Mediocre Betty Grable Musical,"The good news is that Fox finally released a Betty Grable musical on DVD, so I'm guessing fans are really happy about that. The bad news is that, as many have pointed out, they picked one of the worse. The reason seems pretty obvious: Grable is best remembered nowadays precisely for being a WWII ""Pin-Up Girl"" and, like when this film was first produced, the DVD makers are just banking on that. Betty Grable musicals were formulaic and not particularly sophisticated. They relied too heavily on her charms (and showing off her famous legs), but even her charisma cannot do much to save this movie. If you love Betty Grable no matter what, rejoice the fact that at least one of her musicals is on DVD, if not, then I suggest you skip this one and wait for the DVD release of one of her better movies."
3,WHERE ARE MICKEY AND JUDY WHEN YOU NEED 'EM?,"In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one. Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas --- especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable, Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda, The memory of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going. And make one yearn for Mickey and Judy."
3,Mediocre Film Noir is better than none,"Like all of the other reviewers, I am an avid film noir fan; so it was with delight that I purchased this set at a discount. However, I cannot in good conscience grant the same rave reviews that many of the other reviewers bestowed. Still, I am glad that I purchased this collection. As the films are all B-Movies, you don't expect top notch dialog and acting or elaborate set pieces. In fact, the lack of polish often adds to the enjoyment of the genre. As long as you don't expect ""The Third Man"" or ""Double Indemnity"" these little offerings can make for fun viewing."
4,Film Noir Through and Through,"First, these were a gift for my wife, and she liked them very much. On that alone, I should perhaps have given them 5 stars. But having watched most of them with her, it is hard to rate anything less than a classic that high. They are what they are, Film Noir. Pretty simple stories; short and to the point. The acting and plots are typical to the genre. The condition of the transfers was fine. Era excepted, nothing particularly racy about these. A lot of pleasant viewing for an old movie fan."
5,Personal and Real,The monologs in this book are real and can be used in many ways. It is clear that the writer used many real stories and situations.
1,No serial number. Therefore no service.,I had trouble getting this printer server to work. When I called NetGear for help I was refused because my printer server had the serial number blacked out.
2,Poorly packaged,Desenex is a good product.The company/person shipping the items isn't. The three cans of Desenex were loose in the shipping box. One of the cans of Desenex was open and powder was realease causing quite a mess. The USPO had to repack the box in two plastic bags. I'm sure that PO had a lot of cleaning to do. Very carless and shipshod packing.
4,Healing for Body and Mind,"I have been enjoying this cd for a couple months now. With an undertone of relaxing music, Cynthia Larson delivers a guided meditation that is as empowering as it is contemplative. I recommend it for beginners in the area of guided meditation.My only negative comment is that sometimes the spoken parts can seem too frequent, though that may only be a matter of my personal preference. Overall, this is an enjoyable cd. For those who may be interested in non-guided meditations, which evokes the frequencies of the brain in deep states of consciouness, I also recommend the Awakened Mind System by Dr. Jeff Thompson (http://www.therelaxationcompany.com)."
1,An Axe to Grind,"In reading this diatribe, I learned two things. First, Jane Ellen Wayne is in love with the memory of Robert Taylor. Secondly, Jane Ellen Wayne hates everything about Barbara Stanwyck. That's about all that this little book has to offer. I don't think I've ever read a more one-sided characature about anyone. I hope Miss Stanwyck never read this tripe. We'll probably never know what exactly happed between Stanwyck and Taylor in their marriage and maybe that's as it should be. To quote Miss Stanwyck, ""The more you kick something that's dead, the more it stinks."" Rest in peace Stany. I hope her ghost doesn't haunt me because I bought this book!"
5,Great Product,"I recently purchased two of these for my new wife and I to take on our camping honeymoon in the Southwest US.The trip was in October and the temps got into the low teens at night and the bag was quite comfortable. I would recommend wearing heavy socks in low temps, because my feet got cold on a couple of nights (with light socks).We bought non-mummy bags so we could zip them together (it was our honeymoon!!), but I don't recommend this. It really increases the cold spots.When zipped up as one bag, and the hood drawn you should be comfortable down in the teens with long underwear and socks. I wouldn't make other plans if going on a trip where 15 degree or below weather is predicted.The weather rating on most bags is SURVIVABILITY not COMFORT."
3,barely readable,"This author does not know how to write, explain or put his thoughts on paper. He rambles, says the same thing many times, and he does not explain the most basic of thoughts. Its basically a book about how day trading/scalping is (are) bad, but his methods are good. He must say that same thing 25 times throughout the book. Enough already. Not for the beginner. He is not a very good teacher, although his methods for trading may work for some people."
1,Sales pitch,"This book is nothing more than a sales pitch for the author's trading school. From page 62, ""All screens, strategies, and formulas are given to students of <authors school>."" Really? I thought I bought this book to learn the author's screens, strategies and formulas. Further, chapter seven is dedicated to convincing the reader of the value of the authors ""biomechanical trader"" methodology. I completed the book wondering what my payment should be for enduring this pitch."
1,hilarious,I was a sucker to buy this book. Amazing how author could actually put his name on the cover.
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered a Red Wall Phone, and received a beige wall phone. Its not what I ordered, and when I wanted to return/exchange the phone, the seller basically told me tough. So now I'm stuck with a phone, that I will not use and is tucked away in a closet somewhere."
3,"Fun yes, different yes, difficult...perhaps too much so",I found this game to be somewhat overwhelming at least in the skirmish mode. The time you get to build your defenses seems much too short; especially in comparison to that of your opponents who have so much as a fleet assembled ready to stomp you flat. Overall it is a good game...but the swift enemy fleet buildup and the feeling of 'doomed from the start' get depressing after a time.
5,"Cute, 3 year olds love it...","I can tell you that after my kids learned the alphabet this was probably the best introduction to short vowels. They like to say things like ""dddoooogggg""... that begins with d and ends in g. However recently we had an argument over the word banana, as one twin calls it a ""nana"" and the other uses ""banana"", so the argument was over this word started with a ""b"" or a ""n"". This video has a catchy song and shows all sorts of short vowel words (mat, sat, cat, etc.). Really awesome video."
3,Doesn't look good so far...,"I'm only less than 2 minutes into the DVD and this is what I hear: ""In 1448, encouraged by a friend, Michelangelo became an apprentice...""A mistake obviously, but why leave it in? One minute you say he was born in 1475, the next minute he's an apprentice 27 years earlier? Now I don't trust anything I'm going to hear from the presenter..."
2,Not Good,I was expecting more Govt Mule but didn't get what I wished for. There are only 4 tracks that I like. What a waste of money and time.
5,Quintana's best solo album.,"""Maestro de Rumberos"" is a song that I could have sworn Justo Betancourt wrote. It has a very cocky attitude style to it, with great music resembling his Eddie Palmieri stage. ""Guajirita"" is a very good song along with ""Nada para ti"" also. ""El Juez Final' is a great fast paced song musically , combined with very good lyrics about the biggest judge of them all. ""Hay que tener sazon"" is a spicy son montuno that will have moving some part of your body (although I find it somehow similar to Ismael Miranda's ""Para Componer un Son."")Overall the album is top-notch and showed that Quintana could hold his own without Palmieri. His best solo effort in my opinion. I give it 5 stars even though there are 3 boleros, which I almost always skip.*Edit: I would like to add that this album has an all star array of arrangers like Papo Lucca, Bobby Valentin, Louie Cruz and Louie Ramirez. That should tell what you should expect."
2,Do let the box fool you....,This is a TINY lego set - I was very disappointed when it came - based on the number of bricks in the set - I was expecting a lot more - but instead the bricks were all really little ones... I'll need another set to build anything substantial.
3,Works fine as advertised,Installation was quick and easy. Was a bit of a challenge to understand how to set the range since there were no instructions so had to do it by try and retry.
4,challenging,"I bought it for a grandchild,but, I just had to try it out. I found it quite fun and challenging. So did my grandson."
2,Brewstation Pro,Liked everything about this coffee maker except it started leaking almost immediately. It made great tasting coffee but to return it. Bummer!
2,Brewstation Hamilton Beach - LEAKS all over the counter,"We purchased the Brewstation by Hamilton Beach and owned it for about 1 year now. Well a few weeks ago it started leaking all over our counters. At first it was a little & now it's leaking alot so, we have discontinued using it. Lucily we have a Keurig, making coffee in less than 2 minutes. The Brewstation was great & we loved it while it works but, cleaning leaked coffee is not what we want to do in the mornings. We also noticed it leaked coffee into the clean water reservoir, not a good thing either."
2,I'm DISSAPOINTED!!,"When I rented this movie I was very disapointed. I thought it would be funny but it sure wasn't and the bad acting didn't help much in this case. I thought it was gonna be a blair witch spoof (think about how awesome a TROMA blair witch spoof would be) but it was nothing like that. The only good part is the gore(when their was hardly any) I'd just recommend renting the movie to see if you like it before buying it. All those other TROMA fans out there that liked the movie don't be mad at me because it's just my opinion. Also instead of renting this movie go out and rent true classics like The Toxic Avenger,Class Of Nuke Em High,Terror Firmer,Cannibal the Musical,Redneck Zombies and even Tromeo and Juliet I could go on forever. And remember Toxie loves you!!"
3,Getting long in the tooth,Frommer (may he rest in peace) was the pioneer of budget travel books. He has now been overtaken by other writers for the impecunious and his epigones do not have his wit and originality - they write in humorlesss cliches. It's worth buying all the books you can because even budget travel to Europe is a major expense. I think he devotes to much space to restaurant reviews in places where there are rows of restaurants with their prices and menus on display. Hotel reviews are more useful. Budget travel books have to be bang up-to-date and this one has a 1998 publication date. A 2001 edition for the Islands is promised. No illustrations except maps.
3,Cord Not So Chew-Proof,"Although I unplugged the heating pad while I was not at home one day, I made the mistake of keeping it in his kennel. He chewed right through the protective cord coating (thank goodness it was unplugged!) I no longer feel it is safe to use."
1,electrical interference,"This warmer caused electrical interference with every electrical appliance in my house - cordless phone, baby monitor, even cable TV. I don't know if the product was defective or is simply not manufactured to prevent interference. If you take a chance and buy it, know that the seller DOES NOT ACCEPT ANY RETURNS if you actually open the box and find out the thing doesn't work. Buy something that specifically states it doesn't cause interference."
3,"survey of Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico","It's considerably difficult to make sense of so much land in one book, so this guide ends up with brief entries and succinct recommendations. It's useful for suggestions on where to eat and sleep, and places to visit by car. If you want to do a more ""adventure"" trip, such as to the national parks, you might be better served by more specialized books out there for specific areas. Nonetheless this is handy to have in the car to help decision making on places to eat and stay, while informing what one might want to see. There is a Lonely Planet guide to the entire US. With so much to cover in limited space lots of good stuff inevitable gets left out, and what ends up covered (and in what level of detail) is largely a matter of personal preference."
5,The Most Badass Band This Side of Pacoima!!!,"Wow, I just emptied my third diaper and I'm only on track two. I'm guessing these guys drink nun blood for breakfast. Last time I heard anything this powerful, I was standing behind a flatulent rhino at the zoo. Enjoy & beware!"
2,So-so at best,"I bought this not knowing what a cheap quality I'd truly be getting, I've rarely seen such soft wood. We use it and it's in our tree, but the wood is so soft that when I tried to screw it into the dead part of the tree(so it would stay upright, thought I had a perfect spot), it just began to designate, and therefore lays up there on it's back(deciding what to do next, my little girl loves birdhouses, might buy new and try again). I even tried repairing it after the top begin to come apart but again soft wood made me fail in that task. I can not in good conscience recommend this item at all!!!"
3,Still trying,I am still trying to find time in my day to really get into the exercises. I think it can only be a good thing.
5,"I was there- and yes, it sounded this good!","I first saw B&B in Texas, 1985, opening for Kiss. Two years ago I had by chance relocated to Portland where the band originated, and was lucky enough to attend this one-off reunion show at Key Largo (now called ""Ohm"".) Think and say what you will about the 80's ""hair bands"", but these guys were the real deal, and this performance proves it- Definitely seasoned pros! Unfortunately the reunion was only temporary, so I'd love to see their back catalogue reissued on CD!"
3,Good But Not As Good As The Original,"The remake was good but I didn't enjoy it as much as the original movie. I cared about Coco, Leroy, Doris, Bruno and the other characters in the first movie. I also bought the soundtrack. But I didn't get so caught up in the new characters lives while trying to become famous. I didn't even buy the new soundtrack.However, it was worth seeing just to see/hear Megan Mullally sing. She is very talented, not only as an actor but a singer. It was good to see Debbie Allen again. She was in the original movie and TV series.There were some great actors to watch, Charles S. Dutton, Kelsey Grammer and Bebe Neuwirth, who outshone the young cast. I found myself wanting to know more about them than the students.The dancing was fun to watch and the music was good but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I did the original. Sometimes, a remake just isn't as good."
2,"Big Hype, Big Disappointment","Other reviewers have probably already said it better, but I just have to throw mine in. This movie was pretty terrible. I am a big fan of ""dance movies"", or any form of the musical for that matter. So when I saw the trailer for this one I was beyond excited. Of course then it fell into the common trap of showcasing its best numbers in the trailer, and the movie was left with no wow-factors, no show-stoppers. The most impressive number, in my opinion, was the dance sequence to Black and Gold. But 2 minutes out of a nearly 2 hour movie is clearly not enough. And what happened to our show-stopping finale? It was so underwhelming it felt like the director was playing a cruel joke on the audience. Speaking of under, the characters were so underdeveloped, I couldn't care less about them. Trying to squeeze multiple characters over 4 years of High School into one movie was a huge mistake. The kids are all talented, for sure, but this movie did no one any justice."
2,bench grinder,grinder looks good but is still a very cheap grinder . i got what i paid for. do not look for it to last very long. very weak 1/2 hp. motor.
3,Large,"It's OK, but like a fish net shirt. The sleeves are to the elbow. I don't like it. I'll have the sleeves shortened."
5,Comfortable - exactly what I was expecting,I absolutely love this shirt. It was exactly what I was expecting. It is very comfortable and looks very nice.
1,Russell Dri Power,"I purchased these shirts here before and the shirts were great. But the latest shipment I received does not have the same quality. So if you're looking for the style made in Lesotho with 60% Cotton 40% Polyester, then don't buy here. The latest shipment I received are 100% Polyester. I'm 5'11"", and the shirt barely covers my belly. Not very useful at the gym, unless you don't mind you belly showing when you do pull downs."
3,Order a size smaller,"If you are looking for a body-fit, dri-power tee, this product isn't it. I usually wear medium to large t-shirts and prefer to workout in body fit or non baggy clothes. I've already read reviews about how big they were and to order a size smaller. Mediums are usually a tight fit for me. I'm 5'8"", weigh 180 lbs., muscular built. When I ordered three different medium colors. Wow.. when I received them, the mediums were pretty loose on me. I could easily grab an inch on side of my torso before stretching the product.The shirts are made of good material, comparable to Underarmour and other products. It just doesn't look as great as them. Wearing the Russell brand made me feel like I'm working out with a king size pillow sheet."
2,Inferior to the 3M 345 I am used to.,"I recently used the last of a 36 yd roll of 3M Cat. 345 tape that I have been using for years to secure templates to the work piece for routing or to make other temporary attachments in my shop. I could not find this particular carpet tape locally and so ordered on line. It is not the same tape. It has a 3M label on the inside of the roll but nowhere does it give a cat. no. or otherwise identify the product except as ""Carpet Tape"". That may be, but compared to the Cat. 345 I just used up, the adhesive has a foul smell and does not come up cleanly when the tape is pulled off of a surface. It leaves a mess. Nor does it adhere as well. The label is half in Spanish. It claims to have been manufactured in the US but I wonder if it is a counterfeit."
3,Not exciting,"I played both Fallout 1 and 2, and although I knew that fallout tactics would be different, I don't really like it that much: I wasn't really excited while playing, I was bored by the plot, and I think money I spent for this game are not worth it."
1,Beware...,"Seems Interplay shipped this puppy bad files on some cd's so many people out there cannot play the game once it is installed. Graphic (inventory, backgounds) do not show up, makeing the game (ahem) somewhat unplayable. As usual with a new game, it is wise to wait a few monts/patches before purchasing unless you enjoy paying to work as a beta tester."
4,Solid Dispensational Commentary,"This is a good commentary. It's not a detailed exegisis, but its focus is on the main theme of Matthew, the coming kingdom. If you're a dispensationalist you will find it quite appealing with its emphasis on prophecy and the coming kingdom."
5,Larry Adler - Jazz Genius,"If you love the jazz standards of the '30s and '40s, there is no other artist who can perform them like Larry Adler. His phrasing and intonation defy imitation. Forget about harmonica playing....his performances eclipse all others, be they vocal or instrumental."
4,Underworld ftw (aware of languagues),"Underworld trilogy is probably the best vampire movies made recently, dont come up with sparkling vamps crap... Plus Kate Beckinsale rocks in this one...I will need to add that, for the blu-ray trilogy version the languages and subs are different for each movie.. so be careful if this matters to you..For Underworld, AUDIO: ENGLISH, FRENCH AND ITALIAN, same as subs, Underworld:Evolution, AUDIO:ENGLISH AND FRENCH, SUBS:ENGLISH, FRENCH, CHINESE, PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH, and for Rise of the Lycans, AUDIO: ENGLISH, FRENCH, PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH, same as subs."
4,Excellent Collection,"This is an excellent collection to have, a must own, Just need to get a hold of ""Underworld Awakening"" to complete this packet."
3,3 Star,"Item arrived quickly at my door, and as described.However there was no screen paper in the DVD Case. Only the 3 DVD Disc where in the Case."
2,Ultraviolet is streaming not digital copy!,You must be connected to the internet while watching - forget taking it in the car. It is not a digital copy but basically Netflix that you pay extra $$ for. Totally crappy.The movies and set are good though.
3,Rise of the Lycans has more grains than a rice field,"I'd be giving this 4 stars, if not for the third movie of the set - Rise of the Lycans.I don't think I have ever seen so much grain in a movie. It was more than distracting. It was more than irritating. I have no words to describe it.I fiddled with the color, contrast, brightness, filtering, etc on the TV & player for the better part of an hour whilst stopping the movie numerous times to replay earlier scenes to check the effectiveness of my new settings.On the bright side, the new settings looked fantastic on some of my better looking movies. So, if nothing else, at least it forced me to tweak some things.In the end, I made it bearable for those with really bad eyesight.Ultimately, Rise of the Lycans pretty much looks like it was downloaded from the internet or something.Rise of the Lycans, on it's own, gets 2 stars from me.Both Underworld & Underworld Evolution look fine. No complaints there. I would give each of those 4 stars."
3,Packaging,Love the movies but really dislike how all three dvd's are just stacked on top of each other in one case.
5,terrific movie set,love all of them. this is a great trilogy of movies and how all of them are tied into each other. very entertaining in high definition. can watch it over and over.
2,Incorrect movie added to UV account,"I purchased Underworld Trilogy (Underworld (unrated), Underworld: Evolution and Underworld: Rise of the Lycans) (+UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray] and redeemed the digital code on 5-5-12 at [...]Sony added Ultraviolet copies to my ultraviolet account at [...].and at [...]The correct copy (134 min) was added to the sony account however the wrong copy of Underworld (122 min) was added to my uv account.The underworld (unrated) 134 min 2003 ([...]) should have been added instead of Underworld 2003/ R/ 122 min. ([...]) which unfortunately is only available in a SD version on Vudu.The transfer to Blu-ray was excellent but stars were deducted for not getting the correct digital version of Underworld.Update 6-5-2012! The correct digital copy of Underworld (Unrated) was finally added to my Ultraviolet account on 6-4-2012.I can now watch the digital copy of the movie I paid for in HDX on Vudu."
4,Great movies,Got the whole box set for under $30 and the 1st is the extended version. Great quality BD transfer will rock your entertainment center with powerful sound and clear video. There was a slight drop in quality in the 3rd movie for some reason at times but overall pretty happy with the purchase.
5,great pack,"love Kate in this role of Selene the sexiest vamp of all, also full of action and great story and film"
2,DoF Guide,"A decent visual aid, but not overly useful or easy to use for the price. I tried it but wouldn't recommend it."
2,Dual VCRs,"I was happy with my Dual VCR when I first bought it. However, after using it for a while, Deck 1 no longer worked. The fast rewind ended up rewinding so fast, it broke whatever stops the tape. Since I use the dual decks for recording, rewinding, etc., it was no longer useable."
5,Excellent!,"Classic! Musical, comical, boy meets girl. This movie makes you feel good and happy. It seems to pull you in and makes you feel as if you are really in Havana! Great costumes, great musical numbers. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the classic musicals of the 40's."
4,The second time around...,"Luigi Texidor's second solo effort was also produced (like its predecessor) by the great Papo Lucca and brings us some more great Salsa grooves from one of Puerto Rico's earthiest and traditional Salsa soneros. By itself, the opener ""Pitirre Pa' Guaraguao"" (a true killer Guaguanco!) justifies buying the entire album but the other seven tracks are all fine in their own right. Sadly, as was the case with most Fania CD titles reissued during the early to mid-1990s the remastering quality leaves much to be desired but this CD deserves to be in your collection (if you can find it)."
3,Homeopathic Migraine Medication,"I bought this item to try and get off my prescription medications. I have only used the item a few times and each time I took two pills. Thet seemed to aleviate my headache, but unfortunately did not do much for my excruiating migraine.I would imagine that these pills do work half way decent and probably work very well for other people, but for me, not so good. I have taken other homeopathic medications that do what they are meant to do, but since I have only taken this kind a few time, I can't give it 5 stars."
3,Mediocre variety,"A wide variety of musical styles and nature views, but none spectacular. Better to focus your money on styles and views you prefer."
4,"The lotion really helped my dry heels. However, ...","The lotion really helped my dry heels. However, it has an unusual odor, which is probably the menthol. My wife used it on her cracked hands, and it really improved them too. We live in a dry climate in Utah and our skin really takes a beating. I'd recommend this product to people with dry skin, if you don't mind the unusual aroma."
3,"Interesting stuff !!!! See the full spectrum of his work, this and more, ...Do yourself a favour!","It is beneficial checking out Mike's work. It is always helpful, good, to have the chance to see how someone has evolved into where they are now.Glad I took the chance to see and hear, all of Mike's work.If you like to see the full spectrum of his work, get yourself also other work of him. This DVD is great having, absorb what is said before you watch and order his latest stuff.I am glad I took the chance to see all of Mike's work. If you like to see the full spectrum of his work, get this DVD and some of his cd's...Do yourself a favour!Therafter move on to his latest DVD, ""Thoughts become Things"", which I find deserves a five star review, it's an awesome result of years progress, but first watch this DVD.I defenitely can advise people to get it all, I am enjoying it.Rob Waterlander[...]"
4,Great Cell Phone Holder,"Fits any type of phone that has the body of a LG8300, and just barely fits a krzr from motorola"
3,Far from his best.,"I really thought that this album would be better than it was, specially after hearing ""El Caballero"". Don't get me wrong, the album isn't bad. It has an enjoyable merengue that is about having fun with other men's women, but I think he just threw in too many fillers in this album. ""Mensaje a los Barrios"" is the only song that stuck because of its great message to the ""ghettos"" of Puerto Rico to stop violence. Other than this, all the really has is Luigi's charisma and voice. I really wouldn't go out of my way for this one."
4,Great Toy!,My 4 yr. old grandson loves this work bench. It's pretty substantial and will last him a long time. Worth the money and made very well.
3,Review,It's not that I don't like this toy It's just that My 3yr old doesn't really play with it. And the drill isn't strong enough to screw the screws in.
2,Day of Reckoning,"What can be said about a comedy in which the moving force behind the story is an active nuclear bomb in the hands of three teenage losers and two bumbling, idiotic ""bad guys""? Obviously the script was written by either a teenage boy or some other loser who believes that all adults are complete morons! Still, there is something to be said about this twisted belief. Sometimes it is often necessary to poke fun at the nonsensical acts of politicians and the self-absorbed acts of non-caring parents."
5,caligraphy pens,This is a duplicate order but we decide to keep and pay for it and it turned out well excelent product
1,Covercraft tailgate net,It took longer than normal to receive. The box was smashed up & taped up with packing tape. Great quality but my Akita dogs are chewers & I dont recommend this for dogs that chew. It did not work out at all from beginning to end.
4,Useful guidebook,"Three of us recently travelled Tanzania using this book as the only guide.Although some information is outdated, but it's still very useful providing guideline for us..."
3,I felt the need to correct the review from below...,"This ISN'T the movie with julia roberts. this has monique parent, ashlie rhey, and another woman whose name escapes me. It has no plot. no story, no anything other than nudity.note the difference in names.america'S sweetheartsandamericAN sweethears.imagine your suprise getting this in the mail expecting julia roberts, and getting a soft-core porn flick instead.Now that would be comedy."
1,Doesn't work as advertised,"I am trying to glue a handle back on a porcelain sugar bowl, and I bought this at Michaels. The package instructs you to ""slowly squeeze adhesive onto surface"" - well, this glue is as thin as milk, so there's no ""slowly"" about it - it gushes out of the tube. Then the instructions say to apply the glue and hold porous pieces together for 15-40 seconds, then allow 16 hours before putting into dishwasher. I held the two pieces together for 15 minutes and they were still as wet as could be, and not set up at all, so I couldn't leave the bowl to set for 16 hours as instructed. I can't clamp or tape the handle while the glue sets, it's just not going to work that way. Waste of money for sure.I ended up getting Loctite Ultra gel Super glue, which is a nice gel, a very accurate applicator tip, set up right away, and after letting the sugar bowl sit for a day, the handle is firmly stuck on. Don't buy the Elmer's glue, I recommend Loctite."
1,Weak product,"I tried this on a couple of different pieces. The first was a piece that had an old jagged break and had prior adhesives applied. I cleaned the old adhesives and tried the Elmers. Became a bit sticky, but didn't hold.Then I tried the adhesive on another piece that had only recently been broken with a very clean break. Same result. This very thin glue didn't even consider adhering the pieces together.I'll have to try something different."
1,it broke,"The blender worked ok, but broke after 3 years. I called Hamilton B, and they would not replace it and said they did not have a part to help. She said cars dont work after awhile...whatever, I want my next blender to not fill a landfill after 3 years. Get a nice brand that stands behind their work."
1,stinks!!!,why would you continue to keep this product on line if there arent anymore. since its a clearance item i would think that one would delete it off your system. ive been on your site for a couple of days looking for a new grill and keep seeing it here. its very deceiving.
2,Forumlation changed.. not effective,"When I first purchased this product, I thought it worked so well. Subsequent purchase did not turn out well. Formulation is diluted and it even stings the skin. Not worthwhile anymore. Better to use a PediEgg."
3,Pretty Feet and Hands is a very good ...,"Pretty Feet and Hands is a very good product. I liked the results a lot. But I also thought it took a little too long to start working and it was pretty messy. It does do the job, though. My feet are very rough because I run three to five miles about five days a week. With daily use, this product has removed all most all of the calluses from my feet. I would recommend it to my friends. I have not found anything that works better."
3,good quality,"I think pretty hands and feet is the best I have use to remove dead, dry rough skin. Makes my feet feel soft and smooth. I have been looking everywhere for this product went on the internet and learn where to find pretty hands and feet."
5,"""NOT JUST ANOTHER PRETTY FOOT""","I've used this product for years..... and some of those years it was almost impossible to find, but I never gave up. So you can imagine how surprised I was when It came up on my favorite ""have everything site"" Amazon.comAnd, If you, too give ""PRETTY FEET & HANDS"" a try you will know why it was worth all the trouble to find!!!It's so simple to use and instantly effective. Just squeeze a squirt or two on on your hands, (fronts and backs) feet, elbows or knees and start rubbing up and back creating a friction type motion between the product and your skin and watch the dead skin just roll off.I've even used it on my face and neck, that's how mild it is. Take it from someone who sees and uses Dr.Frederick Brandt's Microdermabrasion (exfoliating cream). But please don't tell the doctor!!!!!"
3,Pretty Feet & Hands rough Skin Remover-Exfoliant,"Have been using this product for many years. Used to work great exfoliating also the face. The last batch I bought does not seem to work as well, feels like the lotion has been diluted, and to achieve any results the skin has to be oilfree and dry, otherwise it barely does anything. I also leave the tube open for the the lotion to dry up somewhat, then it seems to work better. Another way of a company making more money on a product without raising the prices too much."
4,EXCELLENT VIDEO - MUSIC NOT RELAXING,The video itself I felt was very good in all areas of quality. The video was a blessing. The music was very loud and somewhat brash - guess they were trying to impart a feeling of excitement. I would have much preferred relaxing music to go along with it. The music was my only complaint.
2,Not what I was looking for,I wasn't impressed with this book. It never caught my attention. It didn't seem to help with my trust issue.
3,"Good advice, but bad examples.","I bought this book when I was looking for advice on better relationships. This has a psychological perspective to building relationships and does a nice job giving one perspective on new ways to look at your relationships through visual diagrams and surveys. However, some of the examples came off as blatantly sexist, especially the example with a woman who tells her husband to stop wasting their money. It was trying to demonstrate standing up for oneself, but when it concludes with ""now she is free from oppressive male authority"" it just comes off as sexist.She really does have good advice on relationships, but if examples like the one above would offend you and stop you from furthering your reading then perhaps looking somewhere else might be best."
3,just ok,disappointed that the sounds are so similar to one another. Too short in loop generated sound - and too fast - not as soothing as expected. Ocean waves sounded more like ocean storm. Like the volume and 1 hour duration tho.
2,Poor quality compared to its predecessor,"This is a low quality white noise machine. We have another one that has the exact same design but with the brand name Obus Forme. It has been used every night and during kid's nap times for 6 1/2 solid years. I think the item was downgraded when it became Conair because in spite of the identical design it is made shabbily with lighter weight plastic and all around cheaper and flimsier material. Unlike the first one we bought by Obus Forme, it has horrible sound quality and within a few months it became problematic to turn on an off, as the buttons don't respond to being pressed and they have to be pressed repeatedly for them to work. The volume is bad, too, and it goes from very low volume to only slightly higher at maximum volume. I would expect it not to last much longer and I've only had it for less than a year. It appears to be on the verge of breaking. It's a shame that the one by Obus Forme is no longer available."
5,Great sound machine for newborns !,This was a must have product for our newborn. It provides continuous white noise. We use the running stream option as a replacement of the Sleep Sheep which only goes for 45 minutes max. I can't recommend this product enough. It did break once but Conair was very responsive in replacing the product. The product has since last over 14 months without issue.
2,I would not buy it if I knew the quality,I bought the Conair Sound Therapy for my family member who has hard time falling asleep. To me the sounds are not good quality. They don't sound like the real ones. I wish I had paid more money and get a better one. I don't recommend it
5,Great sound machine for home or travel,"This sound machine is very good for the white noise, which is the only setting that I use. It doesn't seem to have issues with the volume adjustment that I've seen with other machines where the sound starts to develop static over time.This machine is also small enough to fit in a suitcase, so I take it on all my trips. One caution is that I took this to Europe and plugged it into an adapter(not a current converter), but this fried the machine due to the 220V vs the 110V in the US. Most devices that have the AC to DC converter plugs also convert current (like cellphone chargers), but this one doesn't"
3,"Great sound machine for 13.99, not 89.95!","I came here to buy a second one of these because I like our first so much. We have used it from day one of life with a new baby (the white noise setting helps her sleep) and wanted another for a different room, but see that the price has gone up drastically. I only paid $13.99 a few months ago. How is it that the price has gone up so much? I would have given this five stars, but now I am only giving it 3 since the price suddenly outdoes the quality."
3,works ok but has flaws,"We've used this product for our daughter for over three years now. It was cheap and can be plugged in or battery-operated so I liked that it was versatile and could be traveled with. However, the machine does have annoying repeating sound clips and the white noise (the one probably most people use) is more like static on a tv than a soothing background noise. Also the volume control is terrible. Just a tiny touch and the volume shoots way up - it's hard to get just right. But, like I said, we've used this every night (and day for naps) for 3 years and it's done the job and still works fine. My daughter sleeps better with it and it does the job of covering any noise in the house going on after she's gone to bed."
4,Sound Spa,I bought this for background sound when we sleep. It is simple to use which is what I wanted. It works very well - turns on and off easily - and does exactly what I wanted....to drown out other noises at night! Great buy!
1,Miserable Experience,This white noise feature has a miserable piercing ring in the background that is quite annoying. The other tones aren't high quality & the volume fluxates with in a chosen tone. Big waste of my money.
2,Sounds great BUT...,"I love the ""thunderstorm"" option that is not usually available on these more affordable models. I was in love with it until it woke me from a sound sleep. Maybe I got a lemon, but mine makes a horrible buzzing noise after about 45 minutes of soothing sound that jars you awake. It's a sound similar to computer speakers buzzing when a cell phone sits too close and has an incomming call.I really wish it didn't do this because it's otherwise a wonderful machine."
4,Conair Sound Machine,"The sound machine was expected, though a little larger than I thought. It has a variety of sounds to choose from. For the as compared to brookstone, I thought it was adequate."
5,conair sound therapy noise maker,Product is exactly what we wanted and needed. Can play for just an hour or as long as you want. Thank you!
4,just what i was looking for,"This was just what I was looking for - something to mask noises and help me fall asleep. The sounds are just a little mechanical at first, but I quickly got used to them."
1,Horrible,I bought this machine because it had so many great reviews. Well I should've listened to the bad ones; I bought this machine for the sould purpose of the white noise. It sounds just like TV static; which I know someone else had listed in their review. It was so annoying within the first few seconds that I turned it off. I don't know how anyone would even be able to fall asleep with this on! I tried the other options and they all sound awful. You get what you pay for; so spend a little bit more money and get something better!
4,Gooed Enough,"I am satisfied with this product. It works fine. My only complaint is that there are so many water sounds and they all sound really similar. A little more variety would have been nice but it still has the crickets and waves breaking, two of my favorites, so I guess its good enough."
1,Cheap but not worth it!,"We had this for two weeks now, me & my husband just can't stand the noise after awhile it's on. It started making an annoying knocking noise or dripping noise. All of the sound are horrible and it sure ain't soothing."
5,Helps baby sleep,Great product. Baby seems to love it. We love that we have the option of using batteries so that we may travel.
3,Just ok,Bought this as we didn't want to use the noise maker ap on cellphones anymore. It worked pretty good at first. But now it makes a buzzing noise after two weeks of use. We think it is because of the monitor being within 5 feet. It is a cheap noise machine. Low quality sounds. But it makes noise so I guess it works.
2,Disappointed.,I ordered this because I have a hard time sleeping. My friend recommended my to try white noise. So I selcted this one and was disappointed the sounds were muffled and I really couldn't sleep then. Sent it back.
1,Broke after six weeks,"I liked this sound machine very much for approximately six weeks, when it simply stopped working. It is about two weeks past the return date, unless I pay for shipping and get only a partial refund. Total waste of money."
1,Ruined a night's sleep for my baby & me,"This was the worst purchase I ever made. I never write reviews but wanted to warn any potential customers off of buying this machine. We had it set to the waterfall and it seemed fine for a few weeks, but then it began periodically making horrible loud static noises that would wake all three of us. You can imagine how unhappy we were to have our baby jolted awake at 10:15 pm, a couple of hours after going down,and then again every few hours throughout the night (we kept it on, as crazy as that sounds, because at that point he'd become dependent on it). My husband is out now buying another kind. Whatever you do, don't purchase this one, no matter how economical it seems. I wish could get my hands on the people who made and marketed it to give them a piece of my mind!"
2,Stopped working after a week,"""You get what you pay for"" is true for this product. I didn't expect the sound quality to be that great (and it was not) but I did expect it to work for at least a year. I shut it off one morning and that night it would not turn on."
2,Developed weird background noise,"I'd say reliability leaves something to be desired. It was OK at first; all sounds were OK for the price ($15 at W-Mart). Then strange repetitive whirring and clicking sounds developed. I'm going to try an exchange first, then will return it if need be. I'd like to try the Sound Oasis S-550 but it appears to have been discontinued. I'm not inclined to spend $90 for Oasis's least expensive model.My 23-year old sound machine is still working nightly, but I wanted a smaller unit for travel."
1,UGLY NOISES!,"So disappointed! The noises on this thing are supposed to be soothing? They were all so artificial and ""tinny"" that I couldn't even stand to have the thing on for more than 10 seconds. There is no way I could sleep with this thing going. Don't waste your money. I've heard really pleasant-sounding sound machines before -- I think the brand is Sonic maybe? But I guess I only wanted to spend the $15, so I got what I paid for, nothing. Will be returned."
2,Some of the sounds are not very realistic,"We have a baby sound spa that has a great ocean wave sound and we were hoping that this Conair device would have a similar quality sound and could play it continuously. Well, the quality of the sounds is not very high. The wave, rain and few other sounds are very muffled and difficult to make out. We're sending it back, very dissapointing."
2,Broke after 1 month,The Conair SU1W Sound machine worked well for the first month. I used it nightly and found it to help me relax. After that month it simply stopped working. I read this on some other reviews as well. I am now ordering a better quality. You get what you pay for.
2,Unusable due to LOUD repeated anomalies,"I understand that this is a cheap unit, and that such units usually have some repeated artifact noises. But this is ridiculous. REALLY loud artifact noises here. Spend a bit more."
5,conair okayyyy,Purchased item for someone who is mentally challenged and blind....great item.....she can hear the different sounds and it is a calming mechanism.
2,Cheap sound and cheaply made.,Cheaply made and cheap sounding. I would buy another brand and spend the extra money for a better sound and a product that is more durable and is aesthetically pleasing.
3,sound machine,"The selection of sounds is good, although a couple of them are very similar and the loops are short. The quality of the sounds could be a little better and occasionally you get a computer like beep."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Unit only made a high squealing sound and then nothing, never worked. Tried both AC adaptor and batteries, nothing worked."
2,Very Short Loops,"Ok, I do like the physical design of this thing. Big buttons, easy to choose different sounds, volume control is big. But the loops are literally about 2 seconds long. I don't understand this because it seems like it would barely cost anything to create longer loops. If you listen to it, it drives you crazy. I use this to help my infant go to sleep. It does work but his parents are driven mad by the loop. Another thing I dislike is that when you turn it off it makes a loud clicking sound and makes the baby stir (although he hasnt woken up from it.) Would be nice if that button was silent and turned the sound off gradually. One more thing I dislike is the brightness of the red ""on"" light."
5,wonderful,Bought it for my daughter and she loves this machines. the multiple sounds you can use are cool. I would recommend this to everyone
2,not great...but cheap,Got this for my 2 month old baby who hates sleep as it was cheap and therefore perfect if not successful. The sound is awful quality but for a baby it MAY be ok. I think an upgrade may be needed to get a sound I can stand hearing. As the volume increases the cheap quality is very evident.Sound apps such as Relax and Sleep are free and sound way better. May just return this ...
3,okay product for the price,"This is a good unit for the price. My only problem is when you turn the sound on a low setting, it crackles- there is an annoying background noise."
2,WRONG ITEM,I WAS GOING TO REVIEW ANOTHER SOUND SPA BUT OPEN REVIEW ON THIS UNIT. I HAVE PURCHASED BUT NOT REC'D THIS SOUND THERAPY
2,Bad Sound,Volume dial does not work well. Must adjust it every couple of hours. Need to adjust it from high to low back and forth until volume comes back. Sucks.
5,Small & convenient!,"This sound machine is small enough to travel with us. When in a hotel it is amazing to me how loud and rude other people are; running up and down the halls. Now, I can sleep!"
4,External hard drivez...,"...a necessity in this era - every teacher, photographer, & activist needs stuff like this. There are more jazzy ones out there, but I got this one at a great price!"
5,Meets the requirements of the job,"Not really much to say in regard to the product. It works, I found when re-installing new valve wiring to an existing sprinkler timer; I needed some valve wire and this was what was needed. Still no problems with the Orbit wire after 5 months."
4,Kate Rusby- Underneath the Stars,"Kate Rusby has the traditional Celtic sound. Her songs vary from simple to complex arrangements in an uplifting tonality. The moods are happy and upbeat, but when they are slow and longing, they do not depress or wax melancholic. Much like the theme of ""Danny Boy"" they express the intensity of feeling for lover and country. Much of contemporary songwriting consists of stream-of-consciousness set to a monotonous chunka-chunka rhythm pattern, usually in some peculiar open tuning. It is encouraging to hear a return to well crafted composition.I purchased both this album and ""The Girl Who Couldn't Fly"" featuring her cover of ""You Belong to Me"" which in my estimation both edifies and challenges the original. If you enjoy a pure powerful voice, and crystal clear production values that honor tradition, these albums are worth it."
3,A Safer Risk Than I Thought,"Much better (for me) that ""Sleepless"" or ""Lights"".Can't change my stars but its her's that matter.I highly recommend the ""Leeds"" DVD with this CD.The ""eloquent melancholia"" which is Kate's is hereless nightmarish than ""Hourglass"" or ""KR-squared"",yet also better balanced.I bought ""Girl"" 3 weeks ago, yet I won't listento it until ""Stars"" has spoken all I can here of her.Sometimes I very much wish some of her audience couldsay *why* her songmaking is special ... play a songand I'm just muted and abashed ..."
2,Short of the WIN,"Like most tough guy hardcore CDs this one is a one trick pony.Uninspired macho mosh parts and fast thrash sections and screaming.Blah blah blah.Buy the new Snapcase or Sick of it All or The Refused.Mushmouth need time to grow and they probably will,but,OUT TO WIN,is a sorry loser."
2,"The compositions are probably good, but the recording quality is abysmal","My wife and I own and very much enjoy another CD collection of Christmas Carols for solo piano by Jim Gibson, so we ordered this one too. The problem is, the recording quality of this second CD (from the same record label) is so atrocious that I can't even listen to it. It sounds like there's a muddy, muffling film over the sound. And while I don't know if this is due to a glitch in the particular CD we received or if the whole batch is bad, but I do the one have is of such poor recording quality that I find it unbearable."
5,It works,"I bought this book & read it over several times. When I preformed the first ritual, I had immediate results. I could detect the presence of a small dragon.I am more than convinced that dragons exist. I have caused storms with the help of the dragons (no one was even close to being hurt) & have gotten my way in most things.If you are planning on summoning dragons for binding or black magick, don't even bother buying this book. You will be severly punished for binding a dragon. As for black magick, it will come back to you. I say this from personal expirience. No, I've never been a satanist. I have attempted to punish people I don't like, but it was unjust so I was punished.Dragons are powerful aids in magick. Treat them with respect & you will be rewarded. Try to abuse or control them, & you will die."
3,Dragon Wicca 101,"I was attracted to this book because of the artwork and because of a love of/fascination with dragons... however, I was rather disappointed.I found the first couple of chapters about the history of dragons to be interesting. But once it got to the rituals I couldn't help thinking this was yet another Wicca 101 rewrite of every other book she's written - with dragon names thrown in where she would put an element in one book, of a Celtic god in another.I found most of the book to be useless clap-trap... with the odd sprinkling of useful or interesting information here and there. Probably the only reason I have any affinity for Conway at all is because she places sword in fire and wand for air as I do - tho I find the tools generally unnecessary.I will say I did buy the Celtic Dragon tarot deck she was involved in... but mostly just because the art is fantastic."
4,Good for dragon lore & mythology,"I totally attracted to the cover & bought the book at a local store. The first couple of chapters on dragon mythology is absolutely great, except for tiny little mistakes about Oriental dragons (I should know, I'm from the Orient & Chinese). The rituals brought forth were interesting & I can't wait to try them out in my regular rituals, but some of the things, like the incense list is common in other witchcraft/wicca/pagan books. Overall, the book makes for excellent reading and does present some very interesting ideas for rituals and sources of power."
5,great values,my daughter has every one of the Land Before Time movies. she wants to watch them over and over. they teach respect and value of family and friends.
5,C'est super cute,"allo, je trouve sa vraiment plate que la langue de Land Before Time sa juste en anglais sa serai bien plus le fun si il saurai en francais aussi et vous aurriez beaoucp plus dacheteur"
1,boring lost of intrest,lost intrest in movie in the first 10 min.slow moving and never pulled me back in to it.
5,loved it,"Great movie, very interesting, there is comedy, suspense, romance, action. Everyone will find something to like in this. I watched it several times."
5,Great movie!,"I really love this movie. It has mystery, adventure, action and all without being bloody or including profanity - what is there not to love!"
4,Inkheart,This movie is a great fantasy movie. Might be a little hard to follow for younger children. I don't remember any bad language in this movie.
3,OK,"Fraiser is good child very good, story kind of funky but his movie.k.s tend to be that way. Effects descent story really funky but o.k..."
5,as expected,This came very fast and new as expected. good condition even a hand written thank you that was appreciated! I will order from this vendor again if i get the chance.
3,A decent adaptation of the book,"Although I didn't really like the book, I actually enjoyed the movie. I was expecting the same far too long escape and recapture scenes between Mo and Capricorn, many of which were still there but significantly shortened. There were plenty of changes to the movie, especially at the end, but overall, I think they were an improvement to the original story. My favorite aspects, however, were the camera effects and the soundtrack.-Lindsey Miller, www.lindseyslibrary.com"
4,Inkheart needed more ink,"I think that this movie did a good job at its purpose which is to entertain. I would have liked more understanding as to the ""Whys"" and ""Hows"" of things, and I believe that the movie could have been longer with more depth. Do not try to tell me that the Fantasy Movies for kids need to be 90 minutes. Look at the Harry Potter series, all hitting about 2 hours a pop. If the movie is engaging, length and depth are not an issue. Still, this was entertaining and enjoyable for the family from a group that did not read the book before hand. And the bonus feature of the actress reading a chapter not even in the movie? that was a waste of space in my opinion."
4,Inkheart the movie,The movie is very good. Does a good job of following along with the book. The book series is great too!
2,Doesn't last,Worked good for a year then wouldn't shut off. I took it apart and the metal spring inside was rusted and falling apart. Clearly made of cheap metal.
1,Lasts about 4 month with minimal use,"I have purchased 2 of these over the last year from Amazon. The patterns are great, but the valve handles are terrible. After 3 month of minimal use, cheap plastic trigger stretches, enlarges, moves all over, making use nearly impossible. Consider that I remove it and place in garage after every use. Never left outside."
2,Broke after 1 day of use,"When I first used the nozzle I was very impressed. Good quality, nice variety of spray patterns, and easy on the hands. However later in the day I noticed that the metal clip which holds the spray nozzle on for constant pressure had fallen off. I was unable to locate the metal clip and now my nozzle does not have the constant spray feature which I would like to use. This is common for since these things down last forever, however I didn't expect for it to break off during the first day of usage. I have a picture if anyone would like to see but Amazon won't allow pics to be upload (only videos - fail)."
3,Does the job.,"This is a pretty good hose spray for what you're paying. It has 7 available patterns but you'll probably just use three (Jet, Full and Shower). One big problem with this spray is that the nut that attaches to the rod is made of cheap plastic. If you just drop it on the nut, it will crack. So save yourself the trouble and replace the nut with a metal one before you use this hose. Other than that, there's not much to complain about."
1,BUSTED!,"Item worked great for two weeks, until...We had been using it regularly ten to fifteen minutes a day and it worked great. Then we used it for a few hours off an on. Off an on. Leaving the water on between uses. The gasket blew. We took it apart and replaced the ""O"" ring to it's proper position and then it blew again. This time the plastic interior stripped right past the screws. We would not recommend this unless you have a pressure regulator or use it lightly, very lightly. Would not purchase again. We got what we paid for, unfortunately."
1,Orbit Hose Nozzle,Cheap plastic construction and uncomfortable handle. There are much better models out there such as the all metal Dramm 12705 Revolver 9-Pattern Pistol Hose Spray Nozzle with the comfort handle -- much better. It does provide a cheap back-up if the other nozzle breaks.
3,Only lasted 3 months.,I guess since it is made in plastic that i should have expected the nozzle to last long. The nozzle broke after normal use in 3 months.
1,typical DK book,Pretty picture as in all DK books but gives an entire overview of all acrylic paining in 72 pages. A lot of simple paragraph definitions of techniques but nothing of any direction or use for a begining painter. A great picture book for a child.
4,"Good Book, Not Great Book","Considering that I have yet to find a complete compedium of Acrylic techniques, this is probably one of the better books out there, especially for beginners. This book will give you the short and skinny on your tools, paint and mediums, and canvases/surfaces. After that, the book starts giving examples on how to tranfer your image onto the canvas with pencil prior to painting, using opaque methods to painting, transparent(watercolor style) methods, drybrushing, scumbling, and more. Then at the end of the book, it contains a series of gallry examples in acrylic to inspire. This book is a good foundation book, and gives many approaches to using acrylic."
4,Just what a beginner needs,"I found this book to be just what I needed to get started with acrylics. It is concise, yet has all that a beginner needs to know what to buy and how to get started. I found the simple exercises very helpful and look forward to trying the more complex techniques as I gain confidence."
3,It's just okay. Wasn't too impressed. Doesn't too helpful.,The book wasn't as informative as I wanted it to be. So far I don't feel confident I can paint correctly. I already messed up a painting and referring to the book has not inspired much. Best to search for other books.
1,What you see isn't what you get!,"Because of a poor design, it is next to impossible to put cups in the dispenser and then retrieve them. Esthetically, it looks lovely but it doesn't serve the purpose of giving us cups when needed."
1,Not a good product......Poor design,"This product was sold as a set with the mouthwash dispenser, and the finishes are different. It only holds a few cups, which are extremely difficult to load. The unit is all one piece, which requires that you cram the cups in from the top, which causes them to crush and tear.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
3,cup holder,matches well with my fixtures a little difficult to remove or replace cups. I wish the top came off.
3,Not what I was expecting.,"I loved the first book on Roselynde and fell in love with Simon and Alinor. In fact, when I finished late in the night ,I couldn't wait to start Alinor and immediately went to Amazon to make my purchase on my Kindle. Unfortunately, I hadn't read what the book was about and from the ending in Roselynde, I their relationship would continue...but..No. Simon died! I was so disappointed and found it very hard to transition from one book with a beautiful relationship to suddenly having Alinor a widow and someone new come into her life. If fact, I didn't finish the book. Sad.Roberta Gellis is a wonderful writer despite my disappointment with this book. It was more the story line rather than her writing. She's a beautiful story teller and I will most definitely read her books again."
4,Here are the track titles,"1. I Just want to be with you2. Rain3. End of the summer4. Endless Nights5. Another Saturday - Let it be me6 Samarkand Blue7. River of love8. Sol y sombra9. Rainy blue10. Please don't you cry11. Suddenly12. Circle of lifeMost of the songs reflect the words ""English lyrics by P. Coolidge (Priscilla?) and most of the music writers' names are Japanese. River of Love and Circle of Light credit Rita and Priscilla as writers. Rosemary Butler and Priscilla are singing background vocals. I have only listened to it once and nothing has ""blown me away"" but it's beautiful Rita's quiet style and I'm sure with repeated listenings I will be charmed. I'm thrilled to own it."
3,"Good, but there is better for the same price - try PowerBible CD","The PowerBible CD is much better and is actually cheaper since they give you two copies for the same price. In terms of the lower-end programs, the PowerBible is the best. I am blessed to also have PC Study Bible, but this is harder to use and not as friendly as either of these."
3,Bible CD,"I have not had the time to familiarize myself completely with this program, however, my initials usages have had good results. I believe it to be satisfactory in terms of reference for those who want to have specific queries of the bible"
4,Very useful,My daughter has enjoyed using this book. It seems to actually be teaching her something about drawing.
5,A wonderful book for those who grew up with The Great Brain,"After my husband finished reading the Great Brain books to my stepson, I decided to find out more about John D. Fitzgerald, and to my surprise, I found that he had published this memoir that was aimed at adults (actually the Great Brain books weren't really intended for kids specifically). This books includes a lot of details of his growing up that are left out of the Great Brain books - like the fact that he has a sister, and the fact that Mamma is a Mormon, and that they let their kids decide which faith to follow. Sweyn, John, and their sister become Catholics, but Tom, became a Mormon. It includes the courtship between Papa and Mamma, and it takes you through until their old age. I highly recommend reading this book - it's got lots of laughs, joy, and even tears."
4,Pretty amazing,"Seems like a real fireplace, purchased for sons girlfriend and looks great on the HD TV set she has in her apartment"
4,rough and nice,The reviews are mixed. What I think is that Tom Hawkins plays the guitar like someone who is used to playing outdoors where it is necessary to use the right hand in such a way as to raise the volume of the guitar. It is possible that he is playing a flamenco guitar. So he plays a bit rough (and there is plenty of fret noise) but with passion and energy. I like this roughness which you also hear in Tango guitarists like Anibal Arias. The mix of modern and classical music is attractive and in each piece you can hear who is playing. I like this CD a lot.
1,Slouching towards mediocrity,"I was given this CD as a gift; I do not wish to offend the well-meaning gift-giver, so I have chosen to remain anonymous. As a musician, I suppose I listened to this collection more critically than did the other reviewers on this page, but I cannot claim that it is anything more than a posturing, pseudo-pluralistic attempt at appealing to a middlebrow audience. If you have a healthy imagination and an appreciation for melodic nuance, then this CD is not for you."
5,Simply put:,"This disc is hot. Basically on some nostalgic type of hip-hop stuff like MF Doom's ""Operation Doomsday"" or ""People Under the Stairs."" Actually everything from the Bru crew is dope."
5,POPgressive rock at its best!,"Alan parsons project have always reminded me of a lighter less dark pink floyd. No suprise considering that alan parson worked on Dark side of the moon with the floyd. This is a superb collection of APP music spanning there entire career. APP usually had conceptualy based albums, rather it was over use of electronic surveliance (I Robot) or gambling addiction (Turn of a friendly card). They walked a fine line between pop and progressive rock to create a more radio friendly body of work than lets say a band like yes did. There is no shortage of great music to find on this generous double disk set. The brilliant vocal work of eric woolfsen on tracks like Eye in the sky the disco funk swagger of I wouldnt want to be like you and the early 80s radio anthems like Games people play leave listeners with a collection of songs to be treasured."
4,"Great watch, band snaps rather easily","Great, good-looking watch. I ended up on this page because I'm looking for a replacement band, since it gets brittle and breaks over time as you take it on/off. As usual, Fossil is of little help in replacing only the band, but they'll let you send it back for ""repairs"" for [...]"
5,Excellent Product!,I bought this barbecue tool set for my son in law and he just LOVES it! It's very attractive and sleek...perfect for those yuppies who want all the latest and greatest. It's a brand name I trusted and I think it was a heck of a deal for the money.
4,Cool tools,These tools are functional and are priced competitively with those of big box stores. The tongs work well arranging the hot briquets without cooking fingers.
5,These will last forever,I bought these in 2005 and 8 years later they still look good as new. They are nice and long so you don't have to get too close to the heat. Great buy!
3,Great shoes! but not in gold...,Great great shoes! fit absolutely right! Look just fantastic! but in black... gold is not a right color
3,There are alternatives for thinking people,Good personal stories included in this book.However he gives little voice to recovery programs other than 12 step programs like AA.
2,"Basically an intro to AA, with some testimonials","Because of the title and other factors I was expecting a non-religious approach to alcoholism. But that is not what this book is. It is the story of one guy who didn't think he could possibly be an alcoholic, and how after some ups and downs discovered that he wanted to stop drinking and found great value in AA. He avoids discussing Christianity but a big part of his story is his improved relationship with what he calls God.In other words, reading this book is a lot like just going to an AA meeting, where people every day tell the same story. As such, the book has value in the same way AA has value. And on those terms it is moderately useful, even including chapters in which some third parties tell their drinking stories, just like in AA. But in terms of rationality, this is no more a ""thinking person's"" book than any other. If you're looking for a secular book on alcohol recovery, keep looking."
2,A blatant pitch for AA,"If you wonder whether your drinking behavior is appropriate or dangerous, this book will provide a few cues to help you decide if you should moderate your drinking or quit altogether.That said, the author is, by his own hearty admission, a hardcore member of Alcoholics Anonymous. (For those not aware, Alcoholics Anonymous is a religious cult that purports to be a treatment program, but in fact has an abstinence success rate approaching two percent -- by its own admission, no less.) Most of this book is devoted to selling AA to the reader, with wonderful and inspiring stories that may or may not be true. They're probably about as true as anything else you'd hear at an AA meeting.If you choose to read this book, be sure to read Ken Ragge's The Real AA and Chas Bufe's Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Cure? to be sure you receive a balanced account."
5,Enigma meets jazz meets traditional Tibetan music,"If Enigma had used traditional Tibetan music and jazz as their influences on their first CD, as opposed to Middle Eastern music and Gregorian chants (and the sound of a woman breathing heavily), it would have sounded a lot like this. Also very reminiscent of Delerium's ""Semantic Spaces"", but with a personality all its own."
4,Good one,"This is the sharpener that is issued by various military services throughout the world, and this is for good reason - it works very well to keep a good edge on a service knife or bayonet. It isn't for getting a good edge on a new knife, so it won't do a good job, but once the edge is there, this honing stone will keep it there. I have used these types of stones for many years with very good results."
3,A little too small,This thing is way too small to sharpen anything with any size. its okay for pocket knives or something real small.
2,Too small for large knifes,"This is very small, this can be kept on your Key chain it is so small. your not going to use this to sharpen a hunting knife. Works well for your pocket knife. I was never in the military so I can't tell you if this is really G.I but I can't imagine this being given to a soldier. LoL"
5,RARE TREAT! Glorious history of the Silver Screen!,"Doesn't leave out any of the gory details. Very informative. The author is very intelligent, likeable and has a great sense of humor. Fabulous writer. I only wish she had written more books."
1,Failed - stuck open!,"I was using this valve to auto-fill a water tank and it died after 5 cycles of on for 2 hours, off for 24.Worse, I'd have had a very wet garage if I hadn't been watching this fill cycle -- it failed stuck open, filling the tank even without 24v applied to it. Garbage."
1,Makes my dogs sick,"I thought this product would help my dog with digestion problems. She has a sensitive stomach and has previously benefited from enzymes and probiotics. Instead it made my dog cough and vomit. Even my other dog, who is less sensitive, vomited from this product. I do not know how to get a refund, but I wish I could."
2,disapointed,"I'm a Isshinryu practiitioner and was looking forward to learning things about my styles past. I was disapointed. The book has poor editing and lacks flow. some paragraphs reapeat what was said just above them. The author talks about how Isshinryu has become watered down but does not really address these differences. The author also talks says that Shimabuku helped train soldiers in the vietnam war, but does not talk about the martial training. I did enjoy the old pictures.Overall I would recomend that if you want to purchace this book wait until a used copy comes available. Don't pay full price."
5,The Bubba Gump Shrimp Co Cookbook,"I recently dined in Anaheim, California's Bubba Gump Restaurant and was so happy to find that Amazon had the cookbook. I have already used it several times and will use it in my high school ProStart (culinary) classes that I teach, too. The photos and quotes are priceless."
2,Hoover (when it sucks it's good),"We've had a Windtunnel model now for a year (Mach 6.9) I think is the generic model. When it's working well it's great and it really does pick up everything. But the engineering behind this model leaves a lot to be desired. We use it about 1-2 times a week on a 2000 sq. ft. house. How does replacing two belts every 4-6 months sound, or replacing the brush roller two times in a year not to mention an idler pulley? Why? After awhile, the belts start to slip I suspect due to sloppy tolerances on expanding plastic. Once that begins the roller brush won't pick-up anything. We bought it from Kohls but after taking it back to an authentic Hoover dealer, the owner told me this is a common problem due to the cheap plastic they use. Once the belt starts slipping plan on buying new belts and a roller for about $ each time. I should have never thrown out my old-fashioned heavy metal cleaner."
1,A Year Later - We are Still Paying,"My first few months with the vacuum, I thought it was excellent. However over these past 2 months we have had continuous trouble with it picking up anything. Afer cleaning the roller, we took it in to have it repaired and there were 10 other models that looked just like mine sitting there. After $65 we found out that the belts were already worn and because the frame is made of plastic and not metal, the problems are only going to increase. Ultimately because the plastic continues to heat up so dramatically, the motor will burn out. Hopefully others have not had the problems we have experienced. It is my recommendation that before you purchase the vacuum, speak to someone who works on them or has no vested interest in your purchase to see if what I am saying is correct. My experience, we had a $125 Sharp Vacuum with a metal frame that lasted us over 10 years without 1 repair. We purchased this $300 Hoover and it hasn't lasted 18 months."
5,Wonderful!,I have long been a fan of Ana Castillo's work; this venture into the world of younger readers is powerful and haunting. A wonderful addition to anyone's library.
3,Limited Weight,"I may be foolish but I tried to stick some slabs of ribs on this guy and they turned out to be too heavy and the spit wouldn't turn. The total weight was about 9 pounds. I thought it would handle them but no luck. On a more positive note, the construction of this rotisserie is fantastic. Every part is beautifully made and very nicely finished. Pop it into a dishwasher and it cleans up nicely. Spray sonme oil on the baskets to ease cleanup."
3,not used very often,This item is very hard to clean. We've only used it once because of all the effort it takes to cleanup.
3,The product needs approximately 3 weeks to work. ...,The product needs approximately 3 weeks to work. After one week of use there wasn't a dramatic difference in the nail. I'll continue to use the product and hope the results will intensify. The product was fairly easy to use but you do need a little time to do it. Nighttime seems to be the easiest time.
3,A decent portrayal of the legend,"The Capture of Bigfoot is a decent portrayal of how a Bigfoot/hominid-type creature would react if its offspring were kidnapped by humans.The movie had great winter scenery and had several suspenseful moments as the stars rambled through the snow and had encounters with the mammoth creature.These creatures are normally shy and avoid humans, but when hurt, provoked or an offspring is harmed or stolen, look out!"
2,Can't put chapters on repeat,"The images are lovely - but what I wanted was a fake aquarium. The way the disc is set up, I cannot get the disc to respond to the ""repeat"" chapter command. It's incredibly irritating. After 15 or 20 minutes, the disc cycles to the next aquarium. Not the effect I was looking for."
2,Home made swill,The HD effects are not there...we are living in the stone age of HD quality production and this Blu ray disc is a slap in the face.They say right on the cover Ultra sharp 1080p....I can watch 1960's movies with 10 times higher resolution then what this crummy thing has to offer.It is a big disappointment. The con artists put it on a blu ray disc giving you the false impression its genuine HD...it ain't.This is like a movie you by from a bootlegger off the street. Homemade koolaid swill.
4,Works great!!!,My old school waffle iron finally bit the dust. I have been through 3 new ones and none of them made the good old crispy standard waffles that I was used to until this machine. I would definitely buy this again. My family is very happy!!!
4,"Good Mattress, Great Storage System","This is a good mattress for the price, pretty comfortable. The best thing about it is the ""Wrap 'N' Roll"" storage idea! I've always hated folding up air mattresses and trying to get them back in their bags, it seems to almost never fit the first time. This, though, is entirely different. Not only does it have the instructions attached, so someone who didn't set the bed up can still take it down, but if you miss-fold it, it still works. If you are tight on time, like trying to leave a campsite in a thunderstorm, you don't even really need to do more than fold it in half, roll it up, and tie the ends. Love it Coleman, finally some innovation to get us away from the age old storage bag."
1,"Used about 10 times, then leaked at a mold seal","Leaked till flat on the hard, cold, tent floor middl eof the night, of course. After reading more recent reviews here I think these latest models have some issues. I would buy another brand. Until it leaked though it was a great alternative to theramrests for car campling, but 10 times use is a waste of time and materials. We also tried to reapir the leak without success."
3,deflated after 6 mos,"and it was replaced by the company. found another mattress called Ozark trail and it has been much more durable. real mattresses get dust mites but plastic mattresses are easily cleaned, are light weight, inexpensive and much better than the old cloth mattresses. I don't weigh much so am very happy with air mattresses."
1,A big loser!!!!,"This bed loses air the first time you use it. Even if the valves are tight and secure. It was comfortable when it was inflated, but when you wake up in the middle of the night sleeping on the floor, or ground it isn't very comfortable. Try another brand."
1,Dumb Bratz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"In my opion they shoud stop making bratz and make more my scenecuz helloooooooooo look at there name i mean bratz thats exatly what they are sluty bratz! I DO NOT know why peopletalk about my scene,bratz dress alot more sluty then my scene.my scene might look sexy but they look beautiful bratz look sexy and ugly,dumb,and retarted.my scene look so beatiful that I want people to buy them and enjoy them thats what there for and to make you feel prettyps.thank you mettel for making my scene"
2,Tess and Nona?,Angel and Devil how come they made these insted?Bye Bye Tess and Nona.Jezee Manese!!!!!!!!!Phoebe and Roxxi Rock this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Adorable and Sassy!!,"I don't have these dolls(yet)but by the picture I can tell they are super adorable!! I can't wait until my b-day so I can get them! I acually hate dolls and girly things, but this is an acception. Roxxi is my faveorite, she's a punk ""bad girl"" but Pheobe is cute too. And since I'm getting them, I'm also going to get all the other bratz babyz.I totally recomend this doll!!"
5,Astounding,"Thomas Craughwell is the brilliant maestro conducting his symphony of tales of a friend's friend. Mr Craughwell has outdone himself with another installment in the increasingly popular series of books on urban legends. He has the passion and heart that many authors of today lack. He plungs into the deep caverns of the darkness of the human psycke with the tales ""Back From The Dead"" and ""Royal African Millionaires Neep Your Help!"" His other works provided meaningful and thought comments on socio-economic problems as well as his own quaint philosophies. ""Saints For Every Occasion,"" the ""50 States Fandex,"" and the ""Book Lover's Page-a-Day Calender"" all give the reader an incredible insight into the mind that is Thomas J Craughwell."
2,Not enough oomph,"Bought this pump to use for inflating an air mattress, but ended up having to buy a different pump because this one just couldn't get enough output to inflate the mattress completely. It took forever to fill, and still left the mattress feeling squishy."
3,Too weak to finish the job,"I've had this pump for several years now and it can never inflate the mattress to a comfortable firmness. Even after 10 minutes on fresh batteries your bum will hit the ground when lie down. So, you'll still need a manual or just get a more powerful pump.Given the weakness, its still beats having the inflate the mattress with the manual pump. So 5 minutes with this pump and a minute with the manual pump is enough to get the right firmness."
1,DOES NOT DO THE JOB,Every time I've bought a Coleman air mattress I've had to buy a separate pump. The rechargeable pump works well when you are away from an outlet. The one you plug in works great when you're at home.DO NOT BUY THIS 4D PUMP.It takes an hour and your mattress is not even firm. Ridiculous waste of money and D batteries.
2,Poor performance,"We just used this pump for the first time on a weekend camping trip.I purchased 4 new ""D"" batteries - the pump just doesn't spit out enough air. It took forever to get the mattress 70% filled up and we sat there for about 10 more minutes trying to fill the rest of the way and it just wouldn't go. I am disappointed. We camped with some friends last year who had a similar product from coleman (batter-operated pump) and theirs worked great (on batteries that were not brand new). They said they bought theirs about 12 years ago. I think the quality in the Coleman brand has gone down. :( I do intend to give them another try and I'll purchase their rechargeable version next..."
5,Secretly Multi Purpose Pump,"Great little pump, plenty of power to air up the whole camp in one go. Secret bonus about this little gem, when you are trying to get a campfire started, use this as your bellows to blow air into the fire and watch the barn burner start! I got a fire started in the rain last year with this thing!"
4,Does the job,"but takes a little bit of time. It was to be expected because it runs on batteries. I wish it came with more attachments so you could use this pump on anything. Floats, airbeds, etc.Easy to use and ready on the go!"
3,Dragonstar,"Perhaps my disappointment with this book relates to how much I loved its prequels. Compared to the harrowing, boundary-shattering qualities of Dragonshadow and Knight of the Demon Queen, this is weak stuff. It's very much not a stand-alone novel, and the themes and character developments are simply recap of what we've seen before. It's the end of the series, and so it's all about wrapping up plot threads, but some of the resolutions are disappointing--in particular that with Aohila. Other plot elements seem forced and, though of cosmic scale, lacking in emotional impact. Things just sort of...resolve. Tension is lacking.As a side point, the copy editing is incompetent, with a misspelling appearing in the very first sentence.It's not all bad, though. If you take this book as a second half of Knight, an anodyne, it works better. Hambly continues to write about engaging characters, to use gorgeous language, and to ground her settings strongly in material culture."
5,The Ending Has It,"I shall be brief. I saw this yesterday on TCM by chance. Never heard of it. I was entranced from the start. Others have reviewed the acting,stylings of the sets,beauty of the heroine,restoration quality, BUT the final words and scene yelled out from the screen to the viewer at the awesome power of Sven . It grabbed me and I was in a mild trance, hypnotized at the daring demands by Sven to the heavens. Now THAT is star power and made this a movie for all ages.So I purchased the dvd."
5,Great Quick Reference Book,"Have loved this book over the last 2 years and continue to use it as a quick and concise reference for unusual Dxs, injuries, special tests or review. My clinical students have enjoyed it too. Good video of upper limb tension tests. Think it is well worth the price."
3,Boy I am getting lazy. Jetsons here I come.,This brush is good. I don't know how it compares with other power brushes but my teeth feel clean when done. The whole family has been enjoying it. A big plus is it is a little easier to get my son into brush his teeth. The big drawback at the moment is I can't find replacement brushes.
2,It is possesed,I bought this tooth brush before Christmas. It does work ok. We had major problems with it staying on when we brushed and staying OFF while we slept. We are convinced that this tooth brush is possesed. It turns itself on and off at its whim. I had to throw it away. For $9.99 you could give it a try.
5,Hillsong Utd - Look to You review,"I love the digital age because you don't have to purchase a whole CD to get 2 good songs. However no need to worry on this album - digital or physical, you'll want the whole thing! Rarely do I encounter an album where a majority of the songs are good - let alone where every one is. Each and every song on this album is a masterpiece, from the title track ""Look To You"" to the United version of Awesome God. I highly recommend it - you won't be disappointed (I've had this album for a few years now, and I haven't tired of it)."
5,Up and coming Author!!,"Leisha Kelly has written another winner! A book about the depression (1929), human compassion and help for others. It is one of the best books I have read (and I read many). The characters (children too) each have their own personalities. The lives of Julia and Samuel continue and they continue to survive the depression although it is hard and also help others. Will not get into the story - it's too good. Don't want to spoil a great book for you."
4,stink-b-gone,"Bought these for my brother (his wife asked for them!) and he said they worked well. He did like the spray powder by Dr. Scholl's better, though. Maybe the powder was more fun to use."
1,As comforting as a jack hammer . . . . .,"What a waste of money! After a busy day chasing my twin toddler boys around, I looked so forward to a nice relaxing soak in the tub with my new pillow. Wrong! It didn't stick well to the tub or stay in place. It hurt my neck and the vibration was WAY too much. This ... was too uncomfortable to even use with the shaking and quaking turned off. Just terrible - it went in the trash can."
1,I didn't like this product at all. I ...,"I didn't like this product at all. I chose it because I have leg pain a lot, and I though this would help improve it. The first day was ok -- they hurt my heels some, but not too bad. The second day, they hurt my feet and my heels. I decided to try to keep wearing them, thinking that maybe they had to be broken in. After about five days of wearing them, my legs and feet hurt worse than they did before. I know the result was supposed to be the exact opposite -- but unfortunately it wasn't."
3,Seam down the center,"I am someone who uses canvas dropcloths as tablecloths. (There are a million ideas for this on Pinterest-I keep mine pretty simple.) This drop cloth has a HUGE seam down the center. But, as a drop cloth, it works just fine!"
2,Typical white boy pollution,"Blues from new york? Uh, you get what you pay for. If you like amature white boy hour then this is the CD for you."
1,Destroyed with one use!,"I bought these insoles because I wear a lot of my flats and sandals without socks which results in odor and discomfort if my feet sweat. At first these insoles felt great, offered some comfort and seemed to work really well. I wore a pair of my shoes with these insoles without socks for about six hours and could start to feel the insoles falling apart. By the time I made it through one work day (of mostly sitting and occasional walking around the office) the insoles were completely destroyed and unusable. i had to pull them out of the shoes after one use. They worked great to stop odor and felt great except that they don't last more than a day :("
1,Don't be fooled by flashy look,"Spend more money to get something better. This unit broke after 4 uses. No power, nothing. Their 2-year warantee requires I pay to ship it to Homedics AND give them a check for 5 dollars so they can ship it back. I rather give my money to a reputable company, and suggest you look at Wahl."
3,It's OK. Just know what you're getting.,"I was under the impression when I ordered this that it was an ordinary book you could read straight through. It's actually more of a general reference book of math history, organized in subtopics with really tiny, dense print written with little flair."
1,Toxic Air Mattress,"I bought this mattress for my 3 year old granddaughter and me to sleep on at a family gathering. My pregnant daughter set it up and she and my 2 year old granddaughter slept next to us. Strong fumes coming from the mattress woke us up during the night. The baby moved off the mattress and slept elsewhere in the room. The next morning I read the fine print on the bottom of the box. It warned that this bed could cause cancer, birth defects, and reproductive harm. Made in China. I called Coleman and talked to someone who wouldn't comment on my situation but said that someone from the company would call me within the half hour. No one called."
1,Bed isn't firm & loses air easily,"This mattress doesn't pump up to be very firm - after a minute or so, the battery operated pump gets really loud and seems to lack the strenght to pump enough air into the mattress for it to be more than medium-soft.The first time I used this is deflated quite a bit overnight. I'm not at all impressed with the quality and plan to return mine."
4,clean,"the packaging and cd itself are that of a brand new item, and the sound quality in the cd is excellent."
3,Stains socks black,"These work great for stopping foot odor.But, they stained my white socks black for the first month of using them.I would advise buying odor eaters with white inserts if you wear white socks."
4,This product worked great! I put them in ...,"This product worked great! I put them in my sneakers and they helped get rid of any foot smell! The only couple of drawbacks -- you have to cut them down to size yourself, and they're obvious. Also, I don't think they fit perfectly, so if your feet are really sensitive, they might be uncomfortable. But they're really wonderful for odor elimination!"
4,Inspirational movie but falls short in one area,This movie is both entertaining and inspirational. I find it to be accurate in terms of Biblical Prophecy. This movie was intended to do more than entertain; It was also intendend to spread the Gospel and particularly to inform those who do not know Christ as their saviour that a time is comming of great tribulation to those without salvation. The single flaw I find in this movie is that the message of salvation is weak. The very core of the message is watered down. It is not incorrect but I beleive it is incomplete. More detail on salvation could have been given as presented in the audio tape.
2,"Disappointing, but not a total waste","Like most movies, it's not as good as the book. I think it differs from the book in a couple of major areas such as one of the main characters, Buck Williams, in the movie was a T.V. reporter but in the book was a newspaper reporter, which I thought made him less recognizable when it came to later plotlines in the series. The movie also was less subtle about the main characters coming to Christ, and realizing what actually happened to those left behind. Some of the acting was a little bland.I will admit I did find the DVD somewhat entertaining, and I might have liked it even more if I didn't read the books first. Overall I would suggest watching it, not expecting too much, before buying it."
1,Bleh.... I wasted a netflix credit on this?,"Bleh, now that I've read seven books in this series I decided to rent the film. All I can say is this was super cheesy. Kirk Cameron's acting was so bad, now every time I read the books I'll think of Buck as being an aging child star with a bad perm.Chloe the 'surprisingly adult' young woman in the novels has been reduced to a whining woman with an unfashionable nose ring which doesn't suit her face. At least get the woman a nostril stud.I waded through the first 30 minutes of peachiness and bad CGI before returning this film. What a waste of time. Read the books. They are much better."
1,El Crapola,"Ok, let's be honest here, the movie was crapola. It took me three days to watch it and I fell asleep twice. The only reason I put myself through such boredom was because the book was so good. If I had not read the book first I would have never subjected myself through that painfully agonizing boring film. Forget the movie and read the book. Shoot, read the whole series, it is great."
1,A waste of time and money,"I have read the first few books in this series, and while I kept in mind that the book is almost always better than the movie, the curiosity got the best of me and I rented it. All I can say is, I wish I never spent money to rent this movie, it was so bad that I had to turn it off less than half way through. The most disappointing was that there were way too many differences with the book. If you read the books, don't waste your money on this movie."
2,Left Behind: The Movie,"I was sooo looking forward to this, but when it came out, I was very disapointed. The books are really exciting and I didn't find that same quality with the movie. I had pictured the characters quite differently than in the movie and I didn't like the changes they made to the storyline. I think if you never read the series, it might be good, but once you've read the books, it's like someone has changed the members of your family! I have all of the audio tapes in the drama series and they are totally awesome! I guess I'll keep listening to them and skip the videos."
1,Get the Audio Dramas Instead!!!!!,"I saw this movie and couldn't believe how far they strayed from the Book. Kirk Cameron and his lady, along with the rest og the cast, are all fine actors.....but this movie was a yawner, and though I really hoped it would be supported well, I couldn't bring myself to recommend it to anyone. My opinion is that anyone interested in dramatization of LEFT BEHIND should get the Audio Dramas on CD (the ones produced by Gap Digital). They are FAR better than this movie..."
2,Please Read the Books!,"Having read most of the Left Behind series before seeing this movie, I was not expecting the movie to be even close to them in quality. I was very right. This movie didn't hold my attention, the acting was not very good, the special effects weren't that great either. The actors never really convey the fear that a person would surely feel at the events going on around them. That being said, I do believe in the Rapture the way that it is portrayed in the movie. If a person wanted to learn more about it or just wanted an entertaining read, the books are the way to go. I just hope a lesson was learned from the making of this movie. If they want to make more movies based on the Left Behind series, Please Make Them Good!"
2,No Contest,"Here is a case in which the only common denominator between the movie and the book is the title. I was VERY disappointed in the film. The book was exciting, interesting, informative and could hold one's interest even if you read it in one sitting. The film lacked realism and, at times, was even boring. I have purchased the book as a gift for at least a dozen friends but would not even consider giving anyone this video."
2,So much unrealized potential...,"Left Behind was one of the most amazing books I have ever read. What was so amazing about it was that it was Christian and yet it was still QUALITY. I cannot say the same for the film. The film tries HARD but misses the mark. Kirk Cameron puts in a decent performance as Buck Williams and Chloe is also played well.... but Rayford Steele? Who is this guy? It is one of the WORST performances I have ever seen in my life. I laughed out loud as he delivered some of his lines. For someone who was supposed to have just met the Creator of heaven and earth, he was surprisingly stoic...I could go on... but why? The filmmakers tried. It wasn't a complete waste, but if you haven't read the book, prepare to be LOST. They crammed 400 pages into 95 minutes... I gave them two stars for trying. Just because something is Christian doesn't mean it's quality."
4,Can't Wait to See What's Next...,"Being a fan of the Left Behind book series, I was naturally thrilled to hear that plans were being made to bring the story to film. As I read the books, I could visualize the story, and the characters became all the more real and personal to me. The film has brought these characters completely to life.Watching this film was like reliving the experience of old friends. It was interesting to me, knowing how future events were going to affect these characters, watching them introduced on film for the first time. From the sight of planes exploding midair over Israel, to Buck's first prayer before the meeting with Nicolae, I found the movie to be both touching and thought-provoking. Even if you don't believe in God, or in Christianity, the story alone is truly compelling. It's definitely a movie worth seeing."
1,SOOOOOO Disappointed - Horrible Movie,The book was not bad - but the movie was terrible. Actually beyond the worst I think I have seen in a long time.
4,"Great Movie, But Did Not Really Follow the Book","When I first heard that a movie was going to be made that was going to be based on the Left Behind series I was very excited. The book series has become my favorite and I look forward to the release of every new book as it comes out, I just can't seem to get enough of them. While the movie was quite action packed it did leave out and change some of what was written in the original book. All in all the movie was still great and I would recommend it to anyone that has even the thought of seeing or buying it. I definately plan to go and see the movie when it comes out in theatres on February 2, 2000."
5,Exellent film with a great message...,"This film has it all, great cast, wonderful acting, great production values, and a message that will touch many lives. And a plain and simple enjoyable film to watch. This movie will inspire you to read the Bible! A great film to watch with the family."
2,The Book Is Better,The movie is very disappointing. It doesn't even come close to the book. I would not recommend this movie to any followers of the Left Behind series.
2,not so good,"this movie is okay but not so good for kids. when my kids saw this movie, they got real focussed on when people disappeared, how their clothes were left behind--no joke intended. so my kids got all wound up about the idea that people were naked in heaven and i can't seem to get the idea out of their heads. i told them that it is not true but they keep talking about how they will see everyone in heaven naked.michael fox is top notch in this movie though and its good to see a Christian film with a more hollywood type budget."
2,Major disappointment,"What a letdown. I was expecting much more. Loosely based upon the 1st 2 books of the 'Left Behind' series, the movie assumes that the viewer already knows certain things. And that's where the problem lies. If I was a not a Christian and saw this movie, I would be curious but that's about all. 'The Omega Code' was better. I think that a TV series on PAX would be more effective--cover all of the books released to-date and stay close to the story line! Read the books--much better."
1,as bad as it gets,"this is a white boy protestant-christian fundamentalist movie...the whole story is a joke....its recycled elements from Stephen Kings Langoliers...from Devils Advocate and from other movies. Then it goes on to show its right wing agenda by showing Israel as a victim, the UN as a demonic entity (even the John Birch society doesnt go that far), and people of other cultures as colaborators with the 'devil' (Arabs, East Indians etc.) The acting is some of the worse i have ever seen in my life and everything else is so low budget that i dont know wether to laugh out loud or just plain out cry. I've seen some bad movies in my life but this one takes the grand prize. I would rather watch a Rob Scnider movie..i think it would make more sense."
5,Wake Up America!,"Wake Up America! The alarm's are going off and the hour is late! That's what the ""Left Behind"" movie is telling us. I loved this film as it speaks truth. I pray that you will watch it and ""hear"" the message. The world as we know it IS about to change for all eternity and the ""Left Behind"" film will help you on your quest for Truth in a world gone mad. Yes, truth is still spoken in America, you just have to know where to find it! For the sake of you and your families, GO SEE LEFT BEHIND BEFORE ""YOU"" ARE LEFT BEHIND!"
2,So-So,"I watched this movie because several people told me that it was a GREAT movie. Not so. Anyone who did not read the book will not really know what is happening, nor will they know the issues the main characters grappled with in deciding to turn to God. This movie is not a bad movie, but it would have been much better if the people involved would have taken their time to develop the story and turn it into a television mini-series instead."
3,The message is there.,"First of all, as with any movie made from a book, of course it is impossible to catch all the emotion and internal struggles that each of the characters face. I was a little disappointed that it lacked a lot of content from the book, but the message was very well felt. I really enjoyed seeing the part when Nicholae had the meeting with the UN and brainwashed everyone. It really brought the reality of the coming Ant-Christ to life. The film is a powerful tool however, to reach those we may feel could be left behind. The message is there,the return of Christ and the reality that the scriptures will be fulfilled, are displayed. I suggest any Christian and believer to get the film. God bless.To those skeptics out there who may see the movie. It's a fictional scenario about an apocalyptic reality. I encourage you as well to see the movie."
3,Left Behind,"I bought and watched the movie-Left Behind- yesterday. I was very excited about watching it because I completely believe the message that it is trying to get across. However, I was a little disappointed after seeing the movie. I think that it needed to give more details about what was going on because if you are a non-believer and you are not familiar with the Bible, then you are not going to understand what is going on during this movie. Also, I feel that it should have shown more of what will(or what we think) will happen during that 7 year period so that people will really think about their own lives and want to make a change if they need to. The actors did a good job in this movie, but the movie overall what not as powerful as I had expected. Please keep up with the movies though because even if you only reach a few people, then that is better than reaching none."
3,"Average, too good for life movie stars trying to act pivotal","Skinny stewardess', an antichrist who's charcter does not fit the role, and a reporter that has never really seems to belong in the scheme of things mark this as a rather average jaunt. The books were awesome, if a little understated in some things regarding technology, but it gets a little old when all we see is size six actresses, and somewhat buff actors attempting to act out the rolls of what we have come to interpret as everyday, some successful, some not, characters who were excellently detailed in the books. I did not imagine Cameron Williams as being the type of person who is photogenic, but rather a little rugged. In some cases, this is the complete opposite, the people you would expect to be photogenic are, in fact, plain looking; as in the case of Nicolae Carpathia.But then, this is the modern age, and everyone on film has to look good."
4,Good for non-readers,"Although I wouldn't reccomend the book to those who have read and loved the Left Behind series, it is a very good movie to those who would rather watch then read. I know of several watchers, who since watching have decided to start reading the novels. Cloud Ten, being a fairly new company has done a very good job with a movie that has a very serious, and very scary plot. However, like I said, for those of us who have read and enjoyed the Left Behind books, it is lacking in the details and emotion found within those."
4,Can't wait for the next one.,Watched the Left Behind movie at least 6 times. It really makes the book of Revalation come alive. A must see for anyone interested in the end times and how God will work it all out. This is truth at its best folks.
5,LEFT BEHIND MOVIE,Truely I thank God for Christian movies like Left Behind- The Movie. I pray that more and more people would see it out of curiosity and for it's possibilities and come to know that there is a God out there that sits HIGH and looks LOW and He is coming back again for His people. We need to tell the world that Jesus is soon to return and you do not want to be LEFT BEHIND. This movie is the beginning of many more to follow in this series. It is a INCREDIBLE witnessing tool. Open up your heart and let Jesus in and let LEFT BEHIND- The Movie minister to your soul.
2,How can anybody take seriously...,a movie with Kirk Cameron?If god exists at least he has a sense of humor!
2,Defiantly not the Book!,"I know that sometime they have budget problems and so they have to keep costs down.And on an occasion I can live with this as I did on this movie.But the change in the movie was just to much.I think the meaning of the story and characters were lost.Changing a few details from the books is one thing,but too many can be a bad thing.If I had known I would have saved myself a few dollars in the long run.Cameron and the other main actors were good.And as a Christian,I will pray that the movie does well in theaters despite my opinion.I think its time Hollywood{Hellwood}get off their buts and spend the time and money and make good Christian movies.Despite my criticism,I would recomend this movie only as rental but the books a best buy."
1,Worst ever,"I thought Cameron was bad in ""Growing Pains"" but now he has achieved new lows. Terrible acting and even worse production values. Avoid this."
2,thrilling concept but execution stank to high heaven,"I was initially excited about this movie because it deals with the apocalypse. Since it was an independent film, I hoped it would be of higher quality than Hollywood dreck such as ""Armageddon"" and ""Independence Day."" Well I was sorely disappointed. The acting was mediocre at best and I kept looking at the clock wondering how much longer I'd have to endure the below-average dialogue and plot. Save your eyesight and watch something more exciting. I have **no idea** why this has such high ratings. I'm Catholic but this movie bored and irritated me."
2,Cruciflicks' Review,"""The only positive element I could find from this film was the actor portraying the Antichrist. And you know what's sad? When the only good thing you can find about a Christian movie is the Antichrist."" -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder""The story ""Left Behind"" is based on is a powerful one. It makes me think of the old song ""I Wish We'd All Been Ready"" by dc Talk. It's definitely a movie meant to send a clear message: get right with God before it's too late. And it does a decent job of conveying that to the audience. However, (I hate to sound like a broken record) the acting is a hindrance to the effectiveness it carries."" -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films, check out cruciflicks.net where ""We don't judge people, just the movies they make."""
2,Poor compared to the book,"After reading the fantastic (5 Star) novel Left Behind a friend lent me the video. I was very dissapointed as the movie is an abridged version of the book with some parts rewritten to speed up the action. The result was a rather boring movie with virtually no character development. Almost none of the underlying reasons for what happens is revealed in the movie. This was very important in my enjoyment of the book. I supposed if I hadn't read the book I could have enjoyed it as some low budget action flick, but over all I can't recommend it."
1,Leave This Movie Behind,"God has allowed us the greatest gift of all, the freedom of choice. I urge you to choose not to get this movie. After seeing this movie (as well as reading the novel), my friend and myself were struck by how loose the plot of the movie followed that of the book. If you need some examples of how loose it was...Chloe was at school when the dissapearances happened, correct? Also, did Buck and Rayford meet on the plane when rapture happened? How about the emotionally charged scene with Bruce and Rayford's acceptance of God, did that happen? Even though it may have (loosely) held the same meaning, I think that the people who praise this movie as a film must look at the character development AND the (quick) progression of the storyline. Those who say that this is a good film are deceiving themselves. If you need any further information, contact: peachfarmerj@hotmail.com"
5,Awesome Movie!,This is an awesome movie. It gives you an idea what the world is going to be like once the rapture occur. This movie was an eye opener for me. It keeps me focus on the Kingdom of God and to want to be one of the ones raptured when Jesus come back.
2,"Sorry, but it's true. 2 stars","I love the book series, but the movie was disappointing. Now my family thinks the books are boring and that I have a lousy sense of good reading. This was the only thing that I thought could get my husband interested in reading the books, but he slept through most of the movie. I am sorry to all the hard working people.I don't think you should make any movies of the other books . I have read #'S 1-6 and can't wait to get # 7 in soft. Please, if you read this, do not skip the books. THE KIDS books are not as good, but they have different characters and stories. PLEASE USE YOUR MONEY ON THE BOOKS. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT THEM DOWN."
1,Embarrassing movie for Christians,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was an embarrassing production. Let's compare it to ""The Passion of the Christ"" and it is like comparing a high school play to a Hollywood blockbuster production."
5,Left Behind a must see!,This movie is excellent. It could very well change your life if you really listen with and open mind and heart. It's message about the Truth of the end times as prophecied in the Bible is absolutely crucial to the times we live in. The imagery and the acting are very well done. It comes to the theater February 2nd 2001 -- Go see it! Also buy it! YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND!
3,Ok,but I would stop at Part I and don't look at Part II because I think Part II was poorly done. Most of these Christian films have so much potential if only they had the funding to make the movie much more believable and entertaining.
1,Don't bother.,Most movies are never on the same par as the book equivalent. This movie was even worse. A terrible disappointment after reading such an engrossing book.
4,An amazing book takes life on the big screen.,"I agree with one reviewer on this movie, Christian film-making has a *long* way to go to be competitive with the secular industry. However, this film surprised me very much! The acting was much better than expected. Gordon Currie is amazing as Nicolae Carpathia! Kirk Cameron does a surprisingly great job as well. Most of the cast did better than I expected. The story does move fast though (if you're a fan of the books) but you get the point. The plan of salvation isn't clearly spelled out but you can get the idea fairly well from the ""pastor's video"". All in all, this is a good film. I am a bit skeptical about how well this could do at the box office but only time will tell."
3,Left Behind and Tribulation Force,"The movie was not fantastic. I was expecting it to be better, however, it wasn't horrible either. I was disappointed in how it strayed from the books...which I absolutely LOVED! But, I understand that with only a couple of hours...in order for the story to make sense..some things had to be different. The acting wasn't great and the special effects weren't anything to write home about, but I will buy the 3rd movie when it comes out...because it is interesting to actually see some of the things that I've read."
2,Chelsea and Kirk are in it for the money,"I have read some of the articles about the movie where Kirk and Chelsea are interviewed. Both of them express their deep religious beliefs and how this movie was made for them. I can see Kirk as Buck Williams but I thought it was strange that Chelsea WANTED to be Hattie. Does Hattie reflect the type of person that Chelsea is? Why didn't Hattie want to be Rayford's wife, a hero of the first novel? She wanted to be Hattie because she has read all of the books and she knows that Hattie is still alive. Therefore the producers will have to cast her as Hattie in the upcoming movies. No offense to Chelsea, but what is the last movie or tv show you have seen her in.Lastly, what is up with the guy they have cast as Nicolae? He looks like he is about four feet tall and 120lbs. Not too intimidating!It's worth seeing if you've read the books. If you haven't read the books you will be lost!"
4,Big surprize!,"I read the book before I bought the video, and as is usually the case, the movie did not quite reach the level of enjoyment as the book, but it was darn close. The cast was well picked, and did a great job. I thought there might have been a little too much preaching than was needed, but it was, after all, meant to be delivering a strong message. Good family video if you, the parent, have the time to explain what is going on to the younger viewers. Buy this video, and watch it often."
2,detective barbie 2 review,I've played the game before and loved it but the one i purchased always freezes in the same spot so i wouldn't recommend buying a game off line because of this.
2,Barbie Bummer,"Hi, I bought my daughter Philipa this game and to put it in her words, ""Dad, this game you bought me was really no good. I did not have any fun at all. Most of my friends were kinda thrown off by the unrealistic and complicated two dimensional physical world representation, with corresponding navigational method. Total bummer Dad! Why couldn't you have given me a much more natural 3-D game. You know you really need to get with it dad."" I think that about sums up the game. So now I am off to find another game. A game with real 3-D."
1,Unhappy,"This item was reviewed with Ocean Suite as having ocean sounds. It has no ocean sounds, just some musical sounds that someone may think mimic the ocean. I don't, and I am unhappy with it. I am shipping it back for a refund."
1,"Buggy, many problems",We had tremendous trouble with this software. It didn't work about 25% of the time. It would actually freeze up the computer. First software for which I wanted a refund. Needs work!
5,great book to build understanding,"This is a great book. My 10 year old picked it out after a week when he was feeling that ""grown ups just don't understand"". He wanted us to read it so we could see how he was feeling, but then it helped him to better understand the adult perspective too."
5,"Remarkable Book: the Work, the People and the Experience","As Ouspensky reported Gurdjieff in ""In Search of the Miraculous"",""The teaching whose theory is here being set out is completely self-supporting and independent of other lines and it has been completely unknown up to the present time""To the body of work surrounding the system, has been added a contemporary look at the Fourth way from the position of someone who lived it. Remarkable honesty, an attention to detail, and a deep feeling for the value of the Work, animate this book. The significance of this book lies in the fact that Mr. Patterson belongs to the tradition, having worked extensively with Lord Pentland himself.I came to the Fourth Way through the writings of Colin Wilson (see my review of ""The Outsider"" at Amazon), and haven't come across any other book that has described as well what it means to ""live the work"".My heartfelt gratitude..."
1,Not Very Good!!,All I saw were trains I want to see the view from trains.The HD was not very good either.
3,Help! Preparing for the wedding,"Being on the other side of the country, it is difficult to help our daughter prepare for her wedding. Sending her this planner is one of the best things we can do to help her organize this big event, especially since we are doing this on a shoestring! She loves the guide."
2,Not at all like advertised,"My boyfriend gave me this digital picture frame as a gift, and we were both quite disappointed by the resolution. The picture quality is quite poor, and nothing like the great pictures they show on advertisements or the box. You can see each pixel on the screen, and you must be a specific distance away to truly enjoy the photographs. Perhaps we are just spoiled by the great quality we can see on our computer."
2,disappointing,"This program was recommended to me by a friend whose opinions I pretty much trust - this time he was wrong. Not funny. Canned laughter, the servant is named Manuel, the humor is dated. Sorry - thumbs down."
3,Wallowing in mediocrity...,"This was not one of the best Blaze books I've read, but it also was not one of the worst... I would have preferred if Amanda had more hang-ups (or a more extended storyline... tell us more about what happened with the guy at Harmons), instead of making all the conflict come from Zach. The sex scenes were hot, but too unrealistic to really be enjoyed. I don't understand how these books make the couple fall madly in love with each other, to the point of MARRIAGE, after only a week of knowing one another.Read this only if you have NOTHING better on your shelf... And get it from the library; don't waste money on it!"
5,Barbie Digital Makeover,"This is my favorite Barbie game I have! You can put your picture in the game and then give yourself new hairdoes and makeup! You can also make new makeup! The only bad things are it's really are to get your picture to look normal. Sometimes it gives you one eye on your cheek or two chins. And you don't have very many hairdoes to pick from. You can't do ponytails, braids, or straight hair with bangs. (And that's what my air looks like.) You also can't change your skin or eye color.I think it would be fun to put my cat's picture in it and put makeup on him!"
2,Ollie Hopnoodle and the Haven of Bliss,"I believe that this was the third installment in the Ralphie trilogy, and unfortunately the least well done. As a joint venture between Disney and Boston's Public TV station, WGBH, it's characters didn't seem fully developed and the acting seemed shallow in comparison to ""A Christmas Story."" It came across as a low-budget effort.I also had a little trouble with the title, which most of this 100 minute movie didn't actually deal with. Jean Shepard's cameo role as Ralphie's first boss was . . . different, with his character appearing visually stunning and a cross between an Hasidic diamond merchant and Gimli the Dwarf in ""Lord of the Rings."" No human being has ever had this amount of facial hair.By today's standards this certainly wasn't a bad movie, but it didn't have the attention to detail the first two did and the various story lines had the potential to be taken so much further."
2,Meh,"I'll keep this simple.The concept is interesting, but the story goes nowhere and much of the same lines keep popping up over and over again. This is not an attempt at theme, but rather cleverness beaten over the head until it ceases being clever and just lies there in a pool of its own smugness.Also, if our hero automatically thinks to death anyone who annoys him, even in the most mild way, why doesn't he kill all those annoying people that accompany him on his travels?Anyway, didn't like it, didn't finish it, won't bother with this writer again."
1,Utterly ridiculous waste of time,"Carl Streator, a journalist, and Helen Boyer, a realtor specializing in haunted properties, stumble upon a nursery rhyme book containing a deadly ""culling spell"" from Africa. Together, they travel across America, ripping the spell from library books, stealing passwords to computer files (hint: every password is ""password""), and manage to fornicate while levitating. Huh? Well, if dull, underwriten characters, ludicrous plot twists, and uninspired prose appeal to you, you'll love this novel."
3,More of the same from Chuck but is that bad?? (3.5 stars),"Lullaby is Palahnuik's fifth and by now we have come to expect culture commentary, eccentric characters, absurd surreal plotting and general debauchery associated with sex, drugs, and rock & roll. Palhnuik does this better than anyone but I have accepted the idea that reading all of his books in a row is not the preffered method. Taking some time in between books will make his disticnt writing style less repetitive.Also his books aren't for everyone as they are filled with dry humor and moral amibuguity. If the idea of random bodies dropping like flies in the middle of absurd situations doesn't sound entertaining...than Lullaby isn't for you. Other than that Lullaby is your typical C.P. fare but not as strong as some of his other books.Bottom Line: Great book but not the place to start if you haven't read any of Palhnuik's other books. Try Survivor or Invisible Monsters first."
4,"Palahniuk recovers after ""Choke""ing","Most readers of Lullaby, like myself, have read most if not all other novels by Chuck Palahniuk. And most were disappointed with the author's previous novel, Choke. Thankfully he rebounds significantly with Lullaby.In Lullaby we have a world where black magic exists. Most significantly, a ""culling poem"" contained in a children's book kills the recipient (listener) of the poem. In comes a very eclectic mix of misfits who both abuse this culling poem and try to limit its distribution. Granted, the premise of the book is a bit ... weird. But story moves at a good pace, and the ending is particularly ... weird (in a good way).However compared to Palahniuk's early works (Fight Club, Invisible Monsters) Lullaby is still a bit of a disappointment. Missing are Palahniuk's scathing wit and his brilliant humour. However compared to Choke it is much better written, and its plot better defined.Bottom line: Palahniuk has woken up! Recommended."
3,I enjoyed it,"I enjoyed the book - it was a quick, easy read. But it's not something that stood out as memorable. I like Chuck's writing and will continute to read him in the future, but I felt like he could have done better on this one."
3,"Original, Anarchist, Dadaist but Overated","This book is much like the author's earlier Fight Club in that the dialogue is pretty ""hip"" and that it is very nihilist and anarchist in nature. It follows the story of a man who discovers a ""culling song"" that has the ability to put people to death and the author's inability to restrain himself in its use. Not that he is alone in that regard, the protagonist discovers quite a few people who not only do not restrain themselves but use the song for profit and an ideological agenda.Despite the books originality, it has a number of weaknesses. One is the writing style. It consists almost entirely of short sentences. A second problem is that there are quite a few gaps in the story line. For example, it is not clear how the author discovers the culling song to begin with, among other things.All and all a three star book."
4,What Can I Say - It's Chuck!,"I tore through this book. Of course, true to fashion, Chuck delivered prose in an unusal and eccentric style and gave me quite a few things to think about. I would highly recommend."
4,Haunted,A nice departure from his first three books.Recommend this book for all us warped people.I will never sing another lullaby without first doing research.
4,"Better than Invisible Monsters, not as good as Fight Club","This is a good, solid Palahniuk novel. Oddly enough, this foray into the realm of magic is more believable than the incredible string of coincidences in another novel by the same author, Invisible Monsters. Basically, it answers the question, ""What would you do if you had the power of a god?"" The answer, as anyone who has read Palahniuk will know, is not pretty. It doesn't quite measure up to the mind-blowing Fight Club, but then not much does."
4,An interesting vision,"Reading Lullaby, I kept thinking of Thomas Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49. They share not only aloof prose, post-modern juxtaposition, and comically baroque detail, but also the same sense of order just below the surface of ordinary life. In Lullaby, that order is embodied in ""a culling song,"" a rhyme that--when read from a children's book, recited, or even thought--kills the listener. Behind that central premise is another--if something like this can exist, where does it come from and what sort of world are we really living in? ""Paranoia"" is the simple term for that feeling, but it's bigger than that. Once you see a new truth--and the prose reinforces that everything is connected--how can you discount anything as insignificant?"
4,I loved this book!,"This was my first novel by this author, and I loved it. I admit at first it was a little slow, but it got alot better fast. The characters are original, the plot is sprawling and humorous, and even makes you think. This is one of those books that you dont fully understand whats going on until the very last page. This book is part thriller, dramatic story, and comedy. This is why Chuck Palahniuk is in a class by himself!"
2,Fast Food,"The good news is that even slow readers can read this one in a day. The bad news is that's because this book is repetitive and largely lacking in substance. The characters are okay, and there are some interesting ecological details, as well as some extradark humor. Still, this is a 10-page short story stretched over 250 pages."
1,READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR HAIR,"While straightening, your hair will become caught in between the purple ceramic piece and the steel. This is very painful and will also pull out your hair."
3,It's Alright...,"I saw this for a great sale price and so I was really excited to have a straightener that was a little better quality. It does seem to straighten my hair a little better than my Target $20 one but the reviews are right, if you get your hair close to the edges it gets caught in there. I have fine easy hair and I can avoid getting it pulled by straightening small pieces at a time but it's still a bummer. I also didn't realize that for short hair I like the skinnier model better."
2,It was great... when it worked,"I bought this May of 07'. I had a difficult time finding flat Iron that I liked and after doing my research I purchased this because Hot Tools had a decent reputation and a lot of my friends owned it and loved it. It worked fabulously until about August when it decided it didn't want to turn on anymore. At first I thought maybe it was my outlet so I tried other outlets and got nothing, needless to say I was bummed. I don't know if this is a common problem or not but I don't think I want to chance buying another one"
2,Go with Frommers,"I am a planner freak, so I used this book and Frommers. I ended up relying on the Frommers as it was more detailed, more accurate with pricing, and included alot of stuff LP didn't.LP is outdated, and it only had general information about Belize....not as specific as Frommers."
2,Not up to Lonely Planet's typically high standards,"I typically only consider buying the Lonely Planet guidebook when traveling, but was disappointed with the Belize guidebook after recently returning from an 8 day trip. The book was well-organized and included useful maps and such as is typical of Lonely Planet guidebooks, but several of the descriptions of attractions I visited seemed inaccurate with respect to the type of service (tour company) and level of physical exertion required (natural/historical attraction) I experienced. Upon re-reading the guidebook after leaving Belize, I was left with the impression that some descriptions may originate from second-hand conversations with other travelers or interviews with tour operators rather than first-hand experience and would encourage potential travelers to shop around prior to purchasing this guidebook."
4,good sophomore album,"I became a Kellie Coffey fan after buying her first cd, ""When You Lie Next To Me"". I found out recently that she had released a sophomore album and decided to buy it. It continues the country-pop style of her first cd. I'm eagerly looking forward to her next release. My favorite songs on the album are the ballads: Walk On, Strong Enough To Cry, I Would Die For That, Thought I Knew You Well, Everywhere, I Had A Dream, Proud Of Me, There You Go Again.Tag: country music"
4,"DO UPSCALE HAIR SALONS OFFER LAP DANCES, TOO?",... it's hard to believe that this slammin' house mix is designed for play in hair salons - close your eyes for a moment and you'd think it's Saturday night at your favourite strip joint. Recommended.
2,Tiny,I'm sure these would be beautiful if you could actually see them. They're seriously the size of my nose ring. Which may be good for some... But not me :)
5,I love em!,"I absolutely love these earrings! Very cute, trendy and simple. They're the perfect size and are of great quality."
3,It's okay but you could do better,"This book is just an ""okay"" introductory text on capoeira. A major draw back is the centeral focus on capoeira regional, a better text would be ""Ring of Liberation"" because it more comprehensivly covers capoeira."
3,Mean to His Horses,"A very interesting book. I find it strange how one can reinvent, not just himself, but a whole family. Means is a name that has roots in Scotland and migrated to Ireland. My Great Geat Grandfather Austin Means was not Indian. Russell lived with my Grandfather and Father for a short period of time as is mentioned in his book (although the names were not accurate).I have found this book to be revisionist in the history of his family and his involvement in AIM. I respect his spiritual vision but his memory (or his honesty) is very flawed. If you read this book, you need to understand that he speaks to his own idea of the events as they happened. Not neccissarily for his people or for his family."
4,Pretty much as advertized!,"Arrived promptly and all parts were there. Installation was somewhat difficult and I had to borrow a center punch to start the drill holes. It looks good, but it does stretch so I have to tighten occasionaly."
2,Endless Annoying Unconvincing,Motives are unconvincing. Characters shallow except for the main characters who are unbelievable as well as annoying. Overuse of the theme of water is suffocating and dreary.
5,Grandson loves it.,"Our 4 year old grandson sleeps with this. Perfect Christmas gift for him. He's a real ""Power Ranger"" kind of guy."
1,Not as depicted or worth the money,"I have to agree with NA NA that this is a bad buy for what it is. I have seen and handled swords with stainless hilts, and concluded that the price and the picture depicted such a sword. I was grossly disappointed when it arrived and will try to return it. It's really the same sword being sold by another vendor for $10 and change - stainless blade with a plastic hilt."
3,not of this earth meets vampires,"I found this on the Vamps and Witches 4 movie set for about $5, so at $1.25 per movie I wasn't disappointed. The story line was a bit odd as to the relationship with the snake creature that sucked the life out of the victims with a lightning beam of some sort... after the female vampire had their way with them first, both sexually and then blood draining. The women were mostly good looking and the sex average for a softcore movie, the gore was on the light side. Was true to form for the Witchcraft series with a simple plot and lots of flesh, worth a watch."
3,Entertaining,"Anyone interested in the philosophy of language will find Derrida's deconstructionist take on J.L. Austin's ""How to Do Things With Words"" quite interesting, and, at times, enlightening. But the real fun in this book is when Derrida begins to attack John Searle's response to Derrida's take on Austin. He takes off his gloves and really goes after him and if anything, you'll be left questioning your assumptions about the maturity levels of renowned academics."
4,excels at both arcade style and realistic style baseball,"This game that has something for everyone. On the fun side, it has plenty of extreme moves run-of-the-mill baseball games lack, like larger than life catches, baserunning, and pitching. But, you can also play in realistic mode, where it plays more like a usual baseball game, but it has an extensive baseball simulation that tops even the straight sim type baseball games, with things like, ticker scores scrolling onscreenn while you are online of the current mlb games going on and the full range of team managing including minor league signs, team stealing percentages, etc. finally you dont have to buy 2 baseball games anymore, slugfest has the best fun baseball game as well as the best realistic one out this year, all in one game."
5,MLB Slugfest Loaded for PlayStation 2,"Step up to the plate for some fast and furious play. MLB Slugfest Loaded features beanballs, hard tags, take-out slides at second and charging the mound. Licensed by Major League Baseball, this action-packed game also lets you take your swings with your favorite teams, players and stadiums. New online functionality expands the multiplayer experience for head-to-head play, leader boards, tournaments and live chat. You can even take part in a fantasy draft, free agent signings, trades, cutting players and roster moves."
3,Gene Florence/glassware 40's 50's & 60's,"The information in the book is interesting but not specific enough. Pages of pictures but do not name the pieces and sometimes it is difficult to know which piece is which. Also, can't really see the patterns very well; maybe so he can sell the book that just has patterns."
3,Kind of works on the odor but DOES NOT STOP SWEATING...,This spray is so-so ....it controls the strength of the odor but does not eliminate it completely and IT DOES NOT KEEP YOUR FEET DRY AT ALL. Changing your socks twice/three times (depending on your odor) would work better than this spray but ofcourse thats really inconvinient..so this spray will do for most of your day but after a full day your feet will be sweaty and smelly...
5,Delicious!,"I tried ""Inis"" without ever having smelled it and, was so pleasantly surprised. Everyone asks what I am wearing. It is clean and lingering."
3,bath gel,"Very light scent,foams up well.Good for morning showers scent is not overwhelming in the early AM. I use it am"
5,This was a Great Deal on a Tascam Portastudio!,"Used, but like New, I was lucky to get one of these gems at this price! Delivered quickly and packed for the journey, I have been making tracks with it since it arrived! Thanks, Amazon, the Online Store with MORE!"
5,"Cute, Funny - Loved it!",This book was full of humor and interesting secondary characters - one of Sizemore's lighter works but it was fun reading. I would like to see sequels and learn more about Kit's family of spies.
2,Not a helpful book.,"This book may be useful in introducing people to the many benefits of the Alexander Technique, but it contains a great many inaccuracies and oversimplifications. It is possible to learn a good deal on one's own - although the help of a qualified teacher can save you a lot of time. If you don't have access to an Alexander Teacher and want to try learning the Technique on your own, get ""How to Learn the Alexander Technique"" by Barbara Conable. If you want to understand the basics of the Technique, get ""Fitness Without Stress"" by Robert Rickover or ""Body Learning"" by Michael Gelb."
2,Old fashioned and out of touch,"I just can't see how anyone could mistake this for an 'important' book. While incredibly courageous women like Jane Marcus and Mary Daly have demonstrated the patriarchal agenda of hatred which threatens the freedom of all Women, white male authors such as this one crazily accuse women of material greed! So while women don't earn as much money as males, it is a sign of big bad feminism that women wish to be paid for their efforts??? This is a worthless book by a priviledged white male writer, an enemy of women and thus an enemy of minorities."
4,"European history, medieval culture....great nordic metal.","Probably the greatest chance to make the great adventure in the Past Times. That's clear for me that this album has viking roots. Anyway it is as nordic as possible. As the title says: this is a story about Past Heroes, men of great honour. Fast but epic - very interesting mixture. Worth listening - for ""viking metal"" fans a must."
5,Blew up my boat!,"I bought this pump for my Sevylor HF350 inflatable boat. It blew it up in about 20 minutes of actual run time. The directions read to take a 20 minute break after 10 minutes of continuous use.I was surprised by how it keeps on pumping even with a lot of back pressure and resistance from the inflatable.Afterwards, I blew up a Coleman Colossus raft in about 5 minutes, and an air mattress in about 2 min!!So far, I think it's a great value."
5,Works GREAT,"I haven't had it long, but I just came back from a 5-day trip where I used this unit multiple times. It pumped my twin air matress up in under 60 seconds. One of the guys on our trip was impressed with it so much that plans to buy one from Amazon as well.The charge was more than sufficient for my 5-day trip. I can't currently speak to how well it retains a charge over time. It was well worth the money spent."
3,Coleman air pump,"Generally satisfied. The deflating side works very well; much better than trying to squeeze the air out. Inflation is somewhat slower than I had hoped and the pointed attachment does not open some of the flapper valves, requiring squeezing them. Portability without extension cords is a big plus."
3,"Works well, but is loud","Overall I am happy with this air pump so far. It's light, rechargable, gets the job done quick. It is SO LOUD though, I will always make sure to air things up before anyone in the house or campground is asleep.Despite the noise I would recommend this pump, especially if you own a coleman air mattress since it has the right attachment to blow them up and deflate them very quickly and easily."
4,Love it!!!,"Bought this one for my coleman 18"" air mattress. Tried today and my mattress was ready in 1 min. It is bit loud though. I will suggest this product to any one. It is rechargable and like the deflate feature."
1,works great until battery dies (about 20 uses for me),It worked great while it worked- I got about 20 uses out of it before the battery just died. To me 20 uses (not 20 uses on a charge but 20 uses before the battery was trash) is just not enough. One star- stay away.
5,Wow,"After charging the pump on Thursday, I was able to blow up 2 medium-sized rafts and my 2-person kayak on Friday. Then without recharging it, I used it Sunday to inflate my kayak. It works quickly, and is not too loud (not exactly quiet though.)"
4,Coleman Rechargeable quick pump,I think this is going to work out just fine to inflate things at the beach. This way I don't need to have them filled up in my car.
3,"NOT Universal, and Weak","This unit comes with two adapters, neither of which properly fit inflatable vinyl products such as pool mattresses. The smaller of the two adapters fits most of the way into the inflation port, but has to be pushed hard to fit far enough into the port to not leak out the sides. It is also not very powerful; when filling units through that small port, air leaks back out of the pump's air intake port. The unit is noisy, but not excessively so. The unit requires 10 hours of charging (via the included DC ""wall wart"" adapter) before use. It uses sealed lead-acid batteries, and the documentation says it will hold a charge for several months. It IS convenient, however, not needing to find a power outlet when filling inflatable products, such as at poolside."
5,5 stars,"krosoczka, being both illustrator and author, has created an amazing book. sure to make your child comfortable with their own creativity and individuality. high 5."
5,My kids LOVE this book!!,I teach kindergarten and just bought this book. My class loved the book so much I have already read it to them about 5 times. They ask for it everyday!
1,"Nice design and good quality leather top, but CHEAP SOLE!","What you have read about Kenneth Cole Unlisted shoe soles are true. Mine lasted less than 3 months and the sole on my right shoe literally split open. I do not wear the same shoe every day. I guess I wore the Unlisted pair about twice a week, with the most heavy walking from the parking lot to the office. These shoes may look nice, but the rubber sole is really really poor quality. AVOID THE SHOES!"
4,Price is right,"These shoes are basically exactly what you'd expect. They look nice. They are relatively uncomfortable after a long period of time wearing them. Also, you get creases on the top of the shoes that look a little worse than normal wear after a dozen or so times wearing them.I give them 4 stars because they're a very sharp looking shoe for the price. Figure you're renting them for like a $1 per time worn, and you're getting a solid deal."
3,Commercial Julie,"This is a low-budget attempt to make a hit. And it doesn't work. The singer, in her fifties, is in top form. But she seems in the recording to be in another building. Bob Florence, her long-time accompanist and one of the giants of jazz, produced and directed the album. He did not pull it off. On track 3, Julie is trying to sound like Liza Minelli. In track four, the tempo is taken very slowly and the singer seems to whispering part of the song. Florence mars many tracks with then-hip electronic instrumentation. Still, there are some lovely moments on the album, especially Florence's ""Soundsketch"" and ""What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life."" In short: Two huge talents and one flawed recording."
3,Only worth it if you can go online,Overall this is not a bad game but if your not playing online do not buy area 51. The single player is really short and the last part of the game sucks. the online does kick ass
1,This book is totally missing the point!,"I think this book is totally missing the point. I think that the author has no clue about what he is talking about. Information is plentiful, but that is all, there is no insight as to how the information fit together. I could go on... but I think I have made my point"
3,Cute first purse,"I was looking for a soft purse for my 16 month old daughter. I saw this and the price was right. The purse is cute and definitely holds all the accessories. My daughter favors the cell phone over anything in the set. The set is very soft especially the compact. I wish the compact opened or folded and then closed with velcro because I think my daughter would play with it more. Also, our phone and turtle key fob don't work quite as well as I would like. My daughter has a hard time pressing the phone hard enough in the right spot to make it ring and our turtle key fob rarely squeeks. Overall I'm satisifed with it, but I don't think I would purchase it again."
5,Sprit Walker By Miichelle Paver,"Michelle Paver writes a heartstopping seqel to Wolf Brother.Spirit Waker is about 2 people in the Raven Clan getting sick and eventually dieing.So Torak laeves to find a cure.Along the way he makes friends with a boar,but it attacks him and he kills it.However he discovers someone made the boar attack him.He thinks someone is following him.He goes to the sea to find the cure but just gets in trouble for mixing the forest with the sea.The Seal Clan takes him and trys to kill him but he talks them out of it.They have already had the sickness and know the cure.Will they help him?"
4,Mesmerizing for Children & Parents alike.,My 1st grader requested Chronicles of Ancient Darkness #1 from a school book order form. I ordered it before realizing it was actually a reading level geared towards 5th graders. The best mistake I ever made! We then visited our friend www.Amazon.com & purchased Chronicles of Ancient Darkness #2: Spirit Walker. It was hypnotizing in it's visualization. It makes my son and I feel as though we are Torak & Renn with Wolf 6000 years ago! We read these books through one or two chapters a night. We're reading the 'extras' in the back of the book that include information about survival of the people & creatures from prehistory as well as an exerpt from Book #3: Soul-Eater!
2,Too dated for me!,"I wish I'd paid more attention to the publication date on this book. I also think the book should be subtitled: ""A HISTORY of Scrapbooking and Memory Makers."" There were few entries included that were from 2003, and many were from the late 1990's. Scrapbooking has changed so much in the last 8-10 years, and while this book serves as a great reminder of ""look how far we've come!"" it wasn't what I was looking for. Too many of the layouts featured are very dated. There were a few that I enjoyed, but those I probably already have seen from my years of getting the magazine!"
4,Good beginners book for scrapping! Many good ideas and techniques,I bought this book because I was getting started in scrapbooking. I have referred to it many times.
4,One flaw,"Great show with intriguing characters. Creative mysteries, not your run of the mill stuff. My only issue is, it does not contain an option for subtitles. I am not deaf or hard of hearing, but I am a mother of a young child. I like to watch after she goes to bed, keeping the volume very low to not wake her up (bedroom is right next to the tv room). Unfortunately, the volume had to be fully up to hear and follow the stories because there are not any subtitles."
3,Teeny tiny book...,"I didn't even realize how small this book was going to be until I received it.I was expecting something meaty (err, hearty!) out of this book. But it's so tiny, and seems rather cursory in scope. Not very impressed. But I only spent a couple dollars for it in the Marketplace, so no big loss.I'll stick withThe Vegetarian Table: Thailand, thanks... Much heartier, prettier and heftier."
1,Awful!,Menuhin and Kempf are very fine musicians and one wonders what happened here; perhaps two great musicians playing against each other. This is arguably one of the worst sets of the Beethoven violin sonatas available. I unfortunately own this set on LP and Deutsche Grammophon couldn't give me this set on CD.
3,What got Burned?,"Rhythmic and ambient Indy-rock with fluctuating drum fills and angry screaming. The guitar licks are very translucent, and whip across your stereo speakers like the wiper blades on your car. Indy rock & roll with a bit more of a cosmic approach, they prefer to lay down soundscapes with live drum lines during their choruses. This record attempts to take a trip back to the halcyon days of Psychedelia with a stripped-down three-chord ambience. Scatter the Ashes is: Daryl Gahan, Dillon Thunder, Bob Spaceage & Matt McChord.

1,Useless,Bought one of these and it will not detect a wireless network 5 feet away even when a laptop shows 5 bars. Don't waste your money on this one. There are bound to be better detectors out there.
1,I'll try to be nice,"This is probably the most useless piece of equipment I've ever purchased. (You should hear me when I'm not trying to be nice)Couple of examples. One of my neighbors has a wireless network running that I can connect to, with my laptop, from 'good' to 'very low'. Usually low. The Kensington WiFi Finder doesn't find it. There's a coffee shop I go to that I connect to from 'Excellent' to 'Very Good'. It can't even find that one when I'm sitting in the coffee shop.The only time it was able to locate a wireless network was when I was walking across a college campus. Duh! And the signal registered as 'very low'.I don't know what you'd use this for, but finding wireless networks isn't one of them.P.S. Amazon should allow 0 star ratings"
2,Could be better,"There's no in between with this thing, I either get nothing(and my laptop tells me different), or all 5, though this is rare. I don't expect anything different, but it will pick up secured networks just as well as unsecured.What's with the little flashlight? It's about as useful as a wet sock and hard to work.This is the first Wifi finder I've had, but there's got to be better products out there."
1,Tater Mitts Product Review - Cooking With Jack Show,Length:: 1:25 MinsJack Scalfani reviews the Tater Mitts to see if they really work.
1,The worst product ever,"This has to be the worst ""as seen on TV"" product ever. I started without reading the instructions and got no where on the potatoes. So then I read the instructions that said to boil product before using the gloves. So I lightly boiled my potatoes. The Tater Mitts then proceeded to rip the potatoes apart, leaving blue plastic flecks all in the potatoes. Which I then had to peel by hand anyways, to make sure I was not feeding my family pieces of the ""tater Mitts""."
2,Cameron's UGLY!,"I don't have bratz babyz Cameron, but he's soooooo ugly! Who would wanna buy this? I'm a total bratz fan, but this baby is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to ugly!"
4,Damn good,I bought this book about 6yrs ago and now I'm on my third copy. My girlfriend use to have dinner parties with poetry readings and i would never participate. I finally decided I would use the book to read from. I picked out a poem called (Baby). For the next 10 min I could have gotten anything I wanted from any woman in the room. The poem was just that Damn GOOD.
3,"Beware, for small dogs only!","I too found this backpack Dog Carrier to be too small. My 13 pound dog was way too big for this backpack. So I had to return it.It advertises for Dogs up to 16 pounds but I think that is inaccurate. This backpack is probably more for dogs up to 10 pounds max!Other than it being too small for my dog, it did seem to be made well, with strong quality material.I would recommend this backpack but for the smaller dogs only.FYI: I did find one that fit my dog perfectly, called: Dog Gone Device.Happy Shopping!"
5,Excellent introduction to Amazon web services,I am relative novice when it comes to using web services but I have some experience with PHP. I found the examples in this book very useful for illustrating how to get up and running quickly while giving a good foundation for more experimentation. The Author does not give away all of the answers to building a complete Amazon app which I found to be be nice because it made me think of other more imaginative ways to use them.
2,Too Much and Too Little,".I am studying epidemilogical methods. I used this book one year ago for an introductory course. I did not enjoy the book, and my group (8) wanted their money back. I stopped reading the assignments out of the book half way through the course. The alternative readings were longer, had more depth, and were more fun.This book is a worldwind tour of health research methods. That's the problem. They try to cram it all in, in one book. The writting is therefore quick and dry : pI want to say something nice: You could use this book as a mini-mini-mini encyclopedia. If you were reading an article and found a study design that you are not familiar with, you could consult this book for the 30 second overview of a method : )If a professor ever asks you to buy this book, remember: you will likely never use this book again after your course. Borrow or buy a second hand copy. Even better, go to the library and read it there. Or how about skipping these readings alltogether? ; )"
1,One Star for this Hunk of Junk,"THIS MOUSSE IS TOTALLY TERRIBLE!!! I wouldn't use it if it were the LAST MOUSSE ON EARTH!!!! It didn't give my curls volume, it didn't do anything to stop frizz, it didn't hold and it did NOT enhance my curls. The worst thing about this mousse was that it didn't help my curly hair at all. It actually seemed to give me less curl."
1,this one's no good!,"I never like to write an entirely bad review on anything, so I'll start with a positive: this mousse was user-friendly because the dispenser was real easy to use.Other than that point, I can't think of anything good about this mousse.The hold level on this mousse was not as high as Loreal would like you to believe. I thought it had a minimum of hold whether I used it with or without hairspray. This mousse didn't inhibit frizz as well as the bottle insinuated either. AS for volumizing or adding body, this mousse fell short again."

2,Very sad,I LOVED the first two DVDs of the Key series. It made Key one of my favorite animes ever. But this third DVD made me even forget why I liked Key in the first place. I've never fallen asleep while watching a movie before. Not until watching this DVD anyway. It is SO boring! All they do is talk talk talk and talk some more. I don't see how anybody could hang on to every word and understand what is going on. I skipped right to the end of this DVD because I couldn't take it anymore. I saw how Key became human. I had no clue as to what happened but I needed to see the story come to an end anyway. If you're into animes with all talk and no action get this third DVD of Key. But if you're into great storytelling watch the first two Key DVDs and forget this one.
4,Great but incomplete,"I loved it, but it left too many questions unanswered. Unfortunately, I don't think the series was ever completed. With the release of so much anime today, I hope that they will complete this one."
2,I must be missing something,"Okay, I have the distinct feeling that I was supposed to read something before I saw this anime because there seems to be so much more then I saw going on. The plot seems to be somewhat serious until the characters break out in weird laughter or gags out of nowhere, kind of like in tenchi, but unlike tenchi there really isn't anything funny about it. Also, for an hour of anime, I was definently left with the feeling that there was so much left, maybe because none of the characters reached their stated goals and yada yada. I'd suggest Gestalt be watched once future volumes are released... but I've yet to find out if there is anything else to it. So... if you're really dying to see a different anime and you want something that's going to leave you wondering and confused... go for it! But otherwise, save your money."
2,Confusing,"This two episdoe OVA is about a pretty, pink haired girl named Ohri who's hiding a secret, and becomes the loyal slave of a young, priest named Oliver. The two of them set off to the island of G, but naturally run into trouble on their way there. One of their problems is Suzu the dark elf who has been sent by Oliver's church to go and get him. There's also tyranny in one of the places that they go to and must confront.The OVA has some very beautiful character designs. The story however, seems to be missing a lot of important information, is very rushed, and totally confusing."
2,Rent first before you purchase,"I am confused as to whether this video is a movie or a series. It ended as though a continuation is supposed to pop up in the local anime store sometime soon. But, unfortunately, there is none and I am left feeling dissatisfied. What happens eventually to the priest and the girl whom he saved from slavery? I guess I'd never know. The story is serious in some parts and then goes into fits super-deformed characters and exaggerated expressions which did not correspond well with the storyline (unlike Sailor Moon or Magic Knight Rayearth). I also didn't care for the characters - I found myself rooting for a tree or rock instead. The artistry is plain and looked like pastel paint. The dubbed voices was hard to listen to and the story wasn't satisfying. So, why not 1 star? Well, it had an excellent trailer clip on Rurouni Kenshin. Gotta love that trailer clip."
3,Star Trek: Starfleet Command II: Orion Pirates Review,"Overall, this game was a meduim on the scale. One big plus is that it doesn't require the original Star Trek: Startfleet Command II to run. But, the graphics were poor, and the lack of a substantial storyline had a major inpact. Also, there were many variations on ship classes. It gets confusing, remembering which ship you bought when.If I had a choice, I would use my money on the next game up, Star Trek: Starfleet Command III. It removes most of the flaws mentioned above, and it has a very good replay value. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to email me at cloudmouse@gmail.com. Thank you!Ryan :-p"
1,Won't even use them,"I will admit that I am a linen snob. I purchased this set after reading the great review for the sheets. There is NO WAY these can be 300TC. They have pilled. Are not smooth. And, if you have a pet, they seem to suck up all the pet hair in the house, and will not let go.AWFUL. Do not buy."
4,"Very good book, I enjoyed it very much.","As shadowrun books go this was one of the best I've read since the first trilogy. Although a full novel would have been better then an anthology, the stories were very intresting."
1,Not funny,I didn't like this book at all. I got to page 32 and laughed only twice. I guess I don't get his humor.
3,Early Version of 'The Crossing' Session,"This album is interesting for Big Country Fans because it shows how 'The Crossing' came together. This CD includes all the tracks from the first Big Country Album in early stage versions including a couple of songs which later on appeared on b-sides and also some previously unreleased tracks. The Sound quality is pretty good for 'demo versions' and the highlights to me are the versions of 'Harvest Home', the more 'heavy' version of 'Porrohman' and a great toake of 'Fields of Fire'. However, if you are not a Big Country collector, buy any of their original studio albums first or the fantastic live double CD 'Come out Screaming'. The tracks on this CD are :Heart and Soul (Version 1)In a Big CountryInwardsChanceA thousand StarsThe StormHarvest HomeLost PatrolClose ActionFields of FirePorrohmanAngle ParkThe CrossingBig CityRing out BellsEchoesWakeHeart and Soul (Version 2)The CD also includes a CD ROM featuring video clips and a photo gallery."
1,Good -for computer music history...,"After having read all the excellent reviews of this book, I had great expectations. But I was in for a surprise.The Computer Music Tutorial was written in the early 80's, with some of the pictures (and examples) from the 60's and 70's. I was hoping to get a book, which would teach me about todays synthesizers, about various (practical) methods to make music with computers.Instead, I got a book, which is highly theoretical, and which is very very old (can you imagine a computer book, which is at least 20 years old???)So: if you are interested in the historic aspects of computer music (and do not need anything relevant to today): get the book.I have returned the one I have bought...Good luck.Miklos"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!,If your looking for a better understand of the Ninja and the ways the Ninja used tricks of the mind in combat then DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK... On the other hand if looking for a book you could use to kill bugs with then by all means buy The Mystic Arts of the Ninja by Stephen Hayes.If you read the back cover you think this book was going to help you understand the history of the more mystical side of Ninjutsu... Nope. Mr. Hayes devotes more of the book to unclear photos of himself then any really shot at helping the reader in understand the combat arts of the ninja and how they came to be. so not worth $5 let alone 10 or 15.
4,Good and authentic,"I have read this book and it is quite good and very informative. I usually don't write reviews on books but I read the review below mine (David B. from Chiba, Japan , July 25, 1999) and I felt the need to say that this book is real. I have read a few of Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi's books and he mentions that Hayes was his first foreign student, which means David B. doesn't know what he's talking about. I'd recommend any of Hayes's books and also Masaaki Hatsumi."
5,Thermo Tec Mat,"This mat was actually larger than I expected from the description, so that was a bonus. It's easy to cut and works well in a number of under-hood applications."
5,Good Product,"It was exactly as I expected. Plenty long so that you can do a double layer facing toward the header. Installed on my 68 Camaro because my starter was not working due to heat, now it works just fine. :)"
3,Wine Rack,"Very had to assemble and the raw wood is very rough. If I had wanted it painted or stained, would have to spend many hours sanding and smoothing the wood. It was a good thing that I was placing the rack in a closet and did not need to finish it."
4,Does what it should,"It holds wine. Pretty simple. Easy to put together IF you have an electric screwdriver or a drill.Doesn't hold odd shaped bottles, just cab 750s. Stout pinot bottles are a tough fit.Cheap and good for the basement. It's not a fancy pants display, so load it up next to the Christmas decoration storage."
4,the Chemical Brothers and Art of Noise have a chill-baby,"if the chemical brothers and the art of noise were to make love, well this would be their chill baby.what can you tell from 30 seconds; usually not much but fire up, er down, moon sequence, floating world, and dark angel, to get an idea of some cool music.half of these songs are worth keeping. very nice! i've only got them @ 192kbps but if i ever get an audio system better than the ipod then i would purchase this CD without hesitation."
4,Great compilation from Elektrolux label,The ultimate chill out experience!Is a fantastic trip to electronica style featuring european artists! Try more cd's from this label! I have almost 50 cd's from this label! and its one of the greatest sounds ever!
2,Great for veg - NOT for rice!,"We had a stainless steel one which was fantastic but needed replacing and bought this one. Sadly, we wished we hadn't.The holes are too big and let the rice through both before and after it has been cooked.The idea is a great concept and it cooks the rice beautifully with minimum hassle. This would be great for veg. but don't buy it for rice unless you don't mind wasting a fair amount."
4,"I LOVED the smell of this product, and ...","I LOVED the smell of this product, and my daughter really enjoyed NOT having her mother pull her hair out when it came time to brush after washing!! I would recommend this product to anyone!"
3,I was surprised with this shampoo. Other shampoo ...,"I was surprised with this shampoo. Other shampoo and conditioner combinations usually proved unsatisfactory for me. However, this one did its job and left my hair feeling as if it had been shampooed and conditioned separately. I would recommend this to friends and family. And I'll be using it in my bathroom!"
5,Great DVD,This DVD is really good. It starts out with Dee and Ryo going on vacation. Away from all the crazy police life. They encounter a dead girl in the river that they are sailing in. There they meet the hotel owner. He seeks revenge for the murder of his daughter from japanese men. All the time this is happening Dee is trying to subdue Ryo into sleeping with him or at least getting Ryo to tell his feelings towards him.
3,It was pretty good but again a anime that leaves you Hanging,What is up with most anime that leaves you hanging. It was pretty good but I wish it was a series. But I think it was but they didn't want to publish anymore. It was funny and romanic in a weird way. But it leaves you hanging and wondering what happen next or what happen before. I don't like anime that gives just alittle informnation. It was ok. But it could of been better.
4,Almost there,"I liked this OVA for sure, but I was dissappointed that this was the only episode that they did, and they didn't even start at the begining of the series. It is funny though! I like the manga better because it has moe RyoxDee situations and more little facts. I watched it in Japanese before this, and it's kind of like Gravitation for me. The english voices are good, but I like trhe original Japanese ones best. I give it four stars not because I was really disappointed, but because they could have drawn it a little better. Ryo's eyes were kind of droopy...."
3,Hmmmm...,"I fell over laughing at the english dubbing. They seriously did everything, particulary the romance scenes, in a monotone. So the english is really bad. But, if you watch the subtitles it's all good. In my opinion, I believe the books are a lot better."
3,Maybe if you're an anime fan . . .,"The boy love content was fun, but overall, this is a thin, silly story, rather like a Scooby Doo episode. And it incorporates all the elements that kept me away from anime for so long: the weird faces, screechy voices, spastic secondary characters (JJ I'm talkin' to you, buddy) who jar painfully in contrast to the better developed (and drawn) heros. The English dubbed voices are mostly awful, with most of the cast sounding like the denizens of a Stonewall era gay bar. Again, the two main characters are a nice exception to this, but I ended up listening to the Japanse audio with subtitles. Those voices are much better.This is a classic, but don't expect ""Cowboy Bebop"" or even ""Trigun"" quality."
3,Traditional Chinese philosophy transformed for Western eyes,"L'Orange is somewhat familiar with ancient Chinese medical philosophy and does attempt to give her readers some grasp of these concepts. The issue is that the Nei Ching, the classic Chinese medical text, does not promote one consistent ""prescription"" for each disease. There are thousands of herbal variations based on a unique diagnosis of each patient. This book tries to simplify a complex system and culture and in the end is not pure Chinese herbal medicine...or at least not what the ancients had in mind. In L'Orange's defense she does attempt to take individual herbal knowledge and translate this information into something meaningful for today's consumer."
1,Don't waste your time,"I would highly recommend passing this book up for a better buy. This book is jam packed with child torture that is simply unacceptable.""p.138 ""As we walk along together shopping, I will suddenly give them silly commands that they must obey without arguing, such as `Walk backward,' or `Stop and touch your toes,' or `Give me a kiss.' Occasionally I'll throw in a real command, like `Don't touch that,' or `No, you may not have an Icee.' My favorite curve, however, is to say no to some reasonable request, like `May I go to the bathroom?'"" ""This is just a small example. Why on earth would anybody want to deny a child the right to use the restroom? This book is riddled with rediculousness that could only serve to raise a child with low self esteem and lack of motivation to do right in society."
1,Don't do this to your kids if you want a healthy relationship with them!,"As a child, my parents used some of these same punishments on me. I still hate and fear them. I can't talk about my mother without getting angry and she's been dead for 13 years now. My relationship with my father is very strained; he complains that I never call him or come over to see him, and frankly, I don't want to have anything to do with him or have him involved in my life at all (although I can't seem to tell him this). Actually, by the time I was a young teen I never answered his questions when I could avoid it, preferring to remain silent because it was safer for me that way. This woman is a terrible parent and those who do these things to their children are terrible parents as well. The truly creative correction is to discipline your children without resorting to violence and fear."
1,Raising Screwed Up Kids 101,"Any parent who follows the techniques in this book is guaranteed to raise children who know how to be controlled but who have very little skill in self-control. Talk about confusing for kids! The author is so afraid her kids will lose trust in her (she should be) that she refuses to allow them to develop trust in themselves. Wow. It's amazing this woman thinks she is an expert on raising kids. If you love your children and want them to grow up well-balanced and confident, don't buy this book!I would have given it zero stars if I had the choice!"
5,Many choices and ideas for different children!,"I have found this book to be incredibly helpful, mostly because for each problem, there are several suggestions for how to handle them. I have two very different children and the same approach rarely works with both. The author collaborated and brainstormed with friends to offer a menu of ideas for problems. Reading the suggestions is like having a group of other mothers with you at those moments when you feel alone and frustrated. It is a wonderful resource. Not every parent will need or use every idea, but it sure is nice to have the choice."
1,Whelchel and I do not have the same God,"I am appalled at this book because I actually bought it at a Christian conference. What type of Christian, or anyone for that matter, would treat his/her child this way? This is what pushes people away from spirituality and God. I actually thought I was buying a book on Creative Correction, not mistreatment of them. Terrible, terrible stuff."
1,Creative Correction,"I wrote a review and you no longer have it posted. If you are not going to list my reviews, I will no longer order anything from Amazon. This is a zero star book. Jerry Townsend, School Psychologist (retired), Christian minister (retired).Jerrnan@aol.com"
5,The book for beginner & those on the path,"I bought this book years ago, with a blue cover. It is a time-less classic, filled with Moon magic, lore, rituals & Deities. I bought this for my daughter, as She is on the path of knowledge of the Moon, to use in rituals.I recommend this book as the one to start with, use often for new information missed on the way. I still go to this book for help, facts and magic!Donna Swindells"
1,Disappointing,"There are far more substantial books on the market than this one. Mrs. Conway has gone the way of other authors who use trite, simplistic prose to turn a quick buck from newbie pagans.Her grasp of history is appalling, and I can only assume that she is confident that those who buy her books are too ignorant to know better.If you are serious about paganism, please choose a more serious author."
5,Does exactly what it supposed to do.,"I've used it with two canon 580ex flash and triggered them using Elinchrom skyport system, I must say the hot shoe fits perfectly and the flashes are triggered each time I use them,, this is the best solution if you have Elinchrom flashes with skyport system and you need to add a small flash to the image.Very strong build and I do recommend it to a friend."
4,good product for the money,"The bike seems to be good over all, I've had it for about a month now. Fan is not working but it not a big deal. Quiet operation.Overall, very good."
5,HEHE so EVIL,"This game makes u hate the good guys ive learned from the demo which was frustrating because not many security features are given but it was awesome to see like 5 agents in your base ""sneaking"" around to be suddenly surrouned by armed guards and regular workers just swarming the good guys and either capturing them or simply killing them and puttem up in the freezer to decompose (kinda wierd thought that freezers preserved not decomposed ah well a furnace would of been better) well anyway its so fun i suggest u get the demo downloaded(go to ign.com and go to evil genius under shearch and the pop up for the demo download pops up everyonce and a while) later"
4,"Dense, clear, factual... A thrill !!!","... A thrill if you can cope with the high-speed, no fuss, complete but concise style, i.e. Smullyan's way at its best !This is the best treatment of tableaux I have come across, nicely covering both propositional logic and first-order logic.Concerning price, contents and clarity of exposition, one can simply forget about the two unjustifiably-praised ""preachers"" of the logic world, i.e. Enderton and Mendelson, and use this book instead.Smullyan covers so much territory and goes so far that the reader -- if not an expert -- will only try to catch the concepts of the last 3 chapters while skipping proofs and details...Concerning this edition : the book is too small, so the text is packed, i.e. titles, sections, paragraphs, important conclusions are not well separated, hence my rating."
2,Save your money!!,"My 4 year old saw this on TV and wanted it for her birthday. Grandma obliged and bought it for her. It worked initially but after about 5 or 6 times it just stopped. It's made of cheap plastic. The doors to the castle don't close, they just flop around. The mechanism for turning is too hard for little hands to turn. We returned it and got the money back."
5,Get the whole series,"The Sound remain one of best rock bands nobody's heard of. Fans of ""post-punk"", who can only have multiplied in the last decade with the rise of groups like Interpol and The Editors, would be well advised to check out any of the reverent re-releases in the last decade.Including this, and the other four Dutch Radio Recordings series. This is the band at various stages of their career, live, in excellent soundboard. Very simple.These are still priced sanely on the used market, and are well worth picking up in hard copy for ""eternity"".Highly recommended to any and all ""post punk"" fans who want to hear how it was done while we were in diapers."
5,Christmas gift,"Was a gift, so did not open package. Grand children love and requested the selection. Package arrived on time before the deadline."
5,One of the greatest movies for girls,"I have loved this movie for over 10 years. Though Kevin Sullivan takes some liberties with LM Montgomery's books, he generally stays true to the general plot and feeling (not something that can be said for part 3!). A movie that can cheer me up any day!"
5,Excellent quality movie,"If you want to see a movie that does not disgrace the book it is based on, then you should see ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea."" I have grown up with these novels, and the movie captures the characters and scenes perfectly. I love them and I'm sure you'll love them."
5,I love this movie,"This was a great movie. It continues from Anne of Green Gables. How she goes on to teach. Then she goes home to Green Gables, and Diana gets married and the ending is the best part of the whole movie, I always cry at the end."
5,"Anne of Green Gables, The Sequel","I love Anne. I enjoy the super scenery, the characters, the life , the townspeople. I feel I have the entertainment world right here at home when my time is ready and my cup of hot tea sits beside me. I take my journey. Above and beyond entertainment of today. excellant family viewing. Treat the kids! Treat yourself. Fix the tea!"
5,Kids in the Hall Fans...,"This is a great movie, a worthy follow-up to the original and classic Anne of Green Gables, and a wise buy. What KITH fans may not know is... both Bruce McCulloch and Dave Foley have small roles in this movie, and it's priceless. :-)"
1,No Sequel At All,"This movie should never have been made - or at the least, not have stolen the names and setting from the Anne series. There is no connection between the movies Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, and this film, other than names. And definitely no connection to the books. It's not even a good story without usurping those names.Besides being set in the wrong time frame, this story has Anne and Gilbert doing things that people of that day would not have done. It is a thin disguise of modern mores, one of the things that makes it unworthy.I would not recommend this movie; in fact, I tell people to not even bother watching it."
4,Finally on DVD,"Gave it as a gift to my sister. She said the sound and video quality were fine. I know some other reviews have stated that the video quality was pretty bad. Guess we got a good copy? The pictures on the box are small and still look really grainy, like they were taken with an early cell phone camera. Anyway, in a world where no one has a VCR anymore, my sister can enjoy this old classic"
1,unhappy,I thought I was getting a white dresser. I know it said antique white but the picture showed it as a very white. Other web sites viewed their off/antique white with an off white color. The color of the dresser I received is almost tan. I feel the dresser I viewed on your web site was misleading. I have been trying to return the item for three weeks.
4,A must read for any theatre lover!,"I stumbled across this ""Staging Gay Lives"" when I was despertley looking for the play, ""What's Wrong With Angry?"" by Patrick Wilde. This play became the base for a very popular queer film called, ""Get Real"". This book of 10 queer themed plays was the only place I could find this play. After getting the book, I also enjoyed the other 9 plays that were in the book. This book of plays, is a must read for any theatre lover out there. Weather gay or straight, I think that anyone can appreciate the sincere realism of these 10 beautifuly written plays."
3,pretty good,"better than expected, some of the acting was a bit B-rated but overall kept my interest. The ending was a little too simple and quick."
5,Just Like Frank Peretti's Work!,"I have read many of Frank Peretti's books and I love it. After the movie, I am totally convince that this movie is very much like what Frank Peretti had written. If you haven't read his books, I would not recommend watching this movie. It is the only way that you will understand what Frank Peretti's is trying to sell his story."
4,Good place to start for first time pug owners,Proved to be a good introduction for first time pug owners. It is easy to read and a well rounded survey of pug-related issues and topics.
4,"Nice, however stand supplied is unfinished wood","This set is of good quality and the stand is indeed sturdy. The stand however unlike the description which refers you to the inaccurate pictures is unfinished wood, it is not stained, varnished, nor sealed. We currently employ ours with a 3 gallon bottle which is ample enough for our second floor consumption. Finally, my experience with this seller's customer service was nothing short of professional and courteous."
4,Good XML code and application examples in PHP,"Chapters two and three start the book with good examples of SAX and DOM use in PHP respectively. This provides a solid foundation for the rest of the book which shows examples of popular XML based technologies as applied to PHP. These include XSLT (Sablotron), XML-RPC, SOAP, XML in databases and other topics. Each of these discussions contains some real world examples to provide context.It's a short and concise book that is well written. The use of graphics could be more effective. For example the screenshot in figure 6.8 is a single line in a vast sea of whtie browser space. The code sample could use some annotation or at the very least some bolding to hi-light the important segments.The value of this book will depend on the degree to which you use XML in the PHP context. If you want a quick booster rocket to get you into SAX or DOM work within PHP this book will do the trick since it's far better than the documentation on the PHP site."
2,"Okay, but look to Wrox's PHP Book","This book contains all the fundamental information you'd expect from a book detailing PHP and XML, however this book fails to cover anything extremely indepth. If you are looking for a more in-depth and technical resource as well as coverage of the latest standards, turn to the Professional PHP4 XML book published by Wrox. That one is much better even though it's a little more money."
1,Absolutely Junk,"After reading most of the book, I've concluded that this book is for amateurs. If you want to learn a little bit of XML, but nearly enough to do large projects, then maybe this book will be good for you. But once you need to do a large project or you need some actual advance over and beyond the syntax, concepts and APIs, the books won't help you; it's not even up to date in some areas. However the book is very easy to read, so I give it 1 star. However, there are better books that describe PHP and XML in much greater detail and in a way that is still very inviting to new comers. If you want to truely get the best knowledge for your buck, don't by this book. The Wrox book seems like a better choice so I'm going to pick that up next. I'm going to sell this book."
5,I really liked the Herbal Essences shampoo. I ...,"I really liked the Herbal Essences shampoo. I usually buy the very expensive beauty shop shampoo, especially just after having a perm. I decided to try the Herbal Essences instead this time. I was very pleased that my hair didn't get frizzy and was extremely manageable after using it. The price is much, much more affordable, the shampoo leaves my hair shiny, and it still looks like it did the day I had my perm. I've decided to keep using it and will buy it in the future. I really like this product."
3,Size problems,"The description for this product is very misleading. It says it is for ""your Bratz Babyz,"" which are the 8"" dolls. Then it says it is for your ""large Bratz Babyz."" Are ""large"" babyz the same as Bratz ""Big"" Babyz, which are 13""? It was marketed with a Bratz Babyz, NOT a Bratz Big Babyz -- so we ordered the smaller doll. They are terribly mismatched. The bathtub is for the Bratz BIG Babyz (not ""large,"" which doesn't appear anywhere on the packaging of the dolls) and they should not be featured with the regular sized 8"" dolls. Very frustrating."
1,based on my experience i do not recomend,i do not recomend this mousse basically because it does not have the mega hold it says it does. it didn't shape my curls and it didn't hold my curls. if i put my hair in a pony tail then the curls disappeared. if i went to sleep the curls would disappear. you get the idea. i also recall this mousse saying that it eased frizz or something like that. that was just another promise it didn't fulfill. basically don't believe anything this mousse promises because it is all lies.
1,Another AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL mousse from L'Oreal,"This mousse is AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL! It made my curls stick together, it did NOT work against frizz (so I had frizzy hair around my face and on the top layer of my hair) and it didn't hold. My hair is naturally curly, so I just need a little something to help my hair along and improve what I already had but this mousse made my hair worse. I would have been better without it! That is pretty lame that a mousse couldn't even provide a tiny amount of help for me.My sister's hair isn't as curly so she uses mousse to increase her curl, but this mousse didn't work for her either.So, whether you are looking for curl or already have it, this mousse doesn't seem to work and it makes your hair look really bad (i.e. frizzy, gloppy, etc.). SO SPEND YOU MONEY ON ANOTHER PRODUCT!"
2,poor quality,"Although the phone actually works, reception and overall quality is poor. Purchased for kids rooms because they were ""fun"" looking would spend more next time for a better phone."
1,Vcrap gz5838 - 5.8 GHz V Mix Cordless,"...I was dismayed to find that while the phone is on/in-use for only a few seconds it start making an annoying static loud noise and no one can hear me...I tried several other phones with the same line and I was able to confirm that it was a defective/flimsy product ""DiscountsJungle"" sent me...it was their fault, but they still charged me 25% restocking fee and return s&h. Avoid buying this product."
5,6 Stars!,This a veritable Bible for ESL/EFL teachers. Wright crams this excellent book with ideas that will help bring out the creative teacher and get everyone away from the often tedious textbook. The book is easy to use and can be browsed casually or worked through more systematically. I recommend the latter approach and suggest that ideas and activities can be used in all aspects of classroom work. A definite top 3 ELT books contender!
5,"amazing show, RELEASE SEASON 2!!!","although i am young (22) and was even younger when the series originally aired (9) i DO remember it. in fact i remember that it was one of my favorite shows much to my parents' dismay and i accredit it greatly for my twisted sense of humor and taste for the bizaare and absurd. when i found out that season 1 was released on dvd i snatched it up, and after digesting that (and purchasing the import, region-free pilot DVD) i need more. its been so long that it is like watching it all for the first time for me, and although i distinctly remember the series resolution, i wish to re-experience all of season two.in short DAMMIT Lions Gate/Artisan, release it.from what i'm hearing, there are many foreign releases set for the end of this year, and with any luck they will surprise us with at least part one of season 2 here.it will be on my xmas list at the very least.keep your fingers crossed, and keep those internet petitions going!!!!!"
3,I don't believe this,"I am so happy to see that season 2 is coming out on dvd. I am a huge fan of the series, even the all the quarkiness of season 2. However i am not happy that they pulled season 1. What is up with that? i finally get myself together financially and i estatic about buying both dvd sets and they pull season 1??? please someone tell me that they will start selling season 1 again. if not who do i have to complain to????"
3,I haven't seen this season in almost 3-4 years...,"...So please Artisan, I will pay whatever ridiculous amount of money you want for the second season. Just please release it and make it pretty, for all us Peakies out here!"
3,"This episode contain the F-word, uncensored if streamed",I was watching this episode on N'tflix and had top replay the scene at 00:20:00 to 00:20:25 the woman clearly is heard using the F-word.I wondered how this was on broadcast. I don't remember the show having any bleeps. This was creepy. The scene where that FBI agent says he love the Sheriff....creepy. Creepy show.
4,Give it to us!,I feel it is my civic duty to post a request for the release of Season 2. After watching season 1 I'm reminded how brilliant and cutting edge this series was when it first aired. I'm dying for more!
5,Does no one understand our TP addiction?,"OK -- for those of you who are fellow ""Twin Peakers,"" you probably know what I'm talking about when I say I'm so addicted to the series! I remember being intrigued by the show way back when it originally came out -- I could not get enough.I recently bought the 1st season on DVD and have already finished the first seven episodes and am craving more. I'd prefer to buy the 2nd season on DVD, but may be forced to get the VHS copies. That just seems so stupid! Even if they only released us TP-2nd series through either special orders or for a limited time, I know my fellow TP addicts would purchase the product. What's the hold up? Somebody...if you're reading, please help!"
5,get used to it,"Well folks, here we are again. For all you newcomers to the wonderful world of Twin Peaks, this random and awkward delay is nothing new. When the first VHS tapes came out we got episodes one through seven, each on their own tape... Then, when the rest came out...it was a huge set that included all of the 3 seasons. I got ...., and had to buy eps. 1-7 again, as many many others did also.Then when the fabulous DVD set came out, i lept like a lemming over the figgin cliff that was right in front of me and yet I could not see it. THE PILOT NOT INCLUDED. OK OK, I still love the show, BUT I would not be the least bit surprised if sometime in May or so out pops the complete series on DVD, leaving all of us to buy buy buy it over again... Great show, terribly american marketing system.h"
2,You will get what you paid for,"For such a small price, what else could you expect? This is a home made video with poor production and editing quality. The 2 videos can be put inside one VHS Cassete with no trouble. The information on the 2 Videos is good, in fact is the same you will find in any survival book, for the same price (with even more information), but with the VISUAL Advantage; THAT IS GOOD. In general terms DO NOT EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM THIS VIDEO, is short, some times concise, and give you the visual process of many out doors survival activities. You will get what you paid for. A very good beginning point, if you dislike to read a good book"
3,OK for beginners,"This tae bo instruction is perfect for beginners, who have never done that before. It is divided in two parts: The work out routine is fun but I would have preferred if there was at least another routine. It gets boring after you repeated the same routine several times. Well I guess the idea is to sell more work out videos... Anyway after a while you want to move on to a more advanced work out. The instructional part explains the basics and especially the moves used in the routine in a way easy to understand. I recommend purchasing this DVD although you better get a couple of more advanced or different tae bo routines as well."
4,Holds straps in place!,"I love the Strap-mate. I use it everyday. I originally bought the nude color, which I love. Then I bought the clear ones because I have other colored bras. The clear ones are obviously made of plastic and are itchy. But I love the fabric ones!"
5,They Really Work!!!,"I have shoulders that are like coat hangers, they slant down and my bra straps are forever slipping, HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IS THAT? I am amazed that they truly work... It is worth the price to not be tugging on my bra straps all day long.... LOVE THEM."
5,Fantastic Read,"""Making the Impossible Possible"" is an easy to read textbook for success. This book is a must for everyone's self help library! Jason's TAB Plan has enabled me to accelerate my business plans and helped me to set goals that I am now able to achieve."""
1,video not real good,everything was good as far as the seller goes but the video was the worst I have ever seen from Aerosmith.It was so bad I will never watch it again.
4,Great film!,"Lo recomiendo totalmente. Magnífico retrato de como se puede destruir por la intolerancia, un país. una ciudad, todo un pueblo."
2,Either over my head or just not very good,"Like other reviewers, my hopes were pretty high after The Nanny Diaries. Although I have never been a nanny, I went through all the emotions in that book because it was so well written. Not so with Citizen Girl. Maybe that is what it is like to be a woman trying to make it in the big city, but it was just too far fetched for me to buy in to. I know the struggle to find work is very real but things like the authors' unimaginative names like Girl for the main character and My Company for the corporation she works for make everything that follows seem surreal. I was also disappointed by the ending, I know not everything can end happily but anything would have been better than what they wrote. I wouldn't recommend buying this one, but hold out for their next book because it's got to be better!"
1,What. Was. That?!?,"I picked this book out to read on a whim... having heard good reviews about The Nanny Diaries... figured I would give this book a shot as I wanted ""something new"". New is what I got in that never have I seen such crap published before outside of ""Letters to the editor"" of a small town newspaper.Honestly. It is terrible. The characters are so overly obnoxious yet so thinly engaged it is hard to follow which A-Hole is currently being written about.The lack of a spine by the main character, blandly named Girl, is hard to root for. You want her to fail.I soldiered on willing the plot to get better. It never did.SKIP reading this book and watch paint dry. Your time will have been better spent."
1,Just re-read The Nanny Diaries instead,"Loved The Nanny Diaries, but this book is just not worth it. The trite device of not giving the title character a name was the first really annoying affectation...and it went down hill from there. Didn't even bother finishing it. The non name thing worked in Nanny diaries as she was ""the help"" but why go back to that well? It's dry. Not in a good way either...."" Girl ""...really? REALLY? Augh.What happened? The Nanny Diaries was a great feminist chic lit book - a fun read but with depth. This read like a required term paper, but made less sense. Poorly drawn characters, lame plot devices...thin overall. Not believable for a minute. We all know that they can do better than this. Save your cash, get it from the library and then return it after chapter 3 when you realize that there is nothing there."
2,dreary - the bad judgement of youth in a bad economy,"only a lack of other reading material had me finish this. She is young, clueless, and unemployed, and goes from one bad job to another. Almost everyone is mean to her, and she tries her best ... but...I supposed this is supposed to reflect some of the web 1.0 / dot com era insanity, some of it is true, but its not that entertaining to read about."
1,Ugh! What IS this?,"Like most of the other reviewers I really enjoyed ""The Nanny Diaries,"" and ""Citizen Girl"" really fell short of my expectations. I am a fast reader but I honestly had to force myself to finish this book just because I can't stand to have read part of a book. Now I wish I hadn't. It's hard to ever start caring about ""Girl."" The generic naming of everything was a bit over the top. So much of it seems ridiculously far fetched. I understand it's satire, but it's so poorly written that it doesn't work. No matter how much you like ""The Nanny Diaries,"" don't waste your time on this!"
1,Girl sells out,"I really wanted to like this book because I identified with the first 20 pages or so. I myself am a young female professional working for not-for-profit organizations, and struggling with how to make a career out of it. Then the story changed, and veered off into completely unrealistic and bizarre situations. I was tempted to just stop reading, but I was hoping for some revenge, comeuppance, or for Girl to grow a spine. But there was no satisfaction for me in this regard. Girl sucks.Ultimately this story is about selling out and compromising your principles to get ahead, and continuing to do so, despite the little voice inside your head screaming ""Nooooo!"" Maybe this is appealing to other people in the world, but it strikes me as pretty shallow and it's not what I'm looking for in a novel."
1,Epilogue Please,"I am inspired to write my first review ever because I have been thinking about Citizen Girl off and on all day. I listened to this book ontape and the performance of the reader was very good so I kept listening. Up until the end I was annoyed by the main character's naivete, the preposterous situations she found herself in, the raunchy language, and the general lack of any real character development but some parts were funny and the aformentioned reader was good so I kept plugging along thinking well this is no award winner but it will do to pass the time while driving to and from work. And then abruptly it was over. And I mean abruptly. The end was so dissapointing that the whole book suffered and my rating dropped from 2 maybe even 3 stars to 1. The authors could have kept their stars with a well crafted epilogue."
2,Jobs and Feminism,"Girl wanted to do something with her life, help people, help women. Initially she works for Doris, at the job from hell, yet she is fired and must begin the job search again. Her new job at My Company turns out to be difficult in its own right. She is hired to bring feminism to a website, to bring a certain kind of woman to the company. This task is hard given the people is works with.The events of this book are laid out with what I thought was a lack of specific detail and descripition that made it hard to relate to the jobs, and the characters. The generic names are suppose to make it seem ""normal"", but the lack of description makes it hard to become absorbed. The book gets better towards the second half, and does have a surprising ending, but I didn't get involved with the characters. Girl didn't love her work, and kept whining about getting fired. While she didn't love what she was doing, I didn't love this book."
3,1978,"There's much to like in this book for Clash obsessives like myself. However, the author is still stuck in the rut where punk bands were held to ridiculous standards, many self imposed, and this comes across as snobbery. His disdain for Joe Strummer is very obvious. Apparently, to the author, a middle class English person is not allowed to sing about being on the dole in England, but can sing about the USA, South America and the Spanish Civil War. I have always suspected the writer doesn't quite believe all this but, you know, street credibility counts.There was a time when 17 years olds had to be in either the ""I love the Clash and I hate the Jam"" club or the ""I love the Jam and I hate the Clash"" club. The writing in reminiscent of this.For Clash fans, a great amount of detail."
2,Burns my scalp!,This product burns my scalp and doesnt get rid of my dandruff.Ive tried cutting down my use of this product so that I wouldnt cause irritation to my scalp but Im deciding to give up on it because I dont need to be in pain when I wash my hair for no results anyway.I have contacted the company because I am that unsatisified with this product. Its a shame because I really love nuetrogena products and this is the only time that I have had an issue with something they make.
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought a bottle of this, and they sent me two, by accident I imagine. I have psoriasis, with a few spots on my scalp. Hoped this would help out, but I didn't see a difference, I used both bottles, and let it soak in my hair for plenty of time when showering. Didn't see any results. Decent shampoo though, hair feels clean."
2,"Authenticity, anyone?","I love African music of every stripe, and I am not foolish enough to assume that traditions are immutable and that modification is unspeakable. I still cannot quite accept this as the music of North Africa. These CDs explore modern styles by modern artists whose only claim to their ethnic and regional underpinnings is the fact that they sing primarily in Arabic. I don't think I am passing thoughtless judgment. Yazoo Records released a brilliant bonfire of an album entitled Secret Museum of Mankind: Music of North Africa, which showcases recordings from the 20s and 30s. That CD is indispensable, the music is endlessly mysterious. The music on the CD under review is enjoyable yet culturally flat and irrelevant."
4,great book!,This is a great book that can introduce to the young part of the process that goes into making a piece of pottery. My 3 year old loves to read it!
1,No Show,I never received the item from the company and after waiting three weeks and sending the company emails about the purchase they finally refunded my money and told me that I could reorder the item. Like I would trust them after I did not receive the battery the first time.
2,Unfullfilling 'Fantasm' - A Wasted Promise...,"The other reviewer must live in a closet - this flick is a waste of your time and cash. Sure, it`s got hardcore actors and porn stars headlining (no pun intended), but there`s NOTHING sexy, revealing or amusing going on, and the other reviewer is hallucinating when he states that some of the sex isn`t simulated - it`s all BADLY simulated, so it makes me wonder if he`s ever had sex (with a partner, that is). This is tedious viewing for ten year olds -IGNORE the 'X rating', this stuff would only get an 'R rating' in today`s world. Incredibly boring when compared to what is actually available on Amazon when it comes to 70`s sexploitation. And while we`re on the subject, the first 'Fantasm' also sucked - find your filth elsewhere, 'Fantasm' is a fantasy frustratingly unfullfilled."
1,I gave a one star cuz there wasn't a grade less than that,"After reading ""The art of the deal"" I was pretty impressed with Donald Trump as an author and as an entrepreneur. This book has too much focus on How Apprentice was shot (first as well as 2nd), the way his schedules looked during those times, and other trivial details. Few others that he brags about were giving tips, DT burger and grill, Trump tower, his apperances on TV shows; Most of the information provided in this book is common sense. He also gives credit and praises a lot of celebrities, though I think this is a great quality, he over did that. I am glad I just listened to the audio rather than sitting and reading the book. Moreover, I didn't buy the book, I checked it out from the library, he he he. So follow me or ""You're Fired"" !!!"
1,Complete fluff -- fire the Donald,"Donald Trump has written some interesting and useful books (The Art of the Deal, Surviving at the Top) but his Think Like a Billionaire is complete fluff. Purporting to be ""everything you need to know about success, real estate and life,"" his advice is short and simplistic. He does a list of the best of various things and cites McDonalds as the best hamburger in the world.Many of the photos have the first name of people who are not mentioned in the text. The end of the book has photos of his employees with no names at all. His fiancee Melania is in just about every picture with a strange glare on her face--very unbecoming. Is she trying to imitate the Trump grimace? Trump prides himself on being the epitome of quality. He has failed miserably here."
1,Worst book you could ever buy,"I have never written a review for anything, but this book requires one. Don't get me wrong, I admire this guy. But there is absolutely nothing you can gain from this book other than how to make millions in a book deal, even if the book doesn't deserve it. He has spent more time on his introduction than on his topics. He might not have spent even five minutes on each topic. (You can't believe the number of topics he has covered). Each topic is a one liner like he gives in his Apprentice show. If you buy this book even after reading this review you deserve what you get, just like I did buying the book after reading one of the negative reviews."
1,Trump's Billionaire Let Down,This was nothing more than a self-promotion of Trump and his various business ventures. It offers nothing new to even a novice business person. Reading People magazine could probably help more if one is interested in finding words to help them make a billion dollars.
1,there is a better way to spend money,"While no one can deny Trump's entrepreneurial abilities and real estate knowledge - he should be fired as a writer.This book is worse than ""Trump: how to get rich"" - the latter one can at least pass for an autobiography while this one is just a number of words put together with little story line or anything resembling it.Added tons of empty space - probably half the book is blank - and simple common sense statements: ""Be frugal"", ""Value your family"", ""Chose vocation you love"", ""Learn from the best"" (e.g. ""buy my book"") - the book is just another way to expand The LEGEND of Trump!Thus, as always, the main idea could be summed up as ""Look at me! I am so filthy rich - it's so nice to be rich! I am such a good business man - I am so tough! bla-bla-bla...""Is it worth the price? I don't know - it's your choice."
1,Do not buy!!!!,"If your looking for a book about a guy that's full of himself, this is it. If your looking for a book about finance, real estate and making money, this isn't it! Plus, he adds a section about The Apprentice at the end, it really didn't help me out one bit. I was really disappointed in this book, wasn't at all what I thought it would be."
1,Absolute rubbish,"Complete waste of time and money. I wish I'd never bought it, save yourself the mistake."
2,Below Standard.,"This book does a good job highlighting certain aspects of Donald Trump's lifestyle. Formatted for an easy/quick read, each chapter covers two pages or less. Thinking like a billionaire requires creativity. Here in this book you may discover a small trail of that which at least points out to you where to start, although you may get or feel ""Trumpmarized"" by him constantly reminding you of his brand.Trump, in my opinion, only scratches the surface in writing about the title of the book. He is very frugal with his words of wisdom. If you want to be a billionaire, you will definitely need to go through more volumes of material and books and painstaking experiences then just reading this book only.If he is going to endorse books like this, he should quit calling himself an author. Mediocre material such as you find in this book does not live up to his moniker. Do not expect to think, act, breath, or even become a billionaire by reading this book."
3,about success,"Everything you need to know about success, real estate, and life"" is in this book, instead there are some gems here and there and you won't find anything really profound.Needless to say that the Donald is an icon, a legend of the American Dream and all success-hungry people can look to him as a shining example of that.I ALSO RECOMMENDED THE BOOK SEX AND THE PERFECT LOVER BY MABEL IAM, THE BEST OF THIS YEAR"
3,So - So.........,"This pendant was cute, but much smaller than the picture portrayed it. The quality was good, but not what I was looking for. Would not have bought it if I knew how small it really was."
5,A great Smalltalk perspective on the GoF patterns.,"This book presents in an excellent way the GoF patterns from a Smalltalk perspective. By showing how the design pattern intent is resolved with a Smalltalk perspective, it provides more than just an implementation of the patterns in Smalltalk. It offers complete new views on the problems that the GoF pattern where solving. A must for every Smalltalk programmer that is not accointed with C++."
4,A Really Nice Introduction to the Gundam Universe,"When I picked this movie series, I had been wanting to see the original TV series something fierce but sadly, it was only available in English up until recently on DVD. I was finally able to pick up this set online and I fell in love with the set instantly. Now, this is NOTHING like Gundam Wing as in style so if you're thinking that, you may as well give up looking right now. But if you were EVER curious as to HOW Mobile Suit Gundam came to be, this is your chance to get a good grasp of it without grabbing the entire 56 episode TV series as the three movies give you a good chunk of what happened in those 52 episodes in about 6-8 hours. So again, if you're at all interested in the origins of how Gundam started, I highly recommend picking these movies up at some point. These movies ARE from the 70's though so keep that in mind. Their animation has been restored but they are older animation than you're probably accustomed to."
5,I definitely liked this product. The scent was ...,"I definitely liked this product. The scent was light and fresh smelling. It had a rich lather that would rinse out and feel squeaky-clean. I liked the color of the product in the bottle -- it had a rich, inviting look to it. The bottle was easy to use and handle. The shampoo left my hair feeling clean and easy to manage. It felt soft, but still under control. I'd definitely recommend this shampoo."
3,Xtreme!!!,"This toy is really cute! they have everything for the pufect surfing day. it has:2 plastic dogs, 2 surfboards, a fake sandcastle with a pail and a bucket, lifejacket, floating ring for them, there is even more where that came from!!hope you get it too!"
4,pretty and perfect,"I really like this dress, however the size chart is way off. I ordered a size bigger than I wear because I have wide hips, turns out I had to return it and get a size smaller than what I wear(that was a plus for my self esteem!!) The dress is a little short to wear alone(if you're on the tall side)but it looks super cute with tights and is perfect for any formal gathering...or just to wear around the house just for the heck of it. I give it an A."
3,Prom Dress,"I purchased this dress for my daughter, however, when she received it it was too short and a little tight. We have returned the dress, and now waiting for the refund. It was a beautiful dress but we could not use it. Could you look into when we will get our refund, it's been a week since PacificPlex received it."
2,Cool at first and then gets boring,"This is the first death metal album i bought, and at first i was really into it. Now for some reason, it just is boring to me. It is well done music, and is great if you only listen to it once in a long while. But nothing to go crazy over. Not addicting at all, and it doesn't have me screaming for more."
2,Poor Printing Quality,I just received this book and am very disappointed with the quality of the printing. Many of the interior and exterior photos are either low-resolution pushed up in scale or out of focus to begin with. The print colors too are quite poor. It's a real shame as the content itself has potential. In books such as this it is the image that takes precedent over the text and someone certainly dropped the ball in the proof-approval process!
1,Dorothy adult costume- think twice before buying,I absolutely agree. The fit was awful and the dress is scratchy. The one piece costume was very cheesy looking. Never would recommend to anyone to buy it.
5,Off the charts,"This cd i str8, if ur a juvenile fan get this right now. I'm just glad that he came out with a new cd since tha G-code, which i thought wasn't that good. Project English is much better."
2,Worst Ever for Cash money,"This CD is horrible do not waste your money the only song that is even ok is ""Set it off"""
2,"PROJECT HISTORY,August 22,2001","I bought Juvenile's new CD Project english it was such a real big fat disappointment, I even told myself that I was not going to listen to no more after being bought from the record store. It shocked me when I was lisening to tracks like Set it Off HeadBusta Be gone In The Molia were the only tracks were worth listening to, so save your money folks cause it ain't worth buying if you want it so so bad. I think the problems about this CD were tha lack of beats and sounds were not like Tha G Code and 400 Degreez plus it sucks needs to be recycled at Cassh Money recycling center, so I am making a copy of the only ones that were sharp then sell it to sombeody who might like it, I don't care about tha haters but what I'm sayin' is really really true. To all my dawgs who are CashMoney millionare fans do not I repeat don't think about orderin' buyin' purcahsin' this CD because it's a waste of time!!!! Da-hey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,so-so,"not as bad as ""Juve the great."" Set it off i like. it's funny because it sounds like Sherlock Holmes. ""Mamma's got a**"" is good too. sounds like a ride you'd hear at a carnival; carnival music. Still you can pass on this."
2,"While it seemed to work, the product had ...","While it seemed to work, the product had a thin, watery consistency. I had to use twice as much as I do with Neutrogena T-Gel, because it kept running out of my hand. The smell wasn't nearly as pleasant and the lather was disappointing too. All things considered, I'd have to say """"pass."""""
5,Wild America Specials 7-12 DVD Set,"I got this as a gift and really enjoyed it. As a guy who enjoys the outdoors, going hunting and fishing and even just hiking through the woods, this goes with my lifestyle. Anyone who has similar tastes should check this out."
5,Resurrection review,Ressurrection by Steve Alten is a wonderful trip in to the imagination. Going down a road that takes mythology and makes the reader believe it could happen. Every page you read makes you want to keep reading. Never a dull moment. Pure excitement to the end of time. looking forward to Phobos!
1,A waste of money.,"I bought this book on the recommendation of my repairman, James Keyes.The contents of this book are interesting, giving some (not much, but some) insight into how a reed actually works. However, a sketchy quality of writing makes it hard to follow with the very few examples provided.It doesn't end there. The instructions and methods provided to produce the various reed models mentioned in the book are completely useless; every reed I've made following his instructions has failed even if I followed them to the exact letter.Interesting if you want to see how Louis Skinner worked. But if you want to use the book for practical purposes, don't bother."
3,EH its ok.,This shampoo definitely cleans your head but I needed something medicated for a reason and it hasnt helped with what I needed it for.
2,This just did not work for me at all,"Maybe this product works for some people, but it did not work for my hair. My dandruff is still the exact same as it was before I used it. I don't really like the smell either, although that wasn't a big deal. I've tried other dandruff shampoos like Nizoral and they've been a lot more effective."
1,WARNING! DO NOT BUY FROM HERE,"I was planning to buy this printer from Amazon for 45 dollars. All good and well. The supplier was Skybox USA.But then, one week later, after I added it to my cart, lo and behold, it wouldn't move from my ""saved items"" to my actual shopping cart.So naturally, I come back to this page, only to discover... Skybox has been replaced by this insidious ""Toyzz"" supplier, and the price doubled to 92 dollars, plus shipping! What is this? So I did some more searching, to find other sites sold this for... $30-$45 dollars!!! What kind of outrageous company would dare replace another supplier.. and then double the price?Do not buy from this ""Toyzz"" supplier!"
2,no bargain,The printer works fine BUT....it uses HP21 cartridges which have a very limited life. It is nice the printer is so inexpensive but once you add in all those replacement cartridges it is no bargain and perhaps a very expensive item.
3,Pretty good,"This is a nice printer especially for the money. There are a few problems. Paper jams are a common occurance. It does take a tad too long to print also, but I did not expect great things for a cheap printer. It does the job and doesn't hurt the pocketbook."
2,Fair- still cheap,"You get what you pay for. This printer would jam on me or take way too long to print. I purchased it so my lady can generate her print outs at home on her own, without waiting for me to print them out at work for her. Its now gathering dust."
1,NO USB CABLE AND NO BLACK INK,"I knew I wasn't getting black ink, but no usb cable is just ridiculous. It's like buying a lawnmower and it not having the blade. Absurd."
4,Depends on the test you take,"Sigh...I can understand both the positive and the negative reviews. I got this book the first time I tried to pass this test, and it didn't help. I got another book and tried to do the test again using the second book I purchased (stay with me here). Ironically, this book would have been a better study guide for the second test I took. My conclusions? Get (and study) more than one study guide until Praxis gets the test a little more consistent. Good luck to all taking this test - Reading Specialists are needed, and bless you for being a teacher!!"
5,Amazing Solution,This product is awesome! It will send your cable TV signals just about anywhere... No need to drill holes! Just install this great device. Picture and sound quality are not bad at all!Very impressed! Strongly recommend!
1,Don't buy this!,"My sentiments and opinions are articulated perfectly in the previous review by B. Ross. This is not the original album. The original was a sublime work of art, unknown to many but greatly appreciated by a few. I only wish that I had read the review by B. Ross before I made my purchase. Financial support of this type of blatant ripoff is a lamentable mistake; don't do it, it will only encourage the charlatans that masquerade as musicians."
5,Excellent Review Book!,This is an excellent review book! I have read many board review books for my recent family practice board recertification. This book is the best although it is a first edition. It uses problem oriented approach and it teaches you along the way. It is well organized and covers all the systems in Family Practice. The answer and explanation follow the question immediately which is brilliant! I retain more facts and I really enjoy reading this review. (I usually fall asleep reading text book) It may take about 10 days to read the book throughly but it does worth it.
2,Don't waste your money...,I started off LOVING this game but after spending hours and hours wandering around Moria fighting the same things over and over and over and..(you get the point)..What could have been a great game was spoiled by one simple ommision..Maps..Never have I played a game with such a BAD map system..(I got SO frustrated the game came close to being snapped in half a few times)..I never did bother finishing it..waste of time..
2,Mindless Entertainment - Makes you want to watch movies,"First off, a 4 year old could solve this game, since you have no choice but to move in only one direction, and there is virtually no way to fail. Battles are very easy, environment interaction is non-existent, and enjoyment is minimal at best. All this game has inspired in me is a desire to see the movies again. Possibly the entire point? Save your money and just buy the movies. It's basically the same thing. Overall, the worst game I've played in years. Fortunatley I only rented it. Oh yeah, have had it one week, played 20 hours, and 90% done."
2,"Repetitious, poor characterization, boring","This game had a lot of potential; it barely lived up to minimal expectations. If There is one thing a video game shouldn't be, its BORING. This game didn't challenge the player in any real way - once a strategy was found, it could be used throughout the entire game.Terrible characterization. After 30 hours of gameplay, I don't even remember my main characters' names. There was nothing memorable about anyone in my party.Battles felt like FFX but without the fun. Switching party members in and out of battle felt like a chore. All the monsters, save a few bosses, used the same animation/artwork throughout the entire game. There are only so many times you can kill a party of orcs/goblins without getting tired of it."
1,Melted in transit,"I will never order chocolates during summer time again. It came all melted, deformed and tasteless."
2,received,Book is mostly black and white...not a lot of variety for clown faces but some good history.It will not stay in my collection.
4,Unconstitutional,"I saw this video online and wanted a copy. Everyone should see this video for the information it contains about real history. People need to wake up and in a hurry.I got my copy for a very low price. It got here really quick and was in excellent shape. The four stars were for the movie, not for the seller, who gets a big A+."
4,So handy,These are great for chocolate (which I really don't want to put in my featherweight bags) and for quick jobs. You can actually reuse them but when you need to you can just chuck them when you're done.The only things is that loose tips don't work too well with them.
3,Derivative?,"Listen to Keith Jarrett's ""Sundial/Sand"" album and you'll find that Gismonti's style owes a great deal -- perhaps a bit too much, actually -- to Mr. Jarrett's earlier grooves.I loves the bass/guitar pieces on this album: They're fantastic. But when Gismonte hits the boards, I feel like I'm hearing a cross between a Jarrett knockoff and a late-80s Windam Hill album.Definitely a mixed bag."
2,"NRSV Gift & Award Bible, Blue Leatherflex","On-screen description says ""leather bound"", but it's really cheap cardboard. Suitable for a 3rd grader's first Bible, maybe, but not as a gift for an adult. Really cheap in appearance, and the illustrations incorporated are directed at children, not adults. Should be promoted as ""Children's Gift & Award Bible""."
1,This stuff is garbage!,"The Ichabod Conk cologne is just colored water, with almost no identifiable scent and zero staying power. Never again."
1,zounds! ripped off again!,"This stuff really rates less than zero stars. It's supposed to be lime scented but it wasn't. I don't know what it smelled like but it was very, very bad.I ordered Royale Lyme aftershave to replace it. It is great, but alittle expensive. Of course Colonel Ichabod Conk was much more expensive; I just wasted money on it."
2,SporTube Series 3,"SporTube Series 3 Snowboard or Multi-Ski Travel CaseI purchased this product for one set of skiis and ski poles thinking I could also fit my ski boots and maybe a ski jacket. The airlines restrict the weight of your skiis and boot bag to 50 lbs. The SporTube weighs 14 lbs. so you now have only 36 lbs. I could not fit both ski boots in with the skiis so my boot bag was 12 lbs.,my skiis,poles,and one ski jacket weighed 24 lbs. and the 14 lb. SporTube equaled the 50 lb. limit."
2,HEAVVVVYYYY!,"I guess I should have expected it, but this case is heavy (and I'm no weak fluffy bunny). Empty - it's heavy. Filled - it's ridiculously heavy. It's more suited for taking on car trips but I wouldn't recommend flying with it. It's easier to rent your snowboard/skis on the slopes than try and drag this behemoth around unless you're really hardcore attached to your gear. So we're using it to store our gear but we won't be flying anywhere with it.There's some kind of service that will ship your SporTube to your destination but for the money, hassle and lugging it around it's still probably better to rent, unfortunately."
4,pretty good,"These days it is cheaper to rent when you get to your destination than to fly with one of these things...however it did fit very comfortably, 2 pairs of skis, 2 pairs of poles, hats, mittens all the gear you need for your skiing experience. It would fit 3 pairs very easily but then you have to pack all the bulky clothing in your suit case...."
2,Dissappointed. Expected more.,"Sorry to have to give this one a bad review but it is necessary. I have been a fan of Dannion's for a long time. The interview is interesting if you have never heard anything about or from him but this video could have been so much more. Here you have one of the most interesting people on earth and this video, I believe, was shot in a hotel room in front of a large glass window with people constantly walking by. That was distracting.Dannion did generally outline and talk about his experiences but there was little visual imagery to back it up. I have seen several pieces on him that were done for TV that were better. Although the story of his life is fascinating, he is just sitting in a chair and telling about it. There are a few cut-aways to home movies of him growing up, etc but there is not much dept there. His abilities can amaze you when he is having a good reading with someone. This video did not show an example or delve into that very much. ..."
5,Nice,These were really nice. The handle says cool and the cup comes out of the handles and rim for easy cleaning. Good Price. Great Product.
2,3 out of 4 were great,Glasses were great only problem was one of them looked like it was all cracked up. It still held expresso it just looks bad. But for the price having three out of the four glasses being nice i won't complain too much.
2,Not what the doctor ordered,"I had a waterpik which started having problems after a year (planned obsolescence, LA water...Who knows). I bought this hoping for better longevity but it is disappointing. I like the layout of the reservoir and controls but it is not nearly as powerful as the water pick and the reservoir is way to small. Just my opinion (humble as it may be)"
4,Interplak Dental Water Jet,"This machine is kind of small and light weight. Controls are tight and need both hands to handle it. Consider the cost of the machine, I can live with it. It works very well for me. I like it and use it at least twice a day."
3,"Good, but not powerfull enough",Product arrived very quickly. Every thing is working good. My only gripe is the unit has less power. If you want to fill the tank you have first remove the handle from the unit and put is aside. I have to use it will max speed/force setting for it to work normally for me. I used another model of this company before and it was very good. Dial setting at half mark it self used to be good enough. Not any more with this model. Not really met my expectation hence 3 star rating.
2,older model was great. newest is a problem,"long time user of these devices. started with waterpik and switched after a few years due to the 100 decibel noise level of that unit. happy i changed. the interplak was superior. firstly, and this is still true of the new model WJ6R, the the water spray is ideal. the waterpik is too sharp. the interplak is perfect at all the pressure settings.low noise (yeah!).this is where the new model fails:-pressure is too low even at high. new pump motor is weak.-the pump is no longer self priming. if you let the tub empty during use (easy to do), one must refill and suck the sprayer to get the flow again.-the new unit is so light that if your sink is wet the poor little machine vibrates around the sink top.guess i'll look for a new brand"
2,water pik fan,I am not as happy with the Interplak Dental Water Jet as I was with my waterpik. The water jet is not as powerful as the waterpik's. I use it but I am not too satisfied.
4,Great so far,"I bought this in November, 2010, as my third oral irrigator purchase, having killed two more expensive Water Piks after 6 months use each. This one is still going, no problems, used twice per day for fourteen months. It came with a two year warranty which is why the phrase ""so far"" appears in the title of the review. It has a bunch of settings but I just use full blast, 6 I think, and it came with many appliances but I use only the one little bent squirter. My dental hygienist (not an entirely un-foxy lady) brags on my teeth and my home hygiene, so there's something. I notice that the price advantage over Water Pik is not as much as it was at the time of my purchase, but I have no reason to doubt that the quality advantage remains. It's a good product. Buy it."
1,Interplak Dental Water Jet,"I was very disappointed with this product. It has a weak spray, making it insuffient to really clean your teeth and gums. Also the reservoir does not hold enough water. I would NOT recommend buying this product."
1,Interplat Dental Water Jet,"Cheaply made, On and off switch hard to turn on. Don't waste your money on this product."
4,Economical and Efficient,"This is the third one I have owned. The others lasted around 4-5 years each, which is pretty good considering the number of times a day I use it, and that I always have an approximately 10% solution of water and antiseptic (Listerine type) mouth wash solution in it. I clean it from time to time but it is used.. a lot. I owned the water pic brand first (way back 30+yrs ago). The first one was great, but every one after that (I had bought 2 more) crapped out within a few months. That was when I found the Interplak. This one is not as noisy as the others, and it seems to use a bit more water (I run full pressure), But I love it. I hope it lasts the 4-5 yrs the others did and I will be completely satisfied."
4,Great suspense,"The play was totally realistic, so much so that it creeped me out. But I hate cliffhanger endings so that's why I only gave it 4 stars. This is my first time rading gilman but won't be my last!"
4,Works great!,"I tried this for the first time and it works great. The Menthol really seems to feel, smell and work better than the original formula. Even though it clearly states the size, I was expecting the bottle to be a bit bigger. I'll definitely be buying this again, along theNeutrogena T-Gel Treatment Conditioner, 4.4 Fluid Ounce. I've noticed less itch and I was using the regular T-Gel formula previously."
3,Bought this along with Scalpicin products,"I bought this along with Scalpicin products in my second attempt to cure my scalp itchiness. I still use this product regularly, even though my itchiness is almost gone. I am giving three stars because I am not sure if this product alleviated my itchiness. If you are interested in what I said about the Scalpicin products I used, please read my review on Scalpicin Maximum Strength Liquid Scalp Itch Treatment."
1,"Wasted 1972 using ""Profit Magic""","This is an old book, although you wouldn't know it by the Amazon information here (March 2000? ).I wasted 18 months using it's Fourrier charting stuff in a trading partnership in Houston, in 1972-3.We didn't lose money, but our broker bought a Mercedes and we were stuck with old VWs."
2,Difficult reading,"I bought this book after a highly respected person in the options industry labelled it ""one of the top 3 trading books of all time"" - and I'd read the other two. I've given upon this one on p. 45, although I may pick it up and try again sometime. The content is difficult, but the writing makes it almost impenetrable -- and the charts don't compare with modern ones. So, even though there may well be lessons to learn from it, it requires a dedication of purpose that I just haven't been able to bring to the table."
5,I have hair that gets a lot of ...,"I have hair that gets a lot of tangles and found that I really liked this product. I just spray this on and """"presto"""" my comb just slides through the tangles. It's so easy to use, I've already told many of my friends to try it. It's great."
5,"been there, done that","After receiving the book on my kindle, I realised that I already had a copy of this book in paperback. It was an ineresting story."
4,More of the same but good,"I thought the work was ""good"". Maybe not ""great"", but a strong ""will do"". Ms. Brown has segued into mystery fiction. There is nothing wrong with that. It pays the bills and typically has a rabid fan base. I'm sure she makes a cool mil. or two per book. Eat your hearts out. That being said, I've never seen such ""catty"" (forgive the pun) critics as you. No wonder Anne Rice lashed out at you Amazon folk. I've seen some of the most nasty, vitriolic responses to this book and I would have to say ""shame on you"". Amazon seems to corner the maket on bringing in some of the most ""wanna be"", poisonous, crappy criticisms of ANY book ever. I would imagine that many of you would deem Scarlett O' Hara not ""sympathetic"" enough. Well, fine then. Write your own. Market it (Good friggin' luck) and see how far it gets ya. Best to be kind to those who have gone and done. After all, where are ya now?"
1,Cat's Eye Witness,"What happened??! I have really been enjoying the Sneaky Pie Brown series - up till now. Found this one to be extremely disappointing and far off the mark for all the characters- they weren't very likeable. Conversations were too preachy and had little or nothing to do with the basic story line. There was very little focus leading up to how the mystery was solved, and the condition in which the murder victim(s) were found, more graphic than it needed to be.Ms Brown needs to go back and review her earlier books in this series and refresh her memory on why this series has been so fun to read.Judy"
1,Ignorance shows,Ted Andrews is a far better read on so many levels it is astounding. The falsehoods portrayed by this author are amazing to me. Inaccurate statements abound through out. I am not sure if the author made up things as she went along but if she did use valid sources and resources it certainly does not show.
2,can't review this product,i can't rate this product. it was a gift and i have not heard from the person who received this gift if he likes or dislikesthis product.
2,rip off of the name,For all you folks who just loved the 1st monoploy casino and have seen all the new versions in the casinos in vegas . You would think you couldnt be with out this one well think again .If I could send this one back I would. Where is Party Train or any of the new games? What no games with the famous bonus rounds . Hell the bonus rounds are what make Monoploy slot machines so much fun . If they are here I cant find them.Thought they would fix the interface when playing 1 coin machines you still have to hit bet 1 then spin .All in all fun program but just a ripoff on the name to get folks who love the real machines to spend money. If you dont own the 1st monoploy casnio buy that one and pass on this game
5,Amazing!,This band is one of the newer bands that will keep metal alive. This album is one of the best metal albums to come out in the past 2 years. Do yourself a favor and get a copy!
3,Through the Ages,"From the stone ages to the wild west, the origins of weapons. Cave men used hard stone. Missle weapons have been used since the stone ages. The bronze age came 6000 years ago; they also used iron. Alexander employed the phalanx in Macedonia. The dark ages from the 400s to 900s saw celtic tribesmen. By the 1400s two handed swords were in use. The middle ages saw the crossbow and long bow. Axes, daggers and knives have been used since prehistoric times. Chain mail was used through the 13th century. By the 15th century knights were encased in plate armor. Warriors have used helmets since the bronze age. A look at history through the ages."
4,"4 stars, mainly for the splendid photos","I don't know if this is ""the ultimate look at the legend"", as the book bills itself in its subtitle (particularly as Mr. Haspiel has since written two other books on Marilyn, with equally outstanding photographic content) but it's one of the best picture collections of the star I've ever seen. Haspiel was one of a group of fans who came to know Marilyn personally while she was living in New York during the 1950's, and much of the text consists of his reminiscences of his encounters with her. It's hard to conceive, in these paranoid times, of fans being able to have such unfettered access to a first-rank star, so this book is a reminder of what was, in some ways, a fundamentally more innocent time. I don't know that I agree with Haspiel's theories as to Marilyn's death (I think Donald Spoto's version is much nearer the mark), but as a collector of candid photography of Marilyn, he doesn't have many equals."
1,They changed the formula; now it doesn't work!,"I have used Neutrogena T-Gel Extra strenght shampoo for more than 15 years and have recommended it to other people. I liked it because it had 4% coal tar and no fragrance. It was darker than the regular strength T-Gel. Suddenly, sometime in the last year, the shampoo sold as Extra Strength became lighter and had a fragrance; it also started stinging my eyes. I suspected that they simply started making only one strength and put it in the two different bottles in order to keep from losing the market. I contacted one of their reps who called on my Dermatologist's office to push his products, and he denied that Neutrogena had changed its formula for the Extra Strength.Then I noticed that my scalp psoriasis was getting worse and worse. I have now switched to Psoriatrax 5%. It has only been a week and my scalp is much better.If you have used this and have noticed it is less effective than before, try Psoriatrax."
1,shampoo expires in 05/2013. I'm going to lose one of them,Shampoo expires in 05/2013. I'm going to lose one of them. Is a bad deal but the shampoo is good
2,Smells Awful...Does it work?,"I just started using this this morning, so I can't comment on it's effectiveness just yet, however, the smell alone is just disgusting. I smell like a railroad tie. I thought it would rinse out, but it hasn't and I'm sitting at work hoping no one approaches me. My co-workers are going to wonder who's paving a driveway. I'm going to stick with this for a week, if I can handle the smell. I don't feel any relief, even though the claim on the box says you will get relief even after one treatment. More to come..."
2,"Didn't help my dandruff, itchy scalp or hair loss.","I'm not one to write reviews (especially negative ones), but I must be honest in saying that I was unpleasantly surprised at the results of using this T-Gel shampoo for one week. I've got an extremely itchy, dry, and flaky scalp caused from a combination of the dry/cold air and excess hair product. Based on the reviews, I was super excited to purchase this shampoo to cure the annoying side effects that my dry scalp has caused.Needless to say, after one week of use, I've noticed NO improvement in the health of my hair/scalp and the annoying side effects continue to occur. Additionally, I have to comment on the smell; it's terrible! It reminds me of moth balls from my grandmothers attic. Worst of all, there's a note on the box that says ""New Clean Scent"". If clean smells like moth balls, then I want to be dirty!I'll continue using it for another few days in a las ditch effort, but I'm not convinced. Will update if results change!"
4,Two Worlds....,"I won't go too far into the the story as anyone reading this is probably already a big fan of Voltron and knows the story. This short movie involves the traditional lion team Voltron meeting up with the Voltron made of, basically, cars and helicopters and battling against a horde of monsters...and even an evil Voltron-type monster. The picture quality is much what one would expect from a 30 year old tv special. The audio is just alright. Nothing amazing. Certainly not up to the standards of the incredible tin cased sets of the tv series. All in all, you definately need to get this to complete your Voltron collection."
5,AWESOME,Got this poster for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas and she freaked! It is huge with lots of bright colors. Perfect for a tween room!
