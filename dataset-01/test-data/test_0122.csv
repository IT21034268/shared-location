3,Know Your Enemy,"Know Your Enemy is a an album that mixes all kinds of genres and the end result is that one ends up listening to a very strange album. Some songs sound like it could be inspired by the Beach Boys, whilst others sound like the rough rock music from their formative days as a group. We also get a disco song on this very eclective album. The song ""Let Robeson Sing"" is a shameless propaganda song that sounds like a failed highschool project with trite lyrics. I agree with Allmusic but I think 3 stars is a more fair assessment then to give it 2 stars. All the lyrics are included and we do get a list of whom plays what on the album. 3/5."
1,"this is the most pointless, stupid movie of all time","this movie has no point, it doesnt even deserve 1 sta"
5,Get half baked. Then get half baked.,"Half Baked is the awesomest comedy made. It's my all time favorite movie. If you're ever bored on a Friday night, get this movie. If you like hippies, watch it."
5,I Loved Half Baked!,"Ok I just hafta say after watching Half Baked 6 times its still the best! Like i said i loved the movie! My favorite charicter has to be Scarface! I like the part at Killers funrial (killer is the dog scarface got) when Brian says a story about Killer! and i like when scarface gose up to the guy on the couch (thats his name too!) saying did u kill my dog yo? he says no, then scarface says: I dont know why but i belive him! Well thats all im saying cuse you should see the movie and i bet u will laugh so hard u start crying! Hope you enjoy the movie has much as me!"
4,Not Much Taught Put Into It,But on the other side it is a good DVD for a boring day to brighten it up.
4,wesley pipes or billy bong,"I had to much fun with this one, boy let me tell you but its a classic stoners comedy and its way better then some of the stoner movies coming out this year. classic moments include where Harland Williams asks the dudes to see what they want to munch on and Jim Breuer is adding a bunch of crap to the list. where Williams feeds all the munchies to the horse. Jim Breuer falling out of the sky. theres a lot more but anyway, Breuer is the scene chewer in this one and he plays a stoner well"
5,This movie has it all.,"For those who have seen the movie Half Baked know what i'm talkin about. For those who havnt should read my review. I thought Half Baked had it all, comedy, action and drama. It is a good movie to watch with a group of friends. For a good time rent Half Baked at your local video store. END"
5,Truly an excellent book!,"THis is a must have for young children. There is no text and only one number on each page. However, this book is a delight.On page one exactly one of everything appears, on page two you two of more things and on page ten you see ten of many things. As the numbers grow higher the little town grows and the seasons change. THis enables you to discuss counting with your child as well as tell a story about the little town. You can also talk about seasons. What a wonderful multi use book. The illustrations are gentle and are not garish.This is truly an excellent book. Well worth the money."
5,Wonderful book,"I have bought numerous copies of this book to give to the children of relatives and friends. I got my first copy of it when my son (now 27) was small, and he loved it. I have one copy that I keep at home for myself, though I have no grandchildren yet--the pictures are so lovely, simple, and comforting, and I usually have one or two more books in stock to give as gifts. Everyone I have given a book to loves it as well. I like all of the other Anno books that I have seen, but I think this is the best."
1,"Great product, BUT L'Oreal tests on animals unnecessarily","L'Oreal produces great makeup products, no doubt about it - but they also test on animals, and completely needlessly to boot (most makeup manufacturers no longer test on animals and the EU actually has a phase out plan in place to eliminate most animal testing across the board in a few years). So I prefer to spend my money elsewhere - Mary Kay is fantastic and so is ZUZU Luxe, among many others."
4,Cd kicks ass!,"If Chris got an injury that made it so he couldnt wrestle, music is definatly where he belongs! Basically all fozzy does is take the 80's sound and re-vamp it and make it sound a little more modern. If your into the 80's metal then you could relate to this album. A definate must for the metal-head"
4,bag - looks good,"My son is really pleased about this bag - looks good though a bit ""loud"".Good service."
4,My favorite poetry,"Having been raised on the Central Coast, Robinson Jeffers Poetry struck a chord. I have long since moved on, but rereading his work nourishes my soul . I return many times each year to walk the rugged coastline and and remember. I gave this book only four stars. I was disappointed. I gave it as a gift to a grandchild - and it is too much. I should have paid more attention and chosen a smaller volume that focused on the area I love. Too much R. Jeffers for the first time reader."
5,I had no idea,"Wow, I don't even know where to start with this book. I was very skeptical picking up a book about whales. But...I shouln't have been. It tells a story about animals that I would never otherwise consider. Ever. Before, when I thought about killer whales I thought ""Seaworld."" and ""Shamu."" Now the thought of orcas makes me shudder. Before, when I thought about a large whale, it was almost like thinking about an inanimate object...or maybe a goldfish. In my mind, they didn't do anything but flop on the water every so often in different places up north. Now...I think of whales as beings with fears and happiness, as facing dangers and obsticles, as doing specific things and having lives. This book portrays whales as having emotions, thoughts and ideas, as having exhaustive memories and family ties. It also gives us a glimpse into the lives of other creatures like dolphins.It's a story, told well, that you may at first scoff at but will come away feeling schooled."
2,I lost interest waiting for something to happen,"The book is extremely well researched and teaches the reader a lot about undersea mammals like whales, orcas and dolphins.Unfortunately the minutae of the main characters' pursuit of each other left me gasping about one-fifth of the way in and I put the book down.I was hoping for a whale's-eye view of the end of the world and I got an overly-detailed view of whale behavior instead.Sort of like if a Dean Koontz quest novel consisted largely of descriptions of how the car operated, whether the protagonists stayed at Days Inns or Motel 6's each night and the debates over choosing between McDonald's and Burger King. Every day.I kinda forgot where the book was going.The fact that this book has attracted only three reviews so far may be an indication of how many readers actually finished it.Good reviews from the trade notwithstanding, no matter how well-designed a car is, if it doesn't go anywhere it's just a big paperweight."
1,"All the cheap b-rated, low budget horror films all in 1!!!!!","I must say the only film worth watching in this entire set is The Horror of Dracula. All the rest suck. Dont waste your money on this peace of crap, just buy the Horror of Dracula seperatley."
5,Great coin purse,I have been looking foir this purse. Finally found it on Amazon. Just what I wanted and the service was excellent.
3,Beautiful and delicate,"I purchased this for my girlfriend for valentines day last year. She wore it everday there after. Unfortunately the chain supplied with the pendant is very thin and has broken twice. the first time we were able to get it repaired, the second we decided to purchase a new chain. Diamonds seem to be good quality and look very beautiful. Good Product just have to be careful with the chain."
2,disappointing,"Unfortunately, while the shape and function are fine, the container is not sealed well. Bottom is molded and cracks and it is multiple plastic pieces. All of this leaves gaps for ants to get at food. If ants or freshness are not issues for you, then it should be fine. But I expected at least a good seal from a rubbermaid product."
1,"You're kidding, right?","A Star Wars medical novel? Wookie General Hospital? Jedi E.R.? It seems that genre mixing has gone too far at last, and that's from someone who loves Star Wars tremendously... Please George, let's get back to what made Star Wars great in the first place..."
3,"Nice product, but.....","Nice product, but did not come with any type of instructions or information on a warranty. I did however receive some cool Hurst stickers....lol."
1,Title Misleading,"This book seems like a good book for a Wiccan to read, but when I read it I discovered that all it is is a thorough set of ""letters"" concerning the sabbats. No correspondances, no instruction, just a detailed description of Rae's day to day life. Good for one who would benifit from this kind of stuff, but not for most."
2,Extremely dry and lacking information.,"I dislike writing negative reviews, but I see it as a duty to caution people that come after me.This is NOT a handbook on how to practise Wicca. This book contains letters she wrote to two students.This book is extremely skimpy in information one can actualy use.I would recommend that you ignore this book and look at ""Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner"" by Scott Cunningham instead.I am not Wiccan. I am a Shaman, but Wicca is one of the many faiths I explored.If you have questions or comments; E-Mail me. Two BearsWah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
1,A call to remember,"I want so see a trailer of this film,in Austria,i cant see,or buy it ,when did it start on TV-in Austria,or cable-TV-in Germany,via sattelit! Please remind me as soon as posible !"
1,Amazon won't make it right....atleast for now....,"I bought this item before they updated the description. IT DOES NOT work with the silver and green Leapster out on the market. I informed Amazon of this, I was very angry, to learn this on Christmas morning, the responded by sending me another exact charger. Well that didn't help. When I questioned them again they basically told me tough luck but that I could return the item for a refund. I BETTER NOT be paying return shipping on either of the rechargers, and I want free shipping when I buy the correct charger. I called LeapFrog today. The L-Max charger works with the new Leapster. Wishing I had never ordered from Amazon, since they aren't willing to make the situation right and their customer service is impossible! Good luck!"
1,Leapster recharging system,The batteries wonèt last. Such a waste I bought it just for the leapster. The one for L-max is still working though!
5,MUST HAVE,Unless you own stock in energizer you MUST buy this accessory. It should come with the leap pad but its worth the $25. You will go through that many batteries within a few months. Its easy to use and works great.
1,Brake Dust and Noise,"These pads are designed to be low dust, I find that incorrect.Lots of noise and dust when braking. I have over 2000 miles and these have made noise and dust since day one.I will be upgrade sooner rather than later due to the poor performance of these pads. These pads do a great job of stopping the car. Just not ideal with dust and noise."
4,A delightful read,"What a surprisingly insightful read! This book gives an all rounded view of our vocation, our design & our purpose. Not many are engaged in full time ministry & it's certainly comforting & encouraging to know that even for those of us who don't, God has not forgotten us! God cares about our ""secular"" work too. Bring God to your workplace and find new meaning to your work & ministry."
1,Not What I Needed!,"I ordered this book thinking it would help me to clarify job decisions and what I found instead was an irritatingly religious, moralizing, Christian work on finding your ""mission""/ job. That is fine if that is what you are looking for; otherwise stay far away."
5,Cavalleria with Del Monaco,"This is a rare recording with one of the greatest (if not the greatest) tenor of the last two centuries--Mario Del Monaco. With a voice more masculine than the great Luciano Pavarotti and more versatile than the phenomenal Franco Correlli, this is ""ear candy"" for any and all opera fanatics and refined music lovers."
4,"Under-rated, entertaining and the best Carpenter for years.","Whilst not as good as the book it's based on this film is good on it's own merits. Excellent Woods' performance and decent pacing make it a great Saturday night rental / purchase. Excellent Carpenter commentary track too. Great action scenes and decent change from all the smug Scream teen horror films of the last few years. Any more of that style and the horror film genre is finished. To sum up, decent, fun film that deosn't outstay it's welcome. Buy it."
3,Good movie... except for the ending.,"John Carpenter delivers a good action/horror film that, while not scary, is intense and exciting. It is not as dark as some of his other works and as such may appeal to a much broader audience. Carpenter fans raised on the pessimistic tone of such works as THE THING, IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, and PRINCE OF DARKNESS may come away disappointed. Don't let that deter you. There is much to like in this film. The performances, particularly James Woods and Thomas Ian Griffith, are good. The score, as usual, is excellent. The film looks good and is very stylish, helping move the story along briskly. The only complaint that I have is the cop-out happy ending. It just doesn't feel right, perhaps owing more to audience expectations than to the dictates of the story. It seriously hampers the film, causing it to slip a notch or two. That said, see this film. It is good, if not great, Carpenter."
4,Cool and Different Vampire movie,"Being a fan of John Carpenter's work, I eagerly awaited this film to appear on DVD, and I'm now happy. The transfer of the picture was fine and crisp, and the 5.1 channel audio was excellent. Plus it's a great movie too."
4,Kick A$$ effects and great story,"This movie got bad reviews but I loved it. It had a cool story line and cool effects like when the one slayer is ripped in half and a priest's brains get blown out of the back of his head onto the ceiling showing just how brutal this master of all vampires is. I'd watch it again. The lesser vampires were too lame in comparison to the main master. If you like vampire movies, go for it."
3,"Humor, gore and fright","This movie has humor, gore and some scary scenes. As a horror movie it is a little lame, but as a vampire movie it is a nice change in plot."
5,Serious Blood Sport,This movie is so cooooool....lots of blood lots of violence lots of sharp teeth and lots of nice women.The story revolves around two Vampire Hunters and their quest to destroy the ultimate vampire the action scenes are incredible and who doesen't like to see a vampire burn.
1,A definite bomb. Only James Woods is worthy of praise.,"An utter disappointment. A bomb. There's no other way to describe John Carpenter's Vampires. Carpenter isn't one of my favorite directors but I've before Vampires, I've seen five of his films and I enjoyed three of them. Halloween was a creepy slasher flick that took more scares from implicit violence, The Thing was a creative special effects sci-fi thriller, They Live was a paranoid action thriller, and Big Trouble in Little China was a hilarious action-comedy.Watching Vampires, I was hoping for the scares of Halloween, the edge of your seat suspense from The Thing, and the action of Big Trouble in Little China. Instead, Vampires exceeded in explicit violence and gore, had little action and the suspense was nonexistent. The only thing noteworthy of this film is James Woods, who delivers an over-the-top performance as vampire slayer Jack Crow."
1,"LOVE CARPENTER, HATE THIS MOVIE","VAMPIRES is one of the worst films of the year. See the DVD ONLY if you are a Carpenter fan so you can listen to the director's commentary, but other than that stay far, far away. James Woods and Daniel Baldwin are awful. Waste of money and time."
2,"Fun beginning and end, but everything else drags.","The title says it all: James Woods is a vampire slayer out to get the bloodsuckers that killed his teammates. John Carpenter's attempt at the vampire subgenre is mostly middling, with a great beginning (we get not one, but TWO gory massacres!) and an almost-as-energetic finale (which is marred a bit by a final showdown that's waaayyy too short). Unfortunately, the material in-between is horrendously paced and very dull, most of the characters are blase and unsympathetic, and there's a psychic link subplot thrown in the mix. Carpenter displays a solid hand at action and James Woods and Tim Guinee deliver memorable performances, but it never goes the extra step the set-up seemed to promise...** 1/2 out of *****"
2,"Saw it once, Haven't watched it since.","I saw this movie in the theater, and thought it was great, but when I bought it on DVD, I just could not bear watching it again.If yo uhaven't seen this movie, rent it, or better yet borrow it, but don't buy it."
4,James Woods over the top. What a surprise!,"Listening to the director's commentary on this DVD was quite insightful, because you see how much leeway director John Carpenter gave actor James Woods. A lot Woods' improvisation got into the final cut of the film, which is okay because once you get into the film he's just about the only good guy left. The film begins with a neat idea: a paramilitary group of vampire hunters with their well honed techniques of taking out the vamps. Add to this the nice twist of a Master Vampire and his cadre of cohorts. The problem is the rest of Woods' group gets wiped out early on, just when I was thinking that it would be neat to have a Vampire version of Aliens. This is not a subtle ride, but a fine B-flick worthy of a bucket of popcorn with added butter."
4,BLOODY HELL,"TO start with you need to watch this film with an open mind, you cannot watch THE THING and then watch VAMPIRES and expect to see the same special effects and quality acting (Kurt Russell) RIP, well escape from LA was a bit cack. Good film, good DVD so why not buy it, go on especialy if you've still got a bit of fright left in you from halloween (NOT H20)."
2,Vampire Bites the Dust,"This wasn't as bad as expected in the begining and I gave it a chance but somewhere around half way, the film becomes another routine teen action flick with nothing to say. Woods isnt awful as the aging vampire hunter who cuts the fingers of priests to extract information but the vampire is so lame that we don't even think its frightening anymore. Most of the vampires look like rejects from a 1980's gothic bar and they are about as scary as a dead mosquito. The early 80's vampire flicks (Fright Night, Vamp, Dracula) are much better and I'd recommend seeing those instead of this waste."
2,If I Were A Carpenter,"...named John, I'd go back and ask Hollywood to give him less money so he can make classics like ""Halloween."" ""Vampires"" opens with a wonderful action sequence where the ""batbusters"" raid a nest of ""goons,"" their terminology for vampires. After that, it's downhill. Although the tongue is definitely in the cheek, it gets caught on several occasions. Some of the lighting and camera work are truly inspired, but the acting is mediocre, and even the inimitable James Woods cannot save his character. The ""surprise"" with Maximilian Schell as the Cardinal is also pretty farfetched. The lovely Sheryl Lee did a much better job wrapped in a plastic bag on ""Twin Peaks"" and as for Daniel Baldwin, well, he certainly looks like his brother Alec...that's where any comparison ends.There are so many plot holes and unanswered questions, you'd think John Carpenter directed by proxy.Disappointing...watch ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing"" for true Carpenter magic!"
5,"nice lipstick, great price","my mother in law was looking for this color and was so glad to find it and loved the price, too"
4,A Great Album From One of Long Islands Hottest Ska Bands,"From the high-energy opening of Fuzzy to the sweet, ska-flavored cover of You Belong To Me, Spider Nick and the Maddogs' second album contains a great mix of songs that shows what makes these guys so much fun to see in concert.Some of the best tracks on this album show the many styles these guys tackle including straightforward ska (Uncle Al and As Good As You), calypso (Angelina), and good ol' Rock n' Roll (Midnight Special). Other highlights include One Cup of Coffee and Return to Kali, a reprise of the title track from their first album.This album is a lot of fun and is definitely worth checking out. They also put on a mean concert!"
4,Very good and practical organizer,"The CLIE works great but the software for Sync misses some items at times. Apart from the software, it's a very handy compact and easy to use organizer"
2,Nice unit but poor battery,"I picked this unit up for my son 2 years ago, he enjoyed it a great deal, until the battery would no longer hold a charge. That happened about a year after he got it. I was just looking into getting a new battery for it so he could use it again and went to a battery store. They checked and an aftermarket replacement cost $49+ plus $5 S&H so I'm still in search mode on that."
1,Mascara that looks expired and beat up,I just received my mascara in the mail today and it looks like it came from a store that closed and this was the left over product. The packaging was sun faded and beat up. The worse part is that there is gross finger print residue on the front of the package like a little kid with Cheeto covered fingers touched it. I'm not impressed and am quite irritated I wasted $10 on this product.
2,not for me,"I didn't even finish the book. By the end of the first chapter I was disgusted by the completely one-sided portrayal of women, particularly minority women, as abject victims of white men. I agree that this book has its roots in truth, but I think that a more evenly assessed account could certainly have been written.I didn't like the attitude of the author. She seems to think that black women were the only ones who suffered. What about black males? Or white women? Or Native Americans? Just because I didn't see them in the first chapter doesn't mean they aren't discussed at all, but it didn't set the right tone for me."
5,MOST UPLIFTING AND SOUL REVIVING BOOK I'VE READ!,"This is book penned with much love and understanding. In the trying times that we live in, we need a book like The Ink of Heaven to remind us that we can overcome and succeed in life. Going through a hard time myself, I've read this book several times! Everytime I feel like life is getting me down or I need some encouragement, I pick up The Ink of Heaven. When I get done reading a passage I feel much better! Char B. Branch.....keep on penning for God! We are ALL Listening! If you haven't read the book, I encourage you to get one! Pick up an extra copy, it will make an AWSOME gift for a close friend in need of some guidance! Have a blessed day!"
4,Paul Samson - 'P. S.... 1953-2002' (Angel Air),"Good CD release from the folks at Angel Air a few years after Samson's death. I have to give this title a four-star rating simply because it rocked, more so than I had expected. Above average British metal, to say the least. Most favored tracks are the awesome ""Brand New Day"", ""Mean Woman"", ""Broken Heart"" {good vocals}, ""When Tomorrow Comes"", ""Getting Ready"" and ""Shooting For The Moon"". Line-up: Paul Samson (R.I.P. you will be missed, my friend}-guitar&keyboards, Ian Ellis-bass, John McCoy-rhythm guitar, Nicky Moore-vocals and Billy Fleming-drums. Good chance this title will appeal to fans of Diamond Head, Saxon, Vardis and possibly Iron Maiden. A should-have."
5,This show ruled!!!,This show is so awsome. I have been trying to remember what this show was called for so long. Me and my sister used to watch this show all the time and now i realize that it is a remake. This show is so hokey and corny that it's awsome. If you like T.V. shows from the early 90s then you should definitly buy this. You won't be disappointed.
2,Not what i expected,"All i have to say is was very disappointed when listening to this cd, i was anticipating some funky high up tempo beats from his past album essential mix but when listening to this it was simply garbage. Too much vocals in this cd, definetly not the way icey djs at the club. I don't know what he was thinking releasing these ... tracks but this cd does no justice to seeing icey live or his past cds. All i can say is save your money"
2,THEY TRICKED US HARDCORE VAMPIRE FANS,"First of all, if these were to have been new movies. It would of been cool. Just so you don't get tricked, if you don't know, these movies (except the one with the actress (duff, a prior full moon actress) were just exerpts from the subscies movies and vampire journals, which was also a full moon production. So, with anticipation I purchased it, and I was totally let down by it. But, if you don't have the full moon compilacion of subspecies and the other story where (Duff, produced and co wrote) its a fair triology to watch. The advantage of having the full series of subspecies, is that it tells the whole story. As well as the other one in it. These are literally watered down short versions....."
2,not bad for amateurs,"This is early residents, when they could barely play instruments. It is an interesting sound collage , taking inane pop songs and twisting them beyond recognition(almost). Essential listening for residents fans but not for anyone else. Thank you"
1,Save your money,"I am a huge fan of the Residents (UWEB #0159). They have been absolutely brilliant throughout so much of their career. This, however, is the biggest piece of turd they ever laid. Even the attempt at humor is lost in what may be one of the worst recordings ever by anyone. Unfortunately, I can't give it Zero stars. A cringeworthy cacophony of chaos. Save your money and buy Mark of the Mole."
5,Beautiful People,We are so much more than what can be seen......Very beautiful music for meditation. The person who cuts my hair plays this CD and it helps me see myself in a different way....Bought this second hand through Amazon and was pleased with it.
2,My First and Last Elizabeth Berg Novel - Read Why,"This novel confused me. (I would give it 1-1/2 stars if possible.) The subject matter is decidedly adult (divorce affairs, near affairs), but the writing seems more appropriate for someone in the age range of maybe an 11 to 14 year old girl. In fact, I even looked it up to see if I accidentally selected a book meant for young readers. Both the husband and the wife are so incredibly childish acting, the story seemed infantile and unrealistic. All the scenes with the husband playing a shopping mall Santa were unnecessary and, frankly, rather stupid. I love quirky characters, but these characters were just kind of foolish. The only person halfway plausible and interesting was the young daughter. After this taste of Berg's writing, I will not sample another."
1,Pathetic all the way through,I am firmly with the one star raters on this one. Unmoving characters and no apparent story line. I read (actually listen) to books for entertainment as I spend a lot of time commuting to work in the car. Elizabeth Berg has done much better in my opinion. I will not give up on her books but I wish I had passed on this one. I kept waiting for something to happen. It was mercifully short and David Colacci delivered a great job of reading the audio book so I did make it to the end. Let's hope for better efforts in the future.
4,FUNNY,I tried this stuff on my friend and made hime burp. Then I tried it on my brother and he started burping and farting out of control. It was soooo funny. It also makes your mouth smell like licorice. this product is cool and you never know if it is going to be a burp a fart or both! You should get it and use it!! It's really fun!
4,Impressive! Feels like Gossip Girl the Movie.,"I didn't expect much from this film. I just picked it out of curiosity, and to my surprise, I enjoyed this movie. It was better than I thought. I felt watching a movie version of Gossip Girl. I am always fascinated by high society, and with all that power, how it can affect one's life.The movie does have subtle message, but for me, it was jut about learning the art of seduction. :)Pretty cool."
2,Cruel Liaison,"This movie is modernized, teenage-ized, Americanized version of the great movie, ""Dangerous Liaison"", only with lesser actors and actresses. It was funny that Phillippe sometimes immitates Malchovich's speaking. Overall, the quality of this movie really can't match that of Dangerous Liaison. For the people who haven't seen DL, this movie could be still enjoyable (thus 2 stars). For the people who already watched DL, save your money."
5,Fantastic for all ages,"I think many people would write this off as another teen flick in the midst of lots of mediocre ones. But Cruel Intentions is so wonderful; it is sexy, romantic, smart, and sassy. It may not be realistic, but it is a masterful teenaged interpretation of Les Liasons Dangereux. This movie really touched me, and I think it was well done and very entertaining."
5,Cruel Intentions is great!,"This movie is my favorite movie ever. It's so great and Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe play excellent roles not to mention Reese Witherspoon, my favorite actress, who plays an innocent virgin in the movie. It's a wonderful movie for everyone (unless you're offended by sexuality) but the plot is awesome, Katherine (Gellar), Phillippe's step sister plays an exciting role in seuducing Sebastian (Phillippe). This is a must see and you're going to love it! I guarantee it!"
5,My favorite movie!,"I own this movie on VHS and when my mom asked to watch it, I kindly told her it wasn't a movie she'd probably want to see. Full of lies, deception and most of all, seduction, Cruel Intentions is a story crafted around Sebastian Valmont and his stepsister Kathryn's plan to devirginize the new stepmaster's daughter and corrupt an innocent new student who is unknowingly stealing Kathryn's ex-boyfriend. Although it's commonly labeled a drama, there are comedic elements thrown in and with all the beautiful actors and actresses in it, how could you not want to watch this?"
5,Cruel (sexy) Intensions,"What more can be said about this movie? The sound track is great, Sarah and Ryan, Reese and Selma all fit into the film perfectly. The rather twisted story about a step brother and sister's sexual deviations just adds more flavor to an otherwise excellent movie. Ryan and Sarah interact pretty well. And who can forget Selma Blair and Sarah Michelle Gellar's smooching in Central Park. (Which won an award for best kiss of 1999)If you're into twisted, modern young and filthy rich movies (The In crowd is good too) this is one to get. If you are a Sarah Michelle Gellar fan you get to see some of her best acting ever in this film (as well as her real hair color.)"
4,CRUEL SIMPLY RULES,"Over here in England Cruel Intentions is only a 15,which makes it highly popular and appealing to it's age group. The movie is great,the only problem is the slow beginning which actually derivates the films average slightly . Still the film is HOT and saucy. The plot is interesting with a mega twist towards the end that will make your stomach churn. Gellar and Witherspoon's performances are excellent and Ryan Philippe does well considering that he has been voted for one of the worst performances in movie 54. Cruel Intentions is a very different type of teen flick,nasty and raw to the bone.With a script that you could never imagine repeating to your average British boyfriend! The film is doing well in England at the mo' And let's face it,cruel definitely rules!"
3,I liked it...a couple of times.....it gets boring easily,"The best part of this movie? The opening song. The plot? Pretty good. And trust me, this movie was WAY better than it was supposed to be! If you have ever checked out the original plot....let's just say we all would have hated it. The acting... i would have expected MUCH BETTER from Gellar, but this is really what Phillipe's acting is all about. This is probably one of his better acting pieces. He does pretty good with his charecter. As for Miss Witherspoon, i think she could have done SO much better. Or maybe that it was just that the charecter of Annette that she played was so boring and bland. On a whole, i liked this movie, especally the ending. But if you compare this to it's original, Dangerous Liaisons, i'd chose the latter"
4,Guilty Pleasure,"Despite the unnecessary sexual parts between Sebastian and Kathryn, Cruel Intentions is a very good movie. It's a great story on how a player turns good and falls in love. The ending is way to sad for my taste but it was still good. It would have been funny to see his death be a joke to his sister Kathryn. There were a lot of funny parts in the movie, my favorite being the one at the retirement home with Sebastian talking to Mrs. Sugarman. It's really funny and really shows his personality. I loved how they introduced Sebastian. At first you think he's a bad guy turned good at therapy and then it shows you how cocky he is. Reese Witherspoon was really good as the ""good girl"" in this movie. The character of Cecille has no point in the movie in my opinion except to make it funny when Sebastian pushes her off the bed. It's a really romantic movie at the end but the sex scene between Sebastian and Annette was a little long in my opinion...we got the point."
1,"So much for the ""R"" rating","This is appalling. Most of the high ratings for this movie are apparently from people not old enough to watch it without Mom and Dad along. I guess if you want your kids to become mindless, superficial, spoiled, trashy people like the characters in this flick, go right ahead."
1,OBVIOUS INTENTIONS...,What I want to know is where were all the mature adults when all this machiavellian chicanery was going on...It reminded me of 'Lord of the Flies' another survival-of-the=fittest story about even younger kids in another kind of jungle.Except they took no prisoners.Lord spare me from teenagers like these.
1,Only Good if You Suffer From Insomnia,Stay away unless you like your movies boring. This waste of celluloid plods along without ever really displaying any of the passion that is promised in its previews/trailers. Recommended only for those who have trouble sleeping at night.
3,Acting...?,The story's great. There's no doubt about that. But the acting is just awkward. Its like these people took acting lessons from post-Twilight Kristen Stewart. Grrrr.
5,This is is fantasctic,I saw it three times (!) and it looks better everytime. Ryan Phillype is great and smg is incredible. Everything is good in it. I am sad there is no deleted scenes on the DVD.
5,Sarah Michelle Gellar at Her Best,"I'm going to make this short and to the point. ""Cruel Intentions"" is a great movie. The performances, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Philippe, Reese Witherspoon, Selma Blair, Joshua Jackson, as well as Christin Baranski and Swoosie Kurtz, are all great and fun to watch. If you liked ""Dangerous Liasons"" you'll love this hip remake as well."
1,Horrible movie,"I'm baffled why anyone, save the most mentally impaired, would choose to watch this movie when the far superior (in every conceivable way) ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is available. The actors are pretty to look at but their acting is so poor (especially from the unforgivable Ryan Phillpe), one is forced to ask the eternal question, ""Why?!"""
3,"Cruel intentions, kind review","Cruel intentions is one of those movies that would appeal to the yonger generation. however the story isnt just about a sex scandal. it has a strange way of showing it but its based around love. Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a bet with her step brother(Phillipie) that if he can manage to lose Resse Witherspoons virginity. She would make love to him. The story is good and the confrantations of Sex, lies, Betrayal all come into this rather average film. Some people see this as a sex flick but that would only really be from the mouths of 10-16 year olds. Good to watch at least once but after that its not worth seeing again. Buy it if you have to but make your own decision if you have seen it"
5,"It was awesome,Ryan Phillippe is soooo hot.","This movie had everything in it a little bit of laughs a bit of action, but mostly it was about a playa' named sebastion (Ryan Phillippe) that soon relizes that he is in love with this girl(Reese Wetherspoon). He has also made a bet with his step sister(Sara Michelle Geller)that he cn sleep with her be for school starts. While he is trying to get this girl to fall in love with him so she will have sex with him he falls in love with her. Its just a great love story with some drama, comedy, and action on the side. you should really buy this movie when it comes out or rent it"
5,Wonderful Movie,"I went to this movie expecting a pretty good movie with my favorite actress, Sarah Michelle Gellar in it. Instead I was blown away by one of the best movies I have ever seen. All of the actors turned in fantastic performances and the plot twist at the end was so very sad and emotional. Definately a movie worth owning and watching again and again for years to come."
4,Delightfully Evil!!!,"...P>""Cruel Intentions"" revolves around the lives to of a step brother and sister, Katherine and Sebatian (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe), who revel in the cruelty of messing up people's lives. The boredom of their high society lifestyle causes them to play with the minds and hearts of innocent people they claim to like. Everything falls apart when Sebatian actually falls in love with one of his conquests.This story is full of sex, betrayal, love, and deceit. It is one that you will be captivated by instantly. The film is also supported by an incredible soundtrack that goes along perfectly with the many moods and emotions exhibited in it. The ending will also have you laughing to yourself as one of the conspirators gets their comeuppance.I would highly suggest watching this movie! You won't be disappointed!!!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"This toy does not even come assembled, which is beyond ludicrous. I simply tossed mine into the trash, furious and disappointed."
5,A simply amazing album.,"Enough said really...give this album a few listens through and you'll appreciate it's brilliance. With tracks like Any Day Now, Red, and Powder Blue, this album truly stands out. Not really comparable to anyone...but if I had to I'd say they were a mix of Coldplay, Radiohead, Doves and Richard Ashcroft. A must listen to album."
1,this cd is terrible,you have to be a seriously warped elbow junkie to like this misconstrued nonsense. this band could have done so much better.
4,"The deafer you are, the funnier it gets","Some people don't believe in mondegreens because (1.) they have exceedingly good hearing, and (2.) they've failed to notice that other people hear a higher ratio of noise to signal than they do. Being the unobservant gits that they are, they assume that Gavin Edwards must have made up the misheard lines collected in this book. Edwards didn't. His mondegreens are real. It's why they're so funny."
4,"Overall, it's a good product. It's very soft ...","Overall, it's a good product. It's very soft and easy to apply. Also easy to wash off. I'd recommend it to my friends and family to try."
2,If you're on the go and don't have ...,"If you're on the go and don't have time to touch your makeup up, then L'Oreal Perfectly Soft Liner is for you. It stays on for hours! It didn't make my lips look dried out either, like some liners do!"
1,TRICKED!,"I ordered this last December 25, 2012 for my mom who lost the same unit when she went to Singapore. This was delivered last Dec 28 and I promptly shipped this to her in the Philiippines without checking the unit. I only found out that I was given a OneTouch Ultra2 which is cheaper and the only reason I found out is the lancet was missing! It was my fault that I did not check it but I think the vendor is more at fault. They replaced this with a much cheaper unit. Now my mom cannot even use it because the lancet she has is the ultra soft which is not compatible with this unit and the set that should have been included was missing. Never again will I buy from this vendor. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,Excellent for cuts,"This is my ""go to"" for kitchen knife cuts and wounds. I cut my finger. I pour the powder on top. I go on with what I'm doing. I remember my mom slicing her hand open with a cleaver and she just poured on the powder. Feral cat attacks? Pour on the powder. Infection on cat from post-surgery stitches? Pour on the powder. Yes, it's safe for animals. You don't even need a bandaid, the consistency of the powder is sufficient. But do keep your treated wound away from water, or stick a bandaid on top if you know you're going to get wet. For deeper, hospital-necessary wounds, I agree with the other review. Pour on the powder on the way to stem the blood flow until you can get there and the doctor takes over. Yunnan Baiyao's disinfecting properties make it perfect to kill germs and bacteria. The powder form helps to stem blood flow and encourage clotting. One of the best Chinese medicines in my opinion."
2,"Poorly written, low on content","I wish I'd paid more attention to the negative reviews of this book because I am very disappointed in it. To begin with, this book is poorly written (""Like I mentioned earlier..."" for gosh sakes!), poorly edited and full of errors.As for what the book is *not*:- It is not a good introduction to CSS.- It is not a good explanation of why to adopt CSS. (Zeldman's Designing with Web Standards is infinitely better.)- It is not a good resource for best practices and dealing with real-world shortcomings in the implementation of CSS. (Among others, Zeldman is much better on that too.)- It is not a good source of CSS examples. The examples in the book are trivial and pooly explained. There are better examples on lots of free CSS sites and Meyer's Eric Meyer on CSS is a much better book."
3,Falls Short on Practical Examples of CSS,"Designing CSS Web Pages has very good chapters on the planning and structuring of content as well as designing web page layouts using liquid designs and suspension designs. The book falls short in my opinion in the actual examples using CSS. The author doesn't take the time to discuss the how and why of using various CSS rules so that the reader gains a full understanding of the CSS standard and it's use in modern browsers. Many of the examples use pre-written designs that cannot be used outside of the context in which they are used. More discussion of the proper usage of absolute positioning as well as the correct times to use em and px would have been appreciated. Overall this is a good book, but it cannot be considered a bible on the usage of progressive CSS design techniques."
3,My husband was on the Oriskany during the fire.,My husband was on the Oriskany during the fire and took many photo's. One of his photo's were in the book. He was in the photo lab and they had to be evacuated. He said he could not see in front of his face for the smoke. They went out of the photo lab as a group with their hand on the shoulder of the man in front of them. This book told the story. I bought the book for his birthday and it was on his list of birthday gifts. Thanks.
4,Everything in this book is AWESOME!,"The only reason I did not give this book another star is because I still have to ""tweak"" each recipe to make it less caloric.Anything straight from the book tastes wonderful and can be used in any low cal, low fat diet, like Weight Watchers. BUT you can still substitute Splenda, egg beaters, etc. in most of these recipes and make it even healthier.Our family has eaten from this book so often that many of the recipes are memorized, and you can probably follow the book for a good two months without eating the same thing twice.This is the only book we cook from, and I've given several copies away to friends and family who enjoyed a meal. It's great."
4,Great cookbook!,"I really like this cookbook! Directions are easy to follow, dietary breakdown for every recipe is great, no product pushing... Excellent!"
5,At Last Mr.Costner has Proved He Can Star In A Good Movie,"PERFECT - Mr.Costner has finally proved all his critics wrong - He can star and do well in a movie (as long as he does'nt write or produce it).This movie is spellbinding from start to finish - the characters are great , the script is excellent and the multiple plots are genius .Highly Recommended !!"
3,Over rated,"One of the more overrated films to come down the pike recently, this movie features some pretty good acting by Costner and Hurt and comic book acting by most of the rest of the main actors, particularly, ""Mr. Smith"" and Demi. Filming/editing average. Script - ludicrous with silly side threads that didn't add to the main story line. Dialog was pretty decent. Some gratuitous violence that added nothing to the main plot. Entertaining in a ""this is really pretty bad"" kind of way."
2,It could be a good movie,"This could be a good movie, but I think the movie focuses too much on twisted thinking of several psychopats at cost of the story itself. Half of the movie about what the psycho thinks that the FBI agent played by Demi Moore does not have enough time to resolve the main question - who the killer was. The only dicovery she makes is that it is not who she thought. It is one of those movies that you think they finished in the middle. It has some good sceens and I personally liked Demi's performance. The funny thing was how Demi got her first and the only suspect - by pure intuition she was so sure about it. My objection is that the movie is not that much about investigation, but it is about the way the psychos think, this is what the movie promotes."
5,Great,The Mr. Brooks Blu-ray was part of a birthday gift for my son and he was very happy with it. Thank you.
3,Not Bad,"I thought this movie was pretty entertaining. Costner finally finds a good movie to star in. I was skeptical of Dane Cook being in this but he does a good job and is perfect for his part. William Hurt is also very good as Mr. Brooks bad angel. I thought Demi Moore was ok but to be honest I thought that her entire part could have been left out though I think they were going with her bing the Clarice Starling to Costners Lechter.I recommend it. It was creepy, smart and had some pretty funny things in it to break up the tension."
1,Yuck,"Ok, I love Claire Burke, but never tried the original scent. It's has a strange, pine scent -very woody and weird."
4,Howard & Zimmer a brilliant couple!,"Wow, After i saw this movie i just had to get the soundtracks, like someone else said aswell, the music really lifts Batman Begins to a higher level, During the action scene's you clearly hear the move of Zimmer, the heavy and fast paced melody, and at the end of those songs, during emotional or dramatic scene's you will hear the beautiful, touching tunes of James Newton Howard which are perfectly played into each other which fits so well! I really started to love James newton howard's work after i saw movie's such as Signs & The village, The music for the village is really a art on its own, and James gets real close by doing it again in Batman begins... As allready has been announced, Batman Begins will continue and i really hope that both of them will sign up again for the 2e project because these two men are creating rememberable score's! Go get the soundtrack!"
2,Typical film score,"Many reviewers have noted that Zimmer and Howard have abandoned Elfman's themes and approaches to Batman. While the composers were certainly rigth to do so (after all, who's going to top Elfman at his own game?), in my opinion they did not create a new and refreshing work, but rather another mediocer Hollywood score. What makes Elfman, Shore, or Williams so memberable is the fact that they compose self contained musical works that happen to be attached to a movie. In contrast, Zimmer and Howard have composed a few minutes of mood music that, without Nolan's film filling in the blanks, convey nothing of importance. This makes for an excellent movie, but a rather uninteresting score."
5,Friends of Weezer,"Great EP from a now defunct band which was made up of Rod Cervera (long time colaborator of Matt Sharp of Weezer and The Rentals fame), Cherielynn Westrich, Mike Fletcher, and Graciela Germann. The three song EP envokes the sound of another defunct project That Dog. It has a considerably So-Cal feel to the songs, Pinkslip, 17 Braids, and I Love Christian Stone.Recommended for those who love Weezer, The Rentals, Space Twins, The Special Goodness, That Dog, and Jimmy Eat World.1995 Boy's Life Records"
5,Get Back in Control of Your Home,"When you can't stand the clutter any longer, check out this book for some great organizational tips. Bring your entire house back into order."
1,This Will NOT Work in Kyocera Strobe Phone!!,"I personally will not ever be buying anything from Bargain Cell. This battery will not work in my Kyocera phone, as advertised at the time of purchase. This was the second time I ordered through Bargain Cell, and my first item was not as advertised either."
1,This is not the real thing!,"I ordered this battery thinking it was as described; however, as soon as I inserted it, my phone identified that it was not a genuine Kyocera battery and refused to charge it. I returned it and they did give me credit for the battery itself, but I was still out S&H both ways."
4,The next step up for UO,"I'v been playing since the beta testing, and I am thoroughly impressed with the new look, the new graphics, and the new lands. I did go out and upgrade my graphics card from an ATI 128 to a Creative Wonders Annihilator when I found performance of the client jagged. If you have a good graphics card, this will run well out of the box. The game as released does crash occasionally (like every few hours for me), but so do most other games sold, and I expect Origin to provide patches for every single problem. I took one star off the 5 star rating, because while this is a great improvement, it's a far cry from the canceled UO2 and the Ultima IX engine. Also, I believe the system requirements listed are borderline. If you already play UO, this upgrade is recommended for its graphical beauty, if your machine can take it. If you are a new player, hop on the train now. You will not be disappointed."
2,An utter disapointment,"As a longtime player of Ultima Online, I am really really disapointed by Third Dawn.The graphics are superb and to play UO in 3D after years of playing in 2D was fresh. And that's about the only thing good about the game.I tried walking around and the whole thing was jerky and slow. Bad enough I already lag badly playing UO but add that to the screen jerkiness and you can see my disapointment. Add that to the number of times the game crashed and you have a crap game.I don't dare bring my character to the Third Dawn world to hunt because I am scared I will crash and die. A sad addon to an otherwise great game."
1,Horrible Disappointment,"After playing Ultima Online for over two years - I joined the Beta Test of this game. They are releasing the game well before it is ready. There are memory leaks, the grahics are horrible and it is laggy as a game can get. Unfortunately, a once great game has been ""corporatized"" and is dying. I would suggest not purchasing this game as the flaws are too numerous to list. UO is ""hoping"" to patch this ""gold CD"" after you buy it. Check the UO.com message boards for more information on how the customers feel."
2,EQ wannabie scam by EA to get your money.,"Ultima been unique world with many aspects to it for last 2 years until about a year ago when OSI&EA started gearing all toward making it more like monster bashing camp-o-rama EQ. UO lost its uniqueness and if you want same but better experience buy yourself Diablo2 and spare pains of monthly fee, system lag and unstable clients with overloaded servers at prime time; with simplistic magic system (only 64 spells and about half ever get used), primitive melee fighting (you can only bash) with hardly functional magic items system (uses worthless spell & chares system) and bad 3D graphics. After all these disadvantages game requires HIGH end system and don't expect it to run any good on anything below P600 256Mb ram and TnT2 32MB card (UO3D has barely supports Voodoo and ATI cards)."
4,Good overview of the operations before the Rhine in 1945,"The clear intention of The Rhineland 1945 book is to provide neophite military buff or the beleagured student of history with a barebones generalized overview of the operations leading up to the crossing of the Rhine in March 1945. Anyone familiar with this period, wanting more specialized or in-depth studies would, I would presume, know well enough that based on the format of the series, that one is not to expect all that much from such a slim volume. That said, I find this book to be an very good introduction to this period of the war in Western Europe. The book is written in such a way that it can stand alone or act as a continuation of the books dealing with earlier campaigns. I found the format logical, the layout and design excellent, and the selection of pictures suitable for evoking the realities of the fighting conditions."
4,The Lockhart Collection of Chinese Copper Cash,"The coin book often identifies coins not found in Scjoth's ""Currency of the Far East"". It also works well as a double-identification cross-reference (with numbers) for those also in Scjoth's. I feel that, at least, double identification numbers are necessary to authenticate, properly. The book gives 1975 coin values, but multiplied by one plus one-half of the world inflation rate since 1975 (1.18 by my calculations for the period 1975-1999)gives me a feel for what ""I am"" willing to pay. Perhaps others are willing to pay the full inflation rate. Unfortunately, it doesn't cover Annam, Japan, Korea, etc.. Also, a few of the pictures are close to being inkblots. Were it not for these last items, I would've rated it a 5 for layout and organization."
3,a good suspenseful quick read,This is a good book for attorneys to read while in the airport. It is equally good for vacation reading. Cleveland readers will recognize the locale.
4,Wonderful Movie,"This movie is very educational and wonderful. I think it depicts the issues Panda's face today being on the list of extinction. We need to help these creatures flourish in the wild and in captivity, and stop the endless killing of these beautiful animals."
3,Pretty grim.,Not sure what I was expecting but I found this interesting but of limited watchability if that is a word. I prefer working steam trains and much of this is historical picture of wrecks or drawings of same. It would make a better book than a video. In videos you want to see movement. This is like seeing a video of the Mona Lisa. It just sits there.
1,Can't stand the show,"Despite the fact that this show does have talented singers, they squander the whole casts talent with awful dialogue and attempted plot twists. They tried to make a huge deal about a character coming out, which was hard to feel for since he talked about his tiara collection prior to his great revealing attempt of self identity. The dialogue throughout every episode is absolutely awful. None of it is real, nor does it contain any action that anyone would actually do. Not to mention the false portrayal of show choir competitions. Just say no to Glee!"
4,Everyone is female!,"Wouldn't you want to land on a planet where everyone is female? Well, that is what our hero gets to do. He has plenty of problems once he gets there though. Apparently a colony ship with an all-female complement went off course and landed on an uncharted planet. (A feature of this line of Anderson stories is the ""trepidation vortex"" which can do just that.) The ship's doctor developed a method of cloning the women thus creating a population of identical copies from maybe 50 individuals. The hero doesn't get the girl, at least not during the story, but he has plenty of adventures with an identical pair of fiery (in both hair and spirit) gorgeous redheads. (Anderson loves redheads!) Note that in decisions that must be made involving genetically identical individuals, the roll of the dice is sacred."
5,Driving Tunes,"Windows down, empty road, sun shining and Hootie & The Blowfish blasting. They have the best driving and thinking music. This CD makes your hand tap the steering wheel and relate to a memory you can smile at. Great CD, great band."
3,Best since Cracked Rear View,"Cracked Rear View was one of those rare albums where everything is done just right. Everything! Unfortunately, having an outstanding debut album puts some heavy expectations on a band. Hootie and the Blowfish didn't really come close to matching their initial success with Fairweather Johnson and Musical Chairs. I almost gave up, when this self-titled album came out.It comes close. You can feel the energy that made Hootie so great on the tracks Innocence and Little Brother. This album is decent, which is an improvement. A few of the other tracks are okay, but some just seem like filler. I'm hoping this album puts this talented band back on the right track. True fans will enjoy this latest offering."
5,Well done,"At 98% polyphenols, it's potent. You're not taking a lot of filler here. The pills are very durable and only slightly larger than average caps, but not objectionable. I've yet to find a product with as high a percentage of poly... it's a little pricey, but when you look at the potency, it's actually a good deal. I like the decaf version too. I would recommend to all of my friends."
2,Decaf green tea extract,I thought I was getting decaf coffee extract. I have been taking it as directed and don't notice anything different.
5,"Steve , We wait for the DVD ...","I hope that Steve will do the right thing, like Satriani, and he will make a dvd of this live performence. In 2001 all good live performences would be edited together with their dvd."
3,BORRRRRRRRRRRRING,This cd is very goofy. Not much burning. Songs are weak. Pass on this one. Check out Dream Theater
4,mesmerizing,i love steve vai.. and i think this is one of his best CDs.. i personally am biased towards live recordings anyway...you don't have to be a rack fan to enjoy this.. it is just pure music from a musician who loves playing his instrument.. so easy to get lost in it..you won't regret buying this..
4,A must-read,"If you are interested in the 20th century history of Jews in Eastern Europe, then this is a must-read book. It is difficult to read as we are not familiar with the places, people, or events that Ansky spoke about. And these are not pleasant events to read about. But we need to know this things, if we are to understand what happened to our families during World War I, even before they were annihilated in World War II. I highly recommend this book to historians and genealogists alike."
2,More compelling than ALI with Will Smith,"The day after I paid to see the film ALI, starring Will Smith, THE GREATEST, starring Muhammad Ali (playing himself), showed up on cable television. I had high hopes for ALI and low expectations for THE GREATEST.The better picture? THE GREATEST. That's not saying much (if you saw ALI), but if nothing else THE GREATEST is worth a look for Muhammad Ali's charming performance. THE GREATEST offers several compelling scenes, even if they don't add up to a coherent film, all anchored by the ever-watchable Ali.As the 5/30/00 review points out, Muhammad Ali doesn't sanitize himself in THE GREATEST. However, the movie's 1960s documentary fight footage followed by Ali, age 36, playing himself at age 22, breaks your concentration. Thankfully, talented actors, including Ernest Borgnine, James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall, help Ali pull it together. See THE GREATEST."
4,Songs from your favourite musicals in a new era,"Love Broadway musicals like ""Les Miserables?"" Have a passion to dance? Your favourite songs from your favourite musicals never sounded like this before! Harajuku creates the perfect ambiance to which you can dance... the best dance clubs from around the globe already recognize the musical mastery of this artist -- shouldn't you? Highlights include ""On my Own"" (Les Miserables) and ""Colours of the Wind"" (Pocahontas)... these rather slow songs have a new, up-beat tempo that will get you off -- your chair, that is! You'll want to dance every night away!! *Note: Only 4 stars were granted because Harajuku's work is mostly inspired by the live stage productions of the musicals presented."
5,"LOVE TIM McGRAW, THIS IS NO EXCEPTION !","Everything Tim McGraw does it AWESOME ! love it ! I will continue to buy Tim products, have been a fan since Indian outlaw, don't see myself ever not being a Tim fan !"
2,Disappointed,"I have thoroughly enjoyed every Tim Mcgraw cd I've purchased, but this one just doesn't grab me. I've listened to it a few times, but I think it has too many ballads. It's basically all ballads. The three songs I do like are 'Angry All The Time', 'Let Me Love You', 'Grown Men Don't Cry'.Just my $.02."
2,not impressed,"I was very excited that his new CD was coming out. I have to say that I was not overly impressed with this effort. ""Telluride"", ""Things Change"", and ""Grown Men don't Cry"" are the only songs worth listening to more than once. The rest of the songs are just average. This album is not even close to being as good as his previous two. ""Let Me Love You"" is an embarrasment to country music. ""Angry all the Time"" is a pretty good song too. Don't buy unless you a die hard fan."
2,Hang 'em up!,"Everybody knows that Tim McGraw is a talented guy, but I guess that most of his talent has been consumed recently by his relationship with Faith Hill. The catchy tunes and nice rhythms that seemed to explode out of his last album, ""A Place in the Sun,"" are not present here. And what's up with this circus stuff, anyways? Maybe he should just leave that over-rated wench wife of his and join the circus. Heck, after this album, they might not want him!"
2,Sadly disappointing,"I found much of this album to be dry and lifeless unlike McGraw's previous efforts. The soul seemed gone from both lyrics and music. Perhaps McGraw has been spending a bit too much time being a dad and not enough on being a musician true to his craft. As an example, I actually believe one song in particular would have been better served by a latin artist....""Let Me Love You"". Not only does the music actually go faster than McGraw can seem to catch up to, there is also no urgency to his voice in a song which should be filled with emotion. Sorry to say, McGraw needs to back to the studio."
2,Agreed - Poor edition of a great book,"I just wanted to agree with the other reader who said this was a poor edition of a great book. On my version, either the cover is upside-down, or all the inside pages are. Sure, it still *works* fine, but having to turn a book upside-down before reading it is just ... wrong. No, this is not just reading from the back like a Hebrew Bible, this is actually upside-down. I've seen other editions of Gesenius without this problem, so I know it's just this one."
1,Awful,This camera stinks the pictures turn out horrible and the quality is bad I woudnt waist your time and money you could loose great pictures
1,waste of money,"Bought this to use as a webcam. Piece of junk; images very jaggy, focus is an oxymoron. VERY disappointed with it. As for a standalone digital camera, save your money and get something that isn't made of plastic, has some sort of zoom, and can be focused. Nothing good about this thing."
2,Spend more money,"Small size, light weight, and easy to use don't make up for poor picture quality and especially poor lighting (even in a well lit room). I'll be returning this asap."
1,Don't waste your money,"It looks a nice camera but DON'T waste your money and don't waste your time. It is impossible to get a sharp picture with this camera. Besides, if you are able to find a way to make the camera work in connection with you computer, you will have a very bad web camera. I looked through all their tech support, but couldn't find anything useful. I sent a message to the technical support they never answer my questions. I'm very disappointed and I will NEVER, EVER buy anything from Aiptek again."
2,Argh!,"I bought this DV camcorder thing thinking that it would be a great little camera/camcorder to take on vacations and to capture those unforgetable moments with. Boy was I mistaken! When it starts up, it makes a little tinny boop-boop-boop sound. The image on the lcd screen is horrendously grainy and the sound quality is extremely bad. Overall this camera is pretty bad. It also doesnt have a flash so you cant take pictures in low light. You also have to turn on the backlight to see the picture on the lcd and there is no zoom. The viewfinder is almost impossible to look through and it sucks up battery life like a hoover. Im selling mine at a garage sale."
4,DON'T EXPECT TO CONTACT ANYONE AT AIPTEK THOUGH!!,"The product and performance is 10,000 times better than the business. I lost my USB cable and have been trying to get a replacement for over a week. I tried to order is on line but get notification that the Purchase and the Accessories pages are FORBIDDEN!!! ACCESS IS NOT ALLOWED!!I have called daily and no one responded to any of my voice messages. Finally got though to someone and was told that no one can take an order on the phone and I had to wait for the site to be upgraded. HE didn't know how many days it would take -- SO - I can't download any PICS until they decide to upgrade. Guess this camera will end up in the 'mistake' trash can."
3,It was OK,"This wasn't as boring as some of her other novels. After the first 3 chapters the story picks up a little. However, I will say that I did not like the character Joe at all, and thought Kate was stupid to keep going back to him. She would have been much better off with Andy."
2,"WAY too much""break-up, make-up""","I hadn't read a Danielle Steele novel in a few years but decided to give this one a try since I am always interested in the 1940's time period - as well as romances set around WWII. I won't be reading another of hers anytime soon. It seemed like the plot was stuck in one place and didnt EVER go anywhere. Throughout the entire book, it was ""Kate loves Joe, Joe is no good for Kate but he loves her too... fate keeps bringing them together, they break up.... back together - even though he is still bad for her...."" on and on. Frankly I was disappointed. Guess I'll stick with some other authors who can actually write a story that has more than one theme."
2,Dumb Drivel,"My sister warned me when I was into the book about 25 pages that by the end of it I would hate these characters. Truer words were never spoken! I hate to say it but I think Danielle is getting senile. She repeats herself CONSTANTLY. All through the book she describes these people over and over again ad nauseum. I bet these tired descriptions take up half the book. Surely she doesn't need the money that badly that she's cranking out this drivel. Telling the ending at the beginning was a huge mistake. After that, you basically knew what was going to happen. I used to read her books from cover to cover but this one, I'm basically just trying to get through it."
3,This book was a little confusing....,"The love story in this book was very good to read but I didn't get the fact that this guy couldn't commit. She waited for so long for him and he never came. Then when he thought he could be a man and marry her he chickens out and starts up on this man self pity putting business before family. I think that the girl should have never cheated on her husband who was perfect and so very good to her. But yet again, if she didn't realize that and cheated on him with a good for nothing self absorbed man, she didn't deserve him. I really didn't get the end either. She totally changed her image and just took [everything] from this guy. It really wasn't like a real marraige. This book started out good but ended up [bad]. Not my favorite from the Steel collection."
1,new york nights - dvd,"New York Nights (dvd)9/19 - An ghastly, bootleg, illegal issue (manufactured from an old Vestron VHS) put out with a redoctered cover by Jeff Aikman, Televista, Ma., a petty video-crook, working the sewers of the business looking for edible crumbs. His distributor, Music Video Distributors, Oaks, PA 19456 has taken this issue off the market and ceased all distribution.Romano Vanderbes, ITM, Inc., NY, NY 10022 (US Copyright ownwer)"
1,Cut version.,"The DVD lies when writes on the back: ""Digitally remastered"" and ""Full length feature film"". The image is very poor, and one of the two best scenes with Corinne Alphen, the first one, when she is in a limo with a rock star, it is incomplete, it is cut."
4,Great toy,I got this for my 9 month old nephew for christmas. He likes it alot and so does my two year old :) It is great because it gets him moving around the house chasing after it. Would probably encourage a baby to crawl if they werent already. I would buy this toy again.
5,LOVE it,"My 7-month-old loves this toy. He's crawling already, and chases the train and balls with fierce determination. He's mesmerized by the train and ball movement. I have a feeling that he'll enjoy it for a long while."
4,Not bad,"We bought this toy for our 9 month old after reading all the great reviews. He plays with the train and the balls separately but isn't quite into the ball popping yet. I guess he'll get there. He does like to put the balls inside. The music isn't too bad either. Over all it is a good toy I think, he just needs time with it."
2,Do I have the same toy?,"My long-awaited, spoiled baby daughter has so many toys a lot of our friends comment that we should open a daycare center (no thanks!). This is one of the toy purchases I truly regret. I am putting it in the attic because it NEVER gets used. I keep showing it to my baby, who's now 21 months old, but we both think the same thing - BORING. BTW, we've had it for about a year now, and she's never been interested in it, so I don't think she ever will be. Save your money and buy the Playskool Busy Ball Popper instead - loads of fun for about the same amount of money. As an added bonus, even the older kids from the neighborhood love to play with the Ball Popper (even up to age 14), especially when it has fresh batteries and the balls pop all over the place! Take my advice - if you're trying to decide between these 2, get the ball popper and leave this one behind."
1,"Squirrel's ignored this ""treat""","I put this out and left it for over a week and it was completely ignored. They much prefer the Birdola 54332 Squirola Big Ol-Feet Kob-Feet Squirrel Food. Watching them in my small back yard was very enjoyable until I put out the ""log"". I ended up throwing it in the lake which the snapping turtles & fishes enjoyed very much. I guess it gets very soft or something because it didn't last very long at all."
1,Must be a rigional thing.,"We've got lots of squirrels on the property, but I've had two of these out for two weeks, and not even a nibble on either of them. They're cheap enough to give it a shot, but I'm about to throw them in the compost bin. BTW, I live in the SF Bay Area, and it's getting cold and all the critters are chowing down on everything they can get their hands on... except these. Hmmm maybe I can use them as repellents in some way?"
3,They prefer birdseed!,Thought I'd try this item to deter the squirrels from eating all the bird seed. Placed the squirrel feeder about 50 feet from the bird feeders. Had it about a month and they are still eating more than their share of seed and have nibbled a few times on the Squirrelog. Guess when all the seed is gone they'll chew on the squirrelog.
5,Simply Harmony,"I never heard of Abigal until several months back when I heard ""Constantly Craving"" on the radio. It's taken me a long time to find out who it was singing that song. She has a beautiful voice, but the harmony was out of this world. I've never heard any thing like it before. It's great. Everything just seemed to fit and blend in together. If you haven't heard it before, your mising something truly great."
2,Disappointed,"I am an avid John Saul reader. I have loved all his books until this one. It's too typical of any other thriller, but not""creepy"" like his other books. I highly anticipated this book, but must say I am very disappointed in it. It definitely doesn't hold up to his other novels."
1,"YUCK, YUCK, YUCK","Horrid, absolutely horrid is the only way to describe this book. Last few John Saul books have been the same. Last book of his I read. You have to wonder: what happened to John in his childhood to have such gruesome stories come out of his head.Don't bother with it."
2,Garmin,The device is okay but it's not serving the purpose at which it was bought. I'd rather prefer buying garmin gps 76. That's is more ideal.
4,Sylvia NYLA review,"I loved the style, and materials (textures and colors) on this shoe, which is why I ordered it. I rarely pay this much for shoes online. I did have trouble in the area of fit around the ankle strap. I concluded that the fit problem was because the shoe was too big for me. I ordered a half-size smaller and could have gone even a half-size smaller again, I think. I always wear a true 8.5, so I recommend ordering one or two half-sizes smaller than your true size on this shoe. I am going to make my new 8.0 work if it kills me!"
1,It Doesn't Work,The Chessmaster 9000 doesn't work on my MacBook Pro with up-to-date OS. I don't know how to update the 9000. It just isn't supported anymore and have I found nothing helpful on line.
2,"Yuck, get another chess program...","Based on the strengths of the reviews here, I bought the program. It looked great-that is, until I ran the program. It is horribly slow, first of all. It is sluggish even when making a move, and crashes often. Definetly not recommended for slow Macs. The interface is also poor-windows are everywhere, making it hard to use them and play at the same time. The tutorials are not bad, though. Overall, I don't think it's worth it."
1,"Fat, slow and a lot of trouble","You can get sleek FREEWARE from sigma that blows this bloated buggy mess away. It interferes with other stuff, you have to have the DVD in and it is a mess that messes up your mac. Run for your life. UGH!"
2,Not a phenomenon,"I was a freshman at CCM when we put on a first-rate production of this play. I had read it years before when it became the 'phenomenon' it has been labeled since its opening. But unless you see it onstage with all the magic played out in front of you, you are likely to feel you are being preached at. Yes, it is the first play of its kind to put modern society's true feelings towards homosexuals and AIDS under the microscope; but it reads like Kushner tried too hard to find just the right words to preach at his audience. However, I do appreciate the characterization of Roy Cohn and Joe Harper and it is worth reading if you are interested in plays that turn against society."
1,A Piece of Garbage,"This book was assigned to me as college reading and all I can say is that I am offended with the language and feel verbally abused by the content. The author is abusing the audience. I have friends whom are gay and they never talk like the trash that represnt them in this book, they hold themselves to a higher level and have class. The author creates gay hatred instead of encouraging people to embrace the gay culture. This book makes you think gays have no sense and that they are wierd instead of just average people. I believe the author has hurt the gay community more then he has helped."
1,Don't waste your time,There are no words to adequately describe how bad this play was. Had to read it for an undergrad course and it was quite possibly the worst thing I've ever read.
2,Not for me,I found it boring and uninspiring. I wanted a more encouraging instructor and more direction. It's been along time since I practiced ballet. Someone one else may love it.
5,Ballet Class Victor Kabaniaev,I bought this DVD several years ago and return to it time and time again because the exercises work all the muscles in the body and are beautifully demonstrated by Victor. My only regret is that he does not do more centre exercises. I am looking forward to his next DVD and hope it will be longer.
2,Wrong Color,"I like the product, but I ordered the (3) RED mini vinyl shoes as pictured to replace one my dog had and got (3) black ones instead. My floor is dark and dog has black coat , so hard to find."
5,Must read for any runner,"No matter what level you are this is a great book about this amazing young man. What he accomplished in such a short time is simply amazing.The author was kind enough to give us details about the training, meets and Prefontaine's personal life but not so much that it was intolerable.I think the author showed us enough of the man to understand that there will never be another one like him but there is no reason that more of us couldn't try to aspire to what he accomplished...I'm not talking about the running times because there is no one I know that could come close to that!!"
3,How can the B-boys swindle more money from you?,"Ooh, part 2 has an Alive remix, and a Jam cover ""Start."" I wish the boys would release those action figure dolls and fatten their pockets even more."
1,"Not ready for ""prime time""!","I'd like to think that I'm a fair minded person, but as hard as I try, I can't think of anything positive to say about this expensive paperweight! It has little, if any, discernment over which sounds are your commands, and which are the sounds from the television/audio center...and that's if you can get so far as to get it to do ANYTHING but flash the LED light. Operations defined in the manual often don't coincide with what happens when you follow the instructions and press the keys. It simply is a bad piece of product design, however well thought out it may have been, in the concept stages.To make matters worse, just try accessing the manufacturer's web site. They're either down, or already are out of business...Avoid this device like the plague!"
3,"This is an IR Only Product, no RF","This means that any components that are RF-controlled such as a few top-end receivers (made by Kenwood and Bose and perhaps others) are not controllable by this remote. My Kenwood instructions indicated that the Kenwood remote is dual mode--both IR and RF. But I learned too late that the receiver is RF only, and that the IR is only included in the remote to operate other components. This means that the Invoca that I bought cannot operate the the RF-only receiver. No good. Otherwise, I like the product and would certainly recommend it for IR-only households."
1,Hold Them Away,"Jennifer Lopez has really been one of those very few artists that really has overshowcased her feeling as somebody who really can't sing. Not that she has is a very well put actress, but her collaborations really don't even hit that nail on the head. Her latest single, Hold You Down with rapper Fat Joe is a very wimpy and not even well put song. It actually sounds more like it is very bland. They've both collaborated before on Fellin' So Good which was a little more upbeat, and catchy. This song isn't even as close to adequate from Jenny from the block. As for Fat Joe, he should consider going back to hard core than playboy.Song: F+"
4,Great movie for Mass Effect fans,"This is definiately different to what Mass Effect fans are used to playing on the game with the high end Unreal game engine. The disappointing factor I had was that this movie wasn't made into that those kind of detail graphics. If it ended up like that I would have loved it more.Even though I have seen Ghost in the Shell, the same director who directed it and got involved with this Mass Effect movie. Overall the animation wasn't too disappointing, it was quite interesting overall and the overall movie is worthwhile watching. If you have any reservations there was a 9min video or preview on Youtube floating around, Isuggest to reserve your judgement until you have seen it"
2,Oh the agony!,"Freddie prinze jr. dear god, they left us with the stereotipical black man shepard fanboy that is Jacob in ME2. And now this guy the stereotipical puerto rican shepard fanboy James vega oh joy! Yeah giant sized monkey man fanboy whose decision making skills are worse than 8 year olds. They once again retcon there technology to the point of no returned alla biotics need there own battery charges (STUPID) basically all this is a ham-fisted contrived expose of vega's big decision that winds up falling flat on its ass. Dear BIOWARE stop with the merchandizing your story telling skills are piss poor."
1,"""In Game Multiplayer Bonus Items"" NOT received....","You will not receive an in-game multiplayer bonus item with this purchase. You will get a card with a code that expires on 12/31/2012. Furthermore, even if you do enter the code before 12/31/2012 it will not work. I have an ongoing discussion with support on this, and am getting blown off. Others have had the same experience.The movie itself is pretty awful, but if you were buying it for the in game items you might want to check the Bioware forums to see if they have resolved this issue. I will update this review if the problem is resolved."
4,"Restful for the arm, easy to use","After having some shoulder pains, I decided to get this mouse for home to use. I've been using it for a week and it has helped. Still getting used to some of the movement, especially for a game I play, but for everything else, it works well. Some oddities in the clicking behavior, where I'll click on a page and the page will move instead of clicking through a link, but that's the only problem I've seen. The customizable buttons are nice, especially the one by the thumb used for back, very nice."
2,Why so expensive?,"Prosmitigates pain better than any mouseCons$60 - for what? ( some plastic in a different shape).The first click - the mouse jumps 3 spaces from the target.On some programs the mouse ""freezes"" - you have to unplug it to get it to work.One size doesn't fit all.The 5 buttons get in the way because you tend to squeeze the bottom one - had to turn it into a 3 button mouse.Wire isn't very durable so mouse breaks if it falls - which it does.$100 for plastic to fit the left hand?Made in China for God's sakes!Why so expensive?"
3,"For this RSI sufferer, mouse click was too stiff for me","I have RSI which causes weakness and pain in my fingers and really wanted to like this mouse. I love the design, but unfortunately the mouse click button was too stiff for me and the 90% vertical angle was uncomfortable for my arm.I felt pain after 20 minutes of using the vertical mouse and went back to my old Logitech mouse (the big funky one that's contoured to my hand shape).I don't think this problem would affect regular people, but just wanted to put these facts out there for anyone in the same boat as me."
4,From underground to the surface,"I have yet to see this movie, but I was given a vivid picture from reading this book. Being placed in the 1930's, I was almost expecting to be taken to a time and place alien to me. I was astounded in the way O'Hara's society hasn't changed much from the one today. The only difference is that the issues in this novel are more plevalent today than in the hidden crevices of yesterday.I attribute this comparison to his level of writing. If everyone could write like this, all books would be timeless. As well as the lush descriptions of New York, from the start, it is difficult not to feel for Gloria. The rest of the story tries to explain why she is such a person to feel for.I enjoyed seeing a colorful portrait of the thirties as well as getting swept up in the tragic story of a girl who has an inevitable future."
5,I love this color,"I just love this color, but unfortunately I can't find it in the stores anymore... I recently colored my hair w/another brand & another shade of black but I'm really disappointed w/the results. Amazon I beg u please don't do what the stores did, please don't discontinue this product!"
4,Back in the 50's Again!,"I loved this movie. The 50's environment was so exciting and since it was my favorite decade it was a pleasure to see. The storyline was simple but good - not great, but good and the characters were wonderful. This is pure entertainment with a 50's touch....right down to the music and Nancy Allen turning on a TV and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" was playing. I enjoyed every minute of this movie and I think most people will too."
1,"OH,YEAH,OKAY,SURE?","A cast of 10, a collage campus you can use during spring break.The only creativity in this picture was when someone found the Djinn's costume in an old wardrobe department.After this I refuse to see the fourth one,lmao!!Never paid attention to the fact that the Djinn neded 1000 souls first.But what the hell, had a couple real taste bud babes in it, and that is all you really need for a great movie, right?....."
1,Why does this movie suck?,"I own the first 2 Wishmaster films and they are supremely excellent. I got this one, 'cause I figured ""What the hell?"". How wrong I was. This movie was about as interesting as root canal. Whoever that guy was playing the Djinn should've read up about the character more. I agree with a previous review...give Andrew Divoff what he wants so that he'll make this Wishmaster entry a good one. Or at least a decent one. From what I've seen of Wishmaster 4, it seems as though it might be a bad one as well. Hopefully for Wishmaster 5, Divoff will return for one last Djinn movie. We can all hope, right?"
2,The Horseman Was Nowhere Near the Barn,"I typically love the Patterson books, but he's now getting into the crank it out rut. Where's the intrigue and excitement? Where's the character development? We don't get inside the mind of any of the killers, which is something JP does so well in the Alex Cross books. I was hopeful that this series would continue along those lines, but this book leaves me less optimistic. If you're looking for a light read, no thinking novel, this is it. JP, bring us back your classic writing! Our minds needs more entertainment than this!"
1,Madrebooks,"I never received this book and was never granted a refund. TOTAL rip-off! Beware buyers of Madrebooks, they will take your money and never deliver the products."
5,Exactly what I expected!,This book arrived on time in the exact condition as I had expected. I would definetly order from this seller again.
3,Why do authers lean on ghost writers or name them?,"I'm tired of the writings of my favorite authers being corrupted by other no name people. James Patterson is James Patterson. Stop selling out your readers. Look at Ludlum they are going to make a fortune of his name with new reworked plots and half finished story lines. I want 100% James,Ludlum,Cussler....Stop selling out your art for profit and commercialism. be the writer your fans know and love. Lucky to have met alex!Sincerely RJ."
3,Quick Read But Silly 'Girls',"Although I like smaller chapters in a book, having 180+ or so is a tad much! However, that is endurable, but the women this series is portraying are not: they are barely recognizable as 'professional' women, and more & more like silly teenage girls. They are getting to be less & less believable, and I expect that in the next book they will all be giggling repeatedly as they gossip and muse... Could we have some intelligent female characters written in, please?????????"
2,Ridiculous,"Sadly, this is a terrible amalgam of plastic characters, pathetic dialogue,and ridiculous science. ""i'll kill her with this syringe of insulin!"" impossible."
5,Superb,It's action packed and never a dull momentAlso it keeps getting better once you start reading it's hard to put it down
4,Patterson's Book,"this is my fifth book of women's murder club. i obviously like the book, although it took me a long time to get it loaded to my kindle for some reason."
2,5th Horseman,I have read many James Patterson books and started to get involved with the Women's Murder Club series. I read 1-4 and was excited to get to the 5th. I was extremely disappointed as this one moved much too fast and had an extremely terrible ending. It left me with a huge question mark as to how the murderer was found. There was nothing in the whole book that I could remember (and being a kindle edition was hard to go back)that indicated there was anyone else involved.I think he should slow down and think about what he is writing and look at the reader's side for interpretation. I will now go and read other authors for a while since the Women's Murder Club books have lost their appeal for me at this time.
2,"James, You can do better!","I have already purchased ""Beach Road"", and will read it soon. I wish JP would stop turning out books so fast and spend a little more time perfecting his work. The old spark just isn't there for me any longer. I love that his work continues to be fast-paced but it has also become so ""Ho-Hum"". So come on James, dump all of these co-authors and get back to what you are so capable of. A die hard fan just expecting what I know JP can do!"
5,"Works great, makes coffee as good as a coffee house","I've had this two years with no problem & was able to replace a carafe I broke from with a replacement from Amazon. I replaced a free coffee maker (Mr Coffee or Black & Decker, can't remember) that came with coffee from an online order service. I immediately noticed better tasting coffee. Water brew temperature on temperature setting ""6"" is 195 degrees, right in the range to brew coffee. I use the ""pro aroma"" setting, since after experimenting with that setting once seemed to result in better coffee. I need to find a manual so I can see what the settings are supposed to do. My only regret is not getting a model with a thermal carafe, but I usually make & drink 30 ounces before it gets cool."
3,Died after 2 years,We received this coffeemaker as a wedding gift. It worked great and made great coffee for two years. Then suddenly the digital display went blank and we could only get it to turn on sporadically. It seems that the coffee-making function is perfectly fine but something is wrong with it electronically. We took it to a repair shop and they claimed it was a problem with the thermostat and said they had just replaced the thermostat on 5 other Krups coffeemakers. However that didn't solve the problem - the digital display immediately went out again. We are now going to shop for a coffeemaker with fewer bells and whistles so we can count on a longer lifetime. Just wanted to warn other shoppers about this one.
4,Another Good Installment in this Series,"Box has a great lead character in Pickett and the supporting cast is equally strong. His writing style is smooth and keeps one hooked from the very first page. I was not crazy about the plot - though it was filled with twists and turns, some suspended belief to a degree. That's fine in crime fiction obviously - I just felt this one was a little TOO over the top. Still a great read nonetheless; if you like Box and the Pickett series, you won't go wrong here."
2,Interesting Premise but a very poor execution,"Joe Pickett is quite a decent character for along running series and Wyoming is certainly an interesting setting.The author writes quite well when describing scenery and the dialogue between the hero and his wife and daughters is quite believable. There are lots of family scenes, however it does begin to get repetitive. His wife has now got a job so we are constantly told that she no longer cooks for the family and that the refrigerator is empty.This starts off quite well. The premise is quite intriguing. Unfortunately the more you read the sillier it gets. It is just incredibly unrealistic. People act in ridiculous ways. At times it is almost childlike in its simplicity. The police procedural and forensic elements never ring true.It does get very predictable and it seemed that the author got bored with a few plot threads and just forgot about them.The supernatural element is very poorly developed and doesn't really fit into the rest of the story."
4,Great Author,"It is so nice to find a good author with all his books. Wilbur Smith, Nelson DeMille, Paul McElroy has many good books and C. J. Box is a good author."
3,Mediocre but fun horror thriller.,"Ho-hum, another ""women in jeopardy from an evil man trying to cure his disfigured face"" horror flick?? But this one is reasonably good fun and is worth seeing. Plenty of gruesome incidents keep the cliche plot moving along. One interesting footnote: we learn quite early in the film that a caged circus gorilla hates the villain. Obviously, he will be killed by the gorilla in the thrilling climax, right? (Unless he first dies of cancer or emphysema caused by his chain smoking.) Wrong. Getting attacked by the gorilla is merely one of about six bad things that happen to him during the last several minutes of the film, before he finally dies."
2,Pity the rest of the cast,"The cast (except for David Hasselhoff) was superb. And the filming of the musical is the best I've seen for a live production. Especially memorable were the songs, ""In His Eyes"", ""A New Life"", and ""When This All Began"". But Mr. Hasselhoff, for all of his 'star quality' was a profound disappointment. ""This is the Moment"" should be a show-stopper, but his performance in this great musical scene was mediocre at best--really it was embarrassingly bad. Mr. Hassellhoff proved that he can neither sing nor act on the stage. What is it about producers of Broadway shows that induces them to cast 'stars' who can't sing? Also, I found the screening edition warning (Property of Goodtimes...), repeatedly displayed on the video, to be ridiculous. It truly damaged the video presentation. All in all, this video was a true disappointment."
4,Too bad they didn't tape the original cast,"I've seen Jekyll and Hyde twice (both times on tour), and I have to say that the strength of the piece obviously relies solely on the strength of the actor/singer in the title roles. Sadly, in this version, the performance given by Hasselhoff is, to put it mildly, poor. The roles come across so much more powerfully if they are sung by someone who has had musical training (at least enough to be able to sing the score of a Broadway musical). It's too bad that the producers chose to tape this performance instead of a performance starring the original cast. Though there may not have been big names, they probably would have had more people willing to pay for the pay-per-view and DVD/VHS versions, especially due to the popularity of the original Lucy, Linda Eder."
4,Hasselhoff was great!,"Have seen other productions of Jekyll & Hyde, with other young stars,they lack the size and body weight, voices were OK. For this production the right person was cast, his voice not perfect in every song, was a good musical play voice. He carried the role very well. I was impressed, my lady friend said "" I have changed my mind about Hasselhoff"". My feelings were the same. He sang well, he had good stage presense. He fit the role well. The songs are great and for most part, his supporting cast was good. Have watched the DVD three times, and enjoyed three times. I was happy that they filmed it as play, and not try to make it into a movie. If Hasselhoff does any other plays in the future, I will go, based on this play. The most diffcult part is when he has to play both parts on stage, he was great!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"I admit to not being a David Hasselhoff fan but I bought this video of Jekyll & Hyde because I love the show and figured if he got the part on Broadway, he must not be as untalented a singer as I thought. I am sad to say that this video was awful. I cannot imagine how David Hasselhoff got this part anywhere much less Broadway. I do not mean to be cruel to him, but he just cannot sing and his acting was a close second. I could bearly sit through the entire video because I was actually so embarrassed for him. I think the ""live"" audience was either his fan club or friends and family. The most intense parts of the show were too forced on his part. It was if he made certain he could sing just as loud at the intense parts of songs as past performers but his voice just does not have the quality of the others. As I said, I do not mean to be mean to him, but I would really advise you not to buy this video unless you really like David Hasselhoff."
1,Who invited David H. to sing?,"I agree with Michael P. Nolan comments but the music.I think the music score is great. The production sucks. David H should stay with cars and the beaches. He destroyed the songs. People, who gave 5 stars probably did not see the original cast on Broadway or didn't hear the CD. I saw 15 minutes on HBO and switched to Disney channel. I would not even spend $3 to rent it."
1,Oh Where Oh Where Are the Voices,"Jekyll and Hyde is Frank Wildhorn's greates creation. I wasn't fortunate enough to see this play on Broadway but I have heard the soundtrack and was blown away. Not only was the music amazing, the story, the songs, and the voices! Where is Linda Eder? Not that Coleen Sexton did a horrible job as Lucy but the role was written especially for Ms. Eder, it only seems right that she should sing the part on the movie. Am I wrong?And then there is David Hasslehoff. I bieleve thats all I have to say on that matter. With all the amazing voices in Broadway (i.e. Colm Wilkinson and Michael Crawford) they choose David Hasslehoff! What were they thinking? Bottom line people, its a great story with great music, but by the soundtrack and use your imaginations.And for those of you who think I'm being harsh, buy the movie after you've heard Colm Wilkinson, Linda Eder, and Christine Noll. I all but guarentee that you'll agree with every word I just said."
3,So - so,"Hmm... Knight Rider singing? That's new. Okay for an amateur but definitely not acceptable for Broadway performance. What an embarrassment (and a slap on the faces of REAL talents not given the opportunity to play the role because they're not high-profile talentless celebrities). To the show's credit, the other performances are okay."
2,Disappointed,"Some of the voices in this production are wonderful; Hasselhoff's, unfortunately, is shaky and thin. But what really disappointed me was the insipidity of the words, melodies, and staging. This musical does not begin to compare with other Broadway shows. I'd rather watch Les Mis again and love it than wince through another viewing of Jekyll."
4,A Wonderful Presentation,"First, I must copliment the Broadway Television Network for such a wonderful transfer of ""Jekyll & Hyde"". Having received and watched the DVD, I must say that the sound and picture quality is excellent. I have given this DVD 4 stars for two reasons: The first is that ""Jekyll & Hyde"" isn't my favorite Broadway show. The second reason is that I'm not too thrilled with the chapter setup on the DVD. Act I is one title with one chaper. Act II is the same way. In the future, I would like to see chapters broken up by scenes and songs (as in other DVDs). So, in conclusion, a wonderful start to a wonderful series of DVDs. Let's hope to see more in the future."
5,Was that a review?,"""A reader from South Alabama"" seems to have confused this review panel with a discussion panel. Did you even read LFIF? Just to show that I'm not a hypocrite, I won't reply to ""A reader from South Alabama"" here since I have already expressed my view of the book. My e-mail address is plain for everyone to see; use it if you want a real response for once."
1,Atheism Develops a Media Culture,"Lately, I have noticed the rise of the ""tv evangelists"" of free thought. When a Christian, Barker was involved in producing some of the most groan inducing versions of the mass marketed American version of ""Christianity."" He has simply switched products. One cannot play his atheist music, for example, without fealing a bit guilty. His ""Happy as can be. . . I am your neighborhood atheist"" gives Shatner a run for his money for unintentional musical parody. Do yourself a favor listen to his music... and then consider: if his music is this bad (where you have some ability to judge and where his ""credentials"" are strongest), what does that suggest about his philosophy?Barker has little or no training in philosophy and then deals with what he has read in a juvenile manner. His story begs several questions. . . including personal motivations for leaving the faith."
4,"Not perfect, but definately worth reading","I really enjoyed this book. It was for the most part smart and thought provoking. I agreed with many of the author's insights and critiques of Christianity, as well as the belief in god as a whole. I did however come across many typographical errors, sloppy editing. My only real complaint about the book is the use of the song lyrics. The lyrics from his Christian songs are funny and make a good point about the childishness of blind faith. His included freethought lyrics have the same laughable, elementary quality. I don't think that's what the author had in mind when he included them. It also seemed that he repeated himself a lot from chapter to chapter to bulk it up a bit. Minor problems that take nothing away from the message. Overall a very good read!"
1,Not a children's book,"The material in this book would serve for a 500 page adult novel, NOT a 130 page juvenile. The Walter Mitty attitude of Park obscures the action and confuses real issues. Viet Nam veterans (I am one) have had it unpleasant enough without this kind of propaganda aimed at kids. If there were any way to rate it less than one star, I would."
5,worth the money,"This product was very satisfactory. It is very well made, like something you would have gotten years ago before all the plastic and junk stuff started coming out. When it says wooden rolling pin, it means wooden!"
3,Old transfer cripples great film,"This early Cinemascope classic deserves better. It is not 16:9, but letterboxed 4:3 with poor resolution and less than perfect color - it appears to be the old laserdisc transfer. It deserves better."
5,Good overall treatment of all the different types of problem,"This is a good overall treatment of all the different types of problems one will need to solve when doing network programming.It clearly explains the difference between the different socket types the pitfalls of each and goes on into more detailed examples on the more complicated topics like the JSDT.Definately found a place on my bookshelf. I did by this right when Java 2 came out. It was the best Java 2 networking book at the time, there might be better ones now, but this one got me going enought to not need to look anymore."
2,Not very deep or inspiring,"I had a basic java networking background, and was hoping to learn some advanced tricks or inspiring ideas. Not in this book. Author doesn't write with much personality either. I'm gonna look for a better book on networking."
1,apple ibook power adapter,apple ibook power adapterthis power adapter is no good the first one quit working and was not giving any power the 2nd one cracked on the end that plugs into the computer so now you have to squeeze it to unplug it also apple needs to redesign the plug for these older model laptops so you dont have to end up spending $80.00 on a new one every year or more
5,Vegetarian Fantastic,"This was my very first vegetarian cookbook I purchased from Walgreens back in the '80s. There is recipes from nearly every culture, which makes it so special. I've made many of them and none were disasters (which is saying something). This book has been a steady standby ever since.Recipes that I've made over and over again are:Zucchini BreadSouth-of-the-border Bean and Rice TostadasTamale Bean PieLentil BurgersQuick Eggplant ParmesanEggplant-Fried RiceI actually wish I could have made all of the recipes to give a true account, but that would be a bit impossible considering the size (100 pages of recipes)."
5,Exelent Book,This Book is a combanation of books 1-4 in Star Trek New Frontier. I just finish reading it and I enjoyed it. It has everything you want in a star trek soy. The plot get you intrested It introduces the caraters it is also aborut relationships. It also has camo by Spock Capitan Pecard and former Capatn now Admral Jelaco. Read this book .
4,coffee plant,Shipped good after a month still looks good and healthy. I have no problems with it. Satisfied. Who knows maybe I'll get coffee beans to use.
4,Great first race track,"We got this for our 5 year old for Christmas. All he wanted was a race track, and this seems to have fit the bill. I have as much fun or more as he does. Our only complaint is that after a while the cars don't work as well coming out of the start box. They seem to spin their wheels a bit and then not have enough power left to get around the loops. When we just do it by hand, they do fine. We may try the set-up for one continuous loop next. Easy to put together, easy to use, looks cool, and it's fun."
2,Not worth $50,"Set up took about 20 minutes, cars make it once around the track but fly off of the track if wound up enough to try to make 2 laps. I suspect it will be played with for a week or so then discarded. A shame."
3,lots of fun,"The cars and track are easy to assemble and work great, just that I think they are tad overpriced, considering everything except the cars is cheap. nevertless they are a lot of fun and my 4 yr old loves to race them with me. you can use your imagination to change the track config and thats adds possibilities. The donwside is the cars coudl stop functioning, 2 come with this set, one fo them stopped working in less than 3 days of use, the other one is still running after nearly 3 weeks of use..so.."
3,Good Fighting but very bad story line,"I purchased this video because of all the credit it recieved in the review section. But, when I watched it I was saying, ""What the hell is going on?"". The movie brought in characters with out providing a introduction, and it jumps from scene to scene. I have to admit the fighting scenes where good, especially the awesome leg fighter. But due to the lack of a developed story, which leaves you in confusion, I found this movie a little bit boring. Although, if you just like to watch fight scenes, I recommend it because there is a ton of them!"
2,"Wow, was this done as a school project?",You won't EVEN get a chance to miss the storyline about racial/cultural clashes and the subplots of commitment phobia and filial duty/responsibility -- it's all laid out for you like a paint by numbers kit.There are a couple of funny scenes and the subplot of the roommate and girlfriend was well done.The characters are all overplayed and the acting was amateurish and stiff but it was obvious that the attempt was sincere and that the people involved wanted to do a good job.The movie is worth seeing but keep in mind that this was a low budget project.
4,"hilariously helpful, I think?","This author starts out through the forest of New Age philosophies by giving us a test! Yes, you're going to be tested on how you lived your life! That's what reincarnation is really all about. What grade are YOU going to get when you sign-out?Hester Mundis is determined to teach us all that she knows. Believe me, Hester knows it all! From Astral Plane Reservations thru Karma, Karma, Karma Chameleons to Creative Visualizations for All Occasions to Holistic Housekeeping - that's one of my favorites!From Entertaining Negatives and Other New Age Gaffes to Why Good things Happen to Bad People to We Are All Food to Utterly Divine Divinations to I Ching, You Ching, We All Ching to Atlantis on $5 a Day & so much more!Remember, this is humor & Hester Mundis is quite serious about her humor! She's given us a healthy dose of hilarity, good for a 101 laughs at ourselves, our expectations & the crazy way we scurry around hoping to find heaven before we get there!"
4,very satisfied,although it seemed that the dvd's are new; came in the package sealed; the 3rd disk had a scratch and so did the fourth disk; which cause a small skip in 2 scenes.overall i am very satisfied.thank you
4,Season 3,"I am so addicted to this show - I can't wait for the third season to be released. I know, 2nd season only came out last week, but I cannot wait. Someone, please tell me when!!!!!!"
3,Nip tuck dvd series two,This set was marketed as a new product. When I received it I found out that it had been used.
2,sesshomaru,i love it and i make sure to ck on cosplay to match it then i can make sew clothes for anime expo at las vegas for every years (annual).. always i feel great expience in my heart to see many people wear cosplay of anime fan.. something like that.. and also .. i did noticed some people wear cosplay from inuyasha and sesshomaru.. i feel love it !!.. but it is fun and sometime hard to time to do sew clothes to match of cosplay what you like ? ..umm i make play with sesshomaru 8 flush .. i feel keep me feel better to play with it .. smile .. thanks..
3,Not a good fit in size,I doubt this case is specifically built for Nokia E62 because it is a little smaller than it should be to cover the handset body.
5,My 5 year old son loves this book!,"I bought this through a school book club and there were no reviews then, but purchased it anyway and am glad I did! My almost 6-year-old son *loves* this book. He reads it to me every night at bedtime. The sentences are short and easy, with only a few long words (i.e., ""amazing"" and ""adventure""), and the pictures are gorgeous -- right from the movie. As a picture reader, this book has icons for Curious George, the yellow hat, etc (about 16 total). My son even enjoys reading through the list of icons at the beginning of the book, and was tickled to see that those words are in alphabetical order. We have only had it a few weeks and it's dog eared already because he reads it so often! We recommend this book for anyone who enjoyed the Curious George movie."
4,Good watch for soccer - nice vibrate option,Overall I like this watch - I use it for all levels of soccer games. The vibrate option and ability to set match lengths are very nice. Dual timer allows you to work out any additional extra time. Only complaint is the buttons feel a little cheap but overall I'm very happy with this watch - it also has some other useful features to me like dual world time.
4,Wheels and Looms,"In conjunction with other books of a similar topic, I found this book to be very informative. The projects contained in this book are challenging and consequently would definately task a persons woodworking capabilities.Excellent buy."
4,Alright but not much different than Livin' Large,"Well it was alright but there really isn't that much different that livin' large. You can have a 'House Party' with all you friends but this expansion just wasnt as great as I thought it would be. If you have to choose between livin' large or this game, I would choose livin' large."
5,Good Game Bad money,"this game was really good. i liked it a lot but unless you have a reasonable amount of space in your hard drive the game can get really slow and it takes 2 (real world) minutes to make your sim take 1 step. But ignoring that its a really good game but if you don't have livin' large already i would get that first (thats one mistake i made). I like the new objects like the bull and campfire but the cost is really irritating. I mean its just a expansion pack! But otherwise its a must buy , after you buy the original sims and livin' large ..."
4,same old thing,"I thought that this EP would have more to but... You must have this expantion pack(not literly but you should) have this for hot date. Without hot date though I do not suggest paying 29.99. However there is one reson I bought this game. Lots of people had problems with livin large, well this game patches all the problems missing objects and every thing so if you have livin large and it does not work I highly sugest this game"
3,Not as Good as 'Livin Large',"This addon pack is mostly a filler-in. There is little substance to it. Offered is the option to hold a party, with caterers and dance floor. Neighbors will then come over alot easier than before. Too bad parties arent fun, and mostly a mess. There are alot of new items but nothing better than what you find on 7DS or some other fan sites. Other items like the costume trunk actually get annoying messing up body files. The DJ table doesnt let you chooose tracks or do much of anything. The Sims titles contain drinking, sexual situations, and adult overtones but its a family game, go figure.For fans, its too bad its a full-price addon. It shouldnt be for its lack of content or originality. Its half the addon as Livin Large was, and probably 1/10th of the upcoming Hot Date. But you will break down and buy it just cause The Sims is that good of a game to warrant these cash-cow ins."
2,Disapointed,I bought this game a while back and for me It hardly had any appeal afterwords. There are no new careers just new objects which is really dissapointing because the real draw is ;what are they gonna be promoted to? When they dont add onto that aspect it has very little appeal.
2,Not for students about to take the boards!!,"This book is informative and organized but I dont think it's very useful if you're studying for the boards. The answers are on the same page right next to the questions so it's hard to quiz yourself, most of the questions involve PET which most board questions aren't, and the boards aren't organized questions."
2,several typos and incorrect answers,"I used this book as I was studying for my nuclear radiology CAQ. Some of the PET questions are outdated, and I found a few typos and wrong answers to be pretty distracting. It gives a good superficial review of various topics and gave me a good reason to review the topics in a text book, but I wouldn't recommend it for those who are not already pretty familiar with nuclear radiology."
4,Enjoyable.,"Annabeth Gish is great in any film. Jon Cryer does a decent job, and the story line is okay. The ending is a bit melodramatic, but worth watching. Watch this movie on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Then watch MYSTIC PIZZA later that night. Did I mention Annabeth Gish?"
5,Great Movie,I'm just browsing through older movies to see what I could find from the past that I forgot about. This one blew my mind. I remember it. Definitely a classic movie in my opinion. I'm gonna watch again.
4,A trip down memory lane,"Jon Cryer himself trips to the past as he triest to blend in back in high school. After some Mis-adventures, he saves the day and recreates a future winning respect and love !"
1,Worthless,"This headphone is not even worth your time. I brought two because I wanted to give a pair to my son and it was horrible. It sound like just like its price...cheap. The bass is really bad and if you want the bass to be better then you literally have to press the headphone close to your ears with your hands... and keep them there! Don't buy, anything else it better than this thing."
3,"Good deal from Amazon, product a bit different","These are a good deal in that the cost is less than four dollars presently from Amazon and come with an extra set of foam ear cushions - a really good deal! Odd things though about these are that 1) the fit is tight and exerts noticeable pressure on ears - great for winter when you really want that ear muff function, but a bit too tight otherwise, (might be good for children), and 2) in my set for my ears the sound seems somewhat muffled and bass oriented compared with other sets I've used. Update: the cost in July 2008 is now more than nine dollars but I want to report that these have held up well, am still on the first of the two sets of foam ear cushions and the connector plug, often a weak point in headsets, has proven strong. The clamping effect I noticed at first has lessened and the headset is not too tight after wearing them nearly every day for four months. Really a tough headset."
4,"Not bad, but don't last.","I bought two of these for a cross country trip. The kids loved wearing them and we loved the silence! However, one of the headphones quit working in one ear after 4 days. Guess you get what you pay for. Thankfully I had a back up pair."
3,"good price ,fast shipping positivie except",over all positive the right side of the headphones don't work but I can live with it
2,This is a case of get what you pay for.,These are inexpensive and sound like it. I knew what I would get when I placed the order. I got what I paid for. Not angry. not disappointed. I have had many KOSS products since I bought my Pro4AAs in 1975. I own several pair now and will continue to buy KOSS. I guess these are good if you listen to books on tape or something.
5,Koss Rules!,"I purchased two sets of headphones. One is a Sony and the other is a Koss, of the two I think that Koss is the better value, they provide an extra pairs of ear cushions which need replacement after about a years use."
2,Disappointing,"I was severely disappointed with the quality of this product. Whilst they worked these headphones were serviceable enough- sound quality was iffy, especially with rock or music that contained a heavy bass beat to it. At loud volumes an annoying buzzing sound could be heard in the background; just loud enough to be distracting. Also, the volume levels were poor, could not go nearly loud enough. So long as I had working headphones however, I was willing to ignore these problems.The real problems started after about two weeks of use. Completely unexpectedly, sound started to play only in one ear, then would switch back and forth at nearly every other syllable. This made the music almost impossible to decipher, no less enjoy! Sometimes the sound would even go quiet for several minutes, before switching back to working in only one ear. I do not intend to buy another electronic product with this brand name again, these were so disappointing!"
3,FOUR FOOT CORD is too short for many applications,"If you can live with a 4 foot long cord, these are inexpensive and reasonable. But you want to connect to a PC sitting on the floor, find something with a longer cord."
4,Pretty amazing,"I was reserved when buying these. I saw their low price and was nervous to throw out money for low-grade headphones. However, this was not the case. The shipment arrived on-time, a day early actually, the packaging was strong and when I plugged them in, I was surprised. I'm a basshead and always have my equalizer set to Full Bass on my Mp3 player. The bass on these headphones was brilliant and completely blew me away. They were the cheapest headphones I ever bought (price-wise), but the best headphones I ever had. I'm actually buying another pair. The reason why I 4-starred the comfort was because when you wear them for more that three hours, your ears feel a bit squished and they look red as a cherry. But all in all, a beautiful product both price and sound-wise and I recommend them to anyone, including bassheads like me."
5,Once I had a dream...and this is it,"Never before have I heard such beautiful music. Never before have I seen a better DVD production than this. Folks, this is the real stuff!If you love Nightwish as much as I do, this is worth every penny of the investment. I watch this concert one or two times per week still. I guess I'm addicted.Knowing that Tarja is gone sadens my heart, but I'll have this to remember the chemistry forever."
2,Ok,The book help provide some ideas to help my child but I thought it would also put ideas of more things to worry about so I screened the book first before reviewing only certain pages with my child
5,A great resource for parents and kids!,"As a parent I found this book to be a wonderful resource and tool. It's hands-on, workbook style approach is excellent. Parents come away with a set of tools and strategies on how best to help their children overcome their anxieties. Children, in a comfortable and 'fun' format, can explore different ways to understand and manage their 'worries'. The writing style and illustrations compliment each other and can easily be understood by young children through pre-teen. While written by a clinical psychologist I didn't come away feeling intimidated. Dr. Huebner has done a wonderful job encouraging parent and child to work together to overcome the issues around anxiety in a way that is fun and empowering."
5,Wonderful book!,"This book simplifies the feelings that we all face and puts them into words. The illustrations and activities are wonderful for elementary-age children. I read this book with my daughter (age 7) and she immediately stated that it sounded a lot like her! It almost does feel as if it was written for her. I am now going to read it to my class of 6th graders with special needs.I also have the book about ""grumbles"" by the same author and it too is amazing."
2,"The Pale Horse, An Even Paler Plot","I put THE PALE HORSE in the same group I place Agatha Christies' espionage & spy books--the bottom of the list. In THE PALE HORSE she dredges up pseudo-science and dubious folklore & mixes it all up in very hazy motivations. It's like once she gets off the right track she just forges ahead with even more malarkey. I love her, but this is just silly & preposterous to me. I apologize to other fans, but this story is very forgettable. I donnit remember whodunnit, because I donnit care whodunnit."
4,So Who Murdered Lady Hesketh-Dubois?,"I've been on an Agatha Christie murder spree lately, reading some of her books for the first time and some which are old friends. The Pale Horse was new to me. I found the witchcraft scenes a little unsettling and was relieved when the witches turned out to be window dressing for old-fashioned murder. But I was looking forward to finding out who killed Lady Hesketh-Dubois, Mark's godmother. Apparently she died of thallium poisoning, and her name was on the murder list. But once the mastermind of the murder-for-hire scheme was revealed, that was it. I was disappointed not to learn who killed Lady Hesketh-Dubois. Was this thread just dropped, or did I miss something?"
5,Son's favorite shoe,"Beautiful shoe, fits perfectly. This pair is replacing a well loved pair of brown Sperry Topsiders. The black/burgundy trim is just a bit dressier and perfect for heading off to college."
1,Sahara AO,"I have owned several pairs of the AO Sahara. This pair is much, much lighter in color than past purchases. I am not sure why it is not even close in color to others I have owned and those seen in stores."
3,Not as good as Rockports,"This is an exceptionally good looking shoe, however, the sole is not as thick as the Rockports my son has enjoyed in the past and says he can feel the rocks pushing up through the sole where he didn't feel that in the Rockports.Thought we'd give these a try and again they are gorgeous, but we'll be going back to the Rockports after this.Seller was very fast and there is no way to compare these to anything else unless you've owned both. We'd buy from this seller again."
5,Great deal,And I didn't have to go out to get them! Hard to find size 13 available in most styles. Thanks!
5,Classic style,"I ordered these mostly for a vacation to the Caribbean, I wanted something equally at home on the beach and walking around town. They were perfect. In fact, they have replaced my regular shoes back home. They are starting to break-in, and I can tell they will just get more comfy with age."
3,OK - There are better titles,"This book is OK but not special. If you are a student of selling and prospecting is a big part of your job it is a decent addition to your library but something less than a must have title. If you own it you may find a nugget or two that will help you.The best book on getting heard on a favorable basis high up the food chain in B2B sales is: ""Value Forward Selling.""That being said this book will have some value for you."
5,This is a must read for everyone.,This book is interesting and provides you with a knowledge of correct things that should be inplemented into your daily life and diet. I found this book to be a easy read. Once I started to read this book I could not put it down and I told numerous friends about it.
2,Too negative,"I found the book had a tendency to run ""on and on"" in regards to certain subjects, such as aspartame, etc. After the point was made, the author continued to ramble on the subject, to the point where I found myself wanting to skip to the next area, so to speak (in fact I did so at times). I also was beginning to believe that the author is of the opinion that ""everything"" will give you cancer. I found myself saying ""take what you need and leave the rest."" Also, when I realized that the book was published almost 10 years ago, I have to question the validity of some of the points made. Things change in ten years."
5,Try it-It Works !!,"After seeing Dr. Broer on tv I ordered the book. Within days of putting his advice into practice, the weight began to drop. For all those who are sick and tired of feeling sick and tired, I recommend this book. It is easy, even fun to read and full of info most of us don't know about the foods we eat.And don't worry, you won't have to give up *everything*."
2,A little less than objective,"The constant religious overtones and several obvious logical fallacies cause me to question the objectivity of the author and his ability to synthesize the cited research. The text is oversimplified, which takes credibilty away from his conclusions. Unfortunately, I will have to search for a better source of nutritional advice."
3,"Great toy, but unhappy with Seller, Farm Goods for Kids","The company that sells this item, Farm Goods For Kids, does not offer good customer service. This item was a gift from someone, and unfortunately we already own it. Farm Good For Kids offers NO exchange program and only offers refunds. ""Unfortunately we are not set up for exchanges."" What kind of company does not allow exchanges?? I won't be recommending their store nor ordering anything from them in the future."
3,a real thriller,"A beautiful blond female cop investigates a string of murders, all blond victims. Interesting plot twists, keeps you guessing to the end. A fair number of nude scenes, for the guys. Light entertainment."
2,Typical Shannon Tweed film.,"Worth a late night watch on CineMax. I only bought this DVD because I am in the film. But if you are a fan of Shannon's, you will not be disappointed."
3,Not Jewish Enough for Me,Was expecting something a little more Jewish and insightful from this book. I could have written this book in a few hours; with all the Jewish commentaties out there (Rashi) the book could have been deeper.
2,Not so good,"It is not a pin ball simulator, more a strange and fairly original game with a ball and flippers. I never enjoyed it, however."
5,Great product,"i am still using it everyday, great quality, comfortable, worth the money, love it.i recommend this to every one"
4,drop city shines,"T.C.Boyle writes beautifully, you actually believe you are in the story, the characters are real and their personalities shine through involving you in the lives and adventures. Tortilla Curtain probably the best book I have ever read and Drop City is written in the same vain showing the interaction between vastly different people, but pitting them against natures different elements and the effects it has on the characters, recommended to people who enjoy excellent contempory fiction.4 Stars as I loved it but did not impact on me as much as Tortilla Curtain."
3,The Virtue of Lifestyles?,"I'm very much in agreement with ""vitaminj's"" review from earlier this year. I'm appreciative of Boyle's talent and the deft drawing of his characters. I simply wasn't overly impressed with this particular story.I do appreciate, however, the restraint Boyle used in keeping easy moral judgments at bay and his ability to resist a certain tidiness. Early in the novel, he alternately featured the hippies of Drop City with Sess Harder and the folk of the Alaskan frontier. I imagined a predictable outcome of this contrast in which the two groups would square off in a battle of lifestyle wills. Instead, the melding and merging that occured emphasized commonalities that made it seem as though the two camps were so different, they were virtually the same."
4,A Reactionary Tale,"This novel was very engaging and accurate in it's depiction of the drug-addled and heady days of the 70's. The citizens of Drop City South were idealistic, naive and most of all irresponsible. Their move from California to Alaska seemed logical in the plot and ludicrous at the same time. The ability of Boyle to juxtapose these idealists with the realism of life in Alaska by real environmentalists and survivors of the Alaskan life was brilliant. By the end of the book you realize that it has levied a scathing criticism of the idealistic hippies. I found the ending disappointing and anti-climactic; but the characters were endearing and multidimensional. It was a good read and I would recommend to those looking for a glimpse into the counterculture of the 70's as well as the life of Alasakan settlers."
2,Disappointing,"If you're interested in life on the Yukon in the 1970s, read ""Coming Into the Country."" If you are interested in hippies and communes, read something by Joan Didion or Tom Wolfe. Just don't read this book, where you will be forced to spend an awful lot of time with some pretty unsympathetic and uninteresting characters without picking up much insight along the way. T.C. Boyle does craft a shockingly original (to me) way of killing off one of his characters."
2,I'll Pass on This Trip Down Memory Lane,"I can see where this book might entertain readers who tuned in and dropped out in the 60s. I was a little old for the Haight Ashbury experience. The book had no appeal for me. Even though it's received good reviews, I found the writing puerile, with clichés strung together like cranberries and popcorn. Here's a passage chosen at random:""And two minutes later he was in the back house and there were six or seven cats sitting around listening to Marvin Gaye out of a battery-powered portable stereo with a blown bass, thump, thump, blat, thump, thump, blat. Sky Dog was there, cradling his guitar, somebody had lit a couple of scented candles because there was no electricity in the back house, and there was a new girl there--a chick--and she couldn't have been more than fourteen or fifteen. A runaway. What was her name? Sally. Where was she from? Santa Clara. And what was her father like? He was a son of a bitch.""The writing was embarrassing and made my toes curl."
3,Not his best work,"I'm a huge T.C. Boyle fan - loved The Road To Wellville and consider him to be one of the best short-story writers in the business. But I was rather disappointed with Drop City. It's not a bad book, but it falls short of what every fan knows to be Boyle's true potential. The premise and plot are promising. A group of hippies is forced off their California commune and naively journeys north to Alaska to live off the land. There they encounter a group of locals who are well-accustomed to the harsh winters and rugged living, and not at all eager to have new neighbors. It's a good recipe to start from, and the characters are well-drawn and quirky in a way that is distinctly Boyle. But the writing itself is lame. It's as if Boyle dumbed it down to appeal to a lower common denominator of readers. Or maybe he just didn't try as hard with this one. In any event, the result is a book that is good pop fiction but not really literature, and that's disappointing for a writer of his stature."
4,Not too shabby. . .,"The biggest thing that prevents this record form getting a 5 star rating is without a doubt the track Fire Dance, which I guess is supposed to be like reggae hokey-pokey, and its terrible! A BOBO doing a song like that is just so unexcusable. That being said, there is no other weak track on the record, (while I can't say that I like the song Good Life, its still a decent cut.) My favorite song here is without a doubt Black Coffee, where Anthony B, does absolutely nothing but bigup the black woman, its easily his best song, besides Fire Pon Rome of course. I also like All God's Children, Rally Round and I Will Never Bow Down with the brilliant Stephen Marley. Overall, like I said, minus Fire Dance its a very good record. Listen to it on a portable cd player or on a remote controlled stereo system, so you won't have to get up to skip track # 6. Good stuff."
5,Nice!,The West Virginia Cookie Cutter is exactly what I was looking for to make special-occasion treats for my friends and co-workers.
5,Sticky Bandit Approved,"Home Alone 1 & 2 are staples in my house at Christmas and last year when I wanted to watch them I remembered that we only had them on VHS... After going to at least 6 different movie rentals or target or best buy, etc. on Christmas Eve, I was unable to find either movie anywhere. This year I got smarter and thought I would be prepared from now on. I was so happy when I found Home Alone on Amazon and even happier when I realized it was a blueray box set of the best in the series for such low price! this was definitely the best pre-Christmas gift I got myself and my family. Keep the change you filthy Animal."
2,not worth it for blu-ray,"LOVE THESE MOVIES, don't get me wrong. But, the HD blu-rays i received were not up to par. the quality just wasn't there, maybe it was just a bad set?! Interior scenes showed a high amount of noise that was worse then some DVD's I have. These are being returned and will be getting the dvds, save your money and do the same!"
5,LOVE IT,ME AND MY FAMILY WATCH THIS MOVIE YEAR ROUND. MY DAUGHTER LOVES TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND WATCH THIS MOVIE.
5,HOME ALONE,HOME ALONE COLLECTION in BLU-RAY is a must have. If you want to laugh this is the collection to have.
4,Great Value,"I purchased this for a great price, less than $12. I thought when it said ""collection"" it would be all 3 movies but it is only the first 2, which is fine because the 3rd one was really no good. It still is less than $6 per movie which is great for a blu ray classic.i recommend this set!"
5,One of John Hughes top tens!,"There is not much to say about these two movies that has not been said a million times. John Hughes has us laughing till our side's hurt in the 80's and the 90's and this one is no exception. Unlike most other ""lie rays"" the digital conversion of these two films was top notch and went well beyond just simple video noise reduction and the restored to 5.1 original soundtrack will blow you out of you seat! A must have for any video collection as it will entertain the young and the old."
3,Fluffy Holiday Mayhem With a Warm Heart,"When the action hits its climax, this treads a dangerous line between cartoon violence and the real thing, but a powerful dose of John Hughes sentimentality and a side of Christmas spirit mostly smooth things over. Macaulay Culkin's acting in the lead is utterly unbearable for anyone over the age of ten, and the cache of gimmicks and booby traps that fuel his story often asks far too much of the audience. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern make up for that as a duo of over-amplified burglar stereotypes, played with a wink and a nudge at just the right moments, and Catherine O'Hara shines in a rare straight role as the flustered mother an ocean away from her youngest child. Straightforward and light for the majority of its run time, the film works best when it remembers to pluck the heartstrings with a few season-specific character moments and subplots."
5,Loved the collection as a kid and still do.,"Bought this during Black Deals week for an awesome price, even better on Blu Ray. Who couldn't have these for the holidays?"
4,Excellent!,"My one and only complaint is that I feel too much of the time on the cd is wasted by playing the theme music and repeating what amounts to a commercial for the authors and producers of the story. It sounds as if if were broadcast on the radio as a serial where it would be logical to begin and end each broadcast with music and an introduction and then close with a wrap up of the same information, but it is not necessary and in fact is annoying in the cd format. That should have been edited to appear only at the beginning and end of each disk, not each 'episode' which makes me feel I am paying for listening time that I am not getting. But the story and acting are good and I am looking forward to purchasing sequential cd's in the story."
5,The best of Monty Python!,"Monty Python Live at City CenterHere in one CD are MOST of Monty Python's skits. They have done so much funny stuff over the years, that they would hard pressed to include all of everyones favorite skits but it is an excellent compromise. (One of my favorites, ""the techniques of pie throwing class"" wasn't there but that grist for another CD). I loved the CD and definitely got my moneys worth and I an willing to bet that if you are too. You will enjoy this album."
4,Classic Christmas,A old story done right. While this title has many remakes this one is one of the best.
1,Stay Away From Soleus,"First unit was dead on arrival. Amazon quickly exchanged. Second unit worked okay for one season then died. Customer service kept telling that the units last a long time but only a one year warranty. Stay away from the brand, failure rate seems high. Poor customer support."
1,Impossible to use,"It is very quiet and very efficient, but it is next to impossible to use it in a continuous drainage pattern. The hose is not included and all the explanations of the Technical support don't make any sense. They told me to buy a ""surgical tubing"", that no one in the hardware store has any idea about, then gave me the wrong size of the tubing and would not clearly explain how it connect it. The bucket is tiny and it is not easy to take out, so without a constant draining it is useless. Waist of money!"
2,Worked great for 18 months,Liked this dehumidifier for compact footprint and quiet operation. Also appreciated the ability to connect a drain hose that was high enough to drain into a condensate pump without putting the unit on a pedestal. After 18 months the unit stopped working. The fan still blows and you can hear the compressor turn on but it is not producing condensate even in high humidity.
2,Great...for awhile,"I purchased my first unit about three years ago. It's whisper quiet performance was probably the biggest draw. Temps down to 50 degrees seemed to cause no problems. Unfortunately it began leaking coolant at 13 months, just past the warranty date.With some hesitation, I purchased a second unit. This time, the compressor/coolant issue occurred at about 7 months of use. Small appliance stores won't bother with repair of dehumidifiers. Even with the warranty, cost of shipping back to the company just didn't make sense.Bottom line, if it works, it works great. But the durability of this unit and some difficulty reaching the company to address such issues will keep me from purchasing Soleus again."
4,Soleus Air CFM-40,I've got it only about a month so I can't speak for longevity. So far it works very well. It's very quiet indead. My only problem was that the 50% humidity setting is 5% off (to 45%). I wanted really 50% and I wrote an email to tha factory support. Unfortunately their server rejected my message (I guess they set it so they receive less email load). Although their products seem very desirable and not noisy I wouldn't buy another unit in the future due to seemingfull lack of support.
1,Compressor died between seasons,"This little dehumidifier worked beautifully for two and a half seasons. This spring when the heat was finally no longer necessary, and the rains began, the basement started to dampen up a bit and I flipped on the dehumidifier. After it chugged away for a few days and the water collection bin remained completely empty and my basement got that familiar musty smell, I realized with sadness that I was one of the unhappy losers whose compressor failed for no reason after just two and a half seasons. I am back to purchase another dehumidifier, and this time I will try the frigidare. I hope Soleus addresses this issue with the failing compressors, because while it worked, it was a fantastic little machine."
5,Sucks all moisture out of the air to make living space nice and dry!,"My apartment had a moisture problem; whenever it rained, my apartment seemed damp, and whenever anybody showered, the towels stayed wet for days. Soon, our closets were damp and we had to throw out many precious belongings that we couldn't salvage. I bought this dehumidifier in January, and our apartment has been blissfully dry since. We leave it running on all the time for maximum dryness, and we dump buckets of water each day. It works very well, and sucks all moisture out of the air, making our apartment much warmer and livable. It is also very quiet, not loud like an air conditioner like I thought it would be. I hardly notice the hmm that it makes while it's on. I highly recommend this dehumidifier!"
1,Never worked right,"Very quiet? Yes indeed! Does it pull moisture from the air? Yep. Like crazy! However, after about one month of use I noticed that the compressor works only at the highest ""Dry"" setting, and it never shuts down. I used a watt/amp-meter since it is difficult to tell if the compressor is on or off just by sound.It cost me $38 to ship the unit back for replacement and they only replace it with a refurbished one. This is grossly unfair for a product that never worked right. I am very certain that some of the satisfied users have the same problem but unaware of it."
5,Does what its suppose to and very quiet!,"I've only had this for a few months but it works very well and is very quiet. No complaints at all so far, I would have no problems recommending this to a friend."
1,"Might work for a year, IF you're lucky","We bought a 40-pt Soleus for our basement in Sept 2007 and it worked great until a few days ago. We got about 8 mos. of use out of it and now it quit and is leaking refrigerant. We're SOL because Soleus has only a 1-yr warranty.Even worse, we bought a 25-pt Soleus about a month ago and it did not collect a drop of water. Paid $45 to ship it back and we received a new one within 2 wks, but it does not collect 25 pts a day--more like 5 pints. Avoid this product. I decided we'll get a Frigidaire with a 5-yr warranty on the compressor."
2,Junk......,Two units that did not work.... I have one that does. Let's see how it lasts....... It coswt me $40 to mail it back to Soleus.....
1,DOA,Unit turned on but would not remove any water from the air in a very moist area. It was run for 10 hours and did not produce a drop of water.
1,Didn't last long,"This died after two years. I have another that we've used for at least 15 years. That's still going. When it worked, it was great. I would have given it a great review. However, longevity is equally important to me. I won't get another one."
1,0 for 2. Have received second and doesn't work. Bad support.,"The support queue is straight out of the eighties. Press the number for consumer support, and you hear ""you have reached the dealer support and returns department"" in a scratchy tape recording. Then it says you are reaching the returns/RMA department. Then you hear 80s jazz music and every 10 seconds you hear ""thanks for continuing to hold"". Then when the phone rings, you just get put back into the queue. Then once they say it should be replaced, they ask for your invoice. Upon receiving it, they start playing phone tag with you. Then you have to go to Amazon, which has fantastic customer support. The website and manual are very basic. Bad, no---very bad experience. Do not recommend."
5,Good Product - Buy Out of Season for Best Price,Working well so far.I bought this in March when the price was $135. I would suggest that you wait - if possible - and buy out of season as the prices have been raised significantly in the summer months.
1,ONE STAR!!!! THEY WON'T LET ME CHANGE THE STAR RATING!,"Marvelous engineering. Whisperquiet. Has only one flaw, a big sticker in front which does not come off like it should and leaves gunk on the device. Why do manufacturers do this?Follow-up: After about a year, it kept on running but did not produce any water at all. Not worth repairing.Final score:4 units ( one arrived dead and was replaced by Amazon), two dead weeks after termination of warranty. Made in China (where else?)."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Soleus will not support this product! If it fails to work, Soleus recommends dumping it in a landfill! They do not provide a list of service providers, they do not supply parts, they have no service manuals. The Soleus website proudly displays an ""eco-freindly"" sticker on it's homepage. They should be ashamed to create products this resource intensive that are thrown away when they fail."
2,Worked till it failed after warranty had expired,I had the unit in my day light basement and it saw occasional action from time to time. On the plus side it is a quiet unit and it worked till it failed. On the downside the unit failed a month after its warranty had expired. Given the usage rate I was expecting a much longer life cycle. I attempted to contact the company but no response thus far. For my next unit I'll probably go with a Kenmore unit from my local Sears store. I may have better luck with them when that unit breaks down.
4,great dehumidfier,"This dehumidifier is just what we needed. We have an older home with a dampness, mold and mildew problem. This really took out so much moisture and helped our house be healthier. The only problem was that when it is filled to the top it does overflow and is difficult to empty. We liked the quietness of it so that it could be in our living space."
5,quiet dehumidifier,so far so good. using dehumidifier in garage/basement. it is quiet and seems to keep the air moving and humidity down.
1,"Cheap, flimsy, poorly designed!","This was the worst dehumidifier we have every purchased. Unless it was on the ""maximum"" setting, no water was removed from our humid laundry room, even though the compressor on the unit would run. In addition, the bucket to empty the dehumidifer was very poorly designed, causing water to slop onto the floor every time it was removed. The design of the bucket also made it nearly impossible to poor the water out neatly, without spilling everywhere. Finally, after 8 months of use, the flimsy piece of metal, used to detect when the bucket is full, broke off when we removed the bucket, rendering the entire unit worthless. Without the flimsy metal piece, the device registers that the bucket is always full, and the unit will not run. Will never purchase a dehumidifier - or any other product - from this company again!"
5,Works Efficiently and Quietly,We've used this non-stop in a very damp area for over a year. It draws a respectable amount of moisture from the air and is so quiet that I have to check it periodically to be sure it's running. We've had other brands that are so noisy they weren't worth running!
1,piece of junk,"All Soleus junk is just that- JUNK. Mine lasted 5 months, and the next summer it wouldn't pull any moisture. Called Soleus and was told too bad, the warranty is up.. They have no repair people in the U.S., they don't repair them themselves, and won't sell you a part if you could fiqure out what is wrong with it. All they do is import them from China and cash your check. Buy American."
1,Great reviews - WARNING: Will Last Only 2 Years!,"Like you I read a million reviews on dehumidifiers and Soleus seemed like a great choice. It worked well for 2 years, then started freezing up and is now shot... Very disappointed that a simple product can't last for more than 2 years!! The search continues...."
2,Worked well as long as it was powered up,"I purchased the Soleus CFM40E to dehumidify our basement. It was a mid-range unit out of the three that were on display at our local national chain. After a year and a half of nearly continuous use (dehumidification set to mid-level 'two drops'), I powered it off so it wouldn't need to run while my family was away for a week. Once we came back, I powered it up. The compressor was VERY loud and the compressor shut itself off after several seconds. I powered it back on again and it was fairly quiet - a slight hum coming from the compressor area - but it also shut the compressor off after a few seconds. It will no longer dehumidify, although the fan still runs and it acts as if it is working.Perhaps I shouldn't have powered it off!Soleusair only warrants this unit for one year. I've replaced it with a different name-brand dehumidifier with a five year compressor warranty."
4,Very quiet dehumidifier - decent power,"This product did not disappoint as far as the noise level. It is truly much quieter than my LG, however it doesn't seem to pull as much water out of the air as the other. The LG also offers a digital setting for humidity control, where the Soleus only has dry, medium or moist settings. The ""dry"" setting keeps the humidity in my basement level rooms under 50% but lower if it is dry outside.Anyway, I recommend it if you are not looking for a heavy duty dehumidifier. I think the fact that it is so quiet seals the deal on my recommendation."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"THIS WAS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: We are so pleased with this dehumidifier. We needed one to take down the humidity in our living area of our home that does not have a basement or crawl space. It has done an excellent job of taking down the humidity. It looks nice, can not even tell what it is. It has quiet operation (doesn't disturb TV watching or talking in the same room). It has a sizable bin for the water to collect but I am sure one would want the larger size unit if using in a basement. It is very easy to empty with no spill over and we feel very comfortable with the automatic shut off when it is full. It was packaged very well and delivered very quickly and the price from Amazon was a savings compared to other stores.I AM NOW CHANGING MY REVIEW!!! WE HAD PURCHASED TWO OF THESE AND AFTER ONE YEAR BOTH OF THEM WOULD NO LONGER DRAW MOISTURE OUT OF THE AIR. WHEN I CALLED THE COMPANY THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING (NO REPAIR) THAT COULD BE DONE. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
1,Both units purchased died within two years..dont buy,"I purchased one of these from amazon a few years ago to dry out my basement which gets musty from time to time,and it died just after one year of use.(It kept running,but did not collect water).I puchased another unit,again from amazon to replace the broken one,and the new one died in two years (exact same issue as the first).I paid about $200 for each unit,and I feel there are definitely better options out there that work after 2 years!I will need a new one,and I will NOT be purchasing a Soleus!"
1,Dehumidifier worked for 1 month then broke,"I purchased this dehumidifier because it got great reviews. I started using it and it worked well. However there seems to be no shut off when the air reaches a certain % of humidity. There is high, low or off. So you have to remember to turn it off or it will keep running until the bucket becomes full. About a month after using it, it stopped working. I called amazon but too much time had passed to return it, so I am going to try to use the companies warrenty to get replacement parts. I would suggest either getting a different dehumidifer or beware of this problem, and return it before the amazon warrenty runs out."
4,Removes Moisture Quickly,"This is a great product - had it about a month. Our windows would be soaked every morning, needing to be towel dried. From the first night we used this, windows have been either dry or have had just a little condensation. Removes moisture really well. The only negative (and reason for not giving 5 stars) is that it isn't quite as portable as I had expected -- it has casters, not wheels, which work well on hardwood flrs, but are totally ineffective on any type of carpeting. I find it awkward to lift and carry over carpeted rooms, and then drag over hardwd flrs. We need a second one and were considering the 25pt one thinking it would be lighter/smaller, but it is only about 3 lbs lighter, is the exact same dimensions, and costs only $8-$10 less! So, think we'll be buying another 40pt before the rainy spring begins. Hoping our unit doesn't meet the premature death that some posters have encountered."
3,life span < 2 years??,"i purchased this model with the extended warranty. for 1.5 years it worked great at removing humidity from a 1200 sq ft apartment. then the thing started icing over completely, despite the air temp being about 67F-71F.i contacted the warranty people and had to fight with them for nearly 2 months. long story short, it was only after i involved the BBB that they refunded my full purchase price because they couldn't find a supplier to replace it cheaply. neither could they find an appliance shop willing to work on it for anything less than a charge that costs as much as a new machine.when i was a kid, we had a kenmore that lasted nearly 10 years and was built like a tank. it is sad that today's appliances are made to crap out in less than 2 years, to be thrown away. then again, what do you expect when everything these days is coming from china, and everyone's customer support center is run out of pakistan or india?"
4,Great Product,"The Soleus CFM-40 great little product. It's quiet, efficient, and user friendly. I love having the optional drain port - which I have hooked to 1/2 inch cpvc running into a drain in my basement. My basement is very moist (filled up the pan in about 5 hours before hooking up the auto-drain,) and there is a constant drip from the drain setup.The only negative I have is that the CFM-40 does not reset after a power outage or after unplugging it. You must manually reset it in order for it to get it going again. It does lose 1 star for that reason."
5,Quiet dehumidifier,The dehumidifier is very quiet; we keep it on all the time in the basement and guests can stay down there in the summer.
1,If you want to waste your money buy this ...,"I dont want to given even 1 star, since there is no ZERO stars i had to give 1..i bought this product based on the reviews at amazon and also i relied on the products from amazon, but this is a big disappointment for me, the product just died after 1 year"
5,Silent Grief: Living in the Wake of Suicide/,"My son committed suicide. It's very hard to accept. This book has a lot of wisdom. Suicide in such a deliberate act...as a mother it has made me question my entire life. The ""why's"" are never-ending. I highly recommend this book."
1,not original product,This was one of two seasons that I received that are not the original One Tree Hill sets. The cases were not the same as the other seasons and the dvd's did not start at the beginning of the episode. They did not have the opening and closing credits and they did not have the opening and closing songs. It seems to me that these are copies of the originals. I have all the other seasons and the two that I received are not at all the same as the others that I purchased at a store. I can no longer trust ordering dvd's in this way.
5,Greatest Show on regular tv,"I 've been hooked on this show since the beginning and I can't wait for season 5, it starts January 8th. 2 hour premier."
2,Missing DVD,"I ordered this item as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she was really happy when she opened it until we found out that one disk was missing. It was a series of 6 DVD's and the number 6 DVD was missing. In its place was season 2, disk one. If there is anyway to get the correct disk, I would be happy to return the wrong one. Thanks for your time."
1,Troy-Bilt Tiller,"We ordered this product back towards the 1st part of July. After several phone calls it finally arrived the 1st part of August. The add said it would ship within 3 days. When I uncrated the product I found the air filter housing had been broken, the choke lever was in the bottom of the crate. I tried piecing it back together and finally called Polsteins Home & Beyond. I was told that they needed to talk with their manager and would try to ship a replacement part to me. I waited and never heard back. I tried calling again but was put on hold for over 15 minutes then the phone call dropped. I sent an e-mail. I heard back within a day that they reviewed my complaint and would send me the information via e-mail with instructions on how to return the tiller. It has been two days and I still have not received anything from them. So if you are asking if we are satisfyed...no by a long shot."
2,Poor,I wasn't very happy with this book. It was written all over in it. As well as the writing it had post-it notes all over throughout it
3,Well....,"The [...] but I believe that we have the monolpoly on music. This album is not bad, the band is not bad but they are only OK. Not bad, but nothing too great. If you want good music, check out AFI - The Art of Drowning or Thursday - Full Collapse. Those CD's have better screaming than anything on the market. TRUST ME. I listen to more music than anyone here. My band has toured with some of the best bands there are (including AFI). SO listen to me on this one. UK music isn't oo big here in America. I guess that it's not that good or something. I'm not talking about mainstream. I'm talking about real music. And to the UK...You can have your Coldplay and Radiohead back. We're done with them."
4,Kooper fans need this,"I recently picked up a used Championship Wrestling LP and it is outstanding. Though some might complain about Kooper's few vocals, the guest vocalists (including Mickey Thomas and Valerie Carter) do outstanding work on Al's terrific song choices and arrangements. Skunk Baxter's guitar work just adds to the enjoyment throughout (The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is a standout and includes one of the two Kooper vocals) Kooper fans, you need this."
3,Just Received our WC,"This item arrived quickly from Amazon, no damageThe water pours a little slow compared to the cooler it is replacing.This is a replacement for a 14 year old coolerWe turned the hot water off as we won't use it very often.The warnings on the inside of the refrigerator are ludicrous, its is translated Chinese -I scanned the image and posted it around the web it was so funny (whats funny is how horrible the translation is and how totally politically incorrect it is)I hope it lasts, its working fine nowA"
1,Lasted 1 year + 1 week,"I thought I was getting a deal when I purchased this cooler/fridge for our small office. If I had known it would barely make it to one year, I would never have purchased it. First, we had trouble with the fridge not cooling, so our milk went sour. After messing around with it and rebooting the unit, it started to work again. Today, 1 day + 1 week to the day I ordered the unit, it began leaking!! It just isn't worth the trouble to fix the thing, so now I have to dig out the paperwork and see if I can get any sort of refund. I do NOT recommend this product."
1,"Leaks, worthless","This seemed great when first purchased, and worked well. Within 4-5 months the hot water valve began leaking. I'm throwing it out rather than allowing it to annoy me further with their lack of customer service."
5,Gentle and great scent!,"Regular adult soaps were leaving my skin much too dry, so I decided to try out baby soap. I bought a bar of this and loved it! It's very gentle on my skin and it has a wonderful fragrance! I pair this with Johnson's Baby Cream and I'm super soft and baby fresh all day long!!"
4,Great Book,"I thought this book was wonderfully laid out for anyone new to the stockmarket. The book is full of examples and real life situations which makes the book easier to understand, and more fun to read. I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to get a better grip on there knowledge of the stockmarket."
5,Excellent primer on investing for the long term.,"I can't recommend this book enough. It dispels the myth that you have to invest using little-understood, complicated formulas to make money in the stock market. Ninety percent of investing is really very simple... and this book explains it beautifully. If you'll just pay attention to the Gardner's simple message, you'll beat 90 percent of the ""Wise"" money managers. Read it and learn."
1,this book is bad,"The information contained in this book has been discredited by lots of academics and yes, even by the Gardner brothers themselves. Don't buy this or any of their terrible books."
4,Ideas for beginners,"This is a good book for beginners intersted in finance. Their web site and message boards are more comprehenisve for the 'fool' teachings. Nevertheless, I still reccommend this book for beginners in investments"
4,This book is a must for all investors!,"Having being ""robbed"" by my broker, I wanted to get a fresh start on investing. I was referred to the Motley Fool by a friend, and have read all their books.This book is a very good book, not only for those who want to take control of their own investing, but even for experienced investors who need a fresh look at investing.The techniques for investing in this book are well researched and well proven. In addition, the Fool do not recommend trying out their techniques unless you think that their investing methods will work.I ...found this book to be the start of my investing, and I must say it has been a fruitful start."
3,Better a Trader than a Fool,"I was expecting a book about being an active trader, but this one is for a comotosed investor.Active trading is what all the press coverage mentions, and this book turns it nose up at the activity that is makin so many people rich. Instead it favours buying and holding which is a bit dull.I bought this book at the same time I bought Mind of a Trader (FT Pitman 1998) which is a lot better for beating Wall Street by far greater margins than the Fools. Better a Trader than a Fool"
3,"Not bad, also one I would not highly recommend.","I borrowed this book form the library last month. The one thing I don't like about the book is the part where Pyungsoo tells Junehee that she looks like ""an Africa"" when she came back from vacationing with her family. If Koreans/Asians think Africans look strange then I wouldn't want my children reading this book(when I do have children). It seems that Asians dislike Blacks and it shows up everywhere,from business/economics to publications and also socially. Otherwise the book is okay,and it gives adolescents good knowledge of Korean culture and lifestyle."
2,The Long Season of Rain,"I read this book for a school project and I was really dissapointed with it. It was very good in terms of educating of some of the traditions of a South Korean Family, but the story really wasn't that interesting. Each chapter seemed to have a story of its own, and half of the time all it is is parents fighting. Overall I was dissapointed with this book."
5,Grateful XM Subscriber,"This car kit is a must for charging and playing. Works so well via input jack on rear head unit. Had same item but I abused it and it broke ($80.00).Great price for this product, brand new sealed package. THANK YOU!!!"
2,Curious??,"If you are curious as to what John's been up to in the afterlife take a look at this DVD. The thing about these types of progams is that you must first surrender some skepticism to even try to believe what's being presented. I lean to the notion of an afterlife, who wouldn't want to live on? And connecting with someone who's moved on...well. For the price, give it a go and watch it on a rainy night if you want to have a haunting feeling as you watch it. At the very least it's entertaining and curious. I felt the fella who was channeling music from John was the most sincere and wouldn't it be more accurate to say he's inspired by John's music?? At worst, it's a poor attempt to get this Beatle fan to believe that the sensitives in this show got the ""real"" John Lennon. The message of ""peace"" is so dead (pun intended) common, how could they assert it was John Lennon? Maybe it was just a nice Englishman who knows John on the other side...; )"
5,Excellent,"My son's B-Day is Halloween and this was one of his favorite videos when he was little. He just turned 18yrs old and was wanting to see it again. It brought back alot of fun memories. It's a fun little Halloween adventure. It arrived in excellent condition, was a great price, and fast delivery. I love Amazon =)"
4,Cute Movie for family viewing,I bought this for my grandchildren ages 5 and 8 to watch. They loved it.
1,Don't waste your time,"I received this item and there is nothing on the packaging that tells you what type of batteries it needs. You have to dig pretty hard to find the answer to that one. It takes 2 - AA's by the way. So, as I was out of AA's, I ventured out and bought some batteries. Upon inserting the batteries in the unit, I decided I would like to preset some FM radio stations. Before I could get the first station preset, the tuning buttons quit and I could not change the stations at all. What a waste of time and money. I will look for another product by another manufacturer as I am returning this one for a full refund."
3,Moments of brilliance marred by moments of Zzzz...,"Okay, so I've been nice to Coldplay. But after awhile, my mind changed. Parachutes has, in terms of quality, a bit of everything, be it brilliant (Shiver, Yellow, High Speed, Everything's Not Lost) or boring (Sparks, Trouble, We Never Change). So is this worth a purchase? That depends. Are you the patient kind, willing to slog through several tracks of filler to get to the brilliance? If so, by all means go after it. If not, that's what downloading's for."
2,I don't get it,"I don't understand the fascination with this band. I have read all of the rave reviews calling Coldplay ""atmospheric"", ""beautifully tender"", ""touching"", blah, blah, blah. I must be missing something because this album is BORING.I can normally listen to and enjoy atmospheric music or more tempered rock music with original sound twists, but this is neither. This is simply Oasis at a slow pace. It has neither the atmospheric tones of Radiohead or the sorrowful guitar riffs on some of the Pumkins more relaxed tunes (See ""Spaceboy"" - Siamese Dream). The album comes close at times, but it's just missing a certain element to push it into the territory that these critics want to place it in. Perhaps the album drones on too much without enough variety between songs. If you suffer from insomnia I would suggest you chew some valerian root and listen to this album for 30 minutes."
4,Sounds like Teenage Fan Club,"This is a great album that brings hope to those of us that remember early Toad the Wet Sprocket, Jesus and the Mary Chain, Faith No More, and Teenage Fan Club.The most original album I've heard in quite a while."
3,Not as good as their second album,"I bought this album after being blown away by ""Rush of Blood"". Not nearly as good as that album. The talent is there but it's not as mature or as much fun."
4,Solid British indie rock,"The comparisons to Jeff Buckley and Radiohead are good start, but Coldplay are neither as dramatic as Radiohead nor as folky as Jeff Buckley (thankfully, not as despondent either). A better point of reference would be to the excellent and maybe now defunct British indie band Adorable. Parachutes sounds like a sequel to Adorable's masterpiece ""Against Perfection"". Coldplay delivers melodic, guitar-driven indie rock with great vocals - and like Radiohead, the voice is an instrument here. Some of the songs sound thin and self-indulgent, but as their writing matures, Coldplay looks poised to make their mark on indie rock."
5,Best CD of the Year,"I can't even say in words how great this CD is. The lyrics, the sound, the music... it all fits together extremely well. It is a very mellow album and it is so relaxing. Highlight singles include the single ""Yellow"" which I'm sure everyone knows already. You may ask if you only know ""Yellow"": Do the rest of the songs sound like ""Yellow""? The answer to that question is yes, they are all in the same style as ""Yellow"" yet they are diverse enough where you don't think every song sounds the same.""Don't Panic"" is instantly captivating and addicting. You'll want to listen to it over and over. Second single ""Shiver"" is more upbeat than ""Yellow"" but still keeps with the overall mellow theme of the album. Another highlight is the piano-ballad ""Trouble"" This is a must buy! If you get it and you like it, a similar album is ""The Man Who"" by Travis."
4,Simply Soothing,"Parachutes is simply soothing. Perfect study music. There is something profound about the way British/European Rock bands perform their music. Parachutes seemed to be done with great thoughtfullness. Songs like Sparks, Yellow, and the whiney, Trouble all have lyrics that can apply to anyone and their situation(s). The lead singer has a voice that draws you into the music, and the minor-key songs, which make up most of the album, almost bring tears to your eyes, when you listen to them. I believe that Cold Play has staying power. I hope they hold on to their definitive style, by not getting drawn into the pop world."
4,Hunch Confirmed!,"I happened to catch part of the broadcast that the band did on KCRW a couple of weeks ago and liked all of the songs played. I didn't get around to buying the disc until two days ago and am impressed and extremely happy with my purchase. I like their sound, however, I want to caution them to avoid the ""always know it's (fill in the blank name of a band)"" syndrome. All of the tracks are distinctive, but have a similar quality. For now, I'll just say, it's one I'd recommend buying to anyone."
2,*Yawn*....,"Perhaps last year's greatest musical irony was that most of the critics who found Radiohead's stunning, atmospheric Kid A to be boring/pointless/whatever other misconception they could conjure up (the rock equivalent of player-hatin') seemed to be head over heels for Coldplay's Parachutes. This is solid stuff; good singin', good playin', and ""Yellow"", hit or not, is a beautiful song. But what it doesn't do is take a single risk, and there's not a band out there who couldn't do four-stark-chords-and-passable-lyrics just as well, if not better. They're promising... but not quite there yet."
5,great album!,"A great album with hit songs and includes my personal favorites: sparks, yellow, and trouble. Coldplay albums never seem to disappoint!"
4,4 stars,I think this is Coldplays best album. As a whole it is better than Rush of blood to the head. Every song is good beside Spies which i really dont like.
1,The best example of modern pop trash,"I bought this after hearing part of clocks, and let me tell you, I regretted it, a lot. The only good track is 'Don't Panic'.Tiring, terrible."
2,Solid,"A good album and a deserved mercury nominee, not as outlandish as radiohead or bubbly as travis but quite good nevertheless. whatever about ""Yellow"", ""trouble"" for me is the standout track."
2,Gosh this IS what i call - boredom.,"The only good tracks in this album are 'Trouble' and 'Yellow', and the rest of them are just boring fillers. I almost fell asleep by listening to this cd and the singer's voice starts to get really annoying and boring after awhile. by the way have I mentioned that all the songs on this cd sound the same? no, I haven't? well, now i'm mentioning it..."
2,Great for the uninspired,"If you're one of those people who thinks The Bends is a better album than Kid A (hint: it ain't) then you're going to love this. Nice, inoffensive, catchy pop rock at it's most.. well... NICE. There's approximately a trillion (give or take a few million) bands who do this sort of thing much better, but Coldplay get the hype, so Coldplay get the sales. Enjoy!"
1,Terrible,"I cannot say that I have heard an album so soft and ""fluffy"" to be called any type of rock. This is Brit pop garbage."
3,I can take it or leave,"I hear a lot of Radiohead in this band, which makes me want to listen to Radiohead, ... There was a lot of hype on my college campus when Yellow was released, so I gave it a listen. It's annoying. Seriously, this is what would happen if Jewel and Dave Matthews got together and had a kid who was a singer. This just isn't all it's cracked up to be and I must say I was very disappointed with the buildup to my first listen. Good, but by no means great."
5,love it!,I purchased this cd a few months a go and still are listening to it in the car .Never get tired of it.Would definetely recomend it.
2,Not as much of a coldplay fan anymore,"Like Coldplay, but maybe only their hits. This album was cool but it wasnt for me. Maybe after a while it will grow on me"
4,Angora Handbook,"This is a great reference book for your angora rabbit library. I has a lot of useful information about the rabbit and also covers a little bit on spinning, dying, drum carding, and felting."
2,great concepts awash in babble,"the same great motley investment lessons, but unfortunately awash in a sea of wordy babble and silliness. save yourself some money and download the free '13 steps' PDF from the motley fool website -- you'll get 80% of everything in this book, and you'll get in in 60 pages instead 300, for free! that last 20% you can find on the motley site anyways. i haven't read the other motley books but if you're heckbent to buy a book i've got to believe 'the MF investment guide' is better than this."
3,"rookie tips, but good guidance","The financial advise in this book is plenty sound, but at times simplistic. I did get huge mileage out of the car negotiating advise (the book paid for itself almost a thousand times over) though! Generally, the book has an enthusiastic, pep-talk feel to it that will make the late starter feel much less panicked, and the early bird alot less intimidated."
4,The Fools RULE!,Great book. I love the Motley Fool books. They cover all the latestest topics with time proven advice and information.This is a great starter book for any beginner looking to find and build net worth.
4,"Enjoyable, informative, highly recommended.","Very good book of Jennifer Jones. Easy to read, interesting, one of the few books on Jennifer. I'm very happy to have bought it and read it. Ironic that Jennifer ends up, the last five years of her life, at her son's Malibu beach house with his family, her grandchildren after her fabulous ride of a life, but the son is Robert Walker, Jr., who looks and sounds like Robert Walker, the husband and their two sons Jennifer walked out on for a life instead with career power David O'Selznick. Things go full circle, and God works in strange ways!"
3,Hmm,"Well, after 2 weeks of turning this lamp on and off it finally started doing the trademark lava flow of the lava lamp. It looks really nice and does different things from huge lava flows up and down to many little ones. Now it has been alsmot 4 weeks and the light has gone out. I am not sure if it is broken or if it just needs a new bulb. I think this is a bit early for either to have happen, especially at that cost. It is really neat and no one who comes over has seen anything like it. I love having ti on, when it worked."
1,"cheap tacticts rate one star, this book is ""to be continued...""","The first 3 or 4 books of the series were pretty good, then they went downhill quick. The last few were getting good again, but now they are falling back on cheap tactics to sell more books. THIS BOOK ONLY HAS HALF THE STORY... It's ""to be continued"" in the next book. Cheap tactics, so this series has ended for me. I won't buy any more of them."
3,Don't buy it yet....,"Wait for Firestorm to be available. This is only the first half (I hope it's half and not 1/3!) of the story.Not the best of the Starfist books, perhaps that will change when the next part comes out. Of course, that could be a year or more and who will remember the details and characters by then? I'm very disappointed. Still, it was fun while it lasted. I won't go over the story, that's already been covered in other reviews; just let me warn you that you won't be satisfied with how it ends."
4,great for the price.,"Works fantastic, my only complaint is the wall mounting bracket on bottom is very flimsy, its just a thin sheet of metal."
3,Compact and powerful,"Fan works really well, but the design of the buttons is the only thing I don't like. I just want a high/med/low/off setting, I don't need a timer or whatever else on a fan. I don't want to spend more than a second or two turning on a fan, and I don't remember all of the settings on this every time so I end up fumbling with it. Poor design on the buttons and a bunch of functions I don't need.It's a little quieter than some fans, which is the reason we bought it, but is still very audible."
4,Excellent for the price,"Everything about it is great. It even comes with screws for the mounting! The oscillation works amazingly and circulates the air very well, and does a much better job than our other oscillating fan, despite it being smaller, and more quiet! This thing keeps our rooms considerably cooler than we expected. Just wish it came in black!"
2,get what you pay for,"I purchased 2 of these based on the reviews. I am considering returning them. On the plus side this fan is quiet, has a timer, is sleek. It has a small footprint so would be good for under a work desk. This fan is NOT powerful!I think it is smarter to go to one of those huge stores that line up all their fans in June, where you can turn each one on and see how it works and THEN make a purchase."
3,"Ours broke, no help from Soleus yet","We bought this fan in June. When I took it out of the box I imagined the insides were as cheap as the plastic blades and housing. Sure enough, 10 weeks later, it stopped working. Seems like the on-off switch.Soleus answered our email about the problem, asking for proof of purchase. We sent the email receipt from Amazon, and haven't heard back from Soleus.Great fan, in terms of quiet and comfort. Does anyone make a fan anymore that will hold up over time?"
2,wall mounting,"WHEN I WALL MOUNTED THE SECOND FAN ,ASTHE FIRST ONE, IT DID NOT WORK.AFTER READING THE OPERATING MANUAL AGAIN TO SEE IF THE INSTALLATION WAS AS DISCRIBED I CALL THE MANUFACTURER. I WAS TOLD THAT THE FAN WOULD WORK WHEN MOUNTED WITH THE CONTROL SWITCHES IN UP POSITION."
5,Soleus Air Fan,Excellent Customer Service. Fan is very convenient. I love having the timer & the oscillation feature. I do plan to use the wall-mount feature this winter. I may order a second fan.
1,Does not oscillate it just has a rotating grill,"I absolutely needed an oscillating wall mounting fan, and this fan is not that. It's not what I would ever call oscillating as the fan itself does not move back and forth, just the grill rotates. I realize that some consider a grill moving in a circle with ""fins"" that direct the air in different directions to be oscillating, but I do not, and think people need to know this before ordering this fan and waiting over a week to receive it. Based on the photos it appears that the fan ""sweeps"" back and forth in an oscillating motion like every other fan like it on the market that claims to be oscillating.So, hopefully this vendor lets me return it, as paying $13 for shipping that takes over a week is annoying enough! Now I have to find a fan that will do what I need, and unfortunately it won't look as cool mounted to the wall as this would have."
2,cheap piece of junk,"I ordered this fan because I liked the modern look it had. When I finally recieved it there was a loud ticking sound every time I turned it on. I was very close to returning it, but I decided i'd try to fix the problem myself first. When I took the outer cover off the fan I noticed the blade was about to fall off because the screw was so loose. Upon further inspection I notice that about 90% of the screws that hold the fan together were also loose. Whoever manufactured this did a pis poor job in doing so. My four year old daughter could have done a better job putting this thing together. If I would not have tightened everything up myself the fan surely would have fallen apart in no time. Waste of time and money!"
2,Doesn't Push Much Air Comparatively,"Not a bad fan, since it's very quiet, but it achieves that relative silence at the expense of the amount of air pushed (CFM), which I would estimate is about half that of my two other quiet 12 inch table fans. The blade and grille design create a large hole in the middle of the airstream, thus additionally reducing it from even a normal 10 inch fan. Overall if you're looking for maximum air for minimum noise you need a bigger fan, but the problem is that these big QUIET ones are either rare and hard to find, or expensive.I like the regularly designed table fans better as well since 1) with their adjustable heads, one can direct the airstream more easily, and 2) their footprint is smaller. One can, however shave the plastic notch off and remove the back grille which otherwise prevents this fan from rotating downwards."
3,not super great,"After all the raving reviews, I had thought that this fan would be superior to most, but I find that, although it is a good fan and fairly quiet, it is not exceptional. A good option if you are looking for a small, stylish fan, but not for superior cooling."
2,"For a wall mount setup, you need to mount it to your left side.","The fan only seems usable in a wall mount setup if it will be to the left of you, based on the way it swivels at an angle. I'm returning it for a different fan."
5,Just Right!,"I bought this fan to use on my office desk, so it needed to be compact, unobtrusive, and QUIET (in addition to cooling me off). I have been very pleasantly surprised, as it fulfills all my requirements and for very little money.I haven't tried wall-mounting it, though I understand it works that way as well. The oscillating feature is nice, as is the adjustment of fan direction. I greatly appreciate the silent operation, ease of operation, and good airflow at any speed. Definitely worth a lot more than I paid for it!"
4,great parts box,"I use this box to hold electrical connectors. I like it because it is weather proof, and made fairly sturdy. I can get two years of use out of each box, and i use it daily."
4,Incredible,"My first real taste of PJ Harvey, recommended to me by a friend, and I thoroughly enjoyed all of it. I particularly love the slower, more ominous songs like 'a beautiful feeling' and 'you said something', but I'm not against the happier songs at all. From the little I've heard of 'Is this Desire' I'd say that PJ communicates anger and depression a lot more beautifully than the kind of blisfull happiness of some of these tracks, but we shouldn't hold that against her. An awesome album, by any standards."
2,if i wanted a patti smith album...,"this album was a huge disappointment- very bland, very commercial. like 'to bring you my love', she wears her influences on her sleave. patti smith could sue. she even borrows lyrics from nick cave. maybe mick said it was ok. speaking of mick harvey, where is the rhythm section? rob ellis is not supposed to be playing disco beats. musically and lyrically, this has none of the depth or darkness from ""is this desire"", and lacks the rawness of her first two. but the lyrics...look for this to be a VH1 favorite."
4,PJ Harvey,"I like this CD. Received it in a timely manner. There was nothing wrong with the CD itself, but the case was cracked. Nothing to get upset over though."
1,I JUST DON'T GET IT,"P.J. Harvey is most defintely one of the most critically praisedartists of the 1990s.It's impossible to read any ""Best Of The '90s"" list without seeing one of P.J. Harvey's albums on there.And to a ""Rolling Stone"" editor,she's probably a goddess.Now I will say that I did like the single ""Rid Of Me"" but I just don't see how she gets all that praise.Look,I listened to this album and my eyes started glazing over.I listen to EVERYTHING.And I love good,emotion-filled music that P.J.'s music is touted to be but I listened and I just don't see anything worthwhile.Maybe I'm missing something.If I am,can somewhere please tell me..."
3,Where's the angst?,"I love PJ Harvey and yes I have all her albums, her poster on my wall, tapes of her shows.... yeah yeah you know where this one goes.BUT this is my least favorite album of hers. Too much love, not that well crafted songs(sorry, she's done better), it just seems like she's headed in the wrong direction on this one(would you like rock star with that?), and well they try to make her look pretty when we all know that Polly Jean is an average looking woman, I think she is beautiful but in an ""hey i'm british and live in the country"" sort of way.I want the old angsty, drag queen looking, fisty Polly Jean Harvey back. And the big hair.Change is good but it has to be good change, ya know what i mean?(i'm gonna be torched for this one aren't i?)"
3,CD,"PJ has always been very avant guard. This cd is probably the least strange of all her stuff. Still, although I like it, it's not something I can listen to all the time."
2,"A2,PJ?","I write this review after giving PJ's latest a month's worth of listens.Some songs, such as Good Fortune and The Whore's Hustle..., have such a nice cute flavor of Patti Smyth packed inside that it makes me ill (don't get me wrong, I like Patti's work quiet a bit, just not so unrefreshingly repackaged). Others, such as the duet with Radiohead's vocalist, have lyrical content so cliched and predictable they feel more atuned to a boy band album than PJ. It makes me wonder if these two musicians really had any desire to work together at all, or if this was just a science project gone awry cooked up by one of the top brass at Island.""Is This Desire?"" left PJ, to her credit, in a place almost impossibly high to work from (my favorite album from 1998 hands down) - but I guess I had hoped to hear her work continue to break off into new directions, and not take me through the beaten path."
3,"Intersting story elements, but not up to DeMille standards","Mayday had interesting story elements, and a couple of plot twists, but many sections were over-written and drawn out. It was a solid C+ effort."
5,Heart pounding suspense,"As usual with DeMille I learned so much, while at the same time holding my breath. If you like DeMille you'll like this book."
4,Great action-packed read,"This was a very good read in the typical ""movie for your mind"" style of DeMille. It had a solid plot, and didn't stray from it. The crippling of this airliner has major effects on the lives of several characters in this book, and DeMille does a wonderful job of getting into the different mindsets of each of those characters.The dialogue is flawless and the plot is very solid. I thought the characters could have been a little more detailed. It is still a very good read, and I'd recommend it to anyone that likes a fast paced action/adventure book. It's one that leaves you wondering how the protagonist is going to get out of this situation.The only reason I gave it a 4 is because, as a huge DeMille fan, I didn't think it was a good (detailed) as his later works. The aviation expertise that Block added to the book are a huge plus though.Enjoy this one, then read Plum Island, The Lion's Game, and Cathedral."
3,Mayday,"Was not up to the usual Nelson DeMille standard, this book was too drawn out and could have been written in half as many pages."
4,Excellent Book! The quintessential page turner!,I was first captivated by Demille's work with the legendary 'The Charm School'This book is one of his best!Great thriller.The nail biting experience at its best.Pure Awesome.
4,Held my interest throughout,"If you like novels based around commercial flight (see also John Nance's books) you're going to like DeMille's book, Mayday. It's been around for a while, but I just discovered it and glad I did. Some of the story line at the end is a stretch, but if you can get around that you won't be sorry.David Faxon"
5,DE MILLE IS GREAT,LOVE ALL OF HIS BOOKS I HAVE READ THEM ALL AND A GIANT FAN. CAN'T WAIT FOR HIM TO WRITE THE NEXT ONE.
4,Don't plan on getting anything done!,I couldn't read May day fast enough...I felt apart of everything that was happening. Talk about action and suspense! Now I need to read it again....slower this time to read what I missed. I recommend this for you!
3,"Mayday is a good journey, with caveats","The story maintains a good level of suspense throughout, and creates a number of interesting conflicts.There is enough accurate technical detail, however if you want to get picky there is one instancewhere even typical suspension of disbelief is not enough.Also, it would be good to know ahead of time that this was an update of a novel first published in the 1970's.That being said, it was a quick and fairly entertaining read."
4,Excitement and Heartbreak,I worked in the Airline business for over 34 years. The aeronautical aspects in this book were fascinating. But the author drew you in with the human aspects which we can all relate.Reading this book was mesmerizing for the politics and decision making of top ranking executives. However I hope I never meet anyone capable of these acts.You will not be able to put this book down.Enjoy.
2,Obsolete firmware do not buy,"I had the same issue of the unit freezing when trying to play the new talking Heads DVD-audio discs. Yamaha will send you a refurbished unit if you pay to ship yours out to them, but they admit that won't solve the problem which appears to be firmware related. Yamaha offered no other solutions. Further online research showed people having the same lockup issue with Neil Young DVD's from 2004. Shame on Yamaha for not making good on this"
5,Wrong version,"We had to return this book because there are two versions with the same cover picture and we ordered the wrong one. If we had known that there was another version we would have looked more closely. The actual book is amazing, our group has met twice and we love it."
5,I have a story to tell...,"I have a story to tell...I saw Michael perform in front of a packed house at Cactus Cafe in Austin one night. I was amazed. The whole audience was captivated by Michael's music.So...a day later, I go to Common Grounds at Baylor University because one of my friends wants me to come hear ""some guy who is good at the guitar."" When I get there, Michael is setting up for the show. When I see that he is the guy from the previous night's show, I run up to him and say, ""Dude, I saw you last night...You were awesome!"" I was pumped that I was going to get to see him perform again. Once again he put on an awesome show.He has a soothing and unique style of music, and his goofy stage humor and side jokes entertain the audience rolling with laughter. So, not only should you see a live performance, but you should also get a CD...in fact I am listening to his CD as I write this review. YOU ROCK MICHAEL....ok that is the end of my story-Chad Rainey"
5,hooked on the old Dallas just like the new one,hooked on the old Dallas just like the new one. got this for my daughter who never saw the first one. She's hooked too!
2,This singer can NOT be the future of this band,"David Fremberg is meant to be singing live on stage - the acting stage. It's a very emotional voice, able to contrive a whole range of feeling. Unfortunately, Fremberg is unable to display a range of *melody*. It's amazing how quickly these songs just die, because on any given track, David sings only 5 or 6 different notes. Songs stop becoming songs as soon as he enters - they morph into ""displays"".And I don't know about you, but I just hated it, every quiver and rasp. II = I ends up sounding like a quirky off-Broadway soundtrack, rather than an experimental rock band. This isn't music, it's a musical.If that's what you want for your band, Johan, more power to you. But if you wake up one morning and realize that Fremberg is the wrong guy for the job, you'll probably find more than one fan (and probably even fellow band member) that feels the same.Till he's gone, I'm not buying any more CDs - I should have stopped at EOTW."
5,James Dean Died Here,"As a local historian, I found this book a welcomed addition to my personal library. Chris Epting does a fabulous job at locating the places that we have all seen or heard about in the movies and in the news. With an address, summary, and photo, you can now see in print and even go there yourself to see where, when, why, and how it happened. What a catchy title ! If it caught your attention, it is only a slight look into what is a must have book for all of you trivia and pop iconists."
2,Underwhelmed,"I wasn't impressed. They should price this on the honor system and let you pay if the information is useful. A lot of burden is on the requester to ask the right question in the first place because there are no second takes.The answer I received was so sanitized and abstract, on the honor system I can say I would have told them how they missed the mark and not paid them. That would tend to make them responsible for clarifying what people can expect, or maybe allow a person at least one follow-up question in case the first question resulted in a technical term that needs a follow-up to make the first answer useful. As is I wouldn't use it again."
4,Love 'I Still' & The Boys!,It's been over 12 years since the boys hit the music scene with 'We Got It Going On' and won millions of fans with their S/T debut and sophmore effort 'Millenium' but one thing still remains true after all these years. Even after the boy band phase has been over and long gone the boys still got it going on and are the only band to have survived the era. This single 'I Still' is a beautiful ballad and one of my favorites by the band. The only thing negative I can say about my purchase of the 'I Still' single is that its a cardboard slim case and not the slim jewel case I thought it would come in. I dont think the site mentioned it wasnt a jewel case either so thats disappointing but other than that the band rocks and the song/single is awesome. I give this cd a 4 out of 5 only because of no jewelcase and being stuck with cardboard case that I dont prefer. Still worth buying though.
1,Falling Awake,This book was horrible!! It is a total waste of money! The extreme dream concept was totally unbelievable (extreme dreams are supposedly so real that they are indistinguishable from real life).
5,Love It!,"Pretty Frost Red color. Revlon has some beautiful Red colors for the Holidays.If you are on the fence and want some red with frost, buy this one."
2,Ok I saw it finally and it [was bad],"WORST POISON IVY! I hated it!,First of all it changes the whole orignal storyline.Violet is Ivys sister HELLO! Ivy wasnt even her real name! It wasnt even her real name,Sarah Gilbert made it up.And also I thought mom was as ivy said in the orignail ""a coke addict who died in her 40's"",Mom didnt look like one in this one.And it confuses you,like she has two personalitys or something. first , quiet,psycho bitchy,quiet,psycho bitchy.It totally throws you off with this whole ""im psycho because i kill people and talk to a doll"" thing.Obiovusly the film makers didnt see the first two,and it shows."
5,Jaime Pressly,"Lets face it, she is the hottest in this movie. Tons of ""full"" nude scenes make this movie awsome. My favorite is when she strips in front of the pool, then goes for a swim. I love you Jamim!"
5,DAMN!,"I didn't give this movie five stars for Oscar-winning performances. Yes the cast does do an okay job, but Jaime Pressly's flawless body steals the show. Like I said, DAMN! So, if you're looking for a deep, thought-provoking movie look esle-where, but if you wanna see a great T&A flick this is the one."
2,Disappointed,"I expected alot more from this story. Missing is the storyline tie ins to provide continuity to the Star Trek universe. What's more, the authors would have us believing that 80% of Star Fleet is Jewish, Arab, or is intimate with Jewish customs. Enough already! We know Jewish people are great and that they will share in the future, I didn't need the entire story line to convince me of this. I think the idea behind the plot was a good one, it just got lost along the way."
3,Alphabet Soup,"If you are into systems thinking, you probably already know most of the material in this book. It has two good case studies of strategy planning using system tools. The concepts are great, but this is a poorly written book. You would think it was written in German and then poorly translated into English. It consistently uses unfamiliar acronyms, making it read like alphabet soup."
5,THE SION REVELATION,"IF DO YOU REALLY ENJOY DA VINCI CODE, THIS HAS TO BE THE NEXT ONE YOU MUST TO READ. VERY HISTORICAL EVIDENCES WILL SHOWING YOU THE ANSWERS IN WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE ABOUT SOME DETAILS IN THE DA VINCI CODE.INGRID"
5,Outstanding movie,"Even if you don't sign or sign a little or are fluent, see it! What you don't know, you will learn & see what has been going on and, surprise surprise!"
5,"If you love OZ, you HAVE to get this book!!!","OH MY GOSH ..... This book is FABULOUS! I just love it.The pictures are beautiful, the stories fun, and the design is just well ... to die for! Timothy Shaner is a genius!"
5,delicious and unusual breads,"Has wonderful pictures and easy recipes for basic, French, Italian,Traditional,Herb,and fruit breads.Very informative history and techniques for making bread"
1,not for novices,"unless you are able to know when ""oh no this is not right"", and what to do this recipes book is not for you. its worth the 50 cents i spent at the garage sale and not much more."
3,The Cliffs Notes Version,"I purchased this dvd after watching the movie ""Hoffa"" and reading a biography of the infamous labor leader. I was looking for a good quality dvd biography with footage of the man himself, newsreel footage, interviews, etc... I felt that the A&E; Biography series would be the best, most reputable version.While the quality of the dvd, and the production itself, was up to A&E;'s high standards, the program itself is relatively short (approximately 50 minutes). I realized then that this was simply a dvd of the television program, sans commercials. This could have easily been a two hour program, covering the many facets of Hoffa's fascinating life.If you purchase this dvd, you will get a high quality production, but a brief one."
5,Great source for understanding & preparing whole foods!,"When delving into the world of correct eating habits, where do you start? Good Food tells all without being judgemental. Find out about storage, preparation, cooking (not many recipes, though) & the reason to eat whole foods versus the processed foods that our manufacturers ""suggest"". Well organized & very educational. It does make you think about what you have been feeding yourself (especially we Americans...is processed food killing us?) Highly recommended for those trying to feed their children the right way (proper nutrition is so important...do you think Fruit Loops & Fruit Roll-Ups constitute a fruit?). This book could change your life! Buy it now!"
5,Not Enough Goth,I'm not sure if this was meant to be a goth memoir or a novel. It was entertaining and well-written but I was expecting more of a focus on the goth subculture. Unfortunately the book does not live up to its title with only a few slight mentions of the gothic life style. I only bought and read this book as an account of growing up goth but it would be more interesting to someone from Cleveland. The many local references make the book better for someone from that area.
4,Fullers,"Interesting read, okay for beginning surgical tech class. Quite a few errors in diagrams and readings when compared with other textbooks though"
5,Adventure at its best for those who love action,"William Shatner is my favorite novelist. He knows how to write action stories that are also very thought-provoking. Shatner's name on a book means that you are going to have a quality read.Avenger is one of his best, thoroughly enjoyable. It is the end of the Trilogy that began with Return. It also preceeds the new series that begins with Spectre.Kirk, Spock, and Picard must solve the problem of the virogen plauge that is wrecking the Federation. Loose ends from previous Star Trek novels and movies are tied up.The book leaves one with a lot to think about with regard to ecology and eco-terrorism. The Federation by homogenizing environments puts the galaxy in danger of being overcome by disease.The story is also very moving and has a surprise ending I will not reveal."
4,"""Avenger"" is a good, fast-paced sequel to ""The Return""!","Shatner did it again! ""Avenger"" is a good book, but is isn't as good as ""The Return"". (But if you want to split hairs, I think you would be hard pressed to find a Star Trek novel better than ""The Return"") Although it features the Next Generation cast, this story is mainly about Kirk and Spock on their respective missions. Kirk to find the cure to the virus that has Starfleet placing entire star systems under quarantine. Spock searching for proof that his father Sarek was murdered. They intertwine with the Enterprise-E crew to make a story that will have you guessing until the end. It also does one heck of a job explaining Kirk's survival from the Borg Homeworld. ""Avenger"" also sets up the next novel in the series, ""Spectre"". A must read if you love Star Trek!"
3,A surprisingly weak offering in the series.,"Avenger is the kind of book that I both liked and didn't like at the same time. The virogen crisis and the intrigue surrounding Sarek's supposed murder kept me reading it, but a few other things made me want to stop. First, Mr. Shatner way overglorified James Kirk. Kirk was basically described as being the greatest hero the Federation had ever known, especially evident in the thoughts of a certain female officer he meets up with. Second, Kirk's philosophy concerning the balance of nature was more than a little hard for me to swallow, especially considering that it was coming from James Kirk of all people. And third, the subplot that gave the book its name was just too weird for me to accept. Overall, I think this book was well-written with some nice character development, but the things I listed above kept me from rating it any higher than three stars."
2,Stale air,"I am usually disappointed when the interview part of NPR's Fresh Air show ends and the tail end commentary or review fills out the show's hour...except when Geoffrey Nunberg gives one of his little radio essays on language. For that reason I was eager to read this book, but I was frustrated to find that Going Nucular is simply a collection of those radio essays, with a few newspaper columns thrown in. I had heard most of what I was now reading, and since all of the essays were written since 2001, they were mostly fresh in my mind. Not that they weren't interesting, but they simply weren't new. I suspect other regular Fresh Air listeners will have a similar reaction. After finishing the book I scanned the cover and could not find any indication that the book was a collection of old essays, which I found sort of ironic being that the Nunberg is a communication expert."
3,kind of a disturbing consistency. the black licorice is much better.,"I like Darrell Lea's black soft eating licorice, ordered this apple stuff on a lark (haven't seen it at stores). When I eat this apple kind, it makes me wonder what it is like to eat a partly dried glue stick, or perhaps a bar of deodorant. I mean, the taste is not bad, it's just such a very strange consistency. Anyway, there are a good number of flibbertigibbet reviews for this stuff, so good luck with it but I recommend the regular black kind!"
1,back away from the dvd...,"Ok, once again warner bros. is trying to get a little cash, by once again releasing a 4 episode set, compared to a 28 episode set. I would normally give all Batman DVDs a 5-star review, but this I cannot. This set contains four episodes....get ready for this....that have already been released on dvd in july!!! Sure it was released in a box set, and for only approximately $35.00 Compared to this $15 dollar set for 4 dollars, the box set is a VERY good deal. Appeasing kids for an hour is a good idea but for the pricing just go rent a dvd. Trust me, you'd be much better buying the box set for only 20 dollars more. But in case you're still wanting to get this dvd, it contains 4 eps. They include: a 2 parter w/ catwoman, an ep. w/ mr. freeze, and an ep. w/ an invisible foe. but believe me, the box set is way cooler (price and design and well, everything wise)"
2,Capresso MT-500 Plus,Extremely disappointed. The first cup is good but the carafe isn't even an insulated one! You're coffee has gone cold within 20 minutes even after the hastle of running the hot water to preheat the carafe prior to making the coffee every morning. After a couple months of that crap I finally pulled out my faithful old Gevela this morning and it's the first time my 2nd cup has been hot in a couple months without me having to nuke it to warm it. For $150 you think they'd at least provide an insulated carafe!!! Definite thumbs down. Wanna buy mine cheap?
1,"Capresso No, No!","What a major disappointment. I had a regular Capresso coffee maker that we loved and decided to spring for their top of the line model with thermos. This machine was more designed to make a fast pot of ""coffee"" but what you wind up with is a pot of flavored hot water. It brews so quickly, it misses the grinds. It is the weakest coffee I ever tasted. We actually take the brewed pot of coffee and have to pour it back through again in order to get something close to resembling what we used to get with our $50 Capresso coffee machine. Don't waste your money on this unit. I also bought another one of these machines at the same time for my daughter's house warming gift. Fortunately, we got to her before she ever used it and returned it for full credit. Don' waste your money."
3,Overrated,"Bought this after much online shopping and comparing, and really anticipated enjoying using such a fine machine. Am returning it. One key disappointment concerns the water chamber. It is awkward to fill with the carafe, and it doesn't show any measure for less than 4 cups of coffee. Making less than 4 cups requires guesswork or actually measuring water first and pouring it in. In addition, the numbers on the water chamber are impossible to read if you are over 40! Finally, we could overlook those issues if the machine produced fabulous coffee. But, even with high quality beans, coffee brewed by this machine was no better than that brewed in the free Gevalia machine we've been using for years."
3,"coffee is good, but drip stop is problematic","I agree with other reviewers, good coffee, but I too have had coffee dribble all over my counter if the pot is not aligned just so. Also, the drip stop (when you take the pot out to serve part way through a cycle) works far less reliably then other designs.I would have given them 4 stars, but I am also finding that their customer service is impossible to get on the phone.But it is pretty, and the coffee is good."
2,One of my least favourite Heyers,"I've been a Heyer fan since my teens, and I attempted to re-read this book recently. I could not finish it. After about 130 pages I figured I had better ways to spend my time and put it down. First of all, the interaction between the hero and heroine was almost non-existent while the mother/son interaction was entirely too prominent. Secondly, it seemed like Heyer repeated herself quite a few times in the 100+ pages I did read, and I found myself skimming paragraphs of dialogue that I felt I'd already read.For those reading Heyer for the first time I'd recommend one of her other books, like Sylvester, The Nonesuch, or Frederica. She really is a brilliant author but, in my opinion, this is not one of her better works."
5,Sit down on a rainy night and just enjoy!,"I think Georgette Heyer is a genius! Her romance novels are funny, light and entertaining and this is one of her best. One eratic, desperate and charming mother forces one son to impersonate his twin brother when he goes missing. Throw in the missing son's lovely fiance, her terrifying Grandmother, some annoying houseguests and you have a read that allows you to embrace the ridiculous along with Regency London and just giggle...Start with this one and then try ""The Talisman Ring"" or ""Friday's Child"" - both by Heyer."
3,A little thin,"I liked this story, but I found the plot a little thin. It was barely believable, and I wanted to see the romance between the two main characters developed a bit more."
1,Broken and Distorted,"Product arrived broken and inoperable, I just returned from Iraq and haven't had time to contact the seller. The product was packed for shipping in a very unstable manner."
2,Not worth the $$,"While great for the pictures and wiring diagrams, in depth detail on rebuilding any specific part is not there. Actually quite frustrating.The main problem is that too many model years are included to provide the required detail for a quality manual. For any specific system (fuel, ignition, engine, wiring) there are maybe two-three paragraphs of content for any specific model year. The content included barely skims the surface of what needs to be done, then moves on to the next model year.Very frustrating and not worth the money spent. The ONLY thing I found helpful was the wiring diagrams that I was able to find easily online for free.Needless to say, this book is being used as a coaster. I would like to sell it to a half-price bookstore, but don't want anyone else to go through the same frustration."
4,It's a good starting point...,"This book is a well intentioned attempt at explaining the development process. Unfortunately, development is too specific depending on project type and region to be easily summed up in one volume. If you are looking for a lengthy and well detailed process overview, this book is for you. If you need something a little more specific, keep searching and let me know if you find something."
3,I didn't ever read this,"I bought this book after reading a great review on it but then when I received it, it just looked so uninviting and ...boring, I just never read it. Maybe some day and when I do I'll add more to this review."
4,Great stroller!!,"I really love this stroller. I have had the Combi Savvy and Peg Perego Milano strollers and overall I like this one the best. It is lightweight, easy to open and close and most importantly my daughter loves it. The basket is large enough to hold a diaper bag and misc. things. The only thing that would make this stroller perfect is a larger canopy."
4,Powerful Story,"Came home late last night and flicked on the tv....this movie caught my eye and kept me on the edge of my seat. It had a strong, important message and is definetely worth your time!!!"
1,Awful,"This stuff does not even work a little bit. It claims that it works best in young males (early 20's) Well I'm 21, and I tried the 3 month supply. I'm about 2 1/2 months through, and I've seen LITERALLY no improvement. I take the pills as directed and I've had no results whatsoever. Please do not waste your time and money on this crap."
2,Nightmares,"Are nightmares supposed to be one of the side effects? I've had repeated intense nightmares while using the product. I've had to stop taking the recommended two tablets in the evening. Now I take just one.Haven't noticed any differences with hair, but that is hard to quantify."
1,Did Nothing for Me,I'm 25 and in the beginning stages of male pattern baldness. Tried this for 2.5 months and have seen no improvement. There is no credible study to prove that this pill does anything nor is it approved by the FDA. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,Brilliant.,"Excellent book, one of the best books of 1999. Great detail into the Romulan races, continuing the story of the Romulan Commander from the 'Enterprise Incident', and tying up a loose end from 'Yesterday' Enterprise. I always found the Romulans more fascinating than the Klingons, they were so devious, the Klingons are just brutes. The battle was good, and having Picard on the Stargazer was a nive touch. It's sort of like an intermediate point between TOS and TNG, 2344 to be precise. This book actually shows the battle the Enterprise-C has with the Romulans at Narendra III, it's brilliant. If you want a good book to read, buy this book."
5,Turmoil in the Romulan Empire? Nah...,"This book got me pretty hardcore into Star Trek books. I've already read some of them before it, but I love the way they've integrated Spock and the Romulans. Very good and well written story that never lets up in keeping the reader interested. I found it to be the Romulan Way of the present giving some more up to date information on the workings of the Romulan Empire."
4,Interesting Documentary re:9/11,"This play by play by American officials detailing their response on 9/11 to deal with the immediate threat posed from the air was very interesting. I was pleasantly surprised by how candid some of those officials were in their interviews. These were people who were actually engaged in the response that day, including the military, police, journalists and others from political circles. Dynamic film footage of events enhanced the points covered in the interviews.As an aside, it was also interesting to read the various reviews and stances taken by others who have seen this documentary. Whether one agrees with all of the information provided by those interviewed, or leans more towards a conspiracy theory, I highly recommend ""Clear the Skies: 9/11 Air Defense"" to anyone who has an interest in learning more about the tragic events of that day.For those hard of hearing, there were no subtitles available with this dvd."
5,Great Timeline of 9/11,This DVD is a must for those that want to understand the timeline of events for Sept. 11th. It is a very gooddepiction of how the events of that day were dealt withand how the continuity of government plan is supposed to work.Kudos to ALL the air traffic controlers who put everything on the ground safely in just a matter of hours!
3,This has its moments,"I will have to listen to Dicks Picks 1 again sometime, but this was probably the best pick in the series at the time of its release. Now that we are up to Dicks Picks 23 though this one has fallen much lower in rank.The sound fluctuates from being pretty good to ho-hum. There are times when both Phil and Billy need to be louder in the mix. There was a while where I really loved this Dark Star but as time passes it has lost alot of its luster for me. I don't know, this one is rather sloppy and it doesn't go anywhere that strikes me as being all that interesting. My personal highlight of this pick is the first Not Fade Away. Jerry has some really good stuff going on during that part, but even that could be more interesting if Phil and Billy were louder."
5,"Hard to find, harder to stop eating...","You can't find this item in the stores in our area anymore. It arrived quickly with no damage ready in time for the holidays. Fresh quality, great taste."
5,"I,m sure it would be great but..................",I am disappointed that you offer cd only..My many collections of music are on tapes thus excluding me from your many offerings...
5,Lotti Goes Classic I and II are superb!,"My high school students heard my Helmut Lotti CD's and have become big fans. Several of us attended a live performance in June 1999. You will thoroughly enjoy these two CD/s. Buy both...if you buy one, you'll be back for the other!"
2,more light than heat,"I bought this assuming, i could keep this about 4 feet away from the couch and it would keep the area by the couch warm. But all i got was bright orange light. Even the different power levels were not really helpful."
2,Broke after 1 year,"Worked great for a year, the suddenly stopped working. The heater provides great targeted heating when it works. Unfortunately Amazon only alolows returns for 30 days for this product."
3,This product should be a GOOD PRODUCT.,This is the replacement item after the 1st one had Safety switch out of order in about 10 days after I purchased.So far looks O.K. I need to wait and see how this item performance in the next two - three months after the Winter go throught next the month of May ( 2013) year then I could give you much more informations about this product.
5,Absolutely thrilled!,"FANTASTIC PRODUCT. Need I say more? I agree with everything the other five-star reviewers have written.I received mine today and plugged it in... Its like a miniature sun in your home, its super quiet, extremely light to carry, efficient, the oscillating feature is just great, its very modestly price for how good it is & above all, its heats like a dream, I have not even used the 800W yet as im still loving the 400W.The glow it emits is just so calming, just like standing infront of direct sunlight on a cold day... heats you beautifully.I could not be happier."
2,Not enough Heat for a big room,"I have a large bonus room with several large windows. Not very insulated. My old kerosene heater went out and I bought this Soleus Air MS-09 heater. Even though I could see the benefits of this radiant heater in a fairly closed space, I just couldn't get warm. I returned it and purchased a replacement kerosene heater which heats up the bonus room quite nicely.As far as the Soleus Air MS-09, I like the energy efficiency of it, but if's it real cold (less than 50 degrees) and you're not in close line of sight of the beam, it doesn't heat very well."
4,great resource,"I have looked at several editions of this book over the past few years and am always impressed by the amount of information it provides. This book does a great job of providing information on universities by state and by focus of study. It gives plenty of information to help potential graduate students make more informed choices. My only complaint is a small one. I would prefer if they added a way to look up specific degrees. Right now you have to look up each school to see the degrees or look it up by focus. If you wanted to earn an EdD for example, you would have to look through every school or subject listed. Not a big deal, but my only suggestion for improving this great book."
5,Fitness Journeys - Balinese Rice Fields,"Thanks to the Balinese Rice Fields Fitness Journey DVD, I enjoy exercising on my elliptical machine at home! It can be raining or dark outside, yet I find myself running in the Balinese Rice Fields. I experience its natural beauty as I pass by Balinese villages, and hear the sounds of the palm trees swaying in the breeze. My favorite journey is Village Run, which is about 20 minutes. It moves very fast, and I find myself working harder and raising my heart rate as I pedal on my elliptical. When I'm finished with my workout, I feel energized...not only from the aerobic exercise, but also because I experienced a beautiful part of the natural world."
4,"A thin but interesting set of actual case studies,mind food!","Not a working hand book per se as in other works, but an extremely well presented set of case studies. With so little published on this topic this book is certainly a good, if not expensive ($/page or word) addition to any engineers' libraray"
4,Beatles VI,i really liked the product. their were a little bit of damages in the cover but i enjoyd repairing it =] the vinyl is good. very happy with this perchase
5,Social Work At Work,"In Don't Call Me Mom: How To Improve Your In-Law Relationships, Leah Averick brings into focus one of society's most complex and troublesome relationships. By encouraging people from different walks of life to talk about their in-law experiences -- experiences that readers will quickly and easily recognize as applicable to their own life situations -- important insights and understandings are obtained. To this Averick adds her own useful interpretations and suggestions, in this way providing worthwhile guidelines to readers for dealing with their own feelings and behaviors in this important area of every day life."
3,Feel No Evil,"Feel No Evil is a great little mystery book that will keep you on your feet from beginning to end. There is very little romance in the book, but Romance fans will love the innocence that Samantha has in herself and that she finds in her relationship with John. Mrs. Aquilina gives us a taste of the law and how little we understand it and how it can work for and against us. It shows to be careful who we trust and the love and faith of family."
5,Spellbinding,"Feel no Evil is a must read, I found it difficult to put down. What happen to Samantha is really not to far from reality. Sexual abuse seems to dominate society these days. Betrayed by individuals of her own family, Samantha's life was chattered. Ms. Aquilina provides an excellent inside into the law and the system and how little we really understand it. It also showed me that as parents we really don't know what all is going on in the lives of our children. This book is a lesson for all parents to pay close attention to their children; it would also make an excellent movie."
3,Not Quite What It Appears,"Movie was represented as ""zone 1"". Actually, the dvd was ""zone 0"". Zone 0 dvds will not play on ""zone 1"" players. I had to give it away. Be careful how you list products!!"
1,Not worth a penny,The director and writers of this aimless menagerie of unrelated scenes must have been high on drugs. A total waste of time and money.
2,Why bother?,"Why did this person bother to write such an overly critical book about a band he/she clearly does not like (apart from the early stuff). One track will remind some readers of the Smiths we are told, another uses a similar keyboard sound to Genesis! This is garbage. Each to his own opinion but, having loved all incarnations of FM, a lot of this book misses the point. Omnibus should be ashamed for including this in their usually excellent series."
3,Disappointing Quality,"Unlike volume 1, 1950, the quality of this CD is disappointing. Basically, the first 14 cuts are fine, but starting with number 15 the quality is hit-or-miss. Several of the last songs were obviously taken from scratchy records without any attempt to clean up the sound. Patti Page's cut is especially bad. The CD has a good selection of songs--it's just unfortunate that the same care wasn't put into it as the 1950 CD.ADDENDUM: With more good cuts on this CD than most CD's and its bargain-basement cost, I recommend you purchase this CD even if only to complete the series--and if you purchase any volume, I think you will want the complete series. (See my reviews of the other 5 volumes.)"
3,An Average Read...,"I love Star Trek and I love the Reeves-Stevens writing team, but I have to say that THE RETURN was just an average read. The weakest point for me was the fact that the reader knew much of what was going on, and who was doing it, WAY before the characters. Thus, it was simply an effort of reading through the pages waiting for the characters to catch up. The mystery should be written for the reader, not the characters. The book did pick up toward the end (last 100 pages), and it was fun to see how many Star Trek references and characters could be cramed into one novel, but overall, it was a disappointment. I hope the others in the ""series"" get better. My recommendation of an excellent Reeves-Stevens Trek book is FEDERATION... one of the best. Period."
5,"excelente compilacion, cruda y austera , imprescindible","gran edicion que reune las obras de los animals bajo la perspectiva de su productor. temas iniciales, todavia enfrascados en el r&b primigenio, mucho bob didley y demas....encontramos la version definitiva de house of the rising sun..que mas decir......booklet modesto, sonido acorde a los años de las grabaciones. documento de una epoca........"
3,its ok,"Its about 5 young adults 3 females and 2 males and they were paid to go to a urban old house out in the middle of the woods to entertain a little kid on a act/play. Things start to get worse when there were rumors there was a rapest in the near area, and not to mention they were on the hit list. One by one the young adults gets killed. You will not believe who the killer is,, but then again... it sure did confuse me ..., This movie kinda lagged bad detail to information. its an ok movie... got some good scares but not so freaky. ALso it is dubbed in english, this movie was done by French actors. ..."
2,Watchable,"I just saw the DVD version of Deep In The Woods, and foundit so/so as Thrillers go. Good plot, but Acting/Directingfell short.Some Nudity, though it fit the story line and was notover done.It's watchable, but I would not pay (at a theater) tosee it again.see it again."
3,Better than most American Slasher Flicks,"Personally I think this is the best slasher film for a while. It has a great atmosphere, goods performances and good direction. May I suggest watching this film with the subtitles and in French the way it was intended. Most people I guess just don't get it especially the French themselves. They absolutely slate the film. At least Brian Yuzna (an Absolute genius himself) like this film. Goes to show great minds think alike."
5,"A wonderful read, knowing how it ends","I really enjoyed this book on many levels. For starters, it was great to read this knowing how the season ended. Watching the writers go through the roller coaster of emotions as the season progressed was delightful in a devilish sort of way. After seeing their complete despair following the third loss in the ALCS, I wanted to jump in and tell them not to worry, the best is yet to come! I also enjoyed the personal notes about the life of the writers... personal trips, ancedotes, and the e-mails. I appreciate Stephen King as a ""regular guy"" and, although enormously successful and wealthy, you could have a beer with him and talk about rock-and-roll, baseball, and whatever else came to mind. Stewart O'Nan is the most diehard of the two, going to batting practice, shagging balls in the stands, and nearly stalking players to get as close to the game as a fan can get. I highly recommend this book."
4,If you don't like baseball stop now,"Listen to two die hard fans in what turned out to be a magical season. I stopped being a big time Red Sox fan around 25 years ago when my significant other hogged the TV during baseball games. I never having heard or understood what ""Read Sox Nation"" meant or why Sweet Caroline had turned into a team theme.I felt the ""thrill of victory, and the agony of defeat"" in the voices of the two men who wrote the book. Stephen King is especially interesting as he gets more and more frustrated as the season went on.If you have ever rooted for the ""impossible"" to happen, this is a great listen."
3,A Mixed Bag,"The stuff written by Stephen King is excellent, insightful and witty. The portions written by O'Nan are none of those. It's too bad King couldn't have tackled this project by himself."
2,Just goes to show you...,"Because two guys are old pros doesn't necessarily mean that they can write about sports. For the first time in my life I appreciate the skill and craft that the professional sportswriter brings to his/her work. Because this, ach, reading this book is like being trapped on a desert island with the two worst bores from the sports bar. These aren't even the guys who jump up on the table and holler. At least those fellas have a stupid trick or two in them. No, King and O'Nan are the two quiet nerds at the end of the bar, droning meaningless statistics at each other. Hard to believe that anything could make the Red Sox' 2004 season look dull--but, in combining their lack of skill with the pressure to have a finished book on the shelves by Christmastime, King and O'Nan have managed it."
1,Highly scented with perfume!,The night time wrinkle cream is highly scented with perfume and causes eyes to water and sneezing. why is it necessary for a night cream to contain perfume!? If you have sensitive skin or sensitive to perfumes do not buy this product.
2,Overpowering frangrance,"I would honestly love this if it weren't for the fragrance. It seems to work great, but I just can't get past the smell. The fragrance is way to strong for something that's going on my face. I wound up going back to my old standby, Neutrogena, because the texture is very similar and it doesn't have an offensive fragrance."
1,Test this cream on small area first!,"I smoothed this cream on my face and neck, as the package directed. I woke up the next morning with a burn on all areas where the ROC night cream had been applied. Perhaps that is how it works? It burns the wrinkles off? Please test this cream in a small area before applying to your entire face and neck if you want to avoid my fate. The skin on my neck is actually peeling now, and it itches horribly! OUCH!"
3,A smooth placebo for the skin,"I must be in the minority here but my skin doesn't burn or tingle from this stuff. The lotion moisterizes the skin...and that's about it.Here are the listed ingredients as per the package:water, ceteareth-20, glycerin, isodecl neopentanoate, stearyl alcohol (which dries the skin), cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexl hydroxystearate, tetrahydroxypropyl ethylenadiamine, PEG-100, stearate, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, steareth-10, retinol, glycolic acid, copper clusonate, magnesium aspatate, zinc gluconate, butyrospermum Parkii (shea butter) extract, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate coplymer, caprylyl glycol, methyl methacrylate crosspolymer, squalane, aluminum starch ocentylsuccinate, methylparaben, xanthan gum, propylparaben, polysorbate 60, polysorbate 20, fragrance, disodium EDTA, ascorbic acid, succinoglycan. (May also contain citric acid)."
1,waste of money,"This product did not work for me. In fact, it made my skin worse around the eye area, which was the area I was most concerned with. I had red bags and more wrinkles under my eyes after using this for a week. I'm back to using a less expensive and less irritating collagen elastin based cream."
4,no miracles but good,"I don't expect miracles from any wrinkle cream, used entire tube. This one is light, has a hint of a slight flowery scent which I could tolerate but did not like --- hate perfumey smells especially when trying to sleep at night. Seems to help a bit with acne and wrinkles."
3,slight difference in deepness of frown line,"I've been using this product for close to 8 weeks now, going to keep trying it for another 4 to give a full set opinion. So far I've noticed a slight difference in the frown lines that start at the edge of my nose& down to the corner of my mouth. I hope it continues erase the wrinkle. No difference noticed in the line between my eyebrows yet. I will buy this product a few more times, all you need is just a bit & it goes a long way."
1,"Tender eyes, irritation, etc.","My eyes became tender with the first time I used it. My eyes then became irritated after the second day of using it. Only two applications, and it became red, itchy, and irritating. It has been three days since I have stopped using it, and my eyes are STILL itching, albeit less and less each day, but still. My doctor gave me something to stop the irritation if it continues to persist. I have never been so disappointed."
3,RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream,"My review is the same as the one for RoC deep wrinkle serum. Again, the serum would have helped MORE several years ago."
5,I love this product,I do like the Roc Retinol correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream. I use it every night and I am very pleased.
1,NOT for everyone!,"I read somewhere in some oprah publication (or somewhere LIKE that) that by 50 a female needs a retinol product. this product was a really good price on amazon and it was a ""why not?"" . This stuff dried out my skin like nobodys business. within 3 days (nights) of use I looked a good 10 years older. so, of course, I stopped and went back to the moisturizer I've been using for a long time. It took about 2 weeks to undo the damage. retinol is NOT for everyone and it certainly didn't work for me."
2,Not worth my time,I have very sensitive skin. When I tried this product I had a feeling it was going to make me break out. I went a head and tried it.i had heard and read so many great reviews on it. I ended up breaking out with it so I never got a chance to see if it works? I am going to look for this in Sensitive skin. I know ROC has products for sensitive skin but I don't think they have this exact one?
1,Read the list of ingredients,"I praised this product at first. Then I took the time to find my super-duper readers and perused the list of ingredients. At the very long end of it, I asked myself this question: ""Would I rather have wrinkles or cancer?"" I now use aloe gera gel."
1,Don't use as directed!!,Every day use with this WILL give you wrinkles!! Just way too strong!! Consider using this once a month. I used it for three days and looked like a burn victim!
5,Fantastic,I will only buy RoC skincare products from now on. I am 58 and this is the first skin care line that showed SIGNIFICANT results. My husband noticed improvement in just a couple of days! I am not joking.
3,"Some Modest Improvement, Maybe Expected Too Much","I'm mid 30's wanted to try something to address some light forehead expression lines that typically develop in late 20's-early 30's. This was my first use of an anti-wrinkle product. Depending on skin-sensitivity you can have a significant burning sensation with this stuff on, which they warn you about on the label. After a month of use I notice some modest improvement, the ultra light expression lines are almost invisible but the medium ones are still visible but slightly less pronounced, I didn't take before and after pictures of myself so this is based purely on memory. This is not some miracle product that will completely tighten your forehead but you should notice some improvement. I will try another product for comparison purposes, but for now this gets 3 stars and I would probably get it again."
3,Beauty worth the pain?,"It reallyyyyy stings.And when I put on other products on my face, it starts to sting too!I mean I have seen some progress but not too much."
5,Seek Miracles not Magic,"This is a beautiful book describing the 12 conditions for a miracle to happen. Each chapter uses plain language and illustrates why each condition must be met as a stepping stone to the next. It's back to basics with Divine Will. When you start to pray and spiritually surrender the concept, notion, and manifestation of a miracle is underway. Trust, Accept, Be Wise, and Know that communion with the Divine is miraculous."
3,Great book,I think this is a great book because it has facts about Indiansand cowboys. Once in awhile facts pop up.
3,Indian In The Cupboard,"Indian In The Cupboard was an interesting book. Omrey liked his presents he got, but he finally found the present he actually enjoyed.A magical cupboard that turns plastic or any other thingto life. When he got his Plastic Indian, he became bonded with the toy. Read this book and you'll see the adventures they face together."
5,the indian in the cupboard,"This was one of the best books i have read in my life, it was humourus, sad, and makes you think. I liked the book alot, i only read the first one and i wouldn't mind reading the second!We read the book in class and we all laughed, and cried. I thought the book was a message, saying be careful of what you think and do.I will recommend this to my teacher, as a lesson in english, to come and post a review! :)"
4,Django Reinhardt's Early Recordings,"There are a lot of repeated songs, but I guess they did that to be complete. Overall I am pleased. The quality is not perfect, but you can't expect too much from recordings this old."
5,GREAT Selections!,"This is it. At last I've found a GREAT collection of Django. This is the best I've found. It's so vibrant, so full of the great tunes and great recordings of those tunes. It has really satisfied my need for a good fix. Just want people to know it's mostly instrumental, very few vocals."
2,Not so good.,"I'm a fan of chick lit novels, but sometimes I need a little bit more substance than this provided. There wasn't much going on, and I kept on waiting for the real case of ""mistaken identities"", that was going to build the drama. When it came, I found myself groaning over the triteness. I like fun, mindless reads as much as the next person, but I want the plot to be the mindless part, not the main character. I would have found her reactions to situations much more believable if the author had indicated she was a head injury patient."
2,"Very very light reading, for very young adults","This book was OKAY, I initially picked it because I was going through the wedding planning with my own daughter and the storytook place in Austin, Texas, so I was reading for familiarreferences. Did not find as many references as I expected, andthought the book more suited to very young readers, late teensearly 20's, maybe. Not as well written as other chic lit booksI have read. Mildly entertaining. Not great, but not so badthat I couldn't finish it on a plane or, in an airport."
5,A book must read....,"If you are sincerely want to step into the path of Buddha. I will recommend you, ""Read it first.""If you've already practiced for years, but still have lots of struggles and confusions, I will recommend you, ""Read it now.""If you think you are a great Buddhist, but actually lack of mercy to others, I will recommend you, ""Read it ASAP."""
3,nice figures,"The figures in this set are good for stations, and business sections on a layout. The only short comings on this set are some of the figures are out of proportion, i.e. body, arms, and with heads and faces that look very close to punch and judy!Also several figures are actually in 1/72 scale not Ho. so the modeler will have to sort through the set and remove figures out of scale. or that would look better in a punch and judy sketch."
2,JUST CUTE,"i bought the steering wheel cover, the mats, and the CD holder to match. they were a nice asset to my interior. the steering wheel cover is cute, but it didn't last long. the hearts (which are glued on), started coming off and the material began to unravel. i drive a lot and share my car with two teenagers. this could be a factor on the wear and tear of this cover. but it fit the steering wheel perfectly and i enjoyed it while it lasted. a good product, just not very sturdy with extensive use."
5,Hearts Steering Wheel Cover,Made my car smell like new!A bit hard to put on the car..at least for a girl...but hey it's on!It looks great!
1,I THOUGHT I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN WHEN I SAW THIS MOVIE,"ON THE SHELVE AT THE VIDEO STORE.THEN WHEN I WATCHED THE FIRST TWENTY SECONDS,I REALIZED IT MUST BE HELL IM IN.I WOULD RATHER WATCH YOKO ONOS MOVIE ABOUT THE HOUSE FLY A15 TIMES A DAY ,THEN HAVE TO SIT THROUGH CHILDREN OF THE LIVING DEAD.(...)"
1,a total waste,Savini is wasted. The Living Dead concept is wasted. It's an incoherent mess. The less said about it the better.
2,the bad egg of the living dead,the first twenty minutes of this was great with tom savini kicking ass just like he did in from dusk till dawn. But when he gets killed the rest of the film is a joke i could have watched the whole lot if tom was in it he was cool i even sent an e mail to him telling him how disappointed i was in the project except his work and it had a fifteen cert i was mortified when i got it no self respecting horror movie has a fifteen cert
4,children of the living dead,"the plague is still going and its the dead vs the living this is a must have if your a big zombie fan do not pass this one up its great the fxs are wow! its nonstop action at its best and gory, the acting is good and the sets are done great"
4,ABBOT HAYESSSSSSSSS!!!!,"This movie is totally hilarious. Don't go in expecting anything but hilarity, and a bit of confusion. That way you can really enjoy the film. $6.15 used(thats the price as of this writing) is a completely acceptable price. I wouldn't pay more than $10, as it's definitely not worth that. It is, however, worth having around. Good fun."
1,too quiet & fm transmitter is lame,"I'm sorry, but this unit is a horrible mp3 player. The fm transmitter doesn't have enough power to get into ANY radio I tried, without lots of static, if at all. Also, the battery life is dismal, compared to my iriver. Also the volume doesn't go up loud enough. I'm disappointed and would not recommend this unit."
1,"Nice design, Defective execution","The ear plug jack on this product is defective. I had the same defect in 2 different units from 2 different vendors. Also, batteries don't last very long. And forget about getting any help from TrekStor"
3,"Only for the Danny Kirwan fans , but buy it anyways","I have to agree a tiny bit with Phillip's comments on this album , but this is only released for a limited time , so if you are a Danny Kirwan fan from his fine days in ""Fleetwood Mac"" buy it before it's too late. It was really sad to see him decline mentally and this album was the start, however I do think some songs on this album were good , like Ram Jam City,Second Chapter , and Falling in love with you. But the music on this album is very outdated , would only be appricated buy , Kirwan fans or those who have extreme music appriciation, (which is rare nowadays), but even they would not have thought that his solo efforts come even close to how he was in his F.M. days. But like Syd Barrett , he fell to a point of no return."
3,A bit disappointing,"Second Chapter (W/Book) (Dig)I am a huge Danny Kirwan fan. The Fleetwood Mac album ""Bare Trees"" is my desert island disc. I never tire of listening to it, mainly because of the five Danny Kirwan songs on it. I recently bought several early Fleetwood Mac albums I did not have before (the Live in Boston CDs, the Chicago recordings, etc.) and have immersed myself in them. Danny Kirwan's playing, singing and songwriting strike the right chords in me on those albums, so I was very excited about getting this CD. Unfortunately, ""Second Chapter"" is lacking in the magic that made his Fleetwood Mac material so good, possibly because the backing musicians are no match for the John McVie/Mick Fleetwood rhythm section. The songwriting also seemed uninspired. It's kind of hard to believe that the man who wrote ""Sunny Side of Heaven"" and so many other great songs would be capable of knocking out an entire album of pedestrian, unimpressive tunes."
3,One of his better performances,"The show is quite dated, but if you like Gallagher. Not quite as, do I dare, politacal, as I have seen him. Gallagher talks about Regan and smashes some fruit with a big hammer. Not a lot of thought involved, but, if you like Gallagher, you won't be disappointed. But, all in all, a pretty good bit of melon smashing"
4,"Live modern jazz with soul, circa 1960","Cannonball's quintet was close to it's peak circa October 1960 when this live date was recorded. Brother Nat, Victor Feldman, Sam Jones, Louis Hayes and the big man himself are all in fine form here.The track listed as ""Blue Daniel"" is introduced by Cannonball as ""Blue Danube"", written by Frank Rosolino, and it's an exquisitely beautiful jazz waltz melody, which Cannonball, Nat, and Victor all take fine solos on, then fades out to Sam's brief yet charming bass coda.If you have ""Mercy, Mercy (Live)"", ""Live in Chicago"", and ""Live in San Francisco"", this is the next one to get."
4,Catch up on post-Cold War politics,"Great, well written and interesting book. It's fairly easy to read, because Halberstam interjects the discussions on hard politics with lighter stories, anecdotes, and personality descriptions of the key players. I found it a great way to catch up on what I did not know about our politics and foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. Halberstam should have covered some things (e.g. Gulf War) a bit more thouroughly, but overall I was very satisfied."
5,A must read,"This is a wonderful book -- a comprehensive history of America's repsonse, and lack thereof, to the crisis in Yugoslavia. The book contains incisive biographies of the major players involved, and paints a clear picture of Clinton's hapless foreign policy and contemptible personality. The scope and level of detail is impressive. Well worth reading."
1,Simply poorly researched,"How long can Halberstam continue on reputation alone? How can anyone write a book on U.S. foreign policy that has only one non-American interviewed for this topic? I mean, it is supposed to be a book about ""foreign"" policy so wouldn't you like to know what ""foreigners"" think of this policy? Ridiculous that this even got past the editors. Stick to Robert Kaplan for any real balanced analysis of the U.S. and its relationship to other nations and cultures around the world. Halberstam has become a total joke in his old age."
3,Mail It In for Battery Replacement,"I bought mine on sale more than two years ago and was satisfied with the performance. Recommend you avoid using the alarms and light as much as possible to avoid draining the battery.When I took it to a watch shop for a new battery, they said they couldn't guarantee it would remain watertight and that was the case.I may buy another one since the price has dropped 50%."
5,Enjoyable !,"What I like about this book is that the story is concisely written, perefect for younger children who may not have long attention spans required for longer books.The illustraions are superbly rich. Even when the book is closed and in it's cute little pocket, it is a work of art. The thick pages are layered into increasing heights, resulting in a compelling 3 Dimensional treasure for both children and adults to enjoy."
2,oh why why why,"Defeat, D and D soundclash, Mic stance, mortal kombat, and Whirlwind through cities are great songs. warfare was cool at first, but it got old faster than a fast thing.but this album is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaddd. I've always liked Afu-Ra since I've heard him, and I still want to like him, and the above songs help.. but this album is so dissapointing.. if you've heard most of the above songs, don't even bother with this album. But if you haven't heard these songs, and you have alot of money to waste, maybe you should get it cause those songs are really good. The thing is you can get most of the other songs in other albums. whatever, try to hear the above songs, but beware of this album!..."
3,Fluidmaster Flapper Chain,It's a flapper chain and it does what a flapper chain is supposed to do. Not much more needs to be said.
4,Light and lively Debbie Reynolds,"Debbie Reynolds is always fun and full of life. She always delivers and with a great supporting cast, this movie is a total delight. The 20th Century Fox Classic Collection offered by Amazon is always 100% picture and sound perfect. This is good family entertainment."
3,Colors don't match,"These work great but not all of the colors match Wilton icing colors, as Wilton claims. Try before you finalize your decorations. The pink, for example, does not match other pinks; this gel is more of a salmon shade.As someone else said, these will not dry hard."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"I felt like a little kid all over again when I received this CD item! The story is very well done- you get to hear the new Whit for the first time! Awesome, awesome, awesome. Kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time, a wonderful item to add to my Odyssey collection!"
4,Shearing Piano,"An excellent blend, both types and styles of solo piano musical talents, of one of the all time great jazz musicians."
4,educational and fun,this book is not only educational but also fun to read i learned about more pyrmids than i knew exsisted
5,beautiful!,This is a really awesome bracelet and looks much better in person than in the photo.Perfect for any one who likes leather and hardware:)
2,Not worth the money,"This is NOT a good choice for a dollhouse. My daughter received this for Christmas last year (2.5yo) and it was great for oh, 3 months or so. We purchased the kitchen, living room, nursery, and bedroom set and there is NO way that even HALF of the furniture can fit inside the house with the critters. Now she wants more families (we have 3 so far) and there is just no way to do this without pure chaos. I told my husband that she is breaking so many fire codes right now ;) The critters themselves are ADORABLE (I can't recommend them enough! My daughter plays with her critters at least one hour per day!) but I would look elsewhere for a house."
4,"Quality, Timeless Fun","The Town Home is a fine addition to your Calico Critters collection. My daughter got this when she was 2 to go with the mouse family and kitchen set. She then got the baby bedroom and twins...although all of the furniture will not fit in each room, she has always had a fun and easy time playing with it. She puts some of the furniture in the rooms and then plays with a lot of it out in front...the lights are great, it's been very durable and easy for her to open/close and set up herself. Although it's smaller (there are bigger homes if you're purely concerned about space), it's a great option at this price point. She's about to turn 3 and will be getting more!"
1,SO SMALL!!!,"I bought this townhouse for my daughter last Christmas with high expectations. Man, was i disappointed!!!! Okay, it IS incredibly cute. The pictures on the box make it look perfect, and if that's all you were gonna do with it--look at it--this house would be great. But if you actually want to PLAY with it, which, i'm assuming, is essentially the purpose, then you're just outta luck with this house. There is just NO WAY to fit anything in this house....it's just too small! It's too small in 2 ways: 1) not enough rooms in the house and 2) not enough room in each room--you can't fit all your furniture in there--much less little hands. We mostly just use our Calico furniture out on our dining room table. I'd recommend purchasing a REALLY BIG doll house if you actually want to play with the Critters IN the house. Of course, Calico Critters company doesn't make ANY of their houses big enough, so you'd have to go with a completely different brand of house. That's what i plan to do."
3,"Poorly packaged, broken in transit and required a return","This was a big dissappointment for our daughter, because when we opened it, it was broken in the box, beyond repair.It was shipped without any consideration for protecting the product in transit, and was broken in numerous places.Floors were buckled inside, with the plastic cracked, the hinged sections were broken, etc.It is a shame, because otherwise it appeared to be a nice toy which she would have enjoyed very much, but due to the poor packaging design, it did not survive the shipping. If the vendor were to double box it with additional protection surrounding the product package, this could be easily solved. (If you purchase, I recommend requesting this)"
1,Not ready for prime time...,"I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception. Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves. I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least. I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer. I have been more than patient with this software. It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs. And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue. As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE."
1,Hack job from man with a personal vendetta against IBLP,"This book is a sorid attempt to discredit a Goldy man whose ministry has been a blessing to lives of millions of people, mine included. I find Mr. Veinot and Co.'s writing to be biased and dead-set on not letting the facts get in the way of their personal agendas. I was saddened to see many distortions of what Mr. Gothard's ministry (IBLP) really teachings on the principles of God's Word. Contrary to the accusations of the authors, Mr. Gothard does not teach ""cultist"" philophies, nor does he teach the rigid, unquestioning following of authority that they claim. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Go right to the source,"If you really want an accurate look at what Bill Gothard teaches, I suggest that you go directly to his website and see for yourself. He lays out what he teaches through sound biblical principle. The views he holds regarding circumcision, grace, authority and much more are available to view.Im sure that, after comparing what this book claims that he teaches and actually seeing what he teaches, you will clearly see that the authors of this book have been sadly misinformed in their portrayal of Mr Gothard. The book makes a faulty presentation through either tweaking or embellishing biblical concepts in order to give them enough error that they are rejected on the whole. This raises a question of credibility on the rest of the testimony of the book.Therefore if you choose to read this book, which I do not recommend, you will see that for whatever reason it is an inaccurate portrayal of the IBLP ministry."
1,Author exposed,"On April 11, 2003, the City of Indianapolis , issued a sharp rebuke to the media campaign in which the author of this book, Don Veinot, was involved. It stated that through investigation, by the state and the Marion County Prosecuter's office, it found that the allegations of child abuse (in which Don Veinot promoted against the IBLP training center in Indianapolis) were completely unfounded and unsubstantiated. They further endorsed the Institute's work and strongly encourage others to take advantage of the good work that they are doing in and around the city. They further stated that the IBLP was an innocent victim of these false allegations.The author of this book should apoplogize for promoting these false allegations and write a retraction. This book likewise is made up of twisted and false allegations from one that has rejected the very foundation of christian teachings.As has been mentioned before, time will reveal the real truth -hopefully not too late though."
5,My Eyes Are Opened,"I read the book, A Matter of Basic Principles, last July. I am so grateful for having my eyes opened to the truth of the IBLP ministry. I personally talked to Don Veinot as well as made phone calls to some of the persons involved in the incidents mentioned in the book. I wanted to be sure that the documentation, which is well cited by the way, was indeed accurate. As sad as I was to find out about the deception and scripture-twisting within the ministry, I will be forever grateful. A man in ministry should never be exempt from accountability. Those who are devoted to him will not even listen to the allegations brought against him, a dangerous practice indeed. All in all, the book was well written and well documented. I believe it is a must for all Christians to read and evaluate."
2,Wrong Description,"Beyond Expectations is a movie filmed in Richmond Virginia around 1997-98, produced by Mark ChingBeyond Expecations Advanced is an exercise VHS tape, one of three, (1) Beginner, (2) Intermediate, (3) AdvancedThis is the second wrong tape I have purchased through an Amazon reseller. trying to find this one title"
2,Barely nostalgic,"No, this is not THE Johnny Duncan. This is the Johnny Duncan from Huntingdon, England who was one of the progenitors of pre Beatle Britpop, in this case, in the form of skiffle music which was in itself a sort of Brit concept of American folk and C&W. Along with Lonnie Donigan's version of Rock Island Line and Cumberland Gap, Last Train enjoyed a brief stint at the top of the pop charts in the UK in the late 50s. Skiffle died shortly thereafter, placing Country and Western in the position of least listenable music for this reviewer."
3,Question for the reviewers,this is a question for the ones who've heard the cd...i've noticed that some of the songs are the same as their first albumn. Did they remake those songs..or just just use the same mixing/track from the first albumn?
5,"Great playing, wonderful production","This is the best quality instructional DVD that has ever been produced. There is so much information here that one can watch the video a dozen times and still find new things... Thomas Lang is a top player and his playing is both entertaining and inspiring, and although many exercises are very advanced there is something for everyone. If you want to learn new concepts for your feet, you should get this DVD. Or, even if you just want to improve your listening skills with lots of odd times, you should get it too. You can also get it just because you would like to be petrified by great performances. But don't miss the oportunity to view this excellent material, it's definitely worth it!"
5,Blazing comet burning out!,"This book was a revelation to me! I've always loved the strengthand delicacy of Pollock's works, without ever being able to place the undercurrent of violence and black rage in it. Now I understand. What a fascinating picture of how an artist can turnwhat to others would be crippling limitations into lasting beauty!Thank you, Martin Gray, for opening my eyes."
1,Rip Off,"This is a total RIP OFF while the add clearly says 5 pound box, what you get is a 0.5 pound tube. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
4,Very interesting book about many bicycle subjects,"Very interesting read. Includes all sorts of subjects, including using biking to battle depression, groin pain and its cause, nutrition and knee pain. You will need another book for some hard training, but this is a very good read and reference to cycle all your life."
3,The Power of Their Ideas Book Review,"I am a second year college student majoring in elementary education. I am currently enrolled in Education 2403, in which I read the book, The Power of Their Ideas. The Power of Their Ideas, by Deborah Meier, is an eye-opening book that reflects upon the teaching of lessons in a New York public school. It elaborates on the future of our public schools and the way they are changing each year. I beleive that this book is a great source for current and future educators. Deborah Meier provides the reader with the knowledge he/she should know for the future of public education. I beleive it is important to learn about the changing ways of learning and education. I would recommend this book to any current or future educator. The knowledge gained with the new and improved public education will be a big help to our educators."
5,terrific resource,"Check out this comprehensive ""how to"" on homeschooling, written by prolific author and homeschooler Ann Lahrson-Fisher. Easy to understand, you can read it from the first page to the last or simply thumb through it, using it as a resource whenever questions come up. There is plenty of information here that will apply to learners of all kinds. The author is a terrific speaker, too, and gives presentations at homeschool workshops around the United States. Go hear her speak if you get a chance!"
3,Interesting but dissapointing,"The book showed tons of promise from the outset, but it slowly sort of flowed downhill from there. I was expecting a surreal comedy but the film is a sea of surrealty and no comedy."
5,A Must Buy!,"Korn's heavy hitting new album is what all the fans have been waitingfor. Packed with 19 songs, if you get the Deluxe Version, which youshould get as it includes two music videos of live performances ofTwisted Transistor and Hypocrites. Some of my personal favorites thatmight not make it into singles include Love Song and Souvenir, sodefinitely buy the album as you might not hear these on the radio!"
4,icp clown posse the great milenko,we got three icp cds from this vender and they were all in excellent shape
2,Gone are the days of Ball Tongue,"I really miss Korn. I want the Korn that brought us Ball Tongue and Fake, Divine and Chi. The stuff that made me love Korn in the first place."
1,How to handle korn,"They are not and I repeat not a one star band, but I have cracked the ""Korn Code"" if you bought an album after the first one....your wrong! Though I will admit I got suckered into the second. Instead when you hear that ""one song"" you like... download it, in the end you will be less pissed that all the other ones suck and you spent 14 dollars on a collection of songs that you can't tell the difference in. Besides they have not had an original album since the first... Everyone is the same!"
1,i hate this album...,"this album is proof that jonathan davis has run out of good ideas. every song on here sucks and this album is just an abortion for your ears. they artwork is the now unoriginal kiddy themed artwork they always seem to do(korn, follow the leader, life is peachy, and untouchables all had kids in the artwork). i would suggest j.davis quit his bitching and play something good for a friggin change. nu metal...pssssshhh"
1,Time to let it go guys,"Korn, I'm not suggesting for you guys to give up music entirely(though it would be nice), but c'mon, its time to throw in your towel. I admit that these guys used to be my favorite band, but that was a time when I was very ignorant about music-heavy and otherwise-in general. This sounds like a hair metal band releasing an album in the midst of the grunge craze in 1993. You guys made a lot of money, be happy. Head is off pretending to be Jesus and you guys are still making bad albums. Your day is over, let it go."
1,Korn = bad music,"A friend of mine sent me four Korn songs. Though I have read the lyrics online, and liked some of the lyrics, the production, the band, the singing... they all STINK TO HIGH HEAVEN. Korn is dreadfully bad. DREADFULLY BAD. Don't waste your time with this band..."
1,Shucked Korn......is all they are now,"Whenever I was in junior high in like 94 these guys owned the metal scene. Their music was very original All the poser kids wore the korn hoodies and everything addidas and pretended to be all mad and hard and emotionally distrought, but their parents were rich doctors and stuff like that, but it was a fun time. Their music was energetic and raw. Hell, I even used to listen to Daddy in my room with the lights turned off, cause I thought it was evil sounding and scary, but then again I was like 12. So now I'm 25 and they just don't do it for me anymore. This album is TERRIBLE!!! I use it as a coaster for my coffee table, it matches my couch. When issues came around I heard the beginning of the end. Why did they have to go and experiment with rapid pads and all those other computer generated annoying sounds? It seemed like the more weight Johnathan Davis gained, the worse their music got."
1,IM THE ONE THATS COMING UNDONE!,"WTF?? this cant be happening! what the hell is going on with korn? heavy metal bands have started to sell out or quit at an alarming rate! korn is the most recent sell out! i never thought korn would sell out, but i was painfully wrong. for the record, i have loved all six of korn's records. and for the record, i have waited almost three years for this piece of s**t record!!!!!! this record sounds like a pop album. and brian's absence is extremely noticable. korn is sadly dead and there is nothing i can do about it. i noticed that korn was taking a big risk with take a look in the mirror. it was still good, but it was falling away from what korn was and will never be again. if jon reads these reviews, i hope he gets to this one!!! what the hell is wrong with you??? since when did you become a pop star??? i'm sorry i wasted my money on such a record! ANYONE WHO LIKES THIS RECORD IS A FAN OF POP MUSIC!! THEY ARE NOT HEAVY METAL FANS!!!! R.I.P. KORN!"
2,"Good, but missing the ""korn""","As a HUGE Korn fan I couldnt help but be disappointed with this album. i hear too much linkin park and p.o.d. and i hate both bands. Worth having for the collection, but nothing like korn before Head left... but hopefully this doesnt start the downfall of korn. Rock on."
2,garbage,"I've been a Korn fan since day one. There first cd is there best...yadayadayada....but every one of their cd's beyond that was really good in there own way. I loved Take a Look in the Mirros. Now everyone is praising them because their ""reinventing"" there sound..pssh...yah...that's great if it sounds good. This sounds like s*it...pure and simple.Aside from maybe 4 songs on this album, the rest was pure-filler. I've listened to it like 4 times, trying to perhaps gain a greater sense of respect for it. But eh-eh...not happening...and to say that i'm giving it a s*itty review because it's not as heavy as there other stuff is wrong. I actually thought tearjerker was one of, if not the best song on the album. Very dissapointing."
1,wow! amazingly bad...,"this album was bad, so bad i just had to register to explain how bad this album is. I had very low expectations for this album, the biggest news surronding this release was their new deal with virgin records (woohoo). Jonathan davis sounds absolutley awful, his lyrics could have easily been written by any emo high school kid you would see on myspace. The guitars on this album sound the same, korn is truely dead and this album just proved it. No doubt all the blind korn fanboys will eat this up, while their original fanbase has long since moved on. Truely sad attempt from korn."
1,Nu Crap!!!!!,"This is probably the worst album I've heard in my Life!!!!What a waste!!!!! Many years ago KORN defined a genre (Nu Metal).With this release they defined another one,..... NU CRAP!!!!!!"
1,This band has NOT always been mediocre.,"I still remember how original and amazing the singls ""BLIND"" was when I first heard it many years ago. This new album... and a others before it... ugh. This is what I would expect ""In Flames"" (search them on Amanzon if you aren't in the know) would probably sound like if they ever ""sold out"" (and i doubt they will, but don't quote me on that). I don't see much oroginal here. Different direction for Korn... okay. I can see that. Original sound NO WAY----NOT IN A MILLION YEARS. Why can't bands stick to their guns? In the long run---the endurance makes fame--AND MONEY. Perhaps the short path brings big money quickly, but dying young isn't something many people dream of."
2,Dissapointed Old school Korn fan,"I must say that I am really disappointed with this CD. I just bought and after listening to it for less than an hour, and had to stop. I do understand that bands need to evolve and that the days of their first album and of Peachy will not ever come back, but this is not what I expected at all. I expected some changes in the sound, thanks to Head leaving, but that was it. The whole dynamic of their song writing process have changed. I do not feel the connection I used to feel when they were my all time favorite band. New Korn fans will probably appreciate it, because it is not bad musically. It still has some hard riffs and the music is ok, but the lyrics are not there."
2,Master Lock 379DAT Universal Coupler Lock,"This is a nice, well-made coupler lock, HOWEVER YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT IT WILL FIT YOUR COUPLER BEFORE BUYING IT. It is NOT UNIVERSAL!"
5,I'm so glad I bought this on amazon.com,"There's actually 4 records: 1977's Remember My Name, a soundtrack she wrote the songs for apparently and sang when she was 82, her first release since her last record, I guess, at age 62. Her second album is Amtrak Blues from 1978 age 83, then The Glory of Alberta Hunter 1981 age 86 and, finally, Look for the Silver Lining from 1982 at age 87. There is also a CD called Downhearted Blues Live at the Cookery. She also has another live release Jazz live at the Smithsonian. Yow.Her voice is so wonderful at this later age. Similar, to me, with Johnny Cash where I prefer his voice in his last decade much more than his first 2 or 3 decades. Same with Alberta Hunter. I don't really care for her work from the 20's through 40's. But this stuff is stunning. She has so much gusto and presence and to have the chance to see her live show here is a real treat. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
4,lightweight London adventure story makes for perfect summer reading,"'London Bridges' by Jane Stevenson is certainly a very competent novel. The characterizations are rather humorously well drawn, and the whole feel of this lightweight mystery reflects modern London life extremely well also. Oh, the story is comedy-mystery that winds up being almost farcical. This is the sort of book one reads for the atmosphere, not for the plot. It has the feel of British television mini-series that leaves a smile on your face.Bottom line: a pleasing read for those who know and love London."
3,Disk Array does the job,I am happy with the product but it does have room for improvement in the manner in which the door/latch closes and locks. It is not designed as well as Addonics single hard drive rack which I own.
1,biased and out of date,"This book casts as scientific fact that which is merely theory - and highly dubious theory at that. Its contribution to the debate over climate change is highly questionable and it is probable that its main purpose is to advertise the ill-founded claims of Greenpeace that the world is about to come to an end. Furthermore, it is now considerably out of date, as much new scientific evidence has come to light which makes the contentions in this book of little merit other than as a historic example of an attempt to pervert the course of science in the interests of creating anti-capitalist regulations."
2,Unfortunately recycled from another Frontline special,"I had originally watched Frontlines 2 part series about the lead up to the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. This can be viewed on Netflix streaming, which is roughly 4-5 hours of interviews and evidence in regards to these wars. So due to this documentary, I was quite intrigued and wanted to get this as well. I was expecting this to be something more, something that delved more into Cheney himself.Unfortunately, the footage from this is 90% from the other documentary, and the remaining 10% is just seconds extra of the interviews, and a few extra interviews cobbled together with some different video footage. Kind of a let down considering they sold this for this much, and it is mostly just a rehash of another documentary already out there."
3,Good Value,"I needed to buy a cheap Toaster Oven, Proctor Silex are good value for the money, and you get what you pay for. it is not going to last long and probably will discolor(I have bought one before) and it serves my purpose."
3,Toaster Oven Review,I find the directions for getting the oven to work very confusing. I have yet to cook anything that hasn't been burned or hasn't been undercooked. Since other reviews on this product have been so good I'm assuming it's the cook and not the product.
1,Casio customer service,"I have had problems with this product, I have contacted Casio twice about it and still no responce. Poor customer service and tech support. I don't think I would reccommend this product."
5,Great thing to have,"I'm using a braball for 6 months now and I have to say I'm very happy I got it. It would be great if they would make also bigger braballs. This one fits A and B cups. I do not think you can fit C cup inside. I wash 1 bra at the time, I never put 2 bras inside."
1,Bras Don't Get Washed Well,My wife bought these as a gift but would not recommend it as bras are not washed well. Don't buy...waste of your money!
4,BraBall,"The BraBall saves time (no hand laundering)and helps bras retain their shape, which makes them last longer. I only wish it was a little less in price and/or available in retail stores in the Chicago area."
4,Pretty good invention... But note this:,"I have had one for 2 weeks and it works great so far. I have one of those vertical load washers with an agitator in the middle and need to force the ball to fit it in. The diameter of the ball is over 6"" so make sure it will clear going inside your washer before you buy it! The ball is blue (as shown) but the manufacturer warns that with time it will fade to white. While this process is supposed to be safe for your laundry why not just make it in white right away?"
3,tedious,"In my opinion, the story told in ""Her Mother's Daughter"" is a good one, and probably accurately represents the immigrant family's experience through several generations, but... I thought the book was WAY too long. It goes into excruciating detail about things like how each batch of laundry was done (I get it; it was very difficult and time-consuming to have to do laundry in the days before washing machines.) The constant switching between narrators and stories was also distracting. I thought that Anastasia, in particular, was whiny. Just my two cents."
5,It's hard to imagine!,I have always known that women were a minority race. This book brought it more to the light to me. I have only a few pages left but I know that I love this book and how it makes me think of the women in the past and all that they were up against!While reading I would get so angry and life's circumstances and men and women's roles in it. I don't know how the women did it! But I see it is still there - in the air! Men and Women! And I still get angry! And I know that I have those women to thank for the opportunity to say No! when I feel like it. Great book!
2,Not Rodgers and Hammerstein,This is not the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical of the same name. Just thought I'd let you know so you didn't make the same mistake I did.
1,The author got it all wrong!,"I was born and raised in Russia. I moved to the United States when I was nineteen years old. I reviewed this book out of curiosity. The author, most likely a Russian immigrant in second or third generation, got it all wrong! Author's ignorance about Russian traditions is truly amazing! I found errors on every page, virtually in every paragraph! Anyone who will read this book will get a completely twisted understanding of Russian culture, traditions and recipes!"
4,My Second Parker Novel,"I find Parker to be the ultimate Noir protagonist. However, he is a bit one-dimensional. But maybe that's Westlake's intent. Friends who recommended this series tell me Westlake fleshes Parker out in subsequent books. I ordered the next two in the series and look forward to discovering Parker's development as a protagonist."
1,Won't run,"Before you buy this game, I'd recommend you read through the Forum for Spellforce and see just how many people are having problems with it not running. My system exceeds the requirements and I even have an nVidia card, but it won't run. I tried downloading the 29Meg patch and it gives an error and closes so fast I can't even see what the error is.Very poor quality software in my opinion to have this many people being unable to use it."
3,Good gamebut No Support for Tech Problems,"I found that the combination of RPG/RTS was interesting but the game is buggy. After installation and uploading of lots of patches it still is graphicly jerky and reduntent in the ""teleporting"". Loads slow as well. Do not look to get quick tech support or answers. Best source is the Forum, if not a posted problem you can get an answer in a week or so."
1,sicko,I sent one message which I don't know if it got through or not but I was very displeased about SLIT FACED WOMAN . There are no subtitles and I don't understand Japanese. Also where is ZOMBIE DEAD?
5,Willie Nelson and Sheryl Crowe Steel the Show,"What a pleasant surprise when we discovered a treasure on the first song, ""If I Were a Carpenter"". The best thing about this album is its authenticity and pleasing production. The singers don't have to scream to be heard over the music. Can't wait for volume 2. As you know, Johnny Cash left a list of 100 songs...can't wait for the next album. John & Janet"
4,Anchored In Love,"I'm not usually into ""tribute"" albums, preferring to hear the originals sung by the originals, but this album is an exception. The artists chosen to cover June's songs reflected the tone of each. I especially enjoyed Carlene Carter's version of ""Jackson."" (I suppose a daughter would do her mother proud!) Overall this album is a delight to listen to --- you'll probably find yourself singing along . . . or at least humming. This album is a treat."
4,Coaster fun,"Our Pediatrician has a coaster very similar to this one in his office. So I knew it would be safe. However, the only thing I fault with this one is that it is not very big."
1,Poorly made - breaks easily,I have replaced the blade assembly three times in this blender. The plastic gears have broken on each one. I cannot recommend this blender to anyone. Look for a blender with metal gears if you want durability.
1,Broke after 10th use,"I received this Black and Decker Crush Master Blender 2 years ago as a wedding gift. I maybe used it 10 times, tops. I only made several smoothies with NO ice, and pureed some soft squash soups. Last night I was pureeing a soup and all of the sudden black plastic pieces started to fly from the connection of the glass jar and base. The metal blade has completely stopped spinning. The blender made a horrible noise. Completely broken. I always attached it correctly and washed and maintained the blender well. Horribly made with cheap plastic parts. Never even got the chance to test out its ""ice crushing"" abilities..."
2,Misguided buyer,"We found this logging truck by typing in BRIO. So we thought it a BRIO put together truck such as our grandson enjoys. When it came just before Christmas we discovered too late that there was nothing BRIO about it. We were disappointed. BRIO makesgood stuff, this did not meet their standards..."
4,Tenba Shootout small backpack,"A very nice bag, exactly what I was looking for to carry my camera equipment. This was the perfect size for a single camera setup, 2 camera bodies will fit, but it can get tight in a hurry, especially if an external flash and a med.telephoto lens, and other odds and ends are added to the mix. I'm very happy with this purchase."
4,Another Smash on Billboards' Club Play !,Bette's lastest flirtation with dance music comes in form of this Kirsty MacColl penned classic. Featuring 7 remixes all different to the version featured on the album 'BETTE'. The remixes are all a cross between hard house and salsa. My favourite mixes would be the more radio friendly tracks 1 & 5.It will keep you moving and dancing to the original disco diva and soul queen for hours to come. Total FUN and gosh doesn't she look simply DIVINE in the shoes she's pictured wearing on the single sleeve ...
5,Quick Release Pins for a custom project,"I was looking for a quick release pin for a special project to be used on my Motorcyle. I've done several searches for products from various vendors/companies that make this stuff. There are just so many choices and sizes. Jergens just happens to make the sizes I wanted in stainless and aluminum without me needing to do a custom order. Got these in and they blew me away with their quality. I've bought some other quick lock pins in the past but they could not hold up to the applications I was using them in. These do a great job and also look good as well. A little pricey but worth it. For my application their strength is more than sufficient and everything else is a bonus. I ordered 2 and it looked like they came from different vendors since the packaging was completely different, but the items in the packaging were identical. Recommended if this size fits your application."
5,Kids Enjoy this CD!,I use this CD with my special needs students. They enjoy the soothing sounds of the steel pans. Great music activities to use with or with out instruments. Knote
2,A Little Light on the Steel Drums,"Nice music, relaxing, etc. but not a lot of steel drum sound to it. Mostly guitar with background. Don't expect party dancing kind of music."
1,Not learning any math here,"As other reviewers have said, this book is verbose and teaches little math. Sometimes in Sunday papers, I read these accounts of chess matches. These can be entertaining, even w/o an understanding of the chess moves. This book is like those columns. It's describes math, but doesn't teach it. In fact, the few pages devoted to actual math are in a small font & are quite terse."
1,Calculus crushed to death by weight of the English Language,"Berlinsky simply tries too hard to wax poetic. He needed to decide at the outset, is this a math book or a rhapsody in the key of Calculus? He waxes and digresses, seduced by his own overwrought prose which takes him places I'm sure his mother warned him about and I suspect very few readers followed him. I was game enough to tag along for 100 pages out of respect for the subject, but could hold my nose no longer. Where were the man's editors for God's sake?"
3,"great book, but there's a mistake","great book and actually a fun way to learn about the calculus. there is a mistake in the chapter on ""some famous functions."" berlinski introduces the reader to exponential functions with the al-ishaqui's story of the grain of wheat on the chessboard then doubles it....berlinski later say's that it would be represented by 2^64. not true. if the first of 64 squares has 1 grain of wheat...that must be 2^0 and therefore the 64th square must have 2^63 grains."
1,Maybe the worst writer of prose ever!,"I bought this book expecting a great read that would elaborate on the history and the beauty of calculus. Instead I got one of the most pretentious and out-of-touch books ever written. The only joy I got from this book was reading passages to my roomates laughing out loud. I still reference this book in conversations years later as the worst book I ever read.One chapter sums up the book better than I ever could: ""Yo."" Berlinski decides to explain irrational numbers using a proof that the square root of 2 is not a rational number. To do this, he says: ""The ancient proof is unassailable and proceeds with the irritating authority of a waking nightmare, one of those squalid episodes, say, in which a disheveled taxi driver, unshaven and no-necked, turns and addresses you insolently, but with perfect and disturbing confidence. . ."" He then LITERALLY has the cabbie spout out the proof using ""yo""s and ""chief""s to give it that ""real"" feel."
1,A book with no audience,"A dilettante can't gain by this book. In the author's baroque style, the math message is lost on the uninitiated. A mathematician, on the other hand, may have an uneasy feeling trying to decipher the author's intended meaning at the flourishes the book is replete with. Two examples from a single page (18) bring the problem to the fore:""...but in mathematics distance is defined by reference to a space of some sort and is thus a concept that requires, among other things, a fixed point..."" (A.B.: needing a fixed point is a clear misnomer.)""The number 10 is, after all, nothing more than ten of those 1,s; and with the number 100,000, it is more of the same - 1's strung out as far as the eye can see."" (A.B.: What's then 1,000,000? Andwhat's to make it different from 10,000,000? Should one climb the Everest to make it possible to count that far?)The book is absurd; the back cover reviews by The New York Times and SF Chronicle are utterlymisleading."
3,The trick is ....,"I've read alot of these reviews here, and will have to go back to the bookstore to re-read the thing again - now that I've heard all this stuff about it being poorly written. The trick to reading it is to do it in about 40 minutes. Don't actually read what he writes - don't get caught up in the prose, just skim. For those versed in math, it's a good skim; for those not so versed, read all these reviews."
2,"this is a book about Berlinski, not about calculus","If Berlinski's literary talent was only half as big as his ego then he would have been a good writer. Unfortunately, that is not the case. It was not bad enough to confuse the readers with awkward explanations of math concepts but he had to make us endure his pompous prose and annoying literary interludes. Add to this open contempt for the readers and you will get a book for masochists.What people other than masochists will tolerate an author to tell them that he feels sorry for them because they can not comprehend a particular mathematical theorem? This on top of having to endure his amateurish attempt to write prose.I read the book several years ago."
2,Self-indulgent,"Low on information density. Digressions into author's school life and lectures in Eastern Europe add nothing to the understanding of the topic.Truly good material available in the story of development of The Calculus, especially in the conflict over precedence between Newton and Leibnitz. But its lost in this book"
2,Not enough Rob for me,"I saw this CD on the shelves for months and finally decided to just go ahead and get it. I was so disappointed because I was expecting not only a Rob biography, but also some interviews with Rob himself. This DVD was all from the 3rd party aspect. Rob's school teachers, drama teachers, people from his neighborhood, etc. I don't mind a little bit of info from other people, but what I really want is to hear Rob's story coming from Rob himself! There was literally no interviews at all with Rob in this DVD. I actually got bored with it, which should say something because usually anything having to do with Rob has my full and utmost attention. I've had the CD for 4 months now and still haven't finished watching it all the way through....It's bad people, but since I collect all things Twilight and/or Rob, it makes a nice addition for my display case."
1,True Rob Fan? Boycott this DVD.,"This dvd is not approved by Rob Pattinson or his management. They are cashing in on Rob's fame. You can find the material online and shouldn't waste your money. The Haunted Airman is also available online and is sold officially by the studio who produced it. This dvd is a SCAM and is as bad as the tabloids that spread lies about Rob. If you're truly Robsessed, you'll know NOT TO BUY THIS DVD. Support Rob and boycott stuff like this that takes advantage of his fans."
1,Saddened,I am dissallusioned how a company can blantantly steal from Rob Pattinson FanSites and advertise this as their own creation/dvd. Do not give money to these thieves!Please do not buy this!
1,Don't Waste Your Time!!,"I saw this dvd in a store and bought it right away, as I consider myself 'Robsessed'.... evidently not enough to want to sit through watching this dvd a second time. As other's have reviewed, it is only interviews with people who tell you their opinion of Rob from the few moments they interviewed him in past years. All you see of Rob is still photos that are flashed across the screen during the mind numbing chatter of these people. I wish I had read these reviews before I opened it and watched it, so I could have taken it back to the store."
1,Do not buy this DVD!!,"Do NOT waste your money on this DVD. They're just trying to cash in on Rob. This being an unauthorized biography, most (if not all) of the stuff on there can be found online FOR FREE. Check out YT for videos... blogs for more info...Oh, and these guys steal. Blatantly, shamelessly, plainly STEAL. Not cool!"
2,not much to be gained if a loyal fan,"This DVD (which I watched from Netflix) lived up to the many one star reviews. It had no real new content or interviews from anyone on the twilight set (directors or stars). The main ""sources"" of information were these british writters, Virginia Blackburn (who is writing a bio on Rob in November) and some people from the Barnes Theater and the Bad Mother's Handbook (which is an English film). The poriton on the Barnes theater is the only thing saving this from being a 1 star.Recommended instead for information:Youtube for interviews.Various fan webstites.Life Story- Robert Pattinson (magazine).Vanity Fair and Harper's Bazzar December 2009 (recent magazine interviews)Recommendation on this DVD: Avoid."
1,Nothing You Haven't Already Seen. Why Spend $18 When You Get Rob Info Online for FREE?,"Being a true fan. It upsets us that companies would want to milk the situation and profit from it. Several reviews have stated that this DVD has NO personal interviews with the subject, and has mostly second/third-hand information. We don't want to hear about what other people want to say about him. We want to see and hear the real deal. Besides, there are a lot of bootleg copies online, so we'll probably just torrent it. OR get it for free, and burn multiple copies of it, and distribute it FOR FREE... :D So, unless Rob Pattinson gets royalties from the MILLIONS of dollars this dvd will make from clueless fans, consider this NOT SOLD.STOP MAKING MONEY OFF OF POOR ROB."
1,Very Low Act...,"It's apparant that in this day and age of the internet it is easy to steal or copy others works and claim them as your own. It's seems as though this is exactly what has been done with this DVD. There are some fantastic Rob dedicated sites out there and they do it for the love of Rob, not for profit. Is Robert Pattinson even getting any money from this DVD? I should hope that others will boycott this DVD. Readers of this, keep supporting the fans who dedicate their life to bringing us fun things to do with Robert for the love of him, not for profit."
4,"Great research, poor structure","Pappas' reasearch is very engaging. Yes King did steal his most famous essays and speechs and back his theory up with hard facts.On reviewer on this cite insisted that King's doctoral thesis reads similar to Jack Boozer's but does not rise to plagiarism. As Pappas points out, when Boozer cites a quote from Tillich he mis-cites page 282 istead of page 252. An honest mistake. But King aslo cites page 282 rather than 252. Clearly the two did not mis-cite the quote by mere coincidence.Pappas' only problem is that he does not use this book to break down King in whole. I'm still amazed that King and Jesus are the only two people honored with national holidays.I too was brought up to admire King. However after researching his life I find nothing about it worth celebrating. In fact I find him as being the source of many of our race problems today. The book should have focused on debunking King in whole...."
3,You don't get much for $25,"I ordered this Timex since no nearby stores carry it. I was surprised when it arrived how small it is. The Indigo back lighting works fine, the band is a bit flimsy but it works for me."
1,Band is cheap,"I didn't wear it often, but the band just broke after a few months. The band was pretty flimsily. It's advertised as leather, but only only the top layer is leather. Wish I'd bought a different watch:-("
2,even with the good reviews....,"This book had good reviews but i don't know why but it bored me, just my experienceMaybe I wan't in the mood for the book but I just could not get into it. when i get into a good book i will stay up all night to finish it. this one well never finished it.but if you think you may like it please don't let this review sway you either way maybe it was my mood that day or just notmy cup of tea"
4,a solid product,"I use this product daily, and find it easy to use, convenient size, and was easy to assemble."
1,HORRID BOOK,"THIS IS A SELF PROFITING SALESMAN ATTEMPTING TO CASH IN ON SELLING HIS PRODUCTS. IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE ""SUPERFOOD"" DRINK WHEATGRASS. AN ARROGANT MENTAL CASE WHO IS FULL OF HIMSELF WITH MAIL ORDER DIME-A-DOZEN NON-CREDENTIALS. THIS IS A BOOK THAT FULL ON NOTHING TANGIBLE EXCEPT THE INAPT WRITER AND HIS EGO."
2,Poetic and mellow - but she's done better,"Ani DiFranco's poetry is always beautiful and insightful. What is lacking in this CD is her charismatic energy and variation of music within a collection. The songs are uncharacteristically similar and many of the soft beats are uninspiring. Each of Ani's albums are different and wonderful in their own right, but this fan expected something else and something more - not 2 CDs worth of music to fall asleep by."
2,"Clunky, self-indulgent, and boring","I guess I'm regrettably and officially sick of Ani DiFranco. Have been a fan for years, but Revelling/Reckoning is nothing to get even vaguely excited by. She's moved into sort of a funky free-jazz vibe, kind of like a chick version of Spinal Tap Mark Two, I guess. Her songs are now filled with funk fills, stuttering lyrics, and other messy-sounding bits of trivia. Are there a few decent tunes? Yep. ""Gray"" is wonderfully understated bit of depression. After a good dozen listens, it's the only tune that sticks with me. Everything she's ever done before has been better, and I suspect that everything she'll ever do from now on will be worse. 'Tis a mighty shame."
1,tedious political ranting makes my feet sad,"admittedly, this is from a first listening during which I skipped most of the tracks after 30 seconds, but what I like about ani is her attitude and her frankness; what I really dislike about her is her tedious doctrinaire leftist politics. The first thing I hear when I listen to this disk is this politics, in my face. Eye'm an anarchist individualist myself, eckchelly, and this makes the disc pretty much unlistenable for me."
3,"Same Ani, Different Style","'Revelling/Reckoning' is not Ani's best work, nor will it be her most memorable (I'm sure Ani ""purists"", if you will, will agree with this), but it does stand out in its own rite. R/R is showing us that Ani is diversifying. It is not the angry chick folk/rock that we are accustomed to with her previous CDs, but it's still our Ani, only...well, diversified. The ""purists"" may warm somewhat to the second CD, 'Reckoning', as it's more of a display of classic Ani than the 'Revelling' side.In the grande scheme of things, this is an enjoyable record. ""Ain't That the Way"" is one of the memorable tracks, as is ""Your Next Bold Move."" There are also some instrumentals thrown in, which are excellent. To the ""purists,"" just keep an open mind, and you just might enjoy this. If this is your first taste of Ani, I definitely recommend checking out some of her older CDs."
5,Her best yet,"i am a brand new ani difranco fan after listening to ""not a pretty girl"" and ""out of range."" i don't understand how i've been a music lover and have never listened to her before last summer. she is an incredible songwriter. i picked up her latest two cds which got away from her folk roots a bit, but ""revelling/reckoning"" takes you back there and combines her newest style of funk and rock and rolls it up into a genuinely ingenious double record. ex-ani fans, get to the stores and see that she's back with a vengeance. new ani fans, you've got to grab this one. her lyrics are tighter, the songs are well constructed, and the production is incredible. the horn sections add so much to the songs...i can't say enough good stuff about it. i never write reviews on websites, but i felt i had to to praise ""reckoning/revelling."""
3,"Only the sampler, but","I picked up the 10 track promo in cardboard slipcover for Ani DiFranco's Revelling / Reckoning 29 song double album. If you need an into to Ani's lovely voice and intricate music, this would be one for you to sample. Found her use of the horns section on the tracks very intriguing, and complement her acoustic guitar work. You lovers of the indie and folk genres should have this in your collection."
3,Good and greater,"3 1/2As with most of her releases, DiFranco's masterful acoustic touch is tempered with awkward genre experiments and overly ambitious delivery, but despite the glut of filler--or failure--you would think exists within these conditions, our folk femo hero manages to follow up a hit-and-miss first disc with some solidly sincere songwriting."
4,"What a crazy, great album!","This is one of the strangest, funkiest, coolest albums I've heard it a long, long time, and definitly my favorite of all of Ani's albums. It seems like for a few years she's been dabbling with sort of fusion music, jazzy and funky, stuff that can't really be defined. And it didn't always work as well as it does here.The way it all comes together, the trumpets and clarinets and Maceo's sax with her rough guitar is just really excellent. I'd recommend this album to any of Ani's fans, and to just about anyone.By far, my favorite song is the opening track of revelling. ""Ain't that the way"" is a song I'd heard her play in concert that I really liked, but I figured it was off of one of her earlier albums that I didn't have--but it's a really great way to start off the album: all those flutes and trumpets, it's so crazy.So in my opinion, this is a really great work from her, and I'm excited to hear her tour with it if I'm lucky enough to get the chance!"
3,It's What You're Looking for that Matters,"Her words stand their own among Elvis Costello and Stuart Murdoch, and her subtle guitar mastery is among the most tasteful and effective in the past 20 years. So it's a given that she's one of the best songwriters ever. But with Revelling/Reckoning, it's what you're looking for that matters. I look at it as two albums, and my three star rating is an average between the two--1 star for disc one and 5 stars for disc two. If you want experimental Ani DiFranco with excessive production and excessive cheese, you might want to try disc 1 (I can't stand to listen to it). But if you want to experience the high point so far of her lyrical career, disc 2 is it. Don't expect to tap your feet. But expect poignant, precise, and persuasive language, mastery of the slow folk form, and an idea of how much this woman has grown and improved. Disc 2, at least, is something that you must listen to. Throw Disc 1 in the trash. Revelling/Reckoning will still be a bargain."
2,Great start!,"The book started well, with author describing his early life, and escape to freedom. Later, he describes his efforts to educate the general population about slavery. However, since he didn't talk about what he said, but about how the meeting went, and who assisted (or hindered) him, after awhile it just seemed like a bunch of facts, not the heart of what he had to say. It's clear he's articulate, and passionate, but that seems to get lost somewhere, at least for me."
5,I love this song!,"I heard of Willa Ford before I knew her music. See, I'm a big BAckstreet fan and my friend and I knew her as Nick's evil girlfriend from hell. There's all these anti-Willa web sites with bad things about her. But once I heard her music I knew she was a great singer. I couldn't believe I used to hate her just because she dated a BAckstreet Boy. My friends still hate her because of all those bad things on the web sites, but I think that's stupid. Its stupid to listen to some group's music hoping they'll marry you or something. So to all those anti-Willa fans, just give her a chance. Its ok to hate her because of her music but don't hate her because her only crime was dating Nick Carter."
1,A cool song...too much like Brit though,"When i first heard this song n seen the video on TRL,it was more of a copy-cat 'i wanna be Britney thang' but thats ok cause i LOVE Britney Spears!! This song is fun,and the video is alright little too MUCH skin showing but its alright if ur a guy.Which iam not Willa seems REALLY nice,and her voice is sordof like Mandy Moore and Britney together.Overall i like this song and i like Willa!! So as a die hard Brit fan with a good heart.......Willa will become the next pop princess,with this song and will make it up there in my book. She reminds me just alittle too much of Britney though,with her video n how she comes off as a person,but there is nothing wrong with another wannabe blonde now is there!!!! I do like Willa dont get me wrong,but she needs to just go with another flow with her bad self......."
3,Nice Try!,"Co-written with KNS (Big Pun, Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz)& produced by Brian & Josh - perfectly sums up Ford's tell-it-like-it-is worldview, though the songwriter is determined to ensure that her words are not misunderstood."
4,Peaceful Journey,"I use this while riding my indoor bike. This has nature sounds, which I prefer over music. It feels a bit weird, like you're floating like an alien, but the scenery and serenity quickly get you past that."
5,This is a book to love and cherish,"Since I started learning botanical illustrating I have seen many books on the subject but few have held me spellbound like this one. The intelligence, helpfulness and sensitivity of the instructions would make it a book worth having on their own, but the glorious illustrations will keep you referrring to the book again and again. Their complexity and detail will hold you enthralled."
1,Disappointing,"I purchashed this CD remix single thinking it was a medley of the original songs, but it turns out it is just Prince remaking his old hits and blending them together. It's a little deceitful that it doesn't say on the CD that these are re-recorded versions. Very disappointing."
3,this is much Like his last few years of Concerts,this is pretty much like his Concerts real Choppy&a Hit&Miss take on his Work.interesting parts in places but it does a Dis-Service to his Talent.Sadly he seems headed toward Elvis-Vegasville.
4,Decent headphones for hte price,"This is my second purchase of these headphones. They give good sound, and because of the low price, I don't mind using them while working out when sweat might work its way in and corrode things. Volume control is good.Three complaints, one maybe not always applicable: 1) the foam pads come off too easily -- makes it irritating when pulling out of a pocket or backpack; 2) the frame could be a little wider; I find that the frame touches my head and doesn't allow the earpieces to sit firmly on the ears. This could be an unusual problem due to head shape. They might fit you fine. 3) The cord seems unnecessarily long and can be a hassle if you're wearing the phones while working or working out."
2,Don't waste your money,"Looks cool in the pics but the overall quality is about as good as a toy gun you'd buy at the gas station. I have a feeling if I ever drop it on a hard surface, it will crack to pieces. Not sure the trigger link is going to last through many more boxes of plinking ammo. The scope mount is too far above the barrel to accurately hit targets varying from 25 to 75yds without constant adjustment."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you like ""Damn Right, I've Got The Blues"", ""Feels Like Rain"" or any of the Junior Wells and Buddy Guy songs, you will be very, very disappointed with this CD. This is not the Buddy Guy I love. It's awful!"
1,I'd rate this 0 stars if that was a choice,"I have been, and will continue to be a huge Buddy Guy fan. I think I own everything he has ever done that is commercial available. I've also seen him live maybe half a dozen time. That said, I would not recommend this recording. There is almost nothing on this CD that works well. The song selection is poor or at best not suited well for BG. The recording and production are poor to average and the performance is at best mediocre. I appreciate BG's desire to record old roots-blues, but his performance style just doesn't lend itself well to this music. Simply stated, this is one of the worst CD's I've bought in years. If your looking to get started with BG, do yourself a favor and get ""Damn Right, I've Got The Blues"" or ""The Very Best..."" and skip ""Sweet Tea""."
3,Too much like rock,When I listen to this I hear Hendrix. Just doesn't cut it for me. I was hoping for electric blues not rock blues. The lyrics were great but just didn't go for the choice of the music. Sorry.
4,"Really Good, but not Great","Being an avid Buddy Guy fan, I was very excited for this release. Especially to hear Guy perform music that is different than the blues we hear today. Right after I purchased the album, I was not a fan. But then, in conjunction with an American Music course I took, I developed an immense appreciation for this album. It was difficult for me to appreciate it at first because I did not know that what Guy was playing was the original blues sound, the country-blues. Once I understood that the context of the songs and music to be different, I was able to really enjoy this album. If you try to compare it to 90's Guy, you probably won't like it. But if you enjoy it for what it is, down home hillcountry blues with an unrefined sound, then it will most likely be a great buy!!!"
1,absurd,i cannot believe that Gavin Rossdale had any part in the compilation of this cd. The pure notion is absurd.
2,Nostalgia is all this has going,"Sorry, but this is pretty awful overall. The animation and sound are terrible, the dialogue is worst and there's no real sense of pace to the episodes. The only thing they have going is nostalgia and years of fantastic X-Men comics to work with for plots and characters. I don't know if it gets any better in the subsequent volumes, but this one's just plain bad. Buy it only if you want a few laughs at a very cheesy 90s cartoon."
5,X-Men,"The animation isn't the greatest but the stories are terrific and you really care about the characters. It is a comic book translated to visuals. I remember watching this on Fox Saturday mornings, video taped them but it is nice to have them in a permanent form. Fun for all. I can't remember any cartoon that made the female characters -- i.e., Storm, Rogue and Jean Grey -- so sexy! Wow! Good fun for all!"
3,"It's nice to finally have, but needs to be what the fans want!","I agree that, while it is really awesome to finally have this amazing cartoon on DVD after what seems like a 1000 years, it should have been done right. Disney had ample time to clean up and remaster this cartoon. Just look, for example at what they were able to do for the release of their other classics like Pinnochio and such. Those movies are decades old compared to X-Men that was out only some 15 years ago. Disney/ Buena Vista should know better than this. At the same time I am very happy to finally have these and even though I prefer a cleaner version it still looks and holds a type of nostalgic quality for me. 3 out of 5."
5,Great and fascinating book for young and old!!!,"I just got my wonderful UNIVERSE. The book explains it all, from the creation of the tinniest particles at the beginning of time to the massive galaxies that surround us. I got the paperback binding due to previous reviews and find the paperback more handy than the massive hardcover edition I saw at the bookstore. Even though it looks better, this edition rocks. The paper and images are simply amazing. You can spend hours just looking at the graphics and reading the small descriptions and learning about well the UNIVERSE. Great purchase, a motivational tool for youngsters that might become astronauts after reading this book. Its very complete and really informative. A must have for astronomers and star aficionados. Its one of the coolest books ever."
5,Cosmology with Pictures!,"This is a superb book. Yes of course the written content is very interesting but I must admit that it is really nice to see all those pictures of ""topics"" we usually simply refer as equations, physics etc... For less than $20 (incredible price for the content / editing) everyone should have this book in his bookcase."
2,Poor Binding,The content is nice but the binding is pathetic. I've barely read this and the pages are ready to fall out.
4,UNIVERSE,"The binding is typical DK which is less substantial than other books in the price range, but the content is incredible. No need for any other book on the subject."
1,Not honestly represented,"My understanding of the word tapestry is a woven cloth. Or at least some type of cloth. I thought, wow what a good deal for this product! However, when I received it, it is PLASTIC. No where in the product description does it even hint that the product is plastic. This is not a tapestry wall hanging. It's just a sheet of plastic with butterfulies stamped onto it!"
2,Sparco 80057 Numbering Machine,"I read the other reviews and purchased this numbering machine based on those reviews, which except for 1, were very positive. NO ONE, HOWEVER, MENTIONED THE INSTRUCTIONS that came with the machine. They are not specific enough. I searched the web for better instructions, but only found the same sheet that comes with the product. The line drawings of the machine are not detailed enough for me, and it took me a long time to figure out how to work the machine. Granted, I had never used a numbering machine before, but I am a reasonably intelligent person who would not have experienced such difficulty if better instructions had been included. The machine does work well once you figure it out!!"
5,"Donald Liebenson (Amazon reviewer), what the hey!?! Thanks *not* for the spoilers in your 'review'.","Please don't detail specific plot points and events in reviews.If you have no opinion of the show and are restricted to providing a literal description of it, why not provide some detail of the what the DVD product contains. You know, special features and stuff.What is wrong with these people?Oh yeah, it's a great show. Watch this before any of that other ish you may be considering to watch first."
3,"Great show, DVD's might as well be on Hulu","On the other hand, I've watched Lord of the Rings extended edition 10 times and haven't watched the extras. Maybe they'll release an extended edition of their own.."
5,Amazing,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, FOTC!! Flipping amazing! So much cheaper sold at amazon than at anywhere else. Even cheaper than Target! Best Comedy series ever!"
4,Just as shown,"The product came just as described and on time. The only thing that kept it from 4 stars what that one of the DVDs were lose and it was scratched, but just a little."
5,Offbeat comedy,"Two New Zealanders move to New York to make it big in the music industry. Hilarity ensues. If you're a fan of the stand up/live performances of FOTC, you'll love the show as well."
1,I'M SOOOOOOOOOOOOO SICK OF THESE GUYS!,"I hate every song on this album because I hear it everywhere I go. I wish that Pearl Jam knockoff of a singer would just shut up for a minute. I know he has his ""Arms Wide Open"" and he wants to take me ""Higher,"" so enough already!"
2,"Listenable, But Boring","The songs dont have any catch to them. They just sound like a bunch of noise - and they all sound almost the same. Yes, Higher has catch to it. But their next single ""What If"" is just a flat song. It sounds more like glorified noise then music. Truly a huge disapointment after My Own Prison. Sounds like Creed has run out of songs."
3,"Harder than my Megadeth -- Risk?? If so, that's so sad.","Great follow up album, darker, possibily a tad heavier, and surely less mainstream than ""My Own Prison"". They may somewhat sound like Vedder, but I don't give a [care]. Pearl Jam has [stunk] ever since ""Ten"". Only The only really 'commerical' song is ""Higher,"" which they play 24/7."
2,A pretty good effort for a mediocre band,"Creed's certainly not a terrible band, and this cd is quite a good display of their limited skills. While some of the songs are actually listenable, others aren't so great, but on the whole this cd is worth any fan's money, if you happen to tolerate Scott Stapp's nasal vocals and the grungy, derivative sound. So if you're a creed fan, you definitely should get this. Other people might want to stay far, far away."
3,Oh no!,"Well, at first I thought I had found a great winner.......but after listening to the CD the first time I was disppointed.....then I TRIED to listen to it a few more times, this is a VERY weak CD....... Sorry people there older CD's are better!"
3,"A pretty good album, but not original enough","I like Creed. They're not my favorite band, but a lot of their music is still pretty enjoyable to listen to. My main complaint is that they imitate earlier '90s alternative bands too much. When listening to them, I often confuse Scott Stapp's exaggerated deep vocals for Eddie Vedder's of Pearl Jam. On this album, elements of early grunge bands are apparent, especially on ""What If?"", which sounds distinctly like something from the Stone Temple Pilots. Creed's hard rock is pretty strong, but seems to fall just short of great. But Creed is still a relatively young band, and they will probably grow and become more distinctive as they mature."
3,Not their best work,"Too soon after the release of the excellent ""My Own Prison"", the lyrics are often soppy and cliche ridden. (eg. 'with arms wide open'). The sound hasn't changed but the message has become blurred in an attempt to please the mass market. The religious overtones are far more pronounced. Its still a worth while listen but an album with a interest lifespan of a couple of months"
2,DISSAPOINTED,"I loved their first cd, but this one has only one good song""higher"", the rest are much too heavy metal for me. So if your buying this cd because of their first one you might be dissapointed."
4,Withstood the test of time for me,"This album is worth a listen. I don't like this band as much as Pearl Jam, Sound Garden, Bush or several others, but I am glad that these songs are on rotation in my music collection. The music is overall good and the lyrics actually have meaning."
5,Pearl Jam is Weak,"Creed is a Pearl Jam wannabe???? Are you kidding me. I've listened to PJ and think that Vedder's stuff is nonsensical. At least Stapp writes and sings from his heart and I can understand him when he sings (Eddie, get the cotton out of your mouth when you sing, it may come through better). The music may be in the same category but I believe it is a joke to list Creed as a wannabe PJ. Give Creed some respect. They are one of the best feel good stories in rock. Call them wannabe's. Call them a Christian Rock Group. Call them what you want as long as you listen to their music at least once. I wonder if most of the naysayers are anti Creed because of the band's strict feelings about no drugs or alcohol on the road and commitment to the better half?? If you haven't listened to Creed, pick up Human Clay and give it a shot. Or better et, get My Own Prison and prepare to be rocked by one of the best bands in the last three years."
4,Another one of my fave rock CDs,"I know it isn't as good as the debut release from Creed, but I love it a lot. My sister says ""Scott Stapp is sexy, and the band does pretty good too.""Well, I love the songs like ""Are You Ready"" and ""What If?"", and ""Say I."" It is sorta christian, but not completely though. One good thing is, it doesn't have all this cussing in it, and you need to get to that in some bands you listen to. It might not seem original to some of you, but trust me, compared to the average LB losers, this is good, though not a favorite.All I have to say...."
4,VERY PLEASANT SURPRISE,"I joined a band recently and I was asked to learn a lot of the new rock that is out... things like Godsmack, Fuel and the like. The music is ok, but really didn't do anything for me. I had to learn 3 Creed songs, so I picked up the CD expecting more of the same. I can't express how happy I am with this cd. Edgy but smart with an almost uplifting theme to it. It is like Alice in Chains but it doesn't put you in an angry mood when you're done listening to it. Bands like Creed give me faith that rock is not dead. Pick up this CD if you already haven't, I think you will be happy."
2,A Non-Decent follow-up to an amazing album,"Creed's first album, my own prison, was great. It was an amazing CD, and gets a 4 on my list. But...Human Clay just didn't offer me much. Sure, 'Higher' was great when it first came out, but now it's so annoying I want to break the record in half. Most songs are dull, and the same, and didn't catch my interest. Thankfully, Creed's new Weathered Album is great."
4,Pearl Jam Clone! I Don't think so!,"This album should be a clear indication that this is not a grunge album. It has inspiring lyrics music that motivates you all in positive ways, as far being depressing and pschologically damaging I'll leave that to the grunge era in general. I won't pin point but didn't Creed come out of the warm south and 90% of grunge or crap comeout of the dreary pacific northwest. To say positive and inspiring music is less credible than depressing serious music I think is a crock. Personally the glam metal scene of the eighties was more real than the flanel wearing depression of the pacific northwest. CREED WILL LAST LONGER BECAUSE THEY HAVE A POSITIVE MESSAGE."
4,Creed Plays it safe. Both Good and Bad.,"I think its a great album, great songs. Inspiring Lyrics. Scott has a powerful voice, and the band knows how to please its fans. Human Clay, probably did so well because Creed, instead of going into new ground, played it safe and gave the fans more of what they love. NOW, I don't mind that. But PLEASE!!! For the third album CHANGE CHANGE CHANGE! If these guys wanna last, they need to experiment and find there own sound. Like Stone Temple Pilots did with ""songs of the vatican"" which erased them of there ""They sound like Pearl Jam"" reputation. Scott also needs to experiment with his voice, try different tons and moods. Whisper, scream, but don't stay so monotone throughout the album. Almost every song on Human Clay can be compared to a My own Prison song. (Whats this life for=With arms wide open) Keep up the good songs Creed! Just grow and don't be afraid to try something new! Rock On!"
2,Question...,"Remember about 3 years ago, when both Creed & Days of the New fell under the category of ""Neo-Grunge""? Days took the more brooding S'Garden /AIC approach, while Creed took the PJ by-means-of Metallica way. But that was then & this is now.While DOTN (or Traivs Meeks) has decided to take their (his) music to new levels of grace & power, Creed have decided to play it safe & recycle ""My Own Prison""'s formula... with mixed results. Where ""MOP"" had moments of true power & beauty, ""Human Clay"" is just a boring rock album. However, I won't knock the entire album. ""Beautiful"" is just that & ""Never Die"" has alot of merit. And let's face it, who hasn't gotten ""Higher"" stuck in their head at least once? But other than that, there isn't much here.If you want impressive musicianship, get ""DOTN II"". If you want a good Creed album, ""My Own Prison"" works just fine."
1,Whatever!,"... this [is] deep religious rooted rock... I personallydisliked this album and dislike a great deal of this music. I suggestthat people check out Jackyl's Greatest Hits, Poison's Power tot hePeople, New Tattoo by Motley Crue, and even certain tracks off Crushby Bon Jovi. But, this stuff is just entirely too good boy for me."
3,Comme ce comme ca ( so so),"this is so unorginal it is insane and it seems like they are just trying to sound like what everybody wants them too instead of making music that is orginal that does not care what the heck everyone else thinks. I think Kurt was talking about their type of people in the song ""in bloom."" What the heck are they claiming to be anyways? are they christian or not? What kind of artist won't be clear in what they believe! that is what music is about. Yo Creed get some balls."
5,THE GOODS ARE HERE!,"Basicly this is a sweet cd. Buy it, you'll like it if you have got taste in music."
5,One of the best albums in history,"This album is a masterpiece. There is no other way to put it. There is not one song on this whole entire album that is weak in any way. The lyrics are full of symbolism and emotion. The most symbolic and religious song on the album is ""Faceless Man"", but so are ""Wrong Way"", ""Say I"", and ""Never Die"". And ""Beautiful"" talks about women who are beautiful on the outside but ugly on the inside. What an awesome cd!"
1,HORRIBLE,"This cd was AWFUL. i was going to buy it but i listened to my brother's copy and now i m glad i didn't. All of the songs except for ""Higher"" and ""arms Wide open"" were just this guy screaming something over and over. (if you've listened to ""What If"" you have to admit it sounds like he's screaming WERD ERF! WERD ERF! over and over.) And all the songs sounded like that! Unless you like that kind of thing over actual music, you should NOT but this cd. if you like ""Higher"" and ""Arms Wide Open,"" get the singles."
4,Awesome,This is my first CD by this group but they have captured my heart. Their lyrics are as thought they are looking into my soul to see what I'm feeling and telling a story about it. Higher and With Arms Wide Open take the cake as they show how even the blind can connect with heaven through their dreams.Go pick this up it will be worth you money.
3,"sorry, didn't like it","everyone seems to be gushing about how great this cd is, but let me offer an alternate perspective. i heard ""higher"" on the radio and bought the cd thinking that the rest of the it would be similar. the second half is good, the music resembling the style of the song i bought the cd for. the first half, however is more hard rock than i could stand. it's a personal preference i know, but if you buy this cd thinking that it's all going to be like ""higher"" or ""arms wide open"", you might be disappointed as i was. it's not an awful cd, just a waste of my money."
5,Truly an Awesome CD,The day I bought this CD I couldn't stop listening to it. I truly miss good rock bands. I am excited about Creed and can't wait to hear My Own Prison. I just hope that they will come to Austin sometime soon.
3,has lost a little since 2000,"For the most part I still prefer ""Weathered"" over this album.This one was known for the singles 'Higher' and 'Arms Wide Open' that made the band hugely popular. A few songs just don't have 'it'."
2,Creed is one of the better artists in popular music.,"For a while Creed fell out of popularity, but I don't care about things like that. These songs are good for people that are just getting into music, like teenagers. Like so many other bands in popular music, I think to myself; Where is justice? These bands are not much better than average and they are raking in millions, while many virtuosos can barely afford their clothes. Frankly, these songs are just too simple for me to get much enjoyment out of them. I listen to these songs maybe 3 times and am sick of them until a few years later. Then, I get bored and put it back in the player and reminisce. When I think of Creed, I think of the power of corporate America to make something only slightly above mediocre quality popular, especially because it conforms to a genre that is modern and popular."
1,HAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!,yeah this is great lololololololol the singer sounds like he's clearing his throat the whole time lolololol!!!!!
4,Needs to be Bought,This CD has a little bit of everything. Some hard rock and some soft rock. It depends what kind of mood you're in to listen to the different songs.So I say 4 stars! And two thumbs up from me! Buy this CD; you won't regret it!
2,Overpraised? Times Ten!,"I am a big fan of My Own Prison, which I thought was one of the better CD's to hit the mainstream in quite some time when it burst out. Human Clay, however, just seems like a conscious attempt to turn the attention they earned into a cash machine. It obviously worked, as Human Clay has sold over 10 million copies. I think there are decent tracks here, but I honestly can't find anything that holds up to my favorite tracks from My Own Prison (the album ending pair, ""What's This Life For?"" and ""One""). I don't understand how a song like ""With Arms Wide Open"" can get so much praise. It's a decent track, but trying to believe that it's better than, say, ""jimmy"" by Tool just leaves me confused with the state of music. It may not be in a state of complete dysfunction, but it seems somehow hijacked. Which, appropriately, is basically how I feel about Creed."
1,Faceless man? More like faceless band,"After listening to their generic debut, I somehow hoped this album will mark an improvement over My Own Prison, and forge their own unique sound. Well, no such luck. The songs in this album are pretty much the same to their first one. I'm sure the grunge-loving kids will lap this album up, even if this sound has been done a heck of a lot better by those early Seattle bands."
1,"Creed = 90s grunge ripoff, nothing original here","With Human Clay, as well as in my own prison, Creed seems content with sounding exactly the same as pearl jam, alice in chains, soundgarden etc. Creed is living in the past and even if it had been released say in 1994, you would still find nothing original in this band. If you like Creed's songs, why settle for a mediocre generic substitute when you can have the real thing. Go out and buy Pearl Jam's TEN, Alice in Chain's DIRT, Soundgarden's SUPERUNKNOWN, or even Stone Temple Pilot's CORE and you'll find that Creed seems to borrow everything and improve on nothing. Eddie Vedder et al have moved on passed grunge, even if it is not making them any money because grunge is dead, now Creed, please die too"
5,"let them be, and let the music rock!!!!!","Let's face th facts Creeds first album was outstanding, and the second album follows right behind. Who cares if their chrisitan band, or not a christian band,let them rock, and take it how you want. If you don't have this album get it. Their no pearl jam because their the best, but they are the future..."
5,Creed is good...TOGETHER!!!!,"Ever since Creed broke up I have been saying to myself...what the hell??? Alter Bridge and a solo Scott Stapp...THEY BOTH SOUND LIKE CREED!!! I loved Human Clay, ALL the albums... but it makes you think that while they where good when they where a THEY if you add up Scott Stapp's album to Alter Bridge's album you get the amount of sales of a Creed album....this is what confuses me as to why they broke up in the first place. Human Clay was a great album, only reason it's great is because they where together!!! Makes you miss 1999!!!!"
4,Human Clay is Grunge Revival,"A lot of people have talked about how Creed virtually copies early '90s grunge bands; after buying the CD, I have to admit that this is true. But that's not really a bad thing, considering how bands like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden are no longer in the limelight. With elements obviously borrowed from Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots, Human Clay is ""grunge revival""; though it may not be the most original rock album ever made, it does a good job at carrying on the grunge tradition."
4,"Aint No ""my own prison"" but its still a winner!","this is a great fallback from My Own Prison by Creed, though ""Higher"" is getting a little annoying on the local radio stations it still a great song, along with ""With Arms Wide Open"", ""Wrong Way"", ""What If"", ""Beautiful"", ""Say I"", and ""Inside Us All"" also on this album.... Mark Tremonti is one of if not the best Guitarist in rock today, so that is one of the reasons i like this album so much.... i cant wait for their forthcoming album that has previously recorded unreleased tracks aboard...."
1,There's nothing worse,"This is, by far, the worst band I have ever heard. Creed is bad enough when you listen without making references, but when you consider that everything they record is a ripoff of one thing or another the whole experience becomes doubly horrible (if this is at all possible). I can't believe that anyone actually listens to this nauseating crap. Creed is comparable in musical value to fingernails on a chalkboard (no offense meant toward the chalkboard). Whoever signed these morons to a label should be institutionalized. If there is an ounce of mercy in the world, Creed will mysteriously disappear from the face of the earth, never to record another note."
3,no My Own Prison,"this album was a pretty big dissapointment. first time through i thought it was every bit as good as my own prison. after listening to it a couple more songs i got p#ssed at their shallow lyrics. whatever happeded to beautiful poetic lyrics in songs like pitty for a dime. you wont find songs like that here. scott basically screams the title of the song for four minutes. comeon guys! that is not cool. the guitar distortion gets super old. its the same for the whole 50 minutes. how boring! there's different types in case you didnt know. the whole disk-at-once also bothers me cause there's stupid noises in the background that lead to every song. i give human clay two stars with one courtesy star. please creed, try harder next time.."
3,With ears closed tightly,"Let me start of by saying I did by this album, and enjoyed for about a week hoping it would grow on me. Well it didn't. Reason being that every song is in dropped D (drop the low E of a guitar a full step to D), and sounds exactly the same. Another thing that bugs me is how Scott Stapp sounds just like: Eddie Veddar (yes he does and you know it), Lane Staley, Scott Weiland, Travis Meeks, Hugo (whatever his name is from Tantric). Why does every rock singer want to sound like the rest? puzzles me. Anyway, this cd is full of ""epic"" ""heart felt"" compositions that border on near comedic porpotions."
2,Creed at its Worst,"I disliked this album almost instantly.There are a few strong points. ""Beautiful"" and ""Say I"" pack a back-to-back punch early in the CD, and ""Faceless Man,"" although long, adds something as well. The rest of the album is overly cliched (if you can't see this in ""Higher,"" then don't bother reading my review). ""Higher"" I consider the worst song on the CD; its nothing but pure unadulterated cheese. ""With Arms Wide Open"" isn't great either, but at least its about his kid, so he gets a little pass - but there's much better out there. ""What If"" also fails to deliver any impact, and the rest of the album is no better.Creed is a hit-or-miss band. They've released some great songs and some real bad ones. And most of those bad ones show up on ""Human Clay."""
5,the best album ever!!!,"I think Creed's album(Human Clay) is very very good!!!These are my track ratings:Are You Ready 8.5/10What if 10/10Beutiful 9.5/10Say I 10/10Wrong Way 9.5/10Faceless Man 9/10Never Die 9.5/10With Arms Wide Open 9.5/10Higher 10/10Wash Away Those Years 9.5/10Inside Us All 9/10Creed mixes metal,rock,and light rock.I really like this cd, and I suggest you buy it."
1,Creed is the most overrated band in history,Creed is the most bland and mundane band I have ever heard. I'm not going to waste anymore time on this review.
5,Higher & Higher,"This second effort by Creed certainly took me higher. And not just because they are a Florida band. Hey, I do not care if it IS about Heaven or Christianity. If the music moves me, if the rhythms make me close my eyes, if the gritty vocals wrap me in a thrust deep within my soul, I will enjoy & recommend it.Sexy & soulful...""Human Clay""....hear it & be molded into Creed's dreamery.if you find my comments interesting, please click the ""yes""--thanks--CDS"
1,heard this before somwhere!!,i liked them better when they were called PEARL JAM!!!!!!!!! GET YOUR OWN SOUND BOYS! 10 YEARS TOO LATE!
4,"Good, solid rock performance",I was not familiar with the band before giving this a listen and I like what I heard. Willlook to add more Creed to library.
4,"Best Colossus since the ""X-Men""","Wow. This is a musical experience. It's jazz + hip-hop at its finest. It's engaging, and lyrically sharp. It's definitely worth a buy, and the included remix CD is worth listening to as well.Enjoy!"
2,Boring,The slow movements are too slow and the faster ones do not sparkle. This recording only deserves its place as background music in elevators...I recommend the recording of some of these pieces with the Scottish Chamber Orchetra - they rock !
2,Disappointing,I wound up returning this book as it proved to disappoint me similar to the other reviews. Their were very few prices and there are much better books available.
3,Good entertaining book series.,"I always enjoy a Jake Lassiter book, however, the quality of the Kindle book needs a quality review before releasing for sale of product. Specifically, there were several spots in the book that needed separation for clarity which made the physical reading disjointed. A page break could solve this issue."
4,Jake Lassiter,"Flesh & Bones is the first Paul Levine novel I have read, It is the 7th in the Jake Lassiter series. I really enjoyed this mystery novel, and don't feel it was necessary to read previous books in the series.Jack Lassiter, a football player turned Lawyer, is a character you care about. I enjoyed the inner workings of Lassiter's mind as he struggles to defend his client who was seen shooting her father.Levine kept the interest with humor, plot twists and details of court room strategy,water rights and research into 'recovered memories'I received a complimentary copy of Flesh & Bones in exchange for a review."
2,It's alright..,This was one of the lower priced items for the Rose Petal Cottage. It's durable enough and fits well in the Cottage. My little girl is 5 and it fits her perfect.
1,cute but poorly made,"While the chair looked very cute and seemed to be something that a toddler would like to sit in, it was not. The chair is flimsy. My two year old kept falling out of it. Very unstable chair. The seller sent it in record time. I was very pleased with them. Through no fault of theirs, the chair just did not work out for us."
1,Chair is horrible and no where in the description does it say inflatable!!!,I got this chair for my little granddaughter. I was so disappointed to see it come in a flat box because I didnt know it was inflatable. Once we got it inflated she tried it and it scared her half to death. She rolls to one side or the other and she cant sit back in it. It is by far the worst Kids item that I have ever purchased. I wouldnt recommend it for any child of any age. Even my 6 pound yorkie doesnt fit in it comfortably.
5,Worth Ur Buckz!,"This story is beautiful and passionate. the heir 2 the throne of argone falls in love with a woman raised 2 b a nun. her twin sister is evil n tries 2 marry him. she is devastated, but will not give in 2 her twin's treachery...2gether the two will form a love so strong, that nothing can destry it..Madeleine Baker at her best..."
1,"Great Concert, but...","I'd rate the concert portrayed here as very good for it's day. I don't know of other legitimate video releases that cover this period; therefore it does have worth to longtime Kinks fans. I do enjoy the show, weird camera angles and all. The original recording was probably very good; I'd love to see a better copy of it.Now, on to THIS DVD. It is terribly out of sync, which is a HUGE distraction.This can't be sanctioned by the band. There is no mention of any of their usual record or video labels. There are ZERO liner notes or credits. I suppose it's in public domain by now.SO... since the Kinks likely get nothing from us purchasing this poorly reproduced video, I'd suggest you save your money and download the thing from youtube in identical quality. If this were only avilable here, I'd be forced to give it a higher rating, but as I said; get it elswhere...And if you run into Ray Davis, ask him to put out some quality material from this era. I'd buy it... wouldn't you?"
4,Very Good Read,"This book was quite informative. Some thing I already knew, and alot I did'nt know. Good read. And good reference book."
1,"Boo, links in table of contents don't work in iPad",Awesome. Started at the table of contents and wanted to jump to the section on clicker training. But the links don't work and there are no page numbers so I have to flip page by page through half the book. Totally unacceptable.
5,awesome!,these guys rock! they take ska to the limits with this cd. i hope they keep up the good work!
2,Bad choice,"Cant believe this was a Linklater film. Boring, tacky writing, cloying performances all around. Zac Efron is terrible, and unbelievable."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"A thoroughly enjoyable film with more depth than is immediately apparent. Zac Efron continues to make smart choices in breaking away from the ""Disney Channel curse"" - he keeps stretching but not so far and so fast as to alienate his fans. Christian McKay is uncanny as Welles (I happened to have seenThe Third Manabout a week before ""Me and Orson Wells"" so the young Welles was fresh in my mind)."
5,THIS IS THE BEST BAND,"Whoever said Hold on was a bad song, yal wrong, that song touched me indeed. This album is very very very good. I think the people who give it 1 stars are crazy! This is a good album!!!"
5,Good Charlotte CD rocks,"This CD rocks. they have been in the game for a long time, but know they got there big break. The are finally on top. I think they deserve all the fame they get.The cd has all hot tracks go. Every 1 should go out in buy it. U [stink] IF U DON'T!!!!!!!"
4,GC Rox My Sox!,"I loved this CD. I think that it was just as good, if not better than their last album! I adore GC anyways, but the songs are just.. wow. You can tell that they have DEFENITLY grown up since their last album, and I just love it!"
1,worst band ever,"i agree with samantha from florida. you are supposed to like music for the music. except this music (is bad)! i couldn't care if these guys were so underground that they dug a hole in the earth and played there. i'd laugh at these guys anyway. first of all none of the music is creative or fun. its just poppy garbage forced upon by a bunch of idiot record executives. the lyrics are just the most immature and terrible thing ever. and i can't describe it anymore. its just horrible. if you are thinking about buying this cd,smack yourself,hard. if you already own it, return it and tell the clerk that you wanted music not (junk)."
2,Old Like.,"I started off liking the band from the song, ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" I thought it was a catchy, yet true song, but now I despise the song. ""The Anthem"" got ever as annoying followed by all the other songs on the play list. I find this band is attracted by young preteens and young teenagers. I've heard a lot of negative responses to this band. The only song I've really liked is ""Emotionless"""
2,Hmmmmmmmm,Im not sayin Good Charlotte is bad...theres just something about them that is just...hmmmmmm.....Their just................i dunno....hmmmmmmmmm.......well..if u want punk pop then get sum 41 or bowling for soup or at least simple plan! these guys are just..........i dunnno
5,BEST CD!,"i love this cd. i got it right after i listened to it from my friend. i went and bought it and fell in love with every song! my favorite is the bloody valentine...if u do decide to get the cd, listen to all of them cuz they are all so good! its really my favorite cd of all times. so go get it!"
3,Disappointed,"Okay...Good Charlotte's first cd was awesome. I was a fan automatically. I could've easily predicted this new cd to be plastered all over MTV and other happy-go-lucky music television channels. Granted I will give Benji, Joel, Billy, and Paul (yes there are 2 other members! *gasp* You'd never guess if the only exposure you have of them is from MTV) some credit. This new cd was alright. It's hard to top a debut album, and the cd Good Charlotte (self-titled) was great. I listen to THAT cd everyday.If you're into MTV, you might wanna pick this cd up. It surprised me with a few good songs, but I'd download this one. Spend your money on their first cd."
2,hey,"Alright, so you're considering buying a Good Charlotte album, are you? That is completely you're business and if you want to buy it go ahead. I'm not going to go on and on about how they are not really ""punk"" beacuase that's pretty damn pretentious. However I am going to offer you some alternatives to it, that it my opinion, are much, much better. You should consider getting an album (or two) by: Circle Jerks, Black Flag, The Clash, Operation Ivy, Anti-Flag, The Ramones, The Damned, Dead Kennedys, Crass, Stiff Little Fingers, Rancid, Tiger Army, AFI, Misfits, Nekromantix...and much, much more. So anyway I hope that if you haven't heard of these bands (obviously you've heard of The Clash and The Ramones)you check them out and enjoy them."
5,The Young and Hopeless-Good Charlotte,"Good Charlotte has certainly shown again just exactly how talented they are. They have come a long way since their first cd. What was once and underground emo band, ( which few people knew who they were ) has now grown into a huge sucess with just about everyone. I love their cd because each song has awesome lyrics. It is so easy to relate to their songs because many teens today go through the same things that they went through. An example of this would be track 8. That song is so easy to relate to, especially for teens. I highly recommend this cd. It is honestly one of my favorite cds."
2,A CD to burn not buy,"Sadly disappointing. After friends had gone on about this CD for a while I saw it in MVC and bought it on impulse. Unfortunately, although I do like ""anthem"" and ""wondering"" quite a lot, after hearing the many similiar songs a few times and still not 'getting into' the CD, I decided that perhaps my hard-earned cash shouldn't have been parted with.The vocals aren't brilliant, there's nothing really original about the lyrics or music. A mediocre CD. As an introduction to punk (like the CDs people seem to have bought with this, Sum 41, New Found Glory, Avril) it is a good choice, or for parties perhaps, but for those more experienced listeners, this is really a CD to burn not buy."
1,Fall out boy lover WHY?,I just have to rag on fall out boy lover for saying that if you want to listen to heavy music listen to good charlotte is she on dope or something i mean come on. Now to this album in a short review i will just say that it sux and no more or i might go insane because i hate this band and just about all other emo with a passion. listen to led zeplin or alice in chains if you want good music and if you do compare that to this and see if you still like these posers that have no clue how to do anything obviosly. listen to the guitar. jerry cantrell(alice in chains) would make this look like stuff that a five year old kid who doesnt even know what a guitar is could play.
5,Outstanding,"I picked up The Young and the Hopeless after having enjoyed Good Charlotte live in my city. Not only is this album as enjoyable as GC's live performance, its even better! The audio is great and the effects are awesome! I'd recommend this CD to anyone no matter what genre of rock music you listen to"
2,Catchy but [weak] after a while.,"I own this CD and I liked it at first. It had some pretty good songs. But then again they were sort of not exactly interesting. I liked the CD for about a week and then it got really [weak]. I don't like this album. ""Lifestyles of The Rich and Famous"" isn't as good as many people think it is. And whats with them dressing up as like hardcore punk rockers when their songs are just shallow. ""The Anthem"" didn't move me at all. It wasn't as good as other albums I could think of at this very moment. It's just not good. It's a waste of money trust me on this. Good Charlotte is sold out. It always has been. It's a [weak] excuse for sold out pop punk. ..."
1,God dude what a pointless mainstream punk act,"In listening to this Good Charlotte album, another reviewer's remark really rang clear for me, especially after seeing the Good Charlotte heartfelt video on MTV. Like an immense pile of other acts out there, these idiots have convinced themselves, we've come up with something clever! We are so good, look at all the passion and power in our music! It is such a discusting fallacy. Good Charlotte is a watered down punk version of an already watered down Blink 182. I assure you of one thing kids, and you marketing guy responsible for this giant heap of crappy music, the time is coming when people will take a stand against horrible mainstream acts like Good Charlotte."
2,"DEFINATELY not punk, mediocre whining at best","I don't understand how anyone can call this band punk. Even if you like the band, I don't know how you can call it punk. This is whiny soft alternative at best. This is definately the most over-rated band of the year. Think about bands like Black Flag and The Misfits and then think about this band and other bands of this type. It is pop with electric guitar is all it is. The singer whines out of his nose throughout the album as most pop artists do. There were only two songs on this that I could tolerate and that was ""Lifestyles..."" and ""Girls and Boys"". If you want modern day REAL punk, go look for a Thrice or an AFI album and let all the TRL posers grab this one. And for the record, their first release is even worse."
2,What is up!,"yeah so I listened to everyone of these songs. I don't really like any of them. I got their first cd 1,000,000 years ago and I loved it. I know every word from every song... that's how mayn times I've listened to it. I'm not one of those weird kids that reads the lyrics in that litte booklet thing. Anyways, Good Charlotte changed their style so the mtv crowd would listen to their music. I was disappointed. There's about one song that's like their old ones and that's great but the stupid songs like Boys and Girls and Riot Girl are just pathetic. I wouldn't recommend this cd to anyone unless you're one of those kids that buys a cd cuz the guys on it are 'oh so hot'. Yeah that's about all I have to say.."
5,GOOD Charlotte,"This CD is the best punk CD you'll hear in a while. It has pretty powerful lyrics, written by twins, Benji and Joel. While the flavor of the music is punk, songs such as ""Bloody Valentine"" prove they're not little boys anymore. Buy this CD. You'll NEVER regret it."
1,thank u 'Kelly M Moning',"i was sick and tired of seeing people giving this good charlotte stuff 4 or 5 stars. ( even 2 or 3 stars!) i am a total fan of punk music ( bad religion) iand when i heard 30 seconds of this crap i instantly thought wat a disgrace to punk music. these guys arent punk they're stupid pop dudes and posers. i also like Blink 182 and knowing theyer song 'Anthem' when i saw good ckharlotte's song 'the anthem' i couldnt help but yell ""POSERS""i read kelly M Moning's review and thought thank you god for someone else besides me who hates good charlotte. finnaly someone who can say the words ""Good Charlotte sux"" once again thank you Kelly Moning! hopefully GC will die soon. if i offended any GC fans, well then GOOD!"
3,A Sturdy Entry,"Clearly not thier best offering, The Young and the Hopeless is easy to engage. There's humor (Day That I Die), and truly felt sorrow (Emotionless). If yelling and screaming punk anarchists is your thing, there's plently of that too. Perhaps this recording suits better the dynamic of us, rather than the stagnant. Another thing Mister and Misses critique; if this recording is so damn bad, than why are there 2000 reviews? You're the same people, so to speak, that wanted Teen Spirit recorded over and over and over again. Crawl out of your self-imposed pigeon hole and GIVE CHANGE A CHANCE. Don't listen to them! This offering is well worth checking. That guy across the street, with his brain glued shut, DON'T BELIEVE HIM! Just get it!"
3,Come On,"Hey Grim Reaper, why the hell are you wasting you're time writing a review of this album. You heard it once and felt so compelled to go on amazon and write a review of how bad you thought it was. You're not gonna convince anyone who took their time to go to this site and look up this album to not listen to GC. By the way the album's pretty good and I give it 3 1/2 stars. Not as good as their first but still a great LP for any Modern Rock fan."
1,Caca caca caca!!!,"Put it this way, Id rather tape record the sounds of me taking a caca, then burn it to a cd, and play it over and over. And I'll get the same thrill. The lyrics are so plain and stupid, that a child's nursery rhymes are more deep and actually worth listening to."
1,This is NOT punk!,"(...)These are posers who dress like a hardcore punk band, and sound gay! For good and REAL punk, listen to Bad Religion, From Autumn To Ashes, Between The Buried And Me, Dead Kennedys, Minor Threat, and the starters of punk The Misfits!Peace out all!"
3,"Overall, a pretty good CD","This is probably the first CD I got that was anywhere near punk. I was so happy and I thought I was so punk, and it was my favorite CD. Looking at all my CD's now (with bands like Blink 182, Taking Back Sunday and Linkin Park), I laugh at myself, but that's not because I think G.C. sucks. Honestly, I think this is a pretty good CD. With lyrics like ""Hold On"", ""Emotionless"", ""Say Anything"" and ""Wondering"", it's still a good CD but I have other things in my CD player now. I think their new album has a lot more depth, but this is still worth an occasional listening. I think it's worth borrowing or burning, but not buying."
1,Listen to the music GC listens to...,"I used to listen to mainstream music such as the first Good Charlotte CD, Blink 182, and Offspring because that was the only punk music I knew of. Then my friends introduced me to other bands that I had never heard of that I liked much much more than anything I had previously listened to. It was then that I learned that the best music you will not hear on the radio or on MTV, but is something that you have to search for.Good Charlotte is absolutley talentless and you will get sick of this CD within days because every song sounds the same. The guitar chords are repetative, and the music emotionless with lyrics my sister could write. I will have to admit, if you watch their music videos, they all wear T-shirts of very good bands such as Catch-22 and the Used.Do yourself a favor and check out these bands: Thursday, A Static Lullaby, Alkaline Trio, Sublime, Taking Back Sunday, My Chemical Romance and the Get Up Kids."
1,keep fininding more reasons to hate them,"which is why this is probably my fifth review of good charlotte. I keep on fininding bands that are so great when compared to good charlotte-and really who names a band good charlotte anyway-and plus anything sounds good compared to these guys. they've sold out from the beginning. i just recently got a white stripes cd...now thats good music. meanwhile the good charlotte cd that i want my well earned money back from is sitting on my friends shelf or maybe in her cd player. im not sure. go listen to white stripes, nirvana,dead kennedys,sex pistols, or the clash.actually, on the other hand, dont. you think that this is punk.in my opinion (though very few of you people care bout it) the only good pop is japanese pop and jazz...and i'm only talking about the theme songs to their animes."
2,[Not Good],"If you want to hear simple riffs and plenty of childish lyrics, then this CD is for you. I have to admit that I thought that their first CD was good and that the singles from this CD were very catchy, but this album as a whole is awful! I have listened to it two or three times now and I can already tell you that I will probably never put it in my CD player again. It's that bad! After listening to the lyrics on this album, it is no wonder that GC's core audience is 15 year old girls!! The lyrics cater to high school nonsense and have no business coming from dudes who are in their mid-twenties..."
4,YEAH!! I LIKE THOSE GUYS!!!,"I don't know.. maybe and I am a ""young and hopeless"" teenager so that is why i like this album!!very good songs-lovely melodies-and nice lyrics!The guitars sound hard+wild and harmony tunes that easily you can memorised them. so what else could have an album to be almost PERFECT?except the stupid intro. and the whole thing about joel's and benji father... (ok man your father left you? so... you are not the only one? and you know something i don't care about your family stories..!)the rest of the album is excellent!!"
1,Actually heard about 5 times,my coach in High School would play this crap when we were playing basketball. None of the Blackids and most of the white kids hated this stuff but he kept on playing the junk. It is about partying and other Bull $hit like that. There was only one good song on here and the lyrics were lame to. These guys make repetative music without no substance at all or no great instrumentalist. Even thought I am a strait guy girls that Joel Madden dude is not hot but instead he is a huge poser. I do like Blink 182 but most of this type of this music is junk. I remember when all the TRL girls were saying these guys were awesome in 2000. Am I missing something. There third CD is below average but is better then this album. By Rock music from Arcade Fire and Franz Ferdinand and stuff besides this stuff.
4,It's not about image,"Yes they are trendy, yes they do look harder than they sound but that's not what it's about. I think they look dark punk or gangster punk maybe a little goth but who cares? People go through hard times in their life and on this record they talk about murder, about benji and joel's father who abandoned them when young. They had a different style on thir last album image and sound. i think got darker just like a kid might decide to get darker. thier music tlaks about some hard issues and also some love songs. they are pop punk but let's not talk about what music's not about- image."
1,"this deserves negative 20,000,000,000,000,000,000.... stars","Wow, i hate posers was right... This is the worst punk band since, well ever. Here are the order of great punk bands1: Nirvana2: The Sex Pistols3: Ramones4: The Clash5: MXPX.....1,000,000,000: Good CharlotteWow, they got 1 billionth, they suck! I've never hated a band this much since Hanson came out. This isn't punk, it's crap. Lyrics are extremely weak with repetative guitar melodies, fast but terrible drumming and thin slow bass playing. Terrible, just buy Nirvana, The Sex Pistols and\or Blink 182 CD's.PS: Nirvana is only responsible for bringing punk into the mainstream, not creating it."
4,Great!!,"i've always been an fan of punk. Punk has varied so much through the years. Good Charlotte is a great band with great music and now has a great albam, this type of punk is more pop than the past punkers of the ages, similar music are simple plan, blink182, mest, greenday and so on. Yet the music is still good and i recomment it to any person who enjoy punk at all aspects"
1,These guys are some good lookin' retarded chimps,"Seriously....these guys sound like spoiled, whiney, retarded five year olds. It this what pubescent girls find attractive these days? I've only heard this crap in malls, Old Navy, and TV (which has gotta tell ya something right off)- and when I do it makes me cringe in the same way the thought of a Tabasco Sauce enema does.Want punk? - one word....G.G. AllenWant music? - Beethoven's late quartetsWant commoditized product to better investors' prospectus - Good Charlotte"
4,The Young and the Hopeless,"Good Charlotte's new album The Young and the Hopless is a great album deffinately worth buying. It has a punk feel and songs with deep lyrics. Each song has its own edge ranging from harder ones like My Bloody Valentine to songs like Hold On that are more inspirational. This really gives kids something to listen to when they're feeling bad. It helps to know that someone went through the same things that you're going through and can relate to your problems. Aside from this we can't forget all the talent Paul, Billy, Benji, and Joel have that they put into one of the best punk albums. Keep representing GC!"
5,They Have Done It Agian!,"If you like the first cd then u will love this cd all the songs on it are AWESOME! especialy "" The Young And The Hopeless"" and ""My Old Man"". GC is still the best punk rock group in the world. I advise you to buy it now! In the first week the cd has hit #7 on the charts so it has to be good."
1,re-re-retards!!!,"wow, great cd, the drums suck, the guitar sux, and the singer is such a fag. this cd should burn under the flame of my fart!! punk sucks a**. what a bunch of f*****g posers. kill all these retards!!! yippeeeeeee!!!! if ya wanna listen to some good music try listening to cradle of filth, or in flames, im me at mysticyautja if you wish"
2,the good old days,"Remember the good ol' days when you were the only kid on your block sportin' the GC goods? well, those days are as far gone as Aaron. But, thats ok, because their sophomore release showcases their pop-punk best! With The Young and the Hopeless, Good Charlotte not only proves that they are a mainstream commodity, but that the radio stations love em! so what if that almost completely contradicts everything they have stood for in the past? Just go out and buy their new cd and be happy that you can now ""fit in"" with the punk rock kiddies in your high school.suggested listening:A New Found Glory, Midtown, The Starting Line, or any other ""on-the-verge-of-being-on-heavy-rotation-on-mtv"" pop-punk band"
2,"Punk, no. Pop, yes","Ok, this is pop music. Not punk or rock or nothin. Just like Linkin Park, Simple Plan, All American Rejects, Avril Lavigne, ect.If you want to hear some real punk, get some Dead Kennedys, Circle Jerks, Damned or Black Flag; People that played back when punk was alive, because its dead now, thanks to people like Good Charlotte.If your a little 13 year old teenie bopper (I love that word) that shops at Hot Topic, this is a great cd for all you [morons].I gave this cd 2/5 stars because I'm sure their SONGWRITERS at least tried making this cd (which I now use as a coaster, good thing I didnt pay for it)."
5,The Young And Hopeless,"I Love Joel's Voice And All Their Songs. Iwish That Someday I Will Have The Oppurtunity Of Meeting Him. I Feel Like I Know Him Just By Listening to This album. You Feel His Pain By Listening To Songs Besides 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,and 14. he sings of his past and how his father drank and left him, his twin (Benji), his mother, and his sister. his other songs are about love or free fun. you should have all the family time that you can so get of your lazy computer ass and buy the album. Joel If You Ever See This Review Than Go To The Amazon Factory Place and Track Me Down Cuz I Really Wanna Meet You. By Listening To Your Songs I Feel Like I'm In Love With You. I Wanna See If You Are Who I Think You Are. Joel Madden, I Love You."
5,Good Charlotte CD,"Good Charlotte are one of the best bands out there!! One thing that really separates them is that they are real. They have gone through so much ..., and made it through, so they are singing about real situations, and real life experiences. I love how they have been through it all, and have still manage to not be bitter, but want to help other kids. There songs inspire, encourage and help kids who are going through hard times. And then there are other songs for people who just want to have fun and rock out! I love Good Charlotte and i hope they'll be around for a long time!"
3,Pretty Good,"Overall and by far, the best song on this cd is emotionless...I have listened to it like 10 times in a row and i just absolutely love it. THAT SONG gets 2 stars. Other favorites of mine are:Lifestyles of the rich and the famous (great beat man), The story of my old man, and all the others are just okay. I think you should listen to samples, and just download the songs you like.Bands i recommend:Yellowcard, Graham Colton Band (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, GREAT LIVE!!) Hoobastank, Sum 41, Three Doors Down, Third Eye Blind, Fallout Boy, Matchbox 20, Train, Foo Fighters, and SOME Simple Plan."
1,Lyrical Geniuses,"""And these girls like these boys like these boys like these girls. The girls with the bodies like boys with ferrari's""incredible"
5,AWSUM!,i recently listened to the Good Charlotte cd the young and the hopeless at my friends and immediatly went out and bought one the cd is awsum and i really like how they write from experiance and everything is so real!
1,Disgust,"This band is horrible, and from the review from Andrew, as you sai ""Were jealous because our bands didn't make the status Good Charlotte did"". That's very funny since, none of our ""So called"" bands have even tried to become mainstream as Good-Charlotte can get. The Clash, ever heard of them? Rancid? Misfits"" any of them ring a bell. No because, none of them had even tried to get into gc's status. And you know what's sad Most of the bands that don't try are more listened, then Good Charlotte will ever be."
5,young and hopeless,"This cd is very ""eclectic"" as benji would say. its much different than their first cd, although the first cd was awesome, this one rocks too. there's songs i can relate to such as ""hold on"" and ""the young and the hopeless"". this cd is very personal and i really like it. i've listened to it constantly since i got it(the very first day it came out) i hope this makes more people want to buy it because it takes a lot of talent to make an album like this and hopefully this cd will help some people, i know it's helped me."
1,Booooring,"This is a terrible CD...I never bought it, I just listened to my friend's copy...I was never into Good Charlotte because I had heard songs like 'The Anthem' and 'Girls and Boys' and hated them. 'The Anthem' bites Jay-Z so I could never forgive them for that one either. So they didn't bite him exactly, but listen to the chorus for 'The Anthem' and the one for 'H to the Izzo' and try and tell me they aren't similar.Other bad songs include 'My Bloody Valentine' and everything else on the album. Don't bother."
2,...,"Im not a fan or anything but you people who complain about Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous need to realize that song was written before they got rich and famous.Its not hypocritical.Plus its not about all rich and famous people,just the ones who have it all yet complain (which GC tends to do).That is all..."
1,As many reviwers have stated...,"This isn't punk! It's pop, clear and simple-- you're just following the trend if you think listening to Good Charlotte makes you punk. I laugh when I see kids turn all ""punk"" (spike arm bands and ripped pants don't make anyone punk) and only to find out their favourite band is GC.I really can't blame any of the kids for liking Good Charolette though, because the RIAA and greedy major record companies force these kids to listen to it, paying off radio stations to prevent indie music from getting on the airwaves. The funny thing is though, while RIAA reported a drop in sales over the last couple of years, indie labels reported a significant increase.Kids, there is so much great music lying outside of MTV and your local major radio station that it really isn't hard to find at all. Be truely different and listen to music that none of your friends do-- now that's being more punk than GC ever hope to be."
1,One of the worst bands in music today.,"After hearing two songs on this, I already felt like I was about to puke. This isn't punk rock; hell, this isn't even music. I'm in the age group of kids who usually like this stuff, and I say: why like it? It's about as punk as Eminem is country, the songs all sound the same and take no skills to play, and the people who play this ""music"" are a bunch of posers. This is just another no-talent pretty boy band that the mainstream spewed out and MTV made everyone think was great. Blink182, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, Simple Plan.. this is all sh*t music. If you want punk rock, listen to Green Day, Rancid, Anti-Flag, Dead Kennedies, NoFX, the Sex Pistols, the Ramones.. and f*ck this teeny-bopper crap."
5,Good Charlotte is the best band EVER no matter what u say!!!,"I know sometimes people write on these reviews because they want everybody to know that they hate Good Charlotte. People like that are so immature that it discusts me. My opinion on that is that when they call other people ""stupid"" for liking Good Charlotre they are just as ""stupid"" for dissing on them. For all you GC haters out there dissing on GC doesn't make you look cool. It makes you look dumb. Good Charlotte is one of the only truely sincere bands left. They actually mean what they have to say. Their music helps me to get though the day sometimes. This cd has some very emotional songs on it as well as some very happy and uplifting ones. Good Charlotte has the talent to address serious issues in the right manner as well as brighten someone's day. The vocals are wonderful and so are the guitars and drums. This band can do anything. I love 'em a ton."
2,errmm...,"At first I was kinda into Good Charlotte. But the more I listened to it and the more I heard other music, GC jsut failed to lvie up to standards. The lyrics seem uninspired and even hypocritical considering GC is &quot;rich and famous&quot; The music video for Hold On is alright and The Anthem is an alright song the first few times, but otherwise the cd is pretty disappointing.True= GC is not punkTrue= a**hole punks who hate GC before listening to them suckTrue= The members of the band are jerksTrue= Benji's tear tattoo uner his eye is fakeThey get 2 stars for the few moments when they actually are creative and for benji having an alright voice...they lost stars for anything else Is aid in this"
1,Sucky Poser Band,"Good Charlotte are one of the worst things that has happend to rock music ever. I will admit I used to like this crap (I was like 11 when it came out, I have an excuse), but now, perhaps after being exposed to decent music by my parents (and later, friends and extended family), I finally realized how bad Good Charlotte was, sophmoric lyrics, mediocre instrumentation, and the band relies more on their image gimmick than even KISS ever did (at least KISS's music was adequate). Don't buy this album, do not waste your money."
1,One Star?,"This is more like negative infinite stars, if you know what I'm talking about. Good Charlotte is the biggest group of lack-talent posers I have ever heard of. These guys are such sellouts that they even appeared on Time magazine. I was bored and had nothing better to do when I saw an article about the two Madden twins, Benji and Joel. Whoop-de-f*cking-do. You got yourselves featured in Time magazine. Along with that, you've:1. appeared on Nickelodeon2. played with other pop stars3. performed at pop radio station concerts with Maroon 5, Simple Plan and the All-American Rejects4. got Disney girlfriends5. a big mansion to stow all your well-earned money for selling yourselves outThere you have it. Another sellout group with absolutely no talent. You want a good album? Buy Armor For Sleep's ""What To Do When You Are Dead"" instead. Armor For Sleep are ""emo"", but these guys are actually talented, unlike hackmasters Good Charlotte."
1,Pure pop,"""girls don't like boys girls like cars and money"". yea. right. i'm sad to say that i'm the age that GC has targeted their music at, and that i used to own this cd. i gave it away to a friend, and now it's gathering dust on her shelf. the only good thing i can say about good charlotte is that the have good brainwashing powers. now all of you preps who like them, go find all of your old cds of Nsync (and you know you have them, don't lie.) and listen to them. then listen to this cd. see a difference? i thought you wouldn't.here are some bands you should be listening to if you are truly in it for the music and the feeling:QOTSA (yea, their not punk, but their pretty good anyway, and for your information, QOTSA stands for queens of the stone age.)NirvanaDead KennedysSex PistolsAc/Dc (see QOTSA)black sabbathoh, and i sincerely hope that the reviewer from oct. 17 was joking."
5,Good Charlotte's New CD Rocks,"Good Charlotte has made a GREAT CD, And I recomend you get it. I've NEVER heard a better CD"
2,Take it for what it is worth....,"Anyone who was expecting a remake of London Calling, turn away now. These kids are a joke - but what is really wrong with that? Decent music, decent hooks and a decent CD to throw on at a party. Serves its purpose. No different than what Poison or Warrant really brought to the musical landscape in the late 80s. Disposable rock tunes that are enjoyable today and you'll tire of and forget about by 2005."
1,Glorified White Trash!,"Good Charlotte is nothing but white trash! Take a look at the band members. Who do they think they are? It's almost like they're wearing ""rock star"" costumes. Sorry guys, I've seen better rock stars on Halloween. I'll never forget the first song of theirs I ever heard on the radio. It was called ""Little Things"" or something, and it told about all these white trash scenarios that they apparently suffered through. Since when is singing about your white trash lifestyle entertainment? People are so freaking stupid for liking this band. I hear ten-year-old girls blasting this stuff and talking about how cute the guys are. Ha ha! There you go fellas, there are some ladies for you! Go date them and then go to prison. Maybe after taking a few showers in prison you'll have some new experiences to sing about."
1,You Really Get Tired of The Same Things Over & Over Again,"This album before the release of the single ""Girls and Boys"" was on my list of cds to buy. After then i noticed wow, all of these songs sound exactly the same. The cd was immediately taken off my list. I would never recommend this album to anyone who doesn't want their time completely wasted. On the other hand, if you would like to listen to sellouts who can't even think of lyrics that go together at all, or even play more than just three different chords to play on their cheap Wal-Mart guitar. These losers are getting to much recognition for the horrible stuff they put out. There are way to many bands like this out there and they need to be stopped. If you want to be a rockstar, take a guitar class."
1,horrible nasty CD,"Okay, so these guys have 2 decent songs on the radio. I thought I would like their sound. I buy the CD and every other song is horrible. It was extremely disapointing for me. I expected some good punk, but what I found was a group who was basically a combination of soft Blink 182 and n'Sync. Sure, every 13 year old girl will love this...but as a self respecting collegiate, I can never listen to this CD again."
5,GC ROCKS!!!,"This is my favorite CD ever!!! GC rocks everybody knows it but they think if they admit it they will be labeled as a pop-punk lover. This isnt true GC is truly punk. Just because they werent stoned when they wrote the lyrics or say they are gonna f****** kill everyone, that doesnt mean they are punk. You really need to listen to the music and lyrics,just because they dont scream at the top of their lungs that doesnt make them any less punk!!! GC is truly one of the best bands ever. Just because because a song doesnt have the f*** word that doesnt make it not punk. This is a great CD and GC is very talented, joel has a very good voice. I really recommend this CD to anyone punk or not."
1,And they say nu-metal is manufactured...haha,"Lifesytles of the rich and famous indeed... i'm sure thats what these boys are living no thanks to their little manufactured boy band with guitars. I mean they're like Busted! (sorry any americans who may not kno who they r) and i mean well done for recommending New Found Glory's i mean cash-in's album with it. Both have no soul what so ever. Lets jump on the Greenday/Offspring bandwagon of pop punk they said, without thinking up a decent bandname or putting any soul into the record. I mean i like punk, Greenday, Offspring + hardcore like Glassjaw, bands that move you. This is pretend tripe for little sister's. The N'sync with guitars revolution has began!"
1,Bleah!,bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah!bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah!bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah!bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah!bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah!bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah!bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah! bleah!
1,HI!,"I used to like good charlotte blink 182 sum 41 and stuff but I like punk now, REAL PUNK! I heard of rancid nofx and stuff and i like that but I saw a picture of Tim Armstrong in a caualties t shrit so I decided to check them out. Real punk is Exploited and stuff like that."
1,Yo this band is dedicated....,"to anyone who is actually stupid enough to consider this ""music"", to anyone who is a sad pathetic loser whose room is covered with pictures of Benji and Joel, to anyone who calls themself a ""punk"" for having this cd, THIS IS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!hehe this is so fun :)"
1,Again wit da hizzy,"dogz homiez g'z, dis not be da hizzly foshizzly on zwollow thiz jizzle! Lemme kik it freestyle foyas..yo i be rappn, dont crackalakin, or da g will get the flaka a kack a mack yo's! HOmiez! Stay far away form deez wanna be rappin punkz, kizzizle? ""THis is tha anthem, throw all your hands up"". whatz wit da terrible rappin homes? Yo,yo dis album definitly NOT of da hizzy!"
2,DONT BUY THIS CD THEY ARE SELL OUTS,"if you want to be braine washed by more MTV bull go ahead and by this cd, but if you are a true punk fan do not buy this CD. Good Charlotte was once a good ban before they sold out and only did it for the money they're song Life Styles of The Rich and famous is carp because they are rich and famous. So if you buy this CD it's not punk anymore its POP."
5,quality,"the new good charlotte cd is so amazing. its a great follow up tot heir first awesome cd. you seriosuly need to buy it. every track is good, ""no fillers"". stop reading this and go out and get it fool!"
5,THIS CD IS AWESOME!!,"This is by far one of my favorite albums of all time, the rest of my cds have been collecting dust every since i got it. if you thought gc's first album was good then multiply that by 10 and thats how great this one is! i love all the songs but if i had to pick my favorite from this cd it would be emotionless. the first time i heard it i cryed, lol, you can make fun of me but i absolutly love good charlotte! i recommend you go out and buy it cd RIGHT NOW!!!"
1,Moto Racer 2,"I bought this and then returned it. This game stinks bad. It's awful. Don't buy it. I have Moto Racer 1, and Motocross Madness and love them both.Road rash is good too. It's a bit dated, but fun. Stay away from Moto Racer 2."
5,Riveting!,"Davy's book is a wonderful read. When I picked it up, I was pleased that it was a thin book. By the time I finished reading the last story, I wished it would go on and on. My favorite story in the collection was the ""Lone Surfer...""."
1,Only odd number answer,"I do not recommend this book, if you already have a black textbook.The reason I purchased this solution manual is to know the answer for even number questions.This solution manual does not have even number answers.Basically, this book is coping the answer at the end of black text book.You can not get much more information from this.Please do not buy this solution book.This is not useful!!"
4,Filled with creative ideas,"This is not so much a how-to book as it is an idea book. The gallery is full of wonderful polymer clay creations, jewelry, sculpture, vessels, etc. Once you are familiar with the basic how-to of polymer clay, it's time to move up to this book to take your work to the next level. It's like visiting an art museum full of polymer clay things. You will be inspired by the different things you can do with polymer clay. Although you probably won't copy most of the projects in this book, you can borrow snippets of techniques to apply to your own creations. The gallery is filled with such variety of ways the clay is used, you will keep coming back to this book as your expertise increases with polymer clay."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Living only a mile 1/2 from Columbine High School, with our community still dealing with heavy emotions, I found this book to be compelling. The way the parents of the ""jocks"" choose to not believe their kids could do anything wrong sickened me- and it kept bringing me back to my high school years in which there was an obvious separation. I was so happy that those kids got what they deserved- and although it went into great depth about each kid's family- I thought it was fascinating. I, too have recommended this to many friends!"
5,This Movie Is A Gem And A Whale Of A Tale!!!,"In this very good movie we see a young orphaned street kid named Jessie who finds true meaning and purpose in his life when he discovers a sad, lonely Orca whale named Willy. Willy is too old to train and is hostile about being separated from his family. Lori Petti is is very impressive as the Marine Biologist in this film and sadly we do not see enough of her in movies these days. I also learned that salmon was ""Whale's Chocolate"" which is a very informative piece of Whale Trivia. This movie is about Loneliness, the Search for Freedom, the Importance of Family and a host of other good values. 5 stars for this very well made piece of filmaking."
4,The Plotter's Field,"The plot is a bit worn thin, but Peters keeps up the interest with a good set of engaging characters and her marvelous use of language. Still a worthwhile investment."
1,RIP OFF,This is a total RIP OFF. The add very clearly states 5 pound box and what you get is a 0.5 pound tube. NEVER AGAIN!!
5,Animals and eternal life,"Niki Behrikis Shanahan has obviously studied the subject of animals and eternal life in great depth. For anyone who questions whether or not they'll meet their beloved furry family member in Heaven, this book should provide proof and reassurance. Although the extensive research is obvious, this book is written in a way that makes it an easy, comfortable read."

2,Zzzzzzzz...*snort* Zzzzzzzz....,"Yeah. It was pretty bad. Let me tell you though---the kid from E.T. did a fantastic job, as well as his pal (the old scientist that could've been Jim Carey's father in another life). The direction wasn't bad at all in that sense.But like so many previous reviewers have stated...this is not horror. This is more like a watered-down ""Twilight Zone"" with boobs. And the boobs are great and all, but they don't make up for this pile of crap story.""I tasted someone else's chocolate!"" I think that line was borrowed from a vague blaxploitation film from the 70's.Currently, ""Chocolate"" is competing against ""Dreams in the Witch House"" for crappiest ""Masters of Horror"" yet.Congratulations guys!"
1,Don't bother with this dvd,"Hands down the worst episode of the Masters Of Horror television show. It's dull, boring, and not scary. It will leave you scratching your head saying ""that's all?""Don't even bother with this dvd. It's a waste of your precious time."
3,Five Bucks is Five Bucks,"Sure, the transfers aren't too professional, and some of the discs come pretty beat up, but you get some interesting films you don't get to see very often. All of these have been edited; some have been cut by substantial amounts, and they even managed to trim an extra minute off each 'Hitchcock Presents' episode. But really, for the price, you can't lose. Get the full-length versions of the major movies somewhere else and ignore the copies in this package, then enjoy the little-known movies it contains."
1,A box with two corrupted discs,"Don't buy this box. Discs 1 and 2 are bad, corrupted and wouldn't play in your DVD-player. Buy the two 10-movies boxes instead. They are good. And it is the same films as in the 20-movie box.I wrote to warranies@amazon.com about the problem but they didn't even answer."
1,Crap-shoot,"It is too bad that one needs to preview most of these films before showing them to a group, or even another person at home, as you never know what you're going to get. Many of the disks are not only poorly prepared, taken as direct-transfers from something akin to U-matic masters, but are poorly pressed, meaning that there are scenes that stop, skip, bail out and and simply will not play. I was shocked to see that a whole reel of JAMAICA INN is simply missing, and a crucial scene of the hero, who is tied to a chair, is, in the next scene free and walking about. Indeed, for the die-hard enthusiast; but to see how good most of these are, I'd wait for a better product."
2,Great Collection but poor quality,"I just received this DVD set today, I watch the first disc. The movie is nice, but the video and audio quality is very very poor. Also the movie has no subtitles at all, except for the silent films of course.Most of the movies included in this set are hitchcock's early films, which are films I'm not familiar with.Anyway, the price of the DVD set is not expensive, so for me, the dvd is ok for now, but I will be looking for the remastered release of these films if there are in the future.This Adds my Alfred Hitchcock Collection."
5,A Book to read again and again!!!!,"As an avid reader of religious and theological material, I was very suprised to fine myself reading this book (that I picked-up at a garage sale) and being overwhelmed by the wisdom of the writer NEALE DONALD WALSCH. Note: I later bought the hard copy for my collection.I consider myself a spiritial progressive, but I believe this book would touch the heart and soul of anyone with an open mind and a desire to search for a better way of LIFE, a more rational definition of GOD, and the authentic way in which to LOVE one another.If you read this book you will realize the difference between your TRUE FEELINGS and what some would call EMOTIONSI hope you will read and share!"
3,Ok but a little flimsy,These hardwood stakes are ok but hard to push into the soil and if you push to hard they will break. Once I learned how to handle them they did an ok job.
1,Hastily put together,"This book read like it was put together in a weekend. The writer seemed peculiarly interested in promoting himself, rather than the ideas he was explaining. Lots of hype (anecdotes about quick success, making a splash, etc). Very little on the mechanics of raising money, negotiating with VC's, haggling over valuation...ie, the stuff that you really need to know as an entrepreneur. Overall, a low signal-to-noise ratio."
2,Not one that sent me reeling...,"Having read the above reviews, I was expecting to be knocked out by this album; instead it landed me a kid-gloves tap on the jaw. The lack of drums is not compensated for by the effete percussion work, and, oh, how the dexterity and edification of Bruninghaus's piano work are missed! The vocals, too, lend the tracks a lightweight and pop-like feel.Prior to purchasing Fluid Rustle, I had spent three weeks being propelled through the nuanced musical wonderland that is Silent Feet, so perhaps my disappointment was inevitable. Weber is undoutedly a modern-jazz heavyweight, and much of his work is spellbinding, but this particular effort doesn't pack too great a punch."
4,Prep that mohawk,"Genocide SS play the kind of punk that recalls the early 80s legends such as Discharge, GBH, Misfits, Exploited, etc. While some of those bands took themselves more seriously than others, Genocide SS seems to be about bashing out louder, faster punk rock that never takes itself too seriously. For those concerned about this being a neo-Nazi/white-power type band, the fascist imagery does not extend beyond the band's name and album title. An anti-swastika sticker on the back of the CD case affirms this, as does the point that it's on Relapse records - which was run by a couple of Jewish guys last time I checked. This CD is great, my only minor gripe is that a few of the riffs are completely aped from their 80s counterparts. For example, the first few seconds of ""Crazy Motorcycle"" tricked me into thinking they were about to cover GBH's ""No Survivors"" (at least until the vocals kicked in)."
1,HUH? For use on window or glass doors facing the sun ???,"""For use on window or glass doors facing the sun.""That's what the description says.Should we assume they rather mean to say, facing ""sunlight?""(and not facing a dark wall of your neighbor, for instance.)Most of these rechargeables do not have to be facing directsun light, as far as I know. Then why don't they be more clear?How many applications do you suppose can this be used inif they really mean: facing direct sun light?Who knows what they mean.You'd think these companies (and Amazon) would care a bit moreabout the clarity of their descriptions: after all, isn't therethousands, and thousands of dollars to be made on Amazon sales?"

3,Not enough words,"I read a lot of British mysteries and keep running across words that I have never seen. I bought this book hoping that it would help me understand Britishisms that I was not familiar with. I was able to find only about one third of the words I was looking for in the first Brit mystery I've read since buying this book. This dictionary is not comprehensive enough for an avid reader. If you're really into Brit lit, save your money and look up the words online."
1,"""1 star"" is an insult to products that actually deserve one star....zero is more fair!","I paid less than four bucks for these knives and feel ripped off. They're easily the most pathetic quality knife I've ever seen. I'd expect better than this from a dollar store. What you don't see on TV are the incredibly scrawny cheap handles and blades so thin that they bend effortlessly. The package is worth about as much as the blades. I'm no gourmet, but these knives strike me as being dangerous. I'd be downright embarrassed to set them on a table to cut meat with unless I was camping. In fairness, they will cut if you can get ahold of those inept handles and keep the blade 90 degrees to the target. It was almost worth the price just for the education....unbelievable."
1,These are NOT genuine Ginsu knives do not be fooled,"These knives are not genuine Ginsu knives, they are a cheap, poor quality imitation. If you want a genuine Ginsu product, do not buy anything under the GINSU 2000 name, ensure you choose Ginsu only."
1,This item is a fake Ginsu,These are not Ginsu knives and Ginsu should sue these people and run them out of business! It only gets a star because you can't give less!
5,good stuff,"Love these self-sticking photo papers. They make good clear prints. I like the matt but the semi glossy do fine as well. I use them for the photo cards I sell and I print up illustrations for our personal travel journal that's kept in the 5th wheel. A quick print of our campground lets us know, looking back, if we want to go there again."
3,A Required Reading Book for Poli Sci,This book was from a required readinglist for an undergraduate political science course. Don't have a review for the content yet.
4,one of the stronger dialogues,One of the better dialogues in that it manages to raise most of the big issues of virtue and citizenship in way which does not feel to rushed or overly contrived. It's the first dialogue I've read which actually made me smirk when Socrates offered a witty retort or a brilliant condemnation of someone else's views. to someone. It's also a lot of fun to hate on Callicles.
1,I just thought it was flakey,"I read this book and I thought it was a waste of time. First, the author has the irratating habit of using exclamation points at the end of sentences. Second, she doesn't go anywhere with this book. She talks about her experiences, but they are watery and pointless. What is she trying to say? It's all marketing and no substance.Some people may find it helpful, in talk of loneliness and so forth, but it was pointless to me."
1,This not a book for Cthulhists,"This is nothing more than a new age book guised with a Christian title. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OLD ONES. Psychic gifts are not Biblical and more to the point are in fact useless against the unspeakable alien intelligence of Cthulhu! Ial Shub-Niggurath! Ms. Snow is combining ""feel good"" philosophies, buddying them up with new age tactics and using the word ""Christian"" as a marketing tool.If you are a Cthulhist and believe that we are all as hamster pellets to the great and horrible Cthulhu, please don't waste your time on this book. You'd be better off running around screaming."
5,Product review,"The material content in these recordings is outstanding. It is a great teaching method, broken down in steps of difficulty, well illustrated and the instructions are very good to follow if you don't have any self defense background. If you do have prior training in any system, this is a very good add on to your experience. Any one with experience can see and analyse the moves and implement it to their workouts. I heard from an instructor once say that simplicity is genius, well, this system helps you learn simple techniques for multiple situations so that if you need to react one day, God forbid, you don't stumble and react out of muscle memory."
5,Great Entry level Pro-Video Card,Fully compatible on Compaq machine with Windows 7 32 bit. Really nice options under the NVidia control panel. Using it to run a projector on the second output. Flawless.
1,No Jesus,"The author of this book is a spiritual mystic but would not qualify as a Christian. He does not believe Jesus is God, that Jesus died for sins, and was resurrected. It is simply a book about looking for the inner light within yourself, not seeking after God. I was very disappointed as I thought this was a book of Quakers wisdom that was pointing us towards Jesus. Instead, we are exhorted to find our inner light and follow that. No room for God or Jesus in this Quaker's traditions. I am not Quaker but I did attend a Quaker college and wanted to learn more about Quakerism. If you're seeking guidance in following Jesus, don't look for it with this book. If you want help in following yourself, you've come to the right place."
2,"General, feel good, self-help book","The wisdom expressed in this book is to look inside. If the answers are found within and not without then this is an excellent book. If we are basically good people, and others are basically good then I would recommend this book. However, I believe the answers to the human condition are not this simplistic as I believe the human condition is in more of a moral predicament than this book allows. The answers Smith provides can be summarized as 'be a better person' or maybe 'I'm OK, you're OK, now accept that and live like that'.The fundamental teachings of most world religions go much further than this in terms of offering a powerful solution to a very real and deep problem....that of the corruption of the human heart. Smith seems to soft-pedal the problem in order for his solutions to not appear 'washed-out' or weak. However, in doing so, I think he does a injustice to the reality of the human problem."
4,Take a Moment to get grounded,"Don't let the size fool you.This book packs a punch.I live far away from other Friends at the moment. Often the religious people where I have lived don't believe Quakerism is even a religion, think that we are like the Amish, or worse, they are openly hostile to the ideas of Quakerism. As a result, I often look to this book to feel grounded. The book has that wonderful balance of personal stories and philosophical points. The author doesn't tell long stories because he likes telling long stories about himself.He keeps it simple.Whether you are a Friend, or not. Whether you are religious or not, this book is a grounding book covering ideas like peace simplicity and silence, of which we could all use more. I personally, love this book and am grateful to have it in my collection."
4,Accurate; Misconceived Notions by Previous Reviewer,"As a former HUMINT Tour Driver stationed in USMLM, I take exception to Reader/San Antonio's comments regarding Cmdr Fahey's experiences during his extraordinary time at the Mission. While I certainly understand that many spy afficianados tend to lump human intelligence methodologies into one large basket, the USMLM was unlike anything anywhere else in US military history during the Cold War era. Cmdr Fahey's comments regarding personal interactions aside, being detained by hostile forces 7 times has nothing to do with level of success that he achieved. In other words, being detained came with the turf; sometimes you wouldn't be detained for 6 months and the KGB/GRU/Stasi would target you specifically because of your ability to get the job done. In a country with hundreds of thousands of hostile personnel, we took our life into our hands every time we went on ""tour."" I highly recommend this book."
2,A Controvertial Review of Shopping Malls,"""Call Of The Mall"" follows on from the most fascinating, entertaining and useful retail research book ever written, ""Why We Buy. The Science of Shopping"" which is a must read for everyone involved with retail.""Call Of The Mall"" is also easy to read, though it has far more of Paco Underhill's opinions and far less actual research to back up his conclusions. It examines how Americans use the mall, what it means, why it works when it does and why it often doesn't work at all well.I have the feeling with this book that Paco Underhill has been reading too much of his publicity and now believes he is a witty, entertaining writer. So, in some ways it's a bit of a let down. However, for anyone involved in a management role within shopping centres it's still a `must read'."
4,Pretty darn good for a book on Streaking,I'm an avid Streaker and own four books on streaking. This is by far the best of the four. That doesn't say much since reading about streaking can never compare to actually doing it.
5,sweet deal,I love this product and it has come in very handy. I am more likely to fix the car myself with the information this scanner gives. I received it faster then expected too. thank you
4,Handy tool to have...,"There's nothing worse than having that ""Service Engine Soon"" or ""Check Engine"" light come on. This scanner can give you some idea of what is going on under your car's hood. Easy to attach connector and simple navigation screens. Too bad it can't tell you how much the repairs will cost you!"
2,What the hell happened to these guys.,"I was a fan of this band for a long time,everything from the S/T from 88 through to ixnay was great.But trust me in this case things dont get better with age.Pretty fly was awful and honsetly this isnt much better.Just a song about someone who wants to get laid alot.Its basic its boring and it was all over the radio.The only high point of this single is the track Da Hui in which The vandals drummer fills in for Ron welty ,a minute and a half of straight forward almost hardcore punk its a real shame they didnt release more like it."
5,A truly enchanting masterpiece. I long to see it again!!,"I am from England aged 28. I remember seeing this video along with two others on British TV when I was around nine years old. The others were ""The Selfish Giant""(also listed on Amazon from the same studio!) and Japaneese Directed ""The Little Mermaid""( much better than Disneys!!). I have lately been searching desperately to obtain these three animated films with no success. I have never forgotten how touched I was by the loyalty, love and self sacrifice shown in this Oscar Wilde classic.(Yes I know I was only nine which goes to show how good it was!) Just like the other reviewers on this site, I add my plea for someone, anyone to have this film (which was my favourite) and indeed the others which are equaly 'memorable treasures' to be re-released!"
2,I had high hopes . . .,". . . but this mascara is nowhere near as wonderful as the rest of the Ecco Bella line. Maybe it just isn't meant for use during summer temperatures, since it smudges so easily. After a few hours, it looked as though I'd badly applied black eyeliner -- but it was just the mascara coming off. I now wear bareMinerals Big Tease mascara, which not only does *not* smudge, but is also free of the parabens found in this Ecco Bella formula."
2,Color doesn't match image,"I ordered the cocoa eyeliner and it is really a bright copper color, not the brown color it appears to be on the website. I will try to send it back.The pencil seemed a little hard, I'm going to go back to my Honeybee's eyeliner. They have a much better natural gluten free product."
1,Not even going to buy it.,"This product might be vegan-friendly but when they say it's ""pure"" how to they explain the use of two parabens in the ingredients? I was searching for a natural, non-toxic mascara and this came up somehow. Watch what companies say and what they put into their products, because this is still an unregulated industry. The word ""pure"" doesn't mean anything, neither does ""natural."" You really have to look closely."
2,Sticky,"Too sticky and it clumpy on my lashes will not reorder, it also came off if my eyes teared and was expensive."
3,Nice mascara,"This is not the best mascara I've ever used, but nice enough that I will use it up and then probably go back to Clinique. It seemed a bit thick to me, but I didn't have the problems others were having with smudging, flaking, not drying, etc. I did end up using my eyelash comb with it because it did clump. But I can deal. Don't expect a lot from it, I guess is what I'm saying."
2,Pretty terrible,"This is just what you'd expect, only not nearly as exciting as you'd hope. It's so obviously staged from start to finish that it's really not that entertaining."
4,"Encouraging, Funny, and Even Inspiring!","This one is a fast seller in our bookstore. Every time we get a copy of it in stock, out the door it goes, and with good reason!The authors offer suggestions on staying young that are just what you were looking for, but were afraid to ask about, or admit!(An example: the chapter entitled ""Menopause: Is it Hot in Here, or is it Just Me?"")The only reason we are not rating this book five stars, is because we think there are a couple of chapters that are a TINY bit short on actual how-to information. But ALL the chapters offer at lease SOME good advice, AND give you a laugh at the same time."
5,Great Memories!,"My husband and I grew up watching Route 66. As a young teenage girl, I was smitten with Todd and Buzz while my husband only had eyes for the corvette. Sometimes the episodes are a little hokey compared to todays dramas, but that's okay. There are so many famous actors and actresses in these episodes when they were young and new. Watching Route 66 takes you back to a simpler time. We watch these as a treat to ourselves at least a few times a month."
5,Love this spray...have used it for years!,This is a wonderful product which will protect printed images without yellowing. I've used it for several years and was glad to see it available here.
5,"My BFF, Hair Flair yasmin","Yasmin Has been my best friend since that wonderful day. One day at Target I came Across the Bratz Isle. Just as we were about to leave the isle mom said i could get a couple of them if they are $10 or cheaper. So i got her and cloe. When i Opened her up i put the cloe box in the closet and started hugging her. then about a year later i lost her. But Just recently i found her and have many new ways to do her hair. my favorite is to take those two locks of hair in the front and put them together. then wrap that around her ponytail and hold it to the side with a bobby pin. then lift the lock of hair up her ponytail until her hair goes no where past her chin.Sincierly, MegP.S.I highly recommend to anyone without a friend or anyone with a best friend and he or she is just not around all that often. TAKE CARE!!"
3,Another Bratz Babyz doll,"My daughter got this for Christmas last year. She was only five then, but loved the Bratz and still does. The Bratz are always dressed skimpily, so that is to be expected. The doll is pretty durable, and with the Bratz empire constantly growing, it is a toy that my daughter still plays with 8 months later. It comes with a brush to do the doll's hair, and the clothes it is wearing. My daughter, now 6, tries to style her hair like the doll's, so I get nervous that she will want to dress like the doll. There are other toys on the market that offer better messages to little girls, but if she must have a Bratz doll, they are made with fairly good quality."
1,More ran-dumb Adult Swim nothingness,"Well, fans want this stuff and Cartoon Net keeps dishin' it up: more random ""comedy"" with limited Web-type animation. I'm floored that people can't see this stuff for what it is: a bunch of guys sitting around a microphone freeballing it, then someone turns it into a cartoon. This takes talent? At least the early days of Adult Swim actually had some cleverness and unexpected laughs. But this type of thing is, sadly, about the ONLY kind of cartoon that is popular these days. Guys: you KNOW you could do this at home, right? And post it online? And become the Next Big Thing? Yeah. Do us all a favor and try something else. Sooooooooo sad."
2,Audio is off,"Lilandra's voice is weird and obviously voiced over like her brothers and even the phoenix.Why is it so hard to have the real audio from the series, only real frustration with the DVDs. Otherwise I'm just happy they finally released the series on DVD"
3,Causion vol1&2 are not the entire series,"they are not the compleate series and i don't think they are in the order they aired. missing are:no mutant is an island,X-men:sanctuary 1&2/weapon-x,lies and videotape/protious 1&2 if you look up X-MEN sanctuary parts 1&2 it also included weapon-x,lies and videotape/protiouse 1&2 on amazon you will see the original releases of the series had those missing titals and look for X-MEN :reunions parts 1&2 it had no mutant is an island hopefully there is a volume 3 comming containing those missing titals."
4,Metallic Sharpie Pens,You could not fine these metallic sharpie pens in any office store before the school year began whicj was teh first week in September. These pens are durable and hold the color perfectly...I give these sharpie metallic color markers Five stars
1,What were they thinking?,"The idiots who designed this made it with no clip on the cap, which I need to carry it in my pocket.Probably designed in a third world country where they don't have pockets in what few clothes they own.It doesn't say where the product was actually made. About half of the package is in some foreign language, not English.Now I know not to buy Newell Rubbermaid products (who makes Sharpies)."
3,Worked for awhile,This is a pretty good sharpener but it only lasts a few sharpens on a few knives. I recieved the hunting camping knife today which I knew would be dull and tried to get a good edge on it but no such luck. Something that needs a hard edge I guess Im gonna have to get the Smiths portable diamond sharpener.
5,Love this bible,I love this bible it gives a better understanding and expounds more on the scriptures. The only thing that could be better is if they had not only the new testament but the old testament also available for the kindle.
5,The Science of the Cross (The Collected Works of Edith Stein Vol 6),"For those readers who want a greater understanding about Our Lords sacrifice on the Cross and the thought of St John of the Cross about the Love of his life, this book by Edith Stein a canonised Carmelite is absolute must"
2,Looks better than it sounds,"Dont let the fancy package fool you , this is nothing more than Bootleg quality at best. Some discs are shakey soundboard recordings that sound like a warped tape and some are audience recordings that were taped in the bathroom ( or sound like it) . Stick to ""One Night at Budakon"" or ""Rock Will Never Die"" for quality live 1980's MSG."
1,This More than Just Sucks,"Horrid Sound. Wouldn't mind if I had paid a few bucks, but for $40.00 plus, this is a huge ripoff. For anyone familiar with Hawkiwind, this is worse sound than ""Give Me the Head of Yuri Gagarin""....by far. I have not heard many CD Collections that could compare to the disgarce that this set is!!!Gave it one star simply because the packaging is OK."
4,The only good thing about a remake is...,The only good thing that may come from remaking this classic (remake is coming to theaters in Oct 09) is that the original may finally get the wide dvd release it deserves..hopefully with many extra features! Let's keep our fingers crossed! [...]
4,Good Movie Bad Price :( Sorry,Well I Love Shelley Hack And When I Knew She Was In It I Just Had To Get This! I Didnt Buy This On Amazon.com But I Did Buy It At Borders (Music Books & More) It Cost About $20. But Anyway I Think Even The Price On Amazon Should Be Lowerd A Little Bit Just Because This Is A Classic Shelley Hack Movie & Fans Deserve To See It Withought Paying To Much For It!As For The Movie It ROCKED If You Are A Horror Fan You Will Fall In Love With It! Terry O Quin Does A Great Job As Well As Shelley Hack.
1,A Blu-Ray Disc Won't Make This Film Any Better,"i must be one of the few people who thought the remake with Penn Badgely andDylan Walsh released last fall 2009 was a better film. now i'm not saying theremake was Oscar material but is was superior in all aspects. the original lookslike it cost $1.95 to make. in fact the original's productions values werebelow par even for low budget/independent horror films. also the acting byJill Schoelen as the daughter and Shelly Hack as the mother was atrocious.the only way this film can at least look better is if they do a literalframe by frame high def digital remastering of the film. the first and onlydvd released last fall was most disappointing. either the ""master"" had agedpoorly or the person in charge wasn't paying attention."
5,blow by blow account of a writers journey,"Jeez. I thought ol' Hunter had laid down and died but up comes this ball bustin'account of the apprenticeship, knocks and blows that led to the good doctor. he lives, grows and forms until there is only the alter of GONZO to prostrate oneself before. To Hunter, You outlived that twisted bastard Nixon, I hope you outlive them all."
3,Verry twee,"Mildly entertaining but verry twee. McKinley's sentences are VERY short, choppy in fact. One can't help but wonder if this book is being written for third-grade readers ... But, then, one does welcome McKinley's embrace of dicey sexual words and, especially, almost acts."
3,"not the best, and not staying in my collection.","I got this book blind, it was handed to me by a friend and I was told to read it. I did, but I didn't love it. I felt like I was only getting half of the story the entire time, like there was a bigger piece to the puzzle and it wasn't available to me.The main character seemed cold and whiney for more than a good portion of the book. She spent a majority of her time making other people's jobs difficult (SOF mostly) and alienating the people around her.There were definitely highlights to the book. Well mixed comedy and gore. But when the author was tired, it was just done.Unique, but not thrilling."
3,sunshine,"Just far to much about the bakery and to little about the vamp. I was hoping that this book was the first in a series because Mckinley introduced some great characters but she never developed them. I wanted to learn more about this unique world the author created, but instead I learned about cinnamon rolls. I don't know maybe the cinnamon rolls were suppose to symbolize something that escaped me. The scenes between connie(vampire) and sunshine make the book worth reading."
2,"Loved the concept, but lacked great execution.","I really WANTED to like this book. I love vampire books, and it has to be really bad or cheesy for me not to like it. This book? All I can say is confusing! I was so lost for most parts of the book, and then after the good stuff happens in the first 90ish pages, the next 250 are just a confusing pointless mess. The plot just got way mucked up. The ending was a bit anti-climatic. With the ease of how Sunshine offed you know who. And what about her powers? Background with her dad? Her bond with Con? I feel like it was a very half-finished book. I think this book had great potential, but the author just didn't execute well."
2,"Lots of Sunshine, but not much else","Disappointing is how I would phrase it. A rather rambling and disjointed tale of vampires in a futuristic world that you only get glimpses of from the ongoing chatter of the main character. There is no prologe to tell you how the world got that way, or why vampires and goblins abound in this vaguely outlined world. While the idea of the storyline has potential merrit, I found myself feeling slightly confused and left dangling by the ending. Not anywhere near to Robin's usual standard."
2,When a heroine just can't stop talking,"Robin McKinley is among my favorite authors. Sunshine, however, just isn't at the level of McKinley's previous books. The irritating heroine kept talking, on and on and on. And not just talking - angst-ridden talking. While parts of the story were gripping, too often I wanted to scream at the heroine to shut up. But I continued to read, because there seemed to be such an accummulation of rich stories behind the talking. Unfortunately, few of the stories were ever resolved.Despite these flaws, I was engrossed in the book (enough to want to scream at the heroine, after all). I would definitely read a sequel, if only to discover more of Sunshine's family (although the bakery could be bombed with my blessing), more of Constantine's story, who on earth their great enemy was, and more of the stories behind the secondary characters."
2,Too much paper wasted on the back story,"Interesting idea, good characters.. But it took eighteen pages to give the reader the set up for the story, which for me, is way to long. Then once the action gets going, which is the only thing that moves the story, there's more and more and more back story. Maybe it's just McKinley's style as I writer that I find fault with. I want to be thrust into the action, and then have to figure it out along the way as the story unfolds, giving the reader a little back story as it moves along. Otherwise, I feel to bogged down, and plain bored. So, I skimmed a lot of it, just to get to the stuff that didn't bore me.For vampires, I prefer J.R. Ward, Kim Harrison, Laurell K. Hamilton, Mary Janice Davidson (Queen Betsey series), Keri Arthur (Riley series), (Morganville Vampires) Rachael Caine, or Rob Thurman (Cal Leandros series)."
2,Whatever...,"I've never read this author before, but I have read a lot of vampire fiction. And while she is a better author that Anne Rice, this book didn't sweep me off my feet like I hoped it might. Too much plot, too many character and no sympathy for anyone.There is some good stuff here. Alternate universe detail, interesting magic that felt like reality, and I really, really want one of those cinnamon rolls. But in the end, too frustrating to want to own."
1,Ramblings,This could have been a good short story. 80% was filler and ramblings. If you like this type of book read jeanine frost halfway to the grave.
3,So-so vamp book,"I will start by saying that Robin McKinley has been one of my favorite authors for 15 years or so, but I was only lukewarm in my feelings about this book. Initially I wasn't going to read it at all due to the early negative reviews, but I figured anything by McKinley deserved a chance.My main issue is that I didn't feel that much happened in the book. The premise and setting were interesting, but most of the time we're stuck in Sunshine's head as she mulls things over. She has a lot to mull over, sure, but it got a little tiring. McKinley admits on her website that she was addicted to ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", and this just seemed like she was trying too hard to create her own Buffy. Sorry, Joss Whedon did it first and did it WAY better.There's no planned sequel, which I'm glad of, since maybe this will mean McKinley will give us a brilliant fantasy novel again instead of another blah horror novel."
2,ick...,"I picked up this book because I loved Robin McKinley's other books. However, this one was a disappointment. I got into it a little after the veeeeery tedious beginning where the narrator, Rae, talks about her coffee house for what felt like forever. After that it got a bit more exciting, but never really caught my attention. I kept waiting for the action to turn, but it never did. There was a final ""battle"" but it felt rather anticlimactic. However, I did like the setting, with all the description of the Voodoo Wars and the Others like Weres and Vampires, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1. All in all, rather disappointing though. I could barely finish it, and that hardly ever happens. My advice: read one of McKinley's other books like ""The Blue Sword""."
2,disappointed to say the least,Sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this book... I really wanted to like it and by the end felt I had wasted my time. This could have been an amazing story but I feel it lacked the connection i so like to make with characters. Sunshine annoyed me to be quite honest and I found myself skimming though parts.I would not recommend buying try to find a copy at the local library if you are thinking about purchasing...
5,Spellbinding and Oddly Comforting,"Sunshine by Robin McKinley was a book that was recommended to me when I asked for suggestions of great vampire novels and after reading the description I was immediately intrigued. Sunshine takes a different approach to the vampire genre, spinning a world both like and unlike our own where vampires lurk in the shadows of a world battered by the ""voodoo wars"". Sunshine is a seemingly ordinary young woman but she soon discovers that her talents go beyond creating killer cinnamon rolls and ""bitter chocolate death"". I loved how McKinley wove the story together, filling this book with sunlight and cinnamon rolls along with vampires, demons, magic handlers, and the like. There is something about this book that I found captivating and soothing, it somehow has a therapeutic effect for me. Sunshine has become one of my favorite novels. If you love vampire and you're looking for something different rather than the same old tired vampire romance try Sunshine!"
2,"It's got potential, but...","I've never read this author before, so I don't know if this was...slumming, shall we say? or the normal writing style. But either way, lordy in a bucket. 'Sunshine', though the idea behind the storyline was intriguing, was mind-blowingly slow and the climax was, at best, nonexistant. The characters were not well developed, the writing skill overall was nothing if not elementary, the concepts were just too far fetched to even be mildly interesting, and I honestly don't give a crap about how many dollars are in a 'blink' or when money assumed the title of an unconscious bodily function. If you've read this book, I'm truly sorry... but if you haven't yet, heed my word! Spare yourself from this painstakingly boring read."
3,Different Vampire Tale,"Well written vampire story set in a world with magic handlers and monsters. I read many reviews that compared this to Buffy The vampire Slayer, but I didn't think this story was anything like Buffy. I guess people will use that comparison for anything with vampires and a female protagonist.This really stands out for me in the stories I've read in this genre. The prose was top notch, and this didn't feel like just another vampire story with too many chicks in black leather and sexy, vampire, man candy."
2,Promise unfulfilled,"Though I generally love Robin McKinley, I fear this novel didn't live up to my expectations. As far as adult-type novels go, McKinley's Deerskin did a much better job of exploring some of the darker themes behind maturity and independence and growth. While Sunshine had to its advantage an interesting world to explore and the potential for interesting characters (especially in both Mel and Con), it failed to fully develop either its characters, setting, or plot. One cannot help but think how much better this book could have been ..."
3,"Good, but some unresolved plot issues","I liked this simply for the fact that it redeemed vampire novels for me- McKinley seems to understand that vampires are supposed to combust, NOT SPARKLE. There were some things I wish could have been done more in depth, such as Con's past, the whole thing envolving Onyx Blaise and exactly what Mel is. I guess that might be resolved in a sequel if that is a possibility, but for now, I remain slightly disappointed."
5,"""You have the right to a delicious 10 piece of Hotties hot wings...""","Somewhere along the way I discovered Reno 911 and I got all the seasons and watch them over and over and over..... One of my all time favorite episodes is in this season as the first episode on the second disc. It is the Hottie's hot wing sponsorship episode. This is priceless, they get all the wings they want for free, and they have to wear these hot pink outifts and their police cruisers have been painted hot pink with Hottie's logos. From eating all the Hottie's food, they develop a serious gas and diarrhea problem. You have to check out Dangle in his hot pink uniform, he seems to be the only one happy to wear it. Another fav of mine from this season is the episode with the Prop C, where the public is asked to vote to give the officers a raise and through a mixup, Wiegel and Williams destroy the wrong ballots and they don't get the raises. ""Turn off the phones......"" You have got to check out this season....."
4,"Excellent reference, but some topics left out","It's undeniable that this book is a MUST for a sedimentation engineering practitioner...Nevertheless, there are some topics left out by the author that, in my humble opinion,are of uttermost importance in order to understand, for example, the processes of saltation insediment particles. These topics are covered even in books that are focused more on geomorphologythan in sedimentation engineering.In short, Chapter three should include a section on eddy viscosity, the bursting phenomenon andmore advanced topics related to turbulence concomitant with sediment motion."
5,AWSOME !!!!!!,"This is one of my fave AK CDs.The tracks are:- Love Doesnt Have To Hurt- The Last Goodbye- You Are- Cradle- Someone like meThis Cd would be better if they didnt put RIGHT NOW 2004.All in all, its a GREAT album."
1,No No No!,"In short: this is a terrible product. If you are looking to karaoke to Cole Porter, you would be better off with liner notes and the music in your head."
4,performs a lot of analysis,"Well, the cover looks antiseptic enough. A plain wrap approach. The text is authoritative, coming from SPSS itself. A comprehensive explanation of version 13 of the Base. It does not teach statistics, per se. So you'd better come equipped with a reasonable background in it. But it shows how to perform considerable analysis on a data set.The book shows the user interface for inputting the data and getting results. The latter can be in tabular form or graphs. Parameters that can be measured include Cohen's Kappa, the McNemar-Bowker test, Cochran's, Mantel-Haenszel, Wilkes' lambda, Mahalanobis metric and Rao's V. Plus much more."
4,"Great track, but where's the Extended version?","Trance fans should know this track from numerous recent live sets and compilations. The Ocean To Shore Extended Mix is the version most DJs have chosen for their sets, so it's pretty glaring that it was left off this CDM.Anyway, if you don't know the track, it's basically a blissful trance track with intermittent vocoded (for lack of a better word--we're not talking ""Pack Jam"" here, though) lyrics and a gorgeous synth line taken from Talk Talk's ""It's My Life"". A singing guitar line is nicely utilized as well.The Minimalistix mix is a decent change of pace, with their now-trademark pianos.The PPK mix was just too weird for me. I'll have to give it another chance though."
4,Excellent Progressive Christian Music,"I bought this CD for my wife soley on hearing the very catchy ""I Believe"" track. My second favorite song, ""No You"" deals with the hard choice of pursuing a relationship with someone of a different religous perspective. The ""soul-esque"" background of this song supports the anguish felt in making the decision.The remainder of the the tracks are excellent and my wife would give it a 5 stars. I give it 4 stars because a few tracks (i.e. track 2) seems to rely on more pop sound than creative flair to carry it through.But if you like hearing contemporary Christian Music you will not be disappointed with this CD. The artists also appear to be good, decent people whom would make good role models (unlike 90% of most Pop musicians) for young listeners."
2,Pimsleur Swiss German,"Feedback from native German speakers is that I have learned a lot in a short time. They all question the very notion of learning Swiss German, however, because it is ""just a dialect"". I hope that it will get me started in my upcoming year of living in Switzerland. The program was great, although, I have the same critique that I remember reading. The male and the female speakers frequently pronounce words quite differently, and in close promimity to a lesson to pronounce it a different way. Also, it seems at times that they spend an inordinate amount of time on simple phrases, and gloss over some more difficult ones. All-in-all, I thoroughly enjoyed it, although it took me a LOT longer to go through the lessons than the prescribed ""one/day""!"
2,Shiva Oil Paintstik,"I was generally dissappointed with the color selection. For a beginner with oil sticks, I was expecting true primary colors to work with. It is hard to mix colors when they are not of the right hue. I will be able possibly to use these colors to overwork existing oil paintings. I probably would not recommend for first time buyers."
5,best,A great DVD brought good memories great buy most gave it for you personal collection. I can't wait for the next volume too come out
1,Died in less than 2 years,"I have had this hard drive for less than 2 years. Used it just for backing up pictures, music and documents. I noticed it ran a little warm, but wasn't too alarmed. I went to back up new files this week and it was completely dead! I tried to call the 800# in the manual and they were useless and barely spoke English. I will never buy Western Digital again."
1,Power supply goes bad. Do not buy this.,We bought three of these and in 2 out of 3 the power supply failed within a year.
1,ITEM NEVER RECEIVED!!!,This item was purchased on 1/20/09. I received the opportunity to review the product on 2/22/09. But THE EXTERNAL DRIVE NEVER ARRIVED. I CAN'T TRACK IT BECAUSE EVERYTIME I TRY I RECEIVE A MESSAGE TO TRY AGAIN LATER.I AM COMPLETELY FRUSTRATED!!!
2,Good but not great - external power adapter,"I am sad that I bought this requiring an external power supply. My mistake.After 16 months the power supply failed. Same problem with a similar Lacie drive. My original documentation gives a 3 year warranty. When I contacted the foreign customer support, they said ""out of warranty - 1 year"". Talked to supervisor ... same answer. As I raised my slower speaking voice to make sure Mamud understood, I read the warranty.Finally, he said he would send a replacement power supply at no charge.I will not buy WD ever again."
3,Another case where the power adaptor failed,"This external disk worked flawlesslyfor twelve months. Then on the thirteenthand just when the one year warranty had expiredlike in many others the power supply failedThank a god, the hard disk itself had no problemso I was able to recover my data.I am still using the disk as a backup in a new casingwith a new power adaptor."
1,Power Supply died one day,"It worked fine a few days ago, now nothing, like everyone else the power supply completely died AVOID THIS PRODUCT, I will NEVER buy WD again"
3,"Good ""UNTIL"" the Last Page","I am not sure what book the previous reviewers read. I was, as were they, totally captivated by the premise and, as well, was unable to put it down...until the last page! WHAT? That's it? That's all? More than once I had to go back and pick up the book and see if I had somehow missed the last chapter. Mr. Whitlow sets up at least a half-dozen intriguing story lines in this book...of which NONE are resolved! How could anyone who read this book not feel cheated? I even looked to see if there was a ""To be continued"" tease at the end...there was not. There was the mention of a book called ""Life Everlasting"" which is ""coming soon"" (in a year and a half,) but there is no indication whether it is the conclusion of this story. I was thoroughly dissapointed. Sorry."
5,Thoroughly enjoyed this book!,I particularly liked the two books together. Life support as well as life everlasting. I especially liked the court scene in the second book... you'll have to read it to see what I'm talking about. Awesome!!
3,Disappointed,"I have received 3 of the magazines so far, and I have been pretty disappointed. But maybe that's just me. I am a potter that does a lot of hand-building, and this book usually has only 1 pottery idea, and it has been nothing spectactular or very original so far. Has ideas for ceramic artists, about painting their greenware, but even some of that seems tacky. I was hoping for some fun, new creative ideas, but so far have not seen that. Lots of advertising."
5,Moments Like This are to be treasured for a lifetime!,"This is one the best live recordings ever! Peggy Lee is the Queen of Swing and her songs and renditions of others make this CD something to listen to. Although this not completely live (PL had a cold), she chose the live tunes that best showed off both the band and herself. Peggy Lee is the consumate performer, knowing that she and the band are one, and we get to experience her singing in an intimate setting, sounds nice, hmmm? The live performance of ""Fever""...well, you have to get the CD now, don't ya?"
5,Mariah is back,"No title could be more appropriate for Mariah's ""return"" than""Through the rain"". And not only the lyrics take that theme up, so does the music of her new song.Mariah sings with a passion and devotion that makes you literally feel going ""Through the rain"".And in the end...she prevails.One of Mariah's most beautiful songs, higly recommendable.The return of a real superstar with the most beautiful voice on earth."
5,Mariah Carey- Through the Rain,I'm so glad they finally released this single in the US because I got an import from Germany when I heard they were not. This is a great collectors item if your a Mariah fanatic! Mariah definetly made it through the rain!
2,Not Worth My Time,"Note: Sorry, people, I mistakenly thought I was reviewing the novel itself, not a study of the novel. Read my review anyway, as you will be interested in my opinion of the novel. Thank you.I had been wanting to read this classic for years. Finally I began it, read 100 pages, and put it down. My impression: the character's internal monologue, which comprised the first 100 pages, at least, was a thing where the character was responding to the world around him with all of these smart and clever thoughts, with many literary allusions. It amounted to Joyce showing off--saying, look at how smart I am, look at how interesting my character's mind is. Wow! Aren't you impressed? It didn't captivate me, it just became annoying. This is a sacred cow of literature, it feels good to go against the grain and dislike it. Others feel they are supposed to like this book because it is considered great. So go ahead and labor through it, suckers, and congratulate yourselves for having read every word."
5,My daughter asks me to read it to her again and again,"Shoshana gets a present from her grandmother. After waiting in suspense to open it until her third birthday, she finds out that it's not a toy but something better. Now she is big enough to light Shabbos Candles and do lot's of good things, Just Like Mommy.The text is concise and well written.The illustrations are beautiful."
2,Not what I needed...,"I was looking for something to get canned sodas really cold--so cold that they border on freezing. This doesn't even come close. Science isn't my bag, so I clearly expected too much. It may be fine at chilling wine, but I didn't try that."
4,Good duet,"This duet was done when both were at the peak of their fame. It's a soundtrack song from ""Anatomie"". It's quite nice and mellow with a catchy hook"
1,A waste of time,"After reading and falling in love with Nick Bantock's and Barbara Hodgson's illustrated novels, I gave this one a try. What a waste of time. Unlike Bantock and Hodgson, Crimmins doesn't offer an interesting and well-crafted story to go along with his illustrations--his story seemed to be more of an afterthought, and a silly one at that. I could have forgiven this somewhat if the art had been worthwhile, but as another reviewer pointed out, his preoccupation with nudes got pretty redundant as the book progressed. Talk about gratuitous. If you like illustrated novels, stick with Bantock and Hodgson, who are good storytellers as well as artists."
2,Rockin' but without the old sound and hooks,"I was really thinking that this CD would be a return to the catchy, hook filled sound that 38 Special had up until two albums ago. Unfortunately, it isn't. There are a few really good cuts here. But overall I was expecting so much more. Looks like they have forgotten what made them so good and directed their sound to the Biker fans. Songs like Haley's Got A Harley and Trooper With An Attitude just don't do anything for me. I think they miss Jeff Carlisi's writing and playing style more than anyone will admit. Not much else to say except that this one was a disappointment. Just doesn't have the sound I loved so much from this band."
2,teeny tiny,I recomend this for a childs gift. Its much smaller than it looks in the picture. On the plus side $8.44 ($2.49 + $5.95 shipping) for a genuine pearl bracelet isnt bad! Beware its very tiny.
5,... no words to describe ...,"I couldn't give less than 5 stars! No way!Simply put, this is the best metal record I have ever heard in my entire life. Not only the best death metal, the best metal in any cathegory. I'm really sorry they had to call it quits because another excellent band falls (without cash or support)... it's really bad cause the quality shown here should have made them rich and popular. It's really sad.Please, if you haven't heard this outstanding CD, do yourself a favor and hunt it down until you find it. I beg you!"
5,romancing a stone/jewel of the nile,"Always enjoyed these movies, hadn't seen them on the market in years, happy to get both together. Thanx"
2,NOT FOR ME,"don't take my title to this review literally, it was a gift for my mother for her birthday. since she has been starting her own collection of dvds these last few years, i do remember as a kid she was quite fond of both of these movies and since they where a packaged deal ( yeah right ) for both on one dvd..i had to get it !i must say it was a little pricey for the dvd..something like $28.00 with shipping and everything..i knew i should of bought in target when i saw it there a couple of months back for $10 but that's my own fault.it was delivered quickly and untarnished...the only problem was that it was a goddamn ripoff ! might as well been on blueray for that price !"
4,"Odd, but good","Found this book to be a bit odd, even forMacDonald. Nevertheless, it is a book well worth the reading, and one I am happy to have read. A strange character, Diamond, but delightful."
2,turtle fur Tassel hat,It was not what I expected. The item didn't not have a cap look in front. It looks different that the actual picture.
4,Kiss Color Bang Dialog,"This is a wonderful and much underrated film: and in Blu-Ray format the color is dazzling. Add to that the self-referential script (including set decoration that you have to scan carefully to get all the hidden jokes) and the flip dialog and canny narrative from Robert Downey,Jr. and they add up to a delightful evening of smiles, chuckles and outright guffaws! Watch closely!"
2,Sorry...but I was not amused,"As much as I want to jump on the bangwagon and praise how clever this movie is and wow look how they poke fun of all the action/thriller sterotypes...but I'm not too aware of many action thriller with gay private eyes and mumbling narrators. Silly me, I was actually trying to make sense of the story I was watching...which truley turned out to be a waste of time. Why? Because the movie audience has no idea about this mystery crimer writer that everyone in this movie holds in such high regard. And when the whole story unfolds-it does absolutely nothing for me. Downey and Monaghan have absolutely no chemistry. And Gay Perry made no sense to me-unless he was just there to solely feed the audience the plot. I laughed maybe once and then afterward forgot the joke I found amusing. Overall, it might be up your alley...it just wasn't up mine."
2,Great cast - dissapointing movie,"I expected great things from this film considering the cast. I, however, was very disappointed; In fact I didn't watch it all the way through. I found the plot and style far too affected for my taste. This could have been a very funny movie, but the screenplay got in the way."
2,Anxious mess,"It is easy to appreciate that Shane Black has made some of the classic action genre movies and was playing off that in KKBB. However, I found myself pretty much hating the manic tone, the sheer stupidity of the characters, and the constant breaking of the narrative to speak directly at the audience. One reviewer stated Black threw everything but the kitchen sink in and that hits the mark perfectly. It was a contrived plot that forced serendipity where it shouldn't occur.Val Kilmer's character was under used, forcing the audience to spend far too much time with the least interesting member of the cast. Some people might like this movie as I can tell from the reviews, but to me, I found myself fast forwarding through sections that were painful to watch.Watch LA Confidential, The usual Suspects or Snatch if you want a hard hitting mystery/drama."
3,Don't listen to your son-in-law,"I am a Val Kilmer fan and my son-in-law told me what a good movie this was so I bought it.Actually, it was very juvenile, but I still enjoyed Val."
4,"Fresh, Sexy Bang Bang","Shane Black best work since the Lethal Weapons, this very slick tale of a small time robber Harry(Robert Downey Jr) who has no idea what his getting himself into trys to pass himself off as actor. Who some how gets himself involed in a murder investigation.This is where Gay Perry(Val Kilmer)a private eye comes into picture. Harry and Perry team up to investigate this usually Mystery that twists back and forward leaving you with laughter and so more Original jokes that will keep you laughing even more.This movie is very fresh and exremtly injoyable, the two main characters Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr are brillantly played off each other just like Riggs and Murtaugh.Also its good to see good roles going to good actors."
1,"The title should have read: Missed, Missed. Ying, yang.","I almost threw-up when I saw this movie. This movie was awful. I should have known better...when I read the title: Kiss, Kiss. Bang, Bang I should have known this movie would be a real stinker. I wish I could get my money back. I want better for my money. Enough already...I'm throwing this piece of movie doo-doo in the garbage pale."
4,An Underappreciated Action Comedy,"'80s wunderkind Shane Black updates the buddy-action movie with great performances and unexpected twists. One of the better performances of late from Val Kilmer (also see Spartan) and features a very funny Robert Downey at his best. Val Kilmer does a riff on ""talking money"" that makes me laugh just thinking about it. See this movie, on Blu if possible."
1,The man with the boring power.,"It's hard to enjoy a show if there are no characters you really care about! Harold Finley (Donald Pleasence) may be timid but he's still a jerk!In the opening scene,he subconsiously kills two road workers because he refuses to wait for them to get out of his way. I know, he can't control his power. But he sure gets angry easily, never mind that he's in the wrong with most of his arguments. Unless you like to hear people argue, and find a storm cloud frightening, don't waste your money!"
4,Basically a tour of the lodge,"This is like one of those New Yorker articles on some obscure subject you're sure you're not interested in, but once you start reading, you find it fascinating. In this case it's an expanded interview and tour of Freemason's Hall, London, led by the very articulate John Hamill, the Head Officer of the United Grand Lodge of England. While learning the history and credo of the Freemasons, we see the incredible rooms of the lodge, done in an Art Deco motif, harkening back to both Egypt and King Solomon. As you would expect, there's a great deal of iconography and symbolism embedded everywhere, which Hamill explains in detail. Some of the rooms are awe-inspiring, others look like set-decoration out of 30s B-movie. In the museum are the regalia and medals worn by Masons through history, including Winston Churchill's Masonic apron."
2,There's a reason Doggie is on the air.....,"There is nothing better than Mad Dog alone in the booth on Saturday morning after a postseason Yankees/BoSox game that goes the wrong way. You can have lotsa laughs just witnessing his opinionated ranting without the baggage of the need for rational argument.And that's where this book goes wrong. Doggie tries to create some objective approach to a totally subjective issue. Who cares, doggie? Let's just have some fun and argue about the rankings on the drive home.BTW, there is no way anyone could leave Wayne Gretzky off the top 10 Movers & Shakers. He basically made the NHL what it came to be in the US before the house of cards came down 2 years ago. If you just go by the number of franchises pre vs. post career, its clear that Gretzky did much more for hockey than even Jordan did for basketball. And that's saying something.See - you want to start arguing this point already don't you? But you can't in print. That's why this book only gets 2 stars."
1,Insult to a courageous lady,"I purchased and read the story of Penelope Stout by Penelope Scambly Schott, and I'm sorry I did. I am a descendant of Penelope Stout, and I believe this poem is an insult to the memory of one courageous woman. I see no need to defame the memory of this beautiful woman by suggesting that she had homosexual leanings and lost her faith. Penelope apparently did not lose her faith in God as she reared children who were people of faith. Marriage and children should be indication enough that she was not a Lesbian. I see no reason for what I consider slander of the woman called the First Lady of Monmouth NJ. My advice to anyone descended from Penelope Stout is to not waste your money. I for one will not keep this book in my home library nor will I recommend it to anyone."
4,A Needed Viewpoint,"Having been a part of the ""fundamental revival of the seventies"" (page 3) and a graduate of a major ""soul winning"" institution, I find this book to be most refreshing. I think that if I could count all the messages that I have heard about living ""for His pleasure"", I could count them on both hands.This book adds the needed balance (er, sorry, Bro. Gipp, I mean ""temperance"") that is missing most of the time in our fundamental churches. I believe that I have heard the phrase ""soul winning is the main thing"" or a variation of that in the church that I now attend. However, in defense of those who say it, it is a ""cliche"" that is just repeated without real ""thought"" put behind it. Dr. Gipp does a wonderful job making that very point. We are to THINK!I can't give five stars because of the typos in this book. I also don't like the ""left justification"" of the text. It makes it harder to read (for me).Thanks, Dr. Gipp, for this needed book."
5,A Must for the Yoga Nidra Practitioner.,Gives you a full understanding of Yoga Nidra which helps you to achieve a deeper medatative stste. This book is a must for anyone interested in Yoga Nidra.
5,Fun for a while...,"This has to be one of the most fun games I have played in college so far. It consists of the clue giver/story teller reading a situation off the given card aloud, i.e ""A man lies dead on the ground. Next to him is a marble. Who killed him, how and why?"" By asking yes or no questions, the other people must figure out the answers to the questions provided. It can be frustrating at first because you are given so little information, but by thinking out of the box players realize that a jealous girlfriend glued a marble to a tightrope, and when the man, a tightroping bicyclist, went across it during the circus, he fell to his death. Some of the answers are way out in left field, but the game always has you going ""Ohhhhh..."" at the end. Extremely entertaining, but once you run out of cards essentially you cannot play the game again."
4,It's a chair and a toy,"I bought the bean bag chair for my nephew's 2nd birthday. The family are big baseball fans and I thought they'd get a kick out of it. It's just the right size for a small child and doesn't take up too much room. The cover comes off for washing which is ideal. When he first saw it he tried to throw it so I don't think he quite got it but now loves it. For the price and the ""fun twist"" on the standard bean bag chair, it's worth it."
3,KOKO THE CLOWN,"This is a film that predates 'Kentucky Fried Movie' and may in fact be one of it's inspirations. If there was only one reason for me to recommend this film (aside from it's general raunch) it would have to be the genius of the KOKO the Clown sketch!!! The guy deserves an Academy Award for 'Funniest Five Minute Portrayal'!!!! Hands down the best part of the film and something to make you think about when you watch the likes of 'Barney' or god forbid the 'Teletubbies'!!!! The rest includes Chevy Chase ...etc...blah...blah... oh, and a singing puppet of a body part that even I could not belive I was seeing!!!!! Kooky stuff!!! We need more like it!!!!"
3,"Not gut-busting,","but not totally junk, by any means. When GT was released, the humor was kind of funny-crude and a few sketches were a little eye-opening. But that was then. Today, a decent amount remains funny, other things you wonder why you ever found funny, and still others weren't even funny when the film came out (the dealers, for example, which you can FF right through without missing a beat). Boittom line: yes, it's worth watching, but don't expect YOung Frankenstein, y'know? Like any comedy sketch film, it's uneven."
4,"Still Funny, Still ""Out There.""","The Groove Tube was a precursor to many trends in adult entertainment, including ""Saturday Night Live."" It's a set of short stories, ""commercials,"" and blackouts, featuring people like Richard Belzer and Chevy Chase. Aimed squarely at a mid-1970s young adult/college crowd, the humor is topical, risque, sometimes illicit.The DVD is a very good transfer-better than the print I saw in the theater. There aren't a lot of special features, but instead there are chapter-by-chapter bookmarks for each skit. The overall quality is excellent. On a fairly large TV, the experience is very ""theater-like.""Overall, I would recommend The Groove Tube to anyone who had enjoyed it when it was released, and anyone younger who saw more comedy than the overt jokes on Saturday Night Live or Second City. This is a good catch."
4,A gem from the North...,"Metropolis is the name for a collaboratve project,teaming singer songwriter extraordinaire Stan Meissner with the vocalist Peter Fredette(both from Canada) for a monster pop-rock album,comprising amazing songwriting,power,and more than a touch of class.It is a shame that this album received so little notice in North America.The initial release of this album was in Germany,showing that the European audiences are much more open to the genre."
1,The screen moving up and down at its own will,"I have returned the screen because of the malfunction. It only comes with the remote control and does not include the wired wall-mount control ($50 + shipping if purchase from elitescreen.com). When I first set it up and connected it with power, without touching any button on the remote control, the screen started moving down for a few seconds, then going back up for a few seconds, then moving down again, and then moving up again, .... It keeps doing that at its own will for no reason and I have no ways of making it to stop. Removed batteries from the remote control did not help. At a point, the screen started to tilt and eventually stuck in the middle of the operation."
2,Screen Trigger,"Screen quality is excellant but the trigger function needs improvement. Using one of the reviews posted on the customer comments I tried using a CAT5/6 cable to connect the screen to my projector (Mistubishi 5000U). The screen motor makes a clicking sound when I power on my projector but does not drop down.Also, I did not get the wall unit switch as mentioned in the product description. Amazon although reduced the cost fractionally to match the current cost of the screen, they still haven't sent me a new switch as communicated by the Amazon representative."
2,charging was a pain,"I loved the camera, absolutely loved it. I was using it one night and it died. I went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened. The light on the charger didn't flash or the camera didn't even go in after dying. The second time I used it, I just got back from vacation and put it on the charger. I was able to turn it on to look at the pictures. As I was looking at the pictures, it just shut off. I was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose. I would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine."
4,Added note,"The reviewer who said something about the lack of plot of this book (or, at least, the plot keeps changing from chapter to chapter) is right. It is not as well-written as some of the other Anastasia books. I still really liked it, though."
5,A delightful series,"Coming from an intellectual, not quite mainstream family, the Anastasia books were some of the only books I read as a child in which I could identify with the protagonist's family. For that reason alone, I'd recommend these books to other children of intellectuals (both my parents are academics).The books are also witty, intelligent, compassionate, and beautifully written--and the characters are incredibly well-crafted. Anastasia is, in her way, every bit as memorable as Beverly Cleary's Ramona. For that reason, I'd recommend these books to anyone."
2,Buy Deep Sea instead,"While the images are beautiful, the content is less interesting and educational than Deep Sea if you are looking for under the ocean footage and information. My almost 5 year old loved Deep Sea and has learned lots about the fish and animals that live in the sea--he has watched that repeatedly. I think The Living Sea just made him want to go surfing!"
5,A Fitting Tribute to the Genius of Duke Ellington,This Set is Incredible.The Band&Duke are Wonderful.it's a Grand Tribute to one of The Greatest Teachers The Music World Has ever Heard.The Music always sounds so Fresh&Alive.that's The Legacy Of Duke.
4,A great help for Java file and field programming,"I have searched for about 18 months for a way to handle files and fields in Java so that I could implement my ideas for advanced data structures. Marty's book is helping me do this.It is obvious that he enjoyed writing this book. I very much like his filppant, conversational style. That's what the subject mater deserves. His style really helps the reader get involved with the subject matter.He has a very good professional programming philosophy and style -- good programming practice is preached and practiced. His programs and applications are heavy weight not just toys. I am having a little trouble getting the programs for the later chapters to work as advertised on my system. Marty has been very helpful via email and I am confident that soond they will perform up to snuff."
5,nice bag,this bag is nice well made and offers some pertecsion for your banjo it is padded and a nice size for a 5 string
4,"A standard, but good bag.","Well made. It does the job. I like the multiple pockets and multiple carrying handles.Detracting 1 star because of no pockets big enough for magazine-sized books or music. You have to store it under your resonator. I don't mind that much, though."
1,Very negative experience,"So far my experience has been very negative with this camera. It started by the software installation wizard hanging at around 76%. I had to kill it and rerun it this time instructing it to only install the driver.Then I operated the camera through Yahoo Messenger. However, the camera regularly freezes. To unfreeze I have to close down the camera window and rerun it.I found a driver update at Creative site. Downloaded it and followed the instructions, but it failed to install the latest version driver which claims to fix the freezing problem.Then I tried the update function that came with the camera software. After the very lengthy process it successfully updated what it considered needed update. But the freezing problem persists.I did a brief search to see if others have seen and dealt with these problems but could not find much."
3,Bad Image Quality,"If you can get this webcam in the $10 range, then it's a good buy, because the poor image quality cannot justify spending anything more on it. It installed without any problem, but Contrast is bad in low light situation, and even with good lighting the picture is very grainy. Compared to the MSFT lifecam 3000, the Creative cam is 10x worse in term of picture quality."
3,"Camera OK, software stinks","Like other reviewers, I got this camera cheap through rebate. This is my first webcam, so I can't compare it with others. The image quality seems sufficient with good lighting, but does appear grainy in low light conditions. The worst part about this camera is the software. The install process was long and painful. It's actually several installs in one and it installs multiple applications I would never use (like a photo management tool). I installed this camera first on an old Win2k computer and found that it barely worked due to the limitations of the computer. I then installed it on a new Vista machine and it didn't work at first. After downloading software updates from the Creative website, it works fine. For $5 it's a good buy. For full price, you will probably be able to find better alternatives."
5,Good oil,A good grade oil to use with stones. My experience has been positive. I highly recommend this product. A good product at a great price.
3,Ending is not satisfying,"Great writing, good plot, a very believable tale. I found it moved along well, but ended far too abruptly to be a satisfying conclusion, which I found surprising."
4,Longines master Moon phase,"I have had the Master Moonphase for some time and have had no trouble, the number of complications is high for the price and the gulloche face is of high quality. Of course it is not top tier watchmaking but you do get value for money, I think it's a great everyday chronograph."
4,Harvey Mason Strong Work!,"This is a decent CD. I bought it for ""Spell"". Harvey Jason's best work I think has been with other artists. But if you are a real Harvey Mason fan. This CD is definitely worth buying!"
1,Was Sent Two Different Size Chicks,"I Ordered two penquin chicks, they arrived today and when I opened the box I was very confused one chich is about 4 inched tall (as stated in the product discription) and the OTHER ONE is about 9 inches tall. Very frustrating when you order two of the same products but you receive two different products. I dont think anyone checks what they put into the boxes. Beware if you wnat more then one they may not be the same product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,purrrfectly pleased,"these cards are exactly what i expected to receive when i ordered them. only wish there was more variety of cat/snow photos, but i know that's not what i ordered. very cute and i got some compliments on them!"
3,Great capacity little flimsy,"Great for transferring large files or backing up important documents, but just doesn't have a sold feel. The need not to have a cover is a must as these are easily lost."
4,Effortless and efficient,"Having earlier tried to learn by textbook, I was surprised to find this so much easier."
4,Another good Palmer book!,"Stubborn male leads, vulnerable yet strong women. I do how the men always get what's coming to them in the end. What more could you ask for."
5,Regan's Pride,thank you for sending this book as i have read it before and did not remember it and enjoyed again
2,An Early Glimpse,"This is a bootleg recording of the original Alice Cooper group performing at the 1969 Toronto Peace Festival. This bootleg is known by many other titles other than FREAK OUT. Only two of the songs on the album ever showed up on a studio album (""Painting A Picture"" as ""No Longer Umpire"" and ""Science Fiction"" as ""Fields of Regret"" on their first album - PRETTIES FOR YOU). And two other songs were not even performed by the group, but by blues artist Ronnie Hawkins (""Goin' To The River"" and ""Ain't That Just Like A Woman""). This is an early glimpse of the group at a time when they were arguably still learning to play their instruments, and people would walk out of their performances. That is, until Frank Zappa ""discovered"" them."
3,Good DVD but not my sons' favorite,"My two sons love songs in the Thomas DVD, so I decided to get one with bunch of songs. We also bought ""Thomas & Friends - Songs From the Station"" together with this one. For some reason, they clearly like ""Thomas & Friends - Songs From the Station "" better than this one. I still think it's a great DVD but you gotta listen what your children tell you."
3,Men's Wallet,Description was not accurate on Web Site. Wallet was nice though. Postage was deducted becaused I returned it.
2,Too small,I felt the product was too small (at least for me). Could hardly fit 2-3 credit cards and a driver's license. No place to keep change. Didn't like much..
1,Horrible after 2 months,"I bought this wallet to replace a Coach wallet given as a gift. The price was right and the reviews looked great. When I first got the wallet I was excited and I liked it immediately. Two months later I'm very unhappy with the wallet for two main reasons.1. The pockets for cards don't hold anything after they've been used for a short amount of time. I definitely don't keep a lot of cards in my wallet, maybe 8 all together. After keeping cards in there for about one month, if I hold the wallet upside down, all the cards will fall out. I can't stress how annoying this is.2. The pockets are starting to come apart at the seams. The wallet is about to fall apart. Nothing more to say about that.Although I wouldn't have spent that much money on the Coach wallet, I realize now that wallet was good to me for more than 4 years. I'll be going to pick up a higher quality wallet now.Don't be fooled by the looks and the great price!"
5,Change the trajectory of your child's life,I have used this book as a kindergarten teacher everyday for the past 4 years. I read one page to the class a day and we act out the comic book strips. The students in my class are always remarkably well-behaved and their parents often thank me for transforming their little monsters into polite little children.
3,This ain't the purple haired Zeros.,"In case anyone is as big a fan as I am of the Zeros from the Sunset Strip days when they painted the Whisky A Gogo purple this is a definitely a different band. How confusing. Get a copy of 4,3,2,1 The Zeros by the purple haired glampunks to hear what us mongers loved about them."
4,Smoking!..a must have,"This is a typical Krosfyah CD....full of life and leaves u craving for more .It is a good production. I particularly like Haunting Melodies, Redemption of me and Facts of life..."
3,a bit dated but very good,"A bit dated, but a truly gripping picture of a surgery residency in Bellevue. It captures much of the frustration and much of the idealism inherent in medicine, and it is a fascinating read. I'm very glad to see it is still in print. I have a tattered paperback that must be over 20 years old, and it's good to know that people are still buying and reading this book."
1,Doesn't work,"Good luck with these wireless controllers. I bought this pair as a gift for a new PS2 gamer, but was dissapointed with it's failure to connect. They do blink very nicely trying to make a connection and I suppose they'd make a nice, if not expensive, holiday ornament. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Caveat emptor. (That's Latin for ""keep your receipt."")"
1,Unpredictable nightmare...,"These things have a mind of their own. Every electronics item in the house seems to interfere - phones, microwave, FISHTANKS?!?!Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't...."
2,"ok, but the next version is better","it gets the job done, but 0.3MP isn't good picture quality. The biggest gripe I have is that there is no time/date stamp."
1,"Unfortunately, I can't give ZERO stars....","Nothing but a rambling, idiotic, paranoid and pointless rant by a complete idiot for other complete idiots. If you want to reinforce your factually inaccurate, reactionary, and downright moronic ideals of an America that never was, this book is definitely for you. If you have MORE than two active brain cells, your time would be better spent emptying your bowels. Of course, there would be less crap doing that, though."
4,Excellent music for all-rounder listeners,"I was surprised that jazz could sound this melodic and musical! I'm a vocal jazz/pop fan. This thing is BAD! It's got OOMPH! If the recording quality is a lil bit better, I'd've rated it 5 stars... but, I'd rate it 4.5 stars. I'm buying Travelling Miles tomorrow."
1,nothing is real,"I have always felt Ms. Wilson to be overrated because I have failed to find any sort of pulse, commitment or effort from her performances.""Come for a swim Cassandra"", ""No, I will get my hair wet"".Give me Billie Holiday. Everything she sings, you believe."
1,New Moon Daughter,I hate it! It was suggested to me as a match for my taste in music because I like Jane Monheit. This is light years behind. If you like women vocalists and musicians who sound like heroin addicts you will love this. A classic for durge music.
2,"Deep,earthy, boredom.","I borrowed this CD on advice from a review on the web. I am just getting into this style of music, being initiated by Patricia Barber's ""Modern Cool"". I love that alblum. So I tried this one. Ms. Wilson has an earthy, gritty voice with appeal. But I only found one or two songs that I really wanted to listen to more than once. I am glad I did not buy this one. Sound is tolerable, but overall, not my cup of tea."
2,Shameful execution!!!,"First off Robert Blitzer is a smart man but this book is poorly written.When going through some practice exercises i found that the difficulty kicked in right away, giving me no time to get used to the concept of the problem i was faced with. To add insult to injury some problems were hard to solve since they left blank on how to accomplish solving the task....I also felt his tendency to use excessive amount of word problems led me to belive this was wriiten for a master level college class."
1,when actors aren't very good...,"Coscarelli's first Phantasm flick was a winner, no doubt about it, quite an accomplishment, but this flick here, this episode of Masters... simply does not work.First of all, the actors aren't very good (with the exception of the guy with the chrome teeth--borrowed from that Bond flick, no doubt) and we don't really care what happens to the chick or her a-hole boyfriend. So who is there left to root for?The art direction seems to out-shine the series... That's pretty sad, though, isn't it, when all you can recommend is the art direction?RE: Extras. Nifty. Admire the way Coscarelli created his own start in films; well, his dad raising the bucks for the initial effort didn't hurt him any, either.Bubba Ho-Tep looks like fun. I might check it out."
4,I recommend it,"If you're a fan of horror and if you didn't catch these on Showtime then I would recommend this box set. The first season is real good, overall. (If the price is a problem you can also rent each individual movie from Netflix or Blockbusters.)"
5,I love it!,It came just like what I expected. It works well. Much cheaper comparing to the one at office depo that I wanted to buy before.
2,Overrated and Dull,"Fulci could never seem to find a decent script to waste his directorial talents on, and he fails here as well. After a priest's suicide, the gates of hell open...huh? I am also sick of intrepid reporters trying to save everyone, the plot wreaks. As for the head drilling scene, it was obviously thrown in to gross you out, not for the scares. I give this two stars only for the coffin rescue scene, too bad the film could not live up to that."
1,"I NEVER DID GET THE GIST OF THIS MOVIE,","THE GATES OF HELL WERE OPENED AND THESE DEMONS, AND SPIRITS COME OUT AND TERROZIE A TOWN, THE TWO KIDS CLOSE THE GATE TO HELL AND THAT'S THE END OF THE STORY. HUH?"
3,Ok but not Directed by Fulci,"This film is interesting but according to the credits it was not directed by Fulci, does not star Christopher George and was not made in 1983. Other than those minor discrepancies Amazon is right on. Worth a look but not if you are expecting another film by the late Fulci."
1,Very overrated. See Dead Alive instead.,"So far, Ive seen these films by Lucio Fulci: The Beyond, Zombie, House by the Cemetery, and I just saw City of the Living Dead. With all the hype and talk of these films that Ive read and heard, Ive been VERY disappointed. I think they were really boring and hardly watchable. And yes, there is gore, but I didnt find it worth it to skip half the movie to watch it. I would recommend Dead Alive(unrated) and Return of the Living Dead. I was much more entertained with these."
2,Gates of Hell 2 is not what you would exspect!,"This is sasposed to be a sequal to Gates Of Hell. Unfournitly, it fails on every try. Teens wake up some demon, and it chases them around in the dark so you cant see anything. Its dedicated to the great Lucio Fulci, dispite the fact that this movie had nothing at all to do with his first Gates Of Hell. The movie gets some creidit for trying."
5,Fulci Lives,"Quick saying....this is opne of the best fulci movies ever,the gore is great and horror stay's grounded. Buy this dvd! now!"
1,the worst film ever!,"this movie is in direct competition with ""plan 9 from outer space"" as the most atrocious movie ever...there isnt much storyline and the repetitive ""music score""(one beat from a piano, one beat of a drum) gave me a headache..never mind that the priest hung himself....i would've hung myself too"
1,Should have been able to give negative stars !!,"How anyone who considers themselves fans of the horror genre & zombie films in particular can rate this trash above 1 star is inconceivable. I'm glad I received a phone call in the middle of the movie. It woke me up !! Please save your hard earned money & stay away from this absolute waste of time. If you want horror & zombie films at their best, stick with the true master of the genre, George Romero."
2,Déjà vu in the Nightside,"I feel somewhat surprised to be giving this novel only 2 stars. However, this would have to be the most disappointing book in this series to date. John indulges in some time travel to find out the secrets of the Nightside's beginnings and how he can prevent future catastrophe taking place.This book neatly wraps up a lot of loose ends in the series to this point - however, its also very much like reading similar plots in the author's Deathstalker series, and doesn't add a lot of forward momentum to the series overall. This book is more of a place-marker in the series rather than the resolution of an interesting mystery and not one I would bother reading again."
5,Amazing,Once again Simon r Green tells a stunning tail from the nightside and we get to see the powers of other major players in this book
2,Not at all impresed,"The batteries on the SKIL Xdrive series are a pain in the rearend to get off! I am a woman and I use powertools often in the house, the drill most often but I use the saw as well and I have to wait for my husband to get home from work to get the battery off. And he has problems with it too.I want a powertool that is easy to use and that includes changing the battery. I do like the overall feel of the drill as well as the light that is on teh drill that helps when working in darker places."
3,"great drill, weak battery","I've had this drill for a couple of years now and use it about once a month on small woodworking projects. I really like the way the drill performs for the most part, but the battery life is bad. I have two batteries, which is good because they don't last long. This weekend I changed batteries after about every 5th or 6th hole I drilled. Nothing fancy, 3/4 inch deep holes in the end grain of some spruce. A new battery lists here for $50, so I think I'm headed back to a corded drill. I don't like spending more time charging my tools than using them."
4,Michael Reagan - The GOOD son.,Buy it. Read it. Enjoy. Be sure to donate the book when you are done to any local senior center.
1,Won't Last,"It couldn't be more fun for a young boy... as long as it lasts.Great idea, but not designed for use, especially by a young child. Don't bother gambling, the only question is if it will last you a day or a month."
4,Cute race track.,"This toy is cute and has been fun for my 1 year old grandson. The music has a little country sound to it. It doesn't do a whole lot but go around the crazy 8, but for a 1 year old that's probably perfect. Easy for him to hit the button to make it go."
1,Here's BORING,"this is the first ever of carson on tv, and it shows. the programs are ultra boring. everything is soo predictable, the jokes are old, much is juvenile, more even is dumbed down humor, but then i guess you have to figure the times, back then, this might have gone over somewhat. but seeing it today, well it is not the carson of late night tv."
4,Helpful book for those who need to know!,"I like the way that the book organizes the recipies! It gives the calories and when is a good time for the recipe. The hospital gives you some recipie guidelines, but nothing specific. THis book is very helpful for people that are board with soups from a can..."
5,Great WLS recipes!,"This is a wonderful book. The recipes are very easy, with products you probably have on hand. All the recipes show the nutritional values and the serving guidelines for your particular surgery."
3,I haven't used it!,"I skimmed over the cookbook when I first received it, but nothing really popped out at me. The ingredients are a little gourmet for me on an everyday basis. The book hasn't been used and I feel it was a waste of my money, but perhaps not for someone else."
1,Yuck,"I have tried many of the recipies from this book and for the most part they are just bad. My roommate has eaten some of them simply becuase, but I'm the one who had RNY gastric bypass and I couldn't stand them. The strogonaff is the only tolerable one so far."
