4,An easy sentimental read!,"Some of the reviews might say the book lacks ""spark"", but I found the book to be sentimental. Anyone out there who has been touched by the death of a loved one, can relate. Nights in Rondanthe, engulfs a world of strength, magnified and tied together by a mom and her daughter. This is a great book if you are sentimental at all. I think it could have been a bit longer. I personally have loved all of the Sparks novels, and will continue to read and look forward to the new ones. I'm sending this one to my mom."
5,Great As Always,"Though many have given less than perfect reviews, I personally loved the book. I have read every book Nicholas Sparks has written and have never been disappointed. Its is good to know he can write with such a vast difference in characters from book to book. I think this is a must read."
5,I loved this book,I see alot of people were disappointed. I thought this book was wounderful. I could really feel the characters. It kept my attention all the way through. I can't wait to see the movie.
4,Still not as good as The Notebook,"I absolutely loved The Notebook. And I've read everything else that Nicholas Sparks has written as soon as it comes out. When I heard that Nights of Rodanthe was on the way, I pre-ordered it here at Amazon. I received the book on the day I was heading out of town. On the plane, I read the entire thing. Total flight time...less than 3 hours...and I was done.Sparks has an amazing way with words. It's almost indescribable how he captures the emotions of his characters. I want to love and be loved the way his characters do.Nights in Rodanthe was good...but The Notebook is still #1 for me."
2,Haven't I Read This Somewhere Before?,"As a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, I pre-ordered this book so I could read it immediately following its release. I was very disappointed! Not only was it lacking in passion and surprise, but it is nearly the same story I read in ""Message in a Bottle"". If you're thinking of reading a Nicholas Sparks book, I would definitely recommend skipping this one. ""A Bend in the Road"" and ""The Rescue"" are far better books, with deeper plots and well-rounded characters. ""Nights in Rodanthe"" is very one-dimensional and predictable. It was a big disappointment for this fan."
3,Form Writer,"Don't get me wrong, I love to curl up with a Nicholas Sparks book and let him take me away.I have read all of his book, fell in love with ""Message in a Bottle""...But I feel like all he does is take his outline that he has used for every book and change the character and the scene. It is getting a bit repetitive."
1,Look elsewhere,"Not typically the type of book I read, but was surprised by the elementary grade school level happenings and the unemotional feeling I was left with...."
1,Skip this one!,"I like romances; I like Richard Gere. I kept reading hoping that the best was coming. Nothing of interest in the characters in the book or the actors in the movie (I rented the dvd afterwards to see if I was mistaken). I didn't read or see any chemistry, passion or sparks. The author didn't draw me in, it wasn't a page-turner, but I kept at it because someone made a movie from it so the book must be good. I didn't pick up on anything to recommend the book or the movie. The book did not paint any pictures or plant any emotions for me. Usually after reading a good book, especially a good romance novel, the author has painted such good scenes that it feels like you have already seen the movie. I saw nothing in the book or the movie. When I got to the end of the book, there was nothing."
1,This Novel is a Dud!,"As a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, I eagerly awaited the release of his latest novel. Upon finishing the little 212 page novel, I was extremely disappointed. Usually, I think Sparks can do no wrong, but I was wrong. This novel does not live up to the expectations readers have after reading The Notebook or A Walk to Remember. To say the least, don't waste your time with this poorly written book. Sparks lacks to go into as much detail as he usually does. At the end of the book, you feel like you don't know any of the characters."
2,"Boring, flat, predictable","I had not read a Sparks book before -- I can only say I hope his other efforts are better than this lackluster snoozefest. There was absolutely nothing interesting in the plot and the characters were flat and boring. Neither of the two ""leads"" seemed particularly special to me, and the story was so excruciatingly predictable that I found myself almost laughing at it. And, the ""message"" that this woman ""learns to love"" again, then shuts herself off forever is hardly healthy or positive. These two people are thrown together, exchange a few stories and platitudes, and wham, they are deeply and truly in love. Gag.""The Notebook"" was a good movie, so maybe that book is better."
2,too short of a story,the story was too short and in a way too predictable. the choice was much better than this book. I'll pass on the movie when it comes out in the fall.
3,I Thought I Was the Only One!,"I've had the same thought as others about Nicholas' last few books, but I was afraid to speak up and say anything because I thought I was the only one who felt that way! Nights in Rodanthe was okay, but like the last couple books it seemed like a repeat of predictable characters and circumstances. For the reviewer looking for fresh voices, I have many but I'll stick to two. If you want someone like Nicholas Sparks who expresses emotion and writes stories with great meaning, then I would follow other reviewers advice and pick up Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin - it is the most beautiful novel I have read since The Notebook. I even cried reading an excerpt of his next book at thegraveldrive.com. When I want something warm and funny, I pick up Fannie Flagg - Standing in the Rainbow is excellent! I hope Nicholas returns to his former brilliance with the next one."
5,Keeps Readers on the Edges of Their Seats,"Nights in Rodanthe was a sweet, interesting love story. It was well written and kept me glued to the pages the whole time. It is one of my favorite books now. Usually, Nicholas Spark's books are pretty easy to read and not very interesting, but this was probably his best book yet!"
3,not a complete waste of time,"Audio - read by JoBeth Williams. She has a wonderful reading voice - so relaxing and pleasant. Nicolas Sparks has a beautiful way with words. The story, however, was not as uplifting as several other Sparks' efforts. A woman shares her own story of love lost with her widowed daughter."
2,Just Okay,"I loved The Notebook and Message In A Bottle and A Walk to Remember. Most of the time I disregard what the reviewers say. And so I rushed to get Nights in Rodanthe. But I am afraid they got it right this time. I should have listened:""Of course, the beach, an impending storm, the fact that there are no other visitors around, a roaring fireplace, and any number of moments that could have been culled from a J. Crew catalogue and a Folgers's commercial make romance just about inevitable. Sparks couldn't be less subtle in this harshly mechanical story that adheres to formula in a way that would make an assembly-line romance writer blush. Short, to the point, and absolutely unremarkable."" I hope Nicholas can recapture the magic of his first novels."
5,"Sweet, Interesting and Captivating love story","Nights in Rodanthe was a sweet, interesting and captivating love story. It was well written and kept me glued the whole time. Usually, Nicholas Spark's books are pretty easy commercial read, however this was probably his best book after a walk to remember!"
3,VERY WELL MARKED BOX!!,"If you plan to buy this you should know that it is shipped in the original case from the factory!! The case says KOTEX Maxi on EVERY SIDE!!!!!! How horrifying to get home from work and see this sitting outside my front door! Thank God I have a little entryway where it was partially hidden! I'm sure the UPS man, and my neighbors, got quite a laugh. I also paid $36 for it in Jan. '09, they have really jacked the price up as of May '09 it was $80...are you kidding me?!?!I bought this on amazon because it was a good price, and easier than buying one pack at a time at the store. I wouldn't have bothered if I had known how it would arrive. UGH!! If this doesn't bother you then go for it, the pads themselves are fine."
4,"""Good Ghost Comedy!""","Peter O'Toole, Steve Guttenberg and Daryl Hannah starin this 1988 comedy. A group of people stay at an Irishcastle expecting it to be haunted and discover it reallyis. I've always enjoyed this film and this dvd has goodpicture and sound, but only the trailer. I recommendthis good ghost comedy."
3,This wasn't a scary movie but it was funny in a macabre way,"plenty of laughs, not a strong story line but enough to keep you following along. It wasn't scary but is really funny in a a gothic sort of way"
3,This is a really cool movie.,When I wa slittle this was my favorite movie. I still love it today. It is very creative and funny. This is my favorite vampire movie next to the lostboys.
4,Conveys Fundamentals Well,This book did a great job of explaining the basics in fairly simple terms. It even gave some simple math to figure out how components will work under specific situations. This is a great starting point for learning about chassis and suspension.
2,There are much better options,"Despite the title, it's mainly focused on suspension design and tuning. It has some useful stuff, but nothing you can't find in many other books, and there are some basic errors on it.I purchased it together with ""Race Car Engineering & Mechanics"", and I'd strongly recommend this one instead. Better written, similarly priced, and a far, far bigger density of useful information in it."
1,Megala-who?,This movie (...)!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Their was no violence and yet it was rated R! Jaws had much more violence and was PG! This is without doubt a Jaws WANNABEE
1,I was cheering for the shark...,"This has the typical underwater movie plot. Animal of immense proportions lives relatively undiscovered in the sea. Only one person believes. Chaos ensues. I rented this one along with Dean Cain's 'Dark Descent'. First imagine my shock to find out that they are made by the same people. Not the same company, the exact same people. But that was all they had in common. This movie actually had great graphics as far as the megalodon shark was concerned. It was for the most part believable. The problem was that the story wasn't about the shark. It was about Spencer Northcutt (Antonio Sabato, Jr.) and the vendetta that had ruled his life. Basically, it was like a bad soap. I love creature features, and I love horror, but I don't like drama that pretends to be something it's not. This movie gets one star because of Grand L. Bush's t-shirt. (Well, and there was no lower option.) I would only advise renting this if you're a big fan of one of the actors."
3,worse than the first one,sream 2 works but it's not good as the precessor.. why? ok..let's start saying that the plot isn't so original and there are moments that make u smile! it's not amzing and the original was stronger. i didn't get so terrified watching the second ones cos there are scenes similar to the first... so:this isn't bad at all.u'll find it good only 'cos it's scream...! wes craven could do much much better... boring! i hope the third will be better but i'm not so sure........
2,Not very good...,"Being a scream movie, it has to get some credit, but the end of this movie sucked. It was the one of the worst endings to a movie that I have ever seen. Scream 3 is in the making (I think) and I hope that they didn't follow the tracks of this movie. AVOID."
4,Don't let the ending ruin the movie,"I loved the first Scream movie and the second one, in many ways, is even better. Because it has the first one to work off of, it can be even more witty and have more in-jokes. The ending does suck, however, and the killer is a disappointment, but I really don't think that should stop someone from watching what was really as good a movie as the original, maybe better. Best sequence: Sidney's play rehearsal"
1,IT SUCKED,"""SCREAM"" WAS ORIGINAL,SLICK,AND STYLISH. AND ,SADLY,""SCREAM 2"" IS WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED OF A FILM TRYING TO CASH IN ON THE ORIGINAL'S SUCESS, PITIFUL.""SCREAM 2"" IS PRETTY MUCH A REMAKE OF THE FIRST,EXCEPT YOU BRING A FEW NEW VICTIMS ,A NEW SETTING ,AND A POOR SCRIPT.AND,SADLY, THE SAME AUDIENCE THAT ATTENDED ""SCREAM"",RETURNED TO SEE THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR A HORROR FILM,THUS INEVITABLY,BRINGING ON A THIRD ""SCREAM"".I WOULD DISOWN THIS CRAP IF I MADE IT.BUT,TAKE YOUR CHANCE,I DID ,AND I GOT BURNED."
2,Hey Mr. Ghost face! Kill this movie!!!!!!!!!!,"This sequel did not meet my requirements for a good one. It lacks good acting and suspense. I knew after the third killing scene who one of the killers was. It was obvious. I was bored at watching this movie. Scream 1 was A 5 star, this was just crap. Sorry wes, but you can do better then that. They were in too much of a rush to get a big load of money after scream 1. Scream 3 was the best trilogy ender in history, in my opinion. I would only buy this one to have the whole collection. There was really no plot at all. Like I said only, if you want the whole collection, should you buy this movie. Other wise, don't waste your time or money on this disapointment."
5,Scream 2 is the best movie!,Scream 2 has an all-star cast. The movie is scary yet funny. You gotta see it! END
3,"Decent, although not quite its predecessor","I'll agree that Scream 1 was better. Although I thought Neve Campbell looked better in this one (I liked the way she had her hair). And why, oh why, does poor Sarah Michelle Gellar have to die in every damn movie she's in!?! Leave her alone for once (we're with you Sarah!). I did like the idea of portraying a movie with what happened in Scream (I'm talking about ""Stab""). Scream 2 was OK; I've seen worse sequels than this."
5,Neve Campbell Crushed It!,"While the first Scream was better, Neve looked great in this one! The movie was good also. I liked how the used all the original cast that was left over from the first one. Neve Crushed It!"
2,AN UNBEARABLE ENDING !,The ending to a horror movie can make or break it & just like 'I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER''URBAN LEGENDS' & many more flops since Wes Craven's original & excellent slasher parody 'SCREAM' Craven's follow up 'SCREAM 2' is ridiculously broken by its ultra lame ending. It was a decent slasher flick most of the way through & then destroid by its ending! I truly believe that this is one of the movies that marks the beginning of Wes Craven falling off the great horror director wagon! I mean come on look at his most recent flops 'RED EYE' & the absolute intolerable 'CURSED'. What happend Wes!
4,A Sequel Thats Almost an Equal,"Wes Craven directed this vividly energetic and incredibly tense sequel to Scream thats actually as witty,thrilling, and humorous as the orginal. Though lacking in any new creativity or innovation, Scream 2 is still an excellent slasher film that continues Scream's homage and paroding of horror movie cliches and patterns. Beginning with a clever opening sequence thats about as provocative as Drew Barrymore's death in 1, Scream 2 settles down and composes a jazzy, uneasy, and edgy story that builds upon audience awareness of Scream's story to create a more fullfilling storytelling style than Scream Though weakened by an overly dramatic and inferior conclusion, Scream 2 is still a much better sequal than I could have possiably hoped for. Moresatrical in style and bold in humor, Scream 2 attacks horror more boldy and gets away with murder.The DVD really doesn't have that many extras but if you're Scream 2 fan, you really can't go wrong with this."
4,Scream 2,"Scream 2The sequal to the critically and publicly appraised horror slasher, this is more of the same, although slightly better in that it has a wider scope than the original. Like the original, this is not really scary, as the obvious mortality of the killer(s) makes it more of a murder mystery than a horror. The Scream films tread a fine line by both satirising and conforming to horror movie cliches at the same time, but Scream 2 gets away with it the majority of the time, although certain stupidities still irritate (why not close the campus?). There is also a slight sense of tastelessness about this: the characters' deaths are remarked upon and reacted to, but no remorse seems to been shown. However, it can be argued that this is part of the ironic style of the film, which along with the solid acting and pacey script, conspire to make this a good, enjoyable film.7 out of 10."
3,An okay read,I thought that this book was an okay read. The main characters were good and their dialogue entertaining. But I found the plot left alot to be desired especially the secret Ian is hiding. It could have used a little spicing up. A bit too fairy tale for my tastes. But still a decent enough read.
4,Have to love her Heroes,"If you like to fall in love with your heroes laugh aloud when you read a romance and not be kept up all night reading this book is for you.Sabrina Jeffries has found a perfect match for the notorious Ian Lennard with gossip columnist Felicity Taylor. They are well matched in temperament, intelligence and in their loyalty to their families. It was an interesting. There is enough conflict to make the story line interesting and not so much that your left wondering why they ever got together. This book is a great Sunday afternoon read."
3,ok,"After reading the reviews here I was excited to read this book. IT wasn't as it was claimed. Perhaps that is why I was somewhat disappointed... I expected it to be overly wonderful like the reviewers said. However, It was an ok read. It only needed more humor and character development. It wasn't boring either cuz i finished it... It's just that in the end, the story wasn't really gripping for you to think about it."
5,Gospel For the New Millenium,"Beautiful... simply awe-inspiring work... a good combination of some pop as well as completely orchestral works, some a combination of both. I recommend this to anyone who has seen the show, understands the deepness of it, as well as those lucky enough to see the movies. For those who remain uninformed, the movies are not the true ending in the eyes of the creator, watch the final actual episodes and bask in the greatness a truly superb psychological series that questions religion and God's relationship with man in this new millenium, after all the true translation from the Japanese title is ""Gospel For the New Millenium"""
4,Rivals Treasure . .,"Takes the best parts of Four Calender Cafe and gives the extra punch of Treasure . . the most complete cd and close to a Swan Song . . nothing out of the ordinary for the band . .rather perfecting what they have done for so long . .with a real drums, too! (As opposed to a drum machine.) Violin and Seekers appeared on the 1995 EP Otherness. And Faye Wong appears on the cd singing in Chinese with Liz backing. The cd is worht it for the track ""Seekers Who Are Lovers"" alone. Rivals anything the Cure ever did during the Faith era. And so much more positive!"
1,Arm broke within minutes,"I bought this doll for my 7-year old daughter and within in minutes the arm broke off. She was very sad. I threw it away after a week because the leg broke off as well. Come on Breyer, when I pay this much for a doll, I expect it to last more than a week. Very disappointed!!!"
2,This Product Is Awkward to Use,"I purchased this product for my 80 year old grandmother with back pain. She couldn't put this on alone, an nearly fell over stepping into the band. I kept the belt for myself post partum, but this product is awkward to use since the white stretchable strap, under the velcro belt, is one solid piece. You have to either step into the circle and pull up, or put it on over your arms (like a tshirt). Unfortunately when contending with back issues, or hip, or anything else the product advertised to help, I can't imagine bending and streching to put it on for the necessary support. Otherwise the velcro design is nice. Two stars because the stretchy band material does procide support and the velcro design with a tightening option on the left and right side works well."
5,Date and Time,"When this came out, it was way ahead of it's time. No other DJ has done this since, especially on this scale. In a world that flips almost once a year you cannot critique track selection. If you missed it, you missed it...it was progressive at the time. The second ""concert"" was no where near as good. This had the ""around the world"" theme and mixed in ""world"" music interestingly. I bought this in '04 and was blown away. If you have never seen it, I think it is probobly still worth watching despite the fact some of the tracks might be worn out by now."
3,More like a circus,"Having listened to all of Tiesto's mix albums over and over (and over!) and seen Tiesto many times, I was excited when I saw this on the shelves, and bought it right away.What's great about Tiesto mixes in general is that he goes from song to song and you don't even know he's doing it, and he keeps lifting your spirits higher and higher. By the time you get through an album you fill like a million bucks.But not this. I think he tried too hard at this concert -- he brought in a bunch of performers and dancers and (it felt like it anyway...) clowns. He basically tried to pull off too much, and frankly it felt more like a circus than a DJ show. The music was similar. Too many styles, even when spread over three hours.When I want to listen to Tiesto live mixes, I'm back to listening to Magik mixes. This DVD is gathering dust. I may even give it away."
4,Great music and effects,"I enjoyed this DVD a lot, it makes you feel like you are really there. I loved the music, and I liked DJ Tiesto's personality. The special light and fire effects are very impressive, and the ""journey across 5 continents"" idea for this concert worked perfectly, I love the world music component of this show and the way Tiesto interacted with the bands was so fun to watch! Things I didn't like: the opening for the dvd was super slow. It was designed as a big buildup, but I don't think it worked. And I also thought Micha Klein's video art was too simplistic, too much like a cartoon, it did not match the mood created by the music and seemed to try to make a statement of its own rather than support Dj Tiesto's work."
3,Good concert,"If you like Tiesto and electronic music in general you got to have this DVD. That event was great, the music, artists invited (Andain, Jan Johnston, dancers, etc) no doubt about that...BUT the DVD production (sound, video, features, etc) and overall presentation is not that good, maybe poor will be the right definition but you'll probably won't notice that if you use it for the proper purpose... PARTY!"
5,Just Great.... Tiesto in Concert!!,"I couldnt wait for the DVD to come to my house to see it.. so i rent i out... at the start... it beguins with Black hole records... then masive explotions, then, the Doctor him self... Tiesto appers in the big screen... great shots, great VJ... just perfect...2 camera angles. more than 2 hours of great musik!I had the chance of meeting him this year in Caracas,Venezuela on the 27th of November... talking with him, was great, then i went to the concert FREE VIP!! even better, only the bad part!!TIESTO, FORGOT TO GIVE ME BACK MY PEN SINCE HE WAS SIGNIGN OUTOGRAPH WITH IT.. NO HASLE...CHILL MON!"
3,Who doesn't love Chester Raccoon?,"A follow up to The Kissing Hand, Audrey Penn's A Pocket Full of Kisses has Chester Raccoon working through feelings of jealousy when he becomes a big brother. My two-year-old demographic of one, Magda, didn't like this one quite as much as The Kissing Hand, but that may be because she has her own opinions about whether or not she'd like to be a big sister!For more, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.Disclaimer: I received a digital galley of this book free from the publisher from NetGalley. I was not obliged to write a favourable review, or even any review at all. The opinions expressed are strictly my own."
5,Good to have extra pieces,I purchased these to have extra pieces and was glad I did....they are a good price...and a great product......recommend these as a shower gift for any mom who plans on pumping
4,Inspirational and cautionary tale,I couldn't put this book down! It is frightening how real the events in this book are...or at least how it could very possibly be in the future. It makes you realize that without understanding each other we create fear and fear creates violence. I think everyone should read this book. The writing is as beautiful as its message of understanding. No one wants another 911.
4,A book on peace,"This book sends a real message at a time when our country and world are in crisis. It reinforces and readdresses a very old message to all human beings. Although it is in fictional format, I think all of us should consider its content as something we need to apply in our lives through our actions. And hopefully our actions will speak louder than words, resulting in more peace throughout our lands."
3,It's a good introduction to drawing Celtic art.,"I think that he did a very credible job, and his book was one of the first available on the subject. His methods are, as stated in another review, ""draw all of the lines and erase the parts you don't want"". His methods are also difficult to scale up or down, in order to fit your work space. For improvements on his methods, I recommend his son's, Iain Bain's, books."
5,Amazing is the best description,"I heard quite a few of the songs before the cd came out via singles and digi-packs which only made me want the cd even more and kept it constantly on my mind. When I finally got the full cd, it blew me away! Every song is written, recorded and presented beautifully. Lyrics stay true to OMS and the music is equally as heavy as one would expect from them. This is their best yet! Definately worth buying, nay... this is definately a must-have cd. Do yourself a favor and obtain this album. You WILL NOT be disapointed."
2,"Great classic in English, but not good in Spanish.","I bought this book because I thought I had found another perfect book for my bilingual son. The English portion is the classic we all love. However, the Spanish section is just a literal translation with absolutely no rhyme or flow to it. I was very disappointed by the translation.La parte en español no vale la pena ya que no tiene rima ni fluye como el original en inglés. Si hubiera sabido esto no hubiera comprado la versión bilingüe. Seguiré buscando otras versiones de este cuento que tanto le gusta a mi hijo. Espero encontrar una buena versión en español."
2,Too Ridiculous To Describe,"Must be seen to be believed.A ridiculously bad filmthat is strangely compelling.You really will want to see thewhole thing although you won'tknow why.Favorite lines:""You're much more attractivewhen you're not talking""""Can a girl buy a guy a drinkin this galaxy""See the on-board spaceshipdisco with pretty young womenin sci-fi style aerobics outfitsdancing with hoola-hoops.How about that group of sexy spacewitches dancing about castingtheir spell upon the goings-on.Marvel at the many and repetitivelaser gun battlesand mini armored bumper-car chasesthrough the labyrinthineabandoned factoryish place.Gasp at the dogfightsagainst space piratesNot to worry,Mr. Clean-cut MuscleboundHero Guy will save thePeace-loving Lost-in-spacePeople from the MutinousMilitary Fascist Peopleand get the girl.Or will he.Not sure what the witchesare actually up to,the film never really endsand the sequel was not made.A suitable ending to a nuttymovie."
5,Brought my shetl ancestry to life Power of brains & mazel!,Mazel validates being different can make for a very exciting life! It validates my strong connection to being a Jew(ish woman) even though I am not committed religiously. It is a celebration of spirit and risk. I loved it even more the second time.
1,Not actual Dermalogica,I ordered 4 different products from the bare mineral line on amazon. I had previously gotten facials done at a spa that used the dermalogica line and loved the way the products really helped out the dryness/redness of my cheeks. I received the products and right away noticed that they didnt even smell the same as the stuff in the salon. I tried it anyways.. used all 4 for over a month and saw absolutely no improvement what so ever. I guess that's what I get for buying them at a discount.
1,Kiosk Rating <1,"What have we done to the people of the Netherlands such they want to emulate the worst of American film. Stay true to yourselves! Don't regress to our cheaply done CGI effects, e.g. Saint Nick riding a horse amongst roof tops and his poorly constructed sailing vessel and the usual, transitory can't quite see glimpses of Nick's bad helper sailors while they snatch people. The cheap props of fake blood in little rivulets down the face and a few stabbings is so boringly overused that no one even reacts anymore. Nick needs to not be a slave to full moons on Dec. 5 and get a life! What's he doing with all those bodies, anyway? Nick also needs a better PR company; after all he's been around for a thousand or more years through out Europe surely he must have some positives. And, why are the police so dumb during the action but seem so clever in deceiving the public for hundreds of years as to Nick's true modus operandi."
4,A Redemptive & Not Condeming Jesus,"Now and then a book comes along that simply reminds us the basic teaching of Jesus, this is that book. Chalke challenges his readers to omit their distorted interpretation and purely focus on the bottom-line of Christ's message, ""God is love."" The author guides us to remove erroneous teachings, spoon-feed by modern day church, by seeing Jesus's life in it original context. The insights he illustrates are lucid and uncomplicated to follow.There are certain debatable points, but those are welcome if we are to mature."
5,A trow back to the good old days,I just love looking at the illustrations almost more than my kids and almost more than the text. I love the way home life is depicted and my kids love the way everyday life is represented through a child's eyes.
3,The Pidgeon Loves Thiongs that Go,My nephew loves the Pidgeon books but this one was a bit of diappointment in that it is very short and doesn't really introduce the characters well.
5,Great PRICE!!!!,I found this bottle in Macy's and other dept stores and it was more than 2 times more... I was very impressed to get the bigger bottle for my husband and only spend 26 dollars total :)
3,Guess Perfume,"Even though I do like it ,it's so light(maybe less than 2 hours and u cannot recognize the smell any more)."
1,Not new,"Length:: 0:51 MinsThese binoculars were advertised as new. The box was damaged, previously opened, and resealed using circular tape tabs. The internal packaging was damaged and items were laying loose inside of the box. I was very disappointed with my purchase because it was a gift for my 11 year old son.The view finder for the digital camera doesnot stay upright. There is no way of knowing what the condition of this item is (new or used). Very disappointed with my purchase experience."
3,Good book but sample material not good enough,"I really enjoyed reading this book and it helped me a lot in my job search. The only thing I was disappointed with was the quality of the many sample CVs, Teaching and Research Statements. You simply need to do significantly better to get a good job."
5,Essential for academic job seekers,This book was very helpful. I recommend anyone looking for an academic position at a four-year college or university buy or borrow it. The examples alone are worth the price of the book.
3,Help for job seekers,I think this is a great product for those specifically after an academic career and is definitely worth a readI found reading around to be a great way to get back into work after a long absence and I came across a great website on my search: http://www.PlanningCrossing.comThis was the best site to look for available jobs; there was a much bigger number than on any other job board I found and they were specifically from employer websitesI got a fair few interviews using this site until finally finding my current (and brilliant) workAnyone interested enough to read this book could definitely benefit from this websiteGood luck!
1,Found myself wishing the heroine would die so the book would end,"I finished the book because that's what I do. It was awful in so many ways. Overly convoluted, trite, improbable, you name it."
1,"Oh god, painful","i am so sorry to the author to be saying this, but the book was soooooooo hard to read! I had to MAKE myself finish it. and the first few pages had a lot of promis. It was sooooooo dull. Again, i am sorry, but i couldn't make myself like it"
1,Strong premise - but an unreadable book,"I picked up this book because the opening premise sounded like a winner--a woman wakes up in a swanky hotel room, all evidence pointing to a romantic wedding night, but she can't remember a thing. A great start, but Ms. Forster bungles this from the get-go with implausible plot twist on top of sorry cliche on top of irritating coincidence.As other reviewers have noted, the romance is next to nonexistent--just about the steamiest scene is between the heroine and herself--and so the book relies on ""Outbreak""-style suspense for it's energy. Unfortunately, the plot has holes the size of a Buick, and the ending was pure, unbelievable hokum; a man completely manipulates a woman's life--creating jobs, friends, isolating her in a remote location and messing with her mind, and making her pregnant--and in the end she forgives him everything. Sheesh! A very disappointing read from a fairly good writer."
1,Terrible!,"This was the most inane, assinine, convuluted book I ever had the misfortune to read. This was so bad I couldn't believe the author really wrote it. Don't waste your money on this book"
1,Just boring,"Quiet Days in Clichy (Claude Chabrol, 1990, 120')American Henry Miller enjoyed a wide variety of sexual escapades while also working hard to establish himself as a serious writer in the Paris of the inter-war years (1919-1939).Jours tranquilles à Clichy is a 1990 film directed by Claude Chabrol. It is based on the autobiographical novel by Henry Miller. The multiple producers already promise trouble: AZ Film Production, Cinecittà, Italfrance Films, Direkt-Film, Istituto Luce, Cofimage 2.The novel was previously adapted into a 1970 Danish film, criticised as pornographic. Whatever it may mean these days (anything from showing nipples to sodomy for the masses), Chabrol's film is not pornographic. A lot of decorative nudity, like the 1980 Caligula, mixed with some acceptable acting.Only highlight is to see Stéphane Audran again, Chabrol's former wife.117us - Quiet Days in Clichy (Claude Chabrol, 1990, 120')'' - 28/7/2012"
1,Handle to easy to break off,"We had this item put in our home when we built the house. The plastic lever for turning on the water is just too flimsy. We have broken it twice. Then, finding parts to repair it is an phone 'menu' nightmare. Would not recommend this product."
1,Attic Dek,"First, the 24 Inch Attic Dek is not a square panel, as you might think. This fact could be important when you plan your layout. Each panel is 16x24 square inches. I don't know if this constitutes false advertising. So with four units you end up covering 10 square feet, which is not very much considering the cost: $45 plus $10 shipping and handling. On the other hand, the 16 Inch Attic Dek is square and contains 8 units (14.2 square feet) for the same cost.Second, the distance between the joists has to be within a very small tolerance 24 inches. The distance between the joists where I intended to install the Attic Dek is roughly 1/8 inch less than 24 inches (my luck). As a consequence the tabs were not flush to the joist and the installation was impossible. The panels did lie flat between the next pair of joists, but that left a gap between the attic opening and the Attic Dek. Guess how I filled the gap? This raises the another question: Why use Attic Dek?"
5,Very happy I have this,"I went to best buy and the guy told me this product didnt exhist.. too funny! I love this product. it works great no lag, screen resolution is perfect. this by far is one of the best purchases Ive made from amazon."
4,1=2,"If you're looking for the simple things in life, try this.Very easy to set up, and learning how to extend wasn't that hard.(mostly dragging and clicking) The picture on the second monitor is very close to the primary monitor, and as far as text is concerned, there's no difference.I ran some sporting events from my primary computer through a 25' cable, and the action was almost the same as primary, but the picture wasn't quite as clear.If you're looking for average to above average quality, this is it."
2,Disposable,"I ordered a bunch of these for my work crews and no one was impressed. They break easily and are not durable at all. Not recommended, unless you like disposable chargers!"
3,Osmium 187 Is Bomb Component,"Osmium 187 is a component of nuclear bombs, not the fissionable material.""The security services keep the illegal trade in precious metals under constant control, but the sale of osmium-187 attracted their attention also for another reason. It is a strategic dual-purpose material used in the defence industry as a catalyst to increase the blast range of a nuclear bomb. """
5,Very useful and fun,"I found this dictionary very useful to learn English words. I often play in different word games on it to enlarge my vocabulary. What I really adore about this dictionary is the touch-sensitive display, it's fun to send emails and do everything with a small stylus!I have specially chosen this dictionary to have the TOEFL listening comprehension and all the other tests as well as grammar reference.The dialogues for every day situations have often helped me when I had no idea how to say something in English.My dictionary translates all the words and even common phrases and idioms. And the most important for me is that it not only pronounces clearly everything, but records my pronunciation, so I can always compare them and speak better. English pronunciation is so different from the Russian one ...Thanks to this dictionary, I speak English much better now. :)"
5,Complete Aromatherapy Handbook,Informative! This book is chocked full of information on essential oils. Written and organized in easy to follow format. The blending recipes are a real treat for any beginner. Although this is a paper back (large edition)the graphics and color are eyecatching. THIS BOOK IS A WELCOME ADDITION TO MY REFERENCE LIBRARY ON AROMATHERAPY.
5,Chicago Rose is fabulous!,"This CD uplifts me in the morning. It's upbeat, yet mellow. I like to have my morning cup of coffee & plan my day with her sweet voice singing in the background. My favorite song is I Am a Butterfly. It speaks to me because I feel like I'm a butterfly too, soaring on my dreams & looking for a love to glide along with me."
1,great disappointment,Stay away from this seller!The perfume turned out to be either fake or old and the cap did not fit. Did not smell good.Legendz requested return for analysis. I requested a shipping call tag from them since my UPS store would not accept the perfume for return shipment. It is 'Hazardous Material'.Have not heard from them since. It has been over a week!

2,Broken Dreams!,"Although the Manchester Glassware set came before the estimated date (Target Stores), two of the glasses were broken due to the poorly packed box it came in. I was so hoping to have these glasses for my new apartment. So disapointed. I most likely will go to the Target store here in NYC and see if I can get them there. At least I know they won't be broken when I bring them home! Better luck next time:("
5,Great,"This Receiver is great! Plenty of settings to fit any room, plenty of power and works great with my JBL 12"" sub, Klipsch front speakers, and a Bose center channel."
3,A too compliacted war,"I was born and lived in Moambique for over 25 years .This book has a lot of interesting information but some of the facts are distorted by interviews to some of the people envolved . I found this ""normal"" in many books and TV as reporters are limited to some parts of the population and their ""under influence"" oppinnions . There are also some errors on personal information about influent Mozambique politicians .Some of the info on colonial behaviour and facts is not correct and certainly received from the ""wrong"" sources .In general , is an interesting book , but to be read with some reserves ."
5,MARINES CHICKA,"LOVE THIS SHIRT I WEAR WHEN I GO SKATING ITS A BEAUTIFUL SKATE ATTIRE WHENEVER I SKATE, AND AGAIN THE SAME WITH MY RED MARINE SHIRT WHEN I WASH IT IT NEVER FADES"
2,A tutorial on some heavy issues,"First: This book is written on a very liberal slant. If that bothers you, don't read it. The author obviously has an agenda here, but an intelligent reader will glean arguments from both sides of the abortion issue. Secondly, it is not an easy read. The issues it deals with are complex and the author delves into them in some detail.If you are one who wants to hear a comprehensive discourse on the pros and cons of late term abortion, this book will arm you with both arguments. If you consider yourself a liberal politically, this book will stroke you the right way. If you consider yourself conservative, the author's attitude towards your philosophy will irritate and perhaps anger you. All in all, this book is well written, though opinionated...It is probably great for a political science afficionado, but it is not your typical thriller. It may also be too long because of its dense subject matter."
3,"If You Like ""The West Wing"" . . .","This book has two halves. The first is an abortion debate presented through the vehicle of a sometimes realistic/sometimes not courtroom drama. This half is full of gory detail and emotional manipulation. Not my cup of tea, and I almost stopped. The second half of the book is a Supreme Court confirmation fight in the style of a West Wing television show --- fun and clever, though the characters are charicatured good guys and bad guys (with the Democratic president head ""good guy""). Patterson's page-turning writing skill is on display throughout.While so much of the book echoes real-life political debates and (even more) real life politics, I also found it curiously dated. 1998 --- pre 9/11, pre the Bush years, still in the Lewinsky scandal --- when this book was written had a remarkably different political landscape. So recent and yet so long ago. Protect and Defend will remind you of it, but it will not make you want to go back."
3,"Some new hikes, but prefered style of Bradt book.",Good introduction to hiking in Bolivia but found author's style unprofessional. Overall useful for treks but also used Trekking in Peru and Bolivia which was better but also had problems. Buy maps and learn Spanish! Hikes around Sorata are great!!!!!
4,Offers many alternatives to the standard gringo trade routes,We were looking for off the beaten path backpack trips. In Brain's book we found the standard 'Inca Trail' routes that everyone writes about in addition to trips where we would saw no other tourist for several days. There are about 3 times as many routes described in Brain's book compared to the Brandt Guide. Also we found the Brain book more up to date. The only disappointment was that some of the descriptions were just plain incorrect. I got a feeling that this book was rushed to press.
1,Did not fit on my 02 sequoia limited,"Did not work on my 2002 Toyota sequoia limited, may be because it is the jbl radio on the limited"
2,Blows the first one out of the water!,"With the emporers death, two men, Bishop Herrith and Count Renato Biagio both believe they are worthy to rule Nar, but are they? Richious is in exile in some other country, the name slips me right now, and is called by bishop Herrith to defeat Renato Biagio's army, so that he can take the throne. While fighting Biagio's army, Richious has his doughts. Full of suspence and intrege this is better than volume one! I recomend buying number one first then reading this. What a great series!"
3,sharpies!,"I love sharpies! I think of them as crayolas for grown up and they are fun. I would have liked the yellows and pastel colors to be more vivid though, but the darker colors are okay."
5,Item as decribed - perfect for our party,"We bought these for a dinner party. Bought a large drop cloth from Big Lots and handed out 3 sharpies to each guest and encouraged them to doodle their art/words during the six course meal. Everyone really got into it and now we plan on doig this again for our next party. Havent washed the ""tablecloth"" yet, so dont know if the colors will bleed."
5,Don't You Ever Learn?,"So many folks don't get it about side 1 of this album. It wasn't just a tribute, or the whole project would have been covers. The point is, Todd was always capable of doing anything anyone else did. That's why he was successful in working in the studio with such a diverse group of artists. At the same time he needed to express himself in his own unique style, all the while tryin' to make a living off an L.P.'s worth of tunes. ""Faithful"" is still one of my favorite efforts by an oft misunderstood genius. Don't judge it just enjoy it."

4,"""One of the funniest movies I have seen""","Have only seen this movie once, and to me it ranks right up there with Monty Python and the holy grail. I could not stop laughing."
5,"Does the job, without too much dust.","I purchased this blade to cut holes in hardy board when I was replacing the siding on my house. The main reason this blade is needed is because it reduces the amount of dust generated when cutting. It cuts a bit slower than a standard blade, but not enough to make me switch to a dustier version.I used the blade for a few small holes and even used it to cut out some windows, as it was easier than using the circular saw, which even with a low dust blade made enough dust that I feared my neighbors would complain about the wall of dust blowing over the fence."
1,Horrible!,"I got the movie because I like the actors. I read a bunch of good reviews, so decided to get it. What a dissapointment. I hated the movie. Who ever filmed this, was not a pro! The whole movie was just NOT THAT GOOD. I wish I didnt get it."
2,"too much ""bad"" words","good story, not such a good setting, not such good work with the cameras, and the way they talk is just.. WHAT!!????"
5,Kid loves it!,"My 3-year-old loves Pooh and his friends and the DVDs are not loud like some others, so I can easily deal with it around the house. Plus there is nothing scary or anything that I should be concerned about, as it sometimes happens even in G-rated movies (thinking about a 3 year old, of course). So I love it too!!!"
4,"it's not the heffalump movie, but....","My 3 year old daughter loves most things Winnie the Pooh, especially the Piglet movie, the Heffalump movie, and the original adventures of Pooh. This one isn't quite on par with those, but it's not nearly as bad as the Valentine DVD or the Growing Up with Pooh DVD's. Those truly must make Walt Disney cringe in his grave. My daughter has no interest in those, but she does ask for this Springtime DVD often. Rabbit is quite cranky throughout most of it, but not so much as to scare my daughter. In fact, she turned to me and said ""I like Rabbit!"". She knows that's just how Rabbit is. She's more excited about the fact that there's lots of Roo in this one."
3,ok movie,I didn't think this was as cute of a movie or as interesting as some of the other pooh movies. Too complicated for my toddler audience though she seemed to enjoy ok. Does not ask to see it over and over though like the Heffalump movie or the new pooh movie.
2,Sorry,My kids have not been expose to Winnie the Pooh... I didn't like it because it failed to hold their attention... 2& 3 year old boys
4,Miles From Home,"Good movie, filmed in my home state, Iowa, and a few scenes were filmed in my hometown, Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Brought back lots of great memories of my hometown back in the late 80's, and overall a good movie."
4,Nothing But The Truth,"I really enjoyed this movie. This is not the only resource that we are running out of, but that,s another story........."
2,Not worth the money,"I assumed it was a good product because of Rick Steve. Well, he maybe an expert on travel but he's like everyone else with merchandizing.This neck wallet seems to be well made and that's about the only good comment I can make. It has a vinyl/plastic insert that just sit in main pocket. and it doesn't seal. So if you want to protect anything from getting wet or soaked, get a ziploc bag and keep it dry. Trust me, when you have money, check, or any documents that gets soaked because of your sweat, this won't protect it. plastic liner doesn't sit in there too well either.If you want someting more reliable, pick anything but this. Same goes for the money belt."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"In this novel, Count Saint-Germain's weakness for women comes back tohaunt him in a major way, and for a very long period of time. Hecreates another vampire, around 1500 years ago.She, however, ignores any advice or other information he has givenher, and sets out to do what she wants to do, setting herself up as aruler and despot."
4,Well mastered and mixed for surround.,"Hi, first of all, I'm no big fan of c. dion. i'm fan of music. This may be a 5 star but I dont think it's that perfect because live music is never as good as studio versions, however this concert is very well recorded, unlike other concerts i've heard on surround, this one has the voice on the center and the instruments on the rest so background music comes from the back speakers and so on. that's a very good thing to enyou music because most of the concerts in surroud they only have the surround channels to play the echoes of the venue, who wants that? So this is good, if you like celine dion and have a surround sound system, get this. Thanks."
5,Celinerrrrrrrrrific!,"This is a great DVD filled with wonderful bonuses! It's also sold at a great price! You have access behind the scenes and it just makes me wonder why I never attened the concert myself! This is a must-have for any Celine fan! Celine is a true artist and her personality shines throughout the DVD. She is just an icon that everyone should look up to. She is wonderful, and they made a superb dvd. The songs are wonderful, she sings her best hits! This gets a triple A plus from me!"
4,CELINE in Las Vegas,Celine Dion recently closed her 5 year stint in Las Vegas. My friend saw the concert (140 dollars for cheap seats) and loved the show. I bought the DVD as a Christmas present for her so Patty will remember Celine's A NEW DAY forever. 5 hours of Celine for 16 dollars is a pretty good deal...Teri
5,Celine - simply the greatest female performer in decades,"This is the most wonderful music DVD I own - and I own lots. This performance is truly exciting, memorable, and exudes of love. The stage is the biggest I have ever seen and the dancing was perfection, seductive, and very well performed.I suggest that everyone have this DVD - you will not regret that decision."
2,Blu-Ray DVD,"I was very excited to know that the Celine Dion Las Vagas act was coming out on the Blu-Ray DVD that I pre-ordered in advanced through Amazon. Having not being able to attend the concert this would be the next best thing. However when I received the DVD it was defective with static sound three quarters into the DVD. I expressed my concerns to Amazon and was amazed with the customer service by agreeing to replace the DVD. I have since than received the replacement, but was disappointed that the static problem is the on replacement as well. I am not sure if this is an manufracture error. I am curious to know if other customers who ordered this DVD expressed this same problem. Any regards I am at a lost as what to do next. I am considering whether to purchase another copy at my local mall (forefeit my cost) and keep my finger crossed.Shirley"
1,Buy in USA only,This came from Australia and could not play on my DVD player. From now on I only buy from the USA
2,Don't think the author really get's it,"A lot of simple errors in the book that were not caught, boring drible, and a complete lack of any ""inside knowledge"" into a very interesting person. Who funded the reseach of Ian Halperin? they obviously knew Ian about as well as they know James Taylor."
4,Good Bio,"Nothing compares to JT's music. Not even Dylan, Simon or Mitchell. The man continues to creat magic - and the author certainly captured the magic of his great career. The intimate details of his life growing up in North Carolina to his legendary marriage to Carly Simon, Taylor has led a most interesting life. Highly recommended!"
2,Blah Blah Blah,"I was really curious about this one, and buying it, I thought... ""Wow. I've always been Curious about him."" Well, this book gives you a few answers, but for the most part it's a boring look at an obviously exciting and dramatic life story. And what is up with Halperin's ridiculous over-use of ""Taylor"" to describe James. It's almost as if he has no real variance in his writing style. I would also wager that there are quotes attributed to Taylor that weren't actually uttered, such as this gem... ""It's time for me to express myself with my music now."" I mean, come on...Who Says That? No one. Sorry Halperin. Stick to covering Dead Grunge rockers,'cause that's really your forte. Useless Claptrap, and a waste of American Dollareedoos. For Shaaaaame!"
2,Somebody Help Halperin!,"What I learned by reading this book:1) Ian Halperin has mastered the CUT and PASTE functions on his computer. Much of the material was regurgitation of unoriginal work.2) Unauthorized biographers must get paid by the page. Why else would he stretch so little information into this lengthy work that reads like a high school term paper.This book will satisfy the james taylor superfan, but really only as another piece to add to the collection. In other words if you paid hundreds of dollars to have a bootleg recording of one of his early concerts, you should buy this book. Otherwise, I suggest another source for insight into what JT is all about: James Taylor records."
5,Yaaaawwwn!,"While having ""trouble sleeping"" last night, I listened to this song and was soon sleeping like a baby! This is definetly recommended for those with insomnia!"
4,fun but you need a game patch for windows 7,You have to get online and get a game patch so you can go to the 2nd poker game at 7 or the computer will go black and you can't go any futher. Other than that I really like the game. I love the Sims games so if you like that you will enjoy this too!
2,Bug Zone,"This game is full of bugs, In order to play this game, I had to buy another video card. So this game got really expensive quick. I still haven't been able to get very far in the game because it freezes up. I wouldn't waste my money again for this game or anything like it til the bugs are gone."
3,Good but short,"I loved playing this game, but the story line is short. The only thing left to do after you finish the story is to start over, but maybe play the story line differently. Beside that, this game is very interesting."
3,Desperate Housewives,I liked playing this game. There are a lot of things for you to do and it is fun to be able to choose what your person looks like and you can do things how you want and at your own pace. After the fourth or fifth level it always crashes though so I don't know how the end of the games is. If you don't mind missing out on part of the game I do think it is pretty fun.
3,Finally - I can play it!!!!,"Well I got this game for my birthday last year and like many people I couldn't play it on my pc or my son's brand new pc. I put it away and thought about it every now and then. I just got a new notebook pc for my birthday this year and decided I would give it a try. I had hopes but prepared myself for the likely chance that it wouldn't work. To my surpirse it worked great! And ran smoothly too. For those of you wondering I have a Dell Inspiron 1521 (pink) and got it for $880, but I added dvd burner and webcam so it was cheaper to begin with. Good luck!"
1,Could not get through,"Obviously, many people love this book, including the amazon reviewers. I have read great quite a bit of the Holocoaut literature.I could not get past page 150 of this book. (I put in down earlier, and gave it a second try, but, as noted, it was unsuccessful.)I found the biblical digressions tedious, and the book cried out for editing. It also was self-indulgent, approproiate for a memoir, but for me this did not work at all for me in the context of a search for the story behind the loss of the author's great uncle and his four daughters.I am obviously in the minority here - the professional reviews and the amazon reader reviews were very positive - but that was my subjective reaction to the book.And I cannot remember the last time I ever did not finish a book I started."
2,Way too long,"I bought this book because I am very much interested in reading and learning about the Holocaust. I think Mendelsohn's search for his family members would have been a fascinating story; however, the rambling way he has written the book and the numerous, unnecessary asides really detracted from the main story line."
5,lost,"While reading an interview with Lee Child in the New York Times book review. Mr Childs recommended this book. If Lee Childs liked it, I wanted to read it and I was not disappointed, read on"
4,The first half is wonderful,"This is a poignant book about a man's search for his Jewish ancestors lost in the Holocaust. I found the first half of the book entrancing, but eventually it turned into more a story of searching than a story of findings. Perhaps if I had continued to the end I would have renewed my interest. It is definitely worth starting."
2,This is really a best seller?,"This book is painfully long and repetitive. I'm on page 35 and I doubt that I will be able to finish the entire book. Once you begin to get into the history of the family, the author veers completely off topic. Frustrating. Irritating.I want to love this book, and I'm sure that there is a wonderful story somewhere in the mass of pages, I'm just not sure I will have the patience to find it."
2,Engineers made the machine on a Friday!!,"The Machine works well.But if you have money to burn for ink, this is your machine. It will not fuction unless all of the ink cartriges are full. Example; say you are printing a black & white document only, if your yellow or blue is out, you will not be able print anything.This ink is not cheap at all. The three colors will run you about $40. The black ink will run you $25.Do you really want to pay $65 every three months on ink when you can buy a brand new HP 640 for $59? Until Brother can improve the ink system, LEAVE THIS ITEM ON THE SHELF!"
2,"""Too Dead For Me""..","Quite Frankly/Bluntly, I must say I love ATR very much so, but this is one album in particular that I rarely listen to... I give it two stars, an extra one cos it's ATR.. but I think the album lacks the quality of the previously released album (Burn Berlin Burn) in some ways and the lyrics at times don't flow as smoothly.. I'd have to say, the rare occasion on which I do play this album, it's 'better' songs might be 'Too Dead For Me' and perhaps 'Revolution Action' an..mmm 'By Any Means Necessary'..."
1,Not happy,"I'm used to HP's that print, don't jam too much and last for years. I've had this for less than 6 months and it jams half the time. I wanted a fax/copy/printer all in one, and what I got is something that 6 months later, I may need to replace. I don't even know if I can get any money back on this. what am I going to say on e-bay - used printer / scanner / copier / fax, bought last year - Jams every other page - piece of junk but makes a good paperweight. Not Happy. :-(I regret that I didn't pay more and go with another company. I'm never buying Samsung again."
3,"Prints well, but LOUD!","Well, the subject said it. To be clear, I have it next to me in a large quiet office environment. When it prints, I sometime have to get up and go get a drink. It's that loud! Wish I can find my sound level meter here. Buy it, if you can put it in a different room; if you can't, skip it."
5,Solid no-nonsense workhorse of a printer,"It is very seldom that a product inspires someone as lazy as me to take the time to write a positive review online. But a year's worth of solid performance from this all-in-one printer leaves me little choice but to leave a few words of praise for it here. It is not the fanciest printer out there - does not have wireless connectivity, no color printing, no photographs. But what it does, it does very well. In a year of steady B/W printing output, I have had only one instance of a paper jam and that too because the blank paper in the feeder had a fold in it. The scan quality is decent. Fax works great. If you do not need to print fancy graphics and need a reliable printer for day to day activities, this is the machine for you. It is one of the best value for money buys in my household. I wish the big bucks pinter stations that ones finds in the offices were as good as this one."
1,Battery problem etc,"I have the battery probelm, too. I am going to try scotch tape now. Actually this is my second one, as the first one didn't work at all from the begining. I think... should stop selling the products from Ectaco. Another thing is that the reaction of key bourd is very slow. Overall, I feel like the technology of this company is about 40 yrs behind. It's pity that franklin or seiko don't have italian dictionary with decent amount of vocaburary.As for the content, I wish it had the idiom search for Italian. This seems to be made for the italians learning english basically."
2,Bad book about a bad man,"Said Aburish downplays much of the evil of Yasir Arafat.At his core, Arafat is a terrorists and a murderer. Arafat hates not only Israel, but the west.Even if you are not pro-Israel, what people don't realize is that Yasir Arafat was killing American's way back in the 1960's and 1970's.He was responsible for the killing if US Ambassador Cleo Noel Jr. in 1973."
3,ok,"While I agree with some of the things he says, such as his views on Saddam, I do not think he truely understands the situation that Arafat is in. If Arafat is as corrupt as the author claims, maybe he is, that still does not explain the actions of Sharon. If the jewish state truely wanted peace, the peace plan offered by Barak years ago would have never been taken off the table, it is obvious that isreal wants peace on its terms,which means the land. It wants peace but, also wants the land. Even if Arafat was the most honest leader that still would not have given the palastinian people a truely viable, seperate state, free of constant incurtions from isreali toops. The peace plan of Barak did not address the settlements, which would have given Isreal the excuse to keep its toops in the Palastinian state. Consider this, would americans have liked the fact that after their revolution, the British were able to keep their toops in their cities, I think not"
2,"Don't buy, if your an American you have already paid for it!","First of all FM 3-25.150 was created with U.S. tax dollars. It is awful that someone would reprint it in order to make money off something that you the tax paying citizen has already paid for. Go look online before you buy it here.My second point has to do with the graphics. Simply put, what you are buying is a no frills army manual with a fancy cover on it. (once again something your tax dollars have already paid for!) If you have taken this training before it will be a great refresher. However if you haven't I would recommend ""H2H"" by Greg Thompson. His book will show you full color pictures of how to do many of the same things in the combatives manual and is quite better written which will help you understand how the moves work better."
4,Learned and rich.,"Motz draws upon many years of study in mythology and folklore to examine how female dieties are represented in various traditional cultures (Baltic, Germanic, Siberian, Near Eastern, Ancient Mexican, Japanese). The result is a complex view of goddesses as both creative and destructive, dominant and subservient. The first three chapters are given over to a critical review of the purported ancient European ""Goddess Religion"" that was supposedly swept aside by violent, patriarchical, storm-god worshipping nomads. Motz shows that the evidence for such a belief system is shaky and subject to differing interpretation. Not always an easy read due to a rather academic writing style, ""Faces of the Goddess"" is very rewarding."
2,2 stars is generous,"I was deeply dissapointed in this short story. I love the original tale of Cupid and Psyche and this slimmed down ""book"" offered no decent narration or descriptions. It was tiny and i finished it in under an hour with plenty of time left for regret that i ever purchased it. It is more of a child's novel than anything and stumbles awkwardly over deeper themes. Not a book for any lover of the ancient gods (or books for that matter)."
5,M Schnell,"Very good unit, i really like the maxtor equipment. i have two ofthe Maxtor 500 Gb units and both are excellent units."
5,I love this,"I love this book because I have the National Audubon Society First Field Guide for reptiles and I would often run in to reptile that the I couldn't Identify. I knew that I needed a bigger better book. So I bought the western and eastern Peterson Field guide for reptiles and amphibians and it had a lot more reptiles and it had amphibians which I never had a book that had information about them before, it has a lot more reptiles and it's shows you were they are each located. It give you a detailed description of each animal and a detailed drawing of each animal. Because of this I have been able to identify reptiles and amphibian that I couldn't before. I don't like that they use drawing of the animals instead of pictures and the drawings just show the heads of the snakes."
3,Well meaning film and great actresses take on sexual harrassment.,Charlize Theron portrays a single mom who takes on the system after going to work at a mine that seemingly employs about 5 women and every macho pervert in the town.Theron is good in the part though not as good as she was in Monster.Part of the problem is that Monster was much more than a serial killer film while North Country is pretty straightforward and sees things in terms of black and white.The acting is good and the message to stand up for yourself and coworkers is inspiring but unfortunately as a film North Country is often bland and very predictable.If you can overlook it's faults you'll like this earnest film but Norma Rae it's not.
2,what a waste of charlize theron,"waited so long for the dvd movie to come out, but what a disappointment! bad screenplay, bad directing and bad editing, oh, what a shame and what a waste of ms theron's talent. the screenplay is so bad that i have to resist myself from cursing during viewing, what a waste of those good casts, males or females, they are supposed to be all top-notched great actors and actresses, but simply ruined and wasted by a lame deadbeat screenplay and a mediocre director. this movie is horrible to watch, not the sexual harassment scenes but one of the worst screenplays and the directors."
5,IT'S ONLT ME BUT:,"GOOD STORY ABOUT A SINGLE MOM TRYING TO IMPROVE HER LIFE WORKING A A COAL MINE TO EARN MORE MONEY. SHOWS THE PREJUDICE SHOWN BY THE MEN WHO DON'T WANT WOMEN TO WORK THERE. A SECONDARY ISSUE IS THE STORY ABOUT THE RAPE THAT RESULTED IN HER SON, THAT SHE HAS NEVER TALKED ABOUT. IT ALL COMES OUT IN THE END. JM"
5,Junior Kills,"This CD smokes and is an absolute joy to listen to--a virtual eargasam! Junior's guit-steel playing is a cross between Dick Dale, Stevie Ray Vaughn and a roto-tiller on steroids. The recording is crystal clear and makes it seem as though you are at the Continental Club with the other Junior music addicts."
3,little one undecided about this one,"At first my little one did not like this one bit, but she is a little different (she hates the car). However, after several weeks she started using it, but hasn't claimed it to be her favorite teether (wish she would find one she loved, due to extensive teething and biting me)."
3,"Good, but not great","The book starts off well, with an exciting look into a future world where you can literally be in two places at once. It explores interesting issues, such as what it means to be human, and puts an ironic twist on race relations and bigotry.Unfortunately, the book runs out of steam towards the end as Brin attempts to tie up the loose ends. Still, I must admit to enjoying the last few scenes (with the requisite gathering of the suspects for a final ""whodunnit"" moment).I enjoyed the book, and it's definitely worth reading, but Brin has written far better stuff in the past."
4,"A long read, but worth it","Kiln People is a book that defies easy description, it is definitely science fiction but beyond that broad categorization, it fails to fall easily into any niche - it's original.This book was a tough read, not because it's a bad book - it's good! But because it is so information dense, you have to really pay attention while reading it. Brin throws out ideas left and right with little or no backstory, assuming that the reader lives in the society described, which we, of course, don't. This is a technique used to great effect by Heinlein, and Brin uses it nearly as well.The story blends murder mystery, scifi, and the golem legend together and spits out something completely new, while tackling deep questions like ""Who am I?"" and ""Where do we go when we die?"" I guess the best way to describe the actual density of this book is to compare it to the average SF novel - I read 6-7 of these a week, about 1 a day. Kiln People took me 5 days to finish."
5,Even more beautiful than expected.,"These pieces have got to be some of the most delightful flatware pieces I have ever seen. Nicely weighted and incredibly stylish with unexpected lines. Perfect understated ""wow"" factor for your table. I had no problems like 1st reviewer; my set was consistently high-quality."
2,Read A Christmas Carol instead,This short story owes a great deal to Dickens's A Christmas Carol. Instead of wasting your time reading a second rate knock off go to the original. It may be longer but it is a much better written story and you will be more satisfied.
4,Not as bad as they say.,"I found Captain America to be a good film in all,Matt Salinger is terrific as Captain America in his cool outfit,and Scott Paulin is good as the Red Skull."
3,the red skull movie,"this clumsy little dork gets turnrd vinto a super althete and goes to fight a nazi with a red skull.the movie shows a lot more of the red skull than its star captain america.cap also wasnt a killer and in the movie he decapitates many enemies with his adamanite shield.this one is far too violent for the kiddies.as far as marvel comic movies go,this one-while good-is the least good of the whole batch.oh!except nick fury,its worse."
3,hard to find. cheesy but worth it,This movie is very hard to find but i hadnt seen it since i was little. Really bad movie but worth the purchase
3,i loved it!,from what i hear is that they ran out os money in the first scene where he fights red skull so that is why he runs around for an hour or so in street clothes.So before you bash this movie i just wanted to let you know why it never made it big.Plus they just wanted to make a comic movie in the recent rave of batman and all(they also ruined the punisher for the same reason.)I also hear they want val kilmer or brad pitt to play cap.good luck!
2,"BE WARNED, a good version, but very disapointing DVD quality.","Seen on TV many years ago, this Captain America version stands up very well today, however, the master that this DVD is made from, is of very poor quality. OK, this is an Authentic "" Region O "" import, but most (not all) DVD's made available this way, that I have seen, are from top quality, crystal clear, source material, but this is a disappointing, dark, grainy version on the DVD, similar to the lowest VHS picture quality, you could possibly imagine, maybe 1 out of 10 & the sound is not much better at 3/10.Overall, a very disappointing DVD, of so poor quality that it won't be added to my collection. The day's when buyers & collector's, like myself, would accept inferior quality material, just to own your very own copy, are long gone & I won't lower my standards, as rubbish is still rubbish, no matter what format it is presented in.BE WARNED, don't waste your money!( The 2 star rating is for the DVD quality only! )"
2,Bad Copy,Item came on time but the video is crap! It came from Thailand and there are English and Thai soundtracks but only Thai subtitles. The video is straight from VHS and in 4:3 format. Only half of the menu is responsive to inputs. Had to make my selections and back out the hard way to play the movie. The movie itself is what you should expect from a 1990 point of view.
3,Dash Diet Book,I havent read the entire book yet but what I have read I think will be very helpful in learning how to eat right and lose weight.
2,Dash off the list.,"Although Amazon got the doctor recommended book to me quickly, I found the book to be nearly useless to try to follow. I read the book and, of course, wanted to try the diet, but sadly, there were too few recipes."
3,I had a hard time with it,The food selection wasn't what I was looking for and too restrictive for my trucker husband to follow. He can't store let alone cook at the times and methods required in this book. Personally I don't think I could stay on that diet for the rest of my life.
2,Useless for Me,This diet plan was recommended by a doctor. I was told this book would be helpful. I found it hard to follow.
4,Better Than I Thought,"I began reading the book as soon as it came in. The next day I started applying the guidelines. And while not everyone has my genes I lost 5lbs the first 5 days. I supplemented ketchup for fresh salsa (low sodium) on my 3 eggs for breakfast. When I had a sugar craving I ate yogurt and apples. And stuck with turkey, chicken and fish as the main protein for dinner. While losing 5 lbs maybe ideal for others, my doctor told me to try the DASH plan for a low sodium diet and I am prone to high blood pressure. Losing 5 lbs so quick, scared me. So I doubled my serving sizes and the weight is slowly returning though some much of the food can be metabolized. I'm 125 when drenched in Nickelodeon slime. Some weight gain would do me some good. This book helps pin point what foods to include and others to exonerate. Love it."
3,"Good book, but not much new here","This is based on exercise and weight loss.. It gives good tips for devising a weight loss plan, food substitutions and good foods to create a healthy eating plan... a sensible approach, but nothing extrodinary or out of the normal type of plan. I like it, but think it's just so so."
3,not a lot of new information,"The book was okay, but it didn't have a lot of information that you can't already find on their website. It was quite disappointing to be quite honest."
3,Dash Diet Action Plan,"The book was informational and the content well organized However, I was not inspired by the writing skill of the author. I found the book very easy to put down."
3,Miracle Food Cures,Miracle Food Cures for the Bible this was ok. I helped somewhat. I passed it on to my sister-Girl. She is reading it now.
1,BORED,"tHIS HAD TO BE ONE OF THE DRYEST, MOST BORING BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. THE HERO WAS TOO ARROGANT AND HARD, NEVER REALLY GOT REDEEMED.THE BEST PART OF THE BOOK WAS ITS COVER. HOWEVER, I DISLIKE WASTING MY HARD-EARNED MONEY ON A BOOK COVER. i USUALLY LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF USED COPIES AVAILABLE AND HOW LONG THE BOOK HAS VBEEN ON THE SHELF. IF THE BOOK HAS A LOT OF USED, LIKE THIS DOES, THAT MEANS IT IS A LESS THAN SATISFYING READ."
3,What I would expect for a Steves' book for content,"However, the book is quite small. It is much shorter and generally smaller in size than his other books and should probably not cost as much as larger more informative books cost. I don't know how accurate the prices are but the descriptions are engaging and interesting."
3,bass ackwards,"This album was not what I was expecting. The production quality is 10x better than the Warcloud albums, but Holocaust seems to have adopted another rhyme style on this album that I don't particularly like. His delivery is inconsistent and rambling, and only really sounds good on a few tracks. ""Monarchs"" is my personal favorite. This album was completely the opposite of the Warcloud albums, the production is great, but the rhymes are okay at best."
2,Memories of childhood,"I bought this CD because one of the songs on the album was a song I loved when I was a very young child in Public School back in 1945 or so. I was a big fan of Jerry Lewis back then, so I bought the CD to listen to the song once again. The whole CD is typically Jerry Lewis ""schtick"" and of course by today's standards is very silly. It's all good fun and also good for a few giggles."
3,"Good book, but...","Talks way too much about Satan. I don't buy that Satan or Lucifer crap. I was raised on it to the point that I was deathly afraid of going to hell. I like what she says about abortions, though. Picket lines and threats won't solve anything."
4,No Installation Disk!!,"I have been using my Brother IntelliFax 1940cn for almost a year now and I am very pleased with it. As others have mentioned in their reviews, there is NO Installation Disk packaged with this printer. You're forced to download them from Brother's web site and it is not immediately apparent which drivers/applications you need. I am using this as a shared network device and and it works great as both a printer and Fax. One of the reviewers here mentioned a problem with the drivers in Windows XP. I don't know what they're referring to because mine works great with Windows XP. The documentation is very detailed and does a good job explaining the advanced features of this printer/Fax. I give it 4 stars because of the burden placed on the consumer to figure out on their own which drivers/applications they need to download from Brother's web site instead of just including an installation disk like almost every other computer hardware manufacturer does."
1,Brother? Don't bother!,"We wanted an all-in-one machine that does fax and has answering system, and this was one of the few in the market. Shouldn't have bothered. Reasons: 1) Abismal voice quality on the phone and phone message. A phone message is particularly bad, you cannot understand a thing. 2) Fax is SLOW-- don't trust whatever they say on the box or in the manual. 3) For some unknown reason, the answering machine cuts off people calling on certain cell phones. Either they are cut off in the middle of the message, or they hear one ring, and the phone hangs up on them. 4) The ink jet cartridge goes out very quickly. 5) Very flimsy plastic tray, part of it broke off only after a few weeks' use. Overall, very poor quality that the Japanese company should be ashamed of. After only 6 months, I am looking for a replacement, but I haven't a clue where to look. Certainly not Brother's machines."
4,This Game,"I really liked this game because it's pretty good for something on a gameboy. It was a little slow and bumpy and the sound I couldn't always hear, but overall I liked it. I hope you found this helpful!"
5,Another Great One,"What can I say, another great one by Sabrina Jeffries. Since I read my first book by her, I have made it a point to read every book she has written. I Love the whole Swanlea Spinsters series. As always, ""After The Abduction"" sucked me right in to their world. I love the characters. This book was as steamy as all the rest. I like the way one story leads into the next in this series. I'm reading the story of the real Morgan now, ""Dance of Seduction"" and loving it to...."
3,Early Travolta?!,"I had to write this only because at least two reviews here comment that this is ""early Travolta.""Saturday Night Fever (1977) / Staying Alive (1983) (Double Feature),Grease (Rockin' Rydell Edition), andWelcome Back, Kotter - The Complete First Season, are early Travolta. He has been famous since the mid 70's and I'd hardly call this movie -- when John Travolta was almost 40 years old -- representative of his ""early"" work. But, hey, I guess that says something for his continued appeal.Regarding the movie itself, it was okay but nothing special. The acting is fine, and the dog is amazing, but the story (when it's not dealing directly with the relationship between the girl and the dobe) is rather boring.So if you love dogs...this is worth a look if it shows up on cable, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it."
2,Pioneering Effort but now obsolete,"This was a pioneering effort -I'm glad this person took the time to master Inuktitut and write a guide for the rest of us(although the goal of much early Inuktitut language materials in English was to teach missionaries the language which led to suppression and devastation of the Inuit culture). Luckily, this grammer has been replaced by more modern guides (""google"" the Nunavut Artic College for state-of-the-art Inuktitut learning materials which are actually produced by and for the Inuit themselves)."
2,"Worked for a while, but not worth it","I picked this up one day from the Vitamin Shoppe as I was in need for a cheap shaker bottle. It seemed to work well at first as long as you made sure to close the lid tightly, which wasn't always easy. It usually took a minute or two to get it on properly and make sure it was tight in order to prevent leaking. After a couple of months of use, the rubber that keeps the lid tightly in place began to tear. Needless to say that without it, it leaks. It's hard to say to avoid such a cheap item, but save yourself the trouble and go with a shaker that snaps on. Much easier to get on and off, I've never had leaking issues, and also doesn't have any grooves in case you decide to drink directly from the container. I've have good luck with Tupperware personally."
4,eh.....it's ok,I have 2 of these. The work pretty well. I do occasionally get a leak and can't really figure out why. I screw it on pretty tight. For the most part though there are no leaks and they are fine.
3,Not Bad.,"The service was good and I received the item quickly. The major thing though is that it leaks fairly often. Sometimes it's okay, but other times I have to unscrew and rescrew the cap on several times before I can get it to be leak free. Overall, it's an okay product."
1,sub standard,"Poor quality product. leaks and spills every time. the 'bodytech' logo is completely gone after only 6 months of use. Although, it gets the job done, never got any lumps in my protein shake. I generally shake for 20-25 seconds. It's also easy to wash. I had to ditch this shaker and buy a new Optimum Nutrition shaker."
4,Perfect for racing fans,If you are a racing fan this book will take you along on a fun ride with one of the toughest riders to ever hit the track. Find out which horses Gary thought were his best mounts and what lessons he learned during his excellent career.
4,A Nice Introduction to the Subject,"For many modelers, taking the step from a kit model to kitbashing a kit is a big one. It can also be traumatic. These kits are not cheap and the idea of chopping one or more of them up to make something not covered by instructions is hard the first time. It is also worthwhile. This book is a nice introduction on the process.The approach is simple. Several projects are presented and the reader is instructed on specific steps to take in order to make something entirely new. Some of the projects are simpler than other ones but the ideas build upon each other.Much of this book is dated. It uses specific examples using specific kits from manufacturers. Some of the kits may not be available anymore but the ideas are easily transferable. Also, many of the kits featured are staples that have been around for a long time."
3,Microsof Bookshelf,"Notice that this product is advertised as Microsoft Bookshelf ""2000."" However when it arrived, it was Bookshelf 1998. I complained to the vendor who told me that the advertising on the Amazon site indicated that it was the 1998 version. I went back and did find fine print to that effect. I still feel this was a bait and switch transaction. In large letters in the product description are the words ""Microsoft Bookshelf 2000."" Then in fine print are the words ""Microsoft Bookshelf 1998 version."" What the vendor never addressed was why the words ""Bookshelf 2000"" ever appeared in the ad. I would not deal with this vendor again."
5,Great History of Southern Football,"I was captivated by this story. I am from Tuscaloosa, but until I read this book I never knew so much about the bond forged between Bear Bryant and Gene Stallings in the 1950s. This book captures the personality of Bear and reminds the readers what it takes to be successful in anything, not just football."
4,Made in Mexico!,"This is not the original Swiss Maggi Seasoning Sauce. It is very close and tastes fine, but be aware while the Trademark remains Swiss,this particular product is made and bottled in Mexico."
5,Please Start Selling Them Again,I bought a set of these several years ago. My only regret is that I didn't by more than two pairs. I literally use these on every project. The get a good gripping force and they are very handy.
2,Very Unrealistic!,"It's more like 1.5 stars. This book gives a general outline of the exam, but don't be fooled, the verbal reasoning on the actual exam is not as easy as the book. There are more complex questions. Also, the math section of the book is NOTHING like the exam; the exam has much more complex word problems. The questions for investigation portion of the book is probably the most accurate. Overall way too easy and unrealistic!"
2,Good start but not enough,"I would give it a 2.5 stars if I could, but I recently took the test and bought this book as a study guide. It gave me a good idea of what is expected on the test but then again, like the many reviews here, it just wasn't enough. I could have gotten the format of the test on the internet but it is a good practice. The information on the workbook is definitely easy and it should give you a boost of confidence. Once finished with the workbook, it should only take you several hours, purchase the Kaplan gre/gmat math workbook and solve all the word problems. That should quickly deflate your confidence. Now that you're back on Earth, continue to work ont he math workbook for about a week. For word section, this book should be sufficient. Remember to manage your time well during the test. I didn't feel so hot after I left the test but I still passed. Best of luck to everyone!"
3,Needs improvement,"The Treasury Enforcement Agent Exam book is not a bad start, but by no means a great start. I took the exam shortly after reading the book, and discovered that the questions were much more difficult on the actual test. Still, I was better prepared than if I had not read the book."
4,BETTER DETAILS,I WOULD OF LIKED TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PITCHING MACHINE LIKE SIZE WIEGHT IF IT HAS WHEELS TO MOVE AND BALL SPEED PITCH AND DISTANCE RECOMENDED FOR PITCHING ALSO WHAT TYPE OF WARRANTEE IS AVAILABLE STANDARD AND OR EXTENDED WARRANTE.
3,100th BSC book,"Kristy's Worst Idea is to break up the Baby-Sitters club. All the girls are busier and some of them have interpersonal conflicts, so they take a break. Of course, they all miss it and the parents in town go crazy, so of course, they get back together. Oops, did I spoil something?I just can't believe this is the hundreth book and they're all still 13 and in Eighth grade. I mean, come on. Also, this book takes place post-summer vacation, so shouldn't they be in 9th grade? Please? I started reading this series when I was in fourth grade. That was 1989. This book was published in 1996. Can they age a year?"
2,HTM enterprises toilet seat riser,"cheaply made, does not hold up to heavier disabled peoplewhat is the use of a riser if it can't hold weight and uses for which it was intended?.minute screws dont hold and plastic breaks easily.not very safe when your disabled elderly mother falls offbecause it breaks off the seat on the first use."
5,VERY INTERESTING,"GET INTO THE LIFE OF A WOMAN STRUGGLING WITH HER FAITH. GRACE'S LIFE IS PROOF THAT GOD LOVES US, NO MATTER WHAT WE HAVE DONE"
1,How about saving the script......,"Well I have seen this show, and what is so good about it? It really stinks. I see no good writing and I see that Hunter should have stayed with film acting because television really does nothing for her."
4,Glad to have it.,"I'm happy to find this CD and enjoy it much.However, her live recordings of her act are a little better but fans of Francis Faye will love this. Newcomers should give it a try too."
1,No Detail - Not aligned with MCSE exam,"The book is not worthy of the Exam Cram label. I have taken 7 certification tests. I always always read the exam cram for the test before I take it. Most of the time Exam Cram's are my primary study tool, and on a few test my only study tool (which is always a bad idea). This book however was the first of the 8 Exam Cram's i've read that didn't cover the points that the test hit. RRAS is a very important topic on this test, but the book doesn't cover it in the detail that the test warrants. I am overall disappointed in this title and will avoid this author in the future. As far as the Server and Professional Exam Cram's they are excellent very few typing errors and no technical errors that I picked up on. I do recommend those two for their corresponding exams.The air speed of an unladen swallow is not a topic covered in depth in any of the Exam Cram books.... To my disappointment."
1,Horrible...Horrible...Horrible,"Do not let the thinness of this book fool you. This exam requires indepth knowledge of Networking. This book does not touch on even half of what you need to know for the 70-216 exam. TCP/IP subnetting was brushed over by referring you to the TCP/IP ExamCram book. It doesn't touch on the detail you will need to pass this exam. It is TOO broad and does not go deep enough on anything. Unless you fully understand routing protocols down to the registry level, you're better off getting a ""real"" study guide of your choice.I love ExamCram books, but my experience has been that about 1 out of 3 of the books are just plain horrible! WHY do they do this? WHY do they rush to publish a book that is just so bad?"
2,Not that great,I bought this based on the above reviews but I found it's not that great if you don't watch TV and know these characters. My two year old who was just starting with potty training was very bored with the book. It seems to go on and on. Perhaps it is for older kids than my two year old.
1,All is not natural?,"I wish I would not have spent a hard earned 20.00 on this. It says All-Natural on the box, but look at the ingredients and they are: all natural laundry soda (i assume they mean sodium carbonate), sodium silicate and COCONUT OIL BASED DETERGENT. I have found that when the words ""based detergent"" are used it is a synthetic chemical of some sort. If it were to say ""coconut oil soap"", it would make me less wary of what is in it. I have e-mailed them and they won't say exactly what chemical it is. Thier MSDS sheet says proprietary ingredients so it is a secret I can live without. A complete waste of money if you want to be sure it is All-Natural, I sure wouldn't take their word for it. This is a very misleading product."
3,A good review of the beginnings of the second world was...but tedious on occasion,"In this first volume, Churchill vividly describes the fateful years of Hitler's rise to power and outlines how the debacle of the ending of the first world war allowed Hitler to come to power. However, I give the book only three stars as I found some of the reading very tedious with respect to all the letters and speeches he gave and,thus, printed here. Many of the letters he wrote to various statesmen I found a bit boring, although, some readers may find them fascinating. Several of his letters are quite remarkable with his predictions as to what will happen in the years to come. Secondly, with his exceptional command of British English and sentence structure, I found the reading, sometimes, a bit laborious. Just keep in mind that, I think, British English and proper sentence structure read differently than American English. In saying that though, I plan on finishing the remaining five volumes."
3,"Good Interview, but where was the band?","I enjoyed watching this video. While Don Brewer was not one of my favorite drummers, I did enjoy his playing with Grand Funk. He was well suited to the high energy style of that band. My only real difficulty with the video was that I expected to see Don play with a band and maybe in some other musical settings beyond tapes of Grand Funk.He did some great playing behind Pete Seager. Why not include some of that? If you want to hear Don talk about playing with Grand Funk watch him play along with recorded music, get this. But be prepared. Don't look for the band."
2,I wanted to like this book,"I love the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series and was really excited about a book about vampires that would tie me over until the new installment came out. This was not it. Poorly written and at times embarrassing, I only finished this book out of stubborness. His eyes were alway ""molten mercury"" and there was no rhyme or reason to the powers that her characters possessed."
4,Good book,I have loved every one of the Carpathian books. In dark magic I love how Savannah is always messing with Gregori.
5,Excellent!,"I was so glad to see Gregori find happiness! I love these stories, although the male chauvinist stuff gets a bit trying. But this is the culture Feehan has created for the Carpathians. If they were completely perfect in all ways it surely would be just too much to swallow, right? In Dark Challenge I saw the beginnings of enlightenment, so I have hope even for the Carpathian male. : )"
4,a 'MUST READ' !!,"The Dark and Imposing Gregori is seen as one that is untouchable and undefeatable by many. In this book, its very heartwarming to see how he is trying to open up to Savannah , his lifemate as well as the offspring of his prince, Mikhail and Raven.This is a total page turner as i was kept busy with the book all afternoon.A bit of a feminist and dreamer, its nice to see how a hard and unforgiving character like Geogori goes all out of his way to keep Savannah safe and agree to go with her whims. Savannah does help Geogori to ease his guilt that he may have manipulated with Fate in order to get a lifemate."
4,Courage,"If the proof is in the pudding, the value of this recipe is that I have faced three concrete 'CEO moments' since finishing Lencioni's fable two days ago that have proven to be the turf for implementation of his well-told counsel to CEOs who live or die by clarity and courage.Courage. The author understands that life at the top of an organization calls for extraordinary bravery as one faces the limitations of oneself and then of others. He does not let his reader off the hook, but presses into him the need for firm resolve and courageous action in resisting the temptations that come-one at a time or in fearsome mobs-into the life of the CEO.This is my second Lencioni fable (after Four Obsessions) and the best of the two.If you, like me, find your finite reservoir of courage in ample demand as you attempt to lead human beings to succeed in a group, success begins with our will to summon up that quality yet one more time. Reading this book will help you find the moral courage to do so."
4,Good for Any Leader,"Despite the title, this business fable by Lencioni is written for any type of leader. The book challenges the reader to undergo a self-assessment of one's own growth areas. A central theme of the book is that true courage is the ability to accept the responsibility of your own failures in leadership and make the necessary adjustments.In a nutshell, to overcome the five temptations of a CEO:Choose results over status,choose accountability over popularity,choose clarity over certainty,choose constructive conflict over harmony, andchoose trust over invulnerability.By way of criticism, there is a feeling that Lencioni's fables are beginning to become a bit too formulaic. Reading the full text takes less than 2 hours, and one wonders if this would have made a better magazine article than a book. Nevertheless, I have worked for enough poor leaders-and occasionally, been one-to know the value of these lessons."
1,Why can't I give a 0 star ?,"This is the crapiest anti-motivational book I ever got to read.It is a story of Andrew who is a CEO and who meets with an old man one night in the train. The old man is a janitor and his father was a CEO (whatever)so the janitor, CEO's son (Gosh)startsmentoring Andrew on how he should run his company.If this janitor was smart enough to motivate a CEO how come heended up being a janitor in the first place?!?I thought, to be a writer you have to be born as a writer but only now I realized that anyone can be a writer and PatrickLencioni is the worst one from the ones I've read.Am I just being paranoid or is the today's literature followingtoday's music fate ?!?"
4,Insightful!,"Why do CEOs fail? According to Patrick Lencioni, they fall prey to common temptations that distract them from their only true responsibility: producing results. The temptations, like the tendency to focus on career status over corporate performance, boil down to very human weaknesses. You won't necessarily learn any real success secrets here, but the reminder to keep these dangerous propensities in mind and under control will be valuable to all executives. This book has gotten rave reviews for its powerful simplicity and vivid prose, but we think the slim volume would have been more effective if it were made even slimmer by cutting out the fable that frames the CEO advice. But nevertheless, we [...] recommend this book as fast and easy reading for CEOs or, likelier, for those still climbing the corporate ladder."
5,A million uses,"When a company puts messages in a public space, it's called advertising. When a citizen leaves a message in a public space, it's called vandalism.And the retractable point is something we've all yearned for, if inchoately, for years."
2,no good rct book,"I was very disappointed with this review book. The multiple choice questions were not worded well, for example, "" Which one of these does not belong?"" What are we doing to our special ed kids? Write straightforward questions that test knowledge not how someone can be tricked!"
2,Not her best Cynster novel,"Like all books by Laurens, this one has good use of language and beautiful settings. However, this is definitely the weakest plot of her Cynster series. There is no tension between the male and female protagonists - their relationship is so predictable and comfortable that it becomes boring within the first third of the book. The only mild tension in the story is a conspiracy that is made obvious to the reader early on. I am a longtime fan of Laurens, including several earlier Cynster novels, but this series is definitely played out. My advice to other fans - don't buy this one; get it from the library."
5,Surprisingly UNLIKE Laurens Other Novels--A Definite Keeper,"I have to say--having read everything by Laurens so far, and at times getting a bit bored with the repeat plot-lines--this was a breath of fresh air. I was expecting the same story, different verse, but this story was much more. The mystery was truly and FINALLY engaging! I was debating up until the last few pages as to WHO the villian(s) could be and when the mystery was solved, I was blown away! The hero's artistic side also shown through in the way he viewed the heroine. Most of all, I loved the fact that in this story neither party was pretending that they DID NOT want a relationship. So many of Laurens stories revolve around one or both lead characters fighting to NOT get involved, whereas this story was all about love and passion between two people who had real chemistry and were not afraid to show it. A definite keeper!!!"
1,Something has gone awry,"I usually love Laurens' books, but this one is completely different than her others, both in style and believability. The premise is so ludicrous, I couldn't believe I was actually supposed to buy it for one minute. The style of writing is also weighed down heavily with way too much detail. If I didn't know better, I'd say someone else wrote this book because it has nothing to offer, contrary to her usual fare. Save your money and buy an earlier title instead."
3,Not quite up to the rest of the Cynsters,"This book was fun, but it's just not the ""read-it-again"" excapist Regency romp the earlier books in the series are."
2,Amazon Product Information not adequate,The product was advertised as MS Office 2000 Professional (old edition). It failed to mention that it was OEM software which must remain with the PC it was purchased for. I am guessing they meant to put (OEM Version) on the description. I had every reason to expect I was buying a retail package. This software transaction was illegal.
4,Great with a cup of anachronism,"A continuation of the Meg Langslow series, ""Revenge of the Wrought-Iron Flamingos"" is another delightful read. Donna Andrews describes things so vividly that you can imagine what things are like in some of the Civil War reenactment camps. The characters are certainly characters! You can usually name someone you know who reminds you of each one in some way; the mischievous brother, the officious organizer, the gossipy family etc. I always look forward to the next book in the series upon completing a Meg Langslow story."
1,disappointing,"Penczak provides good information on shamamism in the first chapter, so he clearly did some research, but failed to provide much of substance about shamanic practices. He makes statements that were nonsensical, and probably unintentionally hilarious - like how shamans in Second Attention (which is not explained) can be found studying sand or walking backward. This was clearly written to be a serious statement of shamanic mindset, but instead simply sounded absurd. He also lifted and included entire segments from his previous books (inner temple meditation, alpha countdown) as well as rehashing casting a circle. It felt like filler to create enough material for this book, so that he could keep the series going. Disappointing, given how good his first book was."
5,Excellent,"Use it for live spoken word mic/PA and MP3 recording. Easy to set up and use. Eliminates pops and source volume variation (mumblers), redux on audience and background noise. Great value."
3,Talked me out of the vending business,I was curious about the vending business and so I got this book. It ended up letting me know that I wouldn't really enjoy it.
5,Practical Advice for tarting a Vending biz,If you're thinking about starting a vending business and need to know how the pros work the biz this book is for you. If you r an experienced veteran and want some validation on your best practices and principles this book is for you. If you are just looking into starting a vending business and have no vending machines and no stake in the game this book might turn you off to the vending industry before you even try you hand at the vending business.
2,repetitive production,"Every beat has the same tempo, with the same sounding snare. Slug's flows are always good, but it's like listening to the same song fifteen times in a row."
5,Amazing Read,"This was one of the most amazing stories I've read of WWII. The bravery and sacrifices made by the men during this battle is incredible. Having only learned of my father's experiences in WWII as a Marine following his passing, I've read as many books as I can about the Marines in the Pacific. This is easily one of the best written. It's told from the view of the Marines who fought for what seemed like 24 hours a day for over a month. Most Americans know the story of the flag raising but that was long before the battle ended. As was my father, these were ordinary men who did extraodinary things to defeat the enemy on this piece of rock near the Japanese mainland.I recently visited the Marine Corp museum where the actual flag raised on Iwo Jima is on display. This was very emotional having read about what these men accomplished and sacrificed. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning what real heroes are all about."
2,Book material dated,"While some of Mr. Houlub's discussions of Java threading are interesting on their own right, the introduction of Java 5 renders some of the contents out-dated. Since the author's code library discussed within the book is not open sourced, coders cannot use the contents of this book directly."
4,He kept that train from sliding down the mountain!,"This is another Tibor Gergely classic and another favorite from my own childhood. The illustrations here are not as good as those Mr. Gergely supplied for Scuffy the Tugboat or Seven Little Postmen (and neither is the prose, this time care of Marian Potter). However, my two-year-old son loves the book, demanding that I read it to him nearly every evening. He likes the various images of the train which are also brimming with incidental details: countless children and animals, mountain climbers, boats, school busses, carriages, kites, bridges, produce stands, and castles, just to name a few. Sometimes, he will ""read"" the book himself. Because the prose is simple and repetetive, he is easily able to remember and recount portions of the text. Of course, the book also teaches a good lesson about being useful, as most train storybooks seem to do (e.g., Thomas, Tootle, The Little Engine That Could)."
2,"It May Be a Classic, but Beware of Racism","I wanted to like this cute little book, but unfortunately I wasn't able to share it with my toddlers. It may be appropriate when they are older and we can discuss stereotypes, but they're too young now. The book depicts this adorable little caboose traveling through a variety of towns and cities. One page shows the caboose passing a group of Native Americans living in teepees, dressed in stereotypical clothing. It simply doesn't fit with the values I want to share with my children. Just like I won't watch the racist version of Song of the South with my kids, I won't read this book. It may have been acceptable in the era in which this book was written, but it's no longer appropriate. I think it's important that parents/caregivers who may be thinking of purchasing this book know this prior to buying it. I would appreciate such information. It's one of the problems with buying books written long ago."
5,A thrilling ride through the world of medical research!,Howard Simon gets it right the first time! He captivates the reader with this ultra-realistic account of animal rights activists gone mad. The characters are well defined and the action keeps you turning the pages hour after hour. I've read this book several times and it got better every time I read it.
3,Not Bad...,"I recently bought this movie because I was looking for something more offbeat and bizarre to watch, and usually Terry Gilliam's films hit bizarre right on. Don't get me wrong, this movie is definitely bizarre, but it is also quite corny as well. After watching it, it's obvious that this movie was made for a younger audience. However even though it wasn't what I expected I still enjoyed the fantasy involved in the world(s) Terry Gilliam set the film in."
3,Strange but interesting,I first saw Time Bandits when I was just a kid. I thought it was the coolest movie ever. So in a fit of nostalgia I bought the movie when I found it at Amazon. While I still enjoyed it I had forgotten how strange it was and that it had no real ending. It's like the movie just stops with none of your questions answered. Other than that it is an entertaining movie with several very good actors. I do recommend this movie for a night at home with some friends. Just make sure they all have good imaginations or you will do a lot of explaining.
5,Funny first time through.,"I haven't seen this movie in years. I remeber watching it as a young child and I absolutely loved it. If only most movies were as imaginitive as this one. Highly recommended for anyone: Families, children, adults. I can't wait to watch it again on DVD."
3,"rather disappointing, but has its moments","For what it's worth, this is kid slapstick sci-fi. My son (10) was definitely able to go with it and found a lot of the antics very funny. Unfortunately, I simply wasn't able to let myself believe for the time that I watched it, but instead looked at it as a canned set piece made up by someone.That being said, there are lots of Gilliam adds in many details that makes this special and worth seeing. My son and I laughed at the way the giant scraped his enormous posterior on the ground. THe character cameos are also hilarious, from Sean Connery as the blithely doomed Agamemnon to Iain Holm's self-obsessed Napoleon.However, I doubt this will become a favorite in our household. Recommended."
3,TIME BANDITS,"IF YOU LIKED THE MOVIE MANY MANY YEARS AGO, THEN IT'S GOOD TO HAVE. I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S CHEESY BUT MY HUSBAND LOVES IT..."
1,Another Gilliam Directorial Crapfest...,"Time Bandits is awful. As awful as Jabberwocky if you can believe it.The only post-Python Gilliam-directed film I can recommend is 12 Monkeys. In films like Brazil and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Gilliam hits us with crazy visuals...acid trips and fantasies...that go on and on and on until the credits roll. No plot, no involvement, no point at all.If you've ever seen Lost in La Mancha, you were probably saddened by all the events that led to the cancellation of Gilliam's Don Quixote film...from the lead actor breaking bones, to a flood that destroyed expensive equipment. But after seeing some of Gilliam's other films, I'm now convinced that those events were:""A blessing! A blessing from the Lord! God be praised!"""
4,Classic Movie,Bought it because it was a classic that my husband loves. I personally didn't like it. The story is good. The actors are good. The costumes and set SUCK. I totally dogged the movie and made my husband sour about it for days.
1,Child movie Total waste of time if you are not 5 years old!,"Goo-goo, boo-boo. If those words seem ""extremely"" intelligent to you or you actually can translate them, then believe the high ratings, and this movie is for you."
2,Ok movie,"The movie was ok, but kind of confusing at times and too long. The time travel was interesting, especially when the Bandits ended up on a sinking Titanic!"
4,I Like Weird Movies!.,"I first saw Time Bandits on cable, I think it was on one of those premium movie channels like HBO, Cinemax or Showtime. I have read some negetive reviews by people who said they hated this movie because it was too weird but what they hate about this movie is exactly why I like it. I like weird movies aand I really enjoyed watching Time and its which is the first fantansy movie I rememer watching and I highly recommend it!"
4,Forgotten Favorite,"I hadn't seen this in a while but I wasn't disappointed.This film revolves around Kevin, a boy who finds himself accidently brought along on a robbery spree with some rather dimunitive chaps who work for the Supreme Being. Armed with a map which shows where time holes are located at through history they manage to jump from one situation to another. Meanwhile, Evil finds out they have the map and plots to get it for himself.A wonderful movie and if you've never seen it you really should."
4,"Not the best Python, but no Python actor can be bad.","The wide screen makes this a wonderful movie to see.There's tons of excitement, laughable history lessons, fantastic filming, loveable characters, tons of good child geared humor... but adults will love it, too.It's not standard for some of what the Pythons did, but it's still better than many other movies out there.All-in-all, it's awesome and worth owning. Get it!"
3,Why not put the whole concert out?,22 Minutes?Why not release the whole show featuring The Beatles.The Beach Boys and Leslie Gore?It would make a good document of the times.
2,"Beach Boys Rock, a little","This is only for completists. If you have every Beach Boys CD, and the three other great DVD's, you can buy this. It is only 20 minutes, one concert with about 50 fans, March 1964. It is post Beatles, and all still have their greaser hairdo's. (By September of 1964 Dennis has full Beatle bangs, Al and Carl are sporting Dave Clark type bangs to the side, and Brian is kind of hanging his pompadour low.) Contray to another review, Brian does look like he's enjoying it, and this is far from his last concert. They sing great, the sound is ok, but as I've said, you have to really want to see it to pay this much for 20 minutes."
4,Worked for me,"Read this book once and passed the Exam. There are portions of the exam that are not covered in this book, but the bulk of them are. If you do not work with the product or are just now trying to break into the IT field you will need more info than is provided. If you are just renewing your MCSE and know NT4 pretty well, this coupled with some of the white papers are all you will need."
4,Excellent book!,"I was suprised at how great this book actually is. I have MCSD and MCDBA certs and am now going for MCSE 2000. I have used Exam Crams for every exam I passed. This one was by far the best! The practice exam questions were very close to those on the actual exam, which is rare in an Exam Cram book. I agree however with a fellow reviewer, more RIS coverage would have made it complete. Overall the book was well organized and the authors created excellent review questions. Great job!"
5,Jeff Waters is a f&*king stud!,"Admittedly, Annihilator is buried in several cheesy 80's metal cliches (corny lyrics, not so great singers, album covers w/horns devils) but the musicianship of Annihilator is superior to many ""popular"" bands today. ""I Am In Command"" shows the metal-ness of this band along with the superior track ""Refresh the Demon"" (the drummer is amazing). ""Crystal Ann"" and ""Alison Hell"" shows just how dynamic this band can sound. I'm also amazed at the sound quality and the tightness of them live. Highly recommended!"
5,stop walking on eggshells,"I found the book extreamly helpfull. The many examples were a great help in identifying the type behavior exhibited, and the methods to deal with them."
1,Cruelly Insensitive,This is a truly cruel and insensitive book written by an individual who doesn't really understand the pathology of BPD. Throw this book in the trash if you actually care about someone with BPD.
2,Vague Inconclusive,"At the start the book disqualifies itself as a source for diagnosis, while pointing out how nobody in his profession even agrees that the condition even exists (Borderline Personality Disorder). The main question this book raises with me is, ""How could I or anybody know if some person (or myself) is afflicted by this condition. Just about anyone I know, including myself qualifies after all I Have read."
3,Good Real Life Examples But With A Lot of Redundancy,"Having a parent with BPD, it was comforting to read the stories of other children and parents coping with similar issues in the examples offered by the authors. However, I found the authors efforts to analyze these real world examples to be overly simplistic. I would still recommend this book to others who have family members with BPD, because of the isolating nature of this disorder."
2,Boring Book.,This book has too many scenarios and not enough information from the writer re: factual information that would have been useful.
5,Required to understand a common undiagnosed mental illness.,"I agree with the reviewer below, I don't know how Randi Kreger and Paul Mason achieved such a lucid masterpiece of savvy compassion for both BPs and anyone sadly taking undiagnosed or untreated BPD for sanity. Good companion films while digesting this book and placing tricky BPD in proper perspective include The Cable Guy, Our Mother's Murder, Psycho, The Exorcist, and Fatal Attraction, along with accounts of such real life BPD personalities as Tom Capano, O.J. Simpson, and Brit Hartman. Many blessings to all ""non-BPDs"" who have found their way to this sobering book while making hard decisions and taking their life back. Buy it, and visit Randi Kreger's site."
5,A strategy to take back your sanity,"The descriptions and prescriptions offered in this book resonate very well with my 40-year relationship with a close friend who, according to the criteria in Eggshells, clearly has the Borderline personality. It took me until I read this book to be convinced of this diagnosis and response plan. The most important contributions of this book lie in its strategies to avoid being overwhelmed, depressed and devalued by the neediness, anger and paranoia of your BP friend, while at the same time to shape the BP back into higher level of functioning. This book is a lifesaver!"
1,This woman has no business giving health advice,"There are a number of things wrong with this book, but the most glaring are her attempts at advising parents on the health of their child. She gets a lot of things wrong and gives some scary-bad advice.She also takes a really narrow and negative approach toward fathers. One would think if you're enlightened enough to be doing yoga, you'd be enlightened enough to find a mate who participates in childcare without needing to be wheedled and cajoled into it.Save your money on this one."
1,Not a fan,I can't seem to get my daughter interested in this book. My husband said it was the worst one ever. It is pretty pointless and a dull read. So I'm sure OUR lack of enthusiasm for the book doesn't help!
4,The worlds biggest cover up,"This is the movie to get if you love Conspracies and Hoaxes.It is about a Plot by Para government agencies to dupe the American people and Keep space program funding by filming a fake NASA mission to mars,then they try to terminate anybody who could expose the truth.The movie is the inovator of sinister ''Black helicopters'' and the SECRET GOVERNMENT guys. Elaborate media hoaxes,disinformation and far reaching conspiracies that have the power to make people dissapear are all in here. One of the first films to bring up how people could be manipulated by the pseudo reality of TV.I am not saying that this kind of thing happens but it is interesting from the perspective of Folklore.BLUE THUNDER another film about scary helicopters is a similiar film and equaly unique."
4,Excellent,"I do not discuss plots with movies. Better to not ruin things and let people watch without knowing what is going to happen.But this is a 4, maybe 5 star must have. Great acting. Great story.A plus for any DVD collection."
3,Silly but very entertaining.,"Capricorn One is a silly but also very entertaining movie.When I saw this at the movies,the audience groaned at the implausible scene of a man hanging on to wires as a biplane goes into huge dives and twists-he must have been Superman!Also,how do the astronauts go to Mars(a two year round trip)in a vehicle designed for a moon trip of two weeks?How does the reporter drive straight to the warehouse containing the fake Mars landing and how come the conspirators didn't hide the evidence?They just leave it there.Perhaps this was just the film-makers way of saying don't take this premise too seriously.After all,some naive people actually think that there wasn't a moon landing,but then some think that Elvis is alive too.The film is still very entertaining and watch out for the fake painted cardboard TV camera which gets accidently bumped at the end of the film."
3,Funky Sci-Fi!,"What a great flick. Elliot Gould looking his 70's best. Pre-trial OJ being a hero. Amazing! The premise of the movie is a little off, though. I mean, if the astronauts who never went to the moon kept quiet, certainly these guys who never went to Mars would too, right?If you're into 70's cheesey Sci-Fi, this is the movie for you! Get Hangar 18 and make it a double feature!"
3,Must be a mix-up!,"Wide Screen's review of this DVD must belong to ""Highlander"" and then it would be too generous. The picture and sound on this DVD actually are quite good. My laser copy is pan-and-scan, so it makes a big difference seeing this film in the 2:35 aspect ratio. The sound is listed as Dolby 5.1 and is more than adequate for a film of its age."
2,"Happy with most features, expensive handsets all but dead after 4 years","Two years ago, I bought this phone system with 4 additional handsets. I have some minor complaints on features, but overall the system suits the needs of my home-based business. For a while, I was very satisfied, but then just a little more than a year after I made the purchase, the handsets started to lose contact with the base, often in mid-call. I bought third-party batteries once to save $$, but they didn't resolve the problem so I sprung for the AT&T; batteries. Same problem. This system was way too expensive to have to replace so soon. It's a shame - once upon a time, the AT&T; brand guaranteed an excellent product, but next time I'll look for another brand.ADDENDUM, OCTOBER 2011: Three of the four handsets are dead (despite battery replacements). These were expensive and I am disgusted."
2,Unprofessional Outgoing Message Quatlity,Have to return this phone even though I love the features and look. The quality of the outgoing message on the answering system is horrible. I need a more professional sounding greeting. Speakerphone sound is also weak. All this may be ok for regular home use but not for a home office or business use where sound quality matters.
3,AT&T EP5962 2 line corded/cordless phone,"This phone had all the features I was looking for and the price was good. Unfortunately, it is an older model with no support from AT&T. The unit received was defective - the handset would not charge in charger. I would like to have exchanged it but that was not an option - I had to return it. I have decided to purchase a newer model."
1,Yawn,Boring. I've purchased other Masque slots game that I enjoy. This one (all of the games on this DVD) were just plain boring.
2,traditional slots,This program lacks the fun penny machines with bonus features. It's mostly the plain boring games. It's good at teaching you that the bank always comes out ahead.
1,Poor graphics and boring slots,"Most of the slots are a total bore. There are a few interactive games but even playing for a long time doesn't bring up the bonus features much. If I play without money I want to at least have fun. I previously bought Pogo's Casino Island to go which is a lot more fun with beautiful graphics and the slots have lots of bonus features. The high minimums make it a little unbelievable but after all it's a game, right?"
2,Painful,"I am a big Artie fan. I loved his It's the Whiskey Talkin' dvd and his book, Too Fat Too Fish. Those were great, you got the feeling he really enjoyed doing both. This, well, it's old tired material, and it looks like he is battling depresion and urges to use drugs the entire time. He is way off here. It's too bad, Artie is a talented guy when he has his act together."
5,JWin DVD player is a real winner!,"Jwin Jdvd141 Compact, 2-Channel Progressive Scan Dvd PlayerI have found the JWin DVD-141 to be a video-playing workhorse. I was so impressed with it's reliability that I bought a second one for my other TV. It's so very reasonable, simple to install and extremely easy to use. The only thing I can think of that's at all negative is the remote must be aimed exactly at the player for it to work. I highly recommend this for anyone needing a no-frills DVD player."
3,kingdom heart's theme song,"Hikaru Utada is a great singer, in my opinion. Hikari is most known as the kingdom heart's theme song. but actually, te song is a slow song. The cd has remixes and the original version. there are 4 tracks to the cd. It's a good cd, but all the songs sound the same to me."
5,A timeless tale from the depths of an unhappy life in Japan to the hot pursuit of an aging ghost and an overall remarkable story,"Autumn Shadows In August by Robert W. Norris is an engaging and entertaining novel about David Thompson, an American teaching at a Japanese University and his dealing with hepatitis C. As Thompson an his wife realize the significance of their lives and what they've entirely done, Autumn Shadows In August begins its story through the retracing of a once young man's journey through Europe from Germany to Rome, replete with intriguing twists and adventurous intricacies. Autumn Shadows In August is very strongly recommended for all general fiction readers for its evocative telling and unique style and presentation of a timeless tale from the depths of an unhappy life in Japan to the hot pursuit of an aging ghost and an overall remarkable story."
3,Not supportive at all...,"This is very pretty, but if you're DD then forget this for any type of support - I'll be sending it back. I also ordered Playtex Women's 18 Hour Seamless Smoothing #4049, which seems pretty good (wearing it for the first time today, so I don't know how long lasting it is). My favorite is Moving Comfort Women's Maia - but that is for working out, so you can't wear any type of scoop neck."
5,My Partner Loves them,These are the second set she is wearing. She loves them even more than before. They give her great support and her boobs looks better when she is dressed...I Love them too....they look great on her.Will but again!
2,Odd Shape,"Pros:ComfortableVery SupportiveNice Lace(Can't comment on durability - I returned it)Cons:SHAPEI found this bra to give my breasts a very bizarre shape. Not cone or bullet shaped, but definitely too perky- my breasts pointed up. If you look closely you can actually see the shape on the model in the picture. I didn't notice until I tried it on myself but then I looked back at the picture and sure enough - they point up. I think everyone has a different idea of an appropriate breast shape so my advice is to look very carefully at the picture being mindful of the shape- if it looks good to you then you might like it. It is also possible that with bigger breasts the extra gravity might balance out the extra lift and make a nice shape. (I am a 40D)"
3,"I'll give it 3 stars, too. It's not New York.","It certainly isn't the group in NYC. I hope I can like it as much. There will never be another Ryan. Phillip might be, kind of, a cross between Ryan and TJ. Of course, obviously, James is the Austin, and Levi is the Reichen, but not hot. And I see Chase as being the 'Derek'.I'll just have to wait and see. I know it's just been only one episode. I just wish there was more of a difference in ages. I felt like Mike was an anchor. And I liked that Reichen was a bit older, too. And somewhat masculine. I think Taylor might just be the Nyasha of the bunch...thinking that the party shouldn't start before he arrives.Anyway, I'll give it a chance. I just miss Ryan, and Derek, though. And,of course...TJ, too."
4,WASP Without the Smirk.,"The Headless Children is without a doubt the best album WASP ever produced. The most ironic part of this is that all the humor was gone. One of the things that had drawn me to the band, their sharp stick in the eye humor was long forgotten here.The original album kicks off with Heretic (The Lost Child) a black tale of life in LA street gangs and that sets the tone for the whole record from Forever Free to Mean MAn. You just couldn't miss that Blackie and Co. were pissed and meant business here.Let me close be putting this record into perspective by saying, that on a hot summer night in August years ago the songs on this record almost caused riot in a small club in Boston. It was without a doubt one of the most intense shows I've ever scene and I've almost 200."
2,Don't Bother,"I have been trading professionally for over 10 years. I have done very well in the markets after a long learning curve. The ideas in this book have a slight chance to work, but you'd be better off fliping a coin than using his entry methods. I was on the floor and everyone knows about these ideas. Everything in here needs a tight stop."
3,Cheap alternative,"It is a Canon, even big Nikon letter on it. I think black and yellow is Nikon's color and Grey/red is Canon. I bet you can find the exact same product with Canon on it, after all, Canon sales more camera than Nikon."
3,Average Strap,"This strap is just average for comfort, it has no real stretch or shock absorbing qualities, and the suede back becomes very slippery when sweat-soaked. The finished edges are still a little rough, but for the price it's still a fairly good deal, if you want to pay money to be a walking billboard.The problem with camera-branded straps is that the name on the strap is a giant advertisement of your equipment, which for all real intents and purposes screams ""steal me!"" since that's what grab-and-go camera thieves look for. It's better to buy a good quality aftermarket sling without a big bright logo on it, and cover over the name on your camera with a small peice of gaffer's tape. Most non-camera branded straps are built with more comfort in mind as well."
4,A forgotten time,"I was lucky enough to acquire both the Vinyl edition and original UK CD release of this recording in the '80s. Timing has a lot to do with one's ability to enjoy this soundtrack because your association to the end of the cold war will influence that judgment. This is NOT a Pink Floyd recording on side 2. It is a Bleeding Heart band recording of the RADIO KAOS era. I was, and still am, a huge fan of this recording. The musicianship and performance characteristics are stellar. The production, using what was at that time state of the art, is great. Roger did have something important to say about the fear of death in a increasingly tense stand off between the USSR and NATO. If you weren't alive or cognizant of those times this recording is hard to enjoy. While opaque drug induced lyrics make bong hits all the better, this is a very political statement which lacks the subtlety of such recordings of the Pink Floyd era."
3,"Good, if a little light.","This is a good book for a day when you just want to enjoy yoursef.The setting is intersenting and mixed with the characters that are involved, make it an entertaining book. The author does a good job of keeping alot of things going on at the same time, like Clancy, but not as involved. He should give a little more depth to some of the less known characters.Good book."
3,"Too much ""plot"" between action sequences.","Although many of the other reader reviews were very positive about this work, I found it less than riveting.It was very well written, but I much prefer reading a book of this genre which spends the majority of its time on engagements between adversaries, rather than winding us through geopolitical twists and turns which are purely hypothetical anyway.I also have little use in this genre for what seems to be the obligatory love stories. They do little or nothing to advance the plot, and they don't make me ""care"" about the characters anymore than I otherwise might. A little of this stuff goes a long way, and the author lays it on thick.My final word is that I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading Dark Wing, but I sure wouldn't highly recommend it either."
1,Nothing about Geneva - Very Dissapointed,"This is the first Rick Steves travel book I have purchased, and I am very dissapointed. Several friends who travel frequently highly reccomended Rick Steves so I purchased this book without looking into it carefully. I am planning a trip to Geneva and was shocked to discover that there is nothing about Geneva in this book. It isn't even listed in the Index and in the chapter on Lake Geneva the only mention is ""Skip the big, dull city of Geneva"". How can he call this a guide to Switzerland without anything at all about a major city? To be fair, his generic advice about packing, language guides are fine but they can be found in any guidebook and I found the advertsing for his luggage and tours annoying. I will not have time to travel beyond Geneva so I can not judge his advice for other areas of the country, but for me this book is basically useless."
4,Not recently updated,"I travel exclusively with Rick Steve's books and they have never let me down. However, the more famous Rick becomes the more aged his books seem to get. This one no longer even has the date on it so it is not updated as often as his other books. Still the best European travel books around if you travel solo."
2,Switzerland Planning,"As with all Rick Steve's guides, this one has a wealth of information on Switzerland. I was very disappointed, however, to find that the second largest city in the country, Geneva, was not mentioned. I expected the ususal comprehesnive coverage of this city and found - nothing! Very disappointing since Geneva will be the site of the conference I will be attending and the hub for our travels in the country."
1,I loved this movie years ago.,I hate that I can't buy it to play in the US. I would buy it in a minute if I could play it!
5,Who cares about Seabiscuit ????,"All these reviews referring to Seabiscuit - let me tell you it was AMERICANS who killed Phar Lap and don't imagine that Australians will ever forget it.This is the TRUE story, not only of what was probably the worlds greatest EVER race horse, but also of the way a nation was forged. For everything and everyone the rest of the world rejects as worthless, Australia and Australians know this is the very seed of all things awesome!Watch this and learn something valuable to the world in it's present crisis!"
1,Would Have Been Nice If We Could Have Actually Watched It,"A friend of mine bought this for me as a gift. She said it's absolutely hilarious. But here's the problem. She bought it used, from an Amazon reseller, and when I went to play it I got an error message saying ""Wrong Region."" What does THAT mean???? I live in Arizona, and it came from an Amazon seller in New Jersey.Needless to say I am EXTREMELY disappointed. I like Eric Idol, and I've heard this is a very funny movie. But if you live in Arizona I guess you're just out of luck. All I got was a DVD that I can't play. :-("
3,"Solid biography, but nothing splendid","Solberg offers a well-researched and fair biography of one of America's greatest Senators this century and a former Vice President. From his pharmacy days till his death we get the full view of Humphrey's life. Maybe of more interest to history buffs than the average person, this is still well worth a read if you can track down a copy."
2,Why is Halloween ALWAYS on a Friday in books?,"It probably did do Claudia some good to stay back, but my big annoyance was that Halloween always seems to be on a Friday in books, television, etc. That seemed to so rarely happen when I was dress up for Halloween age."
3,May be too scary for toddlers,"I just wanted to say my 2-year-old son is an Elmo fanatic ... however, he and I only watched this video together once. I thought he enjoyed it because he seemed so transfixed. However ... ever since he screams in terror if I so much as show him the DVD box! I recommend parents rent this video first and make sure their kids truly enjoy it before making a purchase."
3,My three year old son thinks it is too scary,"Well, this is cute. I like it. But my three year old son (who normally likes Elmo and who normally like Halloween) is scared to watch it. He doesn't want me to play it--he asks for Dora's Halloween instead.This DVD--compared to other Elmo DVD's--is a tad on the dark side, with a Haunted House and spooky sounds. So while it is of course tame for us grown-ups, you may want to be careful if you think your child might be frightened.I hope this helps you make your decision!"
2,Wrong description,"The product description is wrong, the featured languages mentioned are English and Spanish but the DVD comes only in English."
2,Don't read if you're looking for current or accurate scientific data,"While reading how others have coped with illnesses can be encouraging, especially for the new patient, this book is definitely not your source for the best, most accurate, up to date information on this topic. Though the illness termed ""CFS"" is mysterious, lacks diagnostic tests and a true treatment protocol, the organic, neurological illness M.E. has none of those problems. It is not mysterious, it is the same in every patient, there are a variety of diagnostic tests that can accurately and reliably identify M.E. patients, and are there are some specific medications and coping techniques that can help. If you want to learn about the real illness M.E. you'll have to look for a book by Dr. Byron Hyde."
3,Expensive for what you actually get.,"This was a good book with some helpful ideas. I'm sorry to say though it was mostly old news, and fairly expensive ($... for 64 pages with few new ideas.)"
5,Lovely Movie,"This sweet romantic movie is a favorite of many and perhaps Woody Allen's best film. Mia Farrow is perfect as sweet Cecilia who really deserves a handsome hero in her life, Jeff Daniels is great in his duel road and Danny Aiello plays a villain with enough charm that you can see why Cecilia got involved with him in the first place. The 1930's setting is well realized and nostalgic. And the movie within a movie is fantastic since as others have said Allen somehow makes the black and white fantasy world brighter and more appealing then the drab reality."
4,"""You can't learn to be real. It's like learning to be a midget.""","Not quite a great film, per se, but still just about perfect movie.A square-jawed explorer in a 1930s studio comedy becomes smitten with a woman in the audience and magically steps off the screen to meet her. This sparks problems for the other characters, for the theater owner and his patrons, for the up-and-coming actor who plays him and, most of all, for the object of his affections -- a bullied and beaten-down naif who uses the movies to escape both of her depressions.The funniest and smartest of Allen's supernatural tales works on a variety of levels, most importantly in the way it celebrates the power of fantasy but also subverts it. The ending is like a terrible punch to the heart, not softened in the least by its obvious inevitability."
4,"Just like the Title of the Book, it's a study of our Victory in Christ.","Sorry to say, I have only read half, but what I have read, is very enlightening. Lots of great history information with scripture to back up all that is being taught. I would recommend this book for anyone who is of the Preterist belief and if you have not come to this belief, it's a great book to get into your library for a good understanding of history's greatest subject, The Word of God."
2,I didn't really 'get it',"First off, let me say that nothing bugs me more than people who rate an album as being poor because ""it wasn't what I was expecting at all"" based on an artist's past work. It's important that artists don't stagnate and do the same thing over and over again. This one just didn't click with me though as I felt there was very little to enjoy."
3,Evaporator Pad,"The Evaporator Pad had a lower quality than the earlier ones I had purchased, with a lot of fines/dust."
3,Injustice to the Original,"While the casting of most of the characters in the screen version of this book are perfect, the online storyline and character development are disappointing. The Becky Sharpe of the film version is seen as resourceful but has a heart; however, the Becky of literature is self serving and hateful to anyone who she views as an obstacle, including her own child. Perhaps the screenwriter strayed so far from the original story so that people would like the lead character a little. The A&E mini series is closer to the book storyline. The only reason I gave this version 3 stars is the fact that I like period films and thought the acting was well-done even if the interpretation is incorrect. Read the book and make your own decisions."
2,"cute, clever, pretty but not correct","The BBC tv series is closest to the book.This film is not much more than a colorful cartoon for those who can't read or will not read a book. It is supposed to be for the modern audience. Perhaps it is but it failed to make a profit and critics laughed at it one might say. Even the trailer on Youtube is worthless by my judgement,How can something so pretty be such a mess? Dunno. It's not Becky Sharp and not Vanity Fair in my humble opinion.It has value if you want to see how a great novel can be cleansed by scrubbing away all truth and reality. Hmmmmm, perhaps that is the way to treat modern viewers ----or is it?Still it has merits. Although one of the merits may be how not to make a movie."
3,Great Costumes,"I am a reader so seeing this movie inspired me to read the book. It does not follow the book exactly as no movie does, but it was more enjoyable. I really like the dance scene."
1,Vanity Fair,"This movie looks beautful, acting is fantatic, screenplay..sucks. It's long, boring and somewhat confusing.I only bought it for Robert Pattinson. He is only in the extra's the alternate ending.Vanity Fair (Widescreen)"
2,Vanity Fair;... stange affair...,"I did not read the novel, but I bet the adaptation is pretty bad. This is a strange movie. It seems that a lot of staff was trying to be fit into the movie and not successfully at all. The movie spans more than 10 years, yet noone except the children gets physically older. The motivations behind characters' actions are a mystery - most of the time a viewer is dumbfounded. For example, one moment George Osborne cant stand his fiance, the next - he marries her. Hah? The 2 stars are for the pretty and colorful costumes and scenery. Also, I thought all the young men did not look very manly, with all the feathery clothes and ""rooster"" hairdos :) What's with their hair? ""Persuasion"" of 1995 is of exact same period - no funky hair in there."
3,Decent Watch Case,"For simply displaying my cases I am satisfied. Workmanship of product has its flaws, but are not noticeable to the casual browser. For $40, this is not an entirely bad first display case for the watch enthusiast!"
2,In the trash,"I enjoy Christian fiction, especially appreciating the combination of biblical truths and historical facts woven into a fictional story. While somewhat redeeming in its message of saving faith, this book, is very poorly written, almost surprisinly so, and far too incredulous to be believeable. I skimmed through to the end, and promptly threw it in the trash."
4,Not easily scared,"Courtney is always making fools of Eddie and his friends. Eddie is easily scared and when Courtney humiliates him on a field trip, Eddie and his friends decide to get even with her. They are going to scare her real good. But how do you scare someone who isn't afraid of anything?This one is a fun read. I enjoyed the story and how their plans kept going wrong. A rather light hearted Goosebumps."
1,It would be difficult to underrate this film.,"Watching this film is a little like being a spectator at a bad acting competition, with spot prizes for wooden expressions to play for. Jenny Lumet wins both, with extra credit for random overacting, but Timothy Hutton puts up a grand fight for second place. The script is wordy way past the point of tedium: it HAS to be based on a bad play. It's like a very literate writer trying desperately to be authentic, but unwilling to discard a single line he's ever heard in a cop movie. Never mind: you can have a fine time playing 'count the hard-boiled cop cliches'. Cheap special effects, along with a listless score and jarring theme song,reinforce the impression that nobody's heart was in it.Some distinguished people were associated with the making of this film. I hope they've had a good long think about what they've done."
3,A big addition,"I have the battery pack for the CP 8800 and it feels just right. However, the much larger pack on the D100 feels just too big. It's very well made and gives you some options that would greatly increase your shooting capacity.I sold it cause it just wasn't right for me. If someone didn't mind increasing the size of their D100 by that much, it might be fine."
5,one of the best one shot comics ever.,What Neil Gaiman does is to bring together the different ideas all of us have about what life is and apply it to one mans death. If you can find it buy it it will affect you especially if you have ever experienced the death of a loved one.
3,leather band,"nice watch, but the leather band doesn't work well with a watch this size. it hasn't broke in very well and tends to slip ""around"" . Probably an item that should be tried on first at a store before buying."
4,Great book that explains how things work in plain English.,"This book covers a lot of areas: appliances, machines, buildings, transportation, communication, etc. Each topic was explained in plain language, yet as much as I wanted to know about that topic. Great pictures and illustrations too!"
2,WHERE'S THE DANGER?????,"After reading and enjoying ""The Forbidden Lord"" and ""The Dangerous Lord"", I had high hopes for ""The Dangerous Lord"". Alas, this book is simply not Ms. Jeffries best. A thin plot, no danger (or dangerous hero), and simply not enough action or romance to warrant your purchasing this book. You would do much better to order Suzanne Enoch's ""Meet Me At Midnight"". Let's hope Ms. Jeffries does better next time."
3,surprisingly touching,"once i knew what the plot line was i thought it would be a really inspidread. however, i found the hero's character to be interesting in how he changed during the course of the book and not just from his ""lust"" for her, which is too prevalent in most romance novels. he truly seemed to look into himself & understand his motives by the book's conclusion.the heroine seemed to be a somewhat well thought-out character, but her running away to become an actress did not seem logical in the context of the entire book. the continuing references to her as an 'amazon' was way over the top as was the quoting of shakespeare between them. i enjoy romance books which keep to the plot and do not distract themselves with sub-plot 'who dunnits' to keep the books interesting and this one did it well."
5,Absolutely the BEST!,Absolutely the BEST classical guitarist I have listened to in quite a while! Love this CD - it is a must buy for those who appreciate fine classical guitar!!!
2,If you loved the originals - you will be disappointed!,"Too late I realized these were a new recording by an unrelated Orchestra - is NOT under the direction of John Barry. If you heard and LOVED how the originals sounded - and I am referring here to the James Bond themes which I am most familiar with, then you will be disappointed. Technically well done here but pacing, the nuance, etc. of the originals is missing. How sad! So now will remember to buy the actual _soundtrack_ albums if I want to come away with the ""motion picture"" experience of the original scores...Stu AullAlaska"
3,Good exercises but too short,"I know this DVD is an ""Express"" one, but I didn't even break a sweat. It says the total DVD time is 50 minutes and I know would include instruction, etc. but the total actual warm up and workout time is less than 25 minutes. The workout is squats, widestand squats, standing lunges, calf raises and lateral thigh raises, each for 30 to 90 minutes. There is no inner thigh work. This is a good supplement to other exercises but not enough on it's own."
1,Very disappointed,"I STILL have NOT received this item and have not been contacted back! I was charged but never got my item, and will NOT be doing business with them again."
4,great instant classic,"this is a movie from my childhood. not a great movie for little kids but i fell in love instantly. When i bought the dvd after not seeing it in years, the story line was still good but the make-up and effects weren't as good but hey it was a movie made in the '80s so for the time they did pretty good. my kids when they watched it these days thought it was funny but a little scary.But they are used all the high tech movies."
3,"Most of the FX still hold up, but not as ""good"" as I remembered","This is a movie I grew up with and used to love as a kid. Although I've always found the ending a bit cheesy, I still liked it a lot. After seeing it again after many years, it's not as good as I used to think it was, but the special effects shots, the majority of them at least, hold up very well. The use of stop-motion animation with the little demons are still really cool to look at, especially when the zombie worker hidden in the wall falls to the floor and turns into a bunch of those little demons. It is the most memorable scene in the movie. It's pretty much a scary movie for kids, but it does have a few ""S***s"" thrown in. It's not very scary if you're an adult, but still a cool flick if you're in the mood for a cheesy '80s horror movie."
4,"""80's Horror!""",Stephen Dorff stars in this 1987 horror film.Two kids unwittingly unleash demons afterdigging a hole in the backyard. This is agreat film and used to scare me as a kid.This special edition has good picture andsound plus a couple neat extras. I highlyrecommend this 80's horror classic.
5,a beloved classic for sure,"i just wanted to say being a huge horror,black metal fan.i feel in love with this movie like no other since..when i saw terry wearing a venom jacket i freaked out and the all the heavy metal posters in that bedroom!!!awesome visuals!!! that was me in my youth.what is there not to like about this movie the special effects,occult story line supernational subject matter...with out going into the plot that hasnt been said before two kids dig a hole in the back yard and the gates of hell are opened...just buy it you wont regret it...the gate rules then and today"
4,This is the 5353 - the product image is wrong,"These are the correct labels (based on the description) - arrived promptly and the price is right, but the product image on the page is incorrect."
3,The book every Gamecock must have!,"I was disappointed when my book arrived. I was not prepared for a pre-teen book on Thomas Sumter. But, I do think it is a must have for every South Carolinian and Gamecock fan. It is obviously easy reading. Even for a 6 year old. Some facts, but mostly an overview of the man, the myth, the legend."
4,A beautiful prequel to Clay's Quilt.....,"I chose Clay's Quilt a few months ago for my book club. I wish I had chose A Parchment of Leaves instead. It was much better, perhaps because Clay's was a first novel. I enjoyed putting all the pieces of the Sizemore clan together and wrapping it up in one neat package.A PARCHMENT OF LEAVES tells the story of Vine, Clay's great-grandmother and her husband Saul in the WWI years. The story is told in first person (something CLAY'S QUILT) was not and htis seems to make it more realistic somehow. The author uses typical mountain speak, country phrases and the brand of dialect that would be found in rural Kentucky, giving the characters the feel that they could just jump off the page at any minute.I loved this book. It was very honest, very real and very gripping. Definitely worth a read!"
1,Janet Evanovich...how could you???,I am a big fan of the Stephanie Plum series and was really looking forward to this. This was BAD! The characters try to be as quirky and funny as those in the Plum novels but miss the mark completely. I'm surprised Janet wrote this. I'll stay a fan of the Plum series but will pass on all the Full series. I have no interest in finding out if the characters live another day.
2,The only good thing about this book is the end interview.,"I've generally enjoyed the comic mysteries of Janet Evanovich, featuring bounty hunter Stephanie Plum . . . so when I had the opportunity to listen to FULL BLAST by the author andCharlotte Hughes, I decided to give it a try . . . this is part of another series involving supposedly zany characters that are involved in what might be called a romantic mystery (a newspapereditor adds a new personals section, then finds that its readers are getting killed) . . . I felt little for any of the characters, nor did the narration by Lorelei King do very much for me . . . what I likedbest about FULL BLAST actually had nothing to do with the story . . . at the very end, there was a brief interview of Janet Evanovich about how she goes about her daily writing . . . I liked it very much and just wish that it had been longer."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting more from the author of the Plum series. This book felt awfully slow - the characters were predictable and frankly not that interesting, the murderer turned otu to be an outsider who was not even introduced into the book until near the end, and there was nothing unexpected or even particularly interesting about the romance. The secondary characters were not especially original, but seemed completely like stereotypes. I would not recommend this book even as a beach read."
3,A Memorable Performer,Sophie Tucker belonged to an age long gone but her singing and her interpretations are worth listening to. Very much from the era of 'Music Halls' in England.
5,Must have in your DVD collection,I am a huge fan of Sacha Baron Cohen. I believe he is one of the Best character actors in the industry. His variety of characters keep you entertained and laughing throughout each segment. This HBO Ali G series is a must have in your DVD collection. He is definitely keepin it real.
3,nice for the price,Bought this for my younger chameleon and its nice for the price. It comes in pieces and you screw them together. The screen latches are plastic not metal and am worried they will break. It is light weight and easy to put together. Has plenty of room for climbing decorations and fits nicely on my shelf. I would recomend for anyone who needs a affordable screen cage.
5,Great Cage,We bought this cage for our baby Chameleons - easy to assemble - sturdy and exactly what we needed... we will be purchasing the Zilla brand again!
2,Drill Book,"I was not impressed with this item. The best part of the book is the cover. There are no photographs inside the book. There are stick figure profile view drawings, and that's about all."
1,BoxWave Resolute OA3,"I'd have to say I was disappointed by this product in that it was listed as featuring 3 layers of protection, and I really only saw it as 2, I really don't think it's fair to count the little added padding on the rubber layer as a third layer, I had thought that the case would have had some sort of screen protection, but much to my disappointment it did not. I think that it's a great product in itself, but it's no Otterbox, which is what I always went with before for protection for my phones. I went with the BoxWave case because it was cheaper than the Otterbox, but I should have known better and went with the Otterbox, I really don't that I'd recommend that anyone else buy a BoxWave case over an Otterbox one, and I don't think I will ever again."
3,Years,"It had been many years since I had read this book, and I still enjoyed it. BUT!!!!!! What software did they use to create the kindle version of this book or did they use someone who does not read English? It took a long time to figure out the common errors, but some things were just unreadable, for example at time was A'*; how to you figure out that time. Read the printed version first to get the most out of the book."
3,Sits on my shelf,"I bought this book hoping to find some useful tips and tools. I was not really impressed by it. It sits on my shelf, about half read. This might be a great book for other leaders or those looking to inspire certain leaders, but I did not get much from it."
3,I Will Fight No More Forever,"I very good and accurate movie about Chief Joseph and the NezPerce Indian War. Not the best acting, however a excellent story."
1,Not as advertised,Not as advertised; it is a copy from VHS with a jumpy picture; had to use Amazon A-to-z Claim because seller wouldn't answer emails.
3,Not as good as the footy wars,Bruce 2000 is a tribute cd (dont know whether its comedy or what)to Australias football and Olympic commentator Bruce Mc avaney. This cd isnt as good as the Aussie rules comedy album the Footy wars but its is a must have for any football or sports fan.
2,Poor entertainment and history,"""The Message"" is a very appropriate title. The makers have something that they want to communicate and and they don't let history get in their way. This is essentially an evangelistic movie that targets westerners for conversion.The acting is very poor and some of the transitions in the movie are a little disjointed.The most annoying thing is that the main character (Mohammed)is never seen. This is reminescent of the rabbit Harvey in the movie ""Harvey"" with Jimmy Stewart. Harvey's invisibility added to the comedy, but ""The Message"" is not trying to be funny. There are many times when it is not clear who a character is speaking to because he is looking at the camera or at nothing. The only clue when Mohammed is around is if he is carrying something (like a long sword) or a tune that is played.If you are looking for an entertaining movie with invisible people, this is not it. If you are looking for an educational experience, this is not it."
5,I only with Bush and Cheney would view this film!,A profound film on the roots of the Islamic faith. Granted it was a Hollywood film but nonetheless it got the point across that there is more similarity between Islam and Christianity than most Americans thought possible. I would like to make this film a prerequisite for political office. Right now hatred for Muslims and the Islamic faith is at an all time high and that is very unfortunate. So unfortunate that it could lead to total anniliation of the human race! We must learn to deal with other faiths because our lives depend on it. This film underscored the vast similarities in all religous beliefs rather than the differences as we so often get in the mainstream press and other media. You must see this film and encourage others to see it. It is timeless. The acting of course is superb.
5,The Message,TRULY EXCEPTIONAL!A WONDERFUL & ACCURATE INTRODUCTION TO ISLAM!A GREAT MOVIE FOR THOSE WANTING TO KNOW ABOUT ISLAM!
3,Flannel Sheets,Sheets are soft and they fit the bed well. There was black lint everywhere. I thought my floor had dirt on it. Fills the dryer lint vent too.
2,the ending came not a moment to soon,"At best this book was tedious, I will not bore you with one word more nor could I have written one word less (required)"
2,disappointed,"I was recommended this author recently. The person that was reading it was very enthusiastic about it. I decided to try one of his book and I choose based on reviews on amazon. Well, I found the book incredibly boring. The plot is so naive and predictable. The characters are stereotypical and shallowly described. When I had read half of the book, I started skipping paragraphs, then pages. In the beginning I just wanted to check how it would end, but even that was not interesting."
3,Lots of twists in this one to keep you interested. A good book.,I like his style. I found this one a little less believable than others but must say I kept going back and finished it!
1,Not a Penny More Not a Penny Less,The story was good. The book that I received was a used library book. I was not happy with that. Lem Hagler
1,A Penny Less,"Very boring. I like Archer's works about family (ATCF and Kane & Abel) as well as his thrillers (Matter of Honor, Eleventh Commandment) I just wasn't in the mood for this book. I can see it being interesting to some as the book did have an interesting twist but not my cup of TEA."
3,Very dated - but OK,An easy read on a obvious story line. Keep reminding yourself that this book was written in 1973 and you'll enjot it more.
5,A Great Book,"Not a penny more, not a penny less, is a book about four people who lose over a million dollars in a stock market scam. They get together and decide to steal all there money back, but not a penny more, not a penny less. I enjoyed this book a lot, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed movies like Oceans Eleven and The Italian Job. The plot was great, and it has twists and turns along the way, that keep you reading it. It is definitely a book worth checking out."
4,Not a penny more not a penny less,"The book gave not a penny more nor less than it was supposed to, very exciting most of the time but lost momentum towards the end and became a bit unrealistic...good writing though."
3,"A good, if somewhat simplistic view of Modern Arnis.","This book is not a comprehensive primer on Modern Arnis, but is rather a very simple overview of the basics. It covers the 12 basic angles of attack and a defense for each angle, then briefly touches on the empty handed applications of the art. The coverage of sinawali was interesting and clear, but was, again, very simplistic, although I did find the basic flow drills to be useful.In short, this book is interesting and a potentially useful source of information for someone who studies an art that doesn't incorporate the concept of flow, however, if you study Escrima, Arnis, Kenpo, etc., you might want to keep looking."
1,a bad book on the Filipino martial arts,"From the title this book has problems. First, Arnis is much more than ""stick fighting."" The complete art, unlike this book, includes a variety of empty hand and different weapon techniques. Secondly, the art, unlike this book, emphasizes movement and flowing techniques done rapidly in a chain like series. In short, this book is probably the worst on the market and it's description of the Filipino martial arts is very distorted. Try any of the other books on the market instead."
2,Too basic,"Many liked this book. I did not. I thought the basics were too basic and many important things were left out. I also dislike the author's characterization of arnis as ""stick fighting."" It's really much more and he knew it despite the fact that many people wished to see it as such and were willing to pay him to teach them ""stickfighting."" Anyway, my two cents, if you want something better, there are better books that focus on fundamental movements of feet, hands and body, and the use of empty hands and several weapons, much more than this one."
4,Good value,"I've been playing guitar for about 10 years and recently wanted to get my Son a guitar for his birthday. The look of the guitar is nice and the sound is decent. For 50.00, the guitar is a solid value. the overall sound of the guitar is some where between ukulele and a full size guitar."
5,Magical,"Swirley's first book is a an absolute gem. The perfect gift for everyone you care about. The book is filled with inspiration, humor and gorgeous illustrations. I can't wait to see what this talent stirs up next!"
5,"Tom, Eat our shorts","Eddie and the Cruisers was a hit with everyone that understands Rock n Roll and loves the E-Street band style. I think Bruce got some of his ideas from this movie and John Cafferty. Tom, stick to rating cook books or something else."
5,I'm in love!!!,"OMG! I have to confess, I've never seen this movie before. Where have I been! I am TOTALLY in love with Micheal Pare!. I saw the second movie,too. Even better than the first. I have bought the movies, and all the sound tracks. I will play those tracks FOREVER!"
1,artic? express,This cd was a waste of my money not what I thought it would be at all . It was not good music.
3,I like this book becuse its fun to read.,my favorite part is whean he finds out his dad has another son and took him out for pizza. leth botts had a good life unital his mom and dad had a divors
4,Dear Mr. Henshaw...,Dear Mr. Henshaw is a great book! I like this book because it is interesting. This one sad part made me cry. I was happy again when it was not sad anymore. Also the main character is Leigh Botts. He is a good son to have if you were his mother. Beverly Cleary worked must have really hard on this book. It is a perfect book for ages 7-12. This manuscript is awesome!
4,Dear Mr. Henshaw,"I read Dear Mr. Henshaw and it is about a boy named Leigh Botts and he has a pretty hard life. His parents are divorced (just like my parents.) He has a dog named Bandit, but towards the end of the book Leigh gives Bandit to his dad, so Leigh doesn't really have a friend. So Leigh is a lonely kid. Also Leigh's lunch gets stolen a lot but he finds out a really funny strategy. I recommend this book to people who like to write a lot. I really loved this book and I hope you will too!~E.S."
3,A GIANT LETER,This is a revaue of dear. Mr. Henshalw.Atleste a part of it enyway.I liked it beacause of Liegh.You should read it sometime .I dont like the copeyrs in the book they copyed a diff-rent poem insted of there own.Dosent make sence dos it.I gave it 3stars beacause it wasent super good gust reguler good.Not very interesting is it.the end BY J-E-R-E-M-Y
2,this was a disapointing book,Dear Mr. Henshaw was a disapointing book because a lot of the questions I had about the book were not answered.
1,"Dear Mr.Henshaw, a real let-down","I read this book for a school reading compitition. I thought it would be a good book because I like Beverly Cleary, but it was sad the whole way through the book. I didn't like this book at all!!!"
4,A Perfect Book For 5th Graders,"Wow, what a great book for fifth Graders! The book ""Dear Mr. Henshaw"" by Beverly Cleary is about a boy named Leigh Botts. Leigh moves to a new town with his mother. His parents are divorced and he is lonely. Leigh writes a letter to his favorite author Mr. Henshaw. He askes Mr. Henshaw lots of questions and Mr. Henshaw writes him back. Leigh begins to write to Mr. Henshaw all of the time because it helps him figure out his own feelings. He becomes a better writer for this. Leigh enters a writing contest and the winner gets to meet a famous writer. Do you think he will win the contest? Do you think that famous writer could be Mr. Henshaw? Do you think that Leigh will make new friends at his new school? Will Leigh's parents get back together? All of these questions can be answered by reading this great book."
5,Better then sliced bread,"This has to be the best series out. I thoroughly enjoyed the series. I love how every episode builds on the next. I had purchased Season 1 and 2 of Justice League Unlimited and while unessary, now watching Season 1 & 2 of Justice League makes JL Unlimited make more sense. The stories are very will thought out and compelling. I would definitely advise purchasing this series as well as JL Unlimited. I know that they now have the complete series available so that I would purchase that."
4,Price,"Not sure how Amazon has done this, but if you buy these separately you'll save $34 from this high price."
3,this movie ROCKS,Me and My Boyfriend thought it was weird and cool (i love vampires) and Drew Fuller was Hot in this movie and we also like it because we are goth but it rocked and we would watch it aginRock OnGo See This MovieI suggest little kids and people with weak stomicks not to watch this
3,It's okay BUT....,"I got this toy when my daughter was about 11 or 12 months old. I have to say that she absolutley loves this toy then and now. The problem is that there are a couple buttons that trip her up. There's a toggle to flip for a horse and a lever to pull down for a cow and they're extremely hard to push over and pull down. She always gets frustrated when trying to do these two animal's levers and I end up having to help her. She's now 19 months old and still is having problems with the horse lever and can just barely get the cow lever down half the time. And I'd like to make it known that she's not a weak child! Still, she likes this toy. Just don't expect a 9 month old to pull all the toggles themselves. This maker should've made these easier to manipulate. Or maybe I just got a defective one:-) I'd be my luck."
3,IT'S GREAT!!!!!!!,"Thilling movie!! A little ""Risque"", but was entertained. Diane Lane is GREAT in this movie. The end is worth waiting for. Nothing bloody or gross, just bad language and some nudity.Gail M. McGuire...Peace On Earth!!!!!"
3,Keeping Abreast Of Diane Lane,"This movie definitely has a Grade B feel to it. Diane Lane is only ""star"" actor in here and she wasn't that big a name in '87 anyway. In fact, she was just starting out in the business.The story is sleazy one about a window dresser (Lane) who exhibits almost-pornographic displays with her window mannequins.These semi-erotic dressings attract a stalker to Lane and that's where the suspense come in....good suspense.Lane is great to ogle and is not modest in showing herself to us. Actually, this film seems to be only a vehicle or an excuse for the pretty actress to show off her breasts. Otherwise, it's standard ""B"" fare, because the story isn't much. I'm not surprised it never made it to DVD. Lane has gone on to more modest roles."
3,To be read for information rather than enjoyment,"There seems to be a consensus that Pogue's massive biography is the definitive authority on Marshall. Certainly every possible detail is included, which is why the book is so huge. If you want the most possible information on Marshall or on any particular phase of his life, go find a copy of one or all volumes of Pogue's work.I found the reading slow going and sometimes the level of detail stood in the way of a strong narrative. Contrast this with, say, Caro's biography of LBJ, where each instance of delving into deeper detail and closer focus just makes the book more intensely gripping."
1,What???,"This movie was HORRIBLE! Neither myself or my 10 year old could make it all the way through this movie. It was very poorly written and acted, it was boring and half the time it didn't make any sense!"
3,A Couple Gems But------,"Admittedly NOT my favorite Holdsworth effort, but it still has some worthwhile moments, those coming in the form of the beautiful ""Funnels"", the fiery title cut and ""Looking Glass"" (featuring Allan's former employer Tony Williams tearing it up on the drums).The rest however for me was at best rough going. The main complaint I have is that blasted Synth-Axe, or rather, the sound sources it triggers. Just WAAAYYYYY too much high-tech digital synth overkill, it proves rather grating and fatiguing to the ears with its cold, mechanical atmosphere, it sounds DISGUSTINGLY dated in an 80's kind of way (and that's NEVER a good thing). Tracks like ""The Dominant Plague"" and ""Non-Brewed Condiment"" bear this out most painfully, and even more so on the disjointed ""All Our Yesterdays"", despite a very heartfelt soprano voice performance from Rowanne Mark.For completeists only."
4,Hello! This was written by a KID.,"What the heck is up with some of these reviewers? HELLO! This story was written by a LITTLE GIRL, not a teacher! What is wrong with you people? Shame on you! ...Now, for everybody with a conscience, check it out: This story is cute. It's not Hemingway, it's not Shakespeare, but it's cute. If you read it for entertainment's sake, and keep in mind a kid wrote it, you'll like it. (And hey--if you're not reading for entertainment, you won't enjoy it no matter WHAT it is. Some of these kids' reviews sound like they were forced on pain of death to read the thing, sheesh.) It's a story about a girl and a talking zebra-thing who knows math, and a bunch of scientific horses. I repeat: it's cute."
4,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed the story quite a bit. Not too bad for something written by a 13-year-old kid. Not too bad at all.Obviously anybody who doesn't like it just didn't ""get"" it. ;-)"
5,Understanding deeper in the Word,"This is a slower way to understand the scripture....It has helped me to go deeper in the Word.....I have only has this book a few weeks but, an really enjoying reading the Bible with more understanding...and you can go at your own pace..."
3,Good book but not enough for passing the exam,"After reading this book from cover to cover. Studying each chapter and reviewing the respective questions. I passed the test. Needless to say, I did not pass with flying colors. The book covers many of the new features of Windows 2000 Server. If you use this book as your only source for preparing for the exam, be prepared for a few exam 'surprises'. The book is enough to pass the test but only with experience with Win 2k server and coupled possibly with some NT experience. Read the book throughly and best of luck. Personally, I would suggest coupling your training with some more in depth study material."
1,Save Your Money,The exam cram 70-210 book was pretty good. The 70-215 is a complete waste of money. It was not even good enough for review...let alone cramming for the test. Many required topics covered...but none deep enough to assist you in passing the test.
5,Another Excellent Work from Lelia Kelly,"I've been a fan ever since Presumption of Guilt hit the bookshelves, but this thriller intrigued me even more than the first one. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop (even though we had company visiting). Don't start the book unless you have some time to spare, because it is hard to put down! I am anxiously awaiting her next masterpiece!"
4,The People that Really Rule the World,"Interesting little movie. The Tom Hulse character finds himself on the bad side of ""The People That Really Rule the World"". He careens through the movie trying to discover what happened and why his life is in a death spiral. He/You doesn't figure out what its all about until almost the end leaving barely enough time to extricate himself.Good story with good acting and the compelling song ""High Hopes"" by Tim McConnell - the artist that came to be known as Ledfoot. A good watch every year of two."
1,From Amadeus to this?,"Apparently when this was first released it was largely ignored and it should have stayed that way. While Adam Ant was memorable in this film, the other actors should wipe it from their resumes. Hulce, the star of ""Amadeus"" was over-the-top, an over-emoting unbelievable character. At times the editing was confusing as the movie darted about. The only good thing I can find to say about this is that it is over. To compare this to Hitchcock is an insult to Hitchcock! Though I may stand alone in my opinion here, you may be the person who would agree with me, so, caveat emptor."
4,overlooked gem,"This is a wonderful book reeking with authenticity about the hard lives lived in country music before the glitter of CMT. Cobb is a beautiful, spare stylist whose penchant for the truth keeps him from jumping on a glib music business plot and adorning it with with easy ornamentation. He's after something deeper here about tragedy and human limitations. I never could understand why this novel failed to garner a larger following other than the usual vagaries of the book business that sheds non bestselling titles within three weeks. ""Crazy Heart,"" I suspect, is one that is destined to be rediscovered."
5,Loved it!! Loved the movie!! Loved the music!!,"I usually will read a book first and then watch the movie, but in this case, I had seen the movie (a couple of times) and then read the book. I know the book was written long before the movie, but since I saw the movie first, I'll write the review as such:The book follows the movie, a few changes, but nothing big. The book was soo good, I can't say that enough. I could hear Jeff Bridges voice as I was reading which made it even better. I highly recommend this book, I couldn't put it down, even though I knew the story already!"
5,"A deep look at one performer's life, steeped in alcohol but with some surprises left","This novel formed the basis for Jeff Bridge's astonishing performance in the title role of the movie with the same name. The book is worth reading on its own. After seeing the movie, I couldn't wait to read it. As expected, it is a novel to read slowly, lingering over the descriptions. It is a worthy addition to books dealing with alcoholics and doesn't spare any details about the depths of despair - and havoc - wreaked by a guy on the way down. However, there is far more to the book than an unhappy life and it is an excellent character study as well as a totally engrossing read. Even if you've seen the movie, you owe it to yourself to read the novel which inspired it!"
3,What Connection?,"I have read many of Jacques Vallee's thoughtful, insightful books on UFOs. This is my least favorite. He makes a connection in the book between UFO phenomena and cult leaders who claim to have been contacted by the Aliens. Why assume Aliens have contacted them at all? Maybe the cult leaders are crazy. Maybe they're opportunistic psychopaths. It appears that throughout history terrifying visions have been shown to some contactees. I personally agree with John Keel who put forth the idea that doom and gloom scenarios shown to contactees were more like scare crows. - You mess with us, you trespass on our turf, and we'll scare the hell out of you in any way we can. So stay away. -"
5,True Metal Masterpiece,"Believe the hype! Cage's Darker Than Black is everything you demand and more. Fans of Primal Fear, Halford, Judas Priest, early Savatage will absolutely love this album. Guaranteed to melt your ears off and have you screaming for more! Support this band, buy this album and tell your metalhead friends. This is the real stuff: Gargantuan riffs, pounding double bass drums, blistering solos, powerful vocals with range, terrific packaging and fantastic artwork. This band will not disappoint. I tell you in all honesty there isn't a filler track on the whole CD, favorites include: Kill the Devil, Eyes of Obsidian and White Magic. These guys play true metal recalling the days of classic Priest, but with a refreshing new take. Buy this CD now!"
4,Crushing Metal!,"I first heard of this band in Metal Maniacs. I purchased the cd after listening to the demos, especially chupacabra. I would describe the sound as Painkiller meets Forbidden Evil {esp Twisted Into Form}, except that music is 10 years old and these guys are here right now.This is take no prisoners stuff. Everyone in the band knows how to play. Very tight, fast,and hooky. The first time I listened to Wings of Destruction the hair stood up on the back of my neck.If you will like power metal, this is for you. Long Live Cage!"
5,Nice Product - Great Price,"We received the scale in good condition and within 2 or 3 days of it being ordered (during the Christmas rush). It takes a little getting used to to get it to come on, lifting it with your toe seems to be the best, but it performs just fine."
5,Very Nice,It was exactly as described and it works pretty well. It took a little while for me to understand the tapping technique that would turn it on. I actually think it works best to lift up under the scale with your foot and it always starts right up.
1,Non-working Garbage,"The scale arrived and was completely nonfunctional. I tried every single suggestion to get it to turn on, from the toe tap to the lift, to picking it up and waltzing with it. It absolutely would not turn on. I even changed out the batteries multiple times (with known good batteries of the same type) and reversed them in multiple configurations... all in a vain attempt to get this scale to do anything at all. I am extremely disappointed in this product and based on this, and many other reviews, I would strongly advise other potential buyers against purchasing this scale, if for no other reason than the obviously poor (perhaps nonexistent) quality-control at the manufacturer. And now I have to waste my own time and effort to return the product and get a refund."
1,Scale Totally Unreliable,"This scale appeared to be a good buy, judging from the earlier reviews. It gave accurate readings for about two weeks and then went haywire, searching and searching for a weight. I tried to reset it by removing the batteries for a minute, but to no avail. It currently displays the ""8"" character and sometimes the ""0.0"" as it is supposed to, and then turns off or shows a bogus weight (say, 215 for a 160-pound person).I am returning this useless piece of garbage. How can a manufacturer produce something like this? Don't they at least try to produce products that work? Do they test them in a quality control procedure? This is shameful. How difficult is it to produce a bathroom scale?"
3,Accurate ( Does not last long),"This scale is accurate, pretty and easy to use. I weigh myself once a week early in the morning before heading to Weight Watchers, the reading on both scales are the same.Turning on the scale once the batteries are on is a breeze, just move it with your foot wait for it to read zero then step on it.I purchased this product in May of 2011 it is now November of 2011 and it has died. I changed the battery twice and no response. It has been in my bedroom so it has not been expose to water or humidity. I have tried to contact Newline to get an address to send it back but have not received a response.Update: I did hear from customer service at Newline. They made arrangements for me to get a new scale all I had to do is pay for the shipping and handling. Therefore I will upgrade to three stars, hopefully this scale will last at least a one year."
4,I love it,"The negative reviews are pretty misleading. This weighing machine is so easy to switch on. Just lift it with your toe, slightly drop it, it switches on. It isn't tough at all. It looks wonderful, and I got this product after a lot of research, and I will say that this was the best price available for such a machine:- looks good, easy to use, has worked for me for 6months now, good pricing."
5,Masterpiece of black metal prog,"This is hands down a masterpiece in the genre of black metal progressive rock. Vintersorg are in a class by themselves! I can't explain how brilliant this album is. It mixes folk,viking,pagan,black,progressive and avant garde with the melodic and majestic vocals. I recommend ALL of Vintersorg's work. The vocalist also sings in Borknagar another fantastic black metal progressive rock band."
3,"Decent, But Not Very Good.","As far as hunting videos go, this one is not too bad. It is not some bloodthristy flic where hunting is little more than one quenching their bloodthrust. No, its a sensible treatment of hunting. My only complaint is that the movie does not provide enough hands on info. Other than that, it is a good movie."
4,Meow Magick!,"Well written and very entertaining for an enchanting, cozy evening of making potions with and for your familiars."
4,Label over instructions,"I purchased these tablets in preparation for a surgery I am having at the recommendation of my doctor. It is supposed to limit bruising. I received the bottle but the company selling it puts a big sticky label over the instructions. After carefully peeling it back, I found out the correct doseage for adults is 4 tablets dissolved under the tounge 4 times a day. The tablets dissolve quickly and do not taste bad. They taste slightly sugary. The only other complaint I had is that it looks like several of the tablets were crushed to powder in the bottom of the bottle. The tablets easily crumble so I guess that is why."
2,Interesting story told with dull writing,"Thud, thud, thud went the dialogue; clang, clang, clang went the prose.I liked the story quite a bit. It was rich with possibilities: a mother who won't stop dying as she questions her religion toward the end; a yuppified gay couple (one of whom is her son) that lives in the suburbs; a lesbian-questioning-pregnant women's music performer (the mother's daughter); a little bit of online sex; a sympathetic yet philandering father/husband. Yet it didn't work. The dialogue is so dreary, so heavy, that it reminded me of high school creative writing class. Page 244, in which April finds her way to New York and meets her brother in the airport exemplifies simplistic, sterile storytelling with truly horrendous, flat dialogue. Why can't Leavitt do his somewhat gripping story and genuinely touching plot more good than that? Oy. This novel needs a writer."
2,FIA SB9005-1 Sandblast Holld,"I was a little disappointed with the lack of Velcro around the lens area and also with the buckle on the waist strap. The material that the hood is made from looks to be durable. I had additional Velcro sewn around the lens area in hopes to seal it better also, a new quick release buckle to get the hood off quicker. I hope to give the hood a good work out very soon."
5,The great CD,"I'm glad that I bought this CD for my son. The great music,excellent singers and musicians. I think that you and your kids will like this CD."
2,"Decent cut, will need alterations","This dress has a nice cut, but won't be flattering on anyone without alterations. My tailor will have to raise the hem 3-4 inches and take in the shoulder straps. The fabric is polyester and a bit cheap feeling, but it will work fine with a cute jacket or shawl for weddings or nice dinners out."
4,excellent.,"""And it's been three long years since midday...""Thus begins the first full length disk of sing sing, Emma Anderson and Lisa O'Neil's new band. Sing sing does not have nor aspire to create the ethereal sounds of lush. It is clearly its own style defined by the beautiful voice of Lisa O'Neil. Themes transition from lost love to friendship and joy. The music is excellent and varies according to the theme. While there are perhaps two songs on the disk I do not care for (including one troubling duet), there are four or five new songs that are so strong - ""everything,"" ""I'll be,"" ""me and my friend,"" ""panda eyes,"" etc. - that they easily carry the weight. Two of the three songs from the feels like summer single disk are also remixed on this disk (though I have no idea why ""hit and run"" was omitted). The fact that Emma Anderson was in the band led me to blindly buy the ""feels like summer"" single last year. When I heard a full disk had been released, I bought it immediately. I love both of them."
2,Sony censors Cash,"Overall, this would have been a pretty good Johnny Cash compilation.Unfortunately, Sony chose to censor a line from ""Boy Named Sue"" with a loud bleep. It ruins the song, and in my opinion taints the entire release. I bought this CD to hear Cash, not a butchered hack-job by Sony's lawyers."
3,"great cd, but lets focus elsewhere","great cd and no one can replace johnny , but lets focus on the living legends! check out the grammy winning ""Van lear rose"" by the great loretta lynn or ""hits I missed and one I didnt"" from george jones or check out the new ""those were the days"" by the queen of country dolly parton! johnny is great ,but lets give the living legends some time here!!"
5,Great CDs,"Johnny Cash's country music legacy is hard to capture on two CDs, but these contain his greatest hits. The two CDs are great clean country music at its finest."
5,A great history of Johnny Cash,I found the 2nd disk of this collection to be outstanding. It showed his versatility in style while maintaining his unique distinction. A must have for any collection
4,A Great CD,"I loved this cd and thought for the price it was very good. I enjoyed listening to all the music. There was only one problem with this cd, In the song ""A Boy Named Sue"" they bleeped out a word which I felt ruined the whole song. Other than that I would recommend this purchase to anyone who loves Jhonny Cash and his music."
5,Spot for Toddlers!,"Not only does this book teach the animals, but the block size of the book is great for little hands and also for stacking on top of other block books. One of my 18mth olds favorites!"
5,This band knows what's going on,"If anyone has every done any psychodelic drugs out there (and I know there's a few you that have), you will immediately recognize this band's angle. The album comes in slowly, becomes intense, and leaves as slow and easy as it started. Each song is a new feeling or idea that becomes intense and wrapped up in emotion. The music captures perfectly the pace of life, and how we as humans deal with life. The lyrics are just simply brillant."
3,"Not worth the hype, but still worth a listen...","Like the Strokes, B.R.M.C. suffers from an overdose of hype. I mean, really, what this trio does isn't new - the Jesus & Mary Chain has done this already, and better, on the (woefully out of print in the U.S.) Psychocandy and Darklands. That said, there isn't anybody else doing dark, semi-erotic distortopop - even the Chain gave it up long before they disbanded - and B.R.M.C. does it well. If you yearn for the days when ""Happy When It Rains"" got regular play on your local college radio station, you'll find this record a refreshing listen."
3,"NOT ""LIKE NEW""","I bought the cd advertised as ""LIKE NEW""disc was fine but the jewel case was broken.They should have call it ""CD AS NEW BUT WITH SHATTERED CASE"""
2,The apple does not fall far from the tree,"Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's resemblance to the now defunct band, The Call, reaches crisis proportions in this their first release. This is not to say that it's a terrible thing to be compared to the Call, especially since the father of the bass player for B.R.M.C. is none other than Michael Been, singer and bassist of the Call. And clearly they do not sound like the Call. To my ear, they sound more like watered-down Jesus and Mary Chain. But the production of this debut record is clearly Been-inspired, if not Been-orchestrated. Many of the lyrics on the album harken back to the religious, Christian images presented on the Call's records. Labored melodies wandering aimlessly through strained, moralizing lyrics. The production is too heavy-handed, with assorted studio tricks. But the album's main weakness is the tunes themselves. They all sound contrived and heartless to me. To sum it up: too much affect, too little effect."
1,the world run amok,"I was recommended this album because I like Monk.Sorry, this is not for people who like Monk.Too simplistic and superficial where as Monk is the genius of modern music."
4,Black Rebel Motorcycle Club,"The Black Rebel Motorcycle Club is one of the few gems that gives insight into the monochrome world of black leather and chain smoking romanticism. Born out of the prismatic state if California, the band have been branded many genre titles including neo-psychedelia, garage punk, folk revival, and shoe-gaze. ""B.R.M.C."" is perhaps fans most favorite of album out of the discography. The Japanese version includes three bonus tracks including ""Screaming Gun,""""At My Door,"" and ""Down Here."" The album has reached a familiar popularity that is well recognized by their predecessors such as the Jesus and Mary Chain and the Brian Jonestown Massacre."
4,So What?,"Yeah, it sounds like JAMC. So what? Yeah, it has a Brit-Pop feel to it. So what? Yeah, it's derivitve. So what? It's a damn good album, better than the Strokes, the White Stripes, etc who every other reviewer seems to be name-dropping (no 'cool' points for knowing those bands, people.)It's a good American band doing a good American album - stupid crap punk like Blink 182 and Sum 41 be damned. So, take your JAMC, the Stone Roses comparisons and whoever else you may think they sound like and say to yourself, so what? It's only rock-n-roll but I like it....."
5,speechless...,Ever listen to an album that you had to turn off because it was altering everything you've ever believed so quickly that you couldn't handle it? Yeah...that good.
4,Best Rock Music Currently.,"This is easily one of the best albums I've picked up the past couple years, and despite the recent return of garage rock, ""B.R.M.C."" has filled a void many of those bands couldn't, elements of shoegazing. ""Whatever Happened To My Rock n' Roll [punk song]"" may be the single here, but the rest of this, though similar, is less aggressive, and more fluid and dreamy, especially ""Too Real"" and ""Salvation"". I like the look of these guys too, it matches the music well. As far as originality goes, almost everyone sounds like someone else, and if that's the worst thing about this band, may they rock for many years to come."
2,The wrong pair of shorts is depicted!,"The actual pair of shorts I received were not bad, more like this:Ultra Force Vintage Black Cargo ShortsBut the picture for this item is wrong. There is no Ultra Force Logo, nor any red lining on the internal waist area."
5,"doesn't matter how many stars, it just won't do the justice for this one","part history, part legends, part poetryit is simplely among the best Napoleonic epics which I ever read!RF Delderfield gets A+ for this one.what can I say, the Brits know their enemy, that's why they won the war at the end."
3,PRETTY GOOD STORY FOR HORSELOVERS,THE MOVIE IS PRETTY GOOD. IT FOLLOWED THE ORIGINAL BOOK OK. UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED FOR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD.
3,Richard Grant can't quite carry a script that is too narrow,"This film is one long fantasy indictment of the advertising industry. Sure, as a profession, they do a lot of weird and ridiculous things, so I don't mean to defend it. But to base a whole movie on it? After a while, it is simply over the top. I saw this to see what Grant could do after the incomparable Withnail and I, one of the best black comedies I have ever seen.Grant plays an ad man who is burnt out. Cynical and drinking way too much, he is at that point in his career when he can find something new or plod ahead in a well worn track. He wants to quit, but another part of himself wants to become the essence of the emptiness he perceives at the heart of the profession, manifesting itself in a pretty crude symbolism that I don't want to give away. It is OK and Grant is at times very funny, but he can't make a mediocre and limited script into a great film.Recommended tepidly."
2,"Witty, satirical, and unfunny.","My friend and I rented this thing ages ago after I heard about it on a local radio show from a caller who said it was the funniest film he had ever seen.Richard E. Grant plays dual roles in a film that does little to nothing to entertain. It's a parable about what you need to get ahead in the cut throat world of advertising.Not a film I'd recommend, simply for the fact that the humor is predictable and unfunny.If you must rent it, then stream it for free.Don't say I din't warn you."
1,Zzzzzzzz,"This book is better used as a narcoleptic, as 10 pages in I was snoring like a buzzsaw. The material is presented in the accounts of Mr. Cooke who served in the Civil War as an aide to one of the great generals of the Confederate army. Mr. Cooke's views are understandably distorted by having served and fought for the South. Therefore, this book should not be considered if you are looking for a good first hand historical account of the Civil War. It's literary value is better described by the beauty of its prose - not it's historical context.If you enjoy 19th Century writing this book is for you. If you're looking for personal narrative of the Civil War there are better books available."
3,"OK for the money, not the best","This guitar was ordered for my 6 year old niece. It arrived in good condition, has a nice satin finish, and appears to be built fairly well. The tuners are okay (they click loudly when the strings are brought up to pitch), and the sound is okay. In my opinion, for another $20 or so, the Aria 3/4 size classical which I saw at a local music store is built better, sounds better, has better tuners, and performs just like a full size classical guitar. FYI, I play an Alhambra 8C."
1,Broomfield's depiction of science is both wrong and one-sided,"First, let me be clear that I have only read the Introduction and Chapter 2 (which deals with quantum physics and the ""scientific articles of faith"").Even if I set aside the numerous straw-man arguments the author uses in his attempt to paint science in a bad light I had to come here and mention that his descriptions of the quantum physics is misleading in many places and flat out wrong in a few places. This clearly stems from a lack of understanding on Broomfield's part and it is disappointing that he didn't learn a bit more before trying to speak credibly on the subject.So read this book if you must, but know that the science discussed here is incorrect and that many of the statements made about science itself are caricatures and straw-men.Again... let me be clear that I have not read the entire book and cannot speak to the other parts."
1,Zero stars please,"Please do yourself a favor and look up the lyrics to Village Idiot....Holy crapperson, this is a terrible album. From start to finish it pains me to hear it, and yes I love the experimentation of the Melvins and the punk sensibility of Black Flag. The other reviewer has no business comparing them at all to this steamy turd of an album. Lucky for me, I purchased this album for $0.50 in a crap bin at a local store and traded it for a CD worth $20."
5,Buy and enjoy!!!,"As a long time fan of the movie, this 'Extraordinary Deluxe Three-Disc Edition' is worth the money. The movie is excellent and the extra features are all fun. I would strongly reccomend this whether you are a life long fan, or have never seen it before!"
1,Very Poor Audio Quality for such a good movie,"The title says it all. I was very much looking forwad to watching the Holy Grail which I had not seen in many years. Unfortunately, the sound level was so low, that I could not even watch it.Obviously, I think anyone would agree, Amazon is quite capable of resolving this issue..."
5,Funniest Movie of All Time,"This has got to be among the funniest movies I have ever seen; perhaps even the funniest. The humor is dry in points, and sopping with sarcasm; the wordplay is fantastic; it does have a bit of irreverance, however.This movie makes me want to pay 9 pence for picking up dead relatives, and bang a cat on my laundry!"
2,Not so funny,"People said this was very funny but I did not like it all that much, so maybe its just me."
5,I do believe this is the best movie ever made!,"Monty Python is my favorite movie and for those of you who think this movie is below you or you're too good for it of it wasn't historically accurate, I say Ni to you, ""go boil your bottoms you silly English kkknn..igts! Go watch it, it rocks.:)"
5,Great film,"This was the 2-disc edition, so I definitely got the most ""bang for my buck"" with this product. Good stuff!"
1,Not again ...,"I LOVE this movie. It is one of the funniest movies ever. Consequently, I am desperately tired of new editions coming out every twenty minutes, with minimal special features, hoping to wrest more money from people who went through college saying ""ni"", singing about spam and saying ""burma"" because we panicked. This is the third packaging of this edition of the movie (and I believe fourth DVD release), and the rationale seems to be that there is a tie-in with the highly unnecessary ""Spamalot"" stage show. I cannot fathom why this happens rather than there being, say, something NEW out of five funny men who are still not dead yet. Come on, leave it alone and do something else."
5,"I dont own this DVD but i've seen it about 20,000,000 times",This movie is great. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It'll make you laugh every time you watch it. I love this movie and i think that if u love hilarious movies that this is the movie for you. This movie is no doubt a classic. Later
5,Sing Along with the Monks!,"This is a great DVD with tons of extras, the sing along with the Monks is wonderful, just be careful. The only problem I have with this DVD is I can not find the ""widescreen presentation with pink frilly edges"". My copy has everything else on the disks, and says it has this, but I can not find the widescreen presentation, and I see no pink frilly edges.As for the movie, everyone else has said it all. :-)"
3,Not quite great edition,"Well, the movie is awesome, the second DVD is awesome, all the little extras on both DVDs are great. Of course the film is grainy and such, it was meant to be that way.Now, this version is not as good as another. The Extraordinarily Deluxe Edition. It has the DVD and the second DVD. It also includes the old album that was released of the film ow on CD. It is packaged nicely (it looks better than this version).I think it is kewl that they were adding in the Script, but it is already on the DVD itself. Plus if you just google, you can find it online very easily. So it really isn't worth it to have it included for this much. The Extraordinarily version is the one I recommend. It's packaging looks much better as well as aranged better, it has the extra cd, and it costs less. With the money you save, you can get some coconuts and play along with the movie."
5,MUST HAVE!!!,"If you've never seen Monty Python before, this is the definitive starting point to all their movies. Actually, they are all great and I have a hard time deciding which one is my favorite, but this one is tops... If you are already a Monty Python fan and don't already own this, what are you waiting for??? For those who lack a funny bone, dislike tasteless humor or can't understand British Comedy, stick to Comedy Central, you can't be helped here."
1,problems take away from film enjoyment,Monty Python's Holy Grail is a great movie but the DVD problems take the fun out of watching. The subtitles cannot be turned off no matter how many times you go to the subtitle menu and turn them off. For this reason I recommend you do not buy this DVD until this problem is fixed. I feel I wasted my money. Why invest in DVDs if they have glitches? There are plenty of other Python DVDs to enjoy.
5,Sir not appearing in this picture.,"This is from 1-5 stars a 6,this is flawless comedyown it,own it,own it.Why John Cleese us americansprefer this over life of brian...BECAUSE IT'S SILLY!Buy this with UP IN SMOKE & YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN youare set for life my friend."
1,WHERE IS THE GILLIAM COMMENTARY?,I LOVED this movie BUT one of the things that's really neat about DVD is the secondary audio track(see GODZILLA or The Matrix)of director/editors comments... It is a must for those that love a movie.... Now Gillium and Jones did a running commentary on there masterpiece in about 1978(I beleive it appeared on the old 'laserdisk' system.).... SO WHERE IS IT? ...... SO>>>>> for that reason >>>I CANT RECCOMEND BUYING THIS DVD! why spend the extra money for this dvd ... (they made it on a shoestring so the audio and video are terrible) I'm waiting for the REAL DVD version that will incorporate this audio track.
4,Best British import since Tanqueray Gin!,"Who can make a better comedic spoof of the King Arthur legend than the British themselves? John Cleese, Eric Idle, and the rest of the Python gang submit brilliant comic performances in this funny, entertaining, albeit bloody at times, motion picture that fans on both sides of the North Atlantic have come to appreciate."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Romanced all out of proportion, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has its funny and effective moments but quickly runs out of steam and creativity; many people like it but it's certainly no great movie."
5,Pure Genius!,"Brother Maynard, bring forth the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioc!There are so many unforgettable one-liners and subtle spoofs in this movie, that any true fan of comedic cinema would be a fool not to include this in his / her collection. Now, ""have at you!""Get it. Now."
5,"If this was a king, I'd vote for him","The transfer was very well done, it was of a higher definition than the DVD, especially the sound quality. If you don't have a DVD of this, definitely get this. If you do have the DVD, you'd still be better off considering to get this than refusing all together."
5,"I give it 5 coconuts (African swallow, not European)","This movie is the best movie that has been, or will ever be made. If you don't like it, something is VERY wrong with you and you should see a doctor."
1,Not The DVD Shown in Picture - Misleading-,"I saw this in the store but thought I would order it from amazon , the picture shows the dvd version like I saw in the store and said extroardinarily deluxe two-disc edition (it did say that, but not anymore) now I have to pay more than I would have in the store cause I paid shipping to get here and now I have to pay to ship back then go buy it from store , two payments of shipping for nothin'. Agrivating."
3,I liked it but........,"THE STORY:King arthur must get the holy grail. why we dont know. use your imagoation. He recurits knights and has hilaruois adventuours along the way.HOW IT WAS:It was ok. I liked this PARTICULAR monty python , but most of them make fun of chrstains which I am. This ones a great buy but dont get any others.THE DVD:The picture ucked and the sound was scartchy but the speical features were funnier than the movie itself.IN CON CON IM DONE:buy it but not the others."
1,Not Very Funny,"I really hated this movie and am sorry I bought it. I tried to give it away to friends and family and they all said, ""No."" I would like my money back...but it is opened...so I guess it goes to Salvation Army!"
5,This is one of the best !,"Out of all the various US made/produced DVDs, this DVD has the best video transfer. Besides the video/audio quality, the animation is great. The story resembles that of Lupin the 3rd. The anime has good story lines, great characters, humor, action, mecha...but most of all, this show has style...which is further reinforced by the jazz/blues soundtrack. If you are not into giant robots and pokemon, this is the one for you. It's very, very enjoyable."
5,comfortable strap,"I'm pleased with the strap. It's well made and comfortable, even around my neck with a camera and big glass. I also like that the padded part of the strap can be unclipped to make it less intrusive on a tripod."
2,Wrong Color,"My wife liked the look of the WINE strap. The dang thing is RED... sooo ugly. What else can I say, is that twenty words yet?"
1,Awful,This DVD was the worst I have seen. The sound and video were not in sync. The song In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida would not play. After 10 seconds it would loop back to the start of the song. The key player was a moron. The guitar player was also terrible. Do not waste your money on this DVD!
2,Trying out Sony Vegas,"All I can say is this; I installed the program and when I tried to use it, I could not get it to do what I wanted which was to run thru a V.H.S.home movie that I had recorded onto D.V.D. and remove some unwanted segments. It seemed to only want to remove the beginning or the end, so I have uninstalled it for the time being. I tried to follow the book of instructions. perhaps I need a greater intelligence. SorryJ.B"
2,Memories of this was better than the actual recordings,I had thought this was going to be better than it was. I had remembered it from way back and was looking forward to hearing it. But I was mistaken! Rhonstadt's voice is certainly not classic or disciplined enough for soft complicated sounds like these songs demand. Too bad.
1,"Awful ""teen"" book","Not only is this book poorly written, it is completely inappropriate. Don't be fooled by this supposedly Christian teen fiction book. It is full of sexual innuendo, joking and descriptions. The girl may come to Christ in the end, but in the meantime you have to wade through a lot of junk. Maybe appropriate for a novel aimed at adults, but not for one aimed at teens. I am appalled that I have allowed my daughter to read any of Melody Carlson's books in the past. I wrongly assumed they would be morally acceptable."
5,so great!,This machine is so great..I am getting the ooh's and aah's... and support from reseller is incredible!
1,Good Concept - Too Bad They Leak,"This is a nice, sturdy glass bottle, with a spring clasp and a wire hanger. The problem is, the tube has a ball bearing type stopper that leaks when you invert the bottle into the cage drinking position. Apparently, there is a manufacturing defect. Perhaps the tube is at the wrong angle to allow the stopper to prevent leaking. When in the fully upright position, the entire contents will eventually leak out, a drop at a time. That is not acceptable. I bought two and both had the same problem, so I returned them. It is a very nice design; it is a shame this problem exists."
1,"Works well at first, then.....","I thought these bottles were a terrific idea--i bought 3 of them for my guinea pig--and the worked really well at first--but not for long. I did not find that they dripped--in fact quite the opposite. After a while of washing these everyday, the metal tube becomes detached from the cap. I thought it wasn't a problem--I mean--you can just stick it back in. But for some reason that I cannot figure out, it stops giving water after my cavy's first sip. After every drink--I had to shake the bottle in order to get it working again. I've tried putting the tube back in loosely, tightly, and everything in between--nothing helps. I have switched to the lixit glass bottles and she is soooo much happier. Hopefully--they will continue to work."
5,Asian Cooking,"This is a wonderful product!Weighs a ""ton"" and that is GOOD! Solid granite, what can I say! Have been using it more each day. Great addition to my home cooking and style of cooking.WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY!"
2,"Great brush, poor switch",Cleans nicely though I don't have enough experience to compare it to other power brushes. On/off switch did not work (even after some fiddling) so I open the battery compartment to turn it off.
4,I don't know.,"I bought this for $1 at my job. (My first battery operated toothbrush.) My first time using its kind and using this one, my teeth did feel cleaner. I only use the brush at night since I'm tired and want to get in bed after work and to me, it does the job. Big negative: no replacement heads to be found ANYwhere."
1,Brinkman offers no customer support,This light broke the first time i took it out. Brinkman's customer support would not sell me a replacement globe and after there dismissive customer service this is the last one of there products i will buy.
3,okay read if you're bored,"I have read many books of the genre; ""Sarai,"" ""The red Tent,"" ""Women of grace,"" etc. I enjoy reading biblical fiction, especially about women of the bible. So, I was looking forward to reading the story of this often overlooked woman.I was extremely dissapointed. The book does not develop characters, its as if halfway thru writing this the author lost his passion for telling the story of Zipporah. It switches viewpoint, some of its written in first person and other parts its told from an objective view. Most impotantly though, the author seems to focus so much on race and its ugliness that he never expresses the strength and faith Zipporah had to have in order to remain the wife of such a great man as Moses.I would not recomend this as a read to others, I think their is other Christian fiction that would better serve your timeplease visit me at BookDevour@blogspot.com"
4,Good value for the price,"I am in a book group that is reading the trilogy. This book was used and was offered for only a penny. It was a little worn around the edges and stained, but for a penny, it was a good value. I don't plan on keeping it forever."
4,"Heartfelt,Moving,a book to make you ponder","Lorrie Moore is a great talent. She has written a bookthat is both moving and stimulates an appreciation for herinsight and creativity. Who Will Run the Frog Hospital is acoming of age novel with many deep commentaries on howrelationships develop and disolve. It is a book about life,change, loss and the situation of mankind. You can followan awkward teenager who discovers herself and develops aprofound awareness of her life and situation."
5,Another Ludlum Blockbuster,"The Bourne Supremacy is the second in the Bourne Trilogy. Robert Ludlum has captured the scenery of China to a masterpiece of danger, excitement, and thrills during every page of this book.Jason Bourne, a paid assassin is back in China. Or is he? A man who still is not quite sure who he is goes to China and murders begin to happen. Could Jason be the killer? Or is there another Jason Bourne? Or maybe even a different murderer who wants everybody to think Jason is the killer?This is definitely an excellent sequel, and I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the first one."
3,good writing but why sooooo long?!,ludlum's writing is good but reading pleasure spoiled by length of this novel - got bored after some 300 pages
3,MLM is not the only option!,"I get tired of these MLM people that claim their way is the only way to financial freedom. What about Peter Lynch? He got his financial freedom by investing in the stock market, and am sure he has more financial freedom than many MLM people.Another thing that MLM won't tell you is that there is risk involved with MLM as there is in any business enterprise. As a distributor you can get terminated, your downline could quit either because they or lazy or they found a better MLM opportunity.MLM is one option to be self employed, but not money that you can live on. Some MLM people I know are on the road all the time with MLM, so it's a lot harder than some of them will tell you that it is."
3,Missing text!,"The kindle version of this book has annoying lapses in the text, most notably in what might be italicized. A typical case might be ""the letter read:"" and the text of the letter is missing! Some of the missing can be guessed at, but some instances cause a major loss of context."
4,Awesome exept for...,"Great pocket book if you are learning UML , some diagrams are a bit difficult to read, too much compressed."
4,Great Guitar Music,"This album comes with a very good selection of music, some rare. The instrumental accompaniment to the guitar is very rich and sensual.Worth every cent of your hard-earned dollar."
3,"good, but repetitive","After hearing Oster the first time, I was intrigued. The album is very repetitive, but good for background music."
5,Why the Possum's Tail is Bare,Why the Possum's Tail is Bare arrived in a timely manner. The condition was as stated. I would buy from them again.
5,Very handy inverter,"I really like the part that you can adjust the sensitivity so the inverter only comes on when the refrigerator wants to start and doesn't have to be on all the time. Really saves on batteries. I bought mine to keep the furnace, refrigerator and freezers working during the power outages and so far it has worked very well for over a year. It is very easy to connect up and has been the best back up power inverter I have had to keep the appliances running. Being modified sine wave though, it doesn't work well on devices with CPU's and such like some phones, clock radios, cable boxes and DVD players so I have a nice small pure sine wave unit for them."
3,Saling to the MAX,It was a good read. I would have liked more ditail about the saling and navigation daily rotine. This man was a great salor.
4,Ships Log but a non-sailor can get into it.,"Found out about Moitessier by watching the Deep Water documentary and found him more interesting than any of the other individuals in the race. The book is really his ships log/journal from the Gold Cup. It has many technical references but has an appendix and glossary for the non-sailor.I really enjoyed it. You get to watch Moitessier come to the realization, and perhaps quite abruptly, that he's not going home.I do have to say though that I got a but confused at the ending of the log. His time in Tahiti? I get what he was trying to say, I just think perhaps that section should have been a bit more thoroughly edited."
5,Best sailing book ever!!!,"This was one of the most inspiring books I've ever read. After speaking to many people about what good ""adventure"" books they'd read, many people recommended this one. I was impressed... The author is very good at putting the reader on the deck of the boat and really getting the reader involved with the story. It's hard to imagine sailing around the world much less doing it alone. I forgot I was reading non-fiction at times. I couldn't put the book down and recommend it as required reading for anyone of you adventure seekers out there."
3,Was popular in 1983,"Worth owning for a taste of the sort of films that Hollywood released in droves in 1983. I admit I didn't love it when I first saw it then, because I expected more. And apparently the ""more"" should have been in it. That's right, this film was cut considerably then, so much so that Jacqueline Bissett felt the cut film did not portray her in the light she wanted. The end product sees her as a scathing nympho with no respect for anyone.Hopefully, MGM will see fit to re-release this on DVD with the deleted scenes."
1,i dont have recent purchses,"i told you before never arrive me this movie, also steve irwin and flag of our fathers.can you please understand????????????? i dont have the movies, and is de thousand time that i told you, the mexican costumer doesent know eanything about it. so please cancel all my orders and refound all my money back inmediatly"
2,Not what it's supposed to be,"I was very excited when I got this, but when I tried to add my people into the sims 2, the heads turned out not looking right and just didn't look normal. I'm warning you, this is not what it supposedly is. But of course, if you just want to make 3-d models of your family and friends, it's perfect for that, but if you want it for the sims 2 like I did, your wasting your time here."
4,Hannah's rowdy Southern fiction kicks butt!,"One of many Mississippi writers to achieve high respect (at least by critics and peers) is Barry Hannah, author of eleven titles. His latest, High Lonesome, finds him reasserting himself as a master of the short story. The thirteen tragic and oddly funny tales range from ""Get Some Young"", in which an old shopkeeper and his wife become more than friends with an ""almost too good-looking"" boy, to ""The Agony of T. Bandini"", where the main trouble-maker is possibly a closeted homosexual and insists that ""Everybody is just a collision."" Hannah's style is as flashy as ever if not less brutal as his past work. His subject matter circles around eccentric oldsters, drunks, wannabe musicians, war vets, and wimpy geeks. At times it's like a southern Tom Robbins, which can sometimes not work, but mostly does. Barry Hannah does it again. And again. And again..."
5,Poor Jessi!!!,"It's the Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa time, (AGAIN,) for the BSC and Jessi decides to educate the BSC's sitting charges about Kwanzaa by putting on a play based on the old African legend Malindy Meets the Devil, (or something like that.) But then tragedy strikes. While Jessi is riding in the car with her Aunt, younger sister Becca and her baby brother Sqwirt, they get involved in a car crash, resulting in young Sqwirts head injury. Jessi starts to think that her Holidays are ruined, but are they?"
2,STILL WAITING TO LAUGH,"The good? This is a GREAT documentary (albeit incomplete) about people in the history of ""funny business"".The bad? This is NOT funny. Granted, the clips shown would normally be funny in their own right, but having seen them 2 or more times makes them just not very funny anymore. And time doesn't allow COMPLETE skits to be shown.If you want a good documentary of past comics, buy this one.If you're looking for a bunch of laughs, forget it."
5,History of Comedy DVD,"If you like PBS documentaries, then you're gonna love this. Very entertaining & educational. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes comedy, and is interested in the history of comedy in America. You'll be smiling the whole way though it."
4,Great Cover,This cover is great as a dust cover for my bikes. I currently have a Road King Custom and a Electra Glide Ultra Limited. The only drawback is I have to remove my antennas from my ultra.
2,Shaver head cutters,"Don't get these.My shaver is 4 years old and I replaced the cutters and foil two years ago. Lately I decided to replace them again with these new ones.These new ones cut much worse than the old ones.SO bad, in fact, that I went back to the old ones.I would recommend just getting a new shaver."
3,FAIR,I WOULD NEVER BUY IT FROM GOODMAN'S DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY SENT ME GENERIC BUT I BOUGHT PANASONIC. THEY HAD A PIC OF PANASONIC AND SENT GENERIC. I WOULD NOT BUY FROM THEM ANYMORE
5,Easy to install,Very easy to remove the existing blades and replace them with the new ones. Made a huge difference in the quality of the shave
1,Panasonic blade,"This item was purchased from Goodman's. Using Panasonic's name and part number I thought I was purchasing an original replacement blade not a generic. I was wrong, I had to dig back thru trash can to retrieve old blades because the blades I purchased were terrible. I returned explaining the problem. Recieved credit for blades, did not recieve credit for shipping charges. I think Goodman's and Amazon should have credited freight because item sold never claimed to be generic."
1,Contradictory,"I wrote a review for this book once already, complete with the points I found necessary to give it a one star. I am not rethinking that diatribe, so here is the short:Any book written to debunk such a critical aspect of civilization had better be careful to not slip up any where in its pages. But this ""professor"" can't do it. He contradicts himself, not just with the denouncement of the arts, but also when he brings in religion. So he doesn't just shoot himself in the foot with ignorance, he castrates himself too! It would be humorous, but I wasted several days of reading a book that I expected to be a good philosophical argument against something I believe in; the arts, only to find I was reading a book written by a man whose college course I would drop out of for a lack of reasonable information."
4,replacement unit,Purchased as replacements for the original inverter supplied with the Thermo-King TriPac APU. Can not afford the Thermo-King units so we purchase these... just as good at less than half the price!!
4,Read the Title - Title's Descibe Content Within,"Having coding experience in Dreamweaver 2004 and recently upgrading to DW8 I anxiously awaited the release of Rachel's (the books author) book entitled 'Build Your Own Standards Compliant Website using Dreamweaver 8'. My background in code design prior to 2005 was that of a ""what ever works"" or rather to quote a recent Apprentice lackey, ""Fake it till you make it"" In 2005 - standards, compliance and validity matter and will so if your site design is to last the coming revolution. This book helps you do just that! If you are fumbling through validating and understanding basic HTML/XHTML structure, this book is for you!"
4,John Deere Loader,I got this for our grandson who is 3 years old and he just loves it. I was very happy with the solid construction and the chain drive.The colors are vibrant and with the decals it looks like the real deal.Shipment was prompt and overall a good experience.
1,the shipping is ridiculous its as much as the bed!!!!!!!!!!,i have tried everything to buy this bed for my little boy.i refuse to pay 165.00 on shipping for a bed that costs 199.00.maybe if you sold it in stores not just on line maybe more people would purchase it. all the reviews i have read are from people who want the bed but also refuse to pay that price.
1,"Cute Bed, High Shipping!","I experienced shipping problems and decided to order directly from the manufacturer, Step2, at an extremely lower rate. I have contaced Amazon about the outrageous shipping costs on more than one occasion and wish they would investigate ways to lower it. I think they're losing business over this. Unfortunately, our local Toys R Us does not place personal orders for customer pick up at their location so we weren't able to get the bed that way either."
2,Get for 260.00 at local ToysRUs...no ship/no order,I checked all over and refused to pay the outrageous shipping charges Even when some charged 199.00 it was still cheaper to purchase it at ToysRus for 260.00. I called they had them or get them in their shipments every week. Picked up at local store....no shipping fee...and got 10.00 discount promo (babiesRus...toddler furniture?)Reminds me of the old firebird autos. Google for others who ship for 60.00. Good luck.
3,Not thrilled!,"I recently bought the stock car bed for my almost 2 year old son. To get him out of our bed, we thought a racecar bed would do the trick. And it did! He absolutely loves his big boy bed. However, my husband and I were not happy trying to put the bed together. The pieces do not fit tight. The back end does not fit at all. I wanted to return the bed, but our son had a fit. So my husband rigged it together. So, if I had to buy it again for my son, I probably would. He loves it sooo much. But I am upset that we paid all of that money, and the bed doesn't fit together properly. Oh well, the smile on his face makes it worth every penny."
4,I've Been Looking for this Book!,"I am an artist and painting teacher working in oils, which I love. But, increasingly, I have students who want to paint in acrylics. There aren't that many books out there on the subject, but this clearly explains how to paint in acrylics and achieve the fine art look of oils. It goes beyond, and shows what acrylics can do that oils can't. This book covers all of the basics that a good book or teacher covers ... color, temperature, value, edges and design. ""Capturing Light in Acrylics"" should be on every acyrlic painter's shelf."
4,Humor Doesn't Grow On Trees,"This is a review for EASY MONEY (1981)directed by James Signorelli.In order to inherit ten million from his mother-in-law's estate, free living Monty Capuletti must completely reform himself within one year. No more smoking, drinking, gambling and doing the other things that Monty thinks make life worthwhile. Along with the usual difficulties one faces in reforming oneself, Monty has to deal with his mother-in-law's family and their sneering attitude towards him and his lifestyle.EASY MONEY is a pretty funny film although without Rodney Dangerfield & Joe Pesci it wouldn't be nearly half as amusing. A pretty decent modern comedy with a large portion of class and ethnic humor thrown in for good measure.I think that EASY MONEY is worth seeing at least once or twice.Four Stars."
3,Missing Scene ?,"Why they cut out the boxing match scene from the DVD is beyond me.This film captures Rodney D at his peak of popularity and comic genius, a true original! Joe Pesci and the entire supporting cast are also fantastic.But to cut a major scene out of the film is just criminal!Movie 5 stars, DVD has no extras & deleted scene = 3 stars"
4,Rodney at His Best,This is by far the best movie Rodney Dangerfield has ever made. This is the only movie where the other characters in the movie are just as important as he is. Not only that but the supporting cast has Joe Pesci in his prime.
2,Damaged Goods,I received two DVDs in a recent order. Both were significantly damaged and could not be played. One was replaced and a replacement was not available for the second DVD. May look elsewhere for upcoming DVD purchases.
4,Missing Scene,Why is this movie missing the dream sequence where he is in the boxing ring? This was a great scene. There are parts of it in the trailer and a picture of it on the insert. I have not seen this scene in years. I bought the DVD hoping that the scene was restored but sadly it was not. That's why this only got 4 stars.
4,does what its supposed to,"just got a ps3 and wanted to see what the blu-ray big deal was. this dvd led to me buying another dvd, and it was cheap, so i guess it did what it was supposed to. it was kind of irritating to try to watch the fireplace video, in that it kept changing views and ruining the illusion of a fireplace in my tv, but i guess it could've done worse for the price."
4,Memorable characters on a classic journey,"I have never been a big fan of David Weber's solo books, but I really liked this team-up with John Ringo. Roger Ramius is one of the most memorable SF characters I've read in a long time and I thoroughly enjoyed his debut in March Upcountry. It's a classic adventure tale in Science Fiction clothing."
2,"Buy it used, its not worth paying full price.","Basically, as another reviewer has already pointed out, this book is Xenophon meets Captains Courageous. In this case, the whole is much less than the sum of its parts. The plot is utterly predictable, the writing mediocre, character development nil (Ok, Ok, who buys lousy SciFi for character development anyway?) and the blood and gore insanely high. AND the book ends in the middle! Buy March to the Sea to find out how it ends! I probably will buy it but not retail!I would suggest, if you haven't already read them, Pournelle's earlier Falkenberg books as being much better examples of the military SciFi genre (however, steer clear of his collaborations with S. M. Stirling--much weaker entries). Or for that matter, you could pick up the first few of the Honor Harrington series (esp. Basilisk Station)."
3,"Yummy, Another one from the Master!","This is so different from the usual Miltary Sci-Fi! The ""toots"" or databases everyone carries is new standard equipment for a future soldier.As usual Weber creates a fantastic world one wishes one could travel to. I like the soldiers, but I'm really disappointed with the body count which is why it only gets 3 stars.Looking forward to the next installment."
1,DVD by ESPN Productions,Be wary of the bad language if you are thinking about puchasing this item. It is inappropriate for many people.
4,Great Book,"Seriously, I had to write this review because of all the people who gave it such a low rating. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. Ok there may be a few things wrong with the book. I wouldn't mind a few pictures here and there. However, to say that the whole book is terrible is a bit extreme. I have a bunch of cookbooks and this is the one I continually go back to to compare recipes. I sold baked good at a farmers market and his Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies got rave reviews. He also gives so many options on a way to change a recipe. Like his cheescake. He gives you a way to light it up or make a dense one. He troublshoots each recipe in case something did go wrong. Very good book."
4,Good strings,The shipping was fast. These are durable strings. The only drawback is that I feel the sound is somehow dull because of the coating.
4,Great strings for my Ovation Celebrity.....,"You cannnot go wrong with Elixir accoustic guitar strings. Taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another. However, you cannot go wrong with those strings. I highly recommend them. I like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings I have tried."
5,Great Strings,"I am a beginner guitar player, so I don't have too much experience with different types of strings. But, I can say that when compared to the stock strings of my Fender Acoustic guitar, these things are like night and day. A much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers. Highly recommended."
2,Way too big,"I'm a superman fan and I bought this keychain thinking it was a reasonably sized chique silver-ish Superman 3D keychain... Turns out it is really huge, making it harder to fit the keys into my pants... Also, it's not anywhere as shiny as it is in the photo. Finally, the silver shade is a lot darker and dimmer than the one the image suggests."
1,I have a question,I have a question about this product. It arrived fine and appears to be the original Santa Fe cologne - but the top of the bottle appears to be missing. There is just a hole where it looks like the sprayer should go. Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,High priced,This is a average pizza pan not what everyone said that it was. After I recieved this pan I was in a kitchen supply store I found the very same pan that had a different lable on it for only $9.99 plus tax. I paid almost twice that price for the pan and the shipping cost. I worked many years at Wear-Ever Aluminum Co. which manufactured cookware and I can tell cookware that is exactly alike and manufactured by the same company. This pizza pan that I purchaced did not have Calphalon stamped on it anywhere. If you are wanting to purchace this pan because you think that it is a Calphalon peice NOT!! Look around before you purchace this pan. FYI
5,TOO BIG,"If you want to make your pizza from scratch and like a crispy crust this pan is for you. There are tiny holes in it. I was just looking for a pan that would cook quality ""doctored"" frozen pizza because my old pan wore out. This pan doesn't work out for me because sometimes i like a softer crust. And, it is huge! You also can't cut the pizza on this surface. On the upside, it is really slippery so the pizza slides right off to a cutting surface. I gave it a five because if used as intended, it is a great pan."
2,"sadly, it breaks easily","it was good while it lasted, after 30 days or so,one day while trying to pull the cellphone out, it just snap and broke. it's not a very strong material and it doesn't protect the cellphone 'that' much."
3,Quick intro,"This is good quick primer but if you have already purchased a few other books, there's no need for this one."
1,Wonderful Heartfelt Relationship,"The title made me pick this book up, but the story is why I am smitten with these characters. Tommy's relationship with Kendra proceeded as I would have written it; the way I wanted it to progress. What I didn't know was that my heart would break as I read on. Wonderfully written."
2,Not worth buying,This CD isn't very good--the only song I enjoyed was Cowboy Junkie's Sweet Jane (which is awesome).Don't waste your money!
4,Girlfriend made me watch it.....,"I am am glad she did. Not only should ""women everywhere"" be inspired by the valor the women potray in this movie, but men should be inspired as well. Based on a true story, this movie will truely entertain, and make you realize that not only men fight wars. (Plus it should get a few ""good guy"" points from your girlfriend!!)"
3,"Nice read, but lacking in real suspense","This is the second book I've read by Freedman. I read Against the Wind several years ago, and it is one of my favorite books and got me interested in the legal-thriller. House of Smoke is a nice read, but doesn't keep you ""on the edge of your seat"". Sometimes the author dwells on irrelevant details too much, especially in describing foods. Overall a decent book, but not a major thriller."
1,Just more GARBAGE,"Another bore-ring story about the super wealthy (20,000 acre cattle ranch in Santa Barbara County, Calif.). Only this time with a rude, crude, insensitive female PI.. Personally I can not relate to the wealthy ....I have absolutly no synpathy (boohoo) for them and can care less if they live or die.Against the Wind is Freedmans ONLY good book."
2,"It was generic one, not the real Panasonic bag.","I thought I will receive the real Panasonic bag. But it was the generic one. There are big differences! 1) The ring part was not made with rubber. 2) The bag it self is really thin and cheap. So be careful when you order! Make sure to check if its made by Panasonic or not!!! If they are $6 for 3 bags, they are NOT original Panasonic bags."
4,Really great religous/spritual book,I hadn't read any of Father Berrigan's writings before but really fell in love while reading this. While he does pontificate it is really relatable to the layman as well. I highly recommend
3,An oldy but a goody.,"Having just had a Martin Cruz Smith re-reading jag I wanted to see the old movie of the ""Gorky Park"" book. I'm always a bit cautious about internet purchases but I found the Amazon people delivered a perfect, new DVD of the film in a very short space of time, something that would have been difficult to achieve in my local DVD shops.The movie is still worth a look with good performances from William Hurt and Lee Marvin as the nasty American tycoon and the somewhat neurotic (but of course wildly romantic!) Soviet policeman. The brooding darkness of the Russian winter/spring is well captured and there are some good action sequences, especially around the sable farm at the end. I had a good time comparing the film version to the book and pondering what had been left out and why."
4,Not the best place to start with Chesterton,"Chesterton wrote a great deal of fiction and nonfiction, and his nonfiction covers all sorts of topics including religion, literature, biography, and-as here-the social, political, and philosophical issues facing England at the beginning of the twentieth century. As an American at the beginning of the twenty-first century, I did find some of the references dated, obscure, or irrelevant; but there is still plenty here that is worth reading and thinking about.I would not recommend this as an introduction to Chesterton, as it has not aged as well as some of his other works. But the Chesterton afficionado should not hesitate. GKC's unique style, wit, and insight are in full force here."
2,His Dissipated Dam Life,"I love the Netherlands. I lived there and my two sons were born there, over 40 years ago. I am always homesick for Amsterdam and visit as often as I can. I wanted to enjoy this book for those reasons, but in fact I didn't. I was annoyed with the author's contemptuous, cynical attitude toward the city and the people. So I skipped through it, reading only a page or two, every 20 pages or so.The best I can say is that I did find some of the stories amusing and some of the satire grounded in recognizable truth, but the author's self-identified wastrel life style was off-putting. However, I'm now a grandmother and he is a young man. So perhaps if you are an urbane, cynical young person you might find the book amusing. I didn't."
3,Good premise but wordy and dry in most parts,"To begin, I agree with the author's premise. The reasoning that liberals use is faulty, and the author goes to great pains to show this using psychological theories. But most of the book gets bogged down in this and is difficult to read. It's a 400 page book, and the lines seem close together so that each page is quite dense. The author takes a rather academic tone. Sample several pages if you're able to by using Amazon's sampler. This is not your usual political book charged with colloquial rhetoric.Aside from the long stretches of dry reading (which I admittedly glossed over), there are a few parts that were strong. These parts tended toward bullet points. If you have a strong interest in psychology (some Erikson fellow is cited repeatedly) do give this book a look. If you're wanting the book from a political perspective you should evaluate your desire to read a scholarly dissection of modern liberals. Neutral recommendation overall."
1,The Conservative Mind: ( ),"Notice that there's nothing in parentheses. That's the conservative mind. It's empty. It's blank. Conservatives don't have minds. They are brainless. They lack the capability to think critically...or even think at all.I'm only writing simple sentences in this review. That way, the brainless conservatives can understand."
1,Back to Medicine - Yikes!,"I think this book would have been more credible if the author had left his M.D. credential at the door. This book is just rhetoric, not science. It isn't philosophy - no original thinking or fundamental tension present at all. The author needs a good course in systems philosophy.It just scares me to think that this guy might be practicing medicine somewhere. Hopefully this book is selling like hotcakes and he doesn't have to practice."
1,Pop Psychology Meets Cognitive Dissonance,"This book is just silly and every argument he makes can easily be attributed to every Fictional Conservative I've ever met From his Nanny State BS (What do you call spending half our budget on our Military Nanny?) to his playing the victim (Gee it's not our fault no WMDs were found,Not our fault planeloads of cash are unaccounted for, not our fault 300,000 weapons are missing in Iraq)Well you get the point, save your money and if you want to hear poorly argued Pop Psychology with a Rightwingnut twist just turn on your AM radio .."
4,Great stand for a Green Cheek Conure,"I bought this stand with the intention of using it as a portable stand for our Green Cheek Conure. I wanted something small enough to bring around the apartment with me so I could put our bird on it when I am doing things. It is great because it's proportionate to his size, and the bowl detaches rather easily for cleaning. It's made well, although seems a little on the cheap side for the price paid.Overall this is a good deal for what you get in a portable stand. There certainly aren't many stands like it, which is why I chose this one since it seemed to be the best fit for my needs."
5,Good Quality Hat,Suprisngly good quality hat and comfortable fitting despite the low price - no need to pay the hgher price for other Mets hats.
3,works for us,"something to replace moms 50year old pair. bigger than i wanted, swaller than mom expected, just about right and the handles dont bind, a big plus."
3,myths of mexico,I found this very interesting and gave an adequate overview of the various myths of mexico but left me wanted to know more...which is not a bad thing.
3,wounded soldier,"i ordered this cd to listen to ONE song. the cd arrived promptly and in great condition. However, if you're looking for the song, ""wounded soldier"" you'll only get the instrumental. I can't find the song anywhere. I was disappointed that the cd only included the instrumental version of the song. maybe in the future, you could list the tracks on the cd so i'll see exactly what i'm getting."
5,This is One Giant Cock Bowl! Great Value & Quality!,"Last year, it was the Royal Doulton s&p; shakers, this year I bought Grandma this lovely matching rooster bowl. I was very pleasantly surprised to see how enormous it was when it arrived. The bowl is very heavy, but sturdy, and makes a gorgeous table centerpiece for a cock-themed kitched.Grandma was so happy and she thought I spent a fortune on this beauty. If she only knew it was more than 75% off retail... I think I'm her favorite grandchild now."
3,Not my favorite one...,"This one has alot of flute in it which I wasn't aware of. Her ""Season's of the soul"" cd is her best, I think. If you like flute, you will like this one."
2,Disappointed,I bought two of these hats recently because I ordered one that was 7 1/8 but it was too small so I reordered a 7 1/4. I noticed on the 1/8 cap that it was made in China and it felt different from this 1/4 I received but the 1/4 one doesn't have a made in 'X' label on it. The 1/4 also feels slightly nicer but also rougher along the edges and its uncomfortable on my ears. After only 2 days of having the cap the color is already starting to fade so I have to question its authenticity and if what I am buying online are quality products or just cheap knock offs. I assume always that I get what I paid for but I am not so sure anymore if that is the case... I wish I could return this one that I am wearing now except that I've already taken all the labels and stickers off so I assume they won't accept it back. I'm pretty disappointed with this hat and I probably will be buying from stores now.
5,Nuclear Message is right on key!,"Mr. Agarwal's analysis is superb. As a graduate of Franklin & Marshall, he gained an unique Western perspective which he effectively utilizes in his critique of current Indian nuclear aspirations. He brings a common sense approach to the problem, and rejects the usual pro or anti-Western bias, and is a strong proponent of the 1997 B.L.O.G. action proposal.It is all the more saddening, considering Mr. Agarwal's detailed knowledge of Indian nuclear policy, that his contribution has fallen on deaf ears in the foreign policy community. Perhaps recent events in Afghanistan will allow Mr. Agarwal to re-enter the nuclear policy arena, despite his more recent contribution to - of all things - internet music space."
2,The Thief of Always,"I was very disappointed when my copy of The Thief of Always arrived because I was expecting the novel, NOT the graphic novel. The graphic novel will interest a challenged reader but that is not what I was looking for to put in my library."
5,Awesome Book!!!,"The Thief of Always by Clive barker is an excellent fantasy story that is suitible for everyone. I love this book. It's about a boy named Harvey who is bored and is tired with his life until a goblin like creature invites him to stay at the Holiday House where fun and games never end. But when Harvey discovers all of the deepest secrets among the house, he is frightened. Harvey most of all discovers that kids who come in never go out! This thrilling yet great story drags you into an armchair and never lets you put down the book, so read it!"
4,Clive Barker's best work!,"A fun read. Good for both the kids and the occasional adult. Cliver Barker would do well to use this book as a template. Leave out the kids and all of the weirdo freaky ""Great and Secret Show"" type stuff and you have yourself a Top Seller."
2,Clive Barker's The Thief of Always...,This book is a decent book for those 14 and under. I'm 16 and read it as it was recomended to me by my brother. I found the plot to be predictable and somewhat boring. I found otherwise obvious ideas were explained and oversimpilfied. The ending was nothing overly exciting... The book didn't do it for me. Recomended only for those under 14 or so... subba?
4,Not a substitute for the book but a great aid,"I owned this film on video and then purchased the DVD when it became available. The DVD has not been enhanced and the picture quality is not great. However, I think it is still worth buying for the quality of the acting performances - Milo O'Shea IS Bloom - and the fact that it is filmed on location in Dublin - although some of the scenes are not placed in the original Joyce locations. It is of course a seriously curtailed version of the novel - it would have to be to fit into two hours - and does not in any way substitute for a reading of the original. Much of the symbolism and historical references of the inner dialogue cannot be transferred onto the screen but I think the film can be a great aid to anyone reading the novel for the first time.The best scene in my opinion is the Cyclopes episode where Bloom confronts the citizen - it is an excellent representation of Joyce's narrative and a valid interpretation of his elaborate imagery."
5,Great outdoor ashtray!,Not so easy to clean but its great for outdoors! The wind doesn't blow the butts out of the ashtray! Love it!
5,EXCELLENT to go into the Presence of the Lord,"Martha Munizzi delivers excitement and enjoyment to the joy of praise and worship. Her live performance tracks truly takes you higher in your timee of praise and worship. Surely, this album will touch the heart of man because it impacts you in a positive way. Look out for her...she's the real thing. She is a true psalmist in addition to having such a beautiful voice, yet with a powerful message behind that."
1,Title is sort of deceiving,"I just read this book as my wife and I are trying to save our marriage, I am not and have never been a control freak nor an abuser neither is my wife.There are a few, very few good points in the book such as going to bed at the same time.It describes insecure people as immature? How is that? I am an insecure man but I have always been mature beyond my years after marriage and children I always put their needs before my own no matter what!Our only problem is arguing which is fed by my insecurities and this also can kill a sex life!We have improved our relationship but it was prior to reading this book I bought it thinking it would turn me into the man of her dreams, I already do everything that was in this book?Very misleading!The title should be "" From an abusing, adulterous, control freak to the man of her dreams which will fun her into the woman of your dreams!""Very dissatisfied!"
2,Musty Translations,"Why did Oxford, in 1996, reprint prose translations from Kathleen Freeman's 1926 ""Life and Work of Solon,"" with their cries of ""Yea!"" and ""Ye glorious children of Memory""? Couldn't it get the rights to West's 1993 ""Greek Lyric Poetry"" at least (also published by Oxford)? More disconcertingly, we get an English Empedocles here of the vintages 1880 and 1898. Most of the major poets fare better, but Sophocles' ""Antigone"" is in H.R. Fairclough and A.T. Murray's 1902 Wardour Street (""didst thou"") version.With no reservations, I can declare this a very poorly conceived anthology. Anyone would do better to buy up a bunch of good translations in used paperbacks.If you absolutely had to have an anthology, I'm not sure what is best, but ""The Norton Book of Classical Literature,"" ed. B.M.W. Knox, is certainly far better."
1,Sour Old Man,"Now that the author is old and feels the shadows lengthening he has apparently decided to take refuge in venting his spleen against his younger stronger self. His last two books have sought to make a mockery of the young men who won WWII. He wrote a very good book ""Thank God For The Atom Bomb"" and an OK book on WWI and its effect on Western memory. This book is dull and in reality little more than a short story fit for Harpers or The Nation. Basically we won the war on the backs of 15 years olds and almost despite our disorganized selves. At least I think this is the author's point. The writing is muddy and I came away unsure of what he was really driving at except all the G.I.'s were poor stupid dupes. From what I have read here his most recent book continues the theme of the US soldier as inept coward. He can rail against cruel fate all he wants but he can't change his ultimate destination."
2,Lite Reading,This book covers ground better served up by others. I kept waiting for the entree but finished the salad in the last chapter. There are many books out there on this subject that present the material better. This is a quick read.
5,QEP 10020 Grout Removal Tool,"Very easy to use, better to use on wider than 1/8"" wide grout, works good.Tool lasts a long time. Fast prompt service."
5,This product works really well,"This is a really good product. I have three computers and I don't have any problems with it. The only thing that they did not mention in the manual is that, when clicking the ctrl, alt, shift buttons, make sure that you click it at a fast pace about a second apart. Because when I did it, it was at a slow pace and it wasn't working. But overall it is a great product to have when using more than one computer."
4,"Works well, but the documentation stinks!","First off, I'm a techie, and not afraid to experiment with *any* computer device. So, when I couldn't get this to work (yes, I read the directions!), I had to scour the web and discovered that the hot key sequence as described in the documentation (Ctrl-Alt-Shift) does NOT tell you that you need to hit AND RELEASE all keys in sequence. From the other reviews, I'm not the only user who had trouble discovering this anomaly, but now that I have it working, I suggest that you approach the key sequence as follows: tap and release the ctrl key, then the alt key, and finally the shift key, and you should see the Caps Lock and Scroll Lock lights alternate. Then, tap the number key for the computer you wish to access.So, while this works well, the documentation needs to be fixed."
1,Just Didn't Work,"Out of the box, on the 3 PCs, didn't work. Called 24x7 tech support, got through quickly and was told I had to start PC 1, when it was booted start PC 2, etc. Didn't work. Called tech support back, rebooted all 3 machines (you can only see one so you just power them off) he said it didn't matter what order the PCs were started in. Tried two other keyboards. My device worked on whichever PC started first, and only that one. It would not switch between them."
5,Love this sturdy princess castle,"I bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday and it has been a hit ever since - she plays with it daily. It is extremely sturdy, though the string on the drawbridge broke the first day, it just stays down and hasn't affected play or my view of the toy. I looked everywhere for accessories for this and ended up buying more of the Disney Princess sets (she already had quite a few) and it seems to be more than enough. Apparently, no furniture or anything is needed, just some princesses, princes, and her imagination! I would definitely recommend this."
5,Christmas for me,I bought this doll house for myself. As a kid I never had one. The grandkids and i have already enjoyed many hours of fantasy play... So cool... Note* It is bit difficult to get the horses into the far stall. LOL
5,Princess castle,Nothing to assemble. My 6 year old granddaughter loved it right away. Any child 3 and older can enjoy it. It's sturdyAnd complete with the doll set and furniture.
5,Very good quality,"Ordered this castle for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it! Her ""polly pocket"" Disney princesses work well with it - size wise. I am pleased with the quality of the castle - very well made and very pretty!"
3,Love but not well built,Ordered this for my 4 yr old and pulled it out of the box Christmas Eve to find it broke! Nothing I could do since in 8 hours was Christmas morning! :(
5,Folding Princess Castle,"I bought this castle for my 5-year old daughter. Her and her older brother enjoy playing with it, using Littlest Pet Shop animals, Lego figures, and Playmobil figures. The castle is very beautiful with many rooms, towers, and a small stable. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
4,"'Whoever she was, there was Eden'","This quote is Adam's final assessment of Eve; the true Eden is within us not a patch of picturesque landscape full of artificial harmony. I'm sure, had he died first in Mark Twain's vision, Eve would have said similar of Adam.This is a wonderful, imaginative and amusing piece of writing - short, but with wisdom. I will never forget Eve trying to get stars out of the night sky to place in her hair - first with a big stick ('they must be so far away,' she complains) and then with clods of earth! I will never forget the speculations - how did the milk get into the cow? And the 'scientific' tests to prove the various theories!Adam and Eve (and their children right up to Twain's own time) are fanciful imaginings in these writings but they are brim full of character and personality."
2,Slamming the Doll House,"It's a sad thing when a memoir causes you to dislike the author. She was traumatized as a child and never was treated, apparently. Instead, she insisted that others cater to her childishness and never learned to take responsibility for her actions. It's quite a statement that one can read her book and come out feeling sympathy for Philip Roth."
3,So so. 2.5 stars.,"I found this book to be a bit immature and somewhat outdated. Silly projects were featured while important points left out or glossed over. I don't have a bias against guns and gun ownership, but I was surprised at the amount of coverage guns received in this book."
3,Bought as a gift.,"Bought as a gift, but the receiver was very happy with it.Anything that gets someone to read about a subject they are interestedin is a plus."
2,Free info from MS site is better,"Usually I love the exam cram books, but this one is a serious let down. Granted AD Design is a very difficult topic to cover, but this book isn't nearly enough for you to be able to pass the test. I did pass with an 857, but I used many of the white papers from the Microsoft web site and a few other tools. without them I would have been sunk!!"
3,Good but flawed,"Some of the topics in this book are quite interesting. I think it's worth the read if you're into UFOs and stuff. However, he seems to discount all abduction stories derived from hypnosis. He basically says in the book that such accounts are not trustworthy without backing up his claim. Other books by Harvard psychiatrist John Mack, Dr. Diane Fiore, Hopkins, Dr. Jacobs, etc., would argue that hypnosis is indeed useful and quite accurate when used appropriately, and there's no reason to doubt it. Hypnosis revelations of abductions are similar if not identical at times to memories of abduction recalled without hypnosis. This is my only gripe with Strieber. The rest of the book is pretty good, like i said."
5,"Excellent, well documented work","It seems that the wait is over, and that some physical evidence is finally coming to the surface. The scientific community would do well to read this book or they'll fail to realize what's going on all around us."
1,The Alien Evangelist,"I read the earlyest two, and also 'The Secret School' and where the first two were interesting and even creepy. (Amuseing weather or not you happen to beleive in aliens...) 'The Secret School' read more like an TV Evangelist talking. It was quite sad, realy. Waste of a good author. If you're realy looking for a good book of his, read something like Cat Magic, if not, look else where. This is rediculous."
2,Didn't work.,"The ""beating heart"" never worked. Seriously. We never got it to beat. Not even once. I only gave it two stars because the stuffed animal is the perfect shape to stick in the corner of our dog's kennel. He loves snuggling up with it."
4,Calling All Llamas,Nordan's characters are wonderfully flawed and intelligently drawn. In LIGHTNING SONG he presents the reader with the perfect metaphor for the odd and beautiful. I have known such llamas my entire life and appreciate seeing this careful and fair presentation.
1,This has been praised to highly.,"You've got to be kidding! I taught literature for 35 years, and I'm an avid reader. This has to be the worst book I've read in a very long time.It is inane, pointless, impossible, and so completely out of touch with any sort of reality that I have to wonder why he would bother to put this together. I mean, really, what is the point? Stringing together a collection of disjointed absurdities does not make for quality."
4,their cool!,"Yes, I think they do help keep me a little cooler. I have had similar items before so I knew what I was getting. I even put a couple inside my straw hat.The only regret I have is that they don't stay cool as long a time as they state. Mine are finished by one hour. Yes, I would recommend them."
1,Terrible,"This album is terrible. It was a gift from a friend, and I have ended that friendship. As an African-American, I was offended that another white girl is making money off the Black sound. And, I was further infuriated that she had Black producers. All in all, mediocre production, and cheesy song writing. I'll stick with Kim Burrell"
5,God inhabits the praises of his people..Its time to enter in,"Being the owner of an online christian bookstore, I highly recommend this CD to anyone seeking intimacy with the Lord or a closer walk with thee. The praise and worship songs from this album will bless your life and walk with God. He inhabits the praises of the people, Martha is one the best qualified worship leaders in the world whom God has annointed to lead you into worship & praise right into the throne room. Remember God inhabits the praises of his people as the scripture says...Psalm 22:3 ~ MJ ~ owner of allgospeletc"
3,Where is Tom MacCubbin when you need him?,"I keep hoping Tom MacCubbin will release a new edition of Florida Home Grown 2: The Edible Landscape. I buy used copies for my gardening friends all the time. It's so much better than Stephens'. Vegetable Gardening in Florida is good, but Tom's is simply much better."
2,Don't bother,"This thing worked great..while it worked. My buddy went through 2, and I stopped at 1. they die after about 2 - 3 months. Spend atleast $150 on an audio-technica or swing for a seenhieser if you can."
4,Great Price!,Very satisfied for this product. Came sooner than expected and for a great a price? no one can beat that! Highly recommend it.
4,A nicely illustrated read,"I bought this book to use in a whale section I was doing in a literacy class. It wasn't gripping enough for that and the graphics were beautiful but not what I really needed. However, if I had a young person who was into whales or into Grandma tales it would have been perfect. A young person wanting to have a whale song connection with whales would probably enjoy this."
1,Amazing Grace,This didn't come close to what I ordered and did not come with return information. I ordered a CD. A Video Tape is not an acceptible substitution and was not EVEN by the same performer. BAD SERVICE! VERY BAD. This is the third of 8 items ordered resulting in extreme disappointment from Amazon.
3,Just pretty good,"The reason I give it three stars is that after his great prizewinning novel, we expect insight, not whimperingand a young girl in a tragic case being ""sold south"".For the novel's time it was a little daringand the historical content seem fine.My reasoning is that he just doesn't seem to understand the psychology of women very well. I don't think it is up to the potentialthat Robert Penn Warren had shown before. It seems an effort toget into the bestseller category insteadof being true literature."
5,great,th etester was what i expected and help me a lot to find the problem on my hummer h2 so thanks to the gauge i save a lot of $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$thanks and keep doing thing so people work easy
1,Strange sizing,"I'm 5 foot 8 inches tall, weigh 165 lbs. Ordered the Small size jacket, which turned out to be too long in the sleeves, yet not very roomy in the body. So I had to return the jacket. Warning: Check the return policy carefully. I only got 85% of my money back. Not a good experience for me."
3,Cool cloth.,"The Ice Bandana does work for a short time in 100 degree heat, however, when your exercise is over the 15 to 20 minutes you're out of luck and then the bandana is just a hot piece of cloth tied around your neck."
2,Neck Coolers for Summer Scout Camp,"I bought these for a week long scout summer camp. They work OK, but I found that using a gel cold pack and soaking it in ice water for 30 minutes and then wrapping it in a wash cloth, work better and the gel pack retained the cold better and was more refreshing."
4,Still Missing one Ice Pack,I'm still missing one ice pack and todate still have not heard from anyone. I would call this very poor customer service. This is the third or fourth time I'm just would like to have what I've payed for.Dale C. Clarkdalecclark1@yahoo.com
3,Not quite as described,"The description of this battery is a little deceptive in part, and outright wrong in part. The battery I received is a brand called ""Empire""(no doubt a Panasonic ""replacement battery"") and is only 900 mAh NOT the 1000 mAh advertised. I cannot speak to the durability or performance of the battery as of yet.If you want a genuine Panasonic 1000 mAh battery, this is not it!"
5,Excellent Replacement Battery,This battery is an excellent replacement for the battery that came with my phone. This battery is 1000 mAh as opposed to the original which is only 850 mAh. The price from an Amazon reseller was unbeatable.
5,White Diamonds,My wife loves this cologne and the price was better than I've been able to find it elsewhere. I received the order quickly and was very pleased!
4,"Good price, but is this the same stuff as retail???","I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present, as she loves this brand and has been using it for years. This is the first time that I didn't go retail for perfume, and am wondering if I did the right thing. The wife says that this doesn't smell the same as the last bottle that I bought for her in the mall (allegedly it is stronger smelling). I can't tell the difference since I am a guy, but if she isn't happy then the purchase may have been a waste of money. The bottle looks the same to me, and the price for the quantity received was terrific. I only gave this 4 stars because I perceived it to be a good purchase. Waiting to hear from some of the ladies who bought this online."
3,Whtte diamonds is not like the usual one,"i normally like white diamonds product, but this one is not like my usual buy, have decide not to buy online the perfumes"
5,White Diamonds perfume,This was a gift and the recipient loved the product and it arrived in time for Christmas. So the service was great too!
2,For Older Women...,"I got this as a graduation gift from my mom's friend whos in her 90's. She knew I liked Elizabeth Taylor's Gardenia perfume, so I imagine she thought I would like this one. While it does smell nice it's very strong and old lady smelling. It has a very old fashioned smell to it and its embarassing to wear if you are 18 years old..If you are younger than 40 don't buy this even 40's might find it a little too old school smelling..."
3,A decent book that lacks good photos,"I have both Ann Marie's books and the new book by Chris Shaffer and while both have done a good job describing the trails to the falls Shaffer's book offers many more waterfalls and color photographs that all you to really see what the waterfall looks like. The photos in Brown's book are very poor and dont do the waterfalls justice. But, she did do a good job letting us know where waterfalls can be found."
2,Please don't play it,"If you like AvP2, please don't bother to play this expansion pack, it doesn't have nothing new, even more the story have a lot of gasps and at the end you have a lot of questions about the story."
3,FAN TORN IN MANY PLACES,It doesnt have the shine I expected and it was torn in 5 different places. The material seems to be paper.
2,It's an alright controller,"I've purchased this controller well to tell you the truth, it's not what i had mind. I like flight simulators with a passion and i decided to buy this controller to play acecombat 4 and acecombat 5, but it doesn't work. It only works on airforce delta strike or unless there is another game that is compatible. Don't get me wrong it is a very good comtroller and it handles very good with airforce delta strike, but there's gotta be another controller joystick to play acecombat. If there's anyone out there knows a good controller for acecombat let me know."
2,Will make you happy -- until it breaks,"Although I ultimately hated it, I will say that this style of controller is quite a bit more usable than the standard PS2 dual shock for flying. You get stable set-and-forget throttle control, and one hand controls all 3 axes of motion. But it's plug and *almost* play -- it is severely out of calibration by default and requires recalibration every time you power cycle the game machine. After just a few hours of play the cheap internal trimpots got tired and I started getting unsmooth/erratic motion over the full range, making calibration a frustrating and finally impossible task. Also the stick has a huge amount of play that isn't helped a lot with center position calibration. For the price I didn't expect a lot but the unsmooth motion was a big disappointment. Bottom line, I will not be wasting my time on a flight stick from this price/quality level in the future!"
4,Good book for beginners,"This is a very good book for the beginners. Easy to understand to apply C# techniques using classes. It covers almost every important topic about the C# language that should be sufficient to get started to programming in C#. I wish if it had covered advance topics such as COM interops and Multithreading etc.For people who are beginning to learn C# this book should be the first book and then they can go for books such as ""Inside C#"" if they are looking for any advance topics."
1,Poor rating,Both batteries were worthless. Neither would hold a charge for any reasonable length of time for picture taking. I would not recommend purchasing these batteries from this company.
4,Solid Battery,"I bought this battery to replace the factory battery (came with the camera when I bought it) that had all but lost its ability to retain a charge. This battery is a pretty solid replacement, although I don't think it performs as well as a new factory battery.It fits the camera, the factory charger, and works well with the camera and I recommend this inexpensive replacement if your factory battery begins to wane.Thanks,Michael"
2,not the right fit,"These batteries look like they fit, but the edges are slightly rounded, so they won't stay in the camera unless you hold it there and close the flap carefully. They work but why did they round the edges so that they don't snap into place like my original Canon batteries did??"
1,worst chainring ever,"Seattle Bicycle Supply's support department doesn't seem to exist, so I can't confirm if I actually received an SBS chainring or not. There are no distinct markings on the chainring I received, and it looks nothing at all like the one pictured.Anyway, it's really, really crudely made. A Rocket Ring looks like a work of art compared to this hunk of junk. Spend the extra $5 for something a little better."
3,"Good, but....","I couldn't help feeling that this book lacked the amount of Lizzy and Darcy that I was hoping for, and focused too much on Georgiana. I also thought it had rather an abrupt ending. But, if your desperate, as I was, it'll do.....for now."
1,My cat could write a better sequal.,"I have always been a prolific reader and rarely do I come across a book for which I can find no value, no redeeming qualities. But I must extend a hearty congratulations to Julia Barrett for writing the most astounding piece of horse excrement I have ever had the misfourtune to purchace. Teachiing my cat to walk repeatedly over my keyboard would produce a work of more sense. If you are like me and just have to read it - just because you're obsessed with Austen - Buy it used for 45 cents and then burn it."
4,Entertaining and well-written in an admirable tribute to JA,"I've read the book twice and have been pleased both times. I certainly loved P&P more, but I did find this book a sequel that seemed to flow better from the original than some of the other sequels I've read. This is the one I come to when I wish there was more to P&P... I think detractors are expecting too much - JA was quite unique in her style and narrative (and humor). Unless the dead can pen stories, we are left with the efforts of others. And I liked this one quite a bit!!"
4,An entertaining read,"This is the first sequel to P&P that I've read. I was slightly skeptical, but based on the other reviews, I expected a decent story. And I wasn't disappointed. It's certainly not from the pen of Jane Austen, but the author does a fair job of capturing Jane's spirit and style. Some of the characters, particularly Lady Catherine de Bourgh, are exaggerated and come across as caricatures of their original counterparts, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The author has obviously done her research, right down to the stolen-lace incident involving Aunt Phillips that actually happened to Jane's own aunt--that was fun to discover. I'm on to more P&P sequels now--but Presumption has set a pretty high standard."
1,Pretty Bad,"I am quite a Jane Austen fan and have enjoyed a few of the attempts made by modern authors to finish her uncompleted novels; but I really don't have one good thing to say about this book. It's a mess. Don't waste your money or your time. If you want a really great completion of one of Austen's novels that captures her wit and style, try to find The Watsons, by John Coates (1958). It is hard to find, but worth the search."
4,Good measuring cup,"Well marked and seemingly durable. I do however, wish it were made of pyrex due to my general distrust of all plastic food prep items."
3,Common sense touchy-feely clap trap,"Realize you DESERVE love, and you will start attracting love.I just saved you $10.Also, diabetics should take an extra dose of insulin before reading this book."
2,I was certainly not the target audience...,"...or, perhaps, I was. But, in either case, I could take little from Attracting Genuine Love. Whether it was because my subconcious refused to believe that there was anything I needed from it or because I actually didn't need any of the steps within, I just couldn't finish the book.In all honesty, I couldn't get thirty pages (granted, that's a third of the way through) without shelving the book for a month only to see it again in my stack, feel guilt for not finishing, and read the same thirty pages over again before becoming bored to tears.This book was NOT for ME. And for that, I apologize that I cannot give it the due dilligence it deserves in a review, but there we are.My sincerest apologies to the authors, but there were no grand self-actualization breakthroughs in the pages I got through, so... from me... I can only give it two stars in good conscience."
5,Great book for learning how to attract genuine love,Gay and Kathlyn Hendricks are relationship experts! Get this book if you are interested in creating a genuine loving relationship. First know you need to do this with yourself...it's a step by step guide to creating and attracting that which you desire. So when you figure out what you want they will guide you to a step by step process with a CD to making the relationship of your dreams. It's all within your reach...honesty is their way of helping you help yourself.
2,Needs to be Streamlined,This could have been the best software of its type if only it weren't so clunky to use. Plan to spend A TON of time reading the manual just to get started using this product. the controls are definately not user friendly or intuitive. I've had it for a couple of weeks now and I still can't write what I want to write. Pass over this program and spend your money elsewhere untill the programers make this title easier to use.
3,aquabats? take me back to the days of old...,"well even though i love the aquabats profusely, this is very different and unfortunately not as good as the fury, or myths and legends- its not as catchy and needs a little more time in your cd player to get used to than their other cds... but still it is a good and has a aquabat-like list of songs... but not as nearly as ska and and funky and fun as their last few albums. what happened to the horn section??? in the mean time buy the cd and definitely go see them in concert, their shows are fairly cheap and will be worth it!"
4,Not their best album but anything by them is good,"I give this one 4.5 stars,I love all of the Aquabats stuff,and this one has some great songs,such as Demolition Rickshaw(my favorite off of this album),For Your Own Safety(6 seconds long),and Look at me I'm a Winner(you just can't argue with that!!!I can't wait for them to go on tour to Florida and hear them play the greatest music of all time(Devo close behind)!!!"
3,It's Not That I Don't Get It...,"It's just that I shouldn't have spent $10 on it. Admittedly, it is cute tongue-in-cheek (adult) humor. And it is very different than any other adult-geared humor book. However, I can't see myself reading this over and over (even thought it only took about 10 minutes to read it the first time), or even recommending it to anyone else. So, my $10 book goes on the shelf to collect dust. Maybe I'll pick it up again sometime when I need a quick boost. Do yourself a favor, borrow it from the library."
3,Not my favorite.,I didn't realize this is a book for adults. I bought it for my children's library and it doesn't fit.
2,I ordered the wrong DVD set!,"This does not contain the truly memorable sketches that I thought it would. If you are an ""original"" Carol Burnett fan and viewer of her variety shows, go for the 6 DVD set it has the most cherished and most-oft shown classic comedy shows you remember with reverance.If you just want to experience a much shorter collection to see if you want to view more, then this 2 set may be OK for you. Just take care to read the reviews very carefully!"
5,The Carol Burnett Show: Carol's Favorites (2DVD),Thanks for sending this DVD so quickly. I look forward to watch Carol and the whole gang. I tried finding this in the stores but no one had it. I am glad you had it.
4,One funny lady!,"I loved the Carol Burnett Show when it was on live TV, and it's great fun to be able to see some of the best moments from the show once again. She's a great comedienne and her side-kicks, Harvey Korman and Tim Conway, are terrific."
3,Carol Burnertt's show was some of the best humor ever put on TV.,Too much fluf talking and not nearly enough highlights. The CD's did not contain anything like the number of highlights which I hoped for. Seemed like a rip off.
3,The tales of Hoffman,"This book details the history of Mark Hoffman, one of the most controversial figures in modern day Mormonism. This was the first book that I had read on Hoffman. I read it as a young man (about 16 years of age), and it prompted me to do further study on certain questions regarding Mormonism that I found troubling. In a sense, I owe the authors of this book a debt of gratitude, as it was through them that I eventually learned of Fawn Brodie and the Tanners. I've been out of Mormonism for nearly 13 years now. I am deeply grateful to be out of Mormonism.I re-read this book again recently. It is a fascinating tale, certainly. However, it does seem to be too sensationalistic in points (not that the Hoffman story isn't sensational!). For a more balanced version of the Tales of Hoffman, I would reccommend Robert Lindsay's A Gathering of Saints."
2,Sensationalist tripe with a few interesting points,"As an interested student the Hoffman forgeries, I'd not recommend this book. The writers' agenda keeps showing and gets in the way of the tale. Of interest, though, is the cops' story which is told better in this book than many of the other accounts. As a person who lived through many of the events in the book and personally knew both police and LDS church security personnel, I know that this work has many inaccuracies...."
3,Waltons the Foundling (TV Premiere DVD),I was a little disappointed. It was not what I expected. I thought it was the Premiere for the series but it was not. I already have the whole set of the Waltons and have this one on one of the seasons that I own.
5,martial arts iaido uniform,"great quality for the money,perfect fit,if you are new to iaido or have been involved for awhile this is for you!"
5,"The perfect ""oversized wallet""","I have owned this bag for nearly 5 years. It is like an oversized wallet. I can fit my check book, cell and cash... along with receipts, etc. It fits nicely into my purse, backpack or diaper bag. When I don't want to tote the big bag out of the car, I just pull this out and off I go. Everyone who spots it comments on what a cool ""wallet"" it is, but it is much more! I have used it constantly for 5 years and have warn out the corner edges...no complaint intended, this bag has served me well! I am on the site today to order a new one."
5,Step2 Lifestyle Bed,"The Step2 Lifestyle Twin Bed was very quick and easy to assemble. My son, 2 1/2, loves his new bed and he even enjoyed helping me to assemble it. I love the fact that the sides are high and I do not have to worry about him falling out. I also like the storage compartments underneath. My sons uses the storage area as a barn for his stuffed animals. He has slept in his new bed for the past 3 nights and he is very proud of himself as well as his new bed."
1,"don't buy this, get Labtec WebCam Pro","I've just got both D-link usb 1.1 plus the Labtec WebCam Pro. Don't buy this product it's the waste of money, The picture of this is very blurry not so bright and the software is not that good at all. This is the worse product of D-link. Get Labtec WebCam Pro, the picture quality much better also the software is alots better especially the motion sensor recorder that I can use to surveillance my baby sitter. I hope this will help, thank you for viewing."
1,At least it looks nice!,"That necessary 1 star goes to the ""awesome"" looking design. Too bad this piece of garbage is easily beat out by the generic red and white air cans you can buy in bulk from your local electronics/supermarket/mall/warehouse/online store. If you really must, buy this and put it next to your computer, but make sure to keep the real cans of air close at hand for when you actually need to do some cleaning."
2,Very little Air,A cartridge lasts about 60 to 90 seconds. If you use very short bursts of air it might last a week or two.
1,big disappointment,works good if you use a whole cartridge every time. the blow tube links too easy and valve leaks over night
1,Truly Horrible,Simply preposterous. A complete waste of time. It made about as much sense as your average Scooby Doo cartoon. Not even the nice Blu-Ray presentation could redeem this cinematic turd.
1,Beware this disc from Disney,Two copies of National Treasure 2 would not play on Windows Media player 10 nor on my Cyberlink player on my computer that I watch nearly every movie on. The problem is copyright protection that Disney put on the disc which makes it incompatible with my system.
1,"NT 1 equals fun, NT2 equals dumb","Honestly one to the worst sequeals in memory National Treasure 2 is just plain dumb. From the missing mom of 32 years to the ""kidnapping"" of the POTUS this movie went from dumb to super dumb. You would think that these characters from the NT1 might have a little more clout after finding the greatest treasure of all time, but no, seems they can't keep their money, can't sell books and as far as finding bootay, well that would not happen for a rich and famous guy anyways...right? See how stupid my last comment was? That's how stupid the entire movie was. Not even worth a rental, this movie certainly goes on my top 100 worst movies I have ever seen. I wonder if Mannequin 2 is available at the video store...it might help me cleanse my pallette."
2,Book of Secrets,"This has to be one of the worst sequels I have had the mis-fortune to sit through at the cinema.A complete milk on the first film with a complete lack of any other original ideas, it should have gone directly to DVD and then we could pick it up in the bargain basement items."
4,Family entertainment.....,"I can't help but like the first movie better, it was so fresh and had a much more interesting villian. Second movies are hard to make when a movie was as succesful as 'National Treasure' but this one is pretty good. Family entertainment all the way and those movies are hard to find these days. Sorry to use the cliche but it works. It's very difficult to find a film that all family members will enjoy, it's pure fantasy but not the creepy kind and covers all the bases. If they want to do a third one and they did set the basis for that, I say, why not? Go for it. I'll take Nick Cage over a very dorky, old, Harrison Ford anyday!"
2,Not a sign of Goofy short here,"This title don't bring the short ""How to Hook Up Your Home Theater"", with Goofy. I confess I bought this blu-ray only to have that gem. Brazilian buyers may like to know that the disc presents Portuguese subtitles, not mentioned in the package."
4,Exciting adventure movie,"You don't have to watch the first National Treasure movie to appreciate this one. The same 3 actors play the main protagonists, so if you like Nic Cage that's great, because its more of the same. New adventures in Europe and the US are exciting and relatively easy to follow. Different storyline but same formula as the first equals a fun filled family movie full of new mysteries and treasures. I enjoy watching this over and over."
2,"""Da Vinci Code for Dummies""","Unnecessary sequel to the 2004 blockbuster sacrifices logic for globetrotting chases and obnoxious comic relief. A solid cast tries to keep the serial-style lunacy afloat, but ""National Treasure 2"" lacks the fun and intrigue of its predecessor. Mount Rushmore was better served in Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest."""
3,"Fairly silly, but still worth watching","Well, national treasure 2 wasn't awful. I'm as big a fan as anyone else of slightly cheesy but still entertaining movies (see National Treasure 1), but I felt this one somewhat underachieved. None of the actors really put any effort into the movie, the plot made little to no sense in certain areas, and there was no Boromir. That having been said, I still enjoyed seeing the movie, especially since I went into it with the idea that it would be a silly movie anyways. Don't take this one too seriously, and it'll be a good time."
4,Cool artifacts in interesting places,"4 of 5 stars for the adventure movie National Treasure: Book of Secrets. This is the second installment of the Benjamin Franklin Gates story. Same basic characters as NT1 but a whole new story. Same formula, follow clues to uncover treasure. Of course there are rival treasure hunter on the same quest. In this case, the rivals want to prevent Gates from being successful for purposes of hiding the truth about a historical event. This treasure hunt has lots of good action, some surprises and some way-out-yeah-right things (such as, kidnapping the President of the USA). A very well crafted story with some cool artifacts that all leads to a great ending. I do highly recommend this movie; fun to watch; kid friendly (its Disney) yet adult interesting. I do like Cage in this role and hope to see more NT movies. Voight is OK in his role but not as strong as Cage.This is a great Saturday afternoon pass-the-popcorn movie."
4,great cartoon and a good movie..,"The Goofy cartoon ""How to set up a home theater"" was worth the price of admission. I only hope it is included with the DVD (which should arrive today).. If you have heard that it is included, let the rest of us know.What I really like about this movie is that it teaches some history along with a fictional story and isn't rated beyond most student's viewing.. I realize how badly it has been reviewed but you can't dismiss the production values, excellent actors and a variety of interesting scenes.."
2,Not as good as first one,"Not as good as first one, plot too complicated, didn't make sense. Just bought it because part of it filmed in Black Hills, where my husband grew up."
3,badbones,Hey not as good as the first National Treasure but hey it's PG and family friendly. Had it's moments but not enough of them to bring it up to the first movies standards. Writing could have been much better. I didn't thing Cage was giving it his all this time aroung.
4,Pretty good.,I loved the first national treasure so when this was in the movies we went and saw it and were a little disappointed. It's an awesome movie; PLENTY of action maybe a little too much for some people. It's an interesting plot you never know where the hunt will take them next or whatt'll happen. The problems though are in this movie they focuses more on action than the actual puzzle-solving-which (if you like that kinda thing.) makes it a nice spy movie. Also the villan is VERY weak not at all like the first movie's bad guy. But if you're looking for a nice treasure hunt this movie is for you.
3,works great with mouse/keyboard/video but subpar with audio,"I connect this kvm with a mac and a pc, I was able to hook even a microsoft wireless mouse to kvm , it works like a charm. However the audio portion did not work very well. First , there is a lot of static compare to connect directly to the machine. Second, when I switched to mac, I still can hear the pc audio in the background."
2,Iogear 2 Port MiniView Micro USB Audio KVM Switch ( GCS712U ),"Just got this KVM for a specific reason - to switch audio between two PC's, along with the std KVM funcions. Already had a KVM that switched video, keyboard, mouse.It turned out to be a waste of money in my case. The audio switch limits the frequncy so bad, that it sounds like a cheap AM radio. There was no audio related spec on this product, but only a silly fool would design a device with such a proor performance. Don't buy it, if you want to switch audio with it.I will be returning mine."
3,Chain Hoist Surprise,The chain hoist I ordered seems to work well and was sent promptly. Howeverit was advertised as having a 10 foot lift and it actually measures 7 feet from hook to hook. Otherwise it's fine.
2,Try Linksys,"Comment: I have two dlink dwl-ab520's and a DI-764.The cards worked fine with win 2k, NT 4.0, Win 98, and Win ME. However when I placed these cards in two different Dell Poweredge 400SC with Win XP pro, they would freeze up the OS, unless I disabled the driver. Dlink tech support was totally worthless on the phone and email. I tried disabling the NT wireless service, installing three different dlink drivers, and installing the OS 2 different times.*Admitedly I could get the driver to work, but it would lock up the computer in five minutes.I bought the Linksys WMP55AG. It worked first try. No problems at all.Since I have 5 years experience as a Network Admin, I think I can handle installing a nic...."
2,"So so, ho ho","Yes it's true Virginia, the Christmas classics were run through a digital strainer, I just wish what came out the other side was more interesting. There is a reason you can buy a copy for .34 cents."
4,"Good, but not great!","Bruce R McConkie's doctrinal sermons and books forever changed Mormonism by taking things to a new level. I have been a long time ""fan"" of BRM and his accomplishments. As much as I liked this book, I found it redundant at times, more autobiographical at times, and slightly scattered and chopy. However, I do appreciate the book and the insight it does offer into the life of BRM. Glad it was written!Besides the fact that the book does not flow well, repeats itself oft, and is certinaly a biased approach (as a son ought to be, of course) the last two chapters are worth the reading. I must say that I was as touched by reading the last two chapters as I have ever been in any other book I have read. The journey may be jumpy and slightly rough, but the end is quite beautiful and touching."
3,Poor conversion from print.,"The book was what I expected from the Mountain Man series, but the conversion from print was not done very well."
1,Bad for Puppies,"I bought these thinking that they would be good for my puppy to chew on in her kong. When I picked up and looked at the label, I should have know not to give this to her. These Ziggies contain wheat gluten in them. My puppy had the diarrhea from these for a few days. I ended up taking her to the vet. Don't buy these, buy the kong treats for puppies, they are healthy for puppies."
1,"Don't make my mistake, buy Linksys instead!","Buy a Linksys router instead! The D-Link product concept is good. A wireless router with a print server built in. I can hard wire my PC for broadband at my desk, as well as use my laptop anywhere in or outside the house . With this set up, I can surf the net with both computers at the same time with one internet connection. The plus is that I can also use the printer with both computers. The problem is that I have been unable to connect to the internet with this router! Tech support is clueless as to the problem. I have spent several days on the phone trying different scenerios without luck.The concept is great, but the equiptment is useless.Buy LINKSY, great equiptment, ran flawlessly and great tech support."
4,Contacting Your Spirit Guide,"If you do not already know how to meditate, Sylvia Browne will make it easy for you with this delightful CD. She provides clear information about spirit guides and helps you meet yours. What fun!"
5,Complete satisfaction gauranteed,I really appreciated this product. It was enlightening to say the least. I highly reccommend for your spiritual well-being
4,To the point,"Easy to understand. CD included and also a picture of her spirit guides. You realise that after all, psychics, mediums, are normal persons. They have normal life experiences."
3,Interesting stuff,"My wife's a huge Sylvia Brown fan. She reads her books, watches her on Montel, goes to her live appearances etc. I, however, take all things metaphysical with a grain of salt. But this book is interesting, actually got me thinking maybe there's more to this stuff than I realize.If you're looking for entertainment, though, try ""No One's Even Bleeding"" and ""Delano""."
2,Worked great (for 6 months),"[...]Anway, I continued to use the mp3 player and actually found it very useful for the last six months. Last week, the FM transmitter failed and now there is a noticable hum in the mp3 playback. From the beginning it was apparent that the build quality was very questionable. As others have said, I should have paid an extra $50 and gotten an MP3 player from a reputable company (Apple, Creative, etc.)"
1,Was defective right out of the box,"I recieved the MP3 player for Christmas, and it worked fine, untill I tried to hook it up to my computer and discovered that the USB port on the player was defective. 97% of the time, the player wasn't even recognized by my computer, rendering it useless. Test the player on your computer before anything else and make sure that it works!"
2,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with this item and now must submit to the lengthy return process. The software included did not work, the customer support line was a phone call to HONG KONG and the directions were difficult to follow. Keep shopping, this is not the MP3 player for you."
4,A lot of harmless fun,"Okay, so it won't win any prizes at Sundance or Cannes, but this is a fun little flick of the kind the French excel at. The characters are likeable, the dialogue funny without vulgarity, and the plot totally unbelievable (which is part of the fun!).Chances are, the same film, in the hands of the American film industry, would have been either lewd or absurdly slapstick. Instead, it manages to retain a certain sweet innocence.I enjoyed it -- which is all I ask from a film like this!"
5,Affordable and good quality,"For such a bargain, this ginger supplement works wonders. Within a couple days, there is a noticeable improvement in my digestion, which in turn, improves my allergies (mostly sinus)."
2,Album of Music Clips,"The music is haunting and beautiful, but unfortunately each selection is simply a short one minute (or less) clip of what you would hope to be a far longer piece of music. Just as you are settling into a Southwestern mood, the selection just stops. This CD could be so much more if each selection played for a few minutes to set a mood, instead it just stops suddenly and goes on to the next selection. I recommend buying it, but you too will be disappointed in the brevity of each beautiful piece of music."
2,Not a good product for rolling,"Bought for travel from the East coast to Hawaii. It was not stable enough to roll, once you try to roll it your pet is at an angle position and it falls over while moving.We left it at the hotel it was so bad."
5,Why Homeschool?,"This book is perfect for anyone contemplating homeschooling but who feels a little uneasy or unsure about their prospect. For me, reading this book was a great relief and encouragement. I had thought for sometime that I wanted to homeschool, but I had many questions for which I just couldn't seem to find the answer. This book answered those tough questions. Questions like am I bright enough to teach my child? What about ""socialization""? What about college? Will my child grow up to find that no company will give a homeschooled child a chance? The answers to these and many other questions are explained thoroughly and in an easy to understand way. I have recommended this book to many friends and have given it as gifts to many family members."
1,Nothing but trouble,"This D-Link DUB-C2 cardbus adapter for USB2 but caused so many problems I gave up on it. Hours with D-Link support but card never produced USB2 speeds.I bought an ADS Tech Dual-Link cardbus adapter DLX-181 that arrived today. Nice card: two USB2 ports (one powered via adapter, one unpowered), one firewire 6-pin and one firewire 4-pin ports.Most support and forum gurus say not to install the proprietary drivers but to let W2K with SP4 find and install its own drivers. I did this but to no avail. I suspect all my enhanced USB2 drivers were mucked-up up due to the stupid D-link/OWC drivers.So I installed the drivers that came on the CD (ALi drivers) and card delivers USB2 speeds. 9g of data transfered to my external HD in 20 minutes (vs. 2.5 hours previously). ADS Tech card and drivers are just dandy. USB2 speeds and Firewire when needed."
5,Good solid base in Latin,"Latin: First Year by Henle will give you a solid base in the language. Even though it is titled First Year, the material may take over two years to cover. To use this book you must also have Henle's Latin Grammar book. The Latin Grammar is referred to throughout this book, right from the start."
2,who needs only 1?,"who needs only 1? too expensive to order for other sidetoo many words requiredif you really want reviews, you will require fewer words"
2,What we don't see counts.,"It may have clean verbage and a winning premise, but the story misses at every turn. The book attempts to cover Puerto Rican weather, politics, the social climate, and the main focus: a Russian ballerina and her dance troupe. But the novel fails to cover anything well. The book never fleshes out the characters. Every scene which might engage the reader and become exciting happens off stage so that we're left with a narrator's lackluster reference to it. We don't even really see the ballerinas warm-up, let alone feel their joy in dancing. I'm not sure what the writer's goal was since there's very little tension, and the story fails to have a clear plot."
1,This Album Was A Big Disappointment!,"I like George Benson. I think he's a great jazz guitarist. However, this album fails to do anything but remind me of what a waste of tape this album was. It's way too commercial. It doesn't break any barriers or really has nothing to say musically that's interesting. He might have been a great jazz guitarist during this time, but his songwriting is awful. Nothing deep about this music. I also have to say that his improvisations on this album are totally cliche of jazz at that time. What a disappointing album. He should have titled this album ""The George Benson Fake Book,"" because it's like Columbia hired a ""fake"" George Benson to come in and play guitar. George Benson has done some great albums, unfortunately, this isn't one of them."
3,Not as bad as others are saying,"Many of the reviews for this book just plain blasted it. Since it was so cheap, I ordered it to see what the fuss was about. Know what? It's about the same level as many college textbooks I've read - not great, not horrible, but definitely useful."
1,Poor for exam review Good for PHDs,"I've read all of the MCSE 2000 exam cram books and this one is by far the longest. (Too long in fact)These books are suposed to be preps for the exams... with the historical overhead and the Author's inablility to make anthing simple or consise, I really think this book should have been used by Coriolis as their Exam Prep book not their Exam CRAM book."
3,groan,"okay first thing why is nancy always the one the boys go after, is the most attractive, and the best at whatever they are doing in the book? Apparently she is amazing at acting, tap dancing, ballet, playing the piano, tennis, singing, art, public speaking, golf, and most importantly, detective work. Of course in this book a man loves Nancy and she is great at golf and other people keep injuring her hand and she is in 'intense pain' (of course it is never Nancys fault because she is perfect). i cant belive ned nickerson goes out with her because she always dates other guys when he is not around. i am 10 years old and love the nancy drews but i really wish nancy was not so perfect it makes it seem almost fantasy."
2,title just about sums it up,"I like Garbage. I have their other two albums. I had this one, too, for about an hour. I bought it, listened to it, and sold it back to a used cd store. It has some catchy hooks, don't get me wrong, but it is just too bubblegum pop-ish for my tastes. If your looking for the driving beats and raw emotions present in past Garbage albums, do NOT buy this album."
3,It's Not Garbage Anymore,This CD is completely different from any other Garbage CD. It's quite a dissapointment to say the least.
2,What happened?!,"Now, let me say I'm a big Garbage fan. Their first two albums rocked and were full of high energy and a total in-yer-face sound that few can match. So, I've been looking forward to this since last year when I heard they were back in the studio. And now I have it, it grieves me to say it's a bad outing. It's just a pop album that's all too fluffy and underwhelming. All the loud guitars and mechanical wizardry have been dropped...."
2,"Just like the Cardigans, Garbage eventually disappointed me","Maybe I have to give this a few more weeks of listening, but right now I would say it's substandard crap. Garbage was great, Version 2.0 was brilliant, but there's nothing ""beautiful"" about this junker.Hurry up and get back to work on the oft-rumoured compilation of b-sides and remixes, people."
3,3rd time - not quite as charming,"I wondered if I had bought the right album when listening to the first few tracks. It was like they had lost their ""edge"" and I was listening to Garbage-lite. The remainder of the album was better, but still not a match for their first two."
5,Great Surprises From Garbage yet again!,"On Garbage's newest release you might be surprised to find such a wide variety on the musical spectrum. The opener ""Shut Your Mouth"" is the most reminiscent of older Garbage songs with Shirley's tell-it-like-it is lyrics, where as ""Androgyny"" is the most pop song the band has put out yet.""Cup of Coffee"" & ""Drive You Home"" are filled with melancholy and sadness, but yet still comes across as beautiful, in my opinion, the best on the cd. The most odd paring of songs would have to be Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!) which is filled with electronica where the following song, ""Breaking Up The Girl"" is done acoustically. Even with such a appearingly strange pairing, it somehow works for them.So if you're an old fan or found this on accident, I highly recommend you buy the masterpiece that is beautifulgarbage. There really is something for every musical taste on it somewhere."
2,WHAT HAPPENED!?!,"I consider ""Version 2.0"" to be a near masterpiece of composition & musical layering of the highest order. There's not a song there that isn't more than what it first seems. As with many great bands, Garbage albums take a few listens to sink in & perhaps ""beautiful"" will become that for me too. However, I highly doubt it because the themes & melodies here, with a few exceptions, are so unoriginal & sophomoric that they are truly unworthy of such a talented band. I'm all for bands trying to expand themselves, but to wait four years for something that is not so much a giant step backwards as it is a giant step in the wrong direction. What happened indeed? I'd like to get these guys in a dark room & torture them until they spilt the beans. I can't imagine the answer they would give but I'm open-minded. I purchased this on faith, something I rarely do anymore. I won't do it again."
2,Garbage sounds like No Doubt...Why Oh Why,"Garbage was the top synthesizer rock band of the 90s. They managed to be innovative and accessible, brutal and mellow, playful and dark all at the same time. They sounded more futuristic than Radiohead. Their memorable songs eclipsed Bjork. 6 stars for band's debut. 5 for Version 2.0.All had been well and good...until they started hanging out with No Doubt, who shamefully corrupted the Garbage sound. The result is this horrible atrocity called ""BeautifulGarbarge."" The band sounds like they are doing ND cover songs...trite, empty, confused, crippled and out of focus. Skip this pile of garbage and wait for the band's upcoming ""Bleed Like Me""...unless, of course, you are a ND fan."
5,A new Garbage style,"The first time I listened to this album, I was disappointed. It didn't sound like the garbage I knew at all. It was a different band.And that's all this album is about: garbage re-invented. Don't buy it hoping to get a ""Version 3.0,"" you won't; in this new album, the band uses different styles, different lyrics, going to a new level never before seen, but with the same good music and with the same great Shirley Manson as always!!Thus, make sure you give this one a try; you won't regret at all."
4,New style but more honest lyrics.,"Garbage's new cd, Beautifulgarbage, has a very new style to it, especially at first listen. I was very skeptical and very dissapointed when I first heard it, but after listening to it a few times I have really begun to like it. Shirley Manson's lyrics are more open and honest then on the first two cds. Songs range from upbeat and catchy, Cherry Lips, to more personal songs, Cup of Coffee. Other songs, Shut Your Mouth, resemble the older style of Garbage. Very different from the first two albums, Beautifulgarbage has its own feel and flavor while at the same time remaining a cd only Garbage could put out."
4,Another level for garbage,"I love garbage's first two albums and this one is almost as good as those two. They seem to borrow some new wave sounds for a couple songs, while at the same time trying to keep their ""alternative sound"" that drew me to them in the first place. This album is not like the last: there are not as many techno tracks (only a couple) The only song I really dont like is Cry these tears: it seems to have to much of a poppy sound with the choir in the background. Other than that song, this is a great album."
4,It's pretty good...,"Beautiful Garbage is a cool CD, it really has some great songs to do whatever to....and there are a couple songs that got me wondering what they were on when they produced them. Honestly though, I like V 2.0 a hell of a lot better."
3,Not as good as the other ones,"These songs aren't bad but they aren't...GARBAGE SONGS! (My mom laughed when I told her I wanted a CD of Beautifulgarbage anyway.) I love Version 2.0, and these songs don't have the bite that we associate with Shirley Manson. They're pretty wimpy and forgettable, but for the two that you have heard on radio and TV. I take out the CD and play every now and then, but I'm not nearly as obsessed as I was with the other 2 CD's Garbage has graced us with. Let's hope they upgrade their level of Garbageness next time."
4,Not the usual Garbage,"I was very surprised when I first listen to this album. I was more used to the songs on the debut and version 2.0. While it is good in it's own right, it is a very pop music sound. There are some songs taht are great. On some songs it does not even sound like Shirley Manson singing."
5,so so beautiful,"Garbage's supreme MASTERPIECE has arrived! This is garbage at their core. All of the songs are wonderful. Its a much more mature work than their debut or V2.0 . Shirley Manson's voice springs pure poetry this time around. I have awaited this album for years, and its better than i expected. (Actually, I dont really know what i expected, but whatever it was this is way better.) This has to be my fave cd of all time along with Linkin Park in 2nd place. I have had their albums since Only Happy When It Rains was released. When V2.0 came out, i bought it immediately. Now..I've listened to Garbage's slow maturing, and it was worth the wait. They are one of the best bands of all time."
4,*Beautiful* Garbage,"A lot of fans and general music people have criticized Garbage for their poppier sound on their new disc, I for one, am not one of those critics. I think the sound on Beautiful Garbage flows well following Version 2.0, more so than their eponymous debut did into 2.0. they also said they wanted to do something fun, something that they could enjoy & have a go with (laugh at, to use my british slang). Their live shows still rock, the ballads are still haunting & ethereal, and they still make me want to get up & dance/fist pump. gotta love Shirley Manson's new Annie-Lennox-circa-""Sweet-Dreams""-Eurythmics look. Fave tracks: ""Can't Cry These Tears,"" ""Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go),"" ""Breaking Up The Girl."""
3,A sonically diverse album,"By far, beautifulgarbage is the most diverse album sonically that Garbage has released. The album incorporates influences from 1950's doo wop to music from the late 1970's and into the 1980's, laid back ballads, as well as what could be called ""typical Garbage."" Even with these diverse sounds, they are arranged and mixed in such a way that they flow well and fit together on the CD.Overall, it's a decent album. However, I would have left ""Nobody Loves You"" off the disc, because it breaks up the flow of the album right near the end. My personal favorites on the CD include: ""Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!),"" ""Shut Your Mouth,"" ""Breaking Up the Girl,"" ""Androgyny,"" and ""Can't Cry These Tears.""This is an enhanced CD, with the ""beautifulgarbage mixer."" Personally, I thought this was a waste. The interface is rather cumbersome, and I just didn't enjoy my experience with it. Personally, I think this enhanced portion of the disc could have been left off without hurting anything."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD in hopes of hearing some cool female vocal alternative rock... something the music world needs more of. This CD contains pop-like, even some 50's style music. Maybe I'll learn to like their new style, but it's just not the Garbage I know and love. Disappointing...."
2,it's ok,"a couple really good tracks. pretty ordinary though - it all kinda sounds the same, for better or worse. the ""enhancements"" to the cd are absolutely worthless."
1,One star for Garbage,"This isn't a one-star album in the Britney Spears sense, but Garbage has packaged the 13 least interesting songs they've ever put together into one convenient package. While it would be quite expensive and time consuming to try and collect every artist they ripped off on this album, no one in their right mind would try. For a singer clearly dealing with as much anger and frustration as Shirley clearly is going through (read the studio diaries), this album is annoyingly tepid."
3,AAaAaCCKkk!!,"Garbage's first Debut album was indubitably their best work... then we hit 2.0 which was good but started to stray from their original Sound... HOping that Beautiful Garbage had the good stuff like ""Milk, Stroke of Luck, Vow, #1 Crush, Supervixen, Queer, Temptation Waits, Medication, The Trick is to keep breathing, and finally You look so Fine."" I found I only liked A cup of Coffee, and Cherry Lips which I found to be a damn funny song.Otherwise I miss the angry masochistic Shirley."
4,Stop whining.,"How many times can you hear I Think I'm Paranoid? The debut album and Version 2.0 are on CD if you want to hear them. For now at least, Garbage have taken a decided turn away from that layered sound to reveal what is at their core ... a little genre-bending here and there.And thank god its not a Blink CD with every song having the same production over and over and over."
4,Good,"I like this album but i prefer version 2.0, but then i have only had this album for two days. There is a change of direction on this album but it is executed perfectly and the album is somewhat faultless. My favourite tracks are, Androgyny (1st single release), Parade, Cup Of Coffee, Cant Cry, Drive You Home and Shut Your Mouth. This is a must have buy for any Garbage fan"
4,any garbage fan will like this album,"garbage has pulled off another sweet collection of tunes...this is less the intense pop/party album than version 2.0 but is more diverse in range of style than their self-titled album...this is just my opinion but i think that any fan of garbage's who has been there through all their transitions and whatnot will really enjoy this album...please pick this up even if you have any doubts...you can always sell it back later...Garbage, please keep puttin it out (hee-hee)..."
4,Don't expect rock and roll.... but do expect to rock,"This third release by Garbage is definitely interesting. Like the title of my review says, don't expect the hard rock and roll sound like the first CD. You will be disappointed. This one is closer to techno, using many more electronic beats than I expected from them. The result? An album that still rocks, but you can dance to. The only thing that sounds similar through any of the tunes is Shirley's voice. I love the fact that you can pick up this CD, and listen to it the whole way through without wondering if you are still listening to the same song.""Til The Day I Die"" has a riff that reminds me of Jimi Hendrix's ""Are you Experienced"", while the rest of the album floats through different styles, even incorporating a harp (?) in ""Cup Of Coffee"" that sounds so eerie it gave me chills up my spine. The range of tunes is great, and makes this release a worthwhile addition to your collection.Buy it!"
2,What the...,"To me, Garbage always seemed like a band that had the potential of going from cutting edge to uninteresting pop. Guess what? Beautiful Garbage leans right into the sound that makes Britney Spears and Pink so cheesy. Some people take fame and use it to develop new ideas other people get caught up in the glitter and become part of the system that generates tons of bland music. I hope Garbage turns away from this sound. If your'e going to use the current trends in your music, at least be creative about it."
1,Not Beautiful at All,"I loved the first CD, I liked the second (Version 2.0) But I hate Beautiful Garbage. Almost every song is pure techno/dance with the exception of ""Breaking Up the Girl"", the only song that remotely resembles the first cd. If the band continues with this sound they will truely live up to their name"
2,Next evolution.,"Beautiful Garbage should be on eveyone's shopping list for Christmas. It offers everything the faithful Garbage fans want, plus music that will attract new listeners. They continue to re-invent the notion that the next release should be the same as the last."
4,Don't take out the garbage,Yay shirley!! I give this album two healthy thumbs up! The entire album explores new depths and regions of unexplored territory for the band. You can really see how far they've come and how much they've grown... yay garbage
3,Not the usual Garbage fare...,"I know a lot of people enjoy the music on this album, but if you're really into the heavier, nastier side of Garbage, this album might not be for you. I strongly suggest listening to examples of a few of the songs first (namely, Cup of Coffee, which, I'm very very sorry Shirl, but it killed me. Okay? It killed me.) But listen to more than one. I do LOVE the first track on this album and will probably wear it out in no time. This would be a very good CD for non Garbage fans, actually. If you like Garbage-y music, you'll like a few of the tracks, and if you don't, you'll like a few of the other tracks."
5,"Great movie, great actors","Concerning the story: the frail girl Gelsomina is sold to the bully Zampano, who treats her dismally. They tour the country with a circus, until the sad climax of the story.What makes this movie so special are the two main characters, who deliver a tremendous performance. In addition, the movie is made in black and white, with harsh and sharp contours; a feeling of loneliness permeates the visuals, the actions and the dialogues. One scene jumps out that underscores the sadness of the story. As Zampano buys an icecream at a little stall towards the end of the movie, he doesn't lick at the cone. Instead he pushes it into his mouth and swallows it completely, without stopping to taste it. It is visuals like this that turn this movie into such a strong account of suffering people, lost in a harsh, lonely world."
1,Watch the tcm broadcast of La Strada,"I watched this movie on TCM (Turner Classic Movie) and felt that the movie was very pointless. Watch this movie when it comes to cable or for the low rental price of $3.99 or less (try renting for less than this, that's all it's worth). I agree with some of the other low rating reviewers the movie was badly scripted and subtitles were bad. The actress is a five footer. Definitely don't buy this movie. It leaves too much of a bad taste in my mouth just thinking about it."
3,Much ado about too little,"Giulietta Masina pulls you through the film with her open, honest presence, winning smile and sparkling eyes. The film itself, while beautifully filmed, seems much ado about too little. I don't believe the film has the depth people attribute to it. It's a simple story with little happening much below the surface."
5,"Yeah you rite, brah!","My trip to New Orleans this week was without a doubt my best road trip ever. This guide made it possible. Having only been to New Orleans three times, I was concerned about being able to fill four days with events other than sleeping off the previous night's madness. This book enabled me to drag myself and my friends around town like a native. I cannot recommend this book enough (or the Chicken Roulade Tchoupitoulas at K-Pauls, also 5 stars)!!"
4,Lonely Planet - New Orleans,"Overall the Lonely Planet - New Orleans is a useful guidebook with plenty of information. This particular edition needs a couple of items updated (due to going repairs since Katrina), however even these changes are mentioned as likely to occur in the guide. I found the guidebook format different to other Lonely Planet Guides that I have used previously with information arranged along thematic lines rather than geographical lines. For example rather than having all the info on one suburb/area in a chapter the book has all the info on Eating Out or Sleeping. I found this made for some extra page-turning, especially until I got used to it. In summary a worthwhile guide to what I found to be an enjoyable destination."
5,Sincere and Illuminating,"The author talks about his career as an FBI agent and his successful entry into the HRT (Hostage Rescue Team). The author is sincere and gives great detail on FBI missions. He also discusses how the FBI's HRT handles missions not quite military, but too intense for law enforcement. Very good book and well written."
5,Exceptional and literary extreme erotica,An erotic novel written with exceptional skill and use of the language. Characters are developed and provide the reader with exquisite insights into both personality and sexuality. The actions described are believable yet extreme. Tess and her roommate Martine are delectable counterpoints to the truly perverse painter. Excellent interplay between personality and truly raw sexual excitement. Outstanding narratives of flaggelation scenes.
3,Magicians battle each other and then a demon Pig,"My wife got this for me because she knows I love horror novels. Lord knows I would have skipped it myself. The book is a pleasent enough time waster, but there is a lot of better material out there to pass the time of day with. Worth skipping."
3,Replacement Blade Panasonic Electric Razor,Not like the original; major vibration and pinching. I ended up throwing out the whole electric razor and buying a new one.
3,Not as bad as I thought.,"This is a fun movie to watch with friends or if you have nothing to do. It wasn't as bad as everyone is making it out to be, But it's not Wes Craven's best. Picture was great so was the sound."
2,What happend?,What happend to Wes Craven?His movies used to be so good.I guess he doesn't have the touch anymore.This movie was bad in so many ways.I think it's time for ol' Wes to retire.Do Not waste your time or money on this cr@p!you'll be sorry if you do!
2,"Great idea, but not a great film","I was really looking forward to this as Wes Craven was writing and directing like he did back on Nightmare On Elm Street. However in the end it just did not deliver. It was shot really well and the concept was great, but it did not equal the sum of it's parts. It got confusing and lost its focus half way through. it wasn't terrible, but I was just hoping for more."
2,What was Wes Craven thinking?,"This movie made me sad. I've loved Wes Craven films for years and was really looking forward to seeing this. Wow, was this was a bad movie.Things start making no sense almost immediately. The dialog is completely inane. None of the characters are likeable, or sympathetic. The story makes very little sense. It's not scary at all. The special effects are laughable. The only character development comes at the end of the movie. The ending is a giant jumbled mess.I don't need my horror films to be full of gore to enjoy them, actually quite the opposite. But a decent, plausible storyline is a must.This was a terrible disappointment"
2,"7 friends share a birthday with the day a serial killer died...are they possesed? Neat idea, bad movie. I say C-","Every year on ""Ripper Day"" (the day where a serial killer known as the Ripper died) seven friends who share a birthday get together to ""ward off his spirit"". This year something different happens. During the annual ""Ripper day"" festivities Bug (Thieriot) is chosen to ""fight off the ripper"", after he fails his friends say its all a joke anyway and not to worry. But then things go wrong. This movie had a very neat idea : the ripper had seven multiple personalities and seven kids were born the day he died, supposedely with each of his personalities. After the initial build up, the movie never really gets going. I found it to be very boring and not scary at all. I think it was trying to be a ""Friday the 13th"" type movie but never got there. This is a movie where after you watch it you feel nothing. I give it a C-.Would I watch again? - Nope"
3,"Pretty, but too basic...","I was looking for a dictionary for my first grade classroom - something appealing and complete, but focused on children age 6-7. I love most DK books, and while this one is visually appealing, it was missing a lot of basic words. For example, ""turtle"" is no where to be found. Perhaps by adding the thesaurus they cut out some of the other basics. I ended up selecting another DK dictionary, the DK Children's Illustrated Dictionary instead. The American Heritage First Dictionary is also excellent - Houghton Mifflin ISBN0618280073."
2,Dissapointing,"Ill admit first off, I love Patty Loveless she is a great singer. This album was her first real studio album since 1997's Long Stretch of Lonesome. So it was almost 3 years since her last. Thats a long wait, and after such a great album, one of her best yet, theres Strong Heart. Theres the fun Thats The Kind of Mood Im In which is the standout, but otherwise the collection seems to drift into nowhere and the songs dont seem to flow well together. I found it personally a little disapointing after such a long wait, and after such a great album as Long Stretch of Lonesome."
3,Moon tiger or mooning tiger?,Didn't enjoy the first person writing style on occasions. Thought it meandered like the main character's fevered mind but at times this writing device was confusing and annoying. Enjoyed the passages about war time in Egypt. Her final moments at the end were very authentic.
1,The AI cars are brain dead,"If there was a Hall of Fame for all time bad racers Crash N'Burn would make the top 10 with ease.The AI cars are brain dead, the collision detection very suspect and the audio is abysmal. The cars don't exactly convince the eye that they are lumps of metal smashing into each other, all they do is convince the eye that they are lo quality computer graphics."
3,Maxell VHS tapes,"I was happy to get to order these tapes, because almost no one carries them any more. What I was not happy with was the fact that the packs were open when I got the package, and one of the tapes was broken. Other than that all is good."
5,Almost perfect,"This is an extremely helpful tool to understand many aspects of the novel that may be overlooked. I would've liked to see the final edition text added to this edition. But this is a great resource, especially for students/teachers. The worst part of the whole book is the commentary thrown in at the end by hack Science Fiction writer and Killer of Dune Kevin J. Anderson. I was in a good mood until I had to see his name thrown in with another classic. Oh well."
2,Is this lead-free?,"Can the manufacturer or distributor verify that this product is lead-free? Is this product manufactured in the USA, or is this imported from China? The FDA has issued warnings concerning products made in China that are potential sources of lead poisoning including children's toys and jewelry, chalk, and glazed pottery (like this one) that have been the subject of recalls in the past. Symptoms from lead poisoning, unfortunately, are slow to manifest until it's too late. Children and the elderly are the most vulnerable."
3,"Price check, please","Only problem is, I can buy these of about $4 at the local Chinese grocery in Chicago. But they are great for cooking."
2,died after a month,"Sent this as a gift to my brother-in-law. It died after only a month. Not sure what went wrong. Embarrassed to have given a lemon of a gift. I will try again with the other brand (Countdown Clock Old Timer's Time to Go Retirement Clock). Originally picked the this one (the failed one) because of it's larger size, but I'm willing to swap size for quality. And the smaller one is cheaper too!In general, the idea is great - if you get one that works! My husband had one (can't remember exactly which brand). It lasted a year and a half and dutifully counted down the days until he retired. Hopefully the next purchase will be a good one."
2,Pray for a better Rock N Roll Film,"While I'll give Gina Gershon credit for trying to come up with a new way of telling the rock dream, I have to say that this piece of product comes up short on original ideas. I know she spent a long time getting to this realization, but more time should have been spent on writing a decent screenplay. The heroine/madonna, herion addict, lesbian couple seems played out.The energy is there, but when you add awful lines about addiction and why these women have stayed so long in the business, not to mention that if they have been prey to to this lifestyle called Rock N Roll, I just don't buy it. Give me something to beleive in."
4,not bad,"I had this for 2 years, it took alot of punishment, got another, didn't last that long. Otherwise, ist's a good product!"
1,Bad B Movie,"You can tell by the cast that this is either a dud or a great movie. With a cast this good and the fact that it went straight to video, it's a dud. It isn't even a good B movie. It's long movie with crappy special effects, awful dialog, even worse story and the acting isn't even on part with a good B movie.Buying this will make you sad."
3,Entertaining sci-fi,"Interesting story, combining futuristic with old, steam-based systems. If you can handle that juxtaposition, then the story is entertaining. Sets are good, bad guys show the budget of the film, but they work. Good characters, good actors (I said good not great). Watch it when you are in a relaxed mood, if you go in looking for flaws, you'll be busy and not enjoying a good casual ride."
2,Nothing but trouble,The first one purchased was so much trouble even Lexmark said it was defective. The exchanged one was no better - wouldn't print more than one page before developing communication errors. Even tried doing a clean install of windows 98 on the computer with no improvement. Not at all impressed with this mfc.
2,You get what you pay for!,"I purchased this printer because I liked the price and the size. I am returning it tomorrow because I have had nothing but problems and the Lexmark tech support is inadequate. The copy and scan functions work great, but everytime I try to print text, I end up with garbage on the printouts(Black boxes, misaligned characters, splotches of color). This printer is also extremely slow. I am tired of wasting my time on it. I think I'll get the HP 2210. It has had much better reviews."
4,Good book to make you think - whether you agree or not,"This starts a dialogue on some of the issues facing dual earner couples. Clearly geared toward the 35-45 year old crowd. Younger women may feel alienated by some of the assumptions that she makes. A great place to start looking at some of the issues yourself, whether or not you agree with her final analysis.For those brought up in a milieu that expected women to do primary parenting, this will be shocking and controversial. She argues that a main issue is whether or not women will let men take care of children. Whether you agree or not with the outcome - she brings up questions that we all should be asking ourselves about the nature of ""fairness"" and ""gender equality vs equity"" - as well as who is really holding back women now?"
2,Barely acceptable.,I have both a DWL-120+ and the DWL-AB650. I am using the wireless adapters with a DI614+ router and neighbors routers.My DWL-120+ detects and uses several available wireless routers besides my own router. The signal detected from my router is consistently weighted at greater than 90% signal strength. The other routers signals are greater than 65% signal strength.My DWL-AB650 consistently detects my routers signal in the range of 50-70% signal strength.The other routers are not detected at all.Dlink tech support has no reasonable fix. I'm a Motorola Radio engineer. Maybe I have high expectations a response to an obviously flawed product by DLink Tech Support.
5,food for your soul,"Mr. Hughes brings a zen like quality to his stories regarding his life and what he was forced to endure. He persevered, triumphed and soared. If you want to feel at peace with yourself this is a book to help you get there. Mr. Hughes is a role model that we should be glad we have. a gracious kind compassionate human. imho ;>)"
3,Right Idea - Bad Packaging,"This book could easily have been half the size without loss of content, due to redundancy and inclusion of irrelevant material such as summaries of mid-east players. However, the fundamental premise is sound and worth noting. Jews might agree on many points up till the final scenario. It would have been useful to include reproductions of some news headlines mentioned, as well as some of the measure for measure repercussions which happened to Israeli leaders who tried forfeiting the Land of Israel, (e.g. Ehud Barak being taken down right after his Camp David surrender and his attempted ""Secular Revolution"").It was annoying to filter through and I had hoped for more, but there were some good gems to be found."
1,He is right it is junk,"Jams too much, and must leave computer on or else you need to reboot windows before you print."
1,It's junk!,This printer came with my new Dell computer back in November. I have had nothing but trouble with this printer. The paper jambs EVERY time I want to print something. And once it jambs the software wants you to delete the program and reinstall.This printer is junk. Spend your money on a different machine.
5,Definitive Classical Text,"These Oxford editions are the definitive Greek texts for Plato's entire body of work. They are the culmination of a vast tradition of scholarly erudition. They include not only a fine edition of the texts, but also an extensive critical apparatus in the footnotes in which alternate readings adopted by other editors are listed. In effect, in this edition, you get the whole history of all other editions of Plato.Oxford is in the process of putting out a new set of re-edited Plato's. These represent the latest trends in scholarly thought on Plato. However they do not represent any new discoveries--they are only a new set of editorial decisions by a new editor, but the same old material. The new set look quite good so far, but the older edition (By John Burnet, or Ioannes Burnet in Latin) are not rendered obsolete or out of date by this one. My personal preference is for the older Burnet edition."
4,Fun and stylish serving dishes,"You'll be the envy of your friends with these...we really like them and get tons of comments...The dishes are shallow--good for things that don't run or ooze over the side...use the serving bowls for mashed potatoes etc, not these.The gray pattern is raised, which makes cleanup a tiny bit harder...that's what lowered the rating to a 4."
1,terrible piece of crap.,"I purchased this item about a month ago, and after only a few uses, the motor has died. I can't even say I got my money's worth because even when it was functioning, the performance was very poor.It looks like fun from the pictures, but it's much larger than I had anticipated, and the shape is actually quite awkward. Also, the intensity of the vibrations are a disappointment, as well. I would not recommend this product to anyone that needs to be done in 30 minutes or less."
2,It doesn't work good,It doesn't work if cold out state(battery dies every time). You can't turn ice alert off...and it is all ways loud
3,Ok for beginners,"liked product, but the rope portion that attaches to the cuff is just a nylon strap and does not have a locking knot or button"
3,Does a great job but...,"I bought this filter about a year ago. It does a great job, I can taste a huge differance. The water flow didnt bother me at first, but after a week the window indicater started to leak. It wasnt bad at first but then it just got worse with time. Now, more water comes around the window than through the filter. I have to clean it all of the time because of the nasty stuff filtered out builds up around the window and the bottom piece where it twists on started to mold. I looked up the filter and found that it's a common problem with this model. It's too much to buy filter after filter if they will all end up the same way. But since it does a good job we've kept it. We just dont turn the filter all of the way down and keep the water flow low, so it takes SO LONG to get a glass of water. I'v been looking at water pitchers just to have a less time consuming way of getting clean water."
2,Not what I expected,"I had tried different face washes but really needed a scrub for my combination oily/dry skin. I get oily but seem to have dry patches with flaky skin, but do not have very sensitive skin. I tried Aveeno and was disappointed. Not only did I think it could have bigger grains to exfoliate, it completely dried out my face and made it feel tight after it was dry. After about a week I tried the Clean and Clear scrub and absolutely love it. So this might be good for people with sensitive skin or who don't want too much in the way of the granules in the product, but it didn't work for me."
1,Does not work,"I have oily, oily, oily skin. I would wash my face with this scrub, go to bed and then wake-up and my face would be extremely oily. It's like my oily glands went into overdrive. I didn't notice any of the skin brightening claims. The only thing I love about this product is the smell. I love the smell and that's it!"
3,Use lightly in the Winter ...,"I normally use this product during the Summer,but was running low and needed to stock up ...Either Aveeno has changed their formula ormaybe because I've reached the age of 50, myskin has less oil on the surface, but I'm finding Idon't need to use much of this product duringthe Winter ...Twice a week is about all it takes,whereas during the Summer, every other day."
5,Great for practicing basic writing,"I got this to work with my 8 yr old son who loves math and reading but thinks writing is a chore. I've tried other writing aids and he seems to think the topics were boring. This one he's taken to much better. It has simple and clear instructions about structuring a paragraph, introduces to different types of paragraphs and has enough practice to get the concept. I'm not a teacher so I don't use the overhead transparancy and I wish I had more pages of drill rather than paying for clear plastic pages. But I'm happy with the quality and results. My son is less resistant to writing and he has a little more informed approach to writing a paragraph."
3,What can I say?,"It works, but it doesn't sound very good, and it's a little windy, even with the cap on. Pop it apart and it's a cheap $2.00 radioshack mic with a case surrounding it basically."
1,Too hard,"I tried this out and then put into the ""useless"" box. The material from which it is made is just too hard. The shape just doesn't work."
5,Very durable,"Great toy for big dogs and very durable. It is heavy and hard, so probably not the best thing to play with indoors if you're playing fetch. My lab pup loves it!"
4,Great for heavy chewer,"MY GSD loves this bone. Like most GSDs she absolutely destroys any normal non ""K9"" type of chew toy. However these last a long time (9 mo at least) and don't form sharp edges until the chew has finally given it's all. If you have a heavy chewer this is a great toy / chewer. Be aware, it's heavy and when your dog drops it on your toe you'll know it."
1,Dog didnt touch it,"Feel I wasted my money on this product, still sits in the house brand new, dog wants nothing to do with it unfortunately :("
3,"Good, but painful!","Ok yes, this is a very durable toy, my dog just loves to chew and this bone lasted for three or four months. I had to throw it away beacuse I would step on it (the white parts are very sharp) or my dog would drop it on my foot, and it would draw blood. Needless to say my feet just could not take any more pain from this bone."
5,Hours & Hours of Entertainment!!!,"My dog is a powerful chewer & has always ruined any toy I have given him within the hour. The Nylabone has lasted since August and still has plenty of life left in it! He has come no where near to destroying this durable toy. He loves his ""nyla"" and chews on it every single day. This toy is a must for any dog owner who is tired of spending their hard-earned money on dog toys only to have them chewed apart in no time!"
1,Nylabone Big Dog Chew Bone,"I did not like this chew bone AT ALL. My poor lab's mouth started bleeding after just chewing a few minutes. My daughter noticed pink in her mouth. After checking the bone I decided to return it. The nubs on the end turned pointed immediately causing the bleeding. I like Nylabone products, just not this one. Amazon sent me a return shipping label and credited my account right away."
2,the ends are not solid,"My 70lb yellow lab is a power chewer, and seems to think her mission in chewing is to pick things apart (like meat off a bone). I've been really pleased with almost all of the Nylabone products that we've given her, and my only reservation with this bone was that she might go on a search and destroy mission on the green part.But what happened instead was that she picked apart the end pieces, getting ""too large to ingest"" chunks off, and revealed the hollow center. I was disappointed."
2,one day later the rubber center is in bits all over my living room floor,"I had such high hopes for this bone! I own a staffordshire bull terrier who is a powerful and voracious chewer. The plastic ends of the bone would be perfect for her, but they put this rubber layer in the middle (the green part) and she has torn it to shreds. I gave it to her last night and this morning I have little green rubber bits all over my floor and she ingested a fair amount of it (says it's non-toxic and hasn't seemed to bother her). In any case, if your dog likes to shred rubber this is not a good option!"
4,My dogs love it!,"I have 3 large Pitbulls who love to chew, and this bone is by far the best one I have found. The green center does come off, but the center of that is not hollow. This bone lasts about 3 months when all 3 have a go at it. I do recommend it!"
5,A great chew toy; has stayed in one piece for quite a long time,"I'm a fan of the Nylabone line of Dura Chews, and this is among my favorites. My dog -- an 80 lb retriever -- loves to gnaw on this bone with his side teeth. He doesn't seem to touch the green center rubber as some other reviewers have noted. But he goes to town on the ends. After two weeks, the bone is still intact, although it does show some signs of wear. I'd say this is a good product for heavy chewers, with the proviso that it (obviously) won't last forever.I'm interested to try Nylabone's other ""heavy chewer"" products after this one."
1,Pilot - Premiere ... Jetsons,"I was under the impression the Pilot/Premiere Episode of the Jetsons was 'Rosey the Robot' aired September 23, 1962.I am a collector and have the Episode."
1,Evening Sun Pieces grow mold,"The evening sun pattern is made out of something called 'earthenware' as compared to Stoneware. These have a greater tendency to absorb and keep water in the area on bottom where they are not glazed, and therefore will have a tendency to grow mold."
2,good cd.very poor audio,great cd but very poor audio quailty.track seven first disk sounds like a bee hive.this is a import cd and it shows.
2,Good when it worked,"Got the item, put it on and did a drop test. Wasn't the fastest nor did I expect that but kept a good rate, mostly faster than most can fire. Worked great for a whole day, great on battery life and everything. Then it took a hit, not to close range of a hit either and it jammed. Never worked again you can tell the motor is trying to work but nothing moves. Took it apart put it back together still nothing. Now it just sits there pretty much a gravity loader now."
1,"I am hearing impaired, considered deaf!","On television this show was captioned but this release of the show for some reason is not captioned and it's of no use to me. Also when I purchased DVD releases on Netflex, they were also in captions, why this isn't in captions is very disappointing and difficult to understand!"
5,Do you like cut flowers?,"I use mine to cut metal molding & other channel/stuff; however, this is the ultimate in cutting the stems of cut flowers. Get the vase ready, trim the leaves to above the water line, cut at a slant, & immediately place the bunch in the water. The flowers last two more days and open faster. So, Guys, when you buy this, do it for her!Lighter, all day with full power, and typical Milwaukee quality...and it does flowers."
5,Fun toy!,"My four-year-old daughter LOVED this book. Several of her friends, male and female, watched her play with it, and they wound up painting different pictures together. It is easy to play with and quite engaging."
4,"A Ruby, A Friend, An Indian, A Girl","Watch Nat and Paulo as they try to keep the secret of a huge ruby entrusted to them by an indian. They must return it by the next moon, but will the schemes of treacherous men succeed? And what about Ruth? Can she help Nat keep the ruby safe? Or will the villains capture her too? If the ruby is not returned in time, will the indians continue on their suicidal mission? And just what does Ruth think of the two young men? Find out by reading this great story of two friends, a ruby, an indian and a girl."
4,A Useful Reading Tool,"As I read the reviews, it is evident that a correction is needed. The underlying text in this book _is_ trustworthy.It varies from the Standard Text (UBS/NA) in 231 places, and has a footnote for each one of those as to the Standard Text's reading.This implies that you can sit down with this resource, and know exactly where it differs from the Standard Text, without needing the Standard Text with you.While I grant it was an odd selection to pick the text based on the preferred readings that went into the NIV, this is by no means a reverse-translated text.Regardless, it has assisted my reading of the GNT greatly, and after going through a trial period of reading it side by side with my NA-27, I think I can move to just the RGNT.Cheers,"
1,This book stinks!,"I got this book thinking it was gonna be a good read. I thought it would have action and good dialogue. But it didn't. What I got was a rotten story that confused me. I think Pras and his unknown partner shouldn't write anymore books. This one was the worst I ever read. Just when you start getting into one character, the writers start spending ten pages telling you about how wooden benches in a church looked. And there were a lot of long words used in the wrong context. It was as if these writers tried to be ""intelligent."" The book has not suspense in it. The ending was also unclear and badly written. Everyone was in one room pointing guns at each other like a Quentin Tarantino movie. This book is played out. I should have known when I saw the writer Pras on the cover in a disco shirt that he's more about style over substance. Save your money and don't buy this."
5,Awesome!!!,"WOW! WOW!! WOW!!! I caught the tail-end of one of Louie Giglio's programs & ordered the DVD immediatly!!I love anything to do with the night sky. This is an amazing program. Even if you're not a believer in God, or Christ Jesus, you will especially enjoy the 1st two DVDs...there are 4 DVDs in the set, 2 have nothing to do with the universe, but are Great to watch anyway! I HIGHLY recommend this set!!Buy the set NOW!!!"
5,Very Satisfied,Excellent message. We had seen a few clips from this DVD (Louie Giglio: The Heart of Passion)and wanted our own copy. Just what we expected at a GREAT bargain.
5,Heart Warming and Mind Expanding,"For Christians, all I can say is that you MUST see this series. It will warm your heart to the greatness, beauty, and wisdom of our God. You will be amazed at visuals (in the first two DVDs) that show creative works of God in our universe that will blow you away. For unbelievers or inquirers, it should move you in the right direction of knowing Him who made all things."
4,Good inspiration,Great if you need inspiration but it's short on how tos. Some of the artists featured here have created true masterpieces. I just wish there was more on how to create your own.
2,Not impressed,"Looks great with the pictures on the web site but I received it to only find that the material used for this comforter set doesn't even come closer to what you'd expect from West Point Stevens. Poor quality material and rough feel. Even if you can adjust with the comforter set, cannot think of embracing the the pillow covers. I wouldn't recommend this product even for 5 dollars!"
1,Don't Bother,"Sorry. If I could give less stars then I would have.I was very disapointed and had to look at Mr. Dalmas peers in the field to see why I didn't like it.First, There is a very large gap of technical knowledge in this book.Cyborgs called Warbots? How are they armored? How are they powered? Can their sensors be disabled, What does a bottled Person think about?What are the capabilities of a warbot?What are the weapons fired by a trooper? What exactly is a pulse? Is this a sonic distruptor or plasma weapon?You have Heavy gravity worlders traing on a lighter world then their own and the drill instructors are also from a weaker world. What problems did it cause? What about hand to hand combat?This book just never lived up to its potential and if I can save anyone from wasting their money on it all the better. In fact I'd be more than will to give you my copy to ready so that you can see what I mean."
1,A wretched excuse of a novel,"As a long-time professional reviewer, I've had the good fortune to read any number of wonderful novels. But luck wasn't with me this time. William F. Buckley's purported historical novel is utterly wretched, either as sound history or as readable fiction. The lapses in drama, dialogue, and characterization are laughable; the liberties taken with historic facts and the reputations of historic personages are unconscionable. The only reason I didn't score this piece of [garbage] a zero here, is that the option wasn't available to me. For my full review of the book, which explains the reasons for my antipathy in colorful detail, go to:[local website]"
5,"Big Dial, Easy to Read","Health-o-Meter HAP200KD-41 Professional Dial Scale, Black and White1. Easy to Read2. Big Numbers3. Big platfrom to stand on4. Nice price"
2,Not Quite Accurate,Both my daughter and I have found some wild variations in the readout from this scale. I would not recommend it for accuracy.
3,Better as a boat anchor,"I've used this scale every day for 3 months and it has to be re-zeroed every time I get on it. The mat is made of thin paper/plastic material which began peeling off immediately. On the plus side, it seems to give consistent weights, +/- a couple of pounds. I won't return it, only because it was free to begin with, using an Amazon coupon."
4,Large but good quality,"This is a large scale that takes up a bit of floor space but it is more reliable than any digital scale I've ever had. It's very helpful to put a strip of sticky note or colored tape on the scale where you put your heels so that you are able to stand in exactly the same place every time you step on, because your position on the scale can make your weight reading vary by up to 4 pounds. I'm not looking for absolute accuracy, but consistency is important. As long as you're standing in the same spot on the scale the readings are very consistent. When you step off the scale make sure the dial goes back to zero. It's easy to adjust. I'd recommend this scale to everyone."
3,Limitations of spring-scale technology,"I usually weigh myself on the doctor's scale at the gym, and I guess I had forgotten the limitations of spring-scale technology. The HAP200KD-41 is sturdy, the dial is easy to read, but the reading can fluctuate by 2 lb or more if you shift your stance. Very annoying when you are trying to monitor weight loss that is probably in the 2 lb per week range. I gave up and bought a digital, having realized that digital technology has improved greatly since I last tried it in a bathroom scale."
3,Quality not very good,Received my order in good time. Light weight flimsy metal. Not very solid. Sticks on low level weights. Hard to adjust to zero because the sensitivy to slight adjustments (10 lbs) is not there. Would not buy again.
4,Questions on Accuracy,"I am very satisfied with it, however.....I am concerned about its accuracy since it dials a weight around ten pounds heavier than an electronic scale I have and one at the sports club. Which is the correct one ? I bought this one because it was advertised as being of ""medical grade accuracy""."
2,Not to be confused with the better Dharma Bums,"Shame that this band didn't bother to do, say, a google search before deciding to name themselves Dharma Bums. A much better band from Portland, OR recorded three terrific albums under the name Dharma Bums for Frontier Records less than ten years ago."
3,A very funny but superficial mystery.,"This is an extremely entertaining book filled with great quotes and interesting characters. The plot builds as it goes along and the mystery of who's trying to kill who all comes to a clear conclusion.So what's wrong? The problem is that all of the characters are flat. None of them go beyond a couple sentences of descriptions. The main character, what'shisface swamp guy, is utterly superhuman. He can do everything, know everything, and even when he gets hurt, he's still Superman(TM). After a while, you start to lose a bit of anticipation because you KNOW he'll do everything right and will come out on top with nary a scratch. He's never really challenged by anyone in this book.Don't get me wrong. You won't regret reading it, because it's very funny and well-plotted. But protagonist's lack of depth was an annoyance."
4,Another super story by Mr. Hiaasen,"Our book club agreed totally that this is another wonderful tale from Carl Hiaasen. I only hope that Mr. Hiaasen exaggerated the amount of corruption in the Miami and Florida. There are enough surprises to keep one involved through all the twists and turns in this delightful story. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed reading a book as much as I did this one. The characters are truly outrageous, funny and very entertaining. A great read."
2,One-Note,"Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil. He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our ""hero"" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place. The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.You can do better."
3,"I love Hiaasen, But....","I've read Hiaasen before this novel, and after. This is his worst, which is still good, but not what you expect from Carl. The hero is infoulable, the crooks are incompatent. Hiaasen's witty writing keeps the book in your hands; but, in the end, you wish you had read any of his other 20 novels."
4,Blue Marlin,The scene with the blue marlin head sets the stage for this romp. I kept waiting for Skink to make an appearance. I'm making myself wait a day or so before starting another one of his newer books I haven't read.I never get tired of reading Carl Hiassen!!
1,Harbor Freight quality,"Seriously, I think they bought these at harbor freight and resold them. The set screws would not hold the drill bit in place from the very first use. I was drilling in very soft wood. After fussing with them for a while I gave up. I suggest you get a set from somewhere that you can vouch for the manufacturer."
1,Zero for customer service,"The first time I used one of these, the drill bit came loose and got stuck in the wood. The set screw will not keep the bit in the sheath. I emailed Anytime tools and got no response. I won't be buying from them Anytime soon."
3,It works,I was aprehensive....but happy I bought this product. Worked as described. Though reather cheaply made. Made in Chi-com land. Could have been made of higher quality steel
5,Great Book,Very pleased with this book. It includes the piano solo for 'scenes from an Italian restaurant'. A good value and great choice for Billy Joel fans.
2,"Wes, Christian, Green, Benson.........","Four of the best jazz guitarists EVER. That would pretty much make Benson the greatest LIVING jazz guitarist. At 61 he gets up one morning and says ""I'm going to get me some more plastic surgery, try to get my first Grammy in 25 years, I record on the preeminent jazz artist label, BUT I WANT TO SOUND LIKE R&B SINGER JOE!!!! Benson describes this sound on his own website as: ""A new millennium sound: smoovey R&B on the jazzy hip hop groove tip"". Believe me this cd was delayed for release THREE separate times-so someone was begging Benson and Verve, ""NO please don't do this!!!"" As a result 3 tracks or so (from the original import release) were dropped and those two sappy ""Sunrise"" tracks were added-well obviously the whole effort is in fact replaceable and Benson may end up on like PEAK, KOCH, NARADA or even CD BABY for his next release...."
3,George Benson,"I've loved George Benson since his ""Breezin"" album way back when. I bought ""Irreplacable"" specifically for ""Softly, As In A Morning Sunrise"". I listened to the whole CD but this is the only cut that I love."
2,Irreplaceable? Not quite.,"Irreplaceable Benson includes ""It's Uptown,"" ""The George Benson Cookbook,"" and Jimmy Smith's ""Off the Top."" On these records, Benson plays like himself, without any compromises. He doesn't try to play what he thinks will sell well. He doesn't constrain his playing to make himself ""accessible"". He just plays some of the best jazz guitar ever recorded.This album gets two stars not because it's bad music. It's better than most of what's on the radio today. It gets two stars because George Benson isn't doing what he does better than anyone else. I don't want to hear a 60-year-old try to keep up with what 20-year-olds are doing. I want to hear Benson playing killer jazz guitar."
3,"Some good exercises, but not always helpful","In some parts a too religious perspective, but contains some ok exercises to help you identify your skills and wants, and gives your more insight into the complete picture of your ideal job. Book is mostly about job finding/applying/negotiating tips. Nice illustrations."
2,My parachute deflated...,I was confused with this workbook from the second I started using it. I didn't find it helpful in the least.
2,"Some diamonds, a lot of rough...","Two stars for practical tips on job-hunting and interviewing. The book starts to lose focus about half way through as it spends several long chapters on things like ""determining what skills you have"" and ""finding out what you want in a job"". These parts were useless for me (but they may be useful for others).My biggest complaint: As other reviewers pointed out, at the very end of the book, the author totally shifts gears and delivers an utterly inappropriate Christian sermon as a 20-page epilogue. Regardless of your own religious beliefs, you will find the change in tone from the last chapter to be very jarring, and you will wonder if you are still reading the same book. Where was the editor when he slipped THIS into the presses?"
2,"Alot of pages, little content.","Parachute had a lot of ""fluff"" and rambleing in it. Also the exercies in the book all did the same thing and seemed rather pointless. Several situations seemed unrealistic and some of his suggestions for the interviews may make the interviewer somewhat rude. It applys that everyone in the working feild is going to help you out as much as they can even though they never meet you before."
2,This book does not apply to all,"As a professional with graduate degrees in business and science, I was extremely disappointed in this resource for 3 reasons. One, the ""language"" of the book is characteristic of grade schools texts and inherently instills doubt in the books arguments, objectives and goals. Two, the statistics compiled in the text are outdated and discounted by the author on multiple occasions. Finally, and most importantly, the resource appears to be most applicable to those in the blue collar field. Many examples and self-marketing strategies target positions or firms which require less education and even experience.Overall, the book is written at a level for children and suggests strategies that are great if you are not a well educated and seasoned professional. For a book that generates 20,000 copy revenues per month, I was shocked. This text is not for a seasoned professional contemplating a vertical or horizontal career change."
5,Taking charge through self analysis,"Everyone who works (and who doesn't?) should read this book. I consider it the most important book of its kind on the market today, and one of the top five books that will influence your daily life simply because so much of who we are is governed by what we do for a living. To effectively use the book, you must do the tasks that are outlined within it. This takes time, but is well worth the effort. What you learn about yourself may surprise you. It will certainly be useful when you go on interviews or consider changes in your career path."
1,Didn't live up to the hype,"After hearing so much about this book, I was excited to give it a try. I really should have listened to the bad reviews - it was terrible.I don't have anything new to say that hasn't already been mentioned in the other negative reviews, except that this is really more of a job-hunting manual than a guide to fresh thinking about your career. If you want to know how to prepare for an interview, fine. But if you are looking for a new direction in your life, you won't find it here.If you really want to do some self-assessment, skip this one and go straight to the What Colour is your Parachute workbook. It's much cheaper and gives you the same exercises without all of the author's self-satisfied rambling."
1,It didn't give me a clue as to which direction I should go!,"I read the book. I came out of reading it even more confused. It was too religious. The book also contained ""facts"" that were untrue. I would give it two thumbs down!"
1,How do I get the job to sweep the streets?,"Little insight. The book would probably give you an understanding how to become a nightwatch or a janitor at summer school, but forget about anything else. Childish excitement. Not worth the money."
5,WOW...Nicole does it again,"In my opinion I think Nicole just keeps getting better and better. I'm not going to repeat the storyline, the other reviewers have already done that.This book grabbed my attention from the very first page. Trey and Antonia are two amazing characters. Trey is every girl dream guy who wants to save everyone. Antonia is a merchant daughter who promises her father to marry into nobility. Even though Trey shows his feelings first, it takes Antonia a little longer to finally admit her feeling for Trey. The sex scenes are hot hot hot and done with class, especially the swimming lessons.Looking forward to reading Ryder's story next."
5,basics of copperplate calligraphy,"In calligraphy, it is important to learn a technique as copperplate because it makes a more well-rounded calligrapher. It is used in addressing envelopes, signing certificates, or any work that uses formal script. This book calls for a Mitchell copperplate pen point and covers basic strokes, minuscules, joining letters, and numerals."
2,cheesy cheesy,"The reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is because the antagonist's costume was phat. If I had clothes like that I'd wear the hell out of them. As for the rest of the movie I laughed and grinned because it was amusing. I mean no matter how hard I tried to get scared, it just wouldn't happen. Rent this one, but I'd not recommend purchasing it."
4,funny in a really stupid way,"This movie was funny but in a rediculous sense, it was very outrageous, but is fun to watch with a group of people."
2,Low Budget horror only for the most hardcore horror fans,"I didn't rent this movie with high hopes and you shouldn't either. An undead soldier rises from the grave to murder those he finds ""unpatriotic"". I feel like this movie was just an excuse for somebody to make a horror movie that revolves around the Fourth of July. The acting was wooden and the kills were lackluster. If your a true horror fan like myself and have time to kill give it a watch, if not look elsewhere."
4,Surprisinly good...,"Whwn i bought this movie i did so with causion.i mean its a horror called uncle sam about a zombie.all that doubt when out the window when i saw its writen by larry cohan and directed by william lustig.they did all three maniac cop movies which i also think are good.after seeing the movie i can honestly say its a good movie.it dosent drag,the pacing is good and boy is uncle sam vicious with his kills.there arent many kills in this film but when they do happen they are bloody with nice gore.this was just a refresing addition to the tired zombie genre and a worthy addition to my horror collection.any horror or slasher fan will enjoy this movie."
4,Greater than the sum of its parts,"If you look at this album track-by-track, you'll find a few great ones, many good ones, and a couple duds. The album brings them together in an evocative way, though, to really give you nice hour of belief suspension. The conceit of recreating Christmas in a medieval Irish castle is more subtle than I expected: You get a few bits of narration at the beginning, but that overarching idea is conveyed much more by the music and the style than by any overt content. And the album occasionally strays from its theme, like when the bard and poet exchange ideas in the pub. In all, I give the album four stars, even though the average of all its tracks is probably three stars.A bit more detail: I always put my albums on iTunes so I can rate, sort, and playlist-ify the individual songs. This CD probably produced about half ""Christmas"" songs and half ""Irish/traditional"" songs. Most of them got three stars, with a few getting four and a few getting two."
3,DAoC Catacombs,Catacombs basically renders all the old zones useless. Why waste time in them when you can level up twice as fast running the insta dungeons. The new Catacombs areas themselves are pretty boring and ill conceived. Pretty stupid release imo but at least it makes the grind to 50 alot easier.
3,Fun piece of camp!,"Santo Contra Capulina(1968, Santo Versus Capulina) is a misleading title as both A List Mexican movie stars of the 1960's fight on the same side.Santo, a Mexican wrestler, and Capulina, a half-witted security guard, team up to battle a mobster and his gang of androids! If the plot sounds silly, it's supposed to be! Camp and El Santo go together like bacon and eggs! Face the facts: Santo movies are not exactly works of art. There's a neat animated credit sequence done in the vein of The Pink Panther. Watching Santo battle a well-endowed, sexy, female android was like something out of Austin Powers. Manuel Esperon's music score reflects the lightweight feel of the movie. SCC is worth watching every now and then."
5,A great soundtrack for a great movie!!,This soundtrack was great! It went perfectly with the movie! Two thumbs up!
5,I love this soundtrack!,"When I first saw the movie last year, I immediately fell in love with him and the music. I was humming the music all the way home. Jeremy sumpter is hott, I love the music also. Espescially the flying music, which plays in alot of the filf including when wendy kisses peter. :D"
3,"Eh, not as good as Treasure Planet",Don't get me wrong it is good music but it sound too much like his score for Disney's Treasure Planet which is remarkable!
4,A good story,"This is the 2nd Novel in the Xanth series. While not one of my favorites, it is still a worthy addition to the series. In this book, we follow Bink on his quest to find out where the magic of Xanth comes from."
2,Simplistic yet entertaining,"I found this novel enjoyable, but I'm not sure that I can continue with the series. I feel like each book will be more of the same. Go here, run into strange creatures, escape from danger, talk about attractive or irritating females, solve problem, return home. The characters aren't very interesting, and Xanth is no more unique than it was in the previous novel. These stories would be better with a force of evil or sense of purpose. The puns are amusing at times and irritating at others. Overall, these books are decent light reading, and would serve you well for a brief escape into a different world."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,The product sent was not the product ordered. They sent a Pur 1-stage filter when a Pur Advantage was ordered. Three attempts were made to contact the seller via Amazon e-mail and they never responded. Order from this seller at your own risk.
2,It's your money,"You do know you can achieve the same thing with a regular 12"" bike right? Just leave off the pedals and the training wheels. When they're ready, you put the pedals back on and they can ride a 2 wheeler. Worked for my 3 year old twins. AND we saved the extra expense of having to buy one of these […] balance bikes. […] you've got 2 bikes in one. I mean it's your money, I'm just sayin..."
3,Served it purpose but didn't last,"I bought this for my kids. 2 of them learned to balance on this bike and the others didn't because it wasn't durable enough to last. The handle bars are quite stiff and didn't turn easily which was good and bad. Hard to maneuver but also hard to jack knife when you're just starting out. It was left in the rain twice and that was enough to pretty much wreck the bike. The idea is great and it worked for the kids that used it but overall I ended up buying a different brand of balance bike that had a real seat, was more adjustable and could weather the elements better. If you only have one kid and monitor everything then this bike will be great for you. If you're like the rest of us I'd recommend a more durable balance bike for your kid(s)."
3,Ok read.,A bit 'heavy' for what I thought it would be. It's a wonderful class resource for the teacher to use.
2,not enough repetition,"Maybe it's good to refresh your German but to learn it from the beginning you should listen the same part of the tape over and over again.Pro:- Good chance to hear how the native Germans speak.Cons:- Each new word is pronounced only once. It would be better to listen it again after you tried to repeat it.- In the end of each lesson you are asked to take part in the dialogue, but you don't know exactly what you should say after you heard the saying of the another person.- The music after each small part of the lesson is annoying.So, if you really want to learn German while driving or jogging, then buy Pimsleur course instead."
4,Gritty Song Writer that will grow on you,"I bought this album not knowing what to expect. It's the kinda gambling I like to do; go to the music store and browse, find something that looks interesting and plop down my bucks. Usually I do pretty well and this turned out to be a good album. And it's been growing on me. Some albums are immediate hits, some never make it to my listening cycle and others I'll keep going back to and they eventually strike me. That's what this album does. If you like songer/songwriters with a gritty style and have the patience to delve into the material buy this album."
5,A marvelous recording!,"Of my vast CD collection, this CD is quite simply my favorite! Paul Rutman's sensitive interpretations, coupled with his dazzling technique make this recording a rare gem."
3,interesting in light of recent events,"The novel, while well written, is a bit dry and observational. However, the ideas it presents, notably what discourse an oppressed people has, have parallels with situations in the West Bank and Sept 11."
4,TD lost.,"Don't have a copy but log in and listen occasionally for some excellent music by one of the ""GREATS""who will never be forgotten by those who remember the '30s and '40s. Someone needs to reissue thisCD and provide a treat for music lovers."
1,not as comfortable as my other slip ons by sketchers,i live in slip on sketchers.they're all i wear around the house and i've had many styles but never on that was uncomforatable that i didn't feel sturdy in. My calves are sore from illness and that's why i wear sneakers but these made my calves ache after only a few minutes it felt like i had worked out. I also didn't notice when ordering them that they had laces which i didn't like..the end kept getting stuck in the shoe. I will give these to charity and use my other sketchers slip ons. These were the only uncomforatable ones i ever bought from this brand.Also they ran a bit small.
5,have worn these shoes for years,I am a nurse and on my feet all day. I love these shoes for their arch support and the fact that I can kick them off when I sit down to do my charting.
5,Great shoes /Great seller,I love these shoes. I wear them all the time. I can walk and my feet don't hurt. I have so many shoes I can't wear.I get fast response from the seller on Amazon. Shoes are perfect and fast delivery.
2,Blah Blah Blah,"I don't really care to enter the fray that this book seems to have caused, but having read it and having expected something more from it, I guess the only thing I learned was that the old adage about judging a book by its cover (or in this case its title) is true. Other marketing books make mistakes by overloading on case studies. This one does the exact opposite. I can't understand why an author of a book like this wouldn't use case studies on every page (a la Seth Godin's Purple Cow) to make his points unless he's either A) afraid that if he uses an actual client example someone will check up and find something negative or B) that there simply are no case studies to prove his point.By the way, I am not an ad agency employee or a marketing expert. I am simply a businessperson who feels like this book does not deliver on what it appears to promise."
2,Not as good as advertised,"The impetus for purchasing the book was the glowing testimonials on the back from reputable marketing experts. Not sure what they saw in it, though.Pretty basic stuff."
1,This book sucks,"This book is like one of those diet books that spends a lot of space telling you how great the diet plan is. In fact, the first 46 pages of the book tell you almost nothing, except how the author will let you know how to market your company in upcoming chapters. Again, like a diet book, he has come up with a cute term to sell books: ""Extreme Marketing."" And like those diet books, which can be summed up with, ""eat fewer calories than you burn, and exercise for your health,"" his ideas are simplistic. Here is the summary:- Make sure your marketing activities are accountable for sales. Any marketing activity should have a direct correlation to increased sales and a measurable return on investment (ROI).- Use multiple marketing activities at the same time for the best results.- Make sure you have the trained salespeople to follow up on marketing activities and close the sale.That's it. While good advice, it doesn't justify a whole book. But, neither does, ""eat less, exercise more."""
1,This Book Sucks,"The general idea of using ROI methods for determing marketing budgets and activities is good, but nowhere to be found. The entire book is generally a plug for Mr. Stevens and his company. Frankly I would not hire his firm based on the examples of his own firm. Congratulations to Mr. Stevens for convincing the publisher to publish this self promoting book."
5,A phenomenal selection,"Mark Dynamix and John Course have excelled themselves with this album, a fantastic selection of tracks that draws from a huge range of dance influences from all over the world. The variety in this album is just amazing - I never tire of listening to it. One of my favourite albums ever, and one that had me eagerly waiting for the 2005 annual."
2,Australian editions are the best it seems,this 2004 annual is better than the 3 cd british one by far.
5,Great product,"I've been using this sunblock for 4 years now, and definitely love it. It doesn't have that greasy feel like other ones I've used."
5,Only for serious sunblock,"I received a sample of this product at a trade show a number of years ago. I have what you would call mild rosacea. If I get any type of over exposure to the sun my face really shows it. This product will totally stop this. Yes, it does have a film, but not like the lifeguards wear on their noses. If you apply it sparingly in a thin layer and massage it in, it will blend in well. It does not take much to offer you complete protection. If you have mild rosacea it will actually lighten up your skin a tad, and for many of us this is not totally undesireable. I only use it on my face and ears which are problem areas for me. I enjoy the outdoors (Cancun vacations, fishing, hiking, working in the garden) without worry that my face will turn beet red and remain that way for days or weeks to come. I use this product regularly, and would not be without it when I travel or if intend to be outdoors."
5,loving it...,"I absolutely love this product. I have been using this product for five years now. It does give your face a little white tint when you apply it, and you have to blend really well, especially near the hairline. I have oily t-zone, so it was a bit oily for me sometimes. But now I found that if I apply my vitamin c serum first, and then this, it balanced it out. No more oiliness."
2,Runny but sticky,I was looking for a good total block. I still got freckles with this block even when using it diligently. It is kind of runny but very sticky.. If it spills on anything it is hard to get off.
4,Early Comprehensive Brazilian Cookbook in English,"This is a comprehensive book on Brazilian cooking, in English, with many recipes unavailable elsewhere. Howevers, readers should note that it was written in 1961, when many typical Brazilian ingredients weren't available in the U.S. or elsewhere, and the author has made adaptations, without mentioning what the original ingredient was! Brazilian ingredients are more widely available now, and you can usually figure out what the proper authentic ingredient is, especially by comparing the recipes in this book to those in more recent cookbooks. One tip -- in most cases where the author calls for parsley, you should really use cilantro (coentro in Portuguese). It would be wonderful if the publisher would issue an updated version of the book with authentic ingredients substituted back into the recipes, but this is still VERY useful. In particular, the section on desserts is excellent, but there are many other wonderful recipes here."
3,"DAVID, MAX, SIMON AND THE OTHERS","FATHER AND SONS, the first movie of Michel Boujenah, got two nominations for the 2003 French Academy awards, in the Best First Work and Most promising Actor (Pascal Elbé) categories, but won none. It's not an unforgettable film but I don't regret to have spent 90 minutes watching it. Philippe Noiret can be as poignancy as well as funny and the actors who play his sons are perfect in their role. It's a light-hearted comedy which, like all good comedies, says important things with a smile.A DVD zone Simpsons."
2,Weak on grammatical notes,"I used this text alongside of Cerutti's Pro Archia (2nd ed.), and I found Frerich's edition of the First Catillinarian to be sorely lacking in comparison. First, the running vocabulary is presented alphabetically on each page, not by line number, extending the time it takes to find words. This may sound minor, but it makes a difference over the course of several hundred lines. But more significantly, the notes were too few and far between. After a while, I found myself forgetting to check the grammatical notes because most of the time, they didn't address the problem with which I was working. Cerutti's Pro Archia notes, on the other hand, were copious and much more detailed. So in summary Frerich's edition is useful in so far as it gives running vocabulary and a few grammatical notes, but I would choose many other annotated editions before his."
1,There are alternatives...,"If you're looking for a story of a true American screwball who is undermining her country (and her son's heroism), definitely buy this book! However, for a more accurate depiction of Casey Sheehan, I recommend the shorter version written by Ann Coulter. The story of this great American hero who died nobly for his country (and his mother's career as a left-wing puppet) is captured in pages 126 through 131 of ""Godless."""
1,Pathetic,"Poor Casey, gave his life for America, a cause his mother then devoted her life to bashing. Now she uses his casket as her platform to oppose the very ideals her son died to protect.What could a mother possibly do that would disrespect her child more than this? If William Shakespeare were alive today, probably he'd base his next tragedy on this pathetic creature, Cindy Sheehan."
4,nice reprint of 1968 edition,"This book provides a history of Egyptian writing, scribes, hieroglyphs, grammar, numbers and gods. It also includes an interesting section of English-hieroglyphs vocabulary. The authors tell the readers about the decipherment of the ancient language and its importance. Well illustrated, this is a wonderful introductory book, for new students."
5,Great read!,"This was really a great book! I kept expecting something bad to happen to Cameron, I guess because young black men that grow up in the hood are usually stereotyped as troublemakers. I was glad to see that he stayed on track and became a successful man the right way. Loved it!"
1,I.wanted my money back,Things In Between is part 2 to Married to a Married Man and to be honest I was sooo disappointed in this book that I actually wanted my money back. First off the book was short and I wished so bad thatit went more in depth into the story like there was much more could have been writen thy I acttually wanted to write more on the story myself. Like in part 1 Cameron meets Deans daughter nd I so wished that tha could have played out in the book. All n all its a waste to get this book but part 1 was soooo good tho
3,Good product but tiny amount for price,I was just expecting a larger amount of product for this price. I guess I should of double checked how many ounces it was. Next time I will just shop at the drugstore and get more than double the amount for the same price.
2,Not really for a total beginner.,"This book appears to be designed to be a supplement for a class. It is difficult to follow, does not address the use of chinese characters, and is weak in the pronucation. Admitly this is a problem for any book on chinese that does not come with audio tapes. However, for 30 dollars one expects more."
2,lol,"first of all, I am vietnamese. and yes we share boarders with china and have adapted thier culture to our food. however, I skimmed the book and I saw an overwhelming amount of recipes with soy sauce. fish sauce is primary seasoning in viet cooking. the author does not also even distinguish the use of light vs dark soy.moreover, some recipes used shortcuts suchas the mainstream dish ""pho"". using these shortcuts are not only a cop out but also do not develop your skill for seasoning/tasting with REAL ingredientsthis maybe a good intro for noobs but there are more authentic viet cookbooks out there( but then even those phave flaws)"
2,Philips RC9800i,"not bad remote, especially the Wi-Fi Feature and the fact that it can view media center information (pictures, Music info) but unfortuantely its very weak on macros or multiple actions with one key stroke. the new version of this (Pronto) is much better but much more expensive so i ended up getting the Logitech Harmony 1000."
5,An Incredible Little Piece of Literature,"Being a lover of nearly all things Jamesian, this is yet another masterpiece that juxtaposes a painfully plain heiress against her newly found passion. James is as lyrically splendid as always and it's definitely worth a read.... I think if I would have changed anything I would have loved for it to be longer, in fact."
4,What was I afraid of?,"The focus of this entire novel is money. But James manages to craft a tale that explores not only wealth, how it is used and what it means, but social class, family structure, filial obedience, parental responsibility, and strength of character. Catherine may be described by everyone as ""sweet, but simple,"" but she has a will of steel, and will show her father that he has grossly underestimated her.Honestly, I don't know why I waited so long to read a Henry James novel. For some reason I thought he would be ""difficult,"" with long, complicated sentence structure and archaic language. If you have the same notion, get over it. This is a very approachable story. I was engaged and interested from the beginning. Of course, now I've added more Henry James to my tbr mountain ... but I think that's a good thing."
5,A page-turner,"Very tightly written with an mesmerizing plot, I found compelled to read it virtually in one sitting. H. James captured the emotions of a father trying to ""protect"" his only daughter from a vulture suitor. I felt very much the same when my daughter became engaged to marry a non-descript yokel."
4,WASHINGTON SQUARE,"THE CHARACTERS WERE VERY WELL DRAWN< ALTHOUGH FRUSTRATING AT TIMES< THE HEROINE""S PERSONALITY WAS WELL DEVELOPED AS SHE MATURED> AT THE CONCLUSION HER CONTENTMENT WITH HER LIFE WAS SATISFYING>"
3,Relationships,"Being that the Heiress was on broadway, thought I would enjoy reading Henry James book. It tookA few chapters, but finally got into it and enjoyed it."
1,great title sad book,"i am sorry i ever paid for this book. it must have been a rush or something the first book was great, then this very sad"
2,Psychic UFO Channelling,Not my cup of tea for a UFO book. This one is mostly about psychic channelling and has stories about some people coming from the stars to save us. Not really my cup of tea for a UFO book but some of you out there might like this sort of thing.
4,Very Oriental: black for white,"In traditional western culture ""White Magic"" is good magic and Black Magic is evil. In oriental mythology there is a reversal as in this world. L. E. Modesitt has done an amazing job of constructing a mythology and world withhis own rules and physical laws. The young Lerris never has a chance: even his family has kept what they are and what he could become from him.So the novel is the coming of age of a wizard in a very hostile world mostly ruled by his deadly enemies, the white wizards of chaos.He is refused a journeymanship that he has actually earnedand sent to the outside world on a dangergeld quest.He is sent out into the chaos that balance with order on Recluse has created.Against all odds he overcomes...I like the style and techniques of this writer."
3,almost gave it four starts but ...,I almost gave this book four stars but I was driven to near insanity by Lerris's continual complaints and the exhaustive attencion to detail given by this book. Do we really need to hear about how he made a wood box for more than a page? I loved the magic and the balance of Order and Chaos however. It kept me reading.
2,"not bad, but not great","This book is hard to describe. It's certainly not the worst fantasy I've ever read, but it's far from the best. The writing is uneven. The characters are extremely blase about events around them and don't bother questioning a lot of what happens. The main character, Lerris, just suddenly has magical powers that should be astonishing and he merely yawns as if he knew and goes about making a table. Having said all that, the story is interesting in parts and it moves along.The worst things about L.E. Modesitt's writing are the sounds. He gives sound effects to every tiny stupid thing in the book. Every time the horse whinnies, it has an imitation sound that no real horse would make. A door slams and there's the attempt to make the noise into words. It's very distracting and pointless. I became very frustrated with this style very quickly.On the whole, it wasn't a bad way to spend a few days. But I don't think I'll be reading anymore about Recluce in the future."
1,Worst book in print?,"I was marginally interested in the whole chaos-order premise and found his home isle to be interesting for the first 50 pages of 3rd grader narrative description, but I found myself hating every pathetic excuse for a character in the book.Also the horse going Whheeeee....eeeee....eeeee.....eeeee with the noises spelled out is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in print, though I am sure it is not intended to be.Every attempt at characterization is pathetically weak, and I cannot think of a single character with a noticable personality.Also, I am sick and tired of all-powerful characters as this eliminates any suspense.I am cursed in that I never stop reading a book once I pick it up, but at the conclusion of this one I hurled it with great force."
5,"Finally, a new and original twist to the fantasy genre. . .","THE MAGIC OF RECLUCE brings a whole new approach to the magic contained in typical fantasy novels. The magic in this novel is divided into three catagories: white is chaos, black is order, and grey is both. Mr. Modesitt goes into great length describing the rules of these magics, and one of the most interesting ideas that he presents is that order and chaos cannot exist without one another. Mr. Modesitt also presents a large stock of characters with whom it is easy to relate, especially to the main character because the first person narraration allows us to know what he is thinking and identify with him. The only problem I had with this story was that it could run a bit slow at times, but never to the point of boredom. I would recommend this story to any fan of hard core fantasy, or even to someone who is just beginning to explore the genre"
1,Disappointed,"Library binding is not worth even the price of a paperback - which is what it is. They take a paperback, cut off the paper margin edges, and somehow bind it in a cheap cardboard binding.I'd give it 0 stars if I could.The book, by Modesitt, would be well worth the investiment in a regular paperback or a real hardcover."
1,Dull meets pointless,"If there's a point to this meandering, repetitive, and banal ""epic"" I certainly missed it. The author spends almost more time talking about what the main character eats than on what he feels or seeks. The moralism isn't even two dimensional and the characters in general fail to engage either the reader's interest or sympathy. The reveals come out of nowhere, as do the character's various triumphs; right after he gets done telling us how lost and hopeless he is, he goes out and decimates the fearsome enemy.I kept hoping it would get better, but this trudge never really picks up the pace."
1,Buy the new 160GB 5000DV!,This one is an obsolete from Maxtor.It has only 2MB buffer memory.Don't buy it!Buy the new 160GB 5000DV with 8MB buffer memory!
2,Buy a Fire Wire instead,"I wonder how many people who write these reviews still feel the same after a few months. Initially was THRILLED with a fast- portable hard drive to use as an archive for home and office....until it started filling up...so to speak.with only about 9gb on the disk, it makes starting up Windows about a 10-12 minute wait while it ""scans"" all the data on the Maxtor. Once opened, the transfer/access rate is like working on an old 386 machine... and it's 10 times worse with a USB 1.1 connection!I thought for CERTAIN that the problem was me. I defragged, rebooted, deleted half the files..... no luck.Stay with a fire wire, especially if you are replaying any music or video. Can't imagine someone using this thing to do a presentation.Mine is now a pretty paper weight."
5,I feel safe,Followed the instruction on where to plug it in and have the reassurance of the lights that it works fine...
2,It's only alive while Ravelstein is,"In this faux memoir, Bellow gives us Abe Ravelstein, a fascinating, infuriating and ultimately delightful character. This is the book's problem. Being so much larger than life, Ravelstein's presence overwhelms all the other characters so that they totally disappear into the background. When Ravelstein dies, the book for all intents and purposes ends as an interesting read. It limps along with Chick's own brush with death which just feels tacked on. I am aware that this book has a basis in reality, but it just doesn't hold together well. The character that Bellow has created in Ravelstein; regardless of his origin, deserved better."
3,What's the point?,"Eh... This is the first book of Saul Bellow's that I have read. I can say this - it got me interested in reading Plato.Mostly this story centers on Ravelstein, a political philosopher, and his friend 'Chick', whom he has asked to write his biography. Throughout the book we learn the type of person Ravelstein is, which is not the most likable, and then near the end of the book it switches focus entirely and we are given an account of Chick's near-brush with death. Why? Am I missing something?I found this book to be anticlimactic. One thing that irked me is this: There are people in this world who focus on their identity with one group, be it race, religion, or class, and never leave that fact. It is always in their speech. They keep coming back to it. You can't get them away from it. Such is the case with this book, the fact here being one of Jewishness.There are flashes of great writing in 'Ravelstein', but not enough to overcome the irritations."
2,Left me cold,"Perhaps because I thought I was reading a novel and not a thinly disguised biography of someone Bellow knew (and whom I do not), Ravelstein left me cold. Bellow has always been a favorite of mine, and I picked up this book with great anticipation, read it, and put it down with great disappointment. (Maybe I missed something, but what WAS all that rambling off at the end about Chick's fish poisoning?).I'll stick with Henderson the Rain King and Humboldt's Gift, thank you."
4,Could have been a masterpiece,"Bellow was off on a good track with Ravelstein. He had set up this work to be a kind of Jewish-American Great Gatsby; the first person narrator, Chick, was the channel through which the reader explores Ravelstein, and through him, late 20th century America. Unfortunately, Bellow disposes of Ravelstein too early in the narrative. The work then becomes about Chick, his marriage and near death. In the end, there is the feeling that this novel veered off track; that Bellow made promises to the reader that he did not keep."
2,"Fine, but lacking in depth","Saul Bellow's slim eulogy to the late Allen Bloom in novel form has its moments, but it is ultimately a superficial achievement. Banking on the colorful eccentricities of the late professor of philosophy, Bellow is content to retreat from anything resembling a story. I preferred the intricate weavings of philosophy, art, and life that Bellow was able to create and Herzog, whereas in Ravelstein he takes it for granted that the subject is supremely interesting to the reader. Still, I admit that Bellow is quite at home in the elite intellectual circles that Bloom liked to frequent at the University of Chicago, and his pedantic monologues about the ancient Greeks, Rousseau, and Machiavelli have a certain amount of resonance. But this is still a well-written puff piece at the end of the day."
3,"A well written, very depressing book","Having read ""The Closing of the American Mind,"" I was very saddened to see how little Alan Bloom/Abe Ravelstein differed from his ""flat-souled"" students. Despite his brilliant analysis of his students in ""Closing,"" it is apparent that his human feet of clay undermined his philisophical insights. Bloom is depicted as self-centered, greedy, gluttonous and prone to heavy gossiping ... It is a very sad tale if you, like me, loved ""Closing."" I still love ""Closing,"" but I am now more aware than ever, that philosopy is not enough to lead to a truly virtuous life."
2,Slow.....Dull......,"Can someone explain to me why this book has gotten glowing reviews and high praise? I've read half of the book and so far, nothing has happened. So OK, Ravelstein is supposed to be Allan Bloom and he's brilliant and witty and Bellow loved him. I am not charmed by Ravelstein/Bloom's charm and scintillating conversation, alas. Bellow also is taking the opportunity to trash his ex-wife in a very nasty and unpleasant way. (Do we really need to hear about her pubic hair? ) My recommendation: if you're curious and want to read it, DON'T pay big bucks for the hardcover. Get it from the library because you probably won't be able to finish it any way."
3,Too small...,"If you have big hands, don't bother. I got this to entertain the baby. Yeah, I can only use a thumb to move one of the little arms(can't do both). The mouth on the doll also is very hard to manipulate. It does seem well made though."
3,Not great,"This is a good looking item but, picture is not as item is. Does not seem to be form fitting to my hood. 2006 colorado. Has space between the protector and the hood on the sides,where dirt can build up."
1,Cheap looking pot_don't buy,"I just got the medium sized clay pot. It does not look like the one in the picture at all! The surface of the pot was so rough (both inside and outside) that it looks like a pot you would use for plants. And honestly, i would not even use it to plant flowers because it looked so cheap and ugly.I got this from MV Trading. I wonder if the seller is making counterfeit products. Definitely a total disappointment."
3,Item sent is NOT as advertised by you !!!,"The product mailed to me did NOT include a secure digital 2.0 Gigabyte card as advertised by you, but only a secure digital 1.0 Gigabyte card.As you are well aware the price of a 1.0 Gigabyte card is NOT the price of a 2.0 Gigabyte card !!!Thanks."
5,Great drum set,"We looked at a ton of drum sets before deciding on Silvertone's. My son has been taking lessons for 3 years and it was time for a full set to practice on at home. So we wanted a good starting set that wouldn't break the bank. This drum set exceeded my expectations. It arrived quickly, my 13 year old had no trouble setting it up and the sound is great. I think it is a excellent value for the price."
5,Plug and Play,This truly is a plug and play accessory for my 09 Tacoma. The only improvement I would like to see is a more refined factory-like end unit to tidy things up a bid.
2,"Hopkins Plug-In Simple 43355 T Connector Wiring Kit For Toyota T100, '94-98","Just ordered my second one, trying to figure out return policy, if I can return the first one. Bought first one in May. Ordered second one in Oct. Right turn signal quit working on the converter, thought it was the trailer or the truck, but after putting the checkers and the meters on everyhting narrowed it right down to the converter. If I have better luck with the next one, I will write a better report, or if I have another bad experience, I will have a lot worse report..........."
5,Love Elmo,"Our 18 month old grandson loves this. We often Skype him and I greet him with Elmo saying ""hello"". If I forget, he says ""where Melmo?"" It is so cute."
2,not great,"the mouth of elmo is hard to open and the arm holes are difficult to put your fingers in, and it does look just like the picture"
1,Elmo Gund hand puppet,"I am quite dissapointed with this Gund Elmo Hand Puppet as it shows its mouthwide open, but when you use it - it does not open wide, in fact it is difficultto open. Rating - poor!"
3,"Cute, but hard to ""puppet""","We bought this for my son because he LOVES Elmo. If that weren't the case, though, we probably wouldn't play with it much and I'll tell you why: Elmo's mouth (the black, inside part) is made of two plastic pieces that have been attached on the back (hand) side. The way they attached the two pieces makes it difficult to open his mouth very wide.Also, if you really get your hand in there to get the mouth going, it's near impossible to control/move the arms. Maybe I just have small hands.Bottom line: it's a cute toy. It's a little difficult to ""puppet"", but my son loves it, so we still play with it."
3,Cheesy but Funny,This movie isn't going to give you any meaningful revelations. I admit it is cheesy but if you take it with a grain of salt and just have fun this movie was funny.
3,Average,"Average as far as sequels go. If you like lots of skin & little plot, then you'll enjoy this movie (even if you didn't see the first one). They had to find a way to kill off most of the original cast to make this work. That should give you some idea."
1,Stunk,"Clichéd, pointless, hopeless plot, disgusting raunch.. Misses the mark completely. I am so glad I did not buy this movie.The first one was great!It is not even worth penning a decent review or spell check. lol"
1,YUCK HORRIBLE TERRIBLE,"After immensely enjoying the first movie, we were not only disappointed but often disgusted by the second. Instead of making witty and funny movie like the first, they made a stupid, crass and gross movie.don't waste your time or money on this!"
1,Sophomore effort earns an F,"Jonah Blechman & Scott Thompson reprise their roles from the original Another Gay Movie. Otherwise, nobody else returns for this sequel...and after watching it I understand why. Bad writing coupled with inept acting has created an awful movie. RuPaul and Lady Bunny both have supporting roles. RuPaul is the highlight of the whole movie and Lady Bunny is good but I just didn't like her character.The main premise is our quartet is reuniting for Spring Break in Florida. They are competing for the title: Miss Gay Gone Wild by sleeping with as many people as possible. Unfortunately, the movie is neither clever nor funny, it just has lot's of humping and nudity. While the first movie was fun with high production values, this didn't live up to that same standard."
2,Kinda disapointing,"The first part was so funny, that I thought this one would be 10 times better, was I disapointed!! They use a lot of disgusting things to try to make it funny, and yes that means ""Perez Hilton"" in a ton of scenes. Someone needs to tell that man, when you are dead lie down! There was also annoying product placement. It is a shame!! They should have followed what Eating Out did with their sequel. That was a true gay sequel!!"
2,Lame!,"The second installation of the ""Another Gay"" movies was pretty lame... Don't think you're buying a movie with the same characters... Only one of the original 4 boys is the same... the ""replaced"" the others... It was pretty dumb and not worth the money... certainly don't buy it..."
3,It works,"++ it works-- the battery holder is to small, you have to rasp a little bit, so the original canon battery will fit in.- size of the charger is to big ( for travelling )+ but cheap if you loss it in the hotel"
4,If u r into The G.D. then this book is definately recomended,"For anyone who is truly interested in The Golden Dawn this book should definately become part of your magickal library. The book itself is divided into nine parts, some of which are- astral projection, (two parts on)Rosicrucian, Christian occultism,Hermetic wisdomand mystical prayer, among others. You do need to be familiar with at least the basics of golden dawn philosophy before you can really grasp the majority of these writings. many of the collected works contained in this book were at one time closely guarded secrets of the Golden Dawn and some would probably not be available at all if not for this book. anyone who had something bad to say about this book probably either didn't understand it or didn't get what they expected. this is a good book and much of it is simply necessary reading for any serious golden dawn follower or ceremonial magickician. PEACE TO ALL BEINGS-AND FOREVER IN LOVE."
1,scratch marks on the fabric,"The whole set is for dry clean only, which was not mentioned. The worst part is that there are scratch marks on the comforter(it looks like someone had dragged it through some rough surface). The fabric is fuzzy along the track and I found wood chips at those areas. I am still hesitating if I should return the set, because the shipping fee is going to be about half of the price of the whole set. It is my second unpleasant experience with Amazon. I hope the quality of the products sold on the Amazon should be more carefully monitored in the future; otherwise, I will definitely think twice before I buy anything from here."
2,Too many camera cuts,"I love the Pixies. The band sounds great. And the audio isn't too bad like some people are saying, but I didn't hear the original version so I can't compare it.Worst thing about this video is the camera work. The director only stays on one camera for about a second, then cuts to another angle. This happens for the entire Video and it drives me CRAZY! I'd rather have one angle of a far shot of the entire band for the whole concert than these constant one second shots. The only break that your eyes get is in some of the extra's where a few of the songs have way better camera work, but not all of them.That's why I am giving it two stars. The performance is good. The Pixies are great! The film crew stinks."
1,German Workbook,"It looked like I was getting the 5th addition and I got the 4th instead, felt like I was mislead on product"
4,Aurally Engrossing,"First Michael Stearns Cd I've listened to. Found the CD overall dark,aurally adventuresome,powerful. Take time out to listen to it relaxed in a dark room. Very interesting! Will certainly take one on an aural journey."
5,THIS DVD IS WHAT YOU NEED!!!!!,"Finally, we get an INXS DVD!!!!! Now what we need is a compilation with every promotional video clip INXS made on one DVD, remastered in 5.1 surround sound just like this excellent concert reissue!!!!! Only flaw about this package is not including a remastered copy of the original LIVE BABY LIVE album, because both would have been perfect as a CD/DVD combo package, but it doesn't matter...this DVD gets 5 stars all the way!!!!!(This DVD also makes me wish that U2 would remix and reissue the ZOO TV: LIVE FROM SYDNEY and POPMART: LIVE FROM MEXICO CITY concert videos in 5.1 surround sound on DVD!!!!!)"
5,Great Skin Care Investment!,"After reading many favorable reviews via Amazon and other sites, I decided to give this product a try for my eczema which has gotten worse over the past year. I have been using a prescription medication but for some reason it just wasn't healing up the current eczema lesions or fading the previous lesions. Well, as a desperate last resort, I ordered this spray along with the Calendula ointment. I definitely recommend using the ointment first as it penetrates quickly, and keeps the skin moisturized for quite a while. The spray is good to use in between applications of the ointment and it also moisturizes the area thoroughly. Now after honestly using this for several weeks, I can say that almost all of the eczema outbreaks, new and old are almost completely faded and gone! I like the fact that a homeopathic remedy like this has many uses for the skin, is natural and beats a prescription medication. I am loving those Marigold flowers."
1,Bad,I lived in Hawaii when I ordered this and the spray molded over. I only used it once or twice on my son for his diaper rash. Get the ointment holds up way better!
1,Piece of Cr$5 - no customer service,"I have owned this set since June 11, 2002. It first broke on January 4, 2003 and was not repaired until February 10. Samsung admitted they had 'parts availability problems.' Then, on July 6, 2003, it failed again and as of August 6, 2003, remains dark with again, 'parts availability problems.' Samsung can not promise me ANY date it will be working, can promise no date for delivery of parts and generally does not follow-up or return telephone calls. I have hired a lawyer since after $1800 - they have very poor customer and warranty service - spend the $200 and buy a Mitsubishi."
4,IRS on Ice,"A full moon brings out the crazies, but an IRS auditor in the freezer of Conan Flag's favorite bar and restaurant is more than enough. This makes NOTHING CERTAIN BUT DEATH by M.K.Wren a chiller of a read.Brian Tally, owner of the Surf House Restaurant on the eve of better things is visited by an auditor from the IRS who states Brian has been understating his income and that the restaurant will be closed due to tax fraud. Brian claims he is innocent, but the next morning finds the auditor frozen to death in the kitchen's freezer.Conan investigates because he believes the local police and the IRS officials are hiding motives and evidence. An excellent start for a strong private investigator with a nose for the truth.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Car camping tent,"It's a run of the mill 6 person tent. Prices for Wenger tents are often very low and usually a good value. I took it out on a rainy camping weekend and the tent faired well. My biggest complaint is the weight. At 20 pounds this thing isn't designed to be carried around, even with the extra large duffle sized carrying bag which was included. The stakes included with the tent are weak and were eventually replaced. There is plenty of room inside for 6 people, but 4 would be a more comfortable number. If your looking for a cheap tent to accomodate 4-6 people this will do the job."
3,Not satisfied.,"Purchased this to replace a dying Polk Audio 12"" front firing subwoofer.At the volume levels I felt I needed to produce appreciable sound, this device was boomy and flat. It may have been the position in the room. (next to seating facing forward, away from listeners)Standing in front of it didn't help all that much.However I replaced it with the similarly priced Klipsch KSW 10 (shop around) downward firing subwoofer and was satisfied with this, even when compared with the old Polk.I think the position of the speaker and the materials in the room where you're listening are critical. It pays to buy from a retailer that allows easy returns. Thanks Amazon."
3,Nothing too new here.,"This book basically promotes a low glycemic load diet. If you google ""glycemic load"" you will find most everything you need to know about this diet. It would also be useful to google glycemic load studies. You will find that studies have proven that if you eat a low calorie diet of any type of food you will lose just as much weight as would on a low GL diet containing the same number of calories. I'm sorry folks but it comes down to calories in and calories out. If you lose weight on a low glycemic load diet it is likely because you are eating fewer calories because low GL foods provide more satiation.I believe the author is spot on about the health benefits of a low GL diet though. It likely does prevent many conditions such as diabetes and cancers."
3,Abracadabra,"Here we go again. Another magic solution to weight loss. What would starving societies think of Americans who spend their lives trying to lose weight, some to meet Hollywood standards others to have the pie and eat it? Even though the book has some interesting facts about the human metabolism, the solution to weight control remains the same: Get off the couch and excercise, eat moderately, and for goodness sake; read the ingredient labels of all manufactured food products.Andrew J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir"
5,Loved it,This books is easy to read and makes so much sense! I do not need to lose weight but want to eat healthier. Great information.Why are so many people so fat? Mark Hyman makes a great case for why.I took his advice and feel so much better.
2,A book about a book...,"While I don't necessarily disagree with the intended message of the book, the author spends roughly 75% of the words used to explain what the book is going to be about. Honestly, it's like going to watch a movie and repeatedly being shown trailers for the movie you thought you'd be watching.If you can happen to find a good summary review of the book, than you probably don't need to read the book."
3,"Recipes good, rest of book not so good","If you skipped directly to the recipes, you wouldn't be missing much. He wants you to eat whole foods, take some supplements, and throw in some activity here and there. Eliminate caffeine, white rice, flour, etc.I did like the recipes (too much reliance on soy products and fish, though), and he also gives you ideas for quick meals and some snacks, although he should have given guidelines for what to look for in a good snack bar, instead of just throwing out some brand names that would be unfamiliar to most people.And, btw, you have to provide an email before you can download the free stuff at the website.Check out of your library first--worth it to buy used for the recipes."
1,you have to be rich to eat this way!,"What a nice concept, to be able to buy all this food. I couldn't pay for the food listed even if it wasn't organic! Clearly written for those not working for a living."
4,Good for a bad movie,"A friend of mine saw this in the theater and said it was the worst movie he had ever seen. I can't really dispute that, some of the lines and plot points are incredibly stupid. If you aren't a scifi/horror fan, skip it. Nevertheless, for a bad movie, it has some great actors, nice special effects, scary moments. Haunted spaceship! I've watched it on cable a few times lately, there's something about it that hooks me. Go into it with low expectations, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
1,Great Movie but bad DVD,I was dissapointed in the DVD. I loved the movie but dont like the DVD. Image quality was not prestine but grany. Maybe to much detail in the effects etc. I would recommend renting it first to see if quality is up to the standards that you would like.
3,A Flawed Genre Piece,"While Event Horizon falls far short of greatness, it has some good special effects and does achieve a suitable creepy atmosphere. Ultimately, it's all sound and fury signifying nothing, but it does provide some good thrills along the way. The cast is much better than the material and one begins to suspect there may be some very interesting footage left on the cutting room floor. For now, this is all we have to go on. You could do much worse..."
1,Event Horizon = Space Dreck,"The premise is interesting although familiar, but story suffers from a confused spine and tons of plot holes. Also, some of the most ludicrous set design I've ever seen: The ship looks like a cross between an underlit 'Nostromo' from ""Alien"" and Disneyland's ""Haunted Mansion."" Not quite the design to keep a crew sane over years of space travel. The sets also offered pointlessly Gothic design (hallways that looked like abattoirs) inane set elements that were added just because they looked cool (headlights on a black hole generator?), all adding up to the set designer falling in love with his own sketches and the director letting him.Any crew spending any amount of time in that ship would have wigged out on their own, no Hell necessary."
4,Excellent comination of Sci-Fi and Horror,"This is the scariest movie I have ever seen. An evil that manifests as your darkest fears. We all have fears, something that scares us. The first half of the film is pure genius. It is mostly Sci-Fi about the vessels journey. There are some interesting ideas presented. The second half of the film is a wonderful horror film. Some of the visuals are amazing and Sam Neil is great. If you enjoy Sci-Fi this is a must see. Everytime I watch it, there is something new to look at."
3,Rent it,"ThinkThe Shiningset in space, with touches ofAlien (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)andHellraiser. That would be the film but not as good as any of them. The movie's concept is great and could have been a scary film but drops the ball. The movie was somewhat predictable and the cgi wasn't that great. If the space ships were cgi, then the cgi for the items floating around in the space ships weren't the greatest. The cinematography was excellent but again, the story falls short and almost close to boring. As it stands, the best horror movies out there are:Hellraiser,The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen),The Exorcist 3,The Thing (Collector's Edition),Saw - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition),Saw II - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)andSaw III (Unrated Widescreen Edition)."
1,Don not buy this movie,"This is one of the worst scifi movies I have ever seen. Overhyped, and the plot was well really non-existant. The movie had a chance to be a good one and they blew it by using everything that is able to scare people in the dumbest way. I could have been writen by anyone with a simple knowledge of science fiction and people. Thats to say anyone who has seen a scifi movie and is alive. Clasic example of how studio execs think now. Just think how many cancelled shows have been out lately. I don't even watch the pilots anymore."
5,Event Horizon,"Journey straight into hell in folded space and time with this epic SciFi horror. Step onto the ghost ship Event Horizon, where you are welcomed aboard but you can never leave even in death. Must see this one. There is gore and slasher violence. Probably 14 and above would be safe to watch this. Watch this in a nice dark room. The creepy factor is outstanding."
1,A poor imitation of Alien,"I don't know what people were thinking when they made this poor excuse for a movie. It's basically a member of the standard stranded-with-a-terrible-monster-on-the-loose horror movie genre, but with a plot and characters that don't make any sense at all. Throwing in a lot of gore and references to hell and the supernatural does not make a movie!I love science fiction and I enjoy a good horror film, but this is the only film I ever walked out of early at the theater."
1,Horrible movie,"The only movie worse than this is Cyborg. It's a pathetic story line, weak action, and horrible acting. It's two hours of my life, I'll never get back."
4,Surprising Horror and Sleep Loss,"Scarry, this is THE first movie I've seen in a LONG time that actually scarred me, yes an adult scared by a movie. I saw it late at nite, and that was a mistake, you will not sleep well. I like the recommendation of another reviewer ""watch a comedy after"" good idea. As for the science fiction aspect of the movie, I think that's why some were turned off, it had such EXQUISITE beutiful sets, very effective, but not as the adventure StarTrek/StarWars as usual stereotype the critics thought they were going to see. It turns out, for those of you who were smart and open-minded enough to stay to see the whole movie, that this movie is a cerebral thriller, it explores lightly but effectively, the gorry frightning aspect of madness and even the concept of ""hell"". ""Where were going you won't need eyes"", the latin touch added an extra chill. A tip for families, this movie is NOT for young kids."
4,Actual Specs,"Hey Gang,Here is an update on the Event Horizon Special Edition DVD. It is in a 2.35 aspect ratio. It includes at 5.1 Dolby Digital track as well as a DTS 6.0 track(Yeah!!!) The second disc includes outtakes, an storyboard version with director's commentary of an alternate beginning & ending. The outtakes are very interesting as well as Paul's commentary on what the film should have been. Hope this helps.."
2,Too many cheap shocks - not enough Sci-Fi,"The Amazon Editorial review sums it up nicely. B-horror movie feel, lots of cheap ""you know it's coming"" shock scenes, not enough sci-fi. Very predictible. Be sure to rent it before you buy it =)"
1,Horrible,"One of the worst sci-fi movies ever. Fails in every way. The pointless quasi-scientific exposition and senseless plot twists should clue one in early of the unsatisfying result of this film. Don't waste your time. For a similar type of movie with much better execution, try Danny Boyle's ""Sunshine,"" which is not great, but far better than this. Neither approaches the quality of ""Alien,"" which still sits at the top of the space-horror genre."
1,This is really a no star movie,"Event Horizon is the worst film I have ever seen. Period. But the really sad thing is that there was a kernel of a good film here. That kernel was the classic Russian movie Solaris. Solaris tells the same story with taste, intelligence, and restraint, all of which were missing in this blood and guts worthless film.Event Horizon is only of value to the seriously disturbed and one should be distrustful of any person who actually enjoyed it."
4,A remarkably effective frightfest,"The science fiction style under which this film was marketed was a delightfully misleading prelude to one of the scarier movies to come out in recent years. A number of factors contribute to the overall suspense of this movie: good acting and directing, an unseen and unknown assailant (no ""funny"" catch-phrase-killers) and intentional vaguaries surrounded the question ""Why?"" Rather than lessening the horrors by explaining them away , Event Horizon wisely avoids simplifying, and by doing so allow an element of mystique and imagination to further the menace of it all. This movie is definitely worth watching... alone... at night... in the dark."
1,"Blood, gore, and human entrails. You're kinda picture?","I found nothing redeeming about this movie. I got sucked in by a good trailer, and felt in need of a mental bath afterwards. I'm giving it one star for the special effects at the beginning."
4,Classic,Very under rated Sci-Fi film. Has a good mix of Sci-Fi and horror mix. Recommend to any fan of either genre.
1,Horrific and Bloody,The quite decent SciFi special effects are eclipsed by the gross and bloody horror scenes. This is the only movie in my collection of 600 titles that I intentionally physically destroyed. I would not want anyone I loved to watch this movie. Some of the scenes were so graphic in their gore that I think my brain was damaged! Stay away from this one.
3,Not as user friendly.,"This program offers lots of flexibility and options, but is much harder to use than some previous card programs we have had in the past."
2,A magazine article at best,A nice summary that should have been a 5-6 page magazine article.Not enough material to justify the price tag.
3,missing information,"for a 2006 edition this catalog is missing many many coins from previous years that one would expect to find. there are even missing items from before 2000! not very good for an edition that soppose to be 2006. in other cases, complete countries are missing like the new set from cocos islands with the 2004 set."
3,A bit unrealistic,"This would be a good book, but they are a bit realistic when they're talking about making times to study. Some of the activities are definately geared toward day people (I work nights), and definately people without small children. Good for students who are just entering college"
4,Young loud and snotty,"I was recently at a show at the Troubadour. I was there to see some band or other. I can't remember. But I remember that the first opening band was King Elementary. The place was packed with people to see the supporting band. They played when I got there. People left and it was very empty when the headliner played. I was thinking: who is this band? How can they be so popular? So now I have their CD and it sounds pretty good. It sounds generally like some new indie rock band, and if they played with Hot Hot Heat and Bloc Party I wouldn't think that would be so odd. King Elementary is pretty cool and apparently well connected."
2,not a compelling story,"This is a story about the success of SETI. That's a grand thing to imagine, but I don't feel that Gunn constructed a compelling human story around the technological one. The project grinds along for generations, so the narrative is told from the point of view of a succession of characters. I didn't feel that the characters had much that was interesting for them to do while the radio waves were crisscrossing interstellar space for decades.A secondary issue is that the book feels extremely dated. ""Girls bustled down the halls with coffee pots, and men stood near the water fountain, talking earnestly."" Quite a bit of the book deals with computers, and those parts are pretty laughable from today's perspective."
2,To many quotes not enough story.,"After seeing the reviews of this book I was really looking forward to it. In general I love the hard science fiction stories and prefer them overall. I had to struggle to finish this book and did not devour it like I do most novels I read. The reason for this and the reason I rate it so low are all the quotes in the book. You can't go a page without seeing some quote from another source. I really do like that stuff in my stories but my god every other thought in this story they go off and have to have some verse that has some deep inner meaning and importance. If I wanted to read Dante I would read Dante. If you took out all the extra quotes from other books and stories you would have a book half the size.Again I usually love little tidbits of thought in my stories but moderation is the key, here it goes way overboard to the point I feel like the story itself wasn't fully developed to the level it could have been."
4,50 Cent Actually used to be Very Good,"Since the dude signed with Eminem and Dr Dre his been releasing nothing but garbage, but before that he was pretty ill. I found it to be very good but I can only really give it 4 stars, why? 5 star rap albums are very rare, there are only a few of them. I didn't think 50 was that good but when a friend played some of this to me, I went and got it and now I listen to it nearly every day. If you like rap than I think there is a good chance you will like this."
2,yet another remake,"I don't question Hollywood for taking a beloved cheesy children's show and turning it into a modern remake. Remakes are all the rage these days. Unfortunately this one is way too serious for it's own good. Will I really find the answers to life's great mysteries in a serious version of a cheesy kid's show? LOL!It's all far more bleak and serious than the original, but that doesn't make it profound. Some kind of fun remake on the old show might have been entertaining. This serious take on it is often just dull. What does it mean to be alive? It means that life is too short for heavy handed nonsense like this!"
2,DOES NOT INCLUDE MINISERIES,"This low rating is not for the series itself, which is well done. I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewers as to the quality, writing, acting, etc of the show itself. However, this particular DVD set Does Not Include The Miniseries Even Though The Item Description Specifically States Otherwise. The first episode on disc one of this set starts after the miniseries. Do not buy this thinking you will get the entire BSG experience. Make sure you see the miniseries."
1,Boring melodrama,"Everyone on this show acts like a sulking adolescent. The show is second only to Oprah in its love of contrived ""issues"". My effeminate nerd son loves it but then he would."
5,Great show,Really got involved in this series - late to the party. Watched every episode and hungered for more. Great series. HIghly recommended for folks who like action mixed with some really good scripts.
5,Science fiction at it's best.,"I've really enjoyed watching this series of DVD's.Not only is it great science fiction, but the drama and human situations are excellently wrought into the series."
3,"""Arrogant Americans""?! September 11 plays a role!","I don't care for the comments against those who don't like the September 11 aspects of the series. September 11 does indeed play a role in this series. It's not arrogant to say so. It's not arrogant Americans claiming that it's true with no proof. There's no need to attack Americans as arrogant for saying it. *Ronald Moore made it clear that the first season was fueled by September 11, the War Against Terror, Iraq, and the Al Qaeda.* RON MOORE SHOULD KNOW!*I can see why some people are turned off. I prefer the direction this series is taking in it's second season with it's more mystical bent."
2,a pity,"David B. sums up the problem that many folks have: they once were able to suspend their disbelief and expand their imagination, but now they just can't get it up. Thus they prefer melodrama about dysfunction. Those who still enjoy fun and comedic escapism will find this less than satisfying."
5,amazing,"I held off on watching this show to see how many seasons they would get- I am tired of getting screwed like ""deadwood"" or ""dead like me"", etc. I grew up watching the original. This is so mature, so weel thought out and executed, the actors all excellent, I cannot fathom how the same hacks at sci-fi that did piranhaconda and sharktopus would be capable of something this good. Which explains why they no longer make it- it must have rankled their ""godzilla vs an octopus with aids and a shark head"" idiot mentality to produce high quality with great actors. The great casting and writing alone propel this to another level. Combined with great effects and apparently, carte blanche to make a great show not a hack show and you have one epic series. The depth in plot is there for those who care but it works anyway; it offers more to those who care to dig deeper. Olmos, of Miami Vice fame, may have shadowed that, and I say that as a huge fan of Vice."
5,one of the best Sci-Fi shows of the current era,"Season 1 is actually my favorite season of BSG, and that's saying a lot. It is one of the best written shows on television right now, the plot is gripping, and the chcracters are much grittier and more realistic than on many other utopian sci-fi shows. I have seen it dubbed ""The Sci-fi series for people who hate sci-fi"" by at least one critic.The show is not affraid to examine many contemporary issues in the guise of fiction, and it shies away from easy answers. Although there are villians and antagonists throughout, one of the most endearing features of the show is the way these roles can change and shift over time. There are certainly times when the viewer is not sure who is right and who they want to win. There are no classic heroes or villians, although characteristics of both are certainly present in abundance in some characters. It's this dystopian view that keeps the viewer engaged and enthralled, and always wanting more."
3,Boring Series,"delivered fast, but i am undecided wether or not to buy season 2, series is kind of slow.. the battle scenes are good.. looks sharp on blu-ray. But other than that the show does eem to be a bit slow and boring."
1,The absolute worse transfer ever!,"Let me say up front that the show itself is fantastic.The transfer to HD is the worst I have ever encountered.VHS would look better then this as it is so grainy I don't know how they get away with calling it HD, IT ISN'T!I only paid [...] for is and I am sure it is because the seller had a warehouse full of them and [...] bucks is better then nothing.The packaging is also the worse I ever seen.The only consolation is that it still cost less then the SD but I am sure the SD looks far superior to this piece of junk."
5,really enjoy the quality built into this series....Y,"You will repeatedly play the openeing theme song and crank up the true-blue sound.....great holiday show to play for visiting relatives or friends,get them hooked!!"
2,okay,"When I first learned of the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA mini-series I was very excited. What I don't like is how padded it is. The pace of the first part of the mini-series is tedious but the second part is better. I wish it were just two hours long. I began watching the weekly series and found it promising, but also slow and padded. Along the way I stopped watching the series on a regular basis. I'm all for character development, I love drama, and I understand that this isn't an action series. I only wish it weren't so lethargic. I can't see owning these DVDs for that reason. Tune in and catch the series on Sci Fi if you haven't seen it. Make up your own mind."
2,not my brand of sci fi,"""Reality"" TV is a fave with many people these days so I wasn't surprised by this ""realistic"" reworking of Battlestar Galactica. I was never a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica, but it was fun escapism. I'm more of a fan of original Trek, TNG, Star Gate, Farscape, and Firelfy. New Galactica is more of a sci fi series for those who don't like sci fi. It's more of a ""realistic"" drama. There will be no exploration of various different alien worlds and cultures. I don't find myself captivated by it. It's too much like the West Wing for me. You might want try a different purchase if you are the type of sci fi fan who doesn't like TV dramas like the West Wing."
2,save your money and watch this on TV,"Once I saw that this was not going to be a close remake of the original series it was my hope that it might be an original series that would keep my interest each week. It didn't. I agree with those who wanted to like it, couldn't, and lost complete interest."
2,Too small,"I couldn't fit very many of my milk bags in it. Also, please note they must be flat or this doesn't work well. I took another reviewer's suggestion and just use ziplocs, now."
1,Please people save your money,"I don't own this but I freeze my breastmilk in ice cube trays that look exactly like this and cost $1.49 at Target a piece. Please save your money and get an ice cube tray, it's the exact same thing!!"
5,Awesome product,This is the only product out there that helps to store the milk in a flat convenient way! It also helps keep you organized and able to use the oldest milk first. I would recommend this product to every breastfeeding mom.
1,Used lanisoh pads box instead!,"I was hesitant to buy this- took the tips of the other reviewers. I used the box that the lanisoh breast pads come in., they store about 15 lanisoh bags (frozen) perfectly! I just put the label portion on top and sort by date. I put the month outside w a sharpie!!! :)"
1,Save $20 and buy a Mainstay Ice Cube Bin from Walmart!!,The Ziploc brand breastmilk bags fit PERFECTLY (I MEAN PERFECTLY) in a Mainstay Ice Cube Bin available at Walmart for $1.88!!YOu can find it on the walmart website too!
3,Its okay,"I liked how it compacted the milk bags (you can store a lot then), but the container itself with the cover on top does take up quite a bit of room in the freezer (especially if you have a compact apartment type freezer)."
3,Nice Sweater - Runs Small,"This sweater is nicely made, and looks as displayed in photo, but it runs really small. I am always a ""Small"" and I needed to exchange my purchase for a Medium."
3,Disappointing,"I was somewhat disappointed because Mr Phipps was standing there singing. I expected something more entertaining. My mom has memory loss but loves the hymns so I play the Gaithers all the time for her. I thought this would be a little change, but it was not what I expected and she does not particularly care for it."
5,The best book ever!,"A few years ago my mom got me this book for my birthday, and I thought I'd try it out. It turned out to be the best book I have ever read, and I am not exagerating! I have read it every year since I got it, and I strongly suggest you read it, and realize what I'm talking about. The adventure and suspense is great, as well as the dialogue and strong characters you will want to meet. Take my word for it, once you pick it up, you'll never want to put it down!"
4,Damages Intrigues,The technical quality of the DVD set is top notch and makes watching this series enjoyable.
4,Great,My wife watched it with me and she loved it and laughed just as hard as when I watched for the first time years ago.
2,Nostalgia Only,"Having grown up in the Wood (which we never called it) it reminded me of first loves and innocence. I found myself more interested in the whereabouts of my once close friends rather than being truly involved in the story being told. Been there. Done that. Got the T-shirt and the hat. Not to diss what paid someone's bills, but The Wood was just a film. My memories are priceless, but the total running time of the flick is time i'll get never back. I'm not quite sure it was worth that."
3,meh.,"I run a NYC based art group, and I purchased this for us to watch, and follow along. I was quite displeased when we watched it, as it is basically a product placement DVD. The entire dvd is basically a commercial for other products, and nothing that she suggests, is really practical.Also, there is a lot of repetitiousness, and she goes into a lot of photo transfer stuff. Really, this dvd should have been titled differently, as it doesn't go into art journaling in a fast way as much as it does photo transfer."
3,Consumer Alert,"This appears to be a duplicate listing. The same cd appears to be available for much less elsewhere... if there is any difference, the seller should provide details."
4,Good Buy!,"This DVD served its purpose for an eight hour drive and kept our 3 yer old happy! At the end of the trip, it was annoying but as I saidit served its purpose to keep my toddler entertained."
1,recycled material,"I pre-ordered this item and looked forward to new Caillou cartoons. On the back of our previous Caillou videos, they all describe the product as a ""compilation of 4 new Caillou episodes."" However, this new version describes its contents as ""4 Caillou episodes."" That is because they recycle material from previous videos. There is some new content, but they shouldn't recycle any old material. I do not recommend purchasing this video."
4,great performance,"Exactly what I was looking for, for movies and stereo music, is just a great sound, for all the JBL speakers system bought from Amazon."
5,THE DANGEROUS TRAIL,Clay Allison a dangerous outlaw puts together a few good men and rustle a herd thru the dangerous trail from Mexico on into Colorado. Thru the Alamosa Trail there are desperate crooks and bad cowboys. Allison's boys get mixed up with a group of slave selling bandits. and in order to survive they must use their guns. Robert Vaughan is a tremendous author. Every page is exciting!
4,Great,"I'd love to have given this map 5 stars, especially for the price but whomever rolled mine up wasn't that careful and there will always be some kinks. Other than that, it's great."
5,are you The Love Generation?,"This is one of the best songs i knew in Europe!with a positive message to the new generations, a happy song with a good message. Bob Sinclair rules!"
3,i love this novela but..,"I was kind of disappointed on how its all edited and a lot of good scenes are missing. Id be happy to pay more for the full version of it. Like I said, I love this novela and I would very much appreciate it if you got the full version :( please please please. Im sure your other customers what this too."
4,Bert the Muppet Puppet,"I was worried based on some reviews I saw that this puppet would be too small to fit a man's hand. I'm a man and wear a size 9.5 glove and I can fit my hand in it OK, although it's a bit snug. My granddaughter loves it."
3,Bert Hand Puppet,Purchased as a gift. I cannot submit this review without stars so I picked a middle rating - please ignore these. Seller provided product on time in new packaging. No issues with product.
3,"Forgetable Story, Still a Good Series","I'm still an Anna P fan, but I can whole heartedly say I don't remember much about this book. I listened to it about a week and a half ago, and my memories of the plot are fragmented and dull. The names stuck out certainly, but not much else. The wrap-up seemed so laid out. It's like the author used her synopsis as the last ch/ epilogue... this happens, then this happens, then this happens sort of feel to the end.If this is your first Anna P book, pick up another, they're good ones out there. Endangered Species and Deep South are both nice entries."
2,FRUSTRATION,"This was the MOST frustrating Anna Pigeon book I've ever read.Anna was so incompetent I could have screamed at her over and over, had she been in my living room.To let Randy Thigpen (among very many others) get away with such insubordination and ineptitude, did not a great boss make!!And let's not even talk about the deer meat in the trunk!This book was a DRUDGE to work through..."
4,Good Basic Italian Grammar Book,"This is a very straight forward basic review of Italian grammar, useful for those who want to cross reference something they heard or wish to say in Italian."
4,A good starter grammar,"This book will provide you with a good overview of Italian Grammar, but for the serious student interested in attaining fluency it just isn't detailed enough. Many grammatical topics are entirely omitted, topics of extreme importance if you are interested in using the language for more than traveling. If you are looking to be able to communicate on a trip to Italy, this plus Rosetta Stone or Drive Time Italian should work, but if you are really interested in learning Italian this will not take you far enough."
5,I was in baumholder at this time,"This book was amazing, I was there in Baumholder Germany while this book was happening. It brought back so many memories. It made me go back and reminise. As an Army wife of a soldier this book is 100% true. I am glad that Redmond made this book for others to read. To let the public know what we as wives went thur. I had friends whose marriage didnt make it thru that deployment, I have one friend who is still my friend whose husband didnt come home and lost his life in iraq. And of corse I have me, a survior of a marriage and that deployment. Bravo to the ladies of these stories... I read it and hugged my husband. It made me appreciate what I have in him."
3,Rainsford Chan: A Man of Myth,"I think that this book is an extremely introspective piece about a young Chinese American boy who is discovering the balance between the Chinese heritage he has denied his entire life, as well as the American that he could never be. Wong's poetic nature surfaces in this prose through his lilting descriptions that disclose the connection Rainsford seeks to find between his heritage and this country who was so unaccepting of Chinese immigrants, and how possibly the nature of society has never really changed no matter how hard he tries just as his ancestors did."
5,Excellent AZ Rock,"This is very good for everyone that loves AZ rock. Listen to 2min of each track at [...]if you're curious. For fans of No Knife, JEW, Midtown, Promise Ring, etc."
4,Beuatifully Written,This the best book I've found on ADO. It is well written and beatifully organised. The key chapters for me were 4. Getting Connected 5. ADO Command Strategies 6. Recordset Strategies 7. Manipulating Your Recordset. There is also a great chapter on ASP as well as a chapter on moving data efficiently between tiers which are not my main focus. I didn't give it 5 stars because already it's a little dated. Nothing really on ADO 2.6 or SQL Server 2000. But it sholdn't be a handicap.Also not much on esoteric command strategies such as creating Stored procedures on the fly where your parameter is in the Select or From clause.
3,An Active Read,"I title Christopher Unborn, an active read because unlike other books where you may just get away with reading the bare minimum, Chirstopher Unborn requires your full attention. Carlos Fuentes' prose forces you to not only pay attention at the contextual level to what is going on within the story but also to pay close attention to the physical aspect of what is going on in the page since the words themselves are shifting off the page in a unconventional manner. The story itself, interestingly enough adopts a unborn narrator speaking from the womb of his mother, explicating on the political and social upheavals of Mexico. Fuentes' witticisms are fun and entertaining but once again are only noticeable with a determined reader and watchful eye. If you are not willing to take the challenge, it may seem confusing and convoluted, but to those that are, it will be rather enjoyable."
3,Odyssey handbook and guide to writing,"The Odyssey Handbook is a primer for grammer, punctuation, understanding sentence structure, and construction of compositions. It is suitable for a high school or college student or someone who wishes to educate themselves in the fundamentals and the vocabulary of grammer. (do you know what a predicate is, or a non-restrictive clause?)The book is not, as another site led me to believe, a book for assisting serious writers with clarifying their thoughts and writing more creatively."
3,I felt bored.,"Just got this 3d blu ray but I felt bored. Don't waste your money. I also got UNDER THE SEA 3D, I just loved, one the best 3d experience."
2,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.Other than a few sardines breaching the surface of the screen, out of screen effects are found at 28 , 35 , 36 , 37 & 38 minutes. IMAX style flythroughs and 'above the water' beautiful scenery make up about 50% of the film. Below the 3D is somewhat muted except for a few minutes of the `great hunt' under water footage.Many scenes with parallax problems.*** TAKE A PASS ON THIS MOVIE AND GO FOR `DEEP SEA' ***MY 3D RATING = FAIR (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
2,TF Music,"If you're a fan of the Japanese TF series and can understand Japanese then I think you will like this. If you're a fan of the 80s American TF series like me then you will not like this. It does have some catchy theme music and some of it I recognized from when I would watch TF in Korea on the Armed Forces Network. Don't get me wrong, its not bad you just have to like this particularly style."
2,Modern novel wannabe,"Sometimes where there's a will there isn't necessarily a way. Floyd Dell was among the first wave of post-WW I writers who were disillusioned by the war, but hadn't developed a style yet (a la Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, Dos Passos, and others) to express that disillusionment. Thus while striving to be new (modern), Dell is stuck in the old. This novel, a sequel to ""Moon Calf,"" is about restlessness: a marriage flounders and characters complain about life being too easy and meaningless. The world to them is a ""pasteboard world."" This is a modern sentiment, but Dell can't make the transition into modernism to express it: his style and approach are still old-fashioned, closer to Edith Wharton, say, than to Hemingway. This odd mixture of modern concerns with old-fashioned method causes the novel to be a disappointment."
3,A little chip,"I purchased the Pfaltzgraff Evening Sun 2-Piece Chip and Dip Set, it's what i expected except the ""dip"" dish has a small chip on the edge.Too bad"
