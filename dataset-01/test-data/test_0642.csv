1,not worth it,"Very disappointed in the results I got from this product. I can't hardly see a difference from my before & after pictures. It may have lightened the stains on my teeth, but not noticeably. It certainly did not make them white. I tried very carefully to keep the gel off of my gums, but it still made them painfully swollen and red and they bleed a bit.I'm just going to have to shell out the big bucks and whiten my teeth at the dentist office.On a positive note, the teeth trays were easy to mold.Maybe my expectations were too high, but I will not be purchasing this product again, as it doesn't appear to have whitened or lightened the color of my teeth at all."
2,Not Impressed,I was very unhappy with the results of this product. I took pictures after every 20 minutes whitening session and I saw a very small difference. I won't ever purchase this product again.
1,Pain without resuts,"I got this kit because the price was reasonable and I was attracted by the quick results. When I was applying the whitening gel I did not experience any pain or discomfort. My last application was at 1:00 p.m. However, by the time I tried to fall asleep I was in such incredible pain that I did not sleep at all last night. My teeth and gums have been throbbing and I have a terrible headache as a result. I have never had such a problem with other whitening strip brands or other Rembrandt products. Not only am I in significant pain, but I have absolutely no results. My teeth are just as white as before. Stay away from this product! I used the 5 day Rembrandt whitening trays in the past, which gave me impressive results. They should discontinue the 2 hour kit. I followed all of the warnings on the package regarding sensitivity, to no avail."
4,Happy with results,"My teeth definitely do look whiter. I want to do it again though.Yes, there is pain involved, but it's not unbearable, and not any worse than with Britesmile or other bleaching agents. I have to say that I'm happier with the results of Rembrandt than any other at home whitener I've used. I didn't use the tray they provided though. I used custom trays that I had specially ordered online, and that may make a difference."
1,Not for me,"I was convinced by the positive feedback that this product would indeed work for me. It's quite easy to use. Instructions are easy to follow. However, when I used it, I had to stop and take the mouthpieces out of my mouth because 3 of my teeth were in pain like being stabbed in the nerves. After the pain subsided, I continued the process. Although I had to keep stopping due to the pain, I seen a very minimal improvement. The sensitivity in my 3 teeth lasted 2 days. Not satisfied with this product at all."
1,No noticeable results - no money back,Allowed my 14 year old daughter to purchase this system and helped her use it properly following all the instructions. Did all the whitening steps back-to-back in one day for most dramatic results. We took pictures after each 20-minute session and saw no visible results at the end. We then proceeded to take advantage of the money-back guarantee sending in filled out form and original receipt - nearly $40 of her own money. That was over 6 months ago and still no response. Rated this product 1 star because zero stars was not allowed.
2,Painful!,"My bottom gums blistered so badly that I stopped using the product after the first 20 minutes. I tried again yesterday on my top teeth only, and apart from making my gums white and sore, I did notice a little whitening. Today I used it again on my top teeth and now I have ugly white spots on my teeth, (which I hope will go away!). I'm sticking to Crest."
2,some non-rhymes are suspect,"A fellow reviewer suggests that the rhymes are suspect for the Brits, but fine for Americans. What American doesn't rhyme ""north"" and ""forth?"" But this dictionary says they are non-rhymes. Get the Merriam-Webster version."
4,British buyers beware!,"Finding rhymes by phonetics is something you will appreciate in time, and it really isn't all that hard, even for foreigners like myself. The book is large, well-structured, and has a lot of what we are all looking for: Rhymes. Unfortunately, the rhymes are US English rhymes, which for the UK English speaker (and some Canadians) means:1. Wrong phonetics for some words. Try as you might with your British ear, ""fire"" is not where it's supposed to be.2. Some words are listed as rhymes that simply don't rhyme in UK English.3. Some UK English rhymes are listed as non-rhymes, like ""forge"" and ""gorge"".But this is of course a problem with all US made rhyming dictionaries. If you are a US buyer, there is no reason for you not to buy the book."
1,"Does ""shine"" rhyme with ""caffeine""?","Here it is in a nutshell: if, for your purposes, ""fidgety,"" ""fiery"" and ""flattery"" rhyme well enough, or ""vine"" with ""wolverine,"" then this is the book for you. (I even found ""pleasure"" rhymed with ""around,"" but let's assume that was a mistake.) On the other hand, if your work demands perfect rhyme, then wading through all these off-rhymes in search of a true one will be frustrating and annoying. I write books for children, and most kids want their rhymes perfect. The earlier version of Clement Wood, which seems to be out of print, was much, much better for careful rhymers. This edition, as revised by Ronald Bogus, should be titled The Complete Near-Rhyming Dictionary. Suitable for some purposes perhaps, but for the rest of us-- yikes!"
4,Great rhyming dictionary but unless one is writing Shakespeare ...,... probably too much to sift just to find a few single syllable rhymes. Better to search online and narrow it down a little first.Lots of work gone into a book like this. Lots of work!
4,Something all americans should know,"Killing Pablo, Book and Viedo show the truth behind the most dangerous criminal ever. The weakness of the Colombian goverment and military institutions that during the early 90's surrendered to the lord of drugs, Pablo Escobar, in an easy, hypocritical, and profitable way that the common people in Colombia had to pay with their own innocent blod. This is a very important historical document that shows the Americans why the United States gets involved in this kind of overseas conflicts, how this problem not just affected a huge portion of the American society but also it's national economy. After your see this video or read the book you will understand that there are good people in Colombia; not every Colombian is a drug dealer or a rebel."
2,Not Worth a Penny,"I bought this book to get a better understanding of the systems on my '80 RX-7. While reading, I've spent 75% of the time trying to weed through the text trying to locate the portions that applied to my vehicle. My advice would be to buy the Haynes manual which covers the specific vehicle, as this hodge-podge is very difficult to follow.Illustrations were sparse, and the ones that are there are marginal at best. The printing company that was contracted for this job must have been the lowest bidder.I also own a Suzuki Samurai, and the Factory Service Manual for it. I reccommend the factory books where available. Unfortunately, it's not available for the RX-7s. This is NOT EVEN CLOSE to the quality of a good factory manual.One man's opinion."
1,"If you have a 929, don't even bother","This book covers maybe how much oil and other fluid to put in your 929, but don't believe it. It does has more on the RX-7 and 626, but not worth it if you are working on a 929."
3,Some nights I have trouble falling asleep so ...,Some nights I have trouble falling asleep so I thought Melatonin would be a good product for me. The first night I fell asleep after about 1/2 hour. The next night it took me longer to fall asleep. I liked the fact that this is natural and not habit forming. I wish it were in a safety-sealed container. I have children in the house and I prefer everything to come in hard-to-open packages.
3,Case is a little bulkier than I expected but fits the shaver I needed it for,The case came in a very old looking box but looks like it does in the picture. It will serve the purpose I need it for but seems to be unnecessarily bulky.
2,Very shallow,"Books on value investing, as I observed, have two apporaches: Quantitative & Qualitative.Quali: The Intelligent Investor & The little book on value investing.Quant: Value investing from graham to buffett, John Neff on Investing.This book is qualitative and very shallow. Good for people who have no idea of value investing.The book, I speculate, is more like a brochure/prospectus of their mutual fund.Although there is no ""magin formula"", I had read many value investing books that illustrate somewhat concrete and detailed approach to analyzing fin statements and ratios. This is book way way too shallow."
5,Pretty Good.,"I am a teacher and I bought this drive to use to take files back and forth between my home computer and the three classrooms that I teach in. The biggest problem that I have with it is due to it's physical size. I have to move all of the computers that I plug it in so that I can plug it in a USB port on the back. It doesn't fit in many ports on the front because of it's fat body.Otherwise I have had very few problems with this drive. I lost all of the information contained one it one time, but as with any type of media, you always want to have your data backed up in at least two places, so I was able to recover it and only lost 6 or 7 files.On the super plus side, I accidently left it in my pants pocket one day and my wife washed the pants before I could find it. Well, surprised to say... it is still working over 2 months later!!! So it's a very hardy little drive."
2,Fine Charger-Took FOREVER to come,"The product is fine, but when my charger breaks I don't want to wait 2 weeks for a new one...Which I had to."
1,Doesn't fit VX8300,Does not fit a Verizon VX 8300. Don't waste your time and money. Junk. Very disappointed with both products. Order elsewhere
1,Doesn't Fit VX8300,Bought this to use with a VX8300 and it doesn't fit that phone! Useless! Fortunately we found another charger that fits without an issue.
5,It was a great motivational book!,This was a great motivational book to help put you issues in order. Pat Riley teaches us the art of teamwork to have success!
5,Pat Riley has taken his coaching skills to us all,"Whether you are head of a big company, managing a classroom of children, taking care of a family or just you and your job, Pat Rily has put together a great life and business management tool, The Winner Within. I highly recommend it.Boot Camp Fitness for All Shapes and Sizes: Complete Manual to Exceed Your GoalsWeight Loss: Twenty Pounds in Ten Weeks, Move It to Lose ItFood & Fitness JournalColonel Bob's Six Keys to Permanent Weight Loss, NEW RELEASEBOOT CAMP FITNESS FOR ALL SHAPES AND SIZES: Complete Manual to Exceed Your Goals (The Health Colonel Series)Weight Loss - Twenty Pounds in Ten Weeks - Move It to Lose It (The Health Colonel Series)Quotes to live by (The Health Colonel Series)The Tale of the Little DucklingLollopy Goes OlympicColonel Bob's Eight Secrets to Longevity, Health and Fitness, NEW RELEASE"
4,The winner is you!,"The Winner Within actually gets 4.5 stars from me. If you like team sports, not even basketball, this book will get to you. When you're in business and are strongly dependent on good teamwork, his lessons can be transformed to business life.Riley's success is known throughout the US. Being European and less familiar with the person itself it gives me good fundamentals for judging without strings attached. I think his methods work. His methods work, but they may not last or can be implemented in any situation. You have to take the best 60% of his method and mix it with your own beliefs and culture. This last 40% will be your adaptability withing your own situation.I have learned a great deal reading this book, as I was soon to become a business owner with a team of programmers. Riley's methods definitly helped me in creating my own team and, as important, my own style.Read it, absorb it, use it. Do not copy it."
1,Just close the book and forget it....,"After reading some of the reviews on this site, I'm glad to see I'm not alone. I read the 1st chapter at the bookstore and bought it thinking I was in for an enjoyable read. HOW WRONG I WAS...I suffered through each and every chapter. Both the main characters were annoying and by the end, I was wishing they hadn't survived the plane crash...You're probably wondering why I kept reading-unfortunately once I start a book, I have to finish it-it's a compulsion. Skip this book and buy the WONDERFUL ""Watermelon"" by Marian Keyes."
1,Ugh!,"I can't believe I allowed myself to read this book. Valerie Brock has proven that unlikeable fictional characters don't make a pleasant read. Please, don't waste your money on this. There are so many other novels that are well written and enjoyable."
2,Crash,"""Was It Something I Said"" has the most unlikable characters I have ever come across in a book. I actually wish that the characters had crashed and died in the 2nd chapter - I would've read it in the book store, therefore saving me 24 bucks. Sincerely."
3,Wrong description,"Described as ""full-faced"" wheras i received ""standard"" cd labels. See technicak details: ""Package includes 100 full-faced CD labels and 200 jewel case spine labels"". But they are not full-faced. I am returning them."
2,good but..,It is good but I have some problems in using it. It continues making noise when I use the USB to get electrical power. But it works very well when I use batteries
3,Very nice . . only problem is they fog up,"I thought these safety glasses were fog up resistant but they are not. They fit nicely though, do not slip"
3,meh did what they were intended to do,They were good and comfortable and stuff yeah. I wore them all the time when i was out side working.
4,Very Good Advice,My husband is a Senior Tax Auditor and has done freelance financial consulting. He found the book to be very helpful.I find it helpful and understandable to the lay person.
1,What good is selling a work book you can't work in?,I was really exited to have this series. The book is great and I wanted to work through the work book while I read the book. I figured it would have a way to fill out items or perhaps let you print excersises from the book. It has neither option so it was a waste of money getting an electronic copy.
3,"I ordered the book too, I should have just gotten one","The information in the workbook is great. It really is parallel to the book by Dave Ramsey. I got both, but only one is really necessary if your wallet calls for it. The workbook is great for people who need to write things down or see more numbers. The book has more stories. I'm really enjoying it. I've got a lot of work to do on my finances!"
5,Throughtly enjoyed watching.,My daughter is looking to see if there was a 3rd season as the marriage of Jeremy and Candy did not accure on season 2.
5,"Hot characters, stories and music!",The characters are great. The stories are hot! The music is just wonderful. I watch episodes over and over. Cannot get enough of it!!!
4,Dated dirty jokes that still have appear,"This collection of dirty jokes from the 1950's contains many textual classics that reappear from time to time in other venues as well as some that are visual. Given their time of printing, the language is of course not coarse, but generally tame enough to appear in a modern ""G"" movie. Lacking even the mildest of ""dirty"" words, the humor of these jokes is generally based on wordplay, imagination and the double entendre.In the modern world of adult humor that seems to require the vibrant use of hard swearing (mother is just half a word) these jokes take you back to a ""simpler"" time where the understanding of a dirty joke required thought and the development of an incongruous mental image."
2,dissapointed,"Bought this product to hold up a normal size calender, it took both magnets to hold the calender up. Not as powerful as some reviewers described"
5,Master Magnetics #07506 2PK Large Blue Magnet Clip,"good quality, strong magnets. I've had these for a few weeks and they are holding up well with regular use. I've had 15-20 coupons hanging on my fridge and its not had any issue."
1,Why bother covering up you can see thru it...,"The tarp seems to be made well, alittle out of square, BUT if your buying this to cover something up and hide it, this is not the tarp you want you can see thru it........."
1,AVOID THIS ALBUM AND THIS SHOW,"After seeing this show and listening to the recording, I can firmly say that Broadway is at it's lowest in years. The show was terrible, consisting of a hollow plot, hollow music and hollow script. As an actor I felt bad for the cast who had to perform such trite and empty material. I want my money back from the show and the CD. The music is dull and un-memorable and some of the actors have great voices on other recordings, but not here. The sooner this show leaves, the better."
5,since i can't see the show every night...,"...now I can listen to the CD and relive it whenever I want! The show was spectacular (I saw it twice in 4 days) and the CD brings it all back. The CD does have that studio recording sound, but it does capture the feelings of the live Broadway show. I appreciate that the words are included and enjoy the photos of the cast. Patrick Wilson has a wonderful voice, as does the rest of the cast. I especially enjoy Let It Go, Breeze on the River, and Man. Also, hearing Kathleen Freeman sing is bittersweet. If you enjoyed the show, the CD is definitely worth buying."
4,Hand Painted Parasol: Beautifully Delicate,"I bought this and one other parasol with the intention of using it as props during photo shoots. It is VERY beautiful but also very delicate. The parasol seems to be handmade and hand-painted. The parasol is made of thin material sewn with green string in and around the wooden frame. The parasol can close pretty well and comes with a nice ""sheath"" to put it in (unfortunately, I have misplaced mine). When opening the parasol all the way to the ""clicking point"", it does feel as if it's about to reach its limit. Push it all the way though, it's supposed to go that far (almost to a complete right angle with the top portion and the handle.Conclusion: Though delicate, I have not had any problems with the parasol. As long as they are treated as they are fragile, you should have no problem either. The parasol is beautiful and looks completely hand made and hand painted, adding to the attraction of it. A purchase I would gladly repeat!"
1,Joint and Muscle Pain Relief,I didn't get much of a result. I bought it because the anti-snoring spray worked so well.
1,Boring,The pictures take too much time and they are really boring. I took them to the garbage can because they are not worth the time to resee them in the future. I feel very disappointed with Zero de Conduite because I think it does not have any argument.
3,"Nice, but...","I have purchased a Zune 80GB and I was looking forward for the remote controller included in this package. But I got upset when while trying to make it work, it didn't. Now I know it is because of a compatibility issue.Amazon and Microsoft (especially Microsoft) must be more careful to offer products and accessories with full compatibility among them.Apart of that the case is nice, that is why I rated it with three stars.Al other stuffs included work fine."
4,Worth It,"This is a great bargain. I was skeptical about the price and value of this product, but after the package arrived- my doubts vanished. All parts were included and the parts are working great. One caution, the sales invoice didn't include a telephone number or instructions how to return the product if defected."
4,Dark...,"This is a dark, dark album full of native rhythms and chanting and even insect sounds to create a Catholic nightscape. Lots of guilt (""Only Talking Sense""), lust (""Angels Heap""), and angst (""Where is My Soul""). And the melodies, well, they're just haunting. Period."
3,A bit sparse,"Not the production, mind you! It's wonderfully raw and un-produced which gives it a sort of edgy feel. There are a few good songs on here but nothing up to par with any of the Crowded House albums. ""Last Day Of June"" and ""Angel's Heap"" are my fav's."
4,Tangled Webs,I live across the street from this author . . I primarily enjoyed it; however (imho) it was too long - she could have produced two books from all of this and the main character suffered too many grievous(sp) acts! But it held my interest and enjoyed most of it.
5,Simply Elegant,"This thoughtful score is a brilliant match to Mamet's small town setting. It is simple and appropriate...and each track evokes the scene it was written for beautifully. The last track, the one that goes over the end credits, is lots of fun."
1,It Brakes,"I purchased two of these machines at the same time, they work good in the beginning but give it a little time and you will find them to brake easy. Where the back part folds down to snap in they have little plastic tabs. My first one, broke on the right side and my second one just broke on the other side. What happpens is your recieving faxes will not come through because it needs to seat correctly. Plus the film is expensive. I've called panasonic and basically to get fixed you might as well buy another one or just toss it. I took a hammer to my first one..Litteraly and I'm ready to do it again with the second one. They are cheaply built. I vow to never again own a panasonic fax machine! I spent 200 bucks a piece for these. Simple Junk."
2,Not reliable,"When I purchased this machine, it had a six month warranty. Seven months later a small latch inside broke. I have had to tape the cover down just to be able to use it. Works but not well. I will try another brand next time."
3,Eh..,"I bought this album after hearing Orbit's genius in his Pieces in a Modern Style album, his incredibly brilliant work with Madonna, and the other production he did with other artists (U2, Melanie C, All Saints). This album, however, is not nearly as sonically unique as I thought. Tracks 2 and 3 stand out as great songs, but the rest is just okay. It's not a bad album by any means, just nothing special."
4,Adequate,"I wish they were a bit longer, but they seem to hold my hair in place. Too bad you can't buy these in a drug store as you used to years ago. You can only buy hair bands and pony tail holders. bummer!"
3,Work like typical hair combs,"These are standard-sized hair combs and work like typical hair combs. The plastic is stiffer than the combs I've bought in the past so I don't expect these to last as long. I've bought combs like this before and the teeth of the stiffer plastic tend to break more easily than the more pliable plastic like goody brand uses. I was actually looking for the longer combs that goody used to make, but I haven't been able to find for about years."
4,Great but expensive here,This spread is just right but costs only about six dollars locally.price with shipping here is ridiculous!
3,Good mellow music,"This album good--perfect rainy day music. It is hard to characterize this EP because each song sounds so different--all tracks are fairly soft and quiet, but they each have their own style because every member wrote, produced, and performed all the instruments on one song. Track one, ""Funny Little New Wave Kid,"" has keyboards and a slow beat, and reminds me of Her Space Holiday. Tracks two and three are simple, sad, and pretty depressing songs, but they are good. Track four, ""Your Shapeless Head,"" has quirky lyrics but it drags on...kind of boring. Track five, ""The Ford Chevy Debate,"" is a little more upbeat and fun, and it has a funny ending. I would guess that if you like Simon Joyner, Molasses, or Songs: Ohia you will probably like Monroe Mustang."
2,Well Intended but Painful,"If you like to read every last detail of how to perform a task, this is the book for you. She really was complete.Unfortunately I don't have that kind of time. I learned iMovie in half a day with the Missing Manual book.I expected 10 hours with this book and I would be off to the races but with all the detail in the chapters, and we don't start talking about importing from DV until chapter 12? Yikes! I know this product isn't that difficult to use."
3,useful,"Its useful but not 100% unbendable/unbreakable though like I expected, you still have to be careful."
3,Great for awareness,"This book is great about making people aware of the issue but it offers little help in over coming the issue. My brother was dealing with these issues and in his words he said, ""The books tells you you are drowning then describes the color of the water for you"". But it helped get the family aware of the issues, and how we tend to exasperate them. Taking meditation classes helped him a lot. I guess fixing the issue is a whole other book."
2,My husband never finished it. . .,Obviously not good enough to catch an ADD reader's attention! Maybe if it was a picture book. . .
4,Good complement to the ADD & ADHD Diet,"I read the ADD and ADHD Diet first and found that reading Driven to Distraction was a good complementary title. With both books, I had all the information I needed to cope with my personal situation."
3,Driven to Distraction,A well written book which listed case studies but did not fulfill my expectation with assistance for solutions to this problem of ADHA.
5,A fresh take on Hitchcock,"In almost stupefying detail DeRosa describes how Hitchcock and screenwriter Hayes conceived, wrote, and produced four of Hitchcock's better films, including Rear Window and To Catch a Thief. Along the way DeRosa tells how Hayes' reputation grew to the point that Hitchcock was no longer comfortable maintaining the relationship. Engagingly written, this is a fresh take on Hitchcock which I thoroughly enjoyed, especially after seeing three of the four on the newly released DVD's."
5,The little girl I gave this to loved it,I gave this tea set to my friend's daughter for her birthday. She loved it. It looks beautiful and comes in an attractive carrying case. It was fairly inexpensive as well.The seven-year-old girl I gave this to has told me she has held multiple tea parties with this set and her parents confirm that the tea set works great. I can't go over to their house without her pulling out the tea set for a party.
1,Junk and should not be sold.,"I have had good experiences with past purchases of Super Pet products. This Super Pet Hamster Silent Spinner being the exception. I think it may have lasted a week and a half before it started making noise. I tightened the yellow knob in the center thinking that would fix it, and it did for a day or two. Then the noise became worse and the wheel was wobbling when my hamster would run in it. The bearing seemed to have a flat spot that did not allow the wheel to turn smoothly. I am still using the wheel part however and with considerable modification it now works very well. I would not purchase this wheel. This wheel is a perfect example of planned obsolescence. Companies should not be allowed to make something that can't even last two weeks."
1,Super Pet products are trash,"We have two gerbils and have had them for several years. I too, had purchased the Silent Spinner. It broke within the hour that we got it home. I have never seen a more inferior line of pet care products. I do not understand how this company can get away with selling this junk. Every single thing that I have bought by Super Pet has broken at one time or another. It seems that everything that I have has either been taped or glued together. It thoroughly disgusts me because you are over a barrel when you go to Petsmart or Petco, that is what they sell. It is as if you have no choice but to spend good money on something so poorly made."
1,"Great Idea, poorly built","I purchased the 4.5"" silent spinner for my dwarf hamsters. I have 2 of them so I assume that the spinner gets double duty. Six days (6 Days) after purchase, the axle appears be be broken. It spins off balance and now make a clunky noise every rotation. I am really disappointed with this product. I really do think that the design is good but the construction or possibly the parts used to build it are of poor quality."
4,Great Wheel,"I own this wheel for my hamster and I have to say it's the best I've owned ever. It IS silent. But here are some tips to get the best use out of it.1. Make sure the wheel's stand is on top of a layer of bedding on a flat level surface2. After some time, the wheel will begin to rattle a little. This is because of the loosening between the colored and white part. To fix this, just put tape along that crack all around the wheel (make sure it's tight!)3. Setting the wheel at a diagonal angle against a corner is sufficient for not letting the wheel move and the sides hitting the side of the cage."
4,"Not silent, but darn quiet...","I've searched high and low for a ""silent"" hamster wheel and this is by far the best I've found. No squeaks, no annoying rattling noises, just a slight bit of vibration that could easily pass for ""white noise"". Overall a good product and worth the price."
3,Ok for mice and dwarf hamsters,"My problem is the recommendation that this is for hamsters. It's fine for mice and dwarf hamsters but once a Syrian hamster or gerbil reaches adulthood, the wheels is too small. I recommend getting the Giant Silent Spinner for those animals. It is more expensive, but so is buying two wheels. :D Unlike the Giant Silent Spinner, this one either requires you to have a barred cage or to zip tie the stand to the cage, the Giant one actually screws to a mesh cage (1"" x 1/2"" wire). I wish they'd make the smaller wheels like that."
3,SIZE,"The problem with these Silent Spinner wheels is that they only have sizes 41/2,61/2,and size 12............My Degus Silent Spinner is too big for them......I need a wheel that's in between and can still screw onto the cage......And,the 6 1/2 size wheel is too small and doesn't screw on the wired cage.........."
3,living fireplace,fireplace scenes were pleasing.scene selection was difficult; the normal program link did not work.
1,No Meat on These Bones,"If you think you are getting the entire mini-series think again. This is not even a shadow of the real thing. I would rate it zero stars if such an option were available. Not only is most of the original hacked out, but this tape majored on the minors such as Christie Allie's affair with the priest.As a Mafia buff, I thought the original was the best mini-series I have ever seen. I hope some network brings it back in its entirety so I can film it on the old VCR."
4,Crash into Headcrash head on !!,"Headcrash is a good listen, if your into groups like Linkin Park, Papa Roach, Lost Prophets, Drowning Pool etc,. This album has a few real good numbers like Plugged In, Poaching Clean Water, Nailed & Loyal Customers. Overall a good album. Varied style here for you to crash your head into! Damn good!!!"
5,I see the world differently now,"Every once in a while you read a book that changes the way you look at the world. Sidewalk is that kind of book. It has made me understand poverty, the humanity of people on the streets, and my own self as I look at these issues. This is not a romantic or bleeding heart book. It is brutally honest, but it helps you see the human beings behind behavior that get defined as so bad."
2,Where the Sidewalk Ends,"Mitchell Duneier explores the world of New York City Street booksellers, many of whom sell stolen goods."
4,Nursing Time at Bedtime,"We play this CD every night as part of our going-to-bed routine for our 5-month old baby. It's very soothing, except that track number 4 comes on very loudly. We've had to program our CD player to adjust the volume or skip track 4. Otherwise, this is a very relaxing CD for mom and baby."
4,"Great toaster, great company!","We bought this toaster to replace a stylish Cuisinart Stainless toaster that was useless. We have the Pineapple yellow color. This toaster is simple, has wide openings to accommodate thick slices, english muffins or bagels. It is very easy to clean. After one year it stopped working. I contacted the Hamilton Beach customer service number that was listed in the manual. They sent me out a box, and replaced it immediately! I will continue to buy their fine quality of products. Especially because they stand behind that quality!"
3,"Not Quite What I Expected, But Pretty Nice for Its Age","When I first received the book, I thought Buy-Your-Books sent me the wrong book. Apparently, I received a 1976 copy (No UPC code). As long as the content is the same, I'm not too concerned, for this purchase (hint, hint).The content seems helpful, and the formulas are well-explained. However, as I don't own an HP-65 calculator, I'll have to figure my own way to enter formulae in later calculators, or maybe an Excel spreadsheet. I hope the later revisions circulating about address this, somehow.Ask your vendors if the version of this book has an orange cover or the one shown on amazon to be sure you're getting a later version, and ask if included programming and/or tables are updated as well."
2,Will work alright for a while,"This unit worked for me with very occasional use for about a year, then it died. Anything with a battery dies faster than AC powered devices and the planet doesn't need any more poison dumped into the ground so I'm going with AC power this time... I'm never far from AC when I need to air my tires anyway."
3,Works great for about a year,"I received a Campbell Hausfeld Cordless Inflator for Christmas a few years back. I loved it, as it was so handy to pump up lawn equipment tires. But after a couple years it would no longer hold a charge, and would only work when plugged in.I purchased another one because I liked it so much, and the second one only worked one year before it would no longer hold a charge. If you are looking for a one year solution its great, otherwise, save your money."
5,Outstanding[!],"This CD is a must for any reggae fan. Warrior King is going to take reggae to higher heights. He writes most of his songs and his delivery is very clear...anyone can understand his lyrics.. I think 'Virtuous Woman' was the best reggae song released in 2001. 'Pagans' is also a real gem.His new album titled ""Virtuous Woman' is also out. It also features some wicked new tracks such as 'Jah is always there'. It never leave my CD changer.Highly Recommended!!Keep up the good work.One Love"
4,An Entertaining Read,"Although not the best Parker book in the series, The Rare Coin Score is still entertaining, and gives the reader more insight into Parker's personality and character. The only problem I have with this book is that it's long on planning the caper and short on action."
4,Helpful workbook,"I bought this book even though I don't usually buy things that haven't been previously reviewed by customers. It is a nice book, I read through it abit and it looks pretty good, I would recommend it for teenage girls who are survivors of sexual abuse and maybe professionals who could have their young clients use them.The book might be helpful along with therapy, if you are more private you could answer the questions on your computer or in a seperate notebook, this might be a helpful tip."
3,Jack Arnold Rules!,"Definitely lack-luster if you're comparing this film to Jack Arnold's best genre films, but this one still has its charms. Biggest problem might be the rubbery mask/make-up, poiting up one of the few, and I mean FEW, advantages today's films have over yesteryear's. Still, not without its moments of tension. Might I make a suggestion? Watch this film as a double feature with Altered States, the Ken Russell film starring William Hurt & Blair Brown. Both film share the same basic story, though with vastly different details. Still, same story in both. College professor brainiac vanguard at the outer edge of scientific research plays with dangerous, mysterious substances and ends up devolving himself, Jekyl/Hyde style, learning an important lesson in the process, or something like that."
4,Load of fun,"Loved this one. Wanted a 4 1/2. It may not be a five star review, that is reserved for true classics. Still, this one delivers on all counts. Under rated Arthur Franz plays it good in this one. Supporting cast, except for his beautiful fiancee' and her father, are pretty much filler. The ""special"" effects are hokey and thats what makes it loveable. Its hard to think of actors being convincing about plastic fish and bugs [not mention the obvious rubber mask] but these are pluses. Jack Arnold is a master of more for less. Could have been a downer, but makes up for it with a fun story that is played by an earnest lead and allows the issues to be forgotten. Too bad a story like this couldnt be more contemporary. There are no real ""messages"" to preach about. Just non-stop entertainment."
3,SILLY FUN 50'S HORROR FILM WILL ENTERTAIN YOU!,"This is the last film included on the Ultimate Sci-fi classic collection DVD set. 'Monster on the Campus' is a fast paced typical 50's drive-in horror movie that will evoke some unintentional laughter in parts, but it does have some good qualities as well. There is a good well known cast and the special effects are better than some of the lower budget horror films from the time. The best asset the film has is ....it's fun! This is part of a cool Sci-Fi DVD collection mentioned above. The other films included are really good but, having this to round out the 5 films is fine by me. The DVD transfer looks great...very clean!"
2,Movie doesn't even try to be accurate,"I won't totally tear this movie apart, I realize filmakers take dramatic license to entertain. However, as a crewmember on the C-5 galaxy(the cargo plane depicted in this movie), I was insulted as to how cheesy this movie is. The producers should've consulted someone who actually knows what these planes look and operate like.On a positive note, it is fairly entertaining. If you were ever in the Air Force you will probably get a laugh about the wild lack of accuracy. The plot is basically a cliche, and the acting is, despite what the other reviews say, second rate. I only recommend this if you are bored and have seen everything else twice."
1,Not Helpful for Garter Snakes,This product did nothing to prevent snakes from nesting in my pool house near the pool heater. In fact they lie right in it and it doesn't seem to bother their Jacobson's gland sense of smell as advertised. I wouldn't waste any money on this product.
3,Missing Pedal,"I was so excited to get the Edge 288 Recumbent Bike and when I was putting it together, the left pedal was missing."
2,buy something else,"Fax works fine, like a fax. Cordless phone has suprisingly short range--not that big of a deal. The MAJOR drawback is the digital answering machine. ... . Recordings are difficult to make out. I can't tell you how many phone numbers I can't understand. Appreciated the efficient warranty replacement from panasonic. They replaced the whole unit for me. But, had the same damn problems. Spend a little more and get something reliable."
2,Handle melted off,"After several months of occasional use, the handle on this product's lid completely melted off where it attached to the glass! Obviously I wasn't able to use it after that. I certainly won't be buying this inferior product again."
3,Some Good Advice in the Midst of the Book,"'The Work We Were Born To Do' offers some very helpful information for those seeking to discover or rediscover the type of work that should motivate and inspire. Williams is full of positive thinking and offers many practical and helpful exercises, first for unlearning the things that keep our vision limited and small. Then he teaches how to reprogram your thoughts so that you can follow your passion, whatever it may be. Some great examples, stories, and exercises are included.I'd give the book 3.5 stars if I could. My complaint is that a lot of the theological thinking in the book is (to me) really far out in some cases and offensive in others. Christians reading this book should read with a close eye."
3,Soccer ball pan,I thought it was a round pan ie. a ball. but it is a flat ball. Guess I didn't read it right. Still it will be ok.
2,"See them live, skip the CD","I've seen these guys live in Moscow a couple of times, and I've always loved the shows. They are nothing short of fun, and occasionally these guys get in a groove that's so good I could cry. This CD on the other hand is just okay. The songs are okay, and the vocals are okay (although the improvs are really bad). There are glimpses of genius, but they are short-lived."
1,This CD was painful to listen to,"Mare Winningham is great, but listening to Jennifer Jason Leigh sing is like fingernails on a chalkboard! I have Lonesomers by Mare Winningham and I absolutely LOVE IT. I have worn out 2 CD's! Thank goodless you can still find it on Amazon and ebay! Her voice is beautiful and her lyrics are interesting and heartfelt. I love the way some of the lyrics catch you off guard. Her voice is so sweet & the music so soothing that when she sang ""too much ass to kiss"" I wondered if I heard it right. I highly recommend Lonesomers, but don't bother buying Georgia."
5,"Authoritative, comprehensive reference","This is an excellent book for the serious student of submarine history. It is perhaps the most authoritative reference book on the subject of post WWII submarines. Not only is it detailed and fully illustrated, it contains excellent tables comparing performance, size, etc. of various American submarine classes. One of its most valuable features is its descriptions of the performance characteristics of each generation of submarine and descriptions of how the designers of each successive generation attempted to improve performance. It explores, in depth, the characteristics of various generations of submarine devices, most notably sonar. It is fully footnoted and the footnotes often contain remarkable bits of info."
2,Turn the Volume Off or Down and Cick forward thru it,Turn down the volumne and wait for the action scenes and click to advance. Most of the movie is silly waste of time. I am sorely disappointed. I am surprized that someone bothered to make this film.
4,Endless fun,"I bought this and the hilarious bookHow to Poo at Workthe same month -> I go an idea : to use ""this Bang Toilet Seat Exploding Caps Bathroom Surprise"" in the bathroom at work. I have endless fun with this thing ! The best joke to Play at Work"
1,"don't waste your money, it's a snow job (and a sloppy one at that)","Someone somewhere decided he could disprove centuries of solid evidence of alien contact by cherry picking a few obscure, easily explainable(?) cases, and filling the rest of the hour with stuffy scientists babbling about the human need to touch the spiritual and why it's all in our heads. Never mind the Bible, Betty Hill's star map, the 50's flap over Washington, Hudson Valley, Jimmy Carter, Gordon Cooper's address to the United Nations, the Phoenix lights, Mexico City, Project SIGN, Billy Meier's unduplicatable photos and films, the innumerable trace cases, Belgian radar, Gulf Breeze, Kecksburg, Rendlesham Forest, the findings of the US Congress and the COMETA REPORT. They even call Travis Walton and his witnesses opportunistic liars. I used to have respect for PBS and Nova. Not any more."
5,great,This came as described quickly. It is very complete. I ordered a few other items which were not included and I would recommend this to a friend
3,Sweet Little Musical,"Mr. Cinders is an inversion of the Cinderella fairy tale with the gender roles reversed. The Prince Charming character has become a modern (1928) young and forceful woman, and Mr. Cinders (Jim) is the down-trodden Cinderella figure, a menial.Music by Vivian Ellis & Richard Myers, and the libretto by Clifford Grey & Gretarex Newman.There are two acts with three scenes in the first act and four in the second act. They are set in the noble home of Merton Chase.The show is sweet. The music is a lot of fun, and is very classic 1920's musical style. It's not a show that you will listen to over and over, but it is a great addition if you love/collect musical soundtracks!"
1,Unpleasantly surprised,"I ordered this product and it took 2-3 weeks to get to me and I found out why when I got it, it came from Portugal. I was very disappointed with the sound quality. It was like Aerosmith was preforming in a local club with cheap sound system. I wanted to return it but it seems it will be more of a hassle that it is worth."
4,Long Overdue!,"And by ""long overdue"" I am NOT referring to how long I have had this out of the Redwood City library! The authors take a very controversial stance throughout this book, risking their positions while assuming all sorts of positions, if you know what I mean. It was inevitable that this book would be written --I have been following its progress all along. Though I am not a lesbian and am not sure if I could ever be, I do know that if I was a lesbian and believed in Judiasm (which I don't, by the way) I only wish I could handle my faith and my sexual preferences as well as the authors. Kudos to them and kudos to all of you who will buy this book! It is truly a fantastic ride. Or read."
4,Industrial Gods Rock!!!,"I love Rammstein & will watch anything about them!!! This film has no music & little of the band in it, BUT it was interesting! Kids from their 1st school take about how they always knew they'd be big. I guess some people have that sort of presence from early on. Shame there was no footage of one of their live gigs... the CHEF is the BEST!!!!!! Love their pyrotechnics!!"
1,Light that $20 Up,"When i got this it was to late to return so i gave it away..you guys are better off burning you money.this has to be the worst cd ever. Dont be fooled by the other reviews givin it 4 stars, this is extremly boring and repetitive. i know AK produced this himself but sorry AK, this is fu**ing awful. Go ahead waste your money buy this"
5,Yoga like you've never experienced it,"I am a psychotherapist and much of my work centers around re-connecting with the body and the authentic Self in a healthy way. Angela Farmer's style is so compassionate. Her approach encourages me to deepen into the poses according to my own particular needs and inner wisdom. There is no pushing here to reach perfection, just releasing, releasing and releasing again into the perfection that is already there. I love the women in the class as well--various bodies and styles of movement. I often recommend this DVD to clients, whether they are yoga beginners or experienced practitioners who are looking for a fresh approach to their practice. Kimberly V. Schneider, LPC."
4,Free jazz via Vandermark,"Ken Vandermark originally included volume 1 & 2 as bonus discs with two Vandermark 5 studio recordings. Since only a few people got in on the ground floor of that deal, the CD's are now available seperately.Disc 1 has the ""bigger"" names of free jazz, though that's relative. ""Happy House"" starts things off in a matter befitting the song title. ""69L"" detours around a little coming back to the theme now and then. ""Saturn"" is a highlight - it's a catchy song, and the quintet does a good big band approximation. The rest of disc 1 are wrung out as appropriate.Disc 2 has songs written by relatively lesser names, but I think it's a little better than the first volume. ""Wherever Junebugs Go"" is a blast of blues. The next two tracks have catchy melodies. ""Scootin About"" is freer, and the Hemphill cover is another catchy one.Comparing volumes 1 & 2 to 3 & 4, I prefer 3 & 4 because they sound more cohesive. This is still quite good, and well worth purchasing."
4,wonderful,"This was a wonderful video, and great for all bike enthusiasts. Not as "" documentary"" as I would have liked, but certainly shows how far people will go to achieve their personal goals....."
2,Boring,"I found this dvd about cycling to be boring. Watch ""Hell on Wheels"", with Erik Zabel. Much more interesting story about what it takes to get through the Tour de France."
4,Amazing,Not very well done in terms of the quality of filming or even the pursuit of verisimilitude but it is still one heck of a story and certainly worth watching.
5,Bicycle Dreams,"This was a Christmas gift for my cycling husband and he loved it! I was expecting a movie, but it is more like a documentary."
3,I've had better,"Great story line and general documentary, but the film style and footage made it appear it was filmed in the 80's. Check out Ride the Divide."
4,Well done for the film.,"John Brion creates a well done score in Magnolia. The opening title sets the main theme for the film with abuilding nature. ""Showtime"" continues the theme and throws in the orchestra. ""Jimmy's Breakdown"" is well done and more gripping. The remaining music is similar to the start of the CD. Overall, it is nothing amazing, but it works well with the film. Still worth a purchase."
5,Score! Young readers will LOVE this!!,"What's more fun than firefighters, trucks, lots of action, and absolutely anything produced by Richard Scarry?The children in your circle will adore this fun book, that has absolutely everything to keep their attention through multiple, enjoyable reads!You can't go wrong with this one!"
4,Esl classes,"I bought it for Esl classes. it's not bad, in fact, i found easy for me. it will help you to practive english language. you will probally buy it for some ESL CLASSES."
1,save your money!!!!,"This is the perfect movie for a horney 14 year old to sneak by his over protective mother who found his dirty magazine collection. Its nothing more than Hot chick's striking poses naked with Kung Fo fighting scattered here and there. The only positive of this movie was the outtakes, and the ""child beater"" clip. Don't waste your money on this one!"
2,30 minute run time!,"The advertised run time is listed as 90 minutes, but the ""film"" itself is 30 minutes long. They must be including ""special features"" like trailers for other films and the individual clips of the fighters that were culled from the actual film itself. As for story line there is none. I thought the first 30 minutes were just a long, disjointed intro to the actual story, as it consisted of a couple brief fights but mainly some striptease style character intros. I was shocked to see the credits telling me it was over.The one thing I will complement is that they did use some very attractive women. The costumes were hit and miss, but some were quite well done. It actually looked like they could have made a cheesy-fun movie if they had a script, but instead we got a sizzle reel for someone wanting to make a real movie."
2,errors,"This book is filled with errors in spelling, grammer and puncuation. The story is interesting, but the errors are distracting."
3,Once in a Lifetime,I bought the Kindle version and every page had at least one typo. Terrible. If this is how it will be I will be sorry I bought a Kindle Fire.
5,Meadows at his silky smooth best....,"The very first Marion Meadows CD that I heard, Body Rhythm, was a favorite...I used to let friends borrow it, tell everybody about it, and used it when I was with a woman that I cared about.....I thought that there wasn't going to be another CD that I could love more....Until....Pleasure was released. I was simply blown away by the sheer beauty of the music....If you ever need a song that can take you mind off your problems.....Get Away is the song for you....It combines beautiful sound of Meadows' Sax, and the great voice of Nikki Richards. Every song is a testament to Meadows' skill and drive....If you are a true fan...then you can appreciate this beautiful piece of work. I, for one, can not wait til the next CD."
3,Okay,Very easy to follow receipes that even my wife can cook (trust me she can't cook). Not all the receipes are to my liking (but what book ever does) but most are enjoyable. Like the book just wished it had more of the receipes from the show.
2,"This movie rips off Airplane!, and doesn't even care.","At least the writers of Spy Hard had the brains to change the words. The writer of Backfire!, A. Dean Bell, doesn't bother to do that. He just steals the same exact lines. This movie is a bomb. And not a good bomb, either, like a movie so bad it's good. Still, there are some parts that make me chuckle. Starring in this movie are Kathy Ireland, Robert Mitchum, Telly Savalas, Shelley Winters, Josh Mosby, Mary McCormack, and, in a brief scene, 3rd Rock From The Sun's Kristen Johnston. (Did I spell that right?) Get this movie only if you're a lover of spoofs, like me."
1,the short version?,"I rather enjoyed this film, sleazy noir that it is, all 91 MINUTES of it. From the listed running time, I would guess that this is a truncated tv print. The usual tip-off for this type of rip-off is a Canadian logo, but I don't recognize this company. Caveat emptor."
2,Poor contrast,"While others have found these discs to be of good quality, my prints have been very faint. Almost impossible to see at the best setting. Not sure what the problem is."
5,I feel better already!,"I just finished reading this book and the guidelines for health seem so sensible. I am excited about putting this to use in my life... thanks for the boost, Cynthia and Charity!"
4,Great - but cheaper elsewhere,"Almost bought it here - but found a sale at toysrus.com. Bought this separate family in addition to the african american family (parents plus the two babies)/dollhouse, and my daughter and her friends play with all of them DAILY. My only complaint is that they don't have the entire african american family available with grandmother (and why don't they have a grandfather)? Great toy - can find cheaper elsewhere, and I found the african american sister/brother at ebay - because it appears they are discontinued now (but the one I got was new in package). Would recommend in a heartbeat (but wouldn't buy all the furniture - it is too much - and the kids have enought imagination to play with what is provided)."
5,my granddaughters love the Loving Family!,"This family set works wonderfully with the Pottery Barn doll house we gave our granddaughters for Christmas. We've only had it a few months, but it seems to be durable. They spend hours playing with it!"
1,Marketeers Cheapen Product,"Dundee WAS an excellent Orange Marmalade, but has been adulterated with almost NO PEEL and LOTS of PECTIN. Furthermore, it has been sufficiently sweetened to mask any remaining orange flavor. DO NOT BUY !"
4,The best part of the anime,"I do not exaggerate, the music is definitely the best part of this anime. Though the art is very well done the story was disappointing on several levels. This review however, is about the music.There are some amazingly beautiful tracks and some nicely exciting ones to balance the soundtrack. Choral, string and electric elements are all used to full potential. The final verdict? Buy the soundtrack, miss the anime."
3,?!?!?!?!?,"I DONT KNOW....I WAS THINKING THIS WAS GONNA BE AN ""ALL ACESS""DVD WITH COOL BACKSTAGE, CONCERT, PARTY FOOTAGES INLCUDING EVERYMUSIC VIDEO THE DEFTONES PUT OUT BUT....THIS DVD HAS NONE OF THAT, IT JUST HAS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE LIKE OLD HIGH SCHOOL BUDDIES,CLUB PROMOTERS, AND OTHER RANDOM PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE DEFTONES LIKE THEIR EARLY YEARS TIL NOW...I DONT KNOW I WOULD RATHER HEAR THE ACTUAL BAND EXPLAINING AND TALKING ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES INSTEAD OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ""KNOW"" THEM...SO IF YOUR A DIE HARD FAN I GUESS IT WOULD BE COOL TO OWN BUT ONLY SEE ONCEEVERY 3 MONTHS..OH YEAH THE DEFTONES HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THISDVD AS IT STATES IN THE BEGINING OF THE DVD."
1,Don't waste your time !,"If you buy this dvd with, thinking that the music of the deftones will appear. Your in for a extremly disappointing ride, the dvd contains an array of friends and pictures of the early years. But not once does the dvd contain actual footage of any of their early concerts or sessions. If your looking for early deftones videos, and live concert footage make sure you purchase deftones b-sides and rarities which is also available on amazon. The cd/dvd contains both early footage and great b-sides only found on import singles. If you just became a fan , you'll love it . If you've been a fan and don't own it get it . It's truly awsome to have."
3,Its supposed to be vague,"The purpose of the book is not to provide a blueprint so that you can plug in components and, voila, your warehouse is built. It is to provide a framework, a set of parameters, a way of looking at the task of building the warehouse. Probably explains why they call it the Zachman Framework and not the Zachman Blueprint."
3,Freaky Freaky Freaky,"I bought this album out of a bargain bin in 1986. Strange indeed. The lyrics are surrealist dada nonsense. Much of the music is straight-ahead hard rock, but also contains many jazz breaks and strange disjointed riffs. Fans of the ""Annoying Music Show"" on NPR will like this one. It's not great, but I do appreciate the all-out weirdness of it."
5,an amazing book for both parent and child,"I bought this book many years ago when my now 25 year old daughter was a baby. It is extraordinary. The illustrations are breathtaking, and I remember getting lost in them - much to the disappointment of my children who wanted to get on with the story. I still have the book and still enjoy getting lost in King Bidgood's world."
5,You child will love this book!,Audrey and Don Wood books are always a delight to read with children. The story is fun and the illustrations are superb! The CD with this brings the story to life for the non-reading child while those reading can follow along with the text.This story has established its place on my bookshelf as one of the all-time favorites! I would highly recommend this book to children of all ages. You can't help but have a great time reading this story!
4,Still Going Strong...mostly,"Purchased this battery as a backup in Sept 2007 for ~$35.00 and though it doesn't still 'hold' a charge for long periods of time, it does perform well when just taken off the charger. My primary battery just failed and will try the OEM replacementRyobi 1311146 9.6-Volt Ni-Cd Batteryat $15.00 cheaper, will see if it's any better."
4,Nice Bible,"This is a nice Bible overall. The translation is very clear (especially in the NT) and is beautiful in its wording. The liberal bias of the translators shows through (see Acts 20:28, see the note there) at times, but it does not detract. The notes are few and for the most part not very helpful, but are still worth reading, though another Bible like the NRSV New Oxford would be much more helpful. I value this in my Bible collection and get it out at times, but I would never make it my main Bible, whether for worship or scholarly work."
2,"It's a historical recording. The sound is not good, there are some videos in youtube from the same band with better recording...","As I said it is a historical recording, the sound is not good, the instruments and voice seems to be muffled. There are many videos in youtube better than this cd. There are too many little screams from members of the band during almost all the tracks that remember ""Speedy Gonzales""(something like: arriva,arriva; andale, andale, yhaa, yhaa etc...), wich suks real bad even when playing great songs. For me was a great deception, but there are some very good moments to. I don not recomend as a good sample from Illapu, take a look at the youtube and will see and hear what I am saying. Paulo."
3,Decent stand for the price...,"For the price, this is a decent stand. I'm the type who reads instructions and all the manuals that come with products I purchase. This came with no instructions. It wasn't difficult to assemble, but the lower base that is inserted into the lower tube was a bit tricky to initially get inserted properly. One then needs to place the guitar on the stand in order to figure out the best height for the long tubular piece that is inserted into the base. Once assembled, the stand seems like it will be a good, inexpensive support for one's guitar. I very much like the piece that locks across the top of the guitar stand in front of the neck--it's an extra bit of safety to prevent the guitar from falling forward out of the stand. This is a hard to beat price for a good stand.I tried going to the maker's website for instructions and Stagg Music site wouldn't load--even after several attempts? Again, figuring out how to assemble it is easy and shouldn't pose a problem for anyone."
2,Better options available,"First of all, the packing job on this was done terribly. The box was not even sealed and the unit itself came very dented and damaged. Regardless I put it together and I compared it to the cheap musicians friend stand I have and that one is of much better quality even though it is cheaper."
1,Leave Infant out of the title,"For those who are just starting your baby on solid foods, this is NOT the book for you. There are a few token recipies I think were thrown in (pureed fruit and rice cereal) but other than that the majority of the recipies are for much older babies or toddlers. Recipies here include whole eggs, milk, citrus and other ingredients that are not suitable for babies under 12 months. If you have an infant,and want to make your own baby food, find another book and save this one for the toddler years."
5,A very special cookbook filled with 150 recipes,"Compiled by writer, homemaker, mom, and food expert Joohee Muromcew, The Baby Bistro Cookbook: Healthy, Delicious Cuisine For Babies, Toddlers, And You is a very special cookbook filled with 150 recipes for creating meals that are healthy and savory for little folks as well as adults. Pediatrician-approved information on adapting recipes; recommended substitutions for children with food allergies; instructions for preparing dishes that can be easily refrigerated or frozen for a week; and much, much more enhance this compendium of practical, resourceful, ""parent friendly"" cookbook. From Pureed Summer Fruits; Spinach and Goat Cheese Scramble; and Vegetarian Black Beans And Rice; to Egg-Free Shortbread Cookies; Banana Bars; and Peanut Butter Frosting, The Baby Bistro Cookbook is an ideal addition to any and family cookbook collections!"
3,Solid material but dated,Dr. Resh's book is copyrighted 2003 but was first published in 1993 and it looks like there were no updates or revisions in this version. The information he gives is good solid technique and practice that is the basis of any hydroponic system. I would put this in the beginner to intermediate knowledge range. His diagrams of systems are strictly from a homemade point of view but the art of building DIY systems has grown tremendously since he wrote this 12 years ago. One last note - in his resource lists there is not one mention of the internet.I'll keep this book on my shelf for the next time someone asks me how do you do it.
1,Terrible!!!,Wow I cant believe they sell these as they are the most uncomfortable pillows I have ever seen. Ordered two of these and both have hard places throughout. Foam is shredded not a solid piece. I ended up ordering two solid memory pillows off of amazon that we're cheaper and much better so keep looking.
3,About Bernie Torme,"Not a detailed review, that having been ably done below, just some info additional to Jeff Goldsmith's comments: yes, Bernie HAS always stuttered. Audibly, rather than visually. In his case (and, indeed, mine) nothing to do with the RnR lifestyle!"
3,Milne's Life,"A bit longish and not a subject matter at the top of my interests, but well written.His life less interessting than his output."
5,Very good work!!,"Some very good tracks on this Cd.If you are a smooth jazz fan, you should get this CD!!!"
3,Sidewalk shaking,"PS seldom mesh progressive, metal, and melodic rock past the Incubus and Tool comparisons, but on their quest to approach as such, create an overall acceptable product with a few real sweet spots inside."
5,Old Penn Station,"Years ago, when I first saw this book I had no clue that penn station looked like this. I stood there in a bookstore, mouth agape, saying to myself ""This is what penn station looked like"" I immediately bought the book and was shocked, and angry that a monument like this would be allowed to be destroyed.I you enjoy trains or architecture or are a new yorker, get this book."
5,It's the Scoop-pee-doop-pee-doo!,I do alot of scooping dry goods out of bulk size bags. This measured scoop with its slick design and self-measuring features will reduce at least one step-- the second measure after I take the dry goods out of the bag. How? I'll just need to scoop once and flatten the top off of the perfectly dipped measure the first time. Anything that is time saving and has the kind of accuracy these scoops offer are a boon to the many busy tasks in the kitchen!Try it; you'll like it!
1,Cheaper if you buy seasons individually,"Obviously a great series. However, it is cheaper to be each season separately. (Nearly $35 cheaper if you go blu-ray from the combined price). They don't come in some sort of special set either. It seems like Amazon is just pulling a fast one if you're too lazy to order each season individually."
4,Great Resource for clinicans,"I was knowledgeable about Barry's other works but this latest one is a winner! I use it in a weekly relaxation group with my patients. My only wish is that it would have more than 2 tracks. Regardless, my patients & I enjoy using it."
3,Good but not great...,"The images are clear and look really nice on my new HD television. But they don't stay stationary for more than a minute or two. So when I'm just starting to enjoy the scenery, it jumps to something else. The other thing is the music. I don't dislike it, per se. It's inoffensive. But I'd have much preferred natural sounds. Water sounds. Or the option to switch between music and natural sounds, depending on my mood. It's a good background nature DVD, and I'll keep watching it. But it could have been so much better!"
3,I wish I could rate this higher.,"The artist, Koh Kawarajima and his crew are very talented and are remarkable at what they do. The art in this book is very well done with innovative designs, vibrant colors, and astonishing backgrounds. The style of the manga in this book is my favorite, big eyes, long hair and cute faces. There is about 64 pictures not including the pencil drawing rough drafts in the back. I wish this is all I could say about the book, but it isn't.The reason I can not recommend this book is this; girls that show too much. Most pictures are rather modest, but some go too far. A few pictures have girls that are barley clothed and some that aren't clothed at all. Some are intentionally sticking their butt and some are about to ""fall out"" of what they are wearing. Some are in bathing suits and some are in their underwear. This is typical for manga I'm sorry to say, and I can not advocate this for anyone."
3,Biggie Smallz ie the illest..,The first 10-min of it shows about his death and how he was killed. Then a bunch of other rap stars talk about Biggie and what kind of person he was. But not one interview or video of Biggie is on it. But if you are a collector like my self it is a must have!
1,A good example of holocaust and genocide denial..,"This book will appeal to nationalist Turks and westerners who have a vested interest in adopting Turkey's "" politically correct "" and sanitized account of the "" benevolent "" Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman empire's only contribution to the human race was the blue print for the ""Shoa"" - Hitler's organized and methodical extermination of the Jews , modelled after the Armenian liquidation. The World would be infinately better if the Ottoman Empire had never existed . This book is useful in studying the recent phenomenon of Holocaust and Genocide denial , which I believe should be punishable by prison terms as is the case in Germany. This book is an insult to the memory of the dead."
1,From An Oppressed Kurd In Modern Turkey.....,"A Very Mediocre Read.... To those who have not experienced Turkish "" Multi-cultural diversity"" policies...Please don't lecture people...It is like a one-eyed man leading the blind.... The British did everyone a great service when they destroyed a cruel Ottoman Empire... The book gives an indirect message to all authoritarian regimes of the present and the future...: If you abuse minorities and rob them of western-style free determination...you will be in BIG , BIG trouble....from the West...!!! ! Everyone should know how dangerous it is for a Kurd to even write this review...."
3,Frustrating but interesting,"There are just too many annoying references to events that have not been introduced yet and references to terms that are obscure and not covered in the glossary. It is eliptical rather than linear in its discussion of the chronology of historical events. The author is talented and interested in his subject, but too careless with the needs of his readers. And how about a map of the city of Constantinople, since various geographic aspects of the city figure in the text, but are hard to understand if you do not know the city. I agree with the general gist of the other readers who have given it a 2-3 star rating."
1,Not a history,"I too, stopped reading after about 100 pages, glad that I borrowed the book from the public library rather than purchasing it. The organization of the book, if it can be said to have one, seems to be stream-of-consciousness. The author seems more interested in impressing us with his erudition or sensitivity or whatever than in conveying information about the Ottoman Empire. Give this one a miss."
2,A disappointment,"I bought this book to read as a sort of sequel to ""A Short Histroy of Byzantium,"" and found it as dissappointing as ""Byzantium"" was satisfying. Perhaps I expected something else, but it's certainly no way to learn about Ottoman history. It glides through the first centuries of the Ottomans without any detail or coherence, then dwells on the fall of Constantinople with virtually no context. That's where I quit reading. I found the two previous reviews apt, but I wish I had read them before I bought the book. At least it was on remainder. This book is also a cautionary tale about relying on blurbs from a publication for which the author is a contributor."
5,Details which are usually unknown to the Westerners...,"As a student of architecture at the University of Florence, Italy, I had many occasions to make a detailed research on Islamic, Arabian and Turkish ( Seljuk/Ottoman ) art. As a person who loves "" details "", I must admit that the book of Goodwin, with the book written by Gabriele Mandel, "" History of Harem "" ( Mandel is a prof. of architecture at the Univ. of Turin, Italy, and he's an expert on Turkish history; but I don't know if the book is available in English ); is one of the 2 best books I've ever read about the "" everyday details "" of life during the different time levels/periods of the Ottoman Empire. A great book for people who love to unveil the mysterious and alien world of the Orient."
2,Informative but dry,"This book was quite informative, but exremely dry. I am an absolute history freak and read history books constantly. This is one of the few that I was actually tempted to put down and never pick up again. I persevered to the end, but didn`t find it rewarding."
3,An interesting but poorly organized introduction to the area,"I bought this book with high expectations which were, largely, disappointed. It was interesting to me, as a complete newcomer to the topic, but frustratingly badly organized. The decision to use a topical organization for the chapters, rather than a chronological approach results in restating the basic ideas in each chapter while confusingly jumbling the historical details. The lack of maps, save one very inadequate one in the beginning, is extremely irritating, given the amount of emphasis placed on geography (and I say that as someone who has, I think, a better grip on geography than most)."
3,Why can't the English learn to write?,"My one liner above is obviously a paraphrase of Rex Harrison's famous line in ""My Fair Lady"". Jason Goodwin presents us with very interesting information. Not only that, but it's history not usually found in the Western Civilization courses taught in most American colleges. Mr. Goodwin's sentence structure is unlike any I have previously encountered in either English or American usage. Besides the awkward phraseology, he uses terms that I take for contemporary English slang. Perhaps I am mistaken, but my main point is that I consider myself an experienced reader and I found ""Lords of The Horizons"" difficult to read. There were a few paragraphs that I failed to understand at all. But, if someone could undertake to translate it into standard English, it would be one of the best short histories on the subject."
1,A Great Disappointment,"Much of the criticism of this book in the Amazon.Com reviews appears to be from people who are hostile to Turkey. I am not. Turkey was a haven for my family for over 400 years (Jewish refugees from Spain) and is a country for which I have great respect and affection. What I didn't like was the book. I rushed to buy it after reading a gushing review in The New York Times Sunday book review section. Were we reading different books? I found the book to be glib, superficial, slick and uninformative. A fascinating subject deserved better."
5,Frederic fantastique,"I have long enjoyed Frederic Francois, and this a very good compilation of some of his best, better known songs"
3,older dsc-t5 5mp for $85,only reason I purchased this was because mine broke and I had already purchased a water proof case for it at for $75. otherwise I would have purchased a newer model for a few bucks more. good camera but newer models do better things for just little more $$
2,Just Okay.,"I own this camera also and paid around $400.00 for it. To me, that's a good deal of money as I am not a professional photographer but still desire to have great family photos! I agree with most of the previous reveiewers. This camera takes okay pictures. In fact, the daytime pictures are great. It's impossible to get a good night time shot though, especially photos of fireworks, etc. That was really dissapointing. The shutter speed is also too slow. My kids are already moving to the next thing before the camera flashes! For the money, this product is not impressive. I expected much more out of Sony."
5,cute little book ...,"cute little book, nice and simple, it was for a gift (as i don't speak slovak) ..."
4,Milton,"My son learned to read with this book when he was 2 so it is very special to us. I bought it for my grandson. May he enjoy it. Perhaps my grandson will learn to read it too. A simple, fun, easy read for children."
1,Whoa! This toilet won't compost without the (missing) system,"The toilet offered is only the ""top"" of a composting system that has storage chamber and overflow drain -- plus vent pipe and either wind turbine or battery for venting. It seems a bit disingenuous to list this item as a ""composting toilet"" as it is only the fiberglass seat/bowl requiring either the rest of the kit (about $1400 aditional) or an existing outhouse with pit (requiring some reconstruction.Envirolet Waterless Toilet (White)Having actually purchased, installed and operated the complete system (kit from Canada, PVC pipe and wood frame from local hardware, labor by myself and a skillful carpenter), the whole operation came to about $3,000. The final result has been used one summer season with excellent results.The item listed on Amazon is only the ""easy"" part -- the toilet that sit atop most of the rest of the system. No one (no matter how unsanitary) would be able to use this portion without the rest of the entire kit."
5,Wave of the future,New kitchen light only uses these. Happy to find them on Amazon. Works well. Seems to get slighter brighter after it's been on awhile. Light bulbs are changing over to the compact fluorescent bulbs. Suppose to last a lot longer. Have to wait and see.
2,Yep - not worth $70 I paid...,"We bought it on sale for $69 in July and it worked beautifully up until about a month ago, when it just fizzled and died mid-movie. I think it's the battery, but I can't find any place that sells a replacement and for the $50 it costs (per a review I just read), it's not worth taking the chance that replacing the battery will fix it. I've learned my lesson and will research into performance before I purchase another portable DVD player.Musing in Massachusetts..."
5,"irish Blessings with Legends, Poems & Greetings","I had seen an old copy of this book (""Irish Blessings with Legends, Poems and Greetings"" from Gramercy Press) years ago on a vacation visit to a friend's home and was enthralled by it. In addition to the shear joy of the work it ""spoke"" to my Irish heritage; so I coped the title, publisher and ISBN. Much to my delight I came across my note recently and found the work listed on Amazon. It is with great joy that I am once again able to engulf myself myself in the pleasures, beauty, wit, wisdom and humor of this little volume. I am thoroughly pleased with this purchase."
2,all talk no answer,"I'm not quite sure what I think about this book. I mean I understand that people only want a answer, a justification as to why a tragedy would cut John Kennedy Jr's life so short. However, I doubt the question will ever be answered. With all due respect, this book doesn't even come close as to reasoning the speculations of July 16, 1999. In a perfect world perhaps I might've believed the writer in knowing what John was going through and feeling. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure John did in fact have Oatmeal for breakfast that morning. So What! The truth is no one can answer for John, not even those who knew and loved him. His life was his own, it's just like the rest of us. And just like the rest of us, John was also just human."
4,The Day John Died and the Author Lied.,"The only thing I didn't like about the book is its' title. The book is really not about the day John died. It is a gossipy and tittilating look back at Johns' life. Being a follower of the Kennedy clan and having read most everything in print about the family, I still found this book full of interesting little tidbits about the family that I had never read before. Well worth reading if you are a Kennedy afficianado. If you want to know what happened the day John died, skip it."
1,a rehash of old people and newsweek articles,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. If you have read any old articles on JFK Jr. in People magazine or Newsweek, you have read this book. Plus, the author lifted most of information from earlier written books on Jackie. The first and last chapter were the only chapters spent on the day John died. The rest of the chapters are on how Jackie raised John. I could have clipped out articles from People, Newsweek and the Enquirer, thrown in old photos and written this book."
3,"More like ""A Short History of JFK Jr's Life""","It's a slim 360 pages, and reads very fast. It's much more an admiring picture of his life than about the day he died. The author repeatedly stresses the same themes: he shouldn't have been flying, but didn't know better; Jackie, Caroline, and he weren't too involved with the wild and crazy Kennedy clan, but were very close to each other; his ex-girlfriends were all still friendly with him, etc. He paints John's immediate family warmly, but is still rather dishy; one has to wonder how accurate his facts are. I expected the book to be more in the vein of Into Thin Air or A Perfect Storm, and in the end, I would also have to say I wouldn't have wanted to read about the more salacious details of his life, they do detract a great deal from his memory."
2,Disappointing,"After reading some glowing reviews, I ordered this book. Remember the old story about the guy who had to write an essay for class? He'd crammed on informaton about China, but the final exam was about Portugal. So he began his paper, ""Portugal is nothing like China. In China . . . "" It's sort of like that."
5,"Stick witn uncut, for sure","The anime is cleaner in this season than it was for the first season. Chibi Usa makes a comeback with an added bonus - she can now transform into Sailor Minimoon. It was okay... I actually liked the series better without her especially since she then figures rather largely in the next two seasons as well. The Outer Senshi make their first real appearance here, as well, so it was cool to see some new Senshi in action."
3,"very good series, only ok box set","this is not a review of the series. there are plenty of those. this is an aesthetic review of the packaging.i purchased the thin pack box set to replace my original pioneer release dvds so i'm able to compare the two side by side. if you're looking to save space, this is a good substitute. if you're looking for dvds that look really cool, go with the original releases. although these thin dvds do not have the tacky red ""geneon signature series"" stripe at the top, the backs of all 6 have the same picture and the dvd discs all feature the same image. they do not include chapter inserts in each case and do not have the reversable covers.as far as the video and audio quality i can't really tell a difference. apparently the entire sailor moon series was recorded in mono because every company who has released the show has done it in mono."
5,"Uranus World Shaking, Neptune Deep Submerge, Pluto Deadliest Scream!!!","This is my all time favorite Sailor Moon Season. The plot is great and a bit more mature than season 1 and 2. This is also the season where Sailor Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto make an apperance. Sailor Saturn is also in it for a couple of episodes. The storyline is amazing and somewhat alot of times emotional. Sometimes Sailor Moon educates me on things like friendship and love. You can acutally learn something from watching Sailor Moon... and its not just all entertainment. If you are a hardcore Sailor Moon fan then this Season of Sailor Moon is a MUST BUY for you!!! I know you will enjoy this season as much as I did. I got this for $40 but I would gladly bought it at the original price of $100 in stores. Trust me... this season is worth buying on Amazon."
1,Very Poor Quality,"It has been 5 weeks since I installed a pair of these...one has already burned out.A year ago, replaced with non-OEM and one failed.The originals worked for 8 years!All I can say is don't buy these...I am going to try OEM if I can find them."
1,Very kinky!,"I've only had this hose for a few days but my first impression is not good. I uncoiled it to put it on a hose reel and it kinked often and very easily. And even after it was unkinked, the hose stayed flattened in the previously kinked areas. And it's nearly impossible to put it on the hose reel without kinking. I've never had this happen with any other hose. If this hose turns out to be great I'll update this review, but so far, I'm not happy with it.*Updated 6/29/12 After 2 years the hose cracked in the spot where it was kinked. Now it's almost broken all the way through and is useless. This is by far the worst hose I've ever had and I should have sent it back right after I got it."
1,Nothing exceptional about this mouse,"I bought this mouse for the advertised features and used it for a full day at work. It's just an ordinary piece of equipment and there is nothing exceptional about it. I am not sure what they mean by 20X more tracking power, there is really no difference between this and an ordinary optical mouse. The scroll wheel sticks on the one I bought making it annoying and the scroll up and down buttons are really in an awkward place. There is no right/left scroll capability that you see even in a cheap $10 Microsoft mouse.The fact that it is RF and no line-of-sight is required, is probably the one and only feature I liked about this mouse."
2,Kind of a Scam,"The three step doggy steps are pretty useless for a bed. At least they were for us. No wonder there's an offer inside the box to buy the extra ""step"" for $15. The fact that there was no height measurement on the box is ridiculous. We find out it's not tall enough only AFTER we buy it. The steps themselves are cheaply made plastic with a synthetic rug on them, I don't see why they have to be so expensive."
5,The Finger Eleven cd rocks!,"the whole cd is great! If you like the group Creed then you'll love Finger Eleven! the cd is easy to listen to and it has a good beat. i could listen to it all day! the best songs on the cd are Quicksand, tip, and condenser. the whole cd is equally great but those three are my fave. check out the cd it will not be a dissapointment!!!"
1,"Our Lady Peace? No wait, it's Finger Eleven...","I was really excited the first time I heard the first few chords of ""Quicksand"" on the radio. The reason: I thought it was a new Our Lady Peace song. I was sadly wrong when I heard the lead singer's voice. For a diehard OLP fan to be fooled like this, I figured something was terribly wrong here because Our Lady Peace has a very distinct sound. With this in mind, I borrowed a friend's Finger Eleven cd, and nearly all of the songs had the same guitar and drum style as many OLP songs. As much as I am sure that Finger Eleven may be somewhat talented, I just can't respect a band that rips off the sound of another really great band."
3,"Good basic information, but not much beyond that","I bought this book as a new parrotlet owner. The pictures are vibrant and interesting. However, most of the information provided is more along the lines of general bird care. Therefore, this probably would not be suited for individuals with any previous experience with birds. In addition, the book discusses many other types of small parrots, which, in my opinion, weakens the focus and does not allow for as much in-depth discussion of personality traits and behavior as the title suggests. If you have never owned a bird before and are considering the purchase of a parrotlet, this book may be precisely what you need. However, if you are adding a parrotlet to an existing ""flock,"" it may be more helpful to talk to other owners instead."
2,Very disappointing,"If you are looking for information on the care of pet parrotlets, take a pass on this one. There are few pages devoted to that topic, and lots and lots about the history of the breed, and lots and lots about small parrots that are not parrotlets."
3,A different ok female violence movie,"I liked this movie more than others who reviewed it on other sites. Having said that, it wasn't great, and the acting was cheesy and forced. It is for the most part not terribly explicit either, unfortunately. This movie had just HUGE potential, and in that sense disappointed. But the subject matter is so novel, and the characters, one in particular, so disturbing, that if you want to see girl-girl violence discussed and to some extent enacted, its worth a buy."
3,I know a few guys who would like to see this.,"I read the summary of this movie on Netflix, and I generally don't go off of what most people consider ""good movie"" I judge for myself, but in this case my curiosity about the title won out..the movie was made very low budget. The plot can be believable, look at Jeffrey Dahmer, he would pick up male prostitutes, drug them, and cut them up. The girls are pretty,but kind of fall flat acting wise. The main character the ""Dominatrex"" was more or less playing on the psychological aspect of manipulation by fear and control. This movie was o.k. but I personally think men would like this a lot more than women. I would have given 2 and a half stars but I did not see that as an option."
1,speshul movie,this movie is definantly a waiste of money. its not at all what i expected...it is a cheap...soft core porn with no sex...corny cut aways to barbie dolls and terrible monologues.Save yourself the money i wish i could return it.
4,Simple and good!,"In today's overproduced, overhyped world of music, it is refreshing to hear two really talented guys play acoustically. I love the combination of old chestnuts like ""Stack and the Devil,"" ""Railroad Bill,"" ""Last Fair Deal,"" and ""Darling Cora"" combined with new, refreshing stuff like ""Pimp in the Pink Suit"" and ""Forgiveness."" This is great roots music that doesn't try to hard for that studio sound, but at the same time shows some excellent musicianship. The great ones always make it look so easy..."
4,"Powerful story, not-so-powerful telling of it.","The story of the last Welsh prince of Wales is tremendous. It is a story of human nature, of love, hate, betrayal, and devotion; of loyalty, patriotism, greed, and vengence. And in terms of understanding the events of that glorious and tragic time, they are as accesable to our hearts and minds today as they were more than 700 years ago. Nevertheless, Edith Pargeter's relating of this story left me less than inspired...Granted, inspiration was probably not her goal, but when I read Sharon Kay Penman's rendition of this saga, I was moved and inspired and enriched. It's a great story, it deserves a great story-teller to tell it. Edith Pargeter is good, but not great."
5,an excellent read!! she makes history come alive,"this book is great..seldom havei been compeled to read a book all night long because i ""can't put it down"". i'd recommend this book not only to history lovers but to anyone looking for a good read!"
3,Too many typos,"The content is there but the incredible number of typos in this book often makes it hard to follow the math. The language used in the problem sets are not clear so at times it is hard to decipher what is being asked. There are also many typos in the questions, which makes solving the problems difficult and lowers the usefulness of the problems in helping to learn the material. However, with the help of some reference materials (especially in the Laplace transform section), this book can provide a good basic understanding of chemical kinetics."
4,REPAIR MANUAL,"A very good book to get started with. It lacks in some details and proceedure, but is worth the price."
2,NO EXPLAINATION JUST SHOWING OFF A BIG MISTAKE,I THOUGHT THIS VIDEO SUCKED IT SHOWED ALL THE XINGYI FORMS WITH NO EXPLAINATION ON THE FORM THE PURPOSE OF THE FORM WHAT IT WAS USED FOR OR NOTHING THE VIDEO IS REALLY STUPID IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LEARN FROM THIS VIDEO IF YOU DONT BELIEVE IT JUST BUY IT IN YOULL SEE HA HA

4,Sleepless,I finished your book this morning at about 6AM. I absolutely loved it. A excellent and somewhat plausible tale that is very well written. I enjoyed it immensely and was never bored. The larger than life characters reminded me of Ayn Rand. Congratulations on a tremendous accomplishment. I hope it is very successful. AD
5,"As always, Calphanlon's delivers!",Whether you're buying Calphalon for the first time or are looking to find a fork to match a Calphalon set... This is the fork you want! 13 inches long with curved prongs at the end that act like fish hooks to take hold of whatever you want. It has hole at the top so you hang it up and it's strong enough to pick up the heaviest of meats (I use with the grill). I think its dishwasher safe (it been in the dishwasher at least 50 times and it still looks new!). Great fork that will stand the test of time...
4,"Sharp, bold look","I have a condo with large open spaces, high ceilings, and lots of big windows. Needed a lamp that was large and distinctive enough not to get lost in the background, and which worked with my other decor. This one fits the bill perfectly. Easy to assemble and adjust and a heavy base makes it very stable."
1,NO help!,This book consist of stories about the author and her mother and nothing else I was looking more for a self help book of why women tend to take after their mothers and how to stop certain behavior .
3,"It's still being enjoyed, long after Christmas!","The Scratch and Sniffs wore out very quickly! (too quickly, perhaps) But this is a book that my 2 1/2 year old is still very much enjoying, despite the passing of the season."
2,Sorry but this book just didn't hold my attention,"Perhaps I've been spoiled with some of the big name thriller books, but I could not get very excited about this book."
2,"Interesting, But...","I bought this book with no prior understanding of Kabbalah. Since I am interested in studying various religious ideas, I figured that this would be a good book to start with in helping me to understand just what Kabbalah is all about.Because of my lack of kabbalistic knowledge, I am unable to critique whether the info. contained in this book is an accurate reflection of the beliefs held by kabbalists today; however, I must say that at the end, I was still asking myself ""so what are the major tenets of this religion?"".Although it's clear that reincarnation is a major belief, much of the info. in this book seems convoluted, and it just plain didn't make much sense to me.I came to this book with an open mind, hoping to find some insights I could incorporate with my current beliefs, but I honestly feel as if I gained very little understanding of this religion, and no usable insights."
5,Son Loves Them,"My son insisted on having these. He says they are the best shoes ever. After 4-months, they still look new."
2,Not good... for basketball or in general,"I don't know why everyone else seems to like these shoes. I bought them because Nike shoes are normally great and I play a ton of basketball, but they are just not doing it for me.They look OK, which is why I gave this review 2 stars, but they do not work well at all for basketball or even for walking. They are extremely heavy and provide very little traction, making it hard to jump or perform any side-to-side movement. The soles are very thick and hard, so you lose your feel for the ground and slip and fall a lot. Basketball shoes should be like an extension of your foot... you should not notice their presence as you play, but with the Air Force 1s, I am constantly aware of the weight on my foot.My running shoes and even my casual skate-boarding shoes work better for basketball than these. If you are looking for good street basketball shoes, look elsewhere."
2,Happy grilling; Sad cleanup,"I purchased this reversible griddle because I did not want a teflon coated cooking surface. Dr. Mercola recommends enamel covered cast iron, so I was excited when I found this product. It cooks fine, but the clean up is terrible. As a result, I haven't used it but a couple of times - once for turkey patties and once to grill zucchini. I used olive oil on the griddle to keep items from sticking and cooked at a low temperature, but it didn't seem to help much. I didn't have a big problem with the items sticking, but it left me cleaning for a long time! (I'm still working on cleaning it from the zucchini!)Did mention this is twice as heavy as a normal griddle?"
5,Cold War 101,"this took me,a 14 year old inside the cold war iself. it not only explains the events,strategies and so on but it takes you step by step through the cold war and really gives you an understanding of ""why"" this happend and why this strategy, a must. this book should not be looked upon lower due to my words as a fouteen yera old."
3,3 and 1/2 stars really...,i've read over a thousand christian commentaries. this is one of the better. a few parts are dry but mostly an overall pretty good read.
1,Was not a 10x20,Was not 10x20 was smaller. Shipped late. Customer service had no idea when it would ship. The package said 10x20 and it was an odd size some kind of defect. I will stay away from these people.
3,Maroon!!!,"Ordered the ""Maroon and Black"" jacket. But understand that it is basically ALL maroon. It has a black zipper and a black inside. Not very masculine.I see they actually have the maroon black pictured on another product list, but they should really show that jacket on here.I agree with others who say that it does run pretty hot to the point where I have to take it off in the car. Was really looking for more of a summer rain jacket.It will keep the rain off your head, but don't worry the sweat will take its place soon.More of a FALL rain jacket for guys who are man enough to wear maroon. OR GET ANOTHER COLOR."
5,It works for me!,This is one book that you should keep just in case you find yourself hurt and no doctor seems to know what's wrong. This book has changed my life. Maybe it could work for you too!
5,Another excellent CD from Diane!,"I have just bought this CD a few days ago when it had just hit the stores. This is another excellent CD from Diane. I have both ""Aquaria"" and ""The Healing Spirit"". I think it is similiar to ""Aquaria"", but has its own style and song variations. She sings, chants, and hymns more in this CD than the other CDs, which is really nice because she has a very beautiful voice. I think this is a great CD to add to your music collection!"
5,Beautiful,"Heard about her from listening to 'new age radio' via the internet and was captivated. I got this CD and I just love it. Its been in my car for ages, played over and over. I swap it out and play something else but keep coming back to this one somehow. Spiritual, soothing, just very nice. Makes me feel better after a hard day at work. Well recommended. In my opinion this is a better CD than any of her others, I've also got a few of her others but I keep coming back to this one. Rhythmic, melodic, with musical contruction and progression. Great vocals, something akin to enya, enigma, deep forest but somehow more meaningful. If this Cd wears out or gets damaged, I would buy it again..."
3,The Wasp Woman,"You have to realize that movies like ""The Leech Woman"" and ""The Wasp Woman"" were not meant to be taken seriously since they were made mainly for the Drive-in-circuit. The wasp mask Susan Cabot had to wear, in 1959, was tight and fitted to the back of her neck with glue. During the climax she was really hurt when Zinthrop throws the ""break-away"" acid jar at her face. The acid smoke-effects nearly suffocated her because there was no open mouth area, just two little holes in the nose area. When she fell out the window she had to enlist the men who caught her to help take off the mask and as a result, took off a bit of neck skin as well! So, the mask was not a bad mask since it was so form fitting, like a second skin, and very painful!"
5,Serious Fun,"With a title like this, what would you expect? Please don't take it too seriously. It's just a real good ""B"" melodrama typical of the l950's. A rejuvenation secret prompts a desperate quest into darkest Africa to find a bizarre youth serum and something else...The realities and hurt of a bitter love story and the perils and unfairness of aging are presented in an entertaining few minutes. The old African lady, played to the hilt by Estelle Hemley,declares, ""You are the one in my dreams of blood."" And she delivers under the most horrendous circumstances. Take it for the fun of it.The star, Colleen Gray, is exceptionally good in a most unattractive and beautiful role, and this fine veteran actress delivers it with sympathy and great energy. No small feat.All women should cheer; there is substance here."
3,A good 50's thriller,"A good 50's thriller, a great movie for those who love old thrillers or ""B"" movies. The effects aren't very good, but hey, it's the 50's! The acting isn't half bad."
4,it's a great song,well i would have loved if i had this album but i don't. but i know from listening to the album version that it's da bomb!
3,A little disappointing!,"I have many books on ballparks so when i saw Kenneth Hogan's ""America's Ballparks"" i was intrigued into buying it. I have to say i am a little disappointed. The book covers a lot of old ground as these ballpark books do but the only things i found remotely interesting were some of the old photos that haven't been used in other publications. The book is literally 'thrown' together with a potted history of each old and new park, dimension and capacity information and interspersed with photos but it looks like it was rushed to meet a publishers deadline. It's worth 3 stars for many of the photos but it's not particularly inspiring in any other way."
5,truth and love,"I absolutely loved this book, it's a shame that it was so short - I finished it the same day I got it! The revelations and truths contained inside are priceless, once you read this you'll never look at the people in your life the same way again. It'll change your outlook on life, love and relationships for the positive, believe me."
3,Good but not what I expect,"This book is mainly about the readings for many people who where already reunited with their soulmates or twin souls from Edgar Cayce. I was expecting more explanations about what a soul mate or twin soul is. I was hoping to see information about how to prepare to attract our mates and raise the vibrations etc. etc. If you are looking for information like this, is not here. It is just the account for Edgar Cayce readings, I really got bore quickly, interesting but not good enough on this subject."
3,An interesting read,"This book was a pretty good read, however to realistically create a new identity a lot more has to be done...believe me. Also a bit more information regarding relocation would be helpful. This book would have been alot better if the authour had written more on what it takes psychologically to live a 'new life'."
3,Meh.,"This book is ok. Most of the repair in my camry was to the interior. When you couple hot miami summers (the car's first location) with cold Minnesota winters (the car's second location), you tend to get some brittle plastic interior components. Put that with a younger sister who didn't really know that much about the care of automobiles and you get SHATTERED interior components. Well, there was plenty of repair to be done in this vehicle by the time I decided to take it over and this book really didn't help me with that much of it. MOST, I just figured out myself. Maybe when the engine components start to go I'll need this a little more. But heck, it's toyota with over 175,000 on it. It's just getting broken in. ;)"
3,I took this ginseng product for one week ...,"I took this ginseng product for one week and really didn't notice anything different. The size of the capsule is rather large and I found them hard to swallow. I suggest using products with real ginseng instead of women's ginseng. Overall, the product is satisfactory."
4,"First, I think that the subtle effects of ...","First, I think that the subtle effects of herbs are difficult to measure. However, I can say that during this time I've been under a lot of stress and not sleeping well, but since I've been taking this product I feel a little more balanced than I might have felt otherwise."
3,It's OK.,"This DVD is a concert basically with other interviews spread throughout. I was looking for someone to wow me with their talent. I don't quite get that. He just kinda plays whatever he wants, whatever comes naturally. He speaks very calmy and tries to put himself as a basic guy."
5,Works great!,I purchased three of the black ones for my husband for Christmas 2010. He installed them almost immediately. We love them and they haven't fallen (yet and hopefully never!). I'd recommend them.
5,really really good,"Got the wall hanger right before christmas which was perfect and it does it job and that is hold he guitar,really good."
4,Better than a stand on the ground,"I like these and they do clean up my room nice by getting the guitars off of the ground. However, I have to be very careful when pulling my guitar off of these. Especially my fender strat as it has a small neck/head and I had to bend the bars a bit to get it to look somewhat flush with the other guitars I have hanging. For the price, these are pretty nice though!"
5,Perfect for any guitar.,"I bought 2 of these, one for a dreadnaught acoustic and another for a les paul classic and fits both perfect. All you have to do is squeeze or pull apart the arms to adjust to about any head stock size. I was a little worried at first that if might not hold the guitar far enough away from the wall but its just right, about 3-4in away."
5,A great guitar hanger to have!,I bought 10 of these. No complaints about the looks and the quality... just exactly more than what I had expected. Adds elegance to our guitars at our church while not in use.
4,wonderful light,"good quality, beautiful look, BUT the design makes it not very efficient in lightning, I put a 75w bulb and still the room looked dark, had to put some spot lights..."
1,"Says does not smudge or rub off, alas.. it does","Product says that it does not smudge or rub off, it does so much so that I would worry putting this on any dog that I put in the ring, how embarrassing for a judge to rub my dogs head and then have pure black hands from this stuff. Not even in the house is this remotely safe, if your dog is not a statue and does play or run around you will have an entire house of extremely hard black crap to clean off. I have tried the black and the grey and, both are horrible for coming off and don't look realistic anyway."
3,product with attitude,the product is a great value for the price however the seller has an attitude that makes you not want purchase from her again.
4,It Worked,I cant believe it but this book cured me!Although it is a tough read - the contents of the book help you overcome the pain. I highly recommend it.
4,Well written and an easy and quick read,An excellent read for middle managers and anyone who would like to learn or understand what processes are needed to take an idea and turn it into a working model.
5,THE BEST BABY SONGS,"THESE ARE THE BEST SONGS I'VE EVER HEARD FOR BABY'S. IF YOUR A BRAND NEW MOTHER, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THIS CD. THE SONGS ARE JUST RIGHT FOR PUTTING YOUR BABY DOWN TO SLEEP. THEY WILL TRULY BE SLEEPING WITH THE ANGELS AS THEY FALL ASLEEP TO THIS WONDERFUL MUSIC."
5,"Mom, Is That You?","I was a very fortunate child, to be loved by my mother and father (in my case, my Aunt and Uncle). I remember certain things about my early childhood that seem almost magical. One was my treasured ""Puss-n-Boots"" book. The other was a collection so stories that included ""The Gingerbread Man"" and ""Humpty Dumpty"". I am, uh... 40ish and I can still remember my mother reading and singing to me as if it were yesterday. Some of these memories are from when I was just one year old! When I heard the tracks from this CD I immediately thought of my mother and father, and those precious times Together. Thanks Mrs. Wildon, for this wonderful collection of Lullabies. I'm sure they will become cherished memories of many 40 year olds in the future."
4,Binoculars,"Easy to use. Stays pretty clean. I am too stubborn to wear my glasses to Sporting games, so these are a lifesaver. I can accually see the players!! Great Price for the product."
2,The Weight Loss Cure They don't want you to know about,"The book is a hype. It's impossible to follow the recommendations. It's not realistic to think people will have supervised colonics done for 30 days then go to a doctor for hCG shots for 30 days for their ""cure""."
1,Real pig in a poke,"What a waste of good money. Stick to the tried and true sensible approaches to healthy living. Not only is this impossible but probably very unhealthy. The advertising makes it sound so real and even says that you can eat ice cream, cheese, bread etc. How do these people sleep at night, and why have we become so desperate as to be suckered in?"
2,Not worth the money I paid for it,I thikn Kevin Trudeau spends more time selling himself in this book than he does on the actual content. For me it was a waste of money. I know others recommend it and I guess it just depends on how a person likes to gain information.If you really want to know about HCG and how it is helping thousands of individuals lose weight you can join one of the many free Yahoo groups that discuss it and download Dr. Simeon's protocol outlining the diet for free from there.
1,"If you have about six thousand dollar$$$ laying around to spend on the author's ""Cure,"" you too can be thin.","I am a white collar professional and still, by the time you add up everything that you must buy for his program (e.g., the cost of the fifteen colonics, all the supplements, and nutritives about 20-30, all your food must be organic, MSG free, nitrate free, regular massages, etc., the HCG shots and visits to a bariatric physician, you are looking at spending at least $6000 or more just to get started in phase I.He has you throwing out your microwave. So while you are at it, mine as well opt in for a personal chef!Now I see why he says ""the cure"" has been used by Royals and the mega-rich. They can afford it!!!For the rest of us, well we'll just have to keep looking.If you are real sick from morbid obesity and your obesity is costing you more the several thousand dollars, you might want to consider this book. Otherwise, no."
1,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know About,"the ""cure"" is ridiculous, impossible, and probably illegal. Don't waste your money. Trudeau fills the first half of the book with allegations about how other diet authors/doctors/etc just want your money and that dieting doesn't work. Then he suggests a 500 calorie per day diet along with injections of the pregnancy hormone (available only through a doctor, and no reputable doctor will administer it). This book is a joke."
1,The Weight Loss Cure,This would be a good book. Good Ideas if everyone that needed to lose weight were rich. Ordinary people can't afford the treatments he suggests
1,He's Craaaaazy!,"Kevin Trudeau's Weight Loss Cure is great bathroom-reading material. I found it to be an easy read, but would not personally subscribe to the ""cure"", which I consider to be such drastic measures."
1,Stupid & impossible,I can't believe a publisher would put something like this out. It's the worst plan I have ever heard of. It may be more harmful than good. I cannot recomend this book.Jennifer Robins
1,And the rich get richer...,"If you have over $10,000 to spend and can afford to take months off from work. Buy this book. It might be a good alternative to surgery from some upper class people.If you live in the real world. Don't bother. Exercise and diet remain the keys to weight loss."
1,Do not purchase this book!,Although this book promised to show ways to lose weight it was lengthy in reading to get to the actual promise. It repeated every word SEVERAL times. I found it difficult to read because it repeated everything. The solution was unrealistic and could not be followed by any one who did not already have the funds to lose weight by a personal trainer and their own cook. I would not recommend purchasing this book!
1,Don't waste your money......,"This book was a total waste of money. He claims on his ""infomercial"" that you just take this ""easy"" product once a day but what he doesn't tell you is that it is an INJECTION that you must get from a doctor. Some of what he said was valid but most of it was a load of crap. When he said you just take this product once a day I thought he was talking about a pill or something. Not something I would have to inject! Do not buy this book."
5,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know About,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know AboutThe book it self is a good book just long. - wish I could shorten it or have it to the point faster. But it is good.
2,not sure what kind of book is this,Taking medication banned by a government.. Well to be expected as the author seems to be very anti- government. I think he can associate with Baba Ramdev from India
2,Almost a rip off !!,"I did not care for this book, it was not at all what I wanted. The different things you would have to do to lose weight is a far cry from being logical."
1,Not Attainable Weight Loss,The methods described in this book are unattainable by most of us - since the primary component is illegal for use in the US. I wish I had known more about what this book was about before I spent good money on it. I don't have the means to visit Italy and engage in an expensive weight loss reduction program. And I don't have time to read the endless self-promoting advertisements leading up to his revelation of the unattainable weight loss ingredients. I wish I had spent my money on something better.
1,Monitor your credit card after your purchase !!,Not only is the book nothing short of juvenile but this company will continue to remove funds from your credit card without your approval. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CARD DETAILS - THEY CONTINUE TO STEAL FROM YOUR CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT.You will not be able to contact them to remove yourself from their fraudulent debits and the amounts are usually small enough to be an annoyance ($5.95 a month) but not enough to spend months tracking them down or filing official complaints - not to mention the $30 your bank will charge to stop them debiting your credit card.This man should be in jail.
1,The Weight Loss Cure,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know AboutThe author is a nut case with no medical credentials whatsoever. He says to take NO prescription drugs: NONE. He says that all prescription drugs are proven 100% to cause illness. (p. 90)The list of idiotic suggestions/commands goes on and on.
1,Just want to say THANKS for saving me the cash!!!!,"Sorry, this is not a review...I was just about the buy this book from the infomercial..then decided to check Amazon and the reviews! Thanks to all of you who wrote reviews!!! You saved me money (especially as a one-income single parent who can't afford to waste any cash)and... I didn't put $ in this crazy crooks pocket!!!!"
1,AMAZING!!,How can i book with this many sales be sooo bad. It was page after page of nonsense. None of it makes sense....Please DO NOT BUY THIS..
1,Poor choice,I was prompted by a TV appearance plugging this book; didn't live up to hype. Very disappointed; returning book.
5,Fabulous and Truthful: It Works!!!,This book is right on! All the people I know who have read and use this book are losing weight by the tons. This book could change the course of our country's obesity problem. But we just have to follow the money trail to see why it hasn't gotten the recognition it deserves. Believe me when i tell you that this book is true to it's author.
3,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You To Know,I think the information is good but he kept repeating the same information over and over again. The book should be half the number of pages and the reader would get the same information. I'm going to try the diet plan and see if it works.
2,why?,Why did I fall for buying this book? Call me old school but I will stick with traditional weight loss thanks........good ole exercise and and moderation of what you put into your mouth. Exactly where am I to get hCG and I think I will pass on the colonics! A waste of my hard earned money!
1,Rip off!,This book outlines a program that includes daily injections and is just a way to advertise things that probably this guy gets a cut of... Don't waste your money! I am surprised at Amazon for carrying this junk!
2,I don't trust it,"As with all Trudeau's books also this one contains some good info but there is also a lot of stuff that calls for mistrust. The author suggests some practices that might not be at all safe and healthy. What's the point of losing weight, if you get sick by doing that? The other problem with following Trudeau's ideas is that one would have to spend tones of money on supplements, vitamins, and procedures. And I am absolutely against spending any money to buy some questionable injections... All in all the author has some good ideas but mostly they are too eccentric, and possibly dangerous. So I have a hard time putting my trust in his writings. Instead I suggest books like Cure the Incurable or ""Can we live 150"" with plenty of safe and simple, natural solutions to health problems, obesity being one of them."
1,weight loss cure,This is the most useless book on the market. The things you need to go on these diets are things you would never ever find or would do to yourself. Don't bother with this book.
1,Useless,This book is useless. The weight loss procedure depends on daily injections that can only be arranged for at a select few residentual clinics. It is useless to somebody trying to lose weight and inches on their own.
2,Worth checking out from library but not paying for it..,I checked this book out at the local library - glad I didn't actually pay for it. I thought it was interesting and would probably try the diet if I was obese but only having 15 pounds to lose I'm not going to risk it with the shots and STRICT diet. So just check it out at your library and skip right to the chapters where he talks about the diet...
1,Save your money,"The secret is a drug that you need to go to Europe and have a physician write a script for. There are some good diet tricks, but average americans won't benefit from this without the wonder drug."
1,Unrealistic,"This book outlines a weight loss cure that is unrealistic for any American. The author states that the treatment is banned in the USA. Injections of human growth hormone and colonic enemas in addition to other ""dos and don'ts"" make this a book I am glad I took out from the library!!"
2,My dislike for this product,I was disapointed in this book. I was expecting to learn about something that I could do for weight loss that would be easily attainable.Some of the diet and weight loss protocol is good but the main reason for the weight loss in this book is something that is not easily obtained. I was disappointed. Because you are not guarrented to be able to get the product that this book is talking about.
2,Save Your Money,Save your money unless what your looking for is to hear the auther write 90% about how much he is not taking you for a ride and only 10% about the subject of the book.
1,The Cure you don't want to touch with a bargepole,"Take the longest one you can find and use it to move this book as far away from you as you can.Injecting human gonadotropin makes your body think it's pregnant, in other words plays havoc with your hormone system. This book recommends such injections to all and sundry irrespective of their physical condition or past history (what about all those cancer patients out there?)At a later point Mr. T. once again recommends to stay away from drugs of all kinds - well, let me be as repetitive as aforementioned Mr. T. and say again: Stay away from him."
2,The Weight Loss Cure,"Again, as stated in my previous review of one of Kevin's books, the idea is good but not practical. Everyone knows the basics that have been a continuous dieter all their lives. His informaiton is repetitive and some not very practical. I don't want to hear about his trials and tribulations. Half the book talks about him. I got bored with that and flipped through until I saw the impracticability of his plan."
2,Weight loss Not!,"This guy has some good ideas but goes pretty far out there in life for a cure. Getting shots for weight loss is not exactly what I had in mind. I am going to try some of the things in the book that are realistic like getting a shower filter but shots, I don't think so. Yes every one is entitled to their ideas and opinion and Kudos for him for putting them out there but out there in my opinion is where this book is."
1,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know About,"I only needed to loose a few pounds, This book was geared more for someone needing to loose maybe fifty pounds or more. It has a lot of steps (""Protocol"") to follow."
1,Bogus Weight Loss Cure,"Mysterious cure discovered by doctor who died suddenly that is used by nameless royalty and celebrities. I bought it hook, line, and sinker. And I thought snake oil salemen were long gone. How does this crap get published. 15 colonics and hormone injections are just the beginning. The one thing Kevin Trudea is honest about is that the diet and weight loss industry is big business. There are plenty of us out there willing to try anything and this is just another of a long line of people trying to make a buck off of desperate people. DONT't buy this book. Its worthless."
3,Kevin Trudeau's Weight Loss Cure,"This is just my opinion. The diet plan, though possibly 100% valid and does what it says it will do, is not easy for the common person to do, especially not in the USA. It also seemed rather pricey, a bit out of reach, just for all the new supplements he recommends. Also, my opinion is that in his list of things to do or not do for 30 days before the diet, I don't feel like they are all factual; in other words, it strikes me a bit as just some things thrown together, rather than actions that have really been tested and are therefore proven to be true. He doesn't offer much explanation for them."
1,Save your money,I was feeling very bad about my weight and on the TV comes this wonderful sales person. Nice to look at to. So I ordered the book. Once into it I found that this book has nothing I can follow beginning with injections. Ok so it says you don't have to do the injections but then you won't succeed. So then why did I buy it. The book cost me over $30 with shipping. Then I found myself signed up for this news letter that I spend alot time on the phone trying to cancel. There are too many people trying to make a buck on us the over weight people looking for something to work. Save your money and buy a book that will really help. Good luck to you.
3,Good resource but limited practical value,"Overall, much of the ""diet"" and healthy food guidance was included in both previous ""natural cure"" books; if you're not someone who can travel abroad to obtain the specific injection protocol, the majority of the protocol information is pretty much impractical/not applicable to the average person."
3,Ok,"I checked this book out at the library when it first came out and I would recommend that ifyou are interested in it, to do the same. The information seems good. And if you think about it...it was AFTER the book came out that all of a sudden, the HCG craze started. The book is not written all that well. However, I DID get the impression that the author knew/knows what he is talking about. I think it is highly likely that many folks, especially those in the medical field, were using HCG personally and then made their patients wonder what was wrong with them???? Why couldn't they lose weight and particularly why couldn't they lose it so quickly and steadily. Not sure I would purchase this book outright unless I got a good deal on it...but I also think there is some very good information in it."
3,Book review,"This book was ok. It did help me on the diet part, but it was constant repeat of the same old thing over and over through out the book. Bashing what corporate and the government trys to hide. I believe it, but constant repeating is like he was desperate to make us believe that or looking for ways to fill some pages."
1,WASTE OF TIME,Don't waste your money on this book.I gave this book 1 star because I couldn't give it zero.
3,Not even a weezer shadow,"Im going to make this as short as possible, this cd is ok, the songs are pretty catchy but not great, that is my over all fealing of the cd, just ok. Although the main reason I am writing this review is to set some people straight, THIS BAND CAN NOT EVEN BE COMPARED TO WEEZER. To say that this band is like weezer or even comes close to rivaling that of weezers outstanding music is absolutly insane! So In the end I would advise you to not by this cd, especialy if your a weezer fan."
4,An Enjoyable Listening Experience,"For those that enjoyed Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series, this release of the music from the musical episode is a jewel."
1,terrible,this episode was the longest i ever saw. the singing was bad and uninteresting. i thought it woudl never end. i love buffy but man that show was NOT meant to be a musical.
1,THE SIGNAL OF BUFFY'S END!,"Doing an episode of a popular television show as a musical is done for one or two things:1) It's a zany show doing something even zanier (""Xena: Warrior Princess,"" to name one), or2) The show is running out of GOOD ideasThe latter speaks for ""Once More, With Feeling,"" a horrible episode of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" which was part of Season Six, the show's ultimate downfall season. The season started out with a depressing episode, and the show never seemed to recover from it's depression. This episode tried and failed to do that. No matter how popular the episode gets (or how well this CD sells), this will always signify to me that this was the season that signified ""Buffy's"" demise. A bright note: ""Chosen,"" the series finale, brought back the humor, and ended the show on good merits. Grade: F"
5,very good,"When i recieved this cd i was wondering if it would be a good cd, i found it to be very creative. I thought that the actors and actresses have some talent as well. I just thought of it as a must for any one who likes the show."
4,"Oh, ONCE MORE!","This is GREAT! Loved this particular episode, and its so nice to have the music. I actually bought two - one for me, and one as a gift for a buddy. All original music, and the actors sing their own songs. There's also some extra tracks with music from other episodes.If they reprint it, I hope they include the song that Anya sings later in another episode that flashes back to this one. Too fun!!Only thing to watch - one CD was fine, the other acted a little oddly, spun very noisily, when used in the car. Oh, well, totally worth it."
5,The Best,"After watching the greatest show on earth for six years, this wonderful episodes airs. The only episode that can even come close to being considered better is ""The Wish,"" any-way Joss Whedon the creator of the show spent 4 months writting the score for this CD(For which he should have won an emmy for), with many catchy, and possibly foreshadowing songs. A must have for any fan, Pay close attention to track 2."
4,really good but cant wait till season 6 set.,"Well all I can say is that this was an amazing idea, adn it worked out splendidly. As mentioned before though, the actual visuals add alot, and they didn't leave in any dialogue which I think they should have. Well Sarah Michell, does not have a tremendous voice, it is very far from bad. SHe delivers her verses with good clarity and emotion. Amber Benson is definately the best singer in the cast, followed by Emma Caulfield and Tony Head. Jamnes Marsters is disapoinitng, since he is one of the 2 professional singers on the show. I def. recommend this, and I also recommend to buy the season 6 box set to get the full experience."
5,Truely Awesome!,"No long review needed. If you like this episode of Buffy, or any episode of Buffy, you will LOVE this C.D. So what are you waiting for add it to your shopping cart now."
5,"Bunnies, bunnies, it must be bunnies!!!","I love it even more now that Buffy is over. Catchy, addicting and wonderful. Any admirer of the show and it's characters will probably love this. The musical was a lot of fun and having the CD is a nice way to experience it again and again. While it would probably help one's enjoyment of this to have had actually seen the episode, some of the songs are strong enough to stand on their own. Most notable are the songs sung by Giles, Tara and Spike who actually have really good voices."
5,Music to sooth the savage whatever....,"""Once more with Feeling,"" a musical adaptation from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" Season Five, is absolutely wonderful. The collective works, lyrics and music by Joss Whedon, arrangements by Christophe Beck, performances by the regular cast, are so perfect and so satisfying (and should be to most ""Buffy"" fans) that it is difficult to understand why (discounting the tremendous effort required) the BtVS emsemble didn't create other musical episodes. But then the series might have evolved into another ""Cop Rock"" (""Slayer Rock?""), and television can survive well without another ""Cop Rock."" My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed (many times) the CD and the accompanying workbook, which includes commentary, photos, shooting script, and sheet music. These two (soundtrack and documentation) are a must for the collections of all real ""Buffy"" aficionados."
4,Inspired TV masterwork,"First of all, the casts' voices leave much to be desired and if you're not a fan, this will certainly not win you over. But once you get past these shortcomings, what is left is a really good musical full of witty lines and catchy music. Many times the songs are so short they are over just as you are getting into them. I would have loved to have seen an extended episode to really develop the music further. It's still a lot of fun and a must for Broadway fans who like modern punchy musicals like Urinetown, Rent, and Hairspray (and definitely not for fans of Rogers and Hammerstein, and Andrew Lloyd Webber). Of particular note are the songs ""I'll Never Tell"" and ""Walk Through The Fire""."
2,Either incipient deafness or this phone has big problems,"It's just impossible to hear people well on the headset. I'm a reporter and I need to hear every word. There are some people I can barely hear at all. This seems like a rather basic function for a telephone! If I could return this phone, I would. The other quibbles are minor - yes the headset is bulky, etc., but I would be happy to deal with that if the manufacturer had put enough thought into it to have a reasonable volume switch on the headset. Or is there someone out there who knows something I don't know about adjusting the volume?"
4,stolen rapture,"This book is an amazing book to read. Within the first half of the book, so many things have happened that you almost feel afraid , but longing to find out what happened next to Linnet Amberly. I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good romance, but at the same time likes to see a view on how women were threated back in the 1870's. And also the hardship of trying to make a life in a world that assumes something untrue."
3,Just not up to snuff!,"David Archuleta is a fine young man with a beautiful voice, however just not powerful enough for a choir of this size. Perhaps in a few years. Although I found the history of the mormans interesting, since I've loved their music from the time I was a child, however I think they took way too much time from the concert telling it's history. It could have been told in 5 or 6 minutes rather than the over 15 that they took."
1,"Really baddddd, joke stuff,super baaaad.","Don't buy this book, this book is the design for students who don't know math particularly calculus. This book is designed not for beginner or advanced but is designed for mickey mouse. The content is totally horrible just joke stuff that you can answer very briefly without doing any writing in paper/computation. If you want be a mathematician don't even start using this book. You'll be in trouble in the future."
2,"Its a Piece, but you get what you pay for.","I've had mine for almost a year, and its till works. BUT, its cheaply made, has little to no control over the sound, or files.Forget using this one at the gym. the 45 second shock protection seems to only work if the unit is flat. If you put it in a ""tune belt"" Forget about it.Battery life is non-existent. We're talking 3-6 hours depending on the battery.File control - There is none. Basic song skip and a directory skip that rarely works.Audio quality - Weak. It doesn't play very loud, and the EQ settings are wortheless.Now i use mine it at work, just hit play and listen to tunes all day though some cheesy PC speakers.My vote, even with the new models. Wait until the technology is there. It won't be long."
2,Purchase a Different Player,"The only reason for the 2 stars is because it was the first of it's kind. I bought this when it first came out, when there was no other MP3 cd players. It does work faily well. But as other reveiwers have suggested, the constructions is very cheap, the user interface is confusing and the battery life is short.One great feature is the rechageable batteries. You can purchase rechargable batteries, and rechage them in the player.Skip this purchase, and buy one the is newer."
5,Get up and Dance Music as well as romantic,I initially bought this cd only because I am a Marc Anthony fan and his song was on the cd.... after listing to the cd did Idiscover that it had great music.... The cd starts out slow and romantic with the talented Mr. Anthony then every other song is a song that gets to you and makes you wanna dance... but they intentionally saved the best dance song for last! The duo by Eddie Santiango and Huey Dunbar is awesome! I reccomend this cd to everybody it has a diverse composition of music and everyone is bound to like it.
2,Too big for the hole in my reusable plastic cup. (starbucks),"Thought this was going to be a good buy for me, but when they came in I tried to put one in my reusable drinking cup and it was too big. Sad day. I think they are good and sturdy, but not what I was looking for. A little disappointed. Will have to look elsewhere."
4,Fun with the Future,"I admire Ayckbourns' work and this reminded me of one of his best plays; ""Communicating Doors"". It's funny, sad and hopeful and I'd love to see it performed. The man is a true genius and thankfully he's prolific as well!"
3,A Few Caveats,"The ""product specs"" ... says this item has a near focus of 12 feet, but in fact it will not focus closer than 21 feet. The focus wheel is very hard to turn compared with a Nikon Travelite set I have used for years, and the linkage has about .5mm end play, making an annoying chore of focusing on moving objects. The collimation of both samples is poor, though not so much as to make them painful to use occasionally. The two sets I tried show similar deficiencies, but one set had no end play in the focus linkage of only the left side - a most annoying fault. Finally, Meade's ""lifetime warranty"" requires a ... ""shipping and handling"" fee, ..."
4,Great Item,"This is just the right magnification with a combination of light weight and easy to be stored. If you are an amature sight-seer, this is all you will need. Good for checking out the girls at the beach from a distance too"
1,Awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was terrible!!! I can't believe I wasted the money! The words to the music are just terrible. I know music is about the soul, but the themes and lyrics are so lame. I am no longer a fan. I'm throwing my CD in the trash."
4,Best cd since Sign O Times,"Well folks.....The Prince has returned (not that he was gone anywhere in the first place) But I'm feelin every song on this cd with the exception of Cinnomon Girl (a little to pop/rock for me & I was never crazy about little red corvette which is what this song reminds me of and because I tend to lean a little more towards soulfull, jazzy, funky and spritually uplifting kind of music) This cd is ""all that'. I have been waiting for this kind of work from Prince for quite sometime now and he finally came through. Thanks Prince! My favorties are , Of course Musicology , others include, Call my name, On the couch, Life of the party , illusion pimp and circumstance and Mr man. Over all, this is some of Prince best work. It's definately a vintage cd. Go and pick it up....you won't regret it"
3,It finally arrived....,I ordered this cd along with two other cd's from 3 different vendors. This one was the last to arrive. 3 weeks after the fact.
2,Ingredients Are Missing,"Almost every song made me think of a different era in Prince's evolution. I kept thinking this song sounds like he wrote it when this or that cd came out. The songs reminded me of old Prince without the edge, the power, the raw sexiness, the oomph. Someone called Musicology Prince lite. I concur. He needs to go back deep himself and find that old recipe. No carb free zone in my headphones!"
4,"Clean, Clear, and Crisp","While I have had an appreciation for all of Prince's efforts, this album just seems to hit the right spot. There is no attempt to have a perfected commercial sound. There is no real gimmic to the package. It's just straight forward Prince. My only real complaints about this album are there are a few too many slow songs and some of the lyrics are cliche. War references are just sorta thrown in there, although I do not see any anti-Bush stuff going on here as some people have suggested. The message is more like ""The state of the world is bad."" Although I'm tired of hearing about war if he wanted to talk war, I wish he would have gone all the way instead of references sprinkled in here and there. If this album was a bit longer and had some more upbeat tunes to match the hand full of great ones on there now, I would give it five stars instead of four. Regardless, it's worth the bucks for the casual listener..buy it!"
3,Not Deep but Fun,"I have to admit that I bought this solely for ""Cherokee Shuffle"", which is probably my favorite fiddle tune; the only thing wrong with their version of it on here is that it's too short. The rest of the CD is musically very good, especially the two violin instrumentals, and remarkably in keeping with swing style even though many of the songs are recently-composed. The songs themselves are not necessarily the most interesting, although they are well-performed."
4,Comprehensive,"It really wraps up Roman's like I've never seen it done before. It makes the Law of God real. What previously was dry and uninteresting, he (re)opens it up and shows us how it is so applicable in our world today, from the decadences of society to how even christians are just as much in fault..."
4,Amazing dance album,"I would highly recomend this album especially if you are a Vengaboys fan. Every song on this album is very high energy and danceable except for a few which are just a bunch of computer sounds. This disc also has three videos and screensavers. Don't hesitate in buying this. ""The Party Album"" by The Vegaboys is also very amazing."
2,Not What I Expected,"From the information provided, I chose this VHS as I thought it included the episode entitled ""Mr. Wilson's Wife."" It did not. I would like to return the tape, and receive the tape with the episode I wanted, however, I'm not sure how to do this as I didn't find any information enclosed with the tape."
1,Incoherent and poorly organized generalizations,"I am an experienced C++ programmer who suddenly had to help with some Forms design (no Oracle experience at all). The title of this book and the fact that Oracle Press puts it out seemed like good indications that it presented instruction in the elements of Developer. Not even close. The author rambles, does not provide examples when code has to be added to a control, and makes frequent, vague references to procedures found elsewhere in the text when giving instructions. How about this ""Create the list item as in a prior exercise..."" WHICH prior exercise?!? Scanning the text turned up instructions on creating a list item, more than 50 pages away and unreferenced in the index. Help files and online discussion groups were much more useful than this draft that somehow got to press. I would recommend this book only to friends with birds who do not get the newspaper."
1,Two thumbs down on this one!,Definitely waste of money. If you like a reference book this is not a good reference book and if you are new to Developer/2000 do not waste your money. Examples in this book are hard to follow!
1,Very poor,"The book does not contain any quality ""nuts and bolts"" information on using Developer/2000, but just glosses over the whole package with no useful information. I didn't find it helpful."
1,Totally agrree with the others' previous comments.,try a same title but by a different author and publisher (by Michael W. Stowe anf from PH).
4,Are you smart enough? ;),"This is an excellent book presenting the biggest weaknesses of Christianity. I admit that it is not entirely solidly written, and that author definitely has a personality, but it is an excellent tool."
2,A book on Star Logo,"This book is mainly about Star Logo, an extension to the Logo language, you know, this program with a turtle strolling around, for children to get acquainted with computers and plane geometry.Star Logo has much more features, allowing easy yet sounding powerful implementation of decentralized system, which one famous instance is cellular automaton, and some specific others in the book are ant colonies behavior, forest fires or traffic jams, with the cell of cellular automata being replaced by the notion of an ""agent"" (less known it seems to the public).If you need a book for Star Logo, this is the one to get, but if you are looking for artificial life and self organization alone, don't get it.Excellent bibliography."
5,what a story,"i got hold of a copy of happy hustler in 1976 i was a young lad coming out at the time, it was a good read them i just got a copy from amazon .co.uk and it still reads well back them there was no safe sex or hiv /aids what a diffent world we live in today"
3,Perhaps Good For the Uniformed,"The used book was in condition stated, delivered promptly.Book is ok, however, a little research on the Internet on the same topic will provide as-much-or-more quality information.The first part of the book is where you find information, the second part is more commentary on the authors person experiences, that may or may not be helpful."
4,Good Stuff,"This Lego toy complements well, the other packs which are part of Lego Soccer series. The instruction booklet is very elaborate and easy to understand. Though the toy is rated for children of age 7-12 years, my son who is 5 years old, is able to put the parts together by looking at the diagrams in the booklet"
2,The Silent Service Virgina Class,Very boring and not well written. Not enough detail The boat has intrigue and action __WRITE ABOUT IT!!!! Maybe then it will be worth reading
1,full of errors from page 1,"The author obviously failed in the most basic of duties - accuracy of unassailable facts. As previously noted Riker did not have a knowledgable modern submariner proofread this book. Communications, operational details, personnel circumstances, ship handling, response in casualty situations, ad infinitum, leaves this reviewer wondering if Riker did any validation of his works at all.I struggled to get through the first 80 pages before finally throwing it in the trash. I declined to give it to the local free book store for fear that somebody would read and believe it.Stick with Patrick Robinson, Michael DiMercurio, or Joe Buff for far-out, but technically proofed, submarine books."
1,Lightweight with many technical errors,"The story is OK, but this book is riddled with technical errors. A few examples: Submarine dolphins worn by enlisted personnel are silver, not gold which are worn only by officers. The captain of the boat (not ship) would not address an enlisted man as ""Mr.""; that mode of address is reserved for a senior officer to a junior officer. A yeoman would not be making notations on a navigation chart, as depicted in this book; that is done by quartermasters. A Tomahawk missile was said to be traveling at 550 mph, or Mach 7; since the speed of sound at sea level is approximately 761 mph (Mach 1), there is something wrong here. And the list goes on and on to point of distracting this reader from the story. The author should have had better technical input and proofreading."
5,Good Deal,"I was looking for a good sturdy metal stool, with a support handle at a good price. It is suprising how many different kinds of stools there for sale. It took some searching but I found it; good strong construction, fair price, good service.I am satisfied."
5,stool,"the stool is very well made and we are happy with it. however it was not the 12""w we were expecting. we needed it to fit in a certain area and it does not. if you are buying b/c of the 12"" w i suggest you do not buy."
1,Foorstool,"As a nurse am very disappointed in that the handle is not one piece, but contains bolts at the base and mid-handle. In addition, it is wobbly.In addition a nauseating odor emmanated from the top of the footstool. I tried everything to remedy the odor but no luck. I had to return the footstool."
4,Fun read,This is my first book by this author and I was not disapointed. This was a fun story that was highly entertaining. The romance was sweet and the characters loveable.The supporting characters were wonderful and I liked the small town that was going on.I thought the suspense could have been worked a little more. It was not that hard to figure out who did what. But there is the element of suspense that adds a little extra spice to the story line.I do recommend this story for a light fun read.
1,Needs some technical work,"Oh how I wanted to like this. The concept is great but the execution needs a little work. Pros- the explanations and scripture references. Cons- The music between sections would blare, then get quiet. Also, in the introduction it seemed odd she'd be talking to the camera, then a camera would focus on the side of her head but she still stared straight ahead like she was unaware. Something was just not right, BUT she gives great words regarding yoga and it is a nice alternative to some other yoga tapes."
3,wrong book,"This is the same book published in England under a different title. I had already read ""Mean Street Blues"" so I sent this back. Should have mentioned this in the ad."
4,Laptop Case,"This bag is rather bulky. Other than the bulk, I like how many pockets there are. I like that there is a pocket for school books, and then inside the bag will allow you to velcro the laptop securely into place. There are a few pen holders, and an extra slot for an ID card or Credit Card if needed. My 17 inch fits perfectly and can also be expanded to fit an 18 inch. I rated this item a 4 however because of how bulky it is. I use this bag as the storage when the laptop isn't in use. I don't enjoy lugging it around to and from school."
2,Targud leather quality fading,"I have bought several targus products over the years. Their quality standards were always high. With the TLE400 17"" the leather quality is poor. If i would have known this before I bought, I wouldn't have. Targus has lost my trust."
3,I was very disapointed,"I ordered this bag & actually sent it back. when I received it I did not like the stiffness or feel of the bag,too ridgid."
4,Targus TLE400 Deluxe Leather Case,"This case is perfect for my laptop. I have a 17 inch laptop and this case protects it well. Side pockets are adequate for carrying accessories such as power cords and external hard drives. Good price, I shopped around and this case gave the best bang for the buck."
2,Will not last long.,"I was forced to buy this bag, in a way. I couldn't find anything else other than the Targus XL Backpack that would fit my 17"" Dell Inspiron. Since I was trying to replace the XL backpack this became the only choice. The one good thing about it is my laptop fits in it. I had tried other backpacks such as various NorthFace products which advertised they could fit a 17"" laptop but none really could. The Targus bag looked OK on-line but when you see it up close its different. It's not all leather it has its fair share of pleather and plastic. It wears out fast. I have used mine for 3 months and it already looks worn and haggard. Only buy this if you can't find another bag that will work for your laptop."
3,Bag is too bulky!,"I needed a bag that was going to fit at least a 17in widescreen laptop. Ths bag would fit at LEAST a 21' inch monitor! Its just too much. I'd like the slimmest, professional looking, leather bag possible for my laptop and may have to keep looking. You may find me selling my bag on Craigslist! The compartments are great but the bag + the laptop are just too heavy for me to carry on a daily basis. I only use it when traveling."
3,not as big as the pic looks,"i got this book for my son who loves grave digger! i though what a great way to get him reading as well, but the book is small.. not to apealing to him at 5 yrs old. the shipping was on time and the book was of good quality, thank you"
2,Too small,I was a bit disappointed by the book size but our grandson seemed to like it so I guess it is OK
2,Ohm scale?,I need a meter that I can select RX1 on the ohmmeter scale. The specs don't say so I didn't order it. Don't understand the lack of specs......George
5,I Love Minerva Louise!,"Minerva Louise is so wonderfully drawn and cleverly written that I could read this and her other books to my son every night. I absolutely love this chicken, and the myriad adventures she takes. My son and I laugh every time Minerva Louise mistakes a common item for something a chicken might use, and get a kick out of correcting her. Just a great book."
5,Indeed!,"One word ""FUNKY"". I love this album to bits. Its a fusion of quite a few things, like jazz and funk. If you love these, then you should get your booty off the couch and grab this CD."
3,good mix of breaks,"This cd is a so-so compilation of breaks, both old skool and nu skool. The cd progresses from laidback funky rythems into sci-fi trance breaks. The tempo remains slow throughout the album, slow backing beats topped with neat sounds. There are better albums out there but this one is definetly good."
2,These should retail for about 6 dollars,"I don't mean to give it such low stars but I think there is confusion on the price. These may be a wholesaler selling large lots.I, think if you are interested in purchasing these, you might want to contact the seller and ask if this is a case not just one little set. I sell Toysmith products in my shop and these are not this expensive individually(meaning one set of 12 cutters as pictured. This would be the price for a unit.) I may have missed if it said it was a bulk unit, but just in case ask them."
1,"Too much soil, almost killed all my orchid plants","I bought this mix because I had good experience with other products from miracle grow. I used it for all my orchid plants and few weeks later I starting to notice my plant is dying off slowly. I then figure out it was the soil in the mix that rotten the roots of my orchid. The mix contains too much soils with little barks, similar to regular garden soils. I repoted all my orchid using another brand mix. Wasted my money and time on this product, never will buy this for my orchid again."
3,it's ok,"In hind-sight I would have bought a jogging stroller with a pivoting front wheel. Live and learn I guess. The tires do seem to lose air very often, which is annoying."
2,OK FOR THE PRICE,"BODY GLOVE EARGLOVE FITS MY EAR FINE. THE SIZE AND WIEGHT ARE OK. AS FOR THE SERVICE, THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. IT LOOSES THE CONNECTION AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF NOT BEING USED. SOMETIMES THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END CAN'T HEAR MY. I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS HEARING THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END. IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO KEEP SETTING UP THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MY PHONE AND THE HEADSET, IT WOULDN'T BE THAT BAD."
3,"ok, but...","Been living with this for over 6 months now, it works ok and the sound is clear and everyone can hear me fine, but it is sometimes problematic, as it is not easy to turn on when someone calls unless it is already on to begin with, have to press the button multiple times. In addition, no longer using it as I have lost the rubber earpiece and cannot find a place that sells replacements. Without this, the headset is useless and it is molded to go into your ear and helps the headset stay attached to your head."
1,what a horrible unit,"This unit looks and feels pretty good, but it works really poorly. The sound quality is mediocre at best; transmission is even worse. It had trouble linking with my phone off and on (while I understand incompatibility, I hate it when things work *sometimes*!).As far as I'm concerned, the worst problem is that there's no longer *any* support for this product (look at the Body Glove Web site --- it's gone!), unless of course you got it from your cell phone company, when they'll probably help you."
2,Not Worth the Money,"As others have stated, it has a fine ear piece, however the mic is only good in the car (with the windows rolled up). The people I talked to on it all had problems hearing me. When they could hear me, they complained that the mic quality was bad.I bought the Plantronics Discovery 640 and am very happy with it."
2,Not the greatest Bluetooth headset ever...,I'm sure there are better products out there. This one is not very good at all. I'm glad it was free with my phone! Would not recomend!!!
5,Highly Recommended! WOW! THIS IS WONDERFUL!,"It's hard to express the excitement surrounding this wonderful collection of some of the greatest songs ever written, performed beautifully by Julie Budd. After many spins, I am still in awe of Miss Budd's delivery of this spectacular material. Each track is treated with its own special arrangement. The chills you will experience are due to the extraordinary quality in both Julies voice and the superlative musicians that appear on this very moving and exciting CD. It would be very difficult to select a favorite track; From the beginning to end I am spellbound! Listen and collect the Julie Budd catalog. Here is an artist with extreme talent who is gifted beyond words. There are only a few singers left that can perform this material with such passion. Highly, Highly recommended!"
4,Flexible salt mill,"This is the first time I've used a salt mill. It works well, although I find the ""grain size"" adjustment is tricky to get use to, when looking for a smaller grind. Having the flexibility of changing the grain size is a great tool for cook's."
4,IQ Armor Case Belt Clip,"This phone case is by far one of the best with the exception of one very weak point---that being the belt clip. The hinge point for the belt clip is a very weak point, made of plastic and is easily broken rendering the whole case useless. I sent an email to Technocel of my complaint but received no answer. Why they would manufacture such a fine case and put a weak plastic clip on it is beyond me. My two initial cases were purchased from my phone server. I ordered my third one from Amazon, received today, but must return as I ordered the wrong one. I ordered the medium and need the small."
3,For the price they are fine- had them over a year,Some go bad after a time and some don't charge up as well as others but for the price they were good. I have switched almost all my batteries to the new Energizers- but at a dramatic cost increase!Stan
5,'krush'ing hip hop beats blended with jazz ingredients,"dj krush upmost track ever : big city lover (classic 5 stars)the remaining tracks... jazz-like style mixing in with hiphop/triphop beatswell,.... just press-repeat button on 'big city lover' that will do."
4,Give Me Tonight,"One of the Best Pop Dance Songs of the early 80s Give me tonight has amazing sounds to experiment with your mash ups and hard core dance beats.Shannon is more known for let the music play, but give me tonight offers a real dish of Authentic 80s dance with some unreal sound effects and breakdowns. A true treasure"
2,Disappointing,"I got this book out of the library and I'm glad I did. While there are a few interesting ideas and combinations that I would not have thought of myself, I was generally disappointed in the content. The majority of the recipes seem like ""filler"" as though a certain page count was required by the publisher. An example would be the ""recipe"" for sugared strawberries. Overall, I'd say support your local library if you're interested in this one and save your $$."
3,Missing Some Sweetness,"This recipe book is more like an ideabook than a recipe book. Many of the recipes are just like meat recipes calling for the soy versions of whatever the meat is (making many recipes EXPENSIVE). There are some fun and simple ideas as well though, some that just make a really easy recipe. Don't be afraid to do a lot of substituting--this book is good for a pantry scraping night (or week, if you're like me). One thing that this book is really missing though is desserts! Where's my sugar and sweetness people?!? You can make good vegetarian desserts in 5 ingredients or less, why aren't any included? My overall critique, okay book, but needs more sweetness and freshness."
2,way too simple,"I purchased this based on the positive reviews and have to say that I'm greatly disappointed in the recipes in this book. They are all way too simple and are directed towards folks who don't like to cook or who are just learning how to read recipes and prepare meals on their own. You could not eat a well balanced vegetarian lifestyle based on these recipes. This would be a good cookbook for someone fresh out of college living on their own or even for a teenager who has decided to be a vegetarian and needs to prepare their own meals separate from the rest of the family. It is not geared towards feeding a family at all. The recipes require little preparation which I""m sure is appealing to some but really you can't call it gourmet by no means! I personally love to cook and I make a real effort to balance my proteins in my meals as a vegetarian and I really just don't feel that this cookbook can meet those needs at all. It's way too simplified for anyone who is comfortable in the kitchen."
2,Not her Best Work,Some areas were so loaded down with facts that it detracted from the story line and was actually boring. The story line did not flow as it usually does in her books.
3,Leading Change in the Congregation,I found this to be a helpful guide to being a leader in a congregation that is experiencing change.
3,"Pretty Good, But I'm Not Going To Gush","As is clear from the 11 5-star reviews so far, JT has a loyal following. I, on the other hand, am a long-time James Taylor fan, not terribly rabid, but do like his stuff. This review may make me unpopular. If I could, I'd give this 3 1/2 stars.Only a few of the tunes performed on this DVD appealed to me. I liked the Dixie Chicks take on ""Shower the People"" and Alison Krauss and Jerry Douglas's rendition of ""Carolina on My Mind."" The rest were fair to good, but not great. (And no, I'm not a country music fan.)I enjoyed the songs that JT sang himself. It's great that James received the Musicares award. I wish the show was better."
5,Fantastic,"Whoever selected the performancers was a genius. I especially liked the Dixie Chicks, Allison Krauss and number done by Taj Mahal and Dr. John."
4,Very enjoyable,"I really loved this tribute. I enjoyed all of the musical performances, but I was a little taken back by Bruce Springsteen's performance. I guess I didn't know the song that he performed contained the F word. (I could have done with a little editing there.)Other than that...I just wish it was longer!! I was sad when it was done!"
5,A Musicares Person of the Year Tribute,The DVD was incredible. We enjoyed watching it as a family on Christmas Day!! We are planning on giving this DVD to a close friend. I'm sure he will enjoy it as much as we did.
1,Lose The Dixie Chicks,I love James Taylor but not as much as I hate the (Liberal) Politically Activist Dixie Chicks ! Its too bad that they would chance a HD DVD with their inclusion and turn of part of their potential sells. This is one HD DVD I will not purchase till they are deleted. Matt
2,Disappointed,"The trailer made this movie look hilarious...not so. It had funny bits but, for the most part was more of a drama than a comedy. Light British humor, which we usually enjoy, however, this time it just seemed awkward."
2,Viewing fatique!,"I first watched Ricky Gervais in OFFICE when it was still broadcasted in the U.K. He was both funny and mesmerizing in that series as the nosy-bossy perverted office manager. Fast forward several years later, I found Ricky Gervais taking the lead role in Ghost Town. Personally, I think the movie could be a better movie if somebody else is casted in Gervais' role. Why? Gervais was a dentist in the movie, but you just can't overlook his set of crooked teeth. I have never met a dentist in my life that doesn't have good teeth. Secondly, there was absolutely no on-screen chemistry between Gervais and actress Leoni. Lastly, Gervais isn't the type of versatile comedian-actor like Andrea Martin or John Candy whom can create unique and memorable characters at a drop of a hat. You get fatique from watching Gervais' two signature expressions rather quickly: smirk and sneer."
3,Change of Heart,"I watched this movie twice, three times... nothing better to do that week... love Rickey he's amazing! The movie is well acted and makes you feel when the main charecter actually shows he has a heart. If only everyone in America was like that... cared more for someone else then themselves."

5,cutie-pie,"I love this toy.It is a sweety.You will love it too.I love it because it is the cutest thing I ever saw.It will be very fun.You may love it right away. ... . I hope you like your new #151,Mew toy when you get it.Bye,see you later.And later you might be writing a review too."
3,Worth the purchase,Its nice to find a cd with the majority of songs a joy to listen to. The blend of songs are really good and you will find the quality of the recording great.
4,Get Your Fresh Diversity Right Here,"Real World should stand up and take notice...but looking at the early promo's for WOMAD USA, they already have. ""Traveler '00"" isn't just a collection of world-influenced grooves, but equal parts 'world music' sampler and beat-infused collection of tracks. Better in some ways than the previous ""Traveler"" sampler, this disc is diverse in every way--sources, styles, and tempos. With big 'world-music' names like Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Baaba Maal now contributing, plus their own parcel of artists such as the now well-known Cheb i Sabbah and rising fusionists Ekova, Six Degrees is now entering the big time for both the ethno-techno crowd and the long-standing 'world' audience. Pay attention!"
2,Don't buy this book if looking for good picture ideas!,"I bought this book hoping to get new ideas - but I flipped through it and was very uninspired. A lot of the pictures could be used for what NOT to do when photographing. Lighting was horrible in most pictures, too bright or too dark - couldn't even see subjects face in some pictures. Some of the pictures had shadows falling on the subjects faces! I took the book to my photography class and we went through the pictures showing what was wrong in everything..."
5,One of the best CD's I have ever heard!,"I had not heard ""Rigoletto"" until two days ago, and after listening through the 1st act, I knew that this was going to be one of my favorite CD's!As I said, I'm new to Rigoletto, and can't compare the CD with any other recording.When it comes to the singers, I can't find anything to complain about!Pavarotti is Major, and has an inexhaustible voice.It's pretty amazing that a man actually can sing a 2nd C# in full voice! And his 2nd D sounds like it's full voice, even if it's falsetto.I also like Chernov as Rigoletto, I just love his baryton voice.When it comes to the other singers, I don't have much to say; there is not much special to say about them.I would like to hear other recordings for comparition, and I prefer recordings with good sound quality.And I think I need Pavarotti on the recording, too, don't think it will be the same without him after listening to this..."
3,"Good, not great","How anyone would prefer Pavorotti's later version of the Duke here I'll never know. He sounds strained here, unlike the ringing, youthful sounding tenor he pocessed in the Sutherland recording. Sutherland is the supreme Gilda, no one can touch her coloratura and high notes and gorgeous tone. She was far superior to Studer AND Callas. Only Sutherland can soar above the orchestra in the great ensembles. Opera is voice, remember that! I do prefer Chernov's Rigoletto to Milnes, however. This is a good performance, but the Sutherland/Bonygne set is definitive choice, by far."
4,Adolf Hitler,"Adolf Hitler was one of the most evil leaders in human history.he dreamed of making Germany the most powerful country in the world.Hitler hated Jews,communis,andgypsies.He led to the organized murder of over 6 million men,women,and childern."
3,Probably good for kids,I was looking for a simple book describing Appomattox. This is really simple. The book was in very good shape as advertized and it was delivered on time.
4,Fun series,A fun entertaining series! Reminds me of Midsomer Murders. I enjoyed watching it and its well acted. I would recommend it.
4,Very good story telling,Always a pleasure to watch Kevin Whately. Really enjoyed watching the series. Hope for more to come soon. Love the Oxford scenery
5,Inspector Lewis,"I love this series & have them. AM waiting for the 2013 season to be filmed& available, soon I hope."
5,Love this show,"Haven't watched this set yet, but Lewis is one of my favorite of the british mystery series. I'm looking forward to watching this set."
4,Believable characters,I like the setting of Oxford. It also seems a world apart in the crimes the detectives investigate. The younger detective is intriguing because they didn't choose the actor on the basis of looks or sex appeal...
5,Another worthy British import.,"The 5th series of Inspector Lewis continues the story line started when Lewis worked with Inspector Morse. Lewis took over Morse's position following his untimely death (the actor's as well as the role he played). It is current and filled with the same detail as many of the BBC detective imports we have grown to know and love. And Lewis' assistant, Sargeant Hathaway, is also worthy of his own series. Shy, mysterious, incredibly smart, but very human. I never miss this show. Highly recommended."
5,Magnificent!,"For anyone who appreciates the art of Tabla drumming, this is an incredible recording. His incredible sense of time; his ability to superimpose hemiola figures over these odd meters is truly remarkable. The legato of his bayan playing, the clarity, all point to genius."
4,Good movie for young kids,"My 2-year old daughter loves ""My Little Pony"" toys, and she loves this movie too (when she saw the box, she said ""Pone! Pone!"" - she can't quite say Pony yet). The only problem with this movie is that the picture quality is kind of grainy by today's standards; many other movies made in the 80's that have been converted to DVD have been cleaned up better than this. Thankfully, 2-year olds don't care about the quality of the picture! This is one that gets watched over and over (and over... and over). Recommended."
5,Finally Found It,"I had been looking for this particular childhood film for a while, but had never been able to find a legitimate copy with good quality color. I was very happy to have found this one, and even more so to be able to share it with my nieces and nephews. They love it!"
3,Scatter brained reverse mortgage formula,"The book was okay at best in my opinion. It didn't seem to have any structure from start to finish. One section would address how the borrowers think and what each age group has been through in their lives, and the next would address something entirely different such as calculations, flip flopping back and forth throughout. For a seasoned vet, such as myself, the numbers and calculations were difficult to soak in. I could only imagine it would be much more difficult for somebody actually looking into getting a reverse mortgage. This book would make anybody looking into a reverse mortgage do a ""U turn"" as it was made out to be much more complicated than it really is."
2,Disappointed,"I am an old guy - 67 years old. I was trying to capture a part of my childhood by purchasing a game/novelty that used to captivate me when I was a child. The pick_up_sticks of my childhood were shorter, lighter, and significantly thinner than these. The game of my childhood had a light, natural wood color. The wood was finished and varnished. The 1950's pick_up_sticks had sharp points, which were useful to use as a tool to pickup other sticks. (The points of my current purchase were dull.) The objective was to pick up as many sticks as possible with high point counts. The point count depended on the color of the stick. This game/novelty really didn't cut it. I was quite disappointed. Had I not been exposed to ""the real thing,"" I might have been satisfied with these. But, alas, I had been previously exposed to the ""real thing."" It could be that our society's obsession with safety (sharp points, etc.) may be the culprit here. Sigh."
2,a little frustrating,90% of the sticks always fall in parallel with each other. Not as fun as the version of the game I remember from childhood.
2,A Nice Box,"If it weren't for the so cute/nostalic/decorative box that the pick-up sticks are housed in, this item would have been sent back.Like most people, I brought this item for nostalic purposes and to share what I use to play, ""back in the day"" with my nieces. Unfortunately, other than the concept, the pieces fall short of what I remember.The sticks are made of wood instead of plastic, which I knew before buying & was okay with it. I even thought it would be an improvement. However, the wood is cut thick, so the game is less challenging. Plus, the extra weight causes the sticks not to scatter well.However, for $8 the box is a too cute decorative piece on our play shelf, so we kept it. We'll try to find some ""real"" pick-up sticks to actually play with."
3,Tia Dalma Necklace,Nice replica of the necklace Tia Dalma wore in the Pirates of the Carabbean Movie. Great for someone who loves to collect memoribilia from movies!
4,"Wouldn't wear it, but it's nice to look at.","I bought this on a whim back in 2010 and it still looks just as it did the day I took it out of the packaging. Granted I only use it for decoration, but still, it's a sturdy item. The actual necklace is great and feels heavy (wish there was a back though so it was an actual locket) but the 'chain' part feels more like cheap mardi gras beads. I wouldn't wear it without putting it on a better chain, but at this price, there's really no reason to complain."
1,Definitely not worth the money. So many better books out there!,"This book was given to me as a gift by a friend who usually has great taste. After giving the book a good read (as much as a person can read a cookbook), I was left completely disappointed. It seems as if not much work went into this cookbook at all, and I was left completely uninspired. Given the thousands of great books out there covering the same cuisine, I would recommend others to not waste their time. I would return it in a second had it not been a gift. Into the attic it goes..."
4,A book of the Big Picture on Coffee.,"This is a book of the Big Picture of Coffee. It gave details reports on the legend, history, the distribution, the economical and political values, health issues abd environmental influences of coffee since it was introduced to the world from its place of origin. The book also talks about the likelihood of the coffee plantation workers or owners and how they are being manuiplated and deprived of their rewards and resources by the people who control the capital or those who have political power. A criticism I have to make is that the book reports little on what the concerned people have done to help the poor coffee workers to improve their lot. In sum, this is a good book on the economical, political and social issues of coffee. This is not a book about beans, brewing method or equipments."
3,Comprehensive history focused mainly on America,"Uncommon Grounds gives a comprehensive history of coffee and it's impact on the Americas, with detailed accounts of all the major occurances in the United States market and production in Latin America.Uncommon Grounds focuses mainly on coffee's impact on America with details of their market and it's influences, brands and their heritage, and how coffee impacted the American people. It goes into detailed descriptions of the marketing campaigns used by various American brands and how they ebbed and flowed. It would be a great book for someone studying marketing or working in a marketing role in the coffee industry.So many areas remained untouched or skimmed over such as the markets in Europe, Asia and other parts of the globe. I would have also liked to read much more about the coffee growing nations outside of Latin America.Overall, I did enjoy reading it, though I was disappointed by such a narrow view of the world."
5,Memorable,"I read it when I was grade school. Today, after some 15 years, it is still my favorite book."
4,Very tasty,"I bought these for our office and they are extremely tasty. Their only drawback is price. Even with the sale I got them on, they cost nearly twice as much as the ""normal"" brands for half as much product. However, they are still quick to be bought by the staff because they taste so darn good.If they would only make 2 oz. bags for the same price!One last thought: I live in the Rocky Mountains and the shipping went over the passes in Colorado. Some of the bags lost their air and became vacuum packed as they came back down. The chips were OK, but the bags looked like they had nearly nothing in them! This is the case for many air packed and sealed items I buy East of the Rockies."
5,Perfect BBQ FLAVOR!,"I decided to try these after being a Salt & Vinegar fan- my kids actually made me! Great BBQ flavor- not too spicy and slightly sweet - they are the first chip that has a clean BBQ flavor (can taste mesquite and hickory) and aren't ""artificial"" tasting. Also not as ""salty"" as most BBQ chips."
5,The greatest salt and vinegar chips.,"I LOVE these chips. I would buy them at home in Vermont all the time because they're my favorite. Now that I'm in New York, I wish I could find them in stores but I instead have to purchase them in bulk online. The salt and vinegar are my favorite snack ever, no other brand of chips compares."
2,Buyer Beware,I bought this product for my 2 cats who are age 4 and 5. I tried brushing with just water first. I had a hard time even getting the cats to keep their mouths open. I was able to brush one of my cat's side teeth but it made his gums bleed.
2,Stan and Ollie's Second Talkie,"""Berth Marks"" (1929) finds Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy adapting their silent slapstick to the early talkie format. The opening sequence at the train station is a self-contained gem that utilizes sound to creative effect. However, when Stan and Ollie get on board the last train to Pottsville, the physical humor becomes increasingly awkward and repetitive. One of the team's weakest two-reelers."
4,"Yes, it's different.","Yes, the earliness of 'Berth Marks' is its salient trait. But what could be funnier than the line delivered by the train conductor, when told the boys are a 'big-time vaudeville act' going to Pottsville: ""Well, I'll bet yer GOOD,"" as they look uncomprehending. Granted the assorted contortions in the upper berth go on too long. But in the final scene, when Ollie lobs a stone at the fleeing Stan (for having left their fiddle behind on the now-departed train) and clunks him, and Stan picks up a stone to lob back then thinks better of it, we have vintage L&H. It's a personal favorite of mine, not least for the bouncy musical score...but it IS different, because it is EARLY!"
3,Better than electric but.......,"I have owned this hedge trimmer for about 2 years now, and it recently died. The pull rope no longer recoils back into the motor, making it impossible to start. My overall impression of the trimmer is that if the pull mechanism didn't break, something else would have, although I must admit, when it ran, it ran well. The stainless steel cutting blades are also an advantage (no rust). Not the highest quality machine, but if your happy with the knowledge that it won't last longer than 2 or 3 seasons use, go for it. PS........ As with all gas trimmers, earplugs are a MUST!!! I almost went deaf after the first time I used it."
4,A good soft toy for toddler,"My 15 month old loves Toy Story movies and shorts, and this was the first toy he really identified with something. It doesn't beep or light up or talk - it's just a soft toy, safe for toddlers. If you're looking for an exact replica - pick something else. But we've had a lot of fun with this, and it seems to hold up well, too. Highly recommend for very young children."
3,Touches on in depth issues of win32 programming,"Nice book that touches on in depth issues of win32 programming such as file handling, registry, memory issues, etc."
1,Terrible Set,This set of horseshoes is cast and not forged. One of the horseshoes broke in half after only five minutes of playing. The set will not last for very long before breaking. Will be returning these and getting a set of forged steel shoes.
5,Great book,I am very happy with this book. It is one that I used to get from the library all the time and then decided that it made sense to buy it and use it as sort of a referance book. I have done many of the paintings from it and have found it very useful. Not all are great but working your way through them you can not help but learn.
3,Quality Not What Was Expected,"Although the product arrived in a timely fashion, I was not pleased with the quality of the fabric. The fabric is very light-weight. Also of concern was the sizing. The medium was ordered and fit too snugly. My husband is very slightly built and usually can wear a small. It was a good thing that I ordered a a medium just to make sure he had enough room. Because we were on a time-line to travel to a Grandparent's Day 50s celebration, the product was not returned.Diamond Pins White & Black RetroBowler Bowling Shirt"
4,I dig these sexy jazz tunes!,"I would only perhaps skip over 4 and/or 6, but for the most part, I listen to it over and over. I heard the first one, and I think in some ways this is better (less obviously wokka-wokka)."
5,My favorite childhood book,"When I think of 10 or 12 years ago, I think of my mom, my younger sister and I, curled up in moms big bed, reading grandfather twilight with her everynight before going to sleep. I will always remember tracing my finger over the soft-looking, bubbly streams in the pictures and that peaceful, sleepy feeling you get as a small child. Some of my best childhood memories are in this book. I still have our copy of it, worn and faded, sitting on my bookshelf. I still love to run my fingers over the streams,even even as a 17 year old. but shhh dont tell anyone."
2,"A duty, not a pleasure","Bonnano's Star Trek world is highly flawed. It is mostly boring. For some reason, Bonnano thinks writing a book consists of narrating the most mundane of hand and facial gestures to accompany what amounted to tidbits of dialogue. The ratio of dialogue to narrative verbosity is tiring. The only type of person who will want to read this book is the dedicated Star Trek fan (any ""series"" fan is at one time or another a sucker for punishment), a reader who doesn't give up reading a book for the sake of finishing something he or she has started, or a reader who doesn't know the difference between good and bad writing.Immediately afterward, I began reading Friedman's ""SHADOWS ON THE SUN"", also a Star Trek novel. Friedman is an example of not only a competent writer, but also a true Star Trek fan. I hope Bonnano never writes another Star Trek novel again."
5,One of a kind band,This is the most interesting and one of greatest bands i have ever seen. Just buy it! U'll love it. I love it. Too bad those guys don't make albums anymore.
5,One of Aeoliah's best,"Extremly subtle, etheral, and relaxing. If you enjoyed ""Angel Love"" then will certainly enjoy this CD."
5,Buddha's Life Explained in Japanese Manga style,"This is the last of the 8-volume ""Buddha"" series. This graphical biography of a religious leader is great and understandable in the Japanese manga style. There is also scenes of non-sequitar humor injected by the artist as ""comic relief"". Readers of all ages will love all 8 volumes."
5,Colette Barton Reid-I Am/Grace,I had heard snippets on her website and was very happy to actual get the CD. The songs are inspirational and her voice is pure. I highly recommend this artist and CD.
5,Get this CD you won't be sorry.,I read the other reviews before ordering. I can't understand how Amazon's reviewer could call this CD underwhelming. This CD is absolutely fantastic. I can't wait for the next one!
2,"A magnificent recording of ""nothing"" music","Let me be fair. Fleming is fantastic, Heppner sings gorgeously and Mackerras conducts with flair and style. With the exception of Zajick's loud, ugly voice, this is a performance to die for. But a performance of WHAT? Treacle, that's what. Dramatically uninteresting, musically sugary and vapid, this is one opera that should have been left unrecorded. ""O lovely moon"" is the best thing in it. Buy the recital, don't waste your money on the complete thing."
3,"Good hardware, bad elevation calculation, clueless support","The hardware of the eTrex Vista HCx works well, and it seems to record reasonable elevation numbers in the tracks. But, the calculated total ascent with software version 2.5 is too low by a factor of at least 2, compared to other devices as well as to a friends Vista HCx with software version 2.3. Although several users (at least) have sent messages to Garmin about the problem (and posted copies of their messages to various forums), the people that answer the phone in tech support claim to know nothing about it. So if you care about the total ascent calculation, you should avoid this unit until Garmin first acknowledges that there is a problem and second, fixes it."
2,Where's the Maps?,I bought the Garmin Etrex Vista HCx unit to go geocaching with my boy scouts and I have been seriously disappointed... The unit is not as accurate as I had hoped and does not contain detailed maps out of the box - additional maps are REQUIRED! Way to go Garmin Marketing Monkeys you have made the unit useless out of the box! I would suggest you put a warning on the unit that states the basemap is not accurate and additional maps are required for accuracy greater than 500 feet.
4,Garmin eTrex Vista HCx GPS unit,"I'm very pleased with the Garmin eTrex Vista HCx. Good battery life, high sensitivity -- the unit can receive nine satelites from inside my house! Once you get used to the functions, it is easy to move from page to page and the unit itself is excellent. However, the people who write the technical manuals (instructions) need to go back to school. The manual describes all of the functions well, but if you are a novice user, it leaves you with all kinds of questions about how this or that works. In short, it does not explain how it can be used, only how it works. Except for the instruction booklet, I am very happy with the product itself."
3,SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED DEVICE TO OPERATE,THIS UNIT HAS WHAT APPEARS TO BE MANY USEFUL FUNCTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY UNLESS YOU ARE VERY LITERATE IN THE OPERATION OF THIS TYPE OF DEVICE YOU'LL BECOME FRUSTRATED AND PROBABLY NOT USE IT. I FOUND IT TO BE NOT USER FRIENDLY.
1,Be careful with this latest manufacturing batch,"Be careful with this latest manufacturing batch. It appears that Garmin is shipping junk, again. This most recent batch of units seems to be prone to locking up after limited use. See the following for more details.[...]or google search for ""eTrex Vista HCX Locks up""Does not appear to be isolated, and dose seem to indicate that you may want to hold off purchasing this unit until the problems are resolved.Otherwise it is a good unit, it is just limited by the fact that it stops working after a few minutes."
4,Replacment Handheld GPS,"I purchased this unit to replace a similar GPS from Garmin that the neighborhood tweakers lifted from me last year. I liked the simplicity of use of my old handheld, and found the Garmin had incorporated the same design features of the older model into the Vista Hcx. And the expanded memory is great, I am now able to carry more of the western US and is stil easy to use and set up,Thomas D. Smith, PG"
4,As expected,"Not the most user friendly device as we're still trying to figure it out after 3 weeks, but it seems accurate and has a ton of features. Altimiter seems to drift quite a bit but I'm not sure whether there are any that do better.. ?"
4,Garmin Vista HCX,Excellent piece of GPS for its price. I previously owned a Vista Cx and found the reception of the HCX to be far superior. Use it a lot for mountain biking under various degrees of jungle canopy thickness and no issues with reception thus far. And that's with the GPS thucked inside my pants pocket ! Fast acquisition. Only improvement I can think of is to have voice feature to help alert on turns if used for car/road navigation.
5,One of the Best Books Ever.,This book was really good. Not only was it entertaining but it was educational too. It is one of the best historical ficion books I have every read. And by far the most entertaining.
5,my daughter loves everything Clifford,Another addition to our growing DVD collection....cant go wrong with anything Clifford! I love that the videos are long and provide multiple episodes.
1,"Mag card received, Turns on great-","Magnify power of lens very good, but Light will not shut off; the very cheap plastic button will not retract from the case body. A waste."
5,Wellhaven Credit Card Magnifier with light,"This product is outstanding. It is sturdy, the light is very bright and the magnification is excellent. I carry mine with me at all times. I received mine as a gift and have bought 4 since then for gifts to friends."
1,Not at all suited to the task.,"I had carried an OWL magnifier in my wallet for several years. It7 finally became so scratched and bruised that I needed a substitute.The Carson is not comparable to the OWL.It is much thicker than the OWL, about the same as two or three credit cards. It will fit in your wallet, but it will be like adding two or three credit cards. You'll feel the weight of this one as well. It's just a few ounces, but it is a noticeable weight in your pocket, purse or hand.It is absolutely NOT a 3x power magnifier. Maybe 1.5x on a good day. And the lens has so much distortion that it is practically unusable for reading.Finally, as others have noted, when you press the switch to turn on the light, the light stays on. Repeated pressing does not turn the light off. I finally tried a reasonably sharp rap on a flat surface: that worked.I am not pleased and will be returning this product.Jerry"
3,Don't go with this flex system,"The flex system sounds good, but the way the net connects to the poles is poorly designed and breaks easily, also difficult to get the net parallel on both sides. Go with a better quality volleyball set if you want the flex system."
5,Utterly charming and hilariously fascinating!,"I have just finished this Kristine Grayson novel and if you love the idea that magical myths throughout history might indeed be real, you'll love this book. I laughed aloud at the lawyer, Nora, who would accept what her eyes saw and deal with all such magic incidents from her legal mind's point of view. And the leading man, whoah, the only thing I would have changed would be more descriptive .... nah, each reader's imagination should supply her own romantic magic for a man we only wish we could conjur up!"
1,Utterly Discharmed,"I was excited about reading this book, thinking the book sounded very cute. Well, I was wrong. I didn't get a true since of the characters, none of them. But I know how the food taste to everyone, what they did in their bedroom, and so on. This would be a better book if the author cut down on description, do we really need to know what the Sea Bass Nora has for lunch taste like, and focus more on the charcters. So if you have a lot a free time and do not care what if a book is good or not, then go ahead and enjoy it."
4,Whitmore the ska punk duo,I bought this album after hearing the track alsion on p-rock t.v which is still probably my personel best. But here is a list of the tracks and a rating out of 5Alison 5 classic old school punk rock witha EXTREMELY catchy tune that you cannot forget and won't forget.Scones 3.5 O.k quite short could be improved the tune will seem recognizable but you will not be able to point out where fromOn the Ceiling 4.5 The p-rock theme tune great intro poor lyrics but hey they fit into the song29 times 4 Good but very forgetableJohnny Bells Greenhouse 5 Great tune is perfect lyrics are good.Star thing 3.5 O.kThe rest of the tracks are all the same so i cannot rate them but lets just say is you hate punk then never even think about buying this album
1,"Britney is ""OUTRAGEOUSLY"" stupid",Ok Britney. You display nothing but sex in all your concerts and videos but that isn't enough. Now you have to go and sing a song all about sex. THAT's OUTRAGEOUS!
4,Not bad!,"I've been trying to match up my driving lights with the super-white headlights on my CLK500 because the factory ones have that ""yellowish"" look. I've very pleased with these 70W bulbs. They have a blueish tint (similar to HID) and look much nicer with the headlights. I was also a bit fearful of using 70W when the manual calls for 55W after reading some horror stories about harnesses burning up on some cars when 100W were used. I've had these in for a few weeks and I'm very pleased."
1,Piece of junk!,"You'll need fingers the size of an infant with the dexterity of a neurosurgeon to attach the casters to the base. That is, of course, that the nuts actually fit the bolt, which some didn't. I had to get nuts to replace the ones that came with the product. I spent over an hour trying to use the worthless wrenches that were sent to do the assembly. A simple snap-in socket for the casters would make this an acceptable product."
4,Great Buy!!!,"You have to buy this computer, it performs very good, use it for gaming or work, this is te best computer for the money, one thing bothered me though, the OS is very slow to boot up every thing else is great!!"
4,Both very good and very mediocre.,"From browsing on the net, I knew that many experts had problems with the factual basis for Keys' theory. What I was surprised at was that in many cases the connections between cause and effect was weak, even accepting all Key's facts. I am thinking, for example, of his treatment of China and Korea. I found the discussion of the fall of the Roman/Byzantine empires to be longer than it needed to be, too much like a conventional history. Treatment of other subjects was very interesting, exemplified by his discussion of the British isles. The history was mostly new to me, and without unnecessary detail; Keys' theory as to why the Celtic west was more devastated by plague than the Anglo/Saxon east, tipping the balance of power, seemed to make a lot of sense."
2,Historical Ineptitude,"David Keys is more a storyteller than a historian. While his prose is simple and engaing, it is deployed to cover up several gaping holes in the evidence he uses. The number of other interpretaions of tree ring and ice core evidence are completley ignored (it is suspected thay only reflect local, and not necessarily climatic, conditions), casting the existance of ANY disaster at all into doubt. His use of textual evidence is fraught with supposition, all his chronicles and myths lacking all historical credibility. particilarly with the chinese texts, his technique of calling events important because of their statistical relevance is devoid of any qualative element.Even if it is conceded that a lack of credible evidence does not actually make Key's inpossible, his mingling of fact and fiction is manipulative and decieving. He KNOWS a little, but pretends to know a lot. This patronising, narrow, un-self-critical method is inadequate in an accademic historical context."
4,I'm putting this one thru the test,"A great theory... back with investigative technique, doesn't really appear to be revisionist... yet... Remember it is a theory. But it's a great theory and really got me thinking (like all great theories do).Read it... if you ever get the chance... PBS did a show on it... which is how I got exposed to this idea."
2,THe Strangest book,For school this summer one of our assingments was to read a book by Chris Lynch. I chose this cause it looked cool but it was the strangest thing I've ever read. I think my teacher's gonna be suprised when he reads my book repors
3,Decent reference for type treatments,"But if you are a newbie at photoshop you'll probably find yourself mindlessly following the concise step-by-step instructions without really learning how the sometimes complicated procedures produce their type magic. In such instances you may be better served by websites such as actionfx.com, which allow you to produce some truly jaw-dropping effects in seconds."
5,All Aboard!,"It's good-bye to an old friend and hello to a new one in the biggest adventure of Ash's life! When Professor Oak sends Ash on a mission to the Orange Islands, surprises await the young Pokemon trainer at every turn. One member of Ash's team will say good-bye forever, maybe. A stranger will join the posse. But who is he really? And a gentle new Pokemon called Lapras is discovered-only it may perish without Ash's help. The first of the three new exciting adventures on the Orangle Islands!!!"
1,Don't bye!,"Don't bye thees. They don't look like orginals. They are really small, so it looks like glasses for children!!It's just waste of money"
3,Overwrought,"This author obviously has an agenda. He attaches way too much intelligence to 'conspirators', as if they were the devil incarnate. While a lot of the information and the quotes were interesting, the overwrought tone of the book diminishes its value in my eyes. He borders on sounding like he's raving.The part about future bank runs was hilarious. How many people keep significant amounts of savings in a bank any longer? How many Americans actually have any savings? A bank run in the 21st century? Ridiculous!"
5,The Truth is Not Always Comfortable,"Griffin has done a bang-up job of research and presentation of this topic. So much so that it very easily could create a sinking feeling in the readers stomach to think that our country has been co-opted by the world banking cabal into a source of ""energy"" analogus to what happened to the ""citizens"" in the first Matrix movie.We are fed all these blue-sky rosie pictures of our country from grade school through college and now someone is telling us that we've been hoodwinked. Sure, his book is full of conspiracies. But they are only conspiracies until proven to be fact! This should be required reading for anyone NOT wishing to be a tool of the Matrix!"
5,Learn about the creature,"The book is very substantial and goes into the history of money, currency, banking, and central banking. It jumps around chronologically, and is somewhat difficult to follow. Lot's of conspiratorial overtones may turn people off of an otherwise compelling call to end the Fed. It's shortfalls notwithstanding, I believe this is a book every American should read, as there is no other institution that can so directly affect everyone's lives."
4,Overall A Good (but windy) Read,"Griffin exposes the basic workings of the Fed...eventually...in layman's terms. He also spattered some interesting political history into the mix yet never quite frames it all.My only displeasure is his ""gold bug"" solution, viz, he fails to address how a commodity-based currency can be detached from its inherent (numismatic) value to avoid distortions of real wealth. He ducks the issue by saying that mining precious metals would be as much work, or as valuable, as other endeavors. Griffin also glosses over the logistical nightmare of implementing commodity money such as hoarding, validating certificates, etc. which could give us bigger crooks even than the Fed and its money-changer cartelists."
4,Golf Ball spinner,This particular product Check go sweet spot finder replaced my Dave Petz golf ball spinner that I gave to someone else. For the quality and price I paid for Check go sweet spot finder you really can't beat it. My old spinner was a little more heavy duty but you have pay $10 plus extra for it!! Since you're only using the machine 1-2 a month to mark golf balls it great deal
1,Sorry Excuse For Space,"Thinking I would learn something, I quickly found out that this was a total waste of time let alone the paper and ink used to produce it with. Mr. Bartran better do something other than author."
2,"Interesting Plot Line, Poor Execution","This is appareently the first novel by Kevin Grover, a former Army Non-Com. Certainly his experience in the Army would have provided may interesting ideas for a novel, and this must be one of them. Too bad he didn't meet any interesting people in the Army. At least it appears from his characters in Strike Hard that everyone in the Army is dull, listless, and without emotion. Either that or they are all afraid to speak their mind, and are still tied to their mother's apron strings, just like the characters in Strike Hard. This is a book for guys that just want to be friends with women.Despite an interesting plot line, this book was hard to read, and hard to follow. While there were some hints of solid writing, the book was overall pretty boring."
2,not enough detail,"I bought this book because it promised to give detailed information on many things, but in fact the chapter on setting up a PPP server was woeful. I couldn't even find out how to setup a getty from here."
3,"average thriller, starts well but gradually declines","Starting with The Letter of the Law (followed by The Fourth Perimeter and now The Fifth Angel), Green has written three pretty decent legal/law enforcement thrillers following his earlier novels based on NFL athletes. Each starts off well enough, with a sort of unique or at least interesting premise, but then either meanders along or steadily declines through the end. In The Fifth Angel, Jack Ruskin is a down-and-out guy who manages to balance a successful career by day and a dangerous hobby by night - that hobby is selecting random child sex offenders and eliminating them. The novel loses its steam as it brings Ruskin and a female FBI agent/profiler to a predictable rendezvous in a rather disappointing conclusion."
5,WOW!,Don't start this one unless you have time to finish it because you will not be able to put it down.....it really makes you think...what would I do? Excellent read!
5,A New Favorite Author for Me,"This is the first book I have read from this author, but will look for more of the same. It was a well written, sweet, funny look at something we all need to believe in. I had just lost my husband and was flying home (first time on a plane). Picked this up in the airport and was immediately immersed in the story, so forgot to be nervous about my flight. It was something I could connect to in my fragil state so thank you Debbie Mcomber for some light at the end of my particular tunnel."
3,"Not User-Friendly, But Has Unusual Information","I agree with those reviewers who contend that the book does not explain things step by step, nor give many worked examples. Still, it gives information that is seldom presented in engineering books. For instance, it shows, in some detail, how membrane theory works in engineering. A section on curved beams shows how irregular cross-sections can be ""sliced up"" into sections, and then the sections can be summated instead of doing numerical integration.Other topics discuss subjects such as virtual work, beam on Winkler foundation, beams with wide flanges, Saint-Venant's torsion, beams subject to unsymmetric bending, shear center and shear flow, etc."
2,Skips too many steps,"As a university professor, I chose this book for a graduate course because it seemed to cover the same topics that I wanted to cover.Unfortunately, after using it for a semester, I've found that the book always skips the key steps in a derivation. Often, it is only evident to the reader that steps have been skipped from the cryptic language used by the authors: ""Using equilibrium and compatibility, the following expression results"". Very important information is left out.The book is so short on detail that it would be better if the authors simply published a stack of formulas."
2,Better out there for the same material and lower cost,"Material covered in this book is standard, but I agree with other reviewers that the binding is terrible and there is no solutions manual. I like to think I take excellent care of my books, but several pages have separated from the spine of my book after less than a semester of use.Advanced Mechanics of Materials by Boresi and Schmidt has better binding, a solutions manual, and costs less than this book while offering the same material."
1,Worst DVD ever,"This DVD did not serve the purpose it was intended for. It fails as an instructional tool no matter what level you are on. If you are a beginner, you will be really dissapointed as this video does not address some of the basic rules of dancing, it is not very detail, and it does not guide you step by step. For those who have some kind of dancing knowledge, you will also find it dissapointing because the moves taught on the video are really basic and not very attractive."
3,Okay not Adrienne's best work,"Anne is mistaken for her beautiful sister Nicole, whom the Earl thinks is a gold digger and has set sights on his nephew's fortune.He soon realized his mistake and fell in love with Anne himself.There is not much to the storyline, there was no justifiable reason for me, for the Earl to automatically assume Nicole Anne's sister was out for his nephew's fortune, having never met her, plus his plan to compromise her to ruin her reputation and make her unfit for his nephew was really far fetched.All in all although it was not a page turner and it wasn't a really bad novel, it just fell very short of being a good book."
2,There's no need to...,"Greetings Everyone!Ijust bought the new Turilli's Album. I can't understand why does Luca make so much albums in very short period of time... Ok, the guy is great, he has an amazing sense of melody and a vast imagination but Luca! Have a break!!! This Album sounds Tired, Uninspired... How can i tell you... It's boring! We wll know how great commposer you're, give us great albums like the first Rhapsody's or the amazing two albums from you as solist... I can wait for a very Turilli Album, there's no need to rush! Sincerily Juan Pablo"
4,Blues influenced with a strong folk bent,"DELTA SNAKE BLUES NEWSEditor/Publisher: Al Handa No. 19These guys have created an interesting sound that combines the blues with 60's folk elements, and a delta blues player's sense of rhythm. They intersperse that with pure folk that doesn't have the feel of a minor work, and has a sense of mystery and distance, which at times gives me the feeling that some years from now I'll think some of this will be a classic at least in some sense. One hopes a band like this will be given a chance to see if this is true."
5,An Oldie but Goodie,This was a text book for my kiddy lit class. It is full of good applicable info.
3,Very bad graphics,I bought this secrets can kill game and I started to like it but the garphics were very poor.That was the only game that i have played witth bad graphics.My sister said they had bad graphics too.I was in the middle of the game(i think?)when i was going to talk to people and the y didn`t wabt to talk to me.I went to Maxines diner and Darl Grey would nit talk to me.I don`t know what too do.It is a very hard game in master and senior.I don`t like it.
3,Could have been a bit better for me!,I liked this book but I wanted to love it. The story idea was great and I feel like the author could've really done some interesting things with the quirky characters in the big red house. It's difficult to put my finger on just what the book was lacking but I honestly felt like it was a bit slow - just my opinion!
2,"Sorry folks, it bit.","I ordered this book because I loved ""Into the Forest"" by Jean Hegland and was steered to this title. I was so disappointed. He writes like a Junior College Creative Writing student. The characters are all one-sided and the story builds to mediocre climax after mediocre climax. Save your money on this one."
3,Silly!,"This story is preposterous. I enjoyed Mr. Kleiner's writing and this is a fair first effort, but the story is totally outrageous and unbelievable to the point of not being fun or funny. It's obvious that the author is very young indeed."
1,Didn't know this was a live performance CD!,"Unfortunatly, when I ordered this CD, there was nothing indicating in the description that this was a live perfomance CD. I based my choice on the selection of songs and was a bit surprised when I found out it was live. There is nothing more annoying than to hear a singer out of breath, interacting with the audience and having to listen to the audience sing along. If you don't like live performance CD's, stay away from this one."
5,Nice,One of my favorites. Some of their original compositions are really nice when they break out a bit from the standard salsa structure into lyrical or jazz progressions. Hot.
5,A great resource!,"I have to confess right up front that I have a ""thing"" for names. Therefore, I own lots and lots of ""name your baby"" books. For naming your Jewish baby, this book is the best! The list of names is extensive with lots of uncommon (here in the States) choices. The book provides the Hebrew spelling as well as the English spelling. There also is a rating system showing the name's popularity in the U.S. and in Israel. If you're looking for a name for your Jewish baby and you want to go beyond the usual Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, Rachel, Jacob, etc., you need this book!"
5,atonal vs. twelve-tone,"I would just like to point out (in contrast to what a few reviews have implied) that while Pierrot Lunaire is ""atonal"" (not in a conventional key) it is not twelve-tone. Schoenberg did not begin using the twelve-tone system until later in his life.These songs are incredibly beautiful, and not particularly ""hard to listen to"". Even if you generally disliked Schoenberg keep in mind that Pierrot is quite different from some of his later works. And don't be put off if you think you don't understand it. Just keep an open mind and enjoy the extraordinary sound Schoenberg has created."
3,Come on it's got the word 'zombie' in the title!,"The guy above me is telling the truth. Still a great flick! The 'head scene' is hilarious and I could tell that the folks behind this film really gave it their all for what they had to work with. If your vhs copy is good just stick with it for now. This disk has slightly poor quality, but hey, it's on disk man!!! Oh...one more thing, the futuristic background in this low budget flick is pretty impressive."
3,Worth Checking Out,"They played this album on college radio here in Atlanta alot. It turned headz for a minute, but stayed on the underground. Lyrics are cool, but there are some nasty abstract beats on this cd. Production was done byStraight Roots Productions an Atlanta production duo that moved to Miami in the late 90's. The Sleestakz were the first non-Miami bass group to be signed to the now defunct Atlanta based Ichiban label. Give the cd a listen Kings of Kaos, Crystal Clear, the jeep beater Behind The Iron Curtain are some of my favorites.True School Hip-Hop Headz United."
4,This album is PHAT!,"I purchased the Sleestack'z album at my local record store because it was creating a buzz in my neighborhood (East New York, Jamiaca Ave.). I was skeptical, being that it basically was an independent release. But I was BLOWN away. The lyrics are TIGHT. The beats are PHAT. There are four very diverse members in the group, each with his own diverse style. There's Nailz, a metaphoric MC with much flow. Then there's Oxx, a Puerto Rican MC who reveals the facts behind what people most percieve as reality. There's Nic the Nobody, an MC whose lyrical flow is on par with the best of the free flowin' greats (Nas, Big Pun, etc.). But what sets him apart from the rest, is the variety of point of views he takes in his rhymes. Finally, there's Dwella, the MC who can take you on a journey around the world (& back) in a single verse. Individually, each one of these MC's can hold their own, but together, they create an extaordinary blend of SLEESTACK'z."
1,Battery tester,This tester is not easily used. You have to make sure the battery is inserted in exactly the right method otherwise it has a no read which you don't know if it is a dead battery or bad reading. I would not purchase this version again.
1,Pamela's Gluten Free Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip Cookies,The cookies are crisp and tasty but every batch ordered arrived in crumbs and were totally inedible as cookies and had to be used as pudding or ice cream toppings.
5,A perfect case for my Sony Cyber-shot H20,"I received your case in the mail promptly, and was delighted with its condition, which was new. The case itself has several compartments for extra battery, and memory stick...its best feature is the way the camera fits perfectly into the larger zippered compartment - when you put your straps around your shoulder the entire case fits well and is designed for balance. Thank you for the condition and for an excellent product!"
3,Too big for the new Sony cameras,"This is a great little case if you are looking for something to hold more than just the camera. It says ""Sony CyberShot"" on it, but we were looking for something small to protect our new Sony Cybershot DSCW70 camera, and find this is big enough to hold 2 or 3 of them."
2,Way tooooo big!!!,This case is way toooo big for the Sony DSC-N2 camera. What were they thinking? I can fit three cameras into the case!
4,worthwhile addition for the Sony digicam,Should have with the camera when you don't have any place else to put it.
3,Sony LCS-CSD General Carrying Case for Compatible Cybershot Digital Cameras,"The product is fine. However, there is not much room on the USB cord. The design is just satisfactory.Thanks!"
2,Nice bag for small Cybershot models,"This bag is well made and of good quality. However, it does not fit my needs. While I do have a Sony cybershot, it is not the small model that would fit inside this bag. This is the bag that was recommended, but it does not accommodate my model of camera. I have a Sony Cybershot, but it is a larger, professional style camera with a Carl Zeiss lens, wide angle, etc. This bag is simply too small for that."
2,A Goldberg without a cause,"Schiff tries hard to deal with the Goldberg, but his lightfooted (a bit wimpy) style falls short. It sounds thin and a bit lost. This becomes apparent when listening to other interpretations, such as Glenn Gould's 1955 breakthrough recording (arguable the best ever), or Vladimir Feltsman's ornamented version. Unless you already have Gould or Feltsman - I can't recommend Schiff for the Goldberg.Schiff does a much better job with some of his other Bach recordings, such as his French Suites - a 5-star recording that kicks butt!"
1,this is not the 24 x 48 door it is the 8 x 8,"I ordered this thinking I was going to get a 2' by 4' access door, what was shipped was a 8"" by 8"" door."
2,Hmmmmm,"Don't own this book. Don't want to. Some good rituals/spells to be found in here but 'Mama Silver' really lost her tenuous grip on my attention with this one. Didn't finish the book first time around, had to get it out of the local library twice (that this was possible shows that not too many of the local Witches enjoyed it). Not worth the huge price tag, but not too bad out of the library.Blessings."
1,Not for Novices?,Someone wrote it is not a book for novices. That is hysterically funny. Obviously another kid thinks these books are for real. It's an interesting book but it's F I C T I O N . Even the writer knows that. Why do writers write books? Get a grip on reality.
5,"An excellent, humorous romp.","William Marsano has collected an amazing array of humorous newspaper accounts. From the woman who really wanted to rid her trailer of cockroaches, to the man who died beneath an avalanche of potatoes. If you enjoy dark humor, this collection is for you. Try your best to track down this book."
4,library book,"tired of the library books with all the stickers, they should at least take off that ridiculous laminated wrapping stuff"
3,If you want just NOISE . . .,"Yeah, not the best thing Dano's ever put out, but they do have other distortion pedals. This one just gives you a nasty boost of noise which is helpful if you dig the feedback effects created when combined with other pedals. Used JUST by itself it sounds just like noise, BUT you can control the tone of the noise which is good for your more experimental/industrial/Noise rock stuff, it's good to keep in your arsenal as just a few more knobs to twist around to get weird sounds. Personally, I love it for many of the reasons other people Hate it, but whatever."
4,Promising Cinema,Impressive movie with wonderfull performance of the young leading actor. Beautifully visualized in a poetic and convincing style. Promising cinema of this Dutch director.
1,Homophobic rubbish! - The worst possible rating,"I usually make an effort to catch any gay themed movies that come my way, but in the case of this film I'm very sorry I wasted the 50 minutes or so watching it. Don't waste your time with this homophobic piece of rubbish. Watch Beautiful Thing for a much more positive depiction of how a young man comes to terms with being gay."
3,Maybe too expensive to buy,"After watching the ending, I understood why this very short film was controversial. Almost unnecessarily depressing and maybe offensive."
2,Keep looking...there's better N.E. Driving Tour books,"Very poor maps, very little information on some of the larger cities in N.E. This book is one big ad for pie shops, antiques and museums. Nothing about nightlife, hiking or even great photo opportunities. I wish I could get my money back."
4,Nick Swardson: Who Farted?,"Very funny! Always looking for good standup. Nick Swardson's ""who farted"" is a hilarious classic and I am looking forward to another one hour Dvd special from this comedian."
2,Give me Terry from Reno 911,"Gotta say I was disappointed with the performance. Nick Swardson was absolutely hilarious on ""Reno 911"" as Terry the homosexual skater. He does that voice once in the show for a short bit, no doubt trying to placate those there to see just that guy. But he efforts away from it with some not quite memorable routines that don't really seem to have any kind of staying power.I have seen and listened to a bunch of comedians. This routine was flat. I laughed out loud once. The rest of the time, the best I got was a smile here or there. Pedestrian. Worthy of a local comic at the comedy club."
4,Worth a read,"While not the best Holmes pastiche that I've read, The Star of India still deserves an honorable mention. It has its share of suspense and Holme's deductive powers. The language and flow of the story is quite different that that of the original canon, and it could be quite distracting.I would reccommend giving this a read, although it could use some work. I hope that Ms.Bugge writes more Holmes pastiches, because this one was quite enjoyable."
4,The Truth and The Legend,"A wonderful read.The history of the pony express was fairly brief; for only about a year and a half did it do business. Author Corbett chooses to give this short history a sufficient writing, thankfully not stretching it past the point to which we would care. He then spends the rest of the book (over half of it, actually) exploring those who kept the legend alive and profited from it. Corbett does a stellar job of allowing the reader to enjoy each story (even when he's about to prove it to be bunk) and he gives the famous, infamous, and totally forgotten their due. Overall, Mr. Corbett has created a very good book about one of U. S. history's more interesting sidenotes."
3,Okay...,I thought this book was just okay. I bought it for a friend to share with her kids. The illustrations are all kind of dark and scary for young children.
2,vibration feature stopped working after only a week!,"I really do love this bassinet but the vibration feature stopped working after only a week of use! This was my daughter's favorite feature so needless to say i was pretty disappointed. I do like the other features of the bassinet. However, I have never used the changing table or the bed side sleeper."
5,It's worth every penny spent!,"We appreciated this easy-to-assemble product, which took one personless than half an hour to put together. It is very versatile and can be used for a girl or a boy. We liked the nightlight rdature, which offered a handy way to keep baby's sleeping area gently lit. The soothing lullabies, nature sounds and vibrations helped to lull my little one to sleep. I could rock my son back to sleep not only without getting up,but even without as much as lifting my head from the pillow. And when I wanted to get some more uninterrupted sleep in the morning, my husband was able to take him in the Portable Sleeper to another room.This sleeping system is one of the best available on the market today.It's worth every penny spent!"
4,5-in-1 Bassinet,"For the amount of money, this bassinet is great! It has a ton of amenities to use. It is great how the bassinet pulls apart from the changing area and the basket underneath for storage comes in handy. The only thing I would improve would be the wheels. I only have carpet and for me, it does not roll smoothly on my carpet. However, the wheels are not keeping me from loving the rest of it. It is a keeper!"
2,Nice features - but our sound system didn't work,"Just like another reviewer noted, we received this package that had already been opened and returned. Therefore, after we put it together, we tested the vibration/sound/light features and they didn't work. How terrible that BabiesRus would put this defect back on the shelf.I'm also concerned about the stability of the sleep system as the bassinet just rests inside the changing table. Seems odd. Cheap flimsy mattress. We will be getting another if we keep this unit. We are waiting for the Manufacturer to respond to our request for another sound/light unit. If they don't send one, we'll send it back and purchase something else. Shame on BabiesRus."
3,"Like it, don't love it","I purchased this bassinet for our 2nd child - we did not have one for our first and I had regretted it. This bassinet works well and I love that I can take it along with me from room to room. It is also sturdy and I don't have any concerns about safety. I am dissapointed that there is not an option to keep the music/light/vibrations on as long as you like...the light does not stay on long enough for a night time feeding. Also, the adjustable legs do not go low enough for the bedside sleeper to work properly - I can scoot it right next to me, but cannot attach it to our bed - which is a normal height. I have not used the diaper changer since the actual bassinet has to be removed to get to it. Overall, it's a good product, but did not live up to it's description 100%,"
3,"Patchy, with some fine moments","The lively tracks fare best here. There is a lot to like about those particular tracks and the period tongue (loov instead of love, coom instead of come, etc) is not nearly as cumbersome as it might have been, due to the convincing performances of the singers.However, the slower numbers are often, in my opinion, rather sour.Having heard this disc several times, it strikes me that it becomes less attractive over time, with the novelty of the approach soon wearing thin.Still, some tracks are very lively and the artists are obviously having fun bringing a rather unique angle to these pieces, so it might well appeal to those who like something unusual.Recording quality is fine, though the final fade-out is clumsily managed."
5,Very informative with a ton of in depth information,Love this book. It reviews some pathophysiology and has definitely given me some useful concepts to bring into acute care. There are not a ton of pictures. I love that it includes how to troubleshoot equipment. This book is a must!
3,JUST LIKE THE GENESIS VERSION...ALMOST,"As far as the graphics go,this game looks just like the Genesis version.The only diffrences compared to the Genesis cart,is the Sega CD version has some more options in the cheat menu,you don't need the blood code to get the blood,there's a few more animations,Sub-Zero's stance is fixed and does not look like a blue Scorpion,there's a MK commerical video at the start of the game and the disc load times.Other than that,it looks and plays just like the Genesis game.It's no where near the arcade version.It's still a good game though.If you want a decent arcade version of MK 1,get one of the plug n play games or get the two disc Mortal Kombat:Deception Premium Pack that includes an arcade version of Mortal Kombat 1."
3,great game for its time,I bought this game years after sega cd died and I thouhgt it was ok. It is just liek the arcade version and the videos in the game are awful. But lucky the game is exactly like the classic mk.. So if you like the first mk on the arcade you will love the game play on this one. But just to warn you the video quality in this is awful and the sound sometimes can be too.
3,For Beginners,"This book has many of the tutorials that came with Photoshop 5. The only good thing about it, is that you can view the tutorials in a much more detailed way. The CD has nothing. If you know how to work with channels and layers, look somewhere else."
3,It's okay,"This book is okay, however, it doesn't do a great job of explaining the ""whys"" of what it has you doing. In a couple of different places it just spits out commands and doesn't tell you why you're doing it.Furthermore, there are examples that just don't work, I've gotten most of them to work through trial & error. Luckily, I've already invested quite a bit of time with Photoshop, so I've learned how to do some of the stuff on my own, I just expected a lot more from the book..."
2,Not What I expeceted,Only played the DVD once have not played it again since then. Too Hard to follow maybe I should take a class.
1,The Worst,"Putting scent aside, this candle was an absolute joke. Out of the box, its initial light stayed lit for 20 minutes before dying out. After continually scooping out wax and giving this candle several opportunities to burn again, it never stayed lit for more than 20 minutes. Very frustrating. As a candle enthusiast, I will never buy from this company again. Was the candle I bought just an anomaly with a defective wick? Maybe, maybe not. I personally will never know unless someone sends me one free."
2,Try another brand,I bought three of these candle based on reviews from other Customers. I love the Diptyque line of candles from John Galliano but the $60.00 cost is prohibitive. My fault....bought them without smelling them first. Not a fan of the scent since it came across as more perfume like then previous reviews had stated. My biggest complaint is that I can't keep the Wickes to lit and have to through them away.
2,Unplayable Lie!,The only thing that got me through this book was the fact that I've played both Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill.
3,"Too Costly, can get the same tea for $7.00 at any grocery store","You can get the same Tea at most of the Asian Groceries at around 7 dollars. The tea is good, but at $18, its a rip off."
5,very good,"We have bought it now 3-4 times from amazon and enjoy it everytime we buy it. If you like really strong tea, this brand will be my number one recommendation to you. Shipping and pricing is amazingly great."
5,Great Introductory Work,"The book, Meditation, is a good introduction both to meditation and to Osho's works in digital, print, audio and video formats.Having already read and admired The Book of Secrets (112 ancient meditation techniques with commentary by Osho), I can say that The Book of Secrets may be difficult for some without some background reading, and the book Meditation is the right place to begin before reading and studying The Book of Secrets.The book, Meditation, includes the modern active techniques by Osho as well as other materials to provide a thorough overview for the beginner, re-beginner and long-time meditator. Peace."
5,Wonderful book,"Osho's ideology is one of the hundreds mythical ideologies which exist in our world. In this ideology osho puts each man instead of God and he tries to define the completed and highly spiritual soul as a god. To become a perfect soul, you should love unconditionally and thoroughly. He thinks of mind as a big obstacle for your faith. You should put your mind aside so that you could start meditation."
4,More than a book on just meditation.,"This is a book on life and the trivialities we tend to focus on as much as its about meditation.Profound and deeply inspiring and thought provoking.I wanted to pick up all of oshos books after this one.The star i take away is because some of the meditation techniques are a bit tedious and impractical, some techniques are altered to suit the modern age man, which lacks authenticity and character.Other than these few techniques, its a fabulous read and very recommended."
2,Bumbling fumbling,The Dippy Blonde has more brains than our uncles. The story about a zombie is so silly El Supremo's pet chimp is the smartest of everyone. Look over once then toss!
1,Not Useful,"While this book may be appropriate for University level students, it is out-of date with respect to the coding languages used and the coding examples only make sense if you get the floppy that is supposed to come with the book and which did not come with the book I ordered. For me, this was a total waste of money. However, for a older grad student who knows Fortran this may be the ticket."
5,Great Story for a good readers,"I think this book is a very nice transitional book from simple chapter books into more complex books. My 8-yr old daughter, who is a very good reader, did expand her vocabulary the use of bigger and more complex words. If you love dog stories, you'll like this one too."
3,My son loves McGrowl books,"This book isn't going to be a classic, but it is fun to read. I have a young son who loves language and we read this book when he was in Kindergarten. Now each time there is another McGrowl book available through a school book fair, he adds it to his collection. We don't have any pets, but he loves the silliness of a bionic dog. The plotlines are ridiculous, but it sparks his imagination and he gets tickled each time we read about Thomas, Violet and McGrowl. If your child likes to think outside the box, he or she will probably enjoy this book and dream up their own adventures about having such a dog."
1,"It's better than ""This Present Wasteland""...","...but that's not saying much. The title track is the best. It just goes downhill from there. I wanted to like it, but I could not, no matter how much I wanted to. Suggestion to Metal Church: get rid of Ronnie Monroe and replace him with somebody who can actually sing. OK, he can technically sing, but not well. The final track ""Watch The Children Pray"" shows how woefully inferior he is to David Wayne who died much too young. The 1986 version recorded on ""The Dark"" with David doing the vocals so powerfully is so vastly superior to this pathetic tribute that simply doesn't do him justice."
4,A Pleasant Surprise Indeed!,"Sadly with the passing of David Wayne in May 2005, Metal Church lost one of it's strengths as Wayne's vocal delivery was unique and very strong.The new line up consisting of Kurdt Vanderhoof (guitar), Ronny Munroe (vocals), Jay Reynolds (guitar), Steve Unger (bass) and new addition Jeff Plate are all in fine form here. Ronny Munroe has the ability to sound like Wayne at times, yet has the fortitude to establish his own voice as well. The group sounds tight and the tunes are well writen.The songs found on here are pretty much old school Church with tracks number 4 and 5 being especially awesome! This my friends is indeed a good thing as those first two releases were simply gold! The sound is up to date which is again cool as those older mixes from the first two cd's were a little thin for the most part.I'd say overall it's well worth the price of admission. If you liked Metal Church in 1985 and 86, you'll love this offering.Enjoy!"
2,Works ok,"Works ok with the telephoto lens kit, but given the opportunity I would have bought a better camera instead of this and the telephoto lens."
1,corny book,nothing about this book is remotely that interesting on a whole. i pretty much thought the book was just aight&it didn't tell me anything that i didn't already know. the Book was corny&very bland. the book wasn't uplifting&it didn't open my eyes to nothing.
3,Not that intense,"I thought that this would be a great workout. These girls go through extreme workouts to get amazing bodies! I was expecting a fun, upbeat, extreme dance workout. Maybe some routines, but definately a lot of cardio.Unfortunately, it was very low intensity, low beat, kind of boring. I was hoping to fast-forward through it to make it faster!But the girls have a great attitude in it. It is fun, but definately not a calorie burner!"
1,Calorie Blastting Dance...really?!,"When I saw that the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders had Calorie Blasting Dance video I was thrilled. I'm your averaged sized 27 year old woman who works out about 4-5 days a week and I love a good dance exercise video. I was seriously disappointed. After 15 minutes I turned it off. I hadn't even broken a sweat...and I break a sweat caring laundry up and down my stairs at home. I probably burned more calories getting ready to workout. It was THAT bad. The ""dance"" moves are not physically challenging. The cheerleaders are annoying. I'm sorry to say it, but I wouldn't recommend this video."
3,the lion king,it is good for children learning to read my nephew loves it and he is learning to read from it
3,not what it's all about,"while yes, this cd does have a good array of decent music, i think the cd itself flies in the face of the jamband scene. i don't understand how one can decide what should go on the cd and what shouldn't. i've never been a fan of ""best of"" cd's, and this is a perfect example. who's the guy that says norah jones should be chosen over disco biscuits?also, i had the awful feeling after i bought this disc that i'm supporting a profit-based organization rather than one that truly appreciates the music these artists produce. sure, the cd serves as a vector to open people's eyes to a different genre of music, but it's closing the gap between a jam band and a pop band. plus, 22 bucks?"
2,100% coverage in very general terms,"Test preparation in a VERY general sense. If I wanted a book that simply told me ""what I should know"" I could have written it with 30 pages in paperback. Don't let it's size fool you. Even its included tests are easy and nothing even close to that you'll get have on the exam. The material on the CD makes it look even better. But its just more vague material. This book is also not the detailed reference that you by with the smaller book."
3,"Passed the Exam using it as guide, but some errors","All in all, with the information in this book plus some hands-on experience, I was able to pass 70-270 without much problem. However, there are several misprints and inaccuracies in the text that I didn't find covered in the ""Errata"" section on the book's website.While I can't expect a book to be 100% error-free, there seemed to be more than just the ""slipped through the editorial cracks"" stuff. A non-technical editor possibly wouldn't have known that Remote Desktop runs on port 3389, instead of 3398, for example. The little ""gotchas"" in the book can be damaging on the exam if you don't thoroughly know the rest of the material well.Hey, I'm not complaining. I passed the test. :)"
5,"Riobaldo, a brother of Fausto and Dom Quixote","Guimares Rosa is a kind of brazilian James Joyce. The linguistic inovations and the marvelous saga of a simple/complex man called Riobaldo, makes this novel one of most important books of XX century. Like Fausto and other famous characters of world literature, Riobaldo is a man in doubt about life, love, God and Devil, death, friendship, always looking for the answers in the nature of the interior of Brazil. The book is a mixture of epic, drama, war and the language shows what Guimares Rosa was in life: a researcher of portuguese language and a studious of the human nature."
3,Not the right one.,I was trying to replace a vent in my bathroom. This item could not be used to the way the original vent was installed.
3,"Loud, but effective.","I think the sones rating might be incorrect... or it is for an uninstalled fan.When mounted per the instructions, the vibrations travel thru my rafters and joists and you can hear this fan all over the house. IF I ever have to do this job again, I would definitely use some sort of isolation mount (check any soundproofing sales site for these).The fan power, however, is great. The mirror is barely foggy at all when I step out of the shower."
4,More information/illustrations would be helpful.,"This bathroom ceiling fan is much quieter than the previous fan. I am pleased with the sound. However, I found that mounting the fan with the attached mount placed the exaust 180 degrees from the exaust ventpipe, already installed. If I had had access to the fan from the attic, this would not have been a problem; I would have installed a cross mount for positioning the fan correctly, lining up with the ventpipe. Also, the fan exaust was 4in. in diameter. The original was 3in."
2,BEADS FALL OFF STRING,"I WANT to love these lacing beads. We should be able to love these lacing beads! They are, after all Melissa and Doug, the toy brand that we all love. But I really dislike them.The strings have nothing to stop the beads from falling off. Even double knotting the end of the string does not keep the large beads from slipping.This is very frustrating for a three year old.We instead end up using this for sorting and patterns. Too bad we can't use it to 'lace'."
4,Lacing beads,"Bought this for my 3 year old who is finally showing interest in lacing.Pros: big, bright, colorful beads, 2 lacing strings included.Cons: box has no lid, I had to sand inside of beads (more than the manufacture did) so it wouldn't destroy the 2 laces.Overall we are happy with our purchase."
5,"Simple, fun toy","I bought these for my daughter to help her fine motor skills. Even though she is five, her fine motor skills are more like 3. These challenge her without being frustrating, and they provide lots of ways to practice sorting skills and making patterns, so she is still getting age-appropriate skills in other areas. Like all Melissa and Doug toys, they are high quality and stand up to what kids throw at them. Even the bead that was taken by my dog survived the experience with only a few battle scars."
3,Disappointing storage for Beads,"While the beads and laces are great for fine motor skills, the bigger disappointment in this product was that the box is not actually made for storage. It does not have a lid on it, so I had to put the whole kit in a ziploc bag. The company could have spent a little more on a nice plastic lid that would slide in and out of the box. It would have made it a much more enjoyable toy for parent and child alike."
5,very fun toy & imaginative,"I bought this for my daughter for her 4th birthday. She's always been into puzzles and creating designs using her other toys, so I thought this would be good for her. Turns out..she loves it!! Out of all the gifts she got, this is the one she spent hours playing with at the table. The next morning after her party she woke up and said ""Mommy, I want some cereal and my new puzzle game!!"" She does the designs on each board, it doesnt bother her at all that they dont ""stick"". She also creates her own designs as well. She made a really cool cobra snake (her words) out of the blue pieces. A great toy in my opinion!!"
3,No top?,"There is no top, which means that the hundreds of pieces really can't be transported in the box. Either a major over-site or a lame way to cut costs."
4,Between Excellent and Good,"I bought this one and MightyMind Regular Edition. My son loves both of them, he likes this one to make the said puzzle and then he would make his own design my keeping all the blocks in his way.Between this one and MightyMinds Regular Edition, I would rate mightyminds higher since it has the potential to be used for a longer time because of its difficulty but this one is surely durable since it is made of wooden pieces and MM Reg Ed is made out of paper and cardboard.This one will also keep your little one occupied for hours together and he /she is sure to enjoy it(IF THEY LIKE PLAYING WITH BLOCKS)Cheers......n'joy....."
2,not enough boards,I am going to have to buy some additional blocks and boards because there isn't enough boards with patterns on them. I am really shocked.
3,Good toy but needs better storage solution,"The puzzle is great, it is well described... wooden puzzle, the child is supposed to match the figures in the pattern with the puzzle pieces.BUT for the price they should have thrown in a lid to keep the puzzle pieces in the box, puzzle pieces will be all over your house unless you get another box to store it. What's the point of adding the manufacturing cost of the wooden box if you cannot use it???"
3,Can be frustrating.,"I usually love Melissa & Doug toys, but this puzzle was a little disappointing. Although, I love the concept and the educational value of it, it can be pretty frustrating. The pieces do not stay in place. You put one piece in, and the rest of them slide out of place. This puzzle would, probably, be better if the pieces were magnetic. So unless you are planning on getting rid of the picture boards, like one of the reviews recommends, try looking for something better."
4,"great, but not necessarily the most exciting toy for kids","This is a great toy, good quality, eductational etc. I can't say that it is a barrel of laughs, so if you are a granparent or aunt looking to spoil your little relatives opt for something a little more awe inducing, but if you are a parent looking for something that is fun and educational, this is a good option."
2,"Good looking toy, difficult to play","This is a nice, colorful toy, but when it comes to play, it does not work so well. The blocks do not stay on the pattern and slides away with slightest shake, so kid has to be very cautious when placing them. Apart from that, the blocks are really good and my son loves playing just wih different shapes and placing them on floor. It would have been nice if board had some grove or sticky pad on which blocks can be placed."
1,The worst battery I never Had,I bought a DSC-P100 and in normal condition the battery is no longer than tree months.Now I have to pay US$ 45.00 for a new one.
3,Young Readers,This is a good book for a pre-teen reader to help them understand the 1918 Flu Pandemic.
5,A guide that nornlizes life for HSP,I am extremely grateful for finding the HSP Survival Guide. The book has given me a fresh prespective on life and clarified my sensitivties and strengths. I now realize that I am a normal person in a highly fast and stimulating world .I am an HSP.Thank you Dr. Ted Zeff.
4,Practical and Useful Advice for HSPs,"I found this book to have useful, practical advice for HSPs. I was especially excited to see the information on meditation, including mindfulness meditation. The chapter on surviving in the workplace was also good. As for ""namby pamby"" advice; I guess what the author is trying to get across is that HSPs need to stand up for themselves and let others know when they are being bothered (within reason)."
3,There are others like you and me!,"I thought I was the only person who got overwhelmed (moreso than many) by sudden loud noises, seeing someone else in physical or emotional pain, witnessing violence in a movie, holding an old object in an antique store. It takes me more time to recover than most people I know, and I kind of am very permeable to it and I get super-affected. If someone has called you oversensitive consider yourself lucky. You are blessed with the gift of being hypersensitive and it is necessary for artists so be grateful you have that ability to tap into feeling. While at times it is painful this book opened my eyes to whom I am and helped me realize I'm not alone and most likely neither are you."
1,Not Water Resistant.,"This watch is supposedly water resistant up to 99 meters...It's not.By day 2, the inside of the watch was already fogging up from the water it would encounter when my 3 year old would wash his hands.And check out the warrenty information before purchasing. It's gonna cost $10 for return shipping/insurance plus the cost of shipping the thing to the manufacturer, so it's cheaper to buy a new one than to use the warrenty."
5,My 3-year old loves this toy,"I really like Doug and Melissa toys. I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old for Christmas and she loves it. It is easy for little hands to dress the ""realistic"" dolls. I usually have to keep this toy up when friends come by because it is one of those things that get fought over."
2,"Basely entertaining, but somehow misses the mark","After watching Hood Life 2, you can probably find it easy to praise the production values of Bum Fights. In all, this ""documentary"" is unwatchable, too much handheld DV night shot and an annoying repetative soundtrack. However, there are some people who want to watch poor people fighting like this."
5,fun,Got this to go with my daughters new kitchen and she loves it. she has so much fun making sandwiches and then cutting them with the knife. Cutting them apart is her favorite part. I've seen similar ones made out of felt but the wood is cleaner and doesn't wear out. I definately recommend this and all the melissa and doug food items like this.
2,If you've never taken freshman comp,"This would be a great book for a freshman composition class, or for someone with zero experience writing. It's not a bad book, I was just looking for something more advanced. I've since learned of the existance of Phillip Lopate."
1,Can It Really Be So Bad?,"I wanted to learn more about post colonial studies because it is research interest of my girlfriend. Definitely not finding any merit in PC studies from this book which reads more like a cheap leftist political tract than anything like a textbook, as other reviewers have indicated.Pretty funny when author asks in the introduction ""how many faces of power can you think of that are brown?"" ... also in introduction ""There was a time when any book you might read, any speech you might read, any film you saw was told from the point of view of the male."" From here I am assuming the book only gets better and better."
3,Whoa!,"I wouldn't offer to share this with my reading buddies or even mention I own it, but the book certainly provides a unique portrayal of the life of Kinky. I laughed out loud at some of it, felt manipulated and propagandized at some of it, found myself bored at times, but I never wanted to put it down. This short book elicited a wide array of reactions on my part, but delving into the mind of a man as unpredictable as this author can't help but be well...unpredictable."
3,Causual Interest in Topic,"This book is obviously geared for the person that is really into this topic. For that point of view the book is average and there are better, more detailed volumes out there. If you are looking at this just as a curiosity or as a casual reader then it fits the bill. There are a large number of color photos / pictures that give you a taste for the look and feel but the quality of the pictures are not all that good. Personally I would have liked more detail but as a primer to the topic the book is antiquate."
3,It was okay,"I don't want to spoil this book for anyone however the police chief and his officers seemed incompetent. After they realized that Amy/ Amanda was being followed and even after 2 connected murders were committed, they made no attempt to put her sisters somewhere safe. They made no attempt to bring the reporter in for questioning when they suspected an information leak. They suspected that phones were tapped but they never exchanged them.Also the characters didn't feel real to me. Their personalities shifted a lot and I felt there was no emotional connection to any of them. The book had two major plots which distracted from one another and overwhelme the book."
3,OK book,"After having read the O'Malley series I was a bit dissappointed in this book. I expected the same type of ""page turner"" content as was in the O'Malley books. The Witness, in my opinion, was a slow read. It started off great and had my attention....but after the initial burst of action, the rest of the book moved very slowly. There was more focus on the characters and less on the action. I agree with a previous post stating that this book seemed to be rushed to publication before completion. I did not like the ending either. For the sake of spoiling it for you, I won't say why, but if you read the book you'll see what I mean. It didn't seem to fit.I like Dee Henderson's style of writing, with believable characters and convincing plot. This just wasn't among my favorite books she has written. (She knocked it out of the ballpark with the O'Malley books and set her own standard pretty high!)"
2,The Witness,"I agree with the review that called this book a disappointment. It started out with so much promise, that I was amazed at my good fortune at obtaining it for free on my Kindle! It was fast paced, kept the pages turning, wanting to see what happend next. Then the ""romance"" never goes anywhere for any of the couples, the attraction is there but the author doesn't develop it further. Without spoiling the book, there is an event that happens about 3/4 of the way through that adds a layer of darkness to a book that already has a possible serial killer and a woman being hunted, to it and this event does nothing to add to the story. It's just sad and dark. I also agree, the author leaves you hanging with the ending. You didn't get a satisfying feeling of closure that most books give you."
4,Great Relaxing Tunes,This is a Euro Acid/Jazz House mix. Great sounds for cruising or just lounging at home!
3,Skip track 12!!!,"This album has several good tracks the best being AMANDA by Brooklyn Queens, they really give the song new life. There are a few really bad covers as well, the worst being Madhouses cover of LIKE A PRAYER! The female vocalist has no emotion at all, she is simply yelling out words, it leaves you wondering if she even understands what she is ""singing."" This track is just so bad it forces an other wise 4 star album to get only 3."
5,LOVE this cookie book!,"i think we've had this book in my family for about a decade. some of the pages are torn and floured, but we still love it! we have had so much fun over the years experimenting with the recipes, and we still have many more to try out!i HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who enjoys baking. the recipes are easy to follow and i have never been disappointed by the way my cookies have turned out!"
3,Nuts and Bolts -Volvo 850 Series '93'97 (Haynes Manuals),"Just what you have come to expect from Haynes/Chilton. This is a pretty thorough overview of the Volvo 850's systems, maintenance, and repair. It is not as thorough as some more expensive maintenance manuals. But it will get you through most procedures. If you get stumped, there are plenty of Volvo forums and user groups out there to fill in the fine details.All in all, it is a great starting point for maintaining your own car. Just remember that you will have to fo somewhere else for fine detail."
5,gread picture,"Great picture for girls facing bulling, this movie it is a must, i definitely recommend it, parents can talk to kids about it."
3,A mysterious album for adults,"There are few albums as diverse as this one. It's a real challenge for any listener. There are three less-than-a-minute tracks of aggressive, hardcore jazz/rock. Then there's the title track, which starts off with a string quartet and ends with the sounds of splitered wood and whip cracks. Cycles du Nord is over ten minutes of wind --- yes, ten minutes of wind. Then there's the music box song, a bit of Latin guitar, and a little lullaby on percussion and celeste.Buy this if you're feeling VERY adventurous. If not, try Taboo & Exile first. Or The Gift. Those albums have the same format --- lots of different musical styles, including sound effects and noisy stuff --- but they are more accessible."
5,BEST KITCHEN EVER!!!!,This really is the best kitchen. It looks so realistic and the sounds are fun. This kitchen has it all. It's well worth the money. Get the Step2 food too...its really fun! My daughter is only 9 months and she loves it!
4,"Great toy, one design flaw","Purchased kitchen for daughter's second birthday. She loves it and makes pretend food and drinks for us all the time. The appliances make really cool sounds.One drawback is that the cooking area is under the cabinet and kinda small, while the sinks are comparitively big and centrally placed. I think this is a major design flaw, which results in the sinks being used as counter space."
5,fantastic,We bought this for our 3 year old son and he LOVES it! It was EASY to assemble and is very durable!
3,Rendering,"This book is full of beautiful renderings of Charles Woods designs. It also shows you the way he uses his module system for designing them. The things I didn't like about this book is that the photo's of some of the finished interiors looked quite bland and cheap compared to the renderings. Also most of the houses are not designed for families with more than 1 or 2 kids. Lots of the houses where designed for earth berming or underground, and most of them are designed for huge lots with hills to build into. In the real world we have small flat lots. I would like to see a book on how to build an attractive underground house into a real world lot that would be big enough for 4 kids. There is some really nice architecture in this book though."
3,The Mercy of Intolerance,"Picked this book up from the library as I was working on a project for the Josh McDowell Ministries. Just wanted something light and interesting to read after long days at the office.Honestly the first 2/3's of the book was rather slow. Not particularly interesting and a bit laboring. The final third did present more interest and I felt like the book finally had something of interest to present.A good read when considering voting just on someone's policy. A reminder that their is more to policy than just right or wrong, but also the implementation and practice of the policy. Challenged me to think again about what is said and what is done in practice by our political leaders ... and myself!"
3,Very hard!,I didn't expect this board to be so hard to break. You really have to crack down on it but it'll take time to learn a technique.
2,Barbie Trailrider,"I purchased the Barbie Trailrider for my 4 yr old grandaughter and purchased the Ninja Kawasaki for my 5 yr old grandaughter. They were the same price , but the Ninja is much faster and has the twelve volt battery . The 4 yr old does not want to ride the Trailrider because it is so slow. I feel I wasted my money on the Barbie Trailrider. Tried to return it to Toyrus they would not take it back, tried to return it through power wheels company , they would only refund 3/4 of my money and it would be 8 to 12 weeks before I would recieve it . Don't buy the Barbie Trailrider for any child over two yrs. old. It is not fast enough."
3,Good Product,"I recently purchased this book for my cousin who is two years of age. I would not recommend this item for any child under the age of four. There are small pieces that could easily be lost or swallowed. However, the item is very colorful and a wonderful learning tool for preschoolers."
4,Hero's come in all sizes,"Baby Mouse Our Hero is a fun book about a mouse who has all the problems of a typical child. Kids that pick on her. Don't forget to take out the garbage. Is your homework done yet? For Babymouse, her trouble of the moment is three weeks of dodgeball in gym. She has never been good at it, yet she can't get out of it since it is a big part of her grade. Babymouse series is written in comic book form and keeps you smiling until the end. The book is written for young readers, whether you are reading it with them or they read it by themselves, it is sure to please its audience.By Kerri J. BusteedAuthor of Will's First HuntWill's First Hunt"
1,Don't try this in public!,"I can only give 1 star for the idea behind the book, but the author should have consulted a wider range of people to get to know the typical ""German slang"". Words like ""abasten"" or ""abflottieren"" really don't exist in the actual German language. If you want to know about German slang, buy a book like ""Kauderwelsch: American Slang, das Andere Englisch"" from Annette Linnemann and Renate Georgi-Walsk, where you can see the German expression for American slang, too. Or just ask the people around you in Germany, they will help you for sure. But don't buy this book, it's really not worth it."
5,New Amsterdam: Live at Heineken Music Hall,"Excellent CD !!!!!!! Of course, I love EVERYTHING that they do, produce, write and sing..........................................................Just my humble opinion..................................................For what it's worth.....................................................Kathleen B. RiddleKathleen Riddle...same as above....."
5,Great live album from a great band,"Perhaps Nick needs to listen to albums before he chooses to review them. New Amsterdam is the live album I have always hoped Counting Crows would make. It features a great setlist (the absence of many of their ""hits"" is a plus, because it features many great, underplayed songs) and a fantastic mix that allows the listener to clearly hear every instrument. The arrangements of the songs showcase their talented instrumentalists, and Adam is in great form.I've never really understood the reputation Counting Crows have with some people as a terrible live band - I listen to a lot of live music, and to my ears they're a fantastic live band. If you're not a fan, I doubt anything will convert you, but if you are, this is an essential purchase."
1,"One of the worst concert bands ever, with a terrible setlist!","To me, the Counting Crows have been one of the most lackluster concert acts the past two decades. The tracklist for this CD doesn't help since it omits the majority of hit songs the band has released since their inception. Stay away!"
1,Service is non-existent,"I've tried repeatedly to contact service for replacement parts after the pedal broke on my machine. Noone answers their phone, their answering machine says that Service and Tech Support are closed - even during the middle of a weekday, they don't answer voice mails, and numerous emails have gone unanswered. Sounds a lot like a company trying to rake in some Christmas $$ before they go out of business."
1,Not Light,"I ordered this pet food specifically because it said it is 'light'. My dog is overweight and I ordered this to help reduce her weight. Nowhere on the bag I received does it ever say 'light'. I had read the same problem on several other reviews and thought maybe it was just a run of mistakes that were now corrected. Not! Still no light - stay far, far away from this if you want 'light' food for your dog."
2,Not what I thought!,"Nothing special! All this book contains is the original holiday story from 6 of the American Girls: Samantha's surprise, Kirsten's surprise, etc. They just combined the stories into one volume and added a bonus CD. So I gave it two stars because the CD is the only good part about this since I already owned these stories."
4,Comfortable slip on,This is a favorite style for me as I have trouble wearing closed shoes. I like to wear a heel and can wear these for many hours without discomfort.
4,Shoes,"I really like these aerosole shoes. They stretch out quickly, but the shoes are very comfortable right from the start."
5,Great Collection,"For the serious or casual LeRoy Anderson fan, this is a must have collection. Has all those songs you've heard on the radio and said to yourself, ""I've heard that before - now what is it called?"""
5,Awesome!!,"Bought the DVD online after doing the condensed free workout from Comcast's OnDemand menu. Totally love this DVD! My roommates and I use it all the time, I really like how they separate the low impact and high impact workouts, and the options to customize your workout. It's great because you can select the areas that you are interested in working out or select your routines based on how much time you have. Don't worry if you're a beginner or buff and tone already, they show three different levels of intensity for each move, so it's perfect for everyone. Plus the DVD has a ton of extra work outs and bonus features too! Definitely recommend this DVD :)"
4,"Can't be beat for the price, does it's job well","Picked this up to get free shipping on another order - matches my lime Gen2 Nano well, and flipping the cover backward and tying it with the included band works well as a stand. The Ipod is only anchored at the sides, so I have noticed the Nano to slide down from time to time (makes me worried that it'll fall out completely one day. I originally used a sports version with armband from this company before, but this one allows for much easier access to the data port and is ultra simplistic in design."
5,Wow! No shrimp on this barbie!,"I have just received First Barbecue. What anincredible surprise! What can I say? It's wonderful.And it continues to surprise with everynew track. It's jazz. No, it's funk. No, it's kind ofbluegrass. No, it's ballads. No, it's Chicago TransitAuthority. No, it's Talking Heads. Okay, okay. So JeffGeoffray is multitalented.I think my favorite is Bring Me Rain. But it depends onwhat I feel like when I'm listening to it. The CD offersa track for every mood I've had, and some I've neverexperienced. Yet.If I were forced to characterize the CD as a body ofwork, I would say it definitely speaks Broadway production.And although the production quality is massive, it's notrequired. The beauty of the melodies and lyrics would beevident with a single guitar and solo singer.And it's certainly a showcase of Jeff Geoffray's versatility.I can't wait to see which direction this artist spins next.What's for dessert?"
3,"""Being There"" starring Zizek!","Perhaps I'm just not up to speed here but Mr. Zizek(!) seems to have everything to say and nothing to say all at the same time. Listening to him speak he seems to be saying something profound but I can't discern any substance of practical value in his ideas. But maybe this is the whole point.Fortunately, Mr. Zizek does have a good sense of humor which helps make this exercise in mental gymnastics somewhat entertaining. I enjoyed the part where he suggests that people who want to commit suicide should have to apply to a specially appointed committee for approval to do so. Also, his interpretation of the film classic 'Casablanca' was quite humorous. But I can't help wondering whether it's more than just a coincidence that one of his favorite movies is 'Being There', a very funny movie in which everybody mistakes the main character (played by Peter Sellers) for a genius."
5,IMPORTANT MESSAGE,"Hello, this is Nadinia of Alanis Zone. This is the best bio on Alanis in the universe. It is interesting and has tons of facts and pictures. However, it is essential that I forewarn all potential purchasers of this fantastic book that the text of this bio is EXACTLY the same as the text in the books Alanis Morissette: You Oughta Know and Jagged. You see, Paul Cantin has only written 1 book, but it has been published by different people under different names. In other words, they are all identical except for the covers and Alanis Morissette: A biography has a condensed version of pictures. For the latest news on Alanis, please visit Alanis Zone."
5,Excellent! Best Biography I've Ever Read!,"This book is so well-researched, I'm wondering if God wrote it himself! In this wonderful book, by paul Cantin, it has neve-before-seen photos, and from moment to moment acurrencies!"
5,Awesome book,What a fabulous book - I am so happy I bought it. The book arrived as described and the service was excellent! I am a very happy customer.
3,Seems to help...,"I'm not a big believer in herbal remedies, but figured I'd give this product a try due to reviews I'd seen on the site. I've got a kitten with chronic eye goo. Have used this in conjunction with eye antibiotic ointment. Appears to work better than with antibiotic alone. Am not sure whether this relates to the any of the herbs or just the fact that the eye gets a good rinse before the antibiotic goes on. Still, given the results I would repurchase the product."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,Its to small. unless your a chick and have a really small mouth. Its a wast of your money. It was a wast of mine. BUYER BE WARE!!!!!
3,Good quality but small,Don't like to give bad reviews. This is a very good quality product. But didn't work for me as much as I expected. The mouthguard is too small for an adult. Get it for a kid or for a girl and you'll be happy.
3,Stick with generic!,"The gel ripped off way to easily and its too bulky in the mouth. I don't think its worth the cost because I had a generic mouthgaurd that lasted for years, and the gel started coming of within the first week I used them for practice. I say you stick with generic!"
4,Mouth guard review,It works for the most part but does not mold perfictly with my upper teeth. Every time I reset it either the back or the front mold but not both.
3,a lil bulky,It it huge...but it works. It comes out of my mouth some nights. It is just really bulky and not really comfortable.
4,Caveat Emptor,"Another misleading page in Amazon. The information does not mention at all that this is only vol.1, Jeesus!So if you think you'll be getting the whole Jean Christophe saga in one book only, you're in for a surprise that will cost you around $50.Aside from that, my ""surprise"" was in perfect order, a brand new book in cloth."
1,Horrible,"The choice of the songs is ok, but the arrangements are excruciating. The first listening was very painful. I decided to give it a second chance and now I definitely know that I will never listen to this CD again. Only recommendable for people who don't mind to listen to the simplest, plainest, most inexpressive pop-style pseudo-folk. The rythm section of the group Hagevatron should be banned from the profession (or better yet, executed). Unbearable."
5,Her Life and Her Books Inspire,"After having fallen in love with Gwen Frostic's creative books of prose illustrated with beautiful nature prints, I wanted to find out more about the woman and artist who crafted these treasures. Author Sheryl James does an excellent job rounding out the picture of the creator of these simple treasures, especially given that she had little direct information from Gwen Frostic herself, who did not really care to have a biography written. Heavily relying on bits and pieces of personal history and background information from Gwen's family members, Ms. James compiles a flowing account of the life of this exceptional woman. Gwen Frostic stood out from the crowd, followed her heart, and brought joy to so many through her artistry, and, in the process, brought happiness and prosperity to herself. Gwen's lovely books inspire in and of themselves. Her life story and accomplishments are inspirational, too. Especially for the Gwen Frostic fan, this biography is a must read!"
3,good anime,Wolf's Rain is a slow but interesting story. A good movie for anime and werewolf fans. I was happy the DVD worked.
2,Infantry Weapons of WWII,"Good pictures, but very disorganized. Seems like they hurried to get it published. Several guns were in the wrong category, wording was sketchy at best. Doesn't look like anybody proofed it before it went to publication."
1,Don't Buy This Garbage!!!,Very disappointed in this product. Made sure the battery compartment was securely closed and lowered it in 2' of water. Went out to check on it three hours later and saw no light. Pulled it up and water had gotten into the battery compartment and shorted everything out. Worst piece of garbage I have ever bought on Amazon.
3,Pretty Good for price but...,"The price is fairly decent compared to the rest of the underwater lights, the thing I didn't like is that it floats :( It comes attached w/ a tiny little clip and a string. I'm afraid if I add weight to the bottom of the unit, the tiny little clip will snap and everything will get lost underwater. So now I have to add weight and a new stronger line, and a better clip. Like I said, nice unit, but more work required before I get it in the water..."
3,A Beautifully Problematic Novel,"Lois-Ann Yamanaka is truly a gifted writer. Her use of the poetic in the novel form is absolutely stunning. However, I cannot give Blu's Hanging as high of a rating as I would like to because I found her depictions of Filipino-Americans to be highly offensive. Her representations of Filipino-Americans as sexual predators and ""human rats"" have the potential to perpetuate divisiveness along racial lines in the Asian-American community as well as to create new stereotypes about Filipino Americans. Although the main plot of the three Ogata children is a gripping narrative which is infused with the indomitable nature of the human spirit, Blu's Hanging is a novel that left a bad taste in my mouth."
4,Good,It works.However you have to be fairly limber to get in and out of it without cracking the seat. It's 3/16 plywood which might work if the seat were gusseted to support its edges. Instead the only way the user can sit down without breaking it is to deeply squat back onto the heels monkey style and thne plop down.Despite the cheap plywood the rest of the stretcher is good quality from the worm gear drive that feels very solid to the adjustable back that facilitates quick positioning while sitting in the machine.It needs a few improvements to cure the flimsy seat issue but overall I'm happy with it.I can see that it might not last without user intervention; ie replacing the seat
2,Lunch Bag,I thought it would be much larger. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. I found a better one at Target.
4,Bought to replace a similar model that's no longer made.,This lunch cooler is very good for kids who take their lunch to school. Lots of compartments to meet the preservation and packaging needs all all different varieties of snacks and foods. Keeps items dry that need it and insulates the hot and cold items. Made of durable materials that seem to withstand the challenges by the activities and misuse of young children!
4,"GOOD SIZE, GOOD SIZE, ADEQUATE QUALITY","This cooler has a good design. The upper compartment is completely separate from the main compartment and is also insulated. The main compartment is roomy enough for lunch and some snacks.The zippers do stick a little at first but don't look like a real problem. I would like more zippered pockets, thicker insulation and stiffer sides."
1,Cooling my garbage can now.,"As others have said, zipper is problematic. Mine broke 30 seconds into the first use. It broke again and I kept fixing it - but now it detached completely tonight and I'm out a cooler. Probably should've returned it the first time it happened.Zipper aside, I really wanted to keep this cooler, everything else about it is great."
4,Good anime,"I like the Trinity Blood series. I just wish it would have had a proper ending, which is not unusual for anime not to end with a final volume. Overall, I liked it."
4,Pretty Good Introduction,"As an early childhood teacher, I use this book as a carry over from my university days. It covers the main issues, theories, and primary literature with relative simplicity allowing you to escape getting overwhelmed by too much techy language...but get more texts. Buying this one book will not suffice in the classroom."
1,"okay, this isn't leather!","I ordered this ""leather journal"" to receive a journal with cardboard binding wrapped in paper printed to look like leather. I guess you get what you pay for, but this is definitely a misleading ad.It just looks cheep."
2,cute but not worth it,"I thought this was very cute i bought it for my son when he was a baby for his first Halloween. The fabric is very thin and feels like it could rip easy, the foam peas keep falling off and they kept getting in my sons face the real size of this would be more like 4-6 months way to big for a 0 month old baby. the hat was itchy on my son so we had to put another hat under it. i thought it was cute but i really didn't think it was worth it"
2,Cute but not well made,"This costume is cute, but not very well made. The velcro on the ""peas"" is stronger than the glue holding it. I had to reglue the velcro onto the styrafoam several times.The body of the ""pod"" is extremely big for 0-6 months, however the hat that came with it just barely fit my 3 month old. The strap under the chin was very snug."
2,okay...,"This looked so cute! When I got it, it was not as cute, I thought it would be better quality. The peas are attached by velcro and kept falling off. I had to re-glue the velcro strips to the pea. When I put it on my daughter it did look very cute, though."
2,Just A Sawed Down Jo.,"Received this item in a timely manner. However, this Hanbo (36 inches) appears to be a Jo that was roughly sawed off on one end. So, one end of this Hanbo is rounded and the other end is a flat cut with splintering along its perimeter. There is also an uneven coat of paint on the sawed off end."
4,VERY GOOD BOOK,"A very good book for people trying to prepare for Networking essentials exam. Needs more work on questions and routing/bridging/gateway part, but if you can get your hands on good exam questions you will be OK. Only used this book and a sample questions and passed the exam on the first try."
3,stack n store,These are very light weight and I thought they might be heavier. They barely hold 35 lbs of dog food.
5,Understanding the newest PC(USA) Confession,"Placher and Willis-Watkins, the consultant members of the committee writing the Brief Statment of Faith, come through with a magnificent book which articulates the theology, formation, scriptual basis, and poetry behind the confession. By using doctrine and the trinity, the authors do a line by line analysis of this statement of faith in a readable and enjoyable format. I would highly recommend this book to anyone studying this statement of faith."
4,"Great game, though it has some tech issues","I was so excited when I Sim Theme Park finally came to Mac. I got it for Christmas and played it for six hours straight that day. The game is great, the graphics are great, the concept is great. The glitches are not great. I had problems playing several times as the game would freeze and force me to restart the computer. Usually it is when you try to change modes, to the map view for example. After adjusting virtual memory, memory allocation, game settings (had to lower the graphics and sound quality a lot) the game go a little more stable, but it still crashes sometimes. The other problem is that as you play the game (having saved frequently) and develop your park more and more, the game starts to slow down almost to the point of being annoying. I have 128 mb of memory, and even with nothing else running, it eventually isn't enough. So basically, great game, even if there are some running problems."
1,BEWARE! This game is a lemon!,"We bought this game three weeks ago and still have yet to play! Running it on a G4 with plenty of RAM, graphics card, etc. Get an Error message (Error: Engine Failed to Initialize) Aspyr's web site is VERY aware of this problem. It has to do with the game setting the color depth. There is a patch. We downloaded the patch, and it does not work. We tried setting color depth manually, and did everything on Aspyr's web site to get this to run - no dice. To date we are waiting for Aspyr to reply to our MANY requests for help. Save yourself the headache. Don't buy it!"
1,"fun game, but too many technical problems","This Game is loads of fun, but only when it works. The game has had a tendacy to crash and freeze way too much. On top of that several times the data files for the game have become corrupeted and unplayable. So not only do you have to reinstall the game but you lose all of your parks. Mayby I just got a bad disk, but from the looks of the reviews there are quite a few ""bad disks"". Don't buy this game unless you enjoy games with too many technical problems."
5,"stretching machines, karate, gadget, stretching, martial arts, flexibility, century, stretching machine, martial",this is good for the pric as i could not afford the price of one of the more expensive priced strechers.
1,"Even for free, don't bother","For decades I've respected and admired Cybill Shepherd as a spokesmodel, actress and even as a singer, but after reading this wretched autobiography I find her self-absorbed and thoroughly nauseating. If you like her, do yourself a favor and avoid this book. This is the kind of bile people write after the subject matter dies."
4,maybe a beauty book next time?,"Cybill has certainly been a busy, busy girl. She lost me when she seemed to brag that she is a liar, and the constant defensiveness about ""they done me wrong"" wore thin. But that cover photo! Wow! I'd like to know her workout and beauty secrets!"
1,Bring your dictionary!,"I got the book because it was free on the Kindle. I thought a few freebies would be a good place to start building up my new Kindle library. I made it to about page 50 or so. I grew very tired of hearing how beautiful Cybill thought she was...over and over and over. There were very few times that she wasn't going on and on about her ""beatiful blonde hair"".I found myself having to use the dictionary function on the device. Using it way too often, I might add. I am not illiterate, and I have a decent vocabulary, but please... let's use words that people can understand. I looked up one word after another. With many of these fancy words, after reading the definition, I asked myself ""Why not just use THAT word?"". It is almost like she is trying too hard to show us how smart she is. I might have continued beyond page 50, if she hadn't written it as a vain, thesaurus owner.1 Star, because there is not a 0 star option.No Thanks!"
2,Something's should be left unsaid,Although an interesting read with regards to the behind the scenes goings on in hollywood this book was better unwritten. 50% of the book is Cybill`s bed hopping with man after man regardless of whether they are married or not. I came away with a bad taste in my mouth and my impression of her forever changed. I would have asked for my money back if I had paid for this book but as it was free all I can say is I wasted my time not my money.
4,There Must Be Another Side To This Story,"I found this to be an interesting and easy read. Once I got into the story I found myself wanting to see how it would end. It is a description of a girl from a somewhat dysfunctional family who made it big as a model early in life, but has never found consistent happiness. I will give Cybill credit for being frank and honest. She pulled no punches especially regarding her many casual and long term love interests. She certainly has had no problem with constant infidelity and casual sex. After reading descriptions of all the broken relationships in her personal and professional life, I can't help but suspect there are other sides to the story. She sounds like a Type-A personality who would, and has, worn out every relationship and has, over time, alienated most everyone around her."
2,Why Doesn't She Have Any Friends? You'll See.,"I never thought a tell-all book could bore or irritate me, especially with stories about a hometown Memphis girl making it big and sleeping with Elvis, but this one did. I was interested in hearing about Cybill's life, but after reading this book I don't care to hear any more. My copy was signed by Cybill in person, but meeting her was the high point of the whole experience and it only lasted a minute or two. I liked Cybill Shepherd, but I think a lot less of her after reading this. I don't recommend this book."
5,Kindle version needs editing,"She's blunt about her sex life and the movie business (at least the way she sees it). I was surprised at the ""Who's who"" she has slept with. But those were different times and I admit I found it interesting in a National Inquirer sort of way.The Kindle version is drowning in typos. It was annoying and distracting, especially when ""i"" was confused with ""1"", which appeared many times.But for what I paid (nothing), I can't really complain."
2,wish i hadn't read it,"this book wasn't badly written, but my opinion of this actress changed entirely as i read. honest? i guess, if you want to know about how she finally got that threesome she wanted. my impression is that this lady has fewer brains than i always thought. surely there's more to life that the shallow experiences she had throughout her life! but then again maybe there's more to the story than a life of distracted pants-chasing. if so, i'd like to read that book about her, but i'll say again...wish i hadn't read this one!"
3,Glad it was free,"It was entertaining; but I'm glad it was a freebie on my Kindle. I wish they'd had someone proof the copy one last time. Several times I had to stop and figure out what she meant to write. Typos happen, but I didn't expect so many, and in the end that detracted from the story."
2,boring read,"I tried to read this 3 times now, and it can't keep my interest. It's a never ending list of who she slept with and how raunchy she is. Not very good at all."
4,CYBILL IS FOR REAL..BUT DIFFERENT,This was a fun book that was very well written. Cybill Shepherd certainly pipes to her own drummer and points out how we are all so different to each other. This woman is a survivor who loves life and particularly sex. Her escapades are many but her maturing is evident as time goes on...slowly.There is a fair amount of Hollywood anecdotes that are interesting and a life that is still unraveling. One of her daughters looks like her twin and I recommend this book to all.
5,Speed: The missing link.,"""I want to thank you for sending me a copy of your manual; I found it to be informative and helpful. This is a great supplement to anyone involved in martial arts, as most training lacks in this area I find. If there were more of this integrated into the common dojo practice, I believe that we would be pumping out much more effective martial artists, whether it be for sport, for livelihood, or for self defense."""
5,Craving for More!,"The highest complement I can give a book is to say that I began to read it and did not want to put it down. I can give Sacred Ashes that complement. When I did finished with it I was saddened that the journey it had taken me on was all over. But, it really wasn't over because this book is the kind of novel you finish and can't stop thinking about. I immediately rushed out and told all my friends to read it (trying not to give away the ingenious plot, which is not an easy task). I can't wait till they all finish it so we can discuss this thought inspiring novel."
5,Sacred Ashes,"This is by far the best book I have read at any time during my life span of over eighty years, and I have read too many to even begin to count. Not only is it well written but is an inspirational work of art. Elizabeth Dost's talents exceed over and above the ordinary writer. It is worthy of the highest praise. I recommend this book, without hesitation to everyone."
3,Safe enough,"I was really hoping for a little more padding and a little less thwacking so we could practice actual hits with less chance of injury. While these are padded, they are still very rigid and do hurt, though not like getting hit with wooden sticks. I also had difficulty peeling the big gold stickers off them, which tore the padding as they came off."
3,Music stands,I thought I was ordering solid music stands but got the fold-up kind which I already had several of. I need the type the schools use but that is not what I got .
4,Good stand for a decent price,"At first I thought the stand was broken when I initially tried to put it together. The part that telescopes up and down would not move, and I was about to give up and start the hassle of returning, but thankfully, I tried one final time and really put some muscle into it. It was just stuck together and once unstuck, moved freely. The rest of the assembly was easy, and so far, the stand has been great. I don't really need to adjust the height that often, so I can't really comment on the durability of the plastic screws, but it serves me well."
2,music stand,"This arrived bent in the original packing. It is of inferior, but servicable materials. I would not recommend anyone purchasing it unless they just want a cheap stand."
4,Very good rug!,I expected very little from an online rug order. But I was willing to take a chance. This rug just is awesome!. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is that the rug is little rolled up on the edges. Not a very big deal.
3,Looks cute,Received the watch and the battery was dead so had to replace that to use it. Bought this for a 7yr old girl who loves green and she likes it. Will see how long it lasts. Great price if it lasts.
3,Not bad...,I got this product because I wanted to try my hand at a new weapon. I have extensive experience with bo and nunchuck so this gave me a nice combination of the two. My only real complaint is that the center piece tends to bend and sway when in use. I used tape and taped the entire center pole tight which reinforced it pretty well but it still bends in use. over all a good weapon to get experience with but you will need to get a heavier one to get a better feeling.
3,First season all over again.,"I found this DVD to pretty much be a rerun of their first season. I know there was some hang up with the first season footage, and this seems to have ""fixed"" it. There were some funny things on there, but I had seem them already. Some of those included:RugbyThe Milk ChallengePontious as SatanSkateboard WheelNight MonkeySelf DefenseStun CollarFastfood FootballAlso, the guys jumped into A Lot of bushes, which had been done to death in the first season. I was really disappointed because this is billed as new material and it's not.Another thing that pulled it down for me was that these were the early skits where they didn't really have editing down. The funny parts were present, but so was all the dead air before and after. Yes, there were some funny things in this DVD, and if you're a fan it's for you, but this isn't one I'd buy. Renting it and seeing it once was good enough."
2,"Typical ""camp"" stuff","These 2 episodes are typical examples of how the ""camp"" idealbegun by TV's ""Batman"" show highly influenced this series,spelling out the way for its eventual demise. Illya's sillycombat tactics in ""Hula Doll"" further portray him as a Russian""Robin the Boy Wonder"" to Solo's Batguy."
1,Broke after a couple weeks,"For $30, this was not a good value. It was really hard to use (the ignition button was very tough to work), then it seemed to run out of fluid constantly, would only light when held at a certain angle (almost upside down), and now it won't light at all. Bummer."
1,"Slow and steady wins the race, Klara Kormendi didn't get that memo.","I regret purchasing this album, because the music's pace is far too fast to be enjoyable. Satie is meant to be enjoyed in the background and at a leisurely pace. Listening to the Gymnopedies and Gnossiennes being sped up the way are is a travesty, it puts too much focus on PAYING ATTENTION to the music, instead of having it create an ambience as such music is intended to. Maybe she should have paid attention to the orchestrations of the Gymnopedies at the end and focused on that tempo."
5,johnny horton's greatest hits,everything i thought it would be love the lyrics and what a voice can recommend this cd with confidence enjoy
5,Whats not to like?,"Once you factor in the free month, you save about $10.00 over ordering directly on xbox live. ($44.00 with free shipping and 13 months compared to $49.99 on Live for 12 months.) Couldn't be easier to update, just enter the code on the back of the card and your done. Note: Microsoft seems to have fixed the code rubbing off problem some earlier reviewers were having. There is nothing to rub off. Code is printed on back of card. The only drawback I can see is if you renew on xbox live your account in updated instantly. If you order from amazon you have to wait until your card arrives to update your account so plan accordingly and order early, you'll save $$$$$ and get an extra month."
1,DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON!,"I've read reviews saying it's cheaper to order from amazon. That's true, but only by a few dollars, and the super saver shipping takes about a month (I am not exagerating; that was the estimate). If you want it in ""only"" two weeks, you have to pay a few bucks and then it costs as much as it does in the store. I cancelled my order after they fouled it up completely, and ordered from newegg instead. It was considerably cheaper there, but I don't want to sound like I'm plugging newegg. I'm really just recommending that, for the time being, you buy the card ANYWHERE but amazon. They are inept at shipping a PIECE OF PLASTIC in a plastic container. This is the first time I have been dissapointed with Amazon, and I'll continue buying most of my things here since the price is good and shipping is (normally) very good (and free).I just can't get over the fact that this little thing is so difficult for amazon to ship."
1,amazon drops the ball. Costco WINS!,Xbox 360 Live 12 Month Gold Card plus 1 Month BonusI was going to buy this subscription today but the price went up to $83.99. It was $59.99. I knew prices were going up but i thought that the Amazon price was somewhat realistic. Well it turns out they offer the card for 43.99 and the download is $59.99. What is up with that???I bought a subscription at Costco last month for 38.99 for the card including shipping but only one per household. Then the cards disappeared from the Costco.com site. I went back today and the offer was back. So I spent $38.99 for the one year subscription by mail from Costco.com. Not to date myself but I have been a member for over 20 years and I have no doubts that should the card code be unreadable I can resolve it at my local Costco warehouse.Sorry Amazon but this time you dropped the ball big time.
5,Amazon is the best!,This is for the xbox 360 xbox live Gold card. Amazon had it for a reasonable price and was fast getting it to me. I always trust Amazon for getting what I need.
5,worth the money,"gets you access to netflix's instant-at-home movies and tv shows (including up to date episodes of Heroes w/o commercials). early access to new game demos and expanded dlc. i haven't used silver membership, but i am totally in love with my gold membership. 3 stars for ""fun"" because ""fun"" isn't a factor."
5,great buy,"Buying this 12 month xbox live gold card from amazon was cheaper than most stores I could have driven to. The shipping was also really fast, it took only a couple days. I would highly recommend ordering this if you need an xbox live gold card."
3,Better than you'd think.,"This game isn't bad, despite people thinking anything Disney is horrible. It has very similar mechanics as the Tony Hawk series, but it falls short in the game variet of the THPS series. That doesn't mean it isn't fun, however. The game will be more fun than THPS4 in your first time through, but it won't keep you playing forever. All in all, it's a good rental/buy if you're a Disney fan... if not, just get Tony Hawk."
4,Highly Commendable,"You get the sense from the start that the author understands and sympathises with the position of the LGBT community, and also has a scholarly understanding of the Word of God. This book acts as a bridge, appreciating the tensions between both sides, and articulating a sensible approach to the problem. it is not dogmatic. It is not prejudiced.I feel a book like this would benefit by having a glossary as an appendix. Assumptions that people with an interest in this subject have formal education is not valid. I also feel that the design of the cover does not do justice to the work.Frank Ryan OMI"
5,Sweet,i'm 24 and i still watch anime. i've started watching this when it first came out on Cartoon Network. and loved the show i got a whole season 1 on VHS But i perfer DVD i can't wait for this to come out
5,Bridge book,This is an easy reference for bridge players & an excellent book for beginners. I would recommend it for any level bridge player as ahandy guide to better bridge.
3,Not what I thought,"I originally got this book thinking it was the Geoff Burch one. It's not and I think suffers from that. Having said that, it does have some fantastic information in and it s usefull resource for anyone starting up a business. Unfortunately I didn't get the same enjoyment from reading this that Mr Burch's book (also titles ""go it alone"") gave me."
4,Go it alone,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. There is great information in here about when to leave your job, when your are planning on starting your own buisness. Good office etiquette advice about what to say or not to say about your new venture. Wish I had read this earlier!"
2,"Flashy, and not the best sound.","This level of flash and bling would be good for a lounge or perhaps a teenager's room, but adults might find the flashing too much and very distracting. Moreover, the quality of sound is marginal at best. Perhaps best for watching DVDs with lots of fight scenes and car crashes for rough sound effects, but not for a concert video or listening to music on a long-term basis."
4,Good book,Good book. Provides comprehensive review about math part. But pretty easy for GMAT takers.
1,Fudge Muffin Special,"If you don't like the blues (i.e. you need something ""fresh"") then ol' Jonny has it for you. ""Deep Feeling"" and ""Pure Emotion"" buy the square yard. The kid spews notes by the busy bushel basketful. Clapton once said that the whiteman's contribution to the blues was the seventeen minute guitar solo. Jonny should take note. More is less. Like anything this cheesey, he needs a lot more time to develop. Let us pray."
2,Average,I Prefered His First Disc over this one hands down.The Playing didn't feel as Raw&Solid as the Debut.He has Talent but The Production here Forces Him Into Styles that He Can't Feel just yet.PRINCE CO-Wrote I Am it would interesting too see those two trading Licks.they have One thing in Common they both Started out at the same age.but Prince Found Himself will LANG do Likewise on his Next Release? Prince did on Dirty Mind.also they are both from the same State.
2,JONNY SHOULD HAVE STUCK TO WHAT WORKED FOR HIM!,"IF YOUR LOOKING FOR THE SAME SOUND AS THE LIE TO ME CD ( HARD ROCKIN BLUES ) IT AINT HERE MAN. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A COUPLE OF NOTABLE TRACKS THIS IS NOT THE JONNY LANG YOU WOULD BE EXPECTING. THERE IS TOO MUCH FUNK HERE TO BE BLUES AND FOR THE MOST PART, THIS WILL NOT APPEAL TO AN OLD ROCK BLUES FAN. IE: STONES / CCR SKIP THIS ONE AND WAIT JONNY WILL RETURN TO US."
2,"Bring back ""The Kid""","After ""Lie To Me"", I thought I would buy anything this artist put out. 3 albums later, I'm regretting that decision. It started with this title. Did that trip to Memphis make him think he's Al Green? Did his guitar fall down and it can't get up? Is he only a 6 string stud in the studio with a lot of help from the engineers and timed tracking? I honestly don't get it. As utterly IMPRESSIVE and AMAZING as ""Lie"" was, subsequent releases have only put me to sleep. Forced blue-eyed soul ain't doing it for me. Stax/Volt is out of business and the Staple Singers aren't holding auditions. I don't want to be unkind because anyone who can cut the very best version of ""Matchbox"" will always have a home in my heart but in the words of the immortal Frank Zappa, ""Shut Up and Play Your Guitar""."
1,This ain't it,"It's too bad ""real"" blues artist's such as Buddy Guy don't get the same buzz as this long haired guy with a strat Johnny come lately gets. This sucks and if you get it you're doing a disservice to the real purveyor's of blues who have paid their dues dearly."
5,"ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY MOST OUTSTANDING","HAVING JUST HEARD JOHNNY LANG LIVE AT SOLDIESRS & SAILORS HALL IN PITTSBURGH,PA, I MUST SAY WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT THIS GENTLEMAN IS TRUELY OUTSTANDING. I ONLY WONDER WHAT HE WILL BE LIKE IN 20 YEARS! I HAVE BOTH OF HIS CD's AND I AM AMAZED! I AM ONE OF HIS TRUE FANS!"
5,LEGEND IN THE MAKING,"JONNY LANG, YOUNG BUT NOT WITH OUT EXPERIENCE. HE SINGS AS THOUGH HE'S 100 YEARS OLD AND BORN IN THE BACK WOODS OF MISSISSIPPI. IF YOU LOVE THE BLUES YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK OUT THIS GUY. HE'S BEEN COMPARED TO STEVIE RAY AND B.B. KING, BUT THIS KID IS IN A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN"
4,This kid sounds like Joe Cocker at his best!,"Gravelly voiced beyond his years, I can't get over how similar Lang sounds to Joe Cocker when belting out the blues. This collection is ""classic Cocker"" complete with strong bass, a rich full sound of backup singers, and a few good guitar riffs for effect. If you like Cocker, this disk is worth a listen!"
4,Jonny spreads his wings.,"Jonny Lang has come back at us breaking from the blues genre and venturing off into funk and rock. I am for the most part a die hard blues fan and was somewhat ""shocked"" when I first listenedto this cd. What I had to keep in mind was the artistic value of what Jonny hasdone. Jonny has spread his wings. I admire a musician that has the talent and guts to search new avenues of expression, and he does it very well in this release. At 17, he has accomplished more than many. His ""Joe Cocker"" style voice is sounding better and getting stronger with every release.These songs all tell a story. They all hold a message. A hard core blues fan may not care for this cd, but listen to it for what it is. It is music from a great young musician with a bright future."
4,Another fun novel,This is another fun novel by Charlaine Harris staring the librarian with loads of money in a little town in Georgia.
3,"Good, but confusing","This book was more like a crazed bunch of events than a deep book. If you're looking for romantic stories that are complicated and intertwined, or deep questionings about sexuality and the meanings of love, don't read this book. Its crazy and fun, almost too realistic, but at the same time surreal and make-believe. It leaves more questions than answers, but Pretty Things is a fun book to pick up and enjoy just because it's so deranged"
2,Pretty Things Ain't So Pretty,"Nah. I wasn't a fan of the book. I thought it would be more interesting and funnier, but it just pissed me off. The plot was very thin, the only real resolution was Brie gaining convidence. The only thing that happened over the course of the novel was that all the teens managed to get really drunk, sleep with each other, and get really really angry at one another. Half the book was just the characters complaining and using a lot of bad language. It didn't bring about any earth-shattering realizations about homosexuals, and made it seem that one can choose their sexuality. There are better books than this one, and I don't recommend it.But if you did read this book and enjoyed it, you might want to try Guitar Girl by the same author."
5,Brilliant Overview of Jefferson's Philosophy,"Professor Koch performs a valuable service in this book. She shows how Thomas Jefferson had a coherent philosophy in contrast to those who maintain that he was devoid of one. Koch relates how Jefferson studied religion, republicanism, natural rights, philology, ideology, education, philosophy, etc. She shows how Jefferson had voracious appetite for learning not just what we do, but why. He was a student of Bacon,Locke, and a later follower of De Tracy, Stewart, and Say. Koch shhows Jefferson's belief in human progress and improvability were cornerstones of Jefferson's belief system. Overall a wonderful book."
5,Makes you appreciate America even more.....,"There are many great books on life in Communist China...Wild Swans, Life and Death in Shanghai, Mandate of Heaven, Iron and Silk etc.....Confessions is a great addition to the field.Well translated and utterly captivating and scary. A look into the horrors of life under Mao's totalitarianism.Some guys might be put off from Life and Death in Shanghai or Wild Swans which are told from very strong female points of view....Confessions is from a males point of view...I am not saying the other books are chick books and this is a guys book...but to some who might not want to read about generations of females this is a good alternative.Its a great book and I hope it reaches a wide group of readers."
3,Raymond video,"Ok, saw alot of the stories on TV. Fun to watch the reruns again. Raymond is so funny and the stories will keep you in stitches, To think there will be no more."
2,Disappointing so far,"I'm only through the first of the three CD's, but so far I'm not impressed; I wish I'd bought their Phrase Book/CD instead... Unlike Berlitz's phrase books, which are information-rich, the first CD is largely filler, and only 60 minutes, so the three CD's should really have been at most two, and perhaps only one. It's also presented as being new (August 2002), but there's considerable emphasis on the Lira, and no mention of the Euro."
2,splinters and a hard to remove sticker,"The stick is sturdy enough, but had some splinters, and the hard to remove sticker with a ""cancerous materials"" warning was disconcerting. I don't particularly like the feel of the paint job either."
2,O.K. for medium to small canine but not a very large dog.,"This vest seemed sturdy enough and the straps adjusted well to my dog's girth, but the zipper was a disappointment, being rather likely to unravel when you pulled your pet up to lift him or her.My dog is approimately 127 lbs. and when I tried it on her and lifted her, the stitching around the zipper looked as if it would break if I did this manuver a few more times, especially in the water. The stitching needs better reinforcement.I would recommed it for a dog no more than 80 lbs. tops, if you are going to fish your very large pup in and out of the water many times. (Although it will keep your dog safe and afloat and seen in an emergency, so that is a plus in its favor.)"
5,Choral Collection Exquisite!,"This longstanding Anglican choir melds their voices superbly in wide-ranging group of composers spanning nearly five-hundred years, and representing serious church, choir compositions from the likes of Bach to Faure to Rachmaninov.Haunting in their beauty and strength are the contribution by Gorecki ""Totus Tuus"" with its Russian sounding harmony and minimalist composition, and Tavener's ""The Lamb"" with its chant like quality bringing forth in the listener meditation and contemplation.Worthy of repeated listening!"
4,Author's Comment,"This dictionary is primarily for student pilots who do not have English as a first language. The headwords and context sentences are taken from a 250,000 word corpus of flying training texts. The book is designed to fill the gap between a general English dictionary for students of English and an aeronautical dictionary for native English speakers."
5,long lasting trimmer,I bought this trimmer about 8 years ago or so. I cannot get it to quit running no matter how hard I abuse it. I don't have the time or energy for any type of preventative maintenance so it just gets a bit of gas/oil. I decided I wanted straight shaft trimmer about 3 years ago but cannot get this one to die!
1,"Broke in half, never started and idled well. Typical Chinese junk","It has never started and idled well. Plug is clean, gas is good. Cheap plastic tang holding shaft onto motor broke on one side. NOT recommended. Spend for a more highly rated machine."
2,Hard to start and stalls out once running.,"First time I bought a curved shaft trimmer, my old one crapped out on me so I needed a new one and saw this one on sale for around 66 dollars so I bought it. When I got it it already came assembled so all I had to do was put in the 2 cycle gas. After that I tried to start the trimmer as instructed, it took around 2-3 minutes to get it started, and once it was started and I started using it, the trimmer kept stalling on me. It must of stalled around 9-10 times trying to trim the house and the fence. Even though it stalled that many times, it still did the job it was intended to do, don't know if I received a bad weed eater or not, but I wasn't going to order the same model or brand again, I would try a brand I was accustomed too. After I was finished, I packed the machine up and sent in back to Amazon, and I orderd a more expensive one, and I'm glad I did."
3,"Weed Eater 17-Inch 25cc Gas-Powered String Trimmer, Curved Shaft #XT260","It began, out of the box, fine; however, as another reviewer wrote, it stalls and is difficult to restart."
3,Pretty good space opera,"The story is reminiscent of the Alien films. Deep space exploration crew encounters alien life form that takes over. Hero escapes in a lifeboat. Months later, she is rescued. The company she works for sends her back to bring home some of the life forms."
5,Great!,"This riveting story tells of Eveningstar Macaw, a Mayan girl in the ninth century. While Eveningstar is in the jungle, she sees the Maya's enemies, the Savages. (Her relationship with one of them, Small-Shield, blossoms into a love.) She runs to her brother, a warrior, and he captures them. Later the city begins to fall to ruin under the rule of Great Skull Zero, the high priest. He sacrifices her beloved brother. When Eveningstar resists, he captures. She must find courage to save her city, her family, and herself from Great Skull Zero."
2,Crappy discs?,"I was so excited to receive Season 6 on DVD! When it arrived and I tried playing the first disc, you could not rewind to watch a scene again, the disc stuttered and wouldn't play, and just combined for an overall bad experience."
4,Not Bad...,"NCIS is one of the worlds most watched shows and the sixth season adds to this phenomenon. Michael Weatherly and Mark Harmon head up the elite team of Naval Investigators, along with Cote de Pablo, Sean Murray, Pauley Perrette and David McCallum. Rocky Carroll also joins the main cast this season as Director Leon Vance, a role he also plays on the new spin-off ""NCIS Los Angeles"", Vance took over the reins of NCIS from Director Jennifer Shepard who was killed in the Season 5 Finale. Vance has not added much to this show, and in fact has taken some of the viewing pleasure, hence the loss of a ""star"".Chris O'Donnell, LL Cool J, Peter Cambor, Barrett Foa and Louise Lombard also appear this season as their ""NCIS: Los Angeles"" Characters, although Lombard does not appear in the new series."
4,NCIS: The sixth season.,"I love all the NCIS episodes, but was very disappointed to discover there are no sub-titles or closed captions in this one. Why do only some of the DVD's have them? My husband and I are quite hard of hearing and couldn't really enjoy this episode much because we couldn't understand a word they were saying. Please let the producer know that a lot more people would buy videos if they were sub-titled or closed captioned. Happy to see that the seventh season is sub-titled.by Carla P."
1,NCIC - 6,"I'm sure I would have enjoyed the DVD; unfortunately, it was never received. No explanation; no shipment. I received notice that the DVD was received and shipped on 9-16. Tracking the order indicated that it would be received by October 8. On October 14 I filed a claim. I've received credit.Not a pleasant experience.I still want the DVD, but will go elsewhere.Jeri"
1,Useless for anything but foam board,"The only use of this knife is for cutting 45-degree edges on foam board (and why anyone would want to do that is beyond me). It is totally useless for anything else, including the mat board that I bought it for. The minimal instructions and diagrams are equally worthless."
2,Disappointing Purchase,Didn't cut deep enough for my needs and didn't have an attachment to keep it even on 90 degree cuts as it does on 45 degree cuts.
1,Bait and Switch,"I ordered 26 inch rattan sticks that looked compacted, thin and sturdy and received 28 inch pieces of the worst rattan I've seen in 30 years of training with these sticks. Thick without any rings nodes that add strength and durability to the stick. I would have sent them back but they arrived right before I was giving a seminar and had to go with them. They dinged up so quickly I'm not sure how long they will last. I will remember the company that I bought these from and not make the same mistake twice."
3,Okay ring- not the best,"I bought this ring a few years back and still wear it every once in a while. It's a thick ring, sterling silver, although feels too light and doesn't quite have the same appearance of a normal sterling silver ring. The rope detail is not that great, and smudged and unclear in parts of the ring (which is hard to tell from the photo). It's an okay ring, but not the best quality in my opinion."
2,brings good points to table but seems highly unethical,"while this book was well written and thought out. for those of you who want to maintain honest relations with your intended target an their situation, i would take this book with a grain of salt. the impression i got from this book was not only target your friends by lying/seducing them, but encourage them to lie to their husbands and significant others. in the case of a hubands, a messy divoirce is bound to be left on your hands and i can't imagine your target will enjoy the situation you put her in.i also found it didn't look past this one encounter and it's ramnifications (see above for example), nor explained the possibility of polyamory versus swinging. however, i guess they felt that was for another book. in closing, it gets you where you want to be, but not enough information to know what you are getting into."
5,Best advice yet!,"I have read what other books are out there, but this one is the best by far. I am a woman experienced in threesomes, but I read the book because I wanted to learn how to help other women in their journey of being bisexual. The best advice of all is that friends make the best lovers - this is so true! I was thrilled to read a book that gave so many common sense ideas (but that even I was oblivious to). I won't give away any more of her ""secrets,"" but this really is a good book. It has totally changed my approach to women in general. [....]"
5,"Before Fegelein, there was Elizabeth Cole!","So, this concludes that both Lissie and her best friend Lizzie were bent at committing antics, just as Fegelein does in the Downfall parodies. Too bad this seemed to make things a little OOC for Cole, but at least this one's worth the laugh. Definitely a must-read for everyone."
3,pergamot is NOT quince,"pergamot is NOT quince...it is BERGAMOT - they do look somewhat similar in the picture on the label. Bergamot is a citrus, famous for flavoring earl gray tea. this product is probably very nice but seems overpriced. it can be added to marinades, muffins, bbq sauce, salad dressings...as well as spread on toast.quince is also wonderful flavor, but not citrus at all, more like apple."
3,"very good, unique","""Pergamot"" was translated for me as ""quince,"" so this is candied quince. The fruit is in a very thick sugar syrup which has little flavor itself. There is a very, very slight lemony aroma to the pergamot. The fruit itself is thick and in rather large chunks, which have an unfamiliar, almost crumbly, soft, and an unexpectedly dry texture. The taste is much more like lemons or citron than any other fruit, and is very mild. I would rate it is as ""good to very good,"" definitely a unique item, not just an unusual version of a familiar American item. It is something I am glad I tried but I think I would try many other items from the flood of Mediterranean preserved items available before I tried this one again."
5,This is what I call fantasy!,This series was recommended to me by somone I know.It's one of the best series' on earth!It has fantassy creatures from A to Z.It's interesting;it's exciting!I highly recommend it to any fantassy lover!I must admitt despite all this that the first book isn'nt the best.
1,This is a 5 star series?,"I really don't understand what people see in the Dragonlance Chronicles. Very weak story, boring characters AND poorly written. Yes, this is truly a classic of the genre.If you're over the age of 7, you may want to pass on this one.0 out of 5 stars"
5,The Dragonlance Chronicles,"This book is awesome! The most loveable and hatable characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I read the original hardcover book (the un-annotated chronicles) and unfortunately it was owned by an ex. I had to give it back. = ( I've been searching all over the web for this book, but it was impossible to get it in the hardcover with all the volumes in one book. Until now! Reading it now with the annotations of the authors is even better than the one I originally read so HA to my ex! I got the better version! I got the better version! One peice of advice though for the readers who never had the pleasure of reading the original... don't read the annotations until your second time reading it.. (and you WILL read it again), some of them give away what's to come."
3,"Great book, but hardly a classic","Hickman and Weis write a highly entertaining and exciting fantasy series, but they're works can hardly be compared to those of tolkein. While the excitement is nearly non-stop, most of the characters are poorly characterized with the exception of Raistlin. I have read it two or three times and greatly enjoy it, but the lack of depth makes it stop short of approaching the level of a classic. If you want to read a contemporary author who writes classic level books, try Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time series."
4,Great books,"Just had to say, great books. Much in the way of Lord of the Rings type of book and fantasy type.4 stars"
5,"For lovers of magic and steel, prepare to be spellbound.","This book represent the introduction to the world of Krynn. Krynn is a world rich in magic and meddling gods, those history has been shattered and forgotten. This trilogy represents the return of the gods to Krynn, as the Heroes of the Lance rediscover their Faith to battle the Dragon armies. This is an enchanting classic, those characters you will amuse and inspire."
4,Good,"This is a good game, but I have some peeves about it. The graphics and action are good. The multiplayer is fun. However, the up/down controls are way too sensitive (at least for an ""urban warfare"" paintballer). Not to mention that the fire is on R instead of A (like every other game). Otherwise, pretty good."
4,Medal of Honor Frontline definitely hits the mark...,"I would have given this game a five, but it's control keeps me from giving it the best score. But don't worry, you'll get used to it. Still, what it lacks in control, it makes up for in the overall game experience. Remember the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan? Don't worry, you'll get to experience it all over again in the opening sequence of Frontline...and if you have a nice surround sound system, all I can say is make sure you tell the neighbors before you play because the sound is beautiful. Bullets fly, bombs go off uncomfortably close and in the meantime your fellow soldiers are being blasted into oblivion. Alright, the graphics aren't the greatest but the game is sure to satisfy those who wan't a shooter and for all you WWII fans. One other negative would have to be the missions you are put in. It seems unrealistic that you would have to fend off entire squads of soldiers by yourself...but hey, it is a game."
4,War Time,"I like this game alot, it had a lot of action it this one. I rated this one a 5 on my list action games."
4,Hoffman contines to elude the recording world,"This is a very good Hoffman, with the new edition of the score and a lot more music than in earlier editions. There is MUCH here to be admired and enjoyed as there is in the classic Domingo/Sutherland recording.I prefer Domingo's more passionate Hoffman to Alagna's workmanlike effort, which is still quite fine.On the other hand, having different female vocalists, as this recording does is preferable to my ear than having the same throughout as the Domingo/Sutherland recording does. The three female leads here range from good (Dessay) to excellent (Jo). Having heard Sumi Jo sing Olympia on record and in person, I find it hard to enjoy Dessay's quite as much. Jo is here as Antonia however.No single recording of Hoffman is clearly preferable and listening to each is recommended. In the meanwhile, there is still an opening here for a more fully satisying Hoffman."
2,tipical ravenwolf,"This is yet another bookby Llewellyn which rehashes the same gunk that the others do, this time it is explained in terms of the pow wow practice. Wiccans like revenwolf seem to think that any practice dealing with any kind of herbal medicines or folk tradition is wiccan...ITS NOT!!!!....Wicca is a neo modern religion with absolutely NO roots what so ever except that it claims to stem from old religion. If you are looking for pow wow practice read ""the Long Lost Friend""....If you want witchcraft, not wicca, but witchcraft which is entirely different, I suggest Mastering Witchcraft by Paul Huson."
5,Great book,What a find. I saw this book at a bookstore in St Louis but didn't get it at the time. I'm so glad it was available used on Amazon. A nice hardcover book with some great photos of the city. There are books like this for other cities (for ex New Orleans) so it's well worth purchasing if you have an interest.Kevin Cuccia
1,Oprah's A Big Disappointment,"After seeing most of the 1st two episodes on Discovery, I was so disappointed with the narration and writing of this series that I've decided not to watch anymore. The narration was just so silly that I even attempted to watch it while muting the sound but as good as the filming was, I finally just turned it off. It wasn't until I started reading the reviews on Amazon that I found out that David Attenborough did the original narration for ""Life"" and that they rewrote it especially for Oprah's U.S. release of the series. What the hell were they thinking? I will NOT watch another episode on Discovery channel, but instead, I too will be purchasing the David Attenborough version."
4,Breathtaking Visuals,"The quality of the film taken for this series is absolutely astounding. I have never seen such amazing shots, even after having seen Planet Earth. While the content has not gripped me nearly as well as Planet Earth, watching this series on Blu-Ray certainly makes up for the not-as-strong content.I also highly recommend the narration by David Attenborough as opposed to Oprah Winfrey. Oprah is a fine person, to be sure, but David Attenborough has been at this for ages, and his experience makes the commentary shine."
1,BBC knows - Why change what's perfect?,"Why on earth have they decided to dub the documentary into American English baffles me. Is British English appallingly obscure and incomprehensible?First Harry Potter and now this. What a shameful way to undermine language for the sake of a couple of bucks?I have various BBC Documentaries - I LOVE them, and despite the fact that I am not British I understand everything, and David Attenborough's voice in much more credible, isn't this what he does professionally?Oprah would probably be more suitable for bedtime story recordings for sleepy youngsters.I suggest getting the original David Attenborough version (Check the star rating and compare!)"
1,"Once again, hijacked","Why on Earth would you want to listen to a reality talk show (if you can even call it that) queen talk about things far removed from her forte? Over the decades, my family and I have watched all of Sir David Attenborough's nature video series (I still have some in VHS version, lol) and what makes his version vastly superior to Oprah Winfrey's attempt is--to put it bluntly and and simply--the man's world of knowledge and the infectious enthusiasm he has for the subject. As for why Winfrey was chosen...? Your guess is as good as mine. But like they say...a sucker's born every minute."
1,lame & unfortunate DISCOVERY rewrite,"This is a horrible dumbing down of a great BBC doc series. If you compare this DISCOVERY channel version with the excellent BBC version, you will notice that most all the science and particularly mentions of evolution have been removed. That's what's really going on here. A producer friend told me that shows are no longer allowed to use the words EVOLUTION or EVOLVED on Discovery Channel or Discovery Science Channel. That's the main thing that is really going on here with the Discovery re-scripting of this originally 5 star program, that reduces it to negative star status. I wish I could give it less than one star."
1,Very disappointed with Winfrey's narration and content,"I watched a few episodes of ""Life"" on TV and was disappointed with both Oprah Winfrey's narration, which lacked any real informational content and was delivered in such a monotone voice that I could hardly stand to listen to her, and the content seemed to be a rehash of several other nature documentaries I have seen over the years. The cinematography was its only saving grace."
2,Don't Buy the Oprah Dumbed Down Version,"This documentary series is a feast for your eyes. David Attenborough narration is much more intelligent and entertaining than Oprah's dumb downed version. Mr. Attenborough gives a narration that is both pleasant to listen to and informative. Oprah explains things with juvinile comments and comes across with sense of false enthusiasm. She will explain a lizards mating habits by saying ""look him get it on."" Her narration was so bad that my wife and stopped watching Life when it was presented on Discovery Channel. As Great for introducing your children to conservation and science."
3,"Visually stunning videos, but somewhat boring narrative","Like my title suggests, the videos looked awesome, but I found the informational content boring. I feel like the narrative jumped around too much from scene to scene. The content from the 1st disk was reused in subsequent disks, so it may be repetitive watching those sections again. I think the most interesting parts were the behind-the-scenes clips. Overall, I think Planet Earth was more entertaining to watch"
1,This is criminal,"The decision to use Oprah as a narrator to replace David Attenborough was a crime. He's the perfect spokesperson and has the history and experience to back it up. Do your self a favor and look for the David Attenborough version, and avoid this one."
3,Meh,"Buy Planet Earth instead. This one is desent, but I was expecting it to be as good as Planet Earth. I wasnt holding my attention for very long as I watched it. I recommend this if you havent seen Planet Earth. Then when you are done go watch Planet Earth and Human Planet. If you have seen those then borrow this or rent it, dont buy it."
1,The worst narration ever!,"I would love to watch this series with no narration instead of Oprah. How can one person take a stunning work of photography and life and turn it into something that is irritating to listen to. What a horrible mistake , I will get the BBC version."
1,"Oprah as a naturalist, absurdity at its finest",Oprah does not belong within the province of the naturalist documentary--she has absolutely no credibility in such a venue and has essentially destroyed the series with her pathetic attempt at narration. Buy the Attenborough edition and don't look back!
1,A good idea gone bad,"Despite the fact that Oprah is a horrendous narrator - I absolutely agree with the other reviewers on this point - the series itself did not live up to expectations. They repeated several sequences in more than one episode! With all the ""Life"" that there is in the world, it seems completely absurd that they show the same animals performing the same behaviors in different episodes. Additionally, some of the shots are computer generated. Again, we're supposed to be seeing Life here, not a representation of it. It definitely did not live up to the extremely high bar that Planet Earth set, and I would recommend waiting until this is really cheap to buy on DVD - and definitely the David Attenborough version!"
1,Awful narrator. Buy the BBC version,"Oprah as narrator for this series must be the single most colossal blunder in the history of television. As virtually everyone else here has said, it is an excellent documentary, but get the British version narrated by Sir David instead."
1,"Good lord, why on earth did they choose Oprah!",Do yourself a favor: buy the version narrated by David Attenborough atLife (narrated by David Attenborough) [Blu-ray]. The man injects an infectious enthusiasm into his shows. I could never understand why Discovery Channel insists on hiring American actors to do the narration.
1,Do not buy this version,"Do not buy this version. That's it plain and simple. Go get the original David Attenborough narrated version. Oprah makes this ""Americanized"" version totally unwatchable."
4,Another great nature documentary DVD from BBC,"This is another great nature documentary from BBC, along the lines of the famous ""Planet Earth"" DVD. David Attenborough narrates in this version, but beware of another version narrated by Oprah Winfrey as it is more for kiddies. The filming of the scenes is absolutely awesome!"
5,Attenborough's commentary is first rate,The pictures are incredible and David Attenborough's commentary is intelligent and detailed unlike the version with Oprah Winfrey.
1,Why not Marta Stewart?,"Really, why not Marta Stewart or Tiger Woods? There is so many famous and wonderful folks in America, why this morons choosed oprah? To sell more? Sorry I'm russian and I'm not in oprah fanclub, I cannot care less about her remarkable achievement in entertainment biz.Just people please keep those mcdonalds guys away from nature, documentary or anything with planet earth in it. By the way Sigourney Weaver was cool in Avatar and Aliens, but this is our planet.David Attenborough is the guy. Many people said that to listen to oprah like to listen bedtime story, sorry but I still would rather listen bedtime stories narrated by David Attenborough."
1,Seriously?,"I was so excited to watch the life premier tonight at 8... and about 5 minutes into it I definitely changed the channel because idk about you but how is OPRAH WINFREY qualified to narrate this great collection??? What a disappointment, can't wait to buy the dvd narrated by Sir David Attenborough!"
5,Terrific Series about Life Narrated by David Attenborough.,"LIfe is a wonderful show depicting life in many forms, mammals, insects, birds, reptiles and amphibians as well as subjects as creatures of the deep without backbones and predator and prey. This series not only taught me about life around the planet but also some extraordinary animals and plants I barely knew anything about. The photography is stunning and in bluray was brilliant. The narration by David Attenborough was clear and easily understood. I did have to wonder at times as I heard the British pronunciation of some words but it didn't prevent my comprehension, it broadened my knowledge of how we differ, just another part of life! I really enjoyed the series and learned a lot. My memories of chimps, Komodo Dragons and water buffalos are still with me. After each episode, a 10 minute short explains how the most difficult sequences were filmed. A very valuable exercise which made me wish I was there to do it too. Great series."
1,skip this version,"Inferior picture quality and inferior delivery from Oprah make this one a pass.Do not pass go, go directly to the UK version of this."
3,"5 stars for picture, 2 stars for narration","I bought this because it was on sale for amazingly cheep, not knowing there was a different narrator from the original BBC series.The cinematography in Life is just as incredible as the work done on Earth. The picture is seems like a window and it feels like I have been transported to the locations I am witnessing.However, Oprah is speciesist, horribly horribly speciesist. Oprah says time and again that mammals are the only animals that care for each other and live in social groupings even though on other discs we see amphibians and reptiles, insects and fish exhibiting behavior that ""only mammals"" are capable of.That said, I bout it for the cinematography, so I tend to just mute the sound and throw on some music anyway."
1,Get the UK version instead!,This US version features narration by Oprah Winfrey. Go for the superior UK version instead with narration by David Attenborough. He also narrated the UK version of BBC's series Planet Earth. Amazon also sells the David Attenborough version.
1,What were they thinking?,"It is simply incomprehensible why The Discovery Channel felt they had to remove the excellent narration by David Attenborough and replace it with a dumbed-down script narrated cloyingly by, of all people, Oprah Winfrey. Do they think that their target audience is preschoolers?If you wonder why the US is falling behind other nations in certain academic fields, you have only to consider the thought process that led to creating this travesty. Shame, shame, shame, Discovery Channel."
4,Feedback,The deal was great.....The product came in a timely fashion and the quality of the package was exellent. All around I would say that this was a good buy!
1,Agreed on the Oprah Version,"No offence to Ms. Winfrey, but this version is decidedly inferior to the BBC release. It has 110 less minutes of content and less serious and intelligent narration."
1,It's Not Just Oprah....,"Am I the only one seeing repeated footage? Seriously!I counted 3 times that they showed the fox chase the deer up the cliff.The dolphins making cloudy circles at least twice.And I'm not talking about short snippets, I'm talking full scene repeats (with different dialogue).This is a sly way of making 11 episodes out of footage for 10.Oprah is slack as well (I liked Mrs. Weaver much better)David Attenborough is THE MAN!"
1,Ugggh,Just another resounding damnation of this version. I tried sitting through one episode on discovery and promptly switched channels. Why ruin the experience?
4,I love Tracey!,"I love Tracey and Scyther, so this is my fave book out of the series. They're all well-written, and kids shold enjoy them LONG after Pokemon's popularity is over. They teach morals and friendship in a fun way."
4,Home James,"I like driving when I travel and I thought the Tom Tom was the perfect thing to help me find my way. I was not disappointed. Very true to form and easy to use. I had one problem with the 510 however, after 4 months of use it just died. The makers sent me a new version which is just as good if not better but it makes me a bit weary that the same might happen with this version - however it does not rely on a flash card like the last one.In any event the new one has been working fine and I love it and the whole idea. It has helped me to find restaurants and my way home from them. Really cool. I would give it 5 stars but the first issue causes me to give it 4."
3,Not the worst investment,"Caveats abound with this mostly okay navigator. First, don't trust that it knows which restaurants and points of interest are still open or closed. Second, in areas with lots of recent road development, don't expect TomTom to be aware that what it thinks is farmland was just recently paved over. Thrid, the voice keeps cutting out on us lately, and if we're not paying attention to the screen, there's no guarantee we'll be warned to take the next exit. We've had to backtrack at least five times based on this machine's faulty instructions. I think it's a much better tool to use when planning ahead of time (while you're on a long stretch of road) as to where you're going next than relying on the step-by-step instructions."
3,Too Euro,"This GPS is really outdated, in my opinion, even with the lastest maps. It is too European and not North American, referring to Interstates as motorways. Very slow with entance and exit ramp directions. Not much voice response for directions. Had to stop often to ""look"" at screen. It is OK in familiar areas but traveling, I needed an Atlas because of incorrect routes.Called in many map corrections and never got a call back. POI's are very limited, no Menards?Called to get ""Plus"" for traffic alerts, not available in USA. Customer Service not much help, said I was the ""only"" negative call they received. Screen Size is a plus. So sad cause I thought I researched before purchase."
1,Bad Product,The Tom-Tom 510 has 2 mounts. Neither of them would function as designed. I returned it for a refund.
2,Rockport Deck Shoe,"I was hoping that this was the retooled ""original"" Rockport premium deck shoe which was the most comfortable and rugged deck shoe that I have ever worn. It looked the same in the photographs, even the tread was very similar. Unfortunately, upon receiving the shoes, inspecting them, and wearing them, they were far inferior to the original quality. I had no choice but to return them for a refund."
1,Mobi Thermometer sucks,"Well we bought this thermometer and it really sucks.My peice of advice is never buy this, it shows variant temperatures and when we contacted Customer Service they asked us to re-calibrate the thermometer. Really is this Space Shuttle to recalibrate. We asked them to send a new one and they said NO in exchange for this.They suck, and this thermometer sucks.If you want peice of mind without false readings do not buy this. I will not tell you what to buy but I will tell you do not buy this peice of junk."
1,More of a hassel.,I bought this on a whim and and now I know why I love reading reviews and value their input. I wish I would have read about this thermometer. It does not read the same temp. from using any of the different methods. It also does not read the same temp. when I use one method and test mine or the babies temp. a few times in a row.
5,Great for an active toddler,"We've had this thermometer for the past two years, and I love it! It is SO easy to use and I can even take my daughter's temperature while she's sleeping.I'm surprised at all the negative reviews! I think there are two things to keep in mind. The thermometer needs to be kept in the room where you plan to use it. And, I do have to add a degree to the reading it gives me, but I don't find that problematic because it's always consistent in being a degree lower.I'm not sure why other reviewers are getting inconsistent readings. If I take my daughter's (or my own) temperature at the same spot on her forehead, I get the same reading."
5,perfect for my needs,"This towel rack was big enough for what we needed and fits the bill perfectly. Finish is nice and it looks good up. Installed by me...all thumbs, anybody could do it!"
4,"Good chain, don't buy the tensioners",The chains themselves are fine and fit my Prius. But the bundled offer with rubber tensioners is worthless. The package says not to use tensioners with these chains. SO DON'T BUY THE CHAIN TENSIONERS!
3,Tire bungie,"Didn't need them but will keep for another day. The chain set in the directions warned to not use these, so maybe I will find another use for them. Look like a very good quality item."
5,Cover,This book is great !I had to buy this again because I lost my first one .. This one is a must have !
3,missing the most important recipe,"We bought this primarily because we had read that it had the recipe for tortilla soup and also because we hoped that it would have a recipe for their salsa. Unfortunately, it has neither. That being said, it's still a half way decent cookbook, and was pretty cheap."
1,Chevys Freshmex Cookbook,I bought this book because it said it has tortilla soup receipe. LIE LIE Lie!!!!!! FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!!!!! I'm returning the book !!!!!!!!
2,Not very satisfied,I have been using this cookbook for years with my mom and we both love it so I ordered it as a Christmas present. The book came with a page ripped out. I would not order again.
5,Gift,My 10 year old godson loved it! He's been watching history of Titanic movies like crazy and this hit the nail on the head
2,Passengers From Haiti,The book should be redone to include the Laroche family from Haiti. They wasn't on the list of country that was on Titanic.
1,Not usefull at all.,"I presumed, that I would be able to find thousands verbs that start from lee... (infinitive), but found just no more then 50-60. I was unable to find such words, like ""leerdof"", ""leez'of"", ""leez'om"", and hundred others. I was able to find ""leerdof"" only from another part of book, when I was looking for tranlsation of english word ""follow"".I believe this book is very unusefull for anyone."
4,Great Toy for Travel!,"My 3-year-old daughter has all four of these Dora ""surprise"" playsets - Ice Cream, Fiesta, School Day, and First Prize Pony. They're great for the car or anywhere she needs a little distraction.Cute, durable toy ideal for encouraging pretend play."
4,A real classic - collector's item,"If you can still get your hands on this one, do it. This features Jerry at his younger comedian days along with the talented crews at Saturday Night Live. See how his nothingness evolved into His Royal Nothingness."
4,Great Young Guitar Hero,"Derek Trucks works as a guitarist with the Allman Brothers Band, but he also has his own band, and in addition, he is married to contemporary blues great Susan Tedeschi, who often tours with him.On this CD, he shows off his prodigious guitar playing on such good cuts as Preaching Blues, Ain't That Lovin You, and Young Funk. He doesn't sing, but has vocalists with him that are more than capable of handling the materials.With songs that range from blues to rock to funk, Trucks is claiming territory for his generation presided over by such veteran guitarists as Jeff Beck and Steve Morse. This is the beginning of a great talent worth watching in the years to come."
2,"Great player, poor tune selector",THere is absolutely no doubt that Trucks can slide and bend with the best of them. His playing is by no means to be taken lightly. But his writing skills and song selection leaves a LOT of room for improvement. Give him a few more years and he will produce a classic. But not this time.
3,it's okay,"This product is probably better suited for turtles and frogs. Some fish may like it. My fish could care less. When the fish are hanging around the top of the tank, especially while feeding, they may pass through it just to get to the other side...meaning they go through it because that is easier than swimming around it or under it at the moment. Otherwise they ignore it. Am going to try it in another tank with a different type of fish and see how they react to it."
5,my cichlids and red claw crabs love it!,"this thing does what its supposed to do. You put it in and it floats. yeah the first day that it was in there the fish weren't familiar with it so they largely ignored it, but then once they saw what it was, there is always at least one cichlid in the log at all times. Then my little red claw crabs will climb into the log via a plant, and will come in there and scare the cichlids out of the log so they could chill in there. My shrimp that I use as food for my cichlids like posting up on the outside of the log too, and on the few rare instances when there are no fish in the log, they will go inside of it too. My guppies don't really like hanging out by the floating log, but I don't care as they're all gonna get eaten soon enough by my vicious cichlids. haha, and for the person who bought a floating log for their pet guppy, you have your priorities all wrong. haha."
4,A nice twist on the monster genre,"The Craving is a nifty little horror film full of the elements you expect from this genre: attractive young people, a desolate and frightening setting (in this case, a genuinely creepy shack out in the desert), and a mysterious creature bent on ripping the protagonists to shreds. But filmmakers Sean Dillon and Curtis Krick have added an unexpected twist to the otherwise familiar tale: their monster, a chupacabra-like lizard creature, addicts its prey with -- well, I don't want to give anything away. Let's just say it's a fresh element that reinvigorates the monster movie genre. I've seen a LOT of horror films, both good and bad, over the years, and The Craving is much more entertaining than many of its big budget brethren."
2,Birthday review,"The product arrive promptly and was attractive. However, my daughter was disappointed that there was no chocolate. It was not worth the expense."
4,"Wild, dark ride.","Sakamoto has done it again--and completely differently. Fresh from his stirring (and underrated) Snake Eyes score, he has come up with this fascinating soundtrack that is both beautiful and frightening. Not for the faint of heart nor for those who don't care for electronica."
3,Mixed feelings,"Bought from Amazon for 420 Dollars 3 Months ago. Mixed feeling about this watch.Pros:+ Nice look+ Saphire glass really shows to be scratch resistant so far+ Good readability (though not in darkness - no light sourse in the watch)+ A nice addition to dressing smart - a man's response to ladies' jewelryCons:- Not too good in time keeping(quite a shock for me - I have not expected anything like that from Tissot at this price level)- In one day it can go wrong by 20 seconds - I can't remember a watch (or even an alarm clock) performing that bad in its primary function since my childhood (Is this only my piece or do of them perform like this?)- As some other reviewers pointed out the crown is so big, that it really can cause problems occasionally- The metal watchstrap not very comfortable - its width seems not in ballance with size and weigth of the watch itself"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This book is a TERRIBLE resource! It is full of spelling and grammatical errors - the authors even refer to ""Jane Austin"" MORE THAN ONCE. There is a practice test in the back of the book, but there are no explanations given for why answers are correct. That would be very helpful, as I believe several ""correct"" answers were wrong. If you're studying for the Praxis, you're better off getting a study guide from ETS instead."
4,diffrent and intresting,this is a new way to read books i like the consept very well done and original in many ways
4,"Great fun, though musically uneven.","I first heard this many years ago from a Finnish friend and eventually purchased it during a visit to Finland. The concept of the album is great: the audacity of wacky/cheesy comic-rockers Leningrad Cowboys putting together a concert with the Red Army choir and the amazing fact the they could pull it together, presumably in the cash-strapped wake of the collapsed Soviet Union. Most of the music is good too; it certainly is a thrill to hear the large choir on ""It's only rock 'n' roll"" and ""Sweet home Alabama."" The traditional Russion folk segments are also good. However, it does get a little tired after a while, in part due to the fact that the lead singer of the Cowboys is not really very good, and in part due to the fluffy nature of some of the material, like ""Happy together."" I would have been satisfied with a single CD of the best material. But all in all, it's a lot of fun."
2,What is all the hype about?,"I purchased this CD on the basis of the reviews written on Amazon. I have to say I am terribly disappointed. My son hates the CD, I listened to it and I am not all that impressed either. It is ok but nothing like described by other users."
5,My daughter loves this toy,"At 6 months, this is my daughter's favorite toy. She will actually play with this thing for longer than any other toy she has right now. She loves both sides and the ribbons that hang off."
4,Tiny Love Double-Sided First Book,"Pictures are in black and white on one side, color on the other. Attaches easily to crib or pack n play. Easily catches attention of newborn and older."
1,Something's amiss,"The recipes sound good, but I've tried half a dozen of them, and they've all turned out really BAD!"
3,High calories,"I just received this book and the receipes do sound delicious, but I am surprised to see how high in calories the servings are. Although I'm doing low-carb, I want to try to keep the calories in a reasonable range and these recipes see quite high."
2,"OK for loosing weight by eating low carb, but not for a low carb weight maintenence (also called Low Carb Lifestyle)",I thought a slow cooker low carb cookbook would be just what I wanted. I was looking for a book for Living Low Carb. I think she wrote one for lossing weight with low carb. That's a fine. But what anyone who has gone on a low carb diet knows is the really difficulty is learning to live low carb so you can keep the weight off. That's the challenge and that's a place where Live Style cookbooks are so rare and such a blessing. It is challenging to turn your back on so many fabulous and traditional recipes that you have enjoyed all your life.
4,Good Book,"The shipping was quick and the book was in great/new condition. The recipes are great, however we just couldn't stick to it and make that kind of life style change."
1,Great Resource for Low Carb Dieters,I've only had this cookbook for a few weeks but already I've tried two of the recipes and really liked them. I especially like the fact that the carb count is included for each recipe so I feel more comfortable about what I'm eating.Audrey
3,okay book,good reference book and many recipes I have tried. Also has many more recipes that I will be trying this winter.
3,"Watch out, you need an additional adapter!","I bought this lens kit taking for granted that it would fit my Kodak DX4530, but when I got it, I realized that I need an additional adapter, not included in the kit, with a US$20 value. What an ugly surprise. So be sure that you have the extra adapter."
3,"Watch out, you need an additional adapter!","January 12, 2006I bought this lens kit taking for granted that it would fit my Kodak DX4330, but when I got it, I realized that I need an additional adapter,kodak item #8776585, not included in the kit with a US$20 value. What an ugly surprise. So be sure that you have the extra adapter."
2,Wait a bit...,"Right now, lag predominates. Sometimes you press X (sit) and wait a good 30 seconds before your character sits. This looks like it has the potential to be a *great* game. Potential is future, not current. Wait 3-6 months if you are thinking about getting it. It should be fixed by then. A quick perusal of their message boards ... should warn you of the numerous issues this game faces. For support, this game has hit an all time low - no phone support. E-mails get answered with automated responses requesting you go to the main boards - where employees of Funcom rarely post."
1,This was not ready for release.,"It has stunning graphics and some great game ideas. It is just to bad that it was released this early. Wait on this game, in a couple months it will be great."
2,More Beta that Finished Version,"While the game can be fun, there are still numerous bugs including serious server instability. Timeouts frequently occur and you lose experience points and have to ""restart"" from where the server remembers you were. The longest I have been able to play is 20 minutes before getting a disconnect. There is also a lot of difficulty moving between zones. If I hadn't already purchased the game, I would wait a few weeks to make sure that Funcom gets the game working properly before considering this game. If they can get the bugs fixed, it will be a really fun game....."
3,Wait a month to buy,"I've played the beta for a while. I'll keep this short. Don't buy the game for at least 20-30 days. It has a lot of bugs to work out. The game crashed every 5 minutes or so and clipping planes are messed up. Walls seem to grow out toward you from the distance. I know it's only beta but this stuff should have been fixed before going live. As it is now, it's not even up to ""release candidate"" status. Give it 20 days or so. Read the message boards on aovault.stratics.com. When the posts die down about problems then consider getting it.FYI - When creating a character to change levels and go through the process you are supposed to click on an orange arrow. On my system this arrow is not visible unless you are directly in front of it and in first person view. It took me almost 30 minutes to create my character because I was in 3rd person view. Dunno if this is another bug or not but it might save you some aggrevation."
1,"Serious Launch Problems, Security Absent","Hello,Funcom really dropped the ball here. They didn't even secure their registration servers. Who is going to register using a credit card when someone could steal the information?The game has had a terrible launch. I looked forward to it starting, but from the information posted online so far, this has bombed. Wait a few months if you want to avoid the frustration. EQ is frustrating at times, but it isn't anything compared to AO. You have been warned!"
1,This game is garbage and I cancelled after a month,AO rivals WWIIOL for the worst release of a multiplayer game. Show stopping bugs that they were never able to fix even after 2 months after release and a development team that has no idea what it means to have paying customers.
1,Just plain bad,"Bugs, Bugs, Bugs. Support isn't bad, it's non-existant. I wouldn't mind playing through the bugs, every online game has had it's stumbles out of the gate, but there is just nothing fun to do in Anarchy Online. Get a copy of Asheron's Call. Still a great game with great quests and great people."
1,VERY Painful Experience,"Just to reiterate everyone else's experience: spontaneous crashes, lots of lag, big time bugs, poor graphics, and quite frankly - boring gameplay.To top it all off - after the last crash I've had to REINSTALL Windows since it would not boot.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
1,"Dont waste your $, or your time.","Even if this game was free, I doubt I would continue to play it.The company that created & maintains AO, 'Funcom', honestly has the most horrible customer relation skills out of any gaming company I've ever worked with. The game looks gorgeous. And it's designed so that the first dozen levels or so get you hooked. But then it's horrible. The company doesnt care about it's players, never fixes the bugs in the game (which were of minor concern to the players) without causing 20 more horrible bugs that are just innacceptable. Save yourself while you can, invest your precious time into something else."
1,worst game launch ever,"The game is the worst game I have ever seen launch. It has been out for several days and the bugs are numerous. It takes up to an hour to log on even with a extremly fast internet connection. The game crashes constantly, Lag is horrible, game play is terrible. After attempting to play the game for several days i have found that the probems are not being fixed but are getting worse."
1,never again,"I would have given it a zero, but there is a one star minimum here.Never again will I buy another Funcom product, or for that matter quite possibly any Norwegian software. These peopel have no clue how to program.The game itself is grosely imbalanced with unimplemented and/or very poorly implemented features such as the imbalance between the Clans and Omni Tek, the 2 primary factions.The developers lack of foresight, product testing and aoverall ... decisions have made it even worse causing the vast majority of players to leave.Currently there are between 3500 to 5000 players out of original 35000 people that played this game still logging in. These are mostly new players that havent had the chance to experience any of the games problems yet..."
1,"Like a Christmas Ornament. Pretty, fragile, and hollow.","This is not worth 12.95 US per month. You will be paying to beta test the patches Funcom writes, as the currently seem not to. Check the boards. Look for the fallout on patch 12.6.The graphics and sound are beyond anything else out there. Support, storyline and content are non existant. Gameplay is repetitive and dull. You can hunt until about 80th level (1 week or so to get to), then you will be doing missions. Until 200th. It's just hunt, level. Do missions for loot, sell, buy new implants/nano/equipment...rinse and repeat.Exploits are legion, most tradeskills do not work...there is no PvP balance.This game is not ready to be called a ""retail release""."
2,Please pass this one by!,"This game is a basic shell of a game, which means right now, it works but very basically. There is no content. Pass this one by."
1,REVIEW,"I signed on from day one of retail and it has been downhill ever since. This game is even buggier than when it was first released, if you can believe that! They have absolutely no customer service. Emails and in game help requests go unanswered. Aside from the pretty graphics and if you can get it running long enough before crashing, you soon discover the game inside is very shallow. The mission generator makes the same boring missions except you have different wall textures. Game balance doesn't exist and they're still constantly nerfing character classes. Everybody is cancelling their account in droves. Ironically, this may improve lag for those of you foolish enough to stay.Not my words, but absolutly true. BIG BUMP!!!"
4,This Is Our Youth-a brief comment.,"A powerful exploration of lost youth during the Reagan Era. Lonergan has a gift for creating real dialogue and characters. Dennis, Warren and Jessica are all like people I have met. As someone who came of age during the same era, I can attest to the authencity of this work.I also recommend ""The Waverly Gallery"" and the film, ""You Can Count On Me"", recently released in the US for further evidence of Lonergan's talents."
3,"Important, well written, but flawed","This book offers an important contrasting perspective to accounts of the Crusades from the European point of view. One cannot help but be appalled at the many atrocities that were perpetrated on the peoples (Christian, Jew, and Muslim) of the Middle East by the European adventurers.I think there are two flaws, however:1. Malouf does seem to have an axe to grind and this seeps into his narrative at times. The work would be even more powerful if he did not seem to set out to prove the perfidy of the invaders.2. To the casual reader without a strong background knowledge in the events related, the one-sidednesss of the narrative leaves too many unanswered questions. Why did the Europeans invade when they did, and where they did? What were the economic, political, and social forces that drove them? He doesn't offer any insight into the behavior of the Europeans, which, if he did, would make it a more valuable work for the introductory reader."
5,SOLID,"Virtually unknown in the U.S., Mike Scott latest opus is absolutely wonderful. With each listen, the rich textures of each song unfolds. This is his best work in years!"
4,Typical Good Mike Scott: some gems and some duds,"The skin shiveringly beautiful ""Love Anyway"" is worth the price of the CD. Also good is ""Sunrising"" (the ""Still Burning"" title track). ""Everlasting Arms"" is beautiful too, I just wish it wasn't about God :-) As I write this, I'm listening to Scott's ""The Whole of the Moon"", on the ""This is the Sea"" album --- perhaps the finest song ever written in the english language. I may be exaggerating there, but not by much. There's nothing _that_ good on ""Still Burning"", but ""Love Anyway"" gets about three fourths of the way there."
4,"Lovely, relaxing eye pillow","I thoroughly enjoy this eye pillow. I've had it for several months now, and it still retains the lavender smell. I wasn't exactly sure how long the smell would last - so far so good! I also like that one side of it is really soft. I lay that side on my face and it feels really nice. My only complain is that the stitching on the eye pillow is not as tight as it could be. I put some pressure on the eye pillow, and some of the lavender has come out. Other than that it is great!"
3,I expected much more from Carlton Smith,"It's hard to conjure sympathy or empathy for the principals of this case because the author gives you very little background on them. The scant details that are given about Dr. Rowan's wife (Debbie, the victim) essentially reduce her to a non-person; not to mention the facts are erroneous. Much of the information is obviously culled from newspaper articles; and for some reason, Smith spends more time on the city's new newspaper editor's role than the hapless Debbie Rowan. The omission of important testimony leaves the reader to wonder what the motive was. Basically, this was an interesting story, it just wasn't very satisfying."
2,Not what we expected,"We have a problem with blue jays raiding our feeders and have successfully deterred them with the original Absolute feeder. We wanted smaller feeders that would do the same thing and thought these would work based on their claiming to keep larger birds out. However, the spring adjustments didn't allow for light settings. In fact, we're not even sure that they would close for a red squirrel. They do have a satisfaction guarantee so we sent them back and ordered the larger original."
1,Quality is NOT good,I must say that 15 years ago I had one of these feeders and finally got rid of it 3 years ago. Well just so you all know that the quality in constuction materials is inferior! the metal is sO thin that after 2 weeks of squirrels jumping on it the holes where the metal holder goes in has streched and I can no longer hang it because the holes are so large. There is a plastic piece and the squirrels have destroyed that to! I have no problem paying good money for something but this was a BIG waste.. Don't bother!
2,not too happy!,"The birds stopped coming because of the landing bar moving under different weights. That sounded like a good feature that would keep larger birds away, but when several birds landed at the same time, it would give way beneath their weight and they would fly off. The bar is adjustable, but didn't solve the problem. It does keep the squirrels from getting to the seed."
5,"birds pleased, not so for squirrels","Sturdy item that does not feed the squirrels! It does actually hold the large amount of 10 lbs. The sender did send it on time,too!"
2,Heritage Farm squirrel proof bird feeder,I have used these feeders for the past several years and wanted to add two more. I first went to the Heritage Farms web site and they were priced at $50 so went to Amazon web site and these looked like the same bird feeders for only $37.59. I guess you get what you pay for as these are made in CHINA with cheap metal and the metal hanging bar is not a single piece of steel. It has two hinge joints on the side arms that will wear out I am sure! The real Heritage Farms feeders are made in the USA. I think they should be advertised as made in China.
3,squirrel proof bird feeder,"Has good resistance to squirrels accessing feed, but they can jump on it and make in swing, causing feed to fall, plus they can reach through the small openings on the side for the tension bar adjustment and get a small amount of feed"
4,Collision of evil empires,"I listened to the Audible Audio abridged version of this book which I will rate as only a four star. The narration was adequate but not outstanding. Years ago I read the book and liked the full version better. Beevor does not sugarcoat the almost inhuman conduct of the campaign by both sides. The results were disastrous for the Germans but not much less so, humanly speaking, for the Soviets. There is not a lot of tactical detail here but a skillful weaving of high level strategy and front-line anectdote."
4,Detailed and well written Stalingard,"I had heard a lot about this book before I finally bought the pocket version. And I must say, as a student of East European affairs, this book added a lot to what I had read about this amzing and terrifying battle between the Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Before reading I knew that Stalin was ruthless, Beria was a a monster etc etc. But all the little detalis presented in this wonderful and indeed very exciting book (I almost was unable to put it aside, but my children forced me...) gave me a much deeper insigth into this horrible campaign. Now I really understand the suffering of both soldiers and civilians during this dark period of Europan history!Not 100% perfect, but almost!!"
5,"world class, great sense of narrative","I found this book excellent, there are several strong points :* strong sense of narrative that gives the reader a sense of why events were occurring, how they interrelate with one another, and where the key mistakes were made* good insights into the decision making on both sides, how personalities, both of the military staff and the dictators, had an impact on events and outcomes* fair in its treatment of both armies, who were both incredibly brutal to each other as well as the civilian population. This book does not subscribe to any heroic narrative or myth* book gives you a real idea of the suffering and misery that occurred during the battle, both for the combatants and the civilians"
2,Very one-sided,"The author does a wonderful job describing what went on within German command during the battle, but same level of detail is lacking for the Soviet command. Virtually 80% of the book is written from the German point of view. This is not surprising since the bibliography contains barely 3% of Russian sources. This makes for a very boring take on this crucial battle."
3,Not the Best Available,"If you want to read the absolute best history of the battle for Stalingrad read Roger Craig'sEnemy at the gates, by far a much much better read."
4,"Compelling story, pedestrian writing, poor editing.","Anthony Beevor's compelling narrative of the Battle of Stalingrad is the chronicle of a self-inflicted debacle of unsurpassed horror. Evidently meticulously researched, is suffers from a pedestrian writing style and often inexplicable editorial lapses (e.g., ""Willis"" throughout for ""Willys"", manufacturer of the celebrated Jeep vehicle, and flags flying at ""half-mast"" rather than at ""half-staff""). These and similar irritations aside, the story is intrinsically so horrific and extraordinary that one cannot put it down, long after the awfulness has become almost intolerable. Its chronicle of blind stupidity, extraordinary heroism and appalling brutality surely encompasses the best and the worst of the human experience. Recommended, but not on a par with, for example, Bruce Catton's historical narrative."
5,A must read military history,"I have read other books about this battle, but this one so vividly describes the scope, breadth, fury, intensity, and cruelty on both sides of the conflict, that it reads as a fresh account. The ""give no quarter, take no prisoners"" mindset of everyone involved helps us grasp the importance of the outcome to both Germany and Russia."
4,"Best book on Stalingrad since ""Enemy at the Gates""","Very similar to ""Enemy at the Gates"" -- the book has many personal accounts from the campaign. While ""Enemy of the Gates"" seemed to lean towards a Russian perspective, ""Stalingrad"" gives a much better German perspective. And unlike ""Enemy at the Gates,"" Stalingrad examines military strategy and German and Russian atrocities. Most interesting is the author's accustations German Wermacht participation the slaughter of Jews. Even Manstein is implicated."
5,A very powerful narrative,"Because the book focuses on presenting the story as it unfolded and let the bare facts speak for themselves, it maintained a very powerful narrative. The author thankfully did not fall into the trap of trying to describe in different words how horrible Stalingrad really was. Such lack of emotional suggestion succeeding in communicating the atrocities of the siege even more convincingly. In addition, the author did not default into a dry academic style either, but maintained a highly readable prose. Therefore, this book is a rare combination of a thoroughly researched, well told and believable account of an incredible moment in history."
2,More of the same.,"This book will disappoint if you're looking for something new on the subject matter.Futhermore, the author's prose is dull and noticeably disconnected,in my opinion.This book is probably suitable as part of a ' Barbarossa Starter Kit' or for those who have a general interest in human tragedy stories."
5,Shower curtain,"Very cute shower curtain, and quality material. I put it in my beach house bathroom and it looks great! I would recommend it."
5,jeanie,I love it!! It was just what I was looking for. I have gotten many compliments on it. Super fast shipping and reasonably priced
1,Xenon NOT White Bulb,They shuld change thati bought this a week agoThey not white at all !!!!bright?YES is 100 wattwhite?NO
4,Spellbinding,I literally could not put this book down. Very good reading. Unexpected twists. Will definitely be looking for more from this author.
2,A Slow Slog,"It takes the first third of the book to get to any kind of a story....The heroine just ambles through her stay at home job, her past life, dining in, dining out, jogging here, swimming there. To put it mildly, her life is boring. The murder mystery is kind of boring also. Lots of people, lots of facts, a slight almost romance, some tragedies, some work, more dining in, dining out. Some facts fit, some facts don't. The murder is solved eventually somewhat, somewhat not. There is a dog that is and who's life is, much more interesting than our low key protagonist, but alas, the dog vanishes from the tale long before the end. This is a sleeper, literally. It was a freebie so no harm no foul."
4,Sexual Assault Survivors Beware!,"Excellent book, well written and captivating. A few words of caution: GRAPHIC RAPE SCENE!!! I liked the story enough to have someone else read over that part to find the end and then continued, but I couldn't even read it all the way through. VERY rough. The rest of the story is wonderful, but be forewarned."
2,This goes for all the books in the Trilogy....,"I personally didn't like this book...maybe because it was so discusting without needing to be (the rapes and sex discribed in GREAT detail) or maybe it's not my type...I found it overwhelmingly shocking but I guess that's just me. I suggest that no teens read it unless they like the things metioned above or can read it without flinching. I definitely couldn't. And it isn't a matter of my maturity here (fourteen years old). I know I could never get to love this book no matter how much more mature I get...respect it for its great storyline? Maybe? Love it as a favorite? Never.I give it two stars because I think that without all the flaws, it would have been a four star."
5,Love it.,"I picked up the third book at the O'Hare Airport in Chicago, and read it first, since I was headed out of the country and looking for something to read on the plane. Loved the third book so much that I had family send me the first two, and I have since shared those with other family members, so this is the second copy of these books that I have ordered."
5,dark and beautiful,"Being a fast reader I read this book in about four hours and was very hard to put it away. The pages breathe life into a shadowy era that we don't know much about, and presents characters that seem to live beneath your fingertips. Although it is fantasy, Mariller writes so that it truly makes you believe it happened at one time. For a first novel, Mariller exceeds some of the more seasoned writers by far. There are unforgettable scenes, such as young Sorcha caring for Simon in the herb-scented hut of Father Brian. It is enchanting and yet incredibly real."
3,Excellent if troubling writing - and Kindle trouble,"This is the first book I've read by Marillier, and I have to say that I enjoy her writing style and the cadence of Daughter of the Forest. Ms. Marillier treats this fractured fairy tale right, although given some of the disturbing content I'd be hard pressed to call this book appropriate for young children.At one point I did find that Sorcha/Jenny's plight seemed melodramatic, although that may be because the first person style lends itself to such a thing.The one thing that truly annoyed me is the fact that (at least in the e-book/Kindle version) the last chapter has a big problem with typos! Unlike the rest of the book, which is well edited, the last chapter is riddled with errors like ""te"" instead of ""be"" and ""tte"" instead of ""the"". I'm not sure what happened."
3,Based on an old Brother's Grimm story,"Ironic that the review praise this author for original thinking and writing when her first book is based on The Six Swans, by The Brothers Grimm, right down to the nettle shirts. A decent read, nonetheless."
5,Tear,This is the best book I've ever read. At the end i actually cried in joy. I could not put it down until the very end and i've reread this book more times than i can count. i've recommended it to all my friends and now they own it just like me. Anyone who likes fantasy read this book and wear bring tissues for when you start to tear up.
4,Great read!,This was a well developed story line filled with a cast of characters that keeps you involved through the end of the book. Looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.
5,Fantastic start to a series,"I picked up this book because I love most any book about Celtic folklore/mythology, and after having read just a few pages, I couldn't put the book down. This book went with me everywhere until I had devoured every word! This is one series where I won't be able to wait for the next book to come out in paperback before buying it.Its a wonderful retelling of one of my favorite legends of the ""Swans."" Great femine heroine, love, sorrow, this book has it all."
2,No reason to read this,"Overwhelming mediocre, there is literally no reason to read this book. It is not ""bad"" per se, but there is not a single redeeming quality in the story's plot, dialogue or characters.Sorcha is stunningly angelic and one dimensional,and she never wavers in her task. More than half of this book is romance, rather than fantasy, and is misleadingly classified. Mariller fumbles through cliches as her eventual lovers cannot communicate their feelings, and Sorcha's brothers all fit obvious archetypes.There is nothing new here, and nothing done exceptionally well, and as such, you would be better off reading something else."
1,I didn't enjoy this book,It was a simplistic romance novel and I don't think I've read of a more passive main character.
5,Doesn't get any better than this,"If I could, I'd give this recording 10 stars. Anne Sofie von Otter and Jerry Hadley combine glorious singing with seething passion. The intensity of ""Pourquoi me reveiller"" would move a heart of stone. Dawn Upshaw's sweetly sung Charlotte is an added bonus. Nagano brings out every nuance in the score. Breathtaking and powerful. I love this recording. I don't see how the new set with Gheorghiu and Alagna could possibly compare."
2,Really Disappointing.,"When i picked up this book, i expected a heart-warming story about a boy that learns the value of life and realizes that he had a family all along. Well, That's not the case. In the beginning, A boy named Harley Nunn gets abandoned in the middle of the Arizona desert and witnesses a dog being left behind too. You'd think that the rest of the story would be about Harley finding a home and having a great life. But this idea is abandoned about 2 chapters into the book. He encounters an old woman that offers to take him back to where he came from. But, she takes him and the dog to her old house where a strange man is living. She kicks the man out and makes Harley clean her house for the rest of the book."
4,An insightful view of a child's anger & how best to respond,This book completely changed the way I viewed my child's anger. Now I can be more understanding of the real underlying issues involved and respond in a more constructive and confident manner. His anger is a plea for help and I am now his helper. Reading this book certainly improved our relationship.
3,discrimination,"this book is for ages 8 and under, my question is why, adults seem to actually enjoy this book more then kids, as it reminds them of the powerful power and control they have over them. for example when the bunny felt powerful because he grew the biggest strawberries, the power was taken away, by his mom who forced him to go sleep"
3,Not one of Mike's best CD's,"I personally don't quite understand why everyone is so eagerly ""accepting"" this CD as one of Oldfield's best albums. The first song is quite good but Family Man is quite a dull, disco-like, song with no creativity what-so-ever. The Creation which follows it has a tune very similar to Parsons's ""I Robot"" taken togather with Vangelis...The forth creation is the reason for my relativelly high opinion of the CD. This tune is a good reason enough why this CD IS an Oldfield-CD and a good reason to buy it (if on sale).Five Miles Out (the fifth song) is quite good but I heard better ones on CD's like Earth Moving.All in all, not bad but not good..."
2,Jose Cura - Puccini Arias / Domingo,Jose Cura - Puccini Arias / Domingo is a 1997 erato disques starring José Cura as he sings the arias by Puccini. None other then Placido Domingo leads the Philharmonia Orchestra. One would think this would be a great decision for a conductor but it ends up being just passable. Cura is no Domingo when it comes to the sing department and at times it feels forced. Not terrible by any means but if I would have to get a grade I would be forced to say subpar. The booklet contains besides all the lyrics also great music notes. Not recommended. 2/5.
4,Almost really good,"Cura's voice is not the typical lyric tenor. He has the first really ""muscular"" tenor voice I've heard. At times he uses it to great effect on this compilation.It's clear that Cura's voice is suited to Puccini's more intense style. Compare this recording to his collection of Verdi aria's and you'll get the point immediately.I agree with other reviewers that the highlights of the CD are the pieces from Manon Lescaut. I also enjoyed the excerpts from Tosca.Surprisingly, the ""Nussun dorma"" is weak. Given the power of Cura's voice and the character of the song, you'd think this would have been a real showpiece."
1,Coarse and childish.... and an incomplete story at 424 pages,"Reading S.M. Stirling's review on the cover, ""One of the best fantasies I've read in 15 years, bar none"", I couldn't wait to read this book. I was so disappointed. It read like it was written for live-at-home (in the basement) young adults. There was no flow to the story, it was choppy and badly strung together. There was no development of any relationship between Ash and her officers. The author tries to hook the reader with a gratuitous sexual violence scene in the first five pages that I found boorish, foul, and unnecessary, especially as it concerned an eight-year old girl. The e-mail's inserted were stupid and extremely distracting to the story, not adding but detracting. And the ending was nonexistent.... this is nothing but a serial in a magazine, an unsatisfying read to say the least. Very imaginative idea, but badly written."
2,very average,I was Hoping that Michael Jackson's version of it was a Good year would be featured but it wasn't.nevertheless this disc is very hit&miss.the arrangements sound really tacky in spots.the problem with much of the material is that it trys to hard to Emulate Franks Style&Sound.you just can't do that.but it has a few moments.such as Night&day by the Temptations.
1,WHAT??????????????,I definitly didn't understand this at all. I found this book SO BORING. There was so much going one I couln't unerstand it. I would read the second and third one but I found book one so boring I am not going to read them.Don't waist your money on this book!!!
4,Everest the Climb,"Have you ever climbed a mountain that was bigger than any other in the world.Well Cicero is planning on climbing Everest, along with three other kids. They are hoping to reach the top, but there journey is not easy. The weather is cold and dangerous, but the competition is more dangerous. An unexpected thing happens, the contest becomes a life-or-death rescue mission.no one is believed to survive in this scary cold weather.In the book, the part that I liked was when Cicero would always says shutp toTilt and would always roll his eyes at him. the part that i dont like in the book is that some one might die in that cold and dangerous weather.Iwould reccamend this book to a person that likes journey and adventure stories."
1,Lenox Butler's Pantry Earthenware products,"B0001GUZ08Very disappointed in the Lenox Butler Pantry earthenware advertising.The Salt and Pepper Shakers show made in the U.S. , but mine are marked made in China!I have ordered the Dish Set ..the advertising states Italian earthenware mine shows .. made in China,China is sending goods with tons of lead..now how do I serve food with this product unless I test it?"
3,FUN FOR A GIRL OR A BOY,"I liked the NARUE anime, so I figured I'd check out the manga, and I must say that overall, it's a pretty close match.Much of the dialogue, even the camera angles, have been similar between the manga and anime in the first three volumes. And, although this particular volume has its serious moments, the humor, when it finally does poke it's head out like a turtle, explodes off the page!And don't get thrown by the subtle use of flashbacks and flashforwards, either ... just hold on for the ride, especially since the jokes usually pay off rather well. Best of all, the humor generally springs directly from the plot or characters, and isn't just shoe-horned in for a cheap laff.What can I say? If you liked the anime, you'll probably groove on the manga."
3,Pretty Close,"I thought the staff to be a little thinner, not sure if I read the measurements wrong but I still got it and use it for exercise quite regularly. Is better for strength and conditioning not so much for general use."
1,Typos Everywhere! Book should not be on the market. Zero stars.,"This book containe 3-4 typos in each story! I have contacted the editors and publisher to the extent possible online, and have received either no response or the equivalent of ""Eh, whatever . . . ."" This edition is supposedly for English speakers who want to improve their Spanish -- but apparently no one involved actually knows Spanish, or can be troubled to proofread. The book should not be on the market at all."
5,Great for keeping '98 EB going past 250K,good book for a layman like me to keep cost down in the economy. Made all types of repairs (easier ones) and saved $$$.
3,What did you expect?,"As I sit here reading the reviews for 'The Serpent' I am confused. Most reviews thus far either hate or love this album. I am sitting on the fence. I can't say I hate it because I think this album has bright spots on it, on the other hand I can see how some wouldn't like it because the dark spots on the album are extremely bad. Honestly what did you expect though? Still Remains has never been a band known to be groundbreaking music. This album is straight up metalcore, just like their last album. This one dares to step outside the metalcore realm however but it seems to be a step in the wrong direction. I personally can't love this album but at the same time I can't say I hate it and won't listen to it. If you want a groundbreaking album buy something different, if you want straight up metalcore...this is for you."
2,Mostly Disposable,"It seems that Still Remains wanted to make themselves heard, and they thought ""'Of Love and Lunacy' was a mediocre metalcore album that brought nothing new. Let's improve our sound!1!"". The problem is that ""The Serpent"" is a complete change in sound, and the band has basically become a clean polished and annoying pop-rock outfit. ""Of Love and Lunacy"" was a catchy album, even though it brought nothing new to the table, but ""The Serpent"" incorporates annoying clean singing and wish-wash ballads like *cough* Maria *cough*. The band has basically become a former shadow of themselves. However, there are some moments in songs like ""Avalanche"" and ""Dropped From The Cherry Tree"" that redeem the true Still Remains. That's not enough to recover this trainwreck of an album. Best off downloaded."
2,Not what I expected it to be!!!,"I am actually quite disappointed with this book that I just received. It is not much of an activity book. They should have called it a 3D crinkle book instead because that is pretty much all it does. Every page is the same crinkly fabric over and over again. I was hoping it would have buttons to fasten, zippers to zip, velcro to put together, ties to tie together, etc. but it doesn't. If I were to design a book I would put all that kind of activities in it and more. It does have a string with a handle that you can pull and an object moves, but I feel that is only something an older child will be able to master. I am still hoping that it will keep my child's attention and prove me wrong, but I doubt it. For people out there who are thinking about buying this book, please don't waste your money because it is not worth the price. I am sure that you can find another activity book on the market with a lot more ""activity."""
1,What the Heck?,"September 16th a reviewer in here from Ohio says the following: ""Maybe it's a long shot, but at least RavenWolf gives it a try."" HUH?????????? RavenWolf? Wasn't that Raymond Bucklands name when he had his coven (well supposedly had his coven). Well the old papers I have says it was. Amazing! These reviews are getting way too weird.Maybe people who write books should be required to use their REAL names!"
1,Not very good...,"While it probably sold a lot during the angel craze, this book offers little to magical practitioners"
2,She should change her name to Silver CashRegister,"I am a practicing Witch. I believe in Angels. Some of this book works, some doesn't. Silver RavenWolf preys on youngsters without a clue, in the hopes of selling a few more copies. I used to like her. I'll admit it. ""Magick Cauldron,"" great. ""Sacred Flame,"" great. ""Teen Witch"" and ""Silver Broomstick"" are waaaaaaayyyyy too saccaharine for anyone who wants to practice the Craft seriously. Go buy books by Scott Cunningham. He had a clue, he was passionate, and wasn't trying to bilk the young. RavenWolf's books are too damn perky and exist solely to make young people think they're hot s**t in front of their friends. That ain't Wicca. Ka-ching, ka-ching!"
2,almost as good as entry level,"This sounds similar to some of the Altoids amps that hobbyist began making in the 1990s. It is made up of cheap opamps in a fancy wooden cigar box but it's still better than the headphone jack of most components. The hobbyists that made those Altoids amps (literally in little tin Altoids mints boxes) continued to revise, improve, use newer opamp chips, and better components... so this headphone amp is not nearly as good as those are. Avoid.[spelling corrected - Thanks, internet! -ed]"
1,Worst Value Per Dollar Imaginable!!!,"Ok, this is a little better than the sound card in my macbook pro. My apogee one audio interface is almost as good. But neither one is made for powering headphones like AKG K702 or DT990 Pro which are my 2 favorites. I bought this knowing Grado is a good, well respected brand. Sadly, I had to return it. It seems whatever you spend on a headphone, you have to spend at least double on amps to get good sound out of them. Honestly if you are spending 350 on this, move up to the NuForce HDP for 450. It is the absolute best value for the buck. I got one of those because my budget was under $500 for headphone amps, and the good thing is the NuForce HDP gives you preamp, amp, and DAC all in one. If you are buying any headphone over $100, be prepared to spend at least $500 to get the best sound out of them."
5,love the cd,this is a great cd and it had no scratches even though it was used. it came on time. great
4,Seattle then and Now,Interesting history and pictures of a city often visited. It has a reputation for being green and it does live up to it. Have been to many places in the book but will make sure to investigate others.
4,the link in the wwII atomic bomb.,"This book primarily talks about the personal the background, and why they were been sent to Japan. There is a suppliment in the back about what happen to the uranium."
2,Wrong title - It should be Little known Panther projects,"The book shows all the designed AFV variants on Panther chassis. If you are looking for Panther tanks, very little information will be found inside. For each Ausf. D, A, and G less than half page is used, but there are many pages dedicated to Bergepanther or AA guns built/designed. The night Panther with IR is well covered, including a side profile and the cutaway drawing. If you collect Panther books, this is a good addition for your collection, but if you are looking for the well known tank, look elsewhere like Squadron's Panther in action."
5,UPSETTING,I find this book most upsetting and fell every American should read it for an understanding of what is happening in the United States today.What is most upsetting is that I believe there is no turning back to our path we have taken.
2,Not What I expected,This game is not what I expected. It said you could raise Sea Monkeys but that is not the case. You do raise Sea Monkeys but the only thing you do is protect them. Not cool. Not what it said on the review. Don't waste your $.
1,not worth even my kids' time,"I got this game for my kids, can't even believe I bought it used for $3. it's so stupid, and even my kids don't like it!!you have to capture yellow colored fish (don't touch the green ones, they'll kill you) by the time the sea monkeys swim to a shell-base.there are difficulty levels, but even turning the level up, doesn't help the game.this game might be a good way to TEACH a child how to play a video game for the first time"
2,Which one is ist?,"This appears to be mislabled. I'm looking for the album that is pictured with Charlie Rouse(his last with this group before his death)It appears the album being sold is the 1998 debut of the Gary Bartz edition of this group which was just called ""Sphere"". I'd like to get ""Four For All"". A little clarity please!"
4,1 bad light,"now I would send it back because one of the lights went bad, But the other light is so strong I dont need 2 so im sticking with one! :D good product I have always Trusted Logisys. 4 Stars!- SC mods"
5,Really cool,Easy to put in and connect. Comes with Velcro so that everything stays were it is suppose to and sticks well.It lights up the inside perfectly so that everything really glows! Very neat.
1,Junk - Buyer Beware,"I hate giving bad reviews but the true meaning of ""You get what you pay for"" holds true in this case.I had purchased 2 sets of these and each of them had a bad light but I ended up with 1 good kit from both.The cost it would have been to replace wasn't worth my time so I had pitched the bad lights and moved on. I'll just make a mental note and look for something different if I need lighting in the future."
1,Couldn't even finish it,"this is the worst documentary i've ever seen. the first review was obviously done by the filmmaker or his mother. the editing is horrible and the graphics look like they were done on a commodore 64. this must be a student film because most of the interviews are college students or college professors.this movie is incredibly boring and the graphics really get in the way. god, this thing was bad."
1,Drew just can't sing!,My experience with Drew's group of CD's is that THE SONGS ARE NOT ORIGINAL RECORDINGS ! They are performed by Drew's bands or other wanna-be's. Don't be fooled!
4,The Beginning,Lewis' book is a history and theory of the law of sexual harassment in education. The area has grown since the publication of this seminal work....Since the Lewis book was published Title VII (and state human right acts) remains the cause of action for employees and Title IX has become the cause of action for students.The book deserves an update.
3,Disappointing interviews,"I am fascinated by Albert Hoffman, the (inadvertent) inventor of LSD and found him quite wise and charming, even at 100!. I can't say the same for most of the others who were featured."
2,"Seller has no phone number, not readily available","I had to cancel this order on a Sunday morning, 1/2 day after making it late Saturday night. Seller has no phone contact and despite emailing them directly and through Amazon, emails were ignored and they shipped the item anyway on Sunday afternoon -although I don't know how Fedex was open then. Site claims it takes 1-2 days to ship items. Now I am stuck with shipping x2 due to an absence of good communication. Still no response. Right hand has no idea what left hand is doing, apparently. Lesson: always buy from a real shop with a real phone number. Also, seller has a ""store"" website where same items are offered at lower prices and lower shipping but with no working checkout. Disappointed in vendor and ability to contact."
4,Danceable and No Problems,"I continue my short exploration of Middle European music - see Novák - by hoping you'll buy these 2 first symphonies by the Slovak composer Alexander Moyzes. Let's hope Marco Polo finds time to record more of the other 10 because this compelling, danceable, problem free music is perhaps what you're looking for in wintertime.All right, not even these symphonies are altogether without problems (how to stop for instance), and sometimes the grainy recording-quality is raw and not very detailed but the music wins on points and the musicians on enthusiasm.It's good to hear Slovak players playing Slovak music because this orchestra can let you down on music which is not in their souls (they've done lesser things for Marco Polo and Naxos); so here they're on home-ground."
2,Maybe for beginners; not a quick reference,"As a psychologist, I was looking for an updated reference for psychotropic medications. I got a book about underlying neurobiology and diagnosis with a few low-detail tables on medications. This seems to be a textbook at a student level. The ""look inside"" that I got did not give a good assessment of what I'd be getting."
5,"If you are a student of psychology, this book MUST be in your personal library!","A great reference work that does an awesome although be it cursory job of covering psychopharmacology. An added bonus to the text is that it does a fine job of touching on numerous ""high points"" concerning abnormal psychology.GET IT!"
5,Amazingly Insightful!,"I have been working in E. Africa doing aid work in one village in particular now for about 4 years, including 5 visits. It has always been a great experience, but sometimes the things that happen are baffling, and we seem to run into far more cultural barriers than language barriers.When I read this book before my last trip, I was stunned! Finally, so many things began to make sense! I tried many of the suggestions put forward, and they were right on the money. Things went much more smoothly, and we felt like we really had begun to understand the meaning behind so many of the actions that have always left us confused and feeling like we might have just made a big mistake...but we aren't sure what it was!I recommend this to anyone who is going to be dealing closely with Africans and wants to increase their cultural intelligence. It's not just about money, it's about culture, and our view of the world vs their view of the world. Unbelievably helpful!"
1,Bad experience,"The book was suppose to be in good condition but it had writing throughout it, a couple missing pages, and high lighting all over."
1,Absolutely disappointing,"I am really disappointed, and don't understand the reason of such good reviews. I bought the book, skipped a lot of marketing pages, found no preface (really, I cannot find it), and what I discovered later on was just a bunch of concepts without any structure, that could fit better a pub-talk than an universtiy textbook. Frankly speaking, I could find much more scientific accuracy in my secondary school and university preparation textbooks, and most likely, much more precise concepts. Incredible."
4,required text book,This is a required text for a university lab biology class. So far it has been satisfactory and the professor obviously considers it a good source.
4,Great Quality,"This book is in great shape and is great to purchase because it is so much cheaper than the most recent edition. Ask if it is ok with your professor to have the older edition. If so, this is the one you want."
3,buy 6th,"Unless your professor requires that you use this edition (which they shouldn't), buy the 6th edition, which is cheaper. The only difference between the two is slight text changes and rearrangements of the chapters. It's not worth your money unless you are drawn to this edition (trust me, you're not). Oh, and the study guides aren't worth it if you actually go to class and read the text."
5,Definitely a line worth waiting on!,"I first became familiar with The Line Up Book when a parent brought the book to school, when it was her child's library day. The book was fabulous,it didn't contain too many words and the story is really cute. The children all enjoyed the book and were excited to see the line getting longer and longer with each new addition. The illustrations were simple, a good size, and colorful.I was thrilled to find the book on Amazon and ordered it immediately. I will be using the book as an introduction to help my three year old Preschool class visualize the concept of lining up. The illustrations open their eyes to the possibilities of objects in their environment they too can line up."
4,Scorpion Palace,"This is a great set. It took a decent amount of time to put together and it was fun. It looks great too and the alternate models on the back of the box look like they'd be great to build too! Wish it came with instructions for those. The minifigs are cool, though I wish it came with more Palace Guards. Are you listening Lego? The action features are neat as well, very Indiana Jones, which is the idea. I've had a lot of fun crushing Lord Sinister underneath the boulder. I even read the instructions on how to play the game and it seems like it could be really fun. This was a good idea. Now I can attatch all my Orient Expedtion sets and have a whole world of adventuresome fun."
5,Great Deal,"I bought this for frequent calls to Uganda, where we work with a school for orphans. Obviously, we want to spend as little as possible - but communication is vital. when I switched to Voice stick, our school's administrator commented on how clear the connection was. The best thing is... a 10 minute call to a mobile phone there is only about a dollar!also, I use a Mac and have had no problems with the downloaded softphone - I don't use the ""stick"" itself because with the softphone I don't have to."
5,Voicestick is Great!,This thing is great for people who travel a lot..or make lots of long distance calls. If your children travel away to college....you can buy 2 of them for under $50....and just pay $3.99 a month each...and you get unlimited calls to each other.The call forwarding feature also allows you to make free calls when routed through your Voicestick.
3,Becoming Madam Mao,"If you like politics and government theories, this may be your book. Writing not the best. Moves unevenly between narrator and main character. Timelines difficult to follow."
5,Fascinating,"This historical novel puts a human face on the events in China from the Long March through the trials of the Gang of Four in a way that no other book I've read has been able to do. It is vividly written, and months after I finished it, I still recall passages almost word for word. It is a wonderful book."
2,Very Disappointing,"I read Min's Empress Orchid earlier this year and I adored that novel, so I decided to give Becoming Madame Mao a shot. I wish I hadn't. It took me forever to read this novel because it was so boring. Not only was it dull, but Min used a multi-voiced narration that was confusing and unnecessary. I would have enjoyed the story much more if it had just been from Madame Mao's point of view. The constant changing, every other paragraph, to a different voice was jarring and really made me dislike this work. It had potential to be such an excellent novel but it completely fell flat."
4,Madame Mao flip-flop style,"Actually the reviewer Candace wrote an excellent review.However I think people need warned again (this is already mentioned in the primary review) that the nature of telling this story flip-flops between being told as ""first person"" & then ""third person"" which gets you a bit dizzy keeping up. Perhaps it was meant to contrast the duplicity of this woman of many names but it can be annoying.Read it as a bit of fanciful history, or just as a good novel... either way it certianly was entertianing."
1,So bad it's funny,"This book is hilarious, it's so bad. When one of the character swears, it actually has *@#&$(*#&!!! stuff instead of the real word (like a cartoon.) The dialogue is stiff, cornball, and unlike any real speech I've ever heard, and the plot is melodramatic, with the hero and heroine at each other's throats in a very contrived way. The heroine talks to herself all the time (as opposed to real dialogue) and at one point exclaims that she's fallen in love with a yankee! (note--this isn't a civil war story).This may sound harsh, but while I would never recommend this book to casual readers, it's not a bad resource for writers who want to see what can go wrong... (Really, it's that bad. I read it two years ago, and it's by far the worst book I have ever read.)"
5,Getting to know Lewis,"This book is a collection of essays regarding C.S. Lewis by those who were acquainted with him at various times in his life. I've returned to reread it, or parts of it, from time to time. The book fills in some gaps for those of us who won't know him personally until we join him on the other side."
3,Hip Cat,"Captures the ryhthm and spirit of jazzTale of pursuing what you love, transcending your own limits and succeeding in the face of popular dissinterest.Blues and Haikus with pictures and cats and dogs in it."
2,cats ripped holes in the mesh,this was a nice carrier. we had it for about 3 weeks. we have a scratchy cat who kept on scratching on the mesh while in the carrier during a long ride. he ripped a pretty big hole in it so we threw it out
5,Cat carrier,"I love this cat carrier. It makes it so much easier to take my kitten places. My sister got one for her 13lb cat, and I got one for my 6lb kitty and they work great for both. Much more convenient than the hard cases to carry around."
3,Flimsy,"I bought this carrier for my cat, and she liked it but I couldn't help noticing how poorly constructed this bag is. Be aware that the mesh is very flimsy, it's really soft and I imagine a cat could easily claw it's way out. While my cat is fairly comfortable in carriers, I still didn't feel she was completely secure in it."
5,perfect pet carrier,"Airlines are tightening their size allowances, and this one just fit USAirways limit. My dog didn't whine or complain on a long flight from Mpls toSan Juan, and it was easy to carry on. Easy to put a pet in also."
3,Bad display,"The display had to be replaced on the laptop. It was clearly a hardware problem, but of course I had to spend the couple of hours on the phone with Sony going through setting the resolution, reloading the driver, restoring the operating system.The technician replacing the display was very helpful.The laptop has crashed (froze) on a about three occasions."
1,Don't buy this tape!,They should pay me for the time and damage this tape caused to my painting project. Scotch should be sued for calling this painters tape. What a disgrace.
1,Don't bother,"This is not a novel or play. It is several pages of garbled notations, none of which makes sense in any language."
1,Retractable Lead in Color Blue,It works for two weeks then it stops working. CHEAP. Trust me buy a good one not this one.
1,False advertising,"This is a 500mm f8 lens with a teleconverter: that equals 1000mm @ f16!!""Phoenix 1000mm f/8 Telephoto Lens with Mount for Canon EOS 30D 20D 5D Digital Rebel XT XTI & Film SLR Cameras"""
3,Take notes.,"Wanted a mass market edition and got a trade book instead.That's okay, but with a trade book I expected illustrations, especially photographs, to be larger so a person could get a fuller image. The glossary is seriously lame. Easily half the aircraft, naval and armament terms in the text which the average reader is unfamiliar with do not appear in the glossary. This required a manual word-search through the text to remind oneself of a technical meaning when one touched upon the subject again later in the book.On the upside, one acquired a good idea of the construction, workings, personnel, methods, complexity, scale and international political clout of an aircraft carrier including a story line of an exercise at sea with its operational effects far inland.In short, a hard to use book, but a good read."
5,Love these stories-back to my past,I purchased this book as a gift to my husband. It was a little reminder of the past and I hoped one day to read them to my children. The book is in great shape and I'm very happy with the purchase. It arrived quickly and as described. Very happy!
5,Great commuting music!,"It's philistine of me, I know, to title this note the way I did. But I find that I keep this set in the car and often as not this is what I reach for when I commute. This 'anthologie' is taken from that huge and prohibitively expensive set of all the Scarlatti sonatas recorded by the late lamented Scott Ross. This set will do unless you're a real Scarlatti nut. The performances are uniformly limpid, phrased in a loving, unforced, musicianly way. Ross uses several equally beautiful-sounding harpsichords."
2,disappointed,i was very excited when i heard that someone had recorded all of the scarlatti sonatas. being a harpsichordist myself and a scarlatti nut i am always interested in how others interpret his music. I have to say though that i was deeply disappointed in ross's lack of depth. I have about 15 other recordings of scarlatti on the harpsichord and this is by far my least favorite.
2,Falls flat,"Sorry, the animated version of Mr. Bean just doesn't work.I'll give this series two things in its favor. One is that if you're comparing it to many TV cartoons, it's not too bad - it's competently done, unlike most cartoons on TV today, which are disasters. The other is that, being a cartoon, it avoids the sometimes-risque humor of the real Mr. Bean shows.But beyond that there's nothing much here. Even my kids just sat and watched without laughing - and after a couple of episodes voted to skip the rest. We're all big Mr. Bean fans, and this just did not fly."
3,A superficial but at times engrossing film.,"A rather superficial treatment of storm chasing, complete with cheesy ""dramatic"" music and attractive young female storm chasers. Discussion of technical matters like Doppler radar or the conditions necessary for tornado formation is either incidental or entirely absent. Nevertheless, the film does at times capture the awe and exitement of chasing. There are dozens of tornadoes and some interesting mesocyclones and wall clouds. Some of the edits are annoying, cutting away from a tornado just as a subvortex is about to descend, for instance, or showing a newsroom staff looking at a monitor when we actually want to see what's on the monitor ourselves. The film is worth watching, though, if only for the final 10 minute sequence showing chaser video of the violent and deadly May '99 Oklahoma City storm. All in all, this is lightweight filmmaking speckled with some truly fantastic footage. Recommended, grudgingly. I'll give it three and a half stars."
2,This CD compilation doesn't quite make it!,"I have enjoyed so many of the Rat Pack compilations I couldn't wait for this release. So far though I am disappointed. Granted the re-mix is great and the orchestra sounds crisp and probably better than ever heard before. However the song selection seems bottom of the barrel. Ok let me be nice, the songs seem more a rarities collection. Perhaps the B side of singles, or the last songs added to an album as after thoughts. The cd didn't kick the way Frank, Dean and Sammy would have done it. In fact if this was a live performance, I would think the trio was out in out bored. At times on Dean's solos I even questioned if that voice was really Dean singing. It simply sounded too diluted in the re-mix. I gave the cd two stars because it is still worth a listen, but if today was back in the Rat Pack hey day, this album (cd) would be destined for the $1.99 discount rack."
3,attention au droits de douane et TVA,"Acheté aux US, avec 70$ de frais d'expédition, préparation... (je pensais ue tout était compris)or j'ai reu 15 jrs après la livraison 1 facture d'UPS de 70 correspondant aux droits de douanes, TVA, et bien sur à leurs frais de dossiers (car ils font l'avance), au final cela ne vaut pas forcément le coup."
5,FAMILY HISTORY,I also am looking for a copy of this book. It contains my family history as well. If anyone knows where i can get a copy please email me at dzrogers@hotmail.com thank you
5,An outstanding text,"In my opinion this work is simply the best introductory surveying textbook available, and I've seen more than a few."
4,Pretty good for California Civil PE Surveying test,"I bought this book for the Civil PE Surveying test. I would recommend its use for this test. I found several answers directly from this book, answers that weren't in the typical test prep book that most people buy.I'd recommend buying this book and also one old, outdated text book (pre 1980's at least). The exam seems to have some questions that are more of historical note than they are relavent to modern surveying - I had a couple of answers that weren't in this version of the book but were in the 6th edition, because the topic covered has become outdated."
5,Inspiration,"What an inspiration this book was for me. To travel all over and make people enjoy the game you love after over-coming many obstacles and handicaps...this book can inspire those who love golf, dogs, traveling, the pursuit of a dream! Truly, something I will remember"
1,"Horrible book, really awful","This is another of those pity party books. Really, just another poorly written book that has no redeeming qualities."
5,Awesome Doll Car Seat!,"My 4 year old daughter received this doll car seat for her birthday last week. Immediately after opening the package, the car seat was installed in the back of our van for her baby dolls. It is so realistic - 5 point harness, has the same bright yellow ""warning"" label on the inside of the seat as do the actual infant car seats, also included an offical LATCH harness. She uses a Cabbage Patch kid and the straps are a little long, even after adjusting them, but the baby doll doesn't seem to mind one bit. Word of advice: Give yourself an extra 2-3 minutes for your little one to get her baby doll all buckled up and safe for the upcoming car trip!"
3,Very superficial,"I thought this book was very shallow, though somewhat entertaining. Budiansky summarizes the gist of a lot of research on dogs, but you might as well go to the source--it will be a much more interesting read. Instead of this derivative and superficial book, read Raymond and Lorna Coppinger."
2,actual users guide,"tell you the ins and outs of guys plumbing. Its like health class all over again, with just a tiny bit more infomation."
5,Very tight for 33x12.5xR15 Goodyear MT/Rs,"The QG3229CAM chains were a good fit with the 33x12.5xR15 Goodyear MT/Rs on my Jeep Wrangler.However, these QG20074 Quik Grip Light Truck Traction Chain Rubber Tightener are a very tight fit. The technique, suggested in another review, for starting at 8 and 4 o'clock helped as did warming up the rubber so it was above freezing. That allowed me to get a reasonable approximation of a pentagon."
3,poker table top,it is ok. works good. but not nearly as big as i was expecting. seats 8 but there's no way you could actually fit 8 people around it. great for about 5 people. looks nice.
3,"Impressive at First Glance, Basic Quality Lacking in Details","I received this table and I am returning it and re-ordering it.Let me explain:When I first opened it and stepped back I noticed:1. Felt quality is good.2. Graphics are impressive.3. Overall appearance is nice.4. Blackjack/Craps insert is a nice bonus.However after looking a second time I noticed:1. One of the long sides had the felt worn off all along the top near the edge (about 1/2"").2. There were two wrinkles in the felt where the material was not smooth.3. One of the fold hinges was exposed because the felt was not properly secured.The table is definitely a good VALUE table. It's safe to say that the low cost is due to poor quality control wherever it's manufactured.I'm ordering another because, for the price, it's worth a second chance."
3,Poker Table Top - adequate,"We like the convenience and the way the cut outs keep the chips in order. One issue is that the topper doesn't lay flat easily and needs to be ""broken in."""
4,"Tragic, but....","Anyone who has had cancer closely touch their lives will relate to and sympathize with the author. However, at the end of the book I felt I knew much more about Carolyn Bessette Kennedy than I knew about Anthony Radziwell. I would disagree with the reviews that fault the author with at times wanting to run away from the situation which is a common and credible feeling for any primary caregiver of a person with this awful disease. It struck me, though, and maybe this is because universal health care is out front in this election year, that it was so much easier for this family to deal with the illness, given their private rooms, the best of specialists and their numerous trips and retreats between treatments."
4,So much unexpected talent from a Real Housewife of NYC,"I read this book quickly...it was so moving and ""from the heart"". One cannot help but wonder what makes a woman with her talents, connections, and name degrade herself so by being a ""NYC Housewife""on a tawdry reality show. I almost passed over the book for that reason and I would have missed out on a lovely and moving story."
5,Kindred Soul,"Not recognizing the Kennedy connection at first, I found this book applicable to everyone who loses a loved one too soon. The story catches glimpses of another world but connects on a level we all know. Having just lost a loved one, the book allowed me to acknowledge fears and thoughts previously not spoken out loud."
5,A stunning read,"A heartfelt memoir, beautifully written. Carole is a fascinating woman with an incredible story and her strength is something to be admired. One would think a princess would not be relatable to your own life, but she definitely is. Tragic, but also inspiring."
3,Where's the beef?,"She is a very relatable person and catches your attention early on with the commonalities shared in the 70's and 80's, however more than a quarter in, I'm still waiting for a plot or storyline. At this point, she's been describing what everything looked like during her entire childhood, which is pretty boring. Don't know if I'll make it through."
5,Read it 3x!!! That's rare for me to revisit a book that way....,"I originally bought this book for two reasons. One is I'm a big Housewives fan, enter this hilarious author. Second, I've got a huge JFK fascination & have read many books on the family. What keeps me coming back to read it again? Ms Radziwill has a fabulous gift for honest yet sarcastic storytelling. Take away her Housewives and Kennedy connections and you've got one amazingly talented and interesting woman!"
5,Everyone should read this book,"This book is a delicate and amazing account of a tragic tale. It's written so perfectly that I read it as much as I could for three days, ending on the final night in tears at 3am. I laid in bed and cried and cried over the whole story and wanted to give the author a hug. This is a beautiful book."
1,Not worth it,"She has an interesting story to tell but tells it leaving out many details. If you want the details..read ""The Other Man"" by Michael Bergin. That book is well written and tells the ugly truth."
2,Shock -- but I wouldn't call it pleasant!,"I saw Carole on Larry King and Oprah. Let's me first say --CAROLE IS NOT A KENNEDY!!!!!! The media wants to make her one and she refrers to herself as one. The media wanted to make Micheal Shakel one and he wanted to make himself one. These people are not Rose Kennedy's grandchildren thererfore they are NOT KENNEDYS!!!! She missed the chance at writing a really good book and cashing in big at the bank and there is nothing wrong with money, and advancing her career. SHE SOLD OUT!!! She sold her husband, John and Carloyn out and down the river.It would have been refreshing if she had written a book from the point of grief and coping and had excerpts from experts in this field. She could have used her personal story as background, but not as the focal point of the book. She could have told her story of her and her lost of her husband and John and Carolyn without going that PERSONAL into all of their lives."
5,Heart warming,I loved it. You have to read it to understand the author.. Carole is a real woman. She tells it like it is. I loved her love story.I could not put it down.
4,I enjoyed this quiet book.,There's no Kennedy hype in the quiet and sweet story of love lost. It is sad because it is about love lost -- not about love found. But this little memoir and tribute to lost lovers and friends a rewarding read.
2,Make sure this is what you want....,"I used to have a copy of the Soundtrack from the Fright Night movie (from the 80s I believe) and I really liked some of the songs. I saw this listing and it's a bit misleading since it pairs up the Fright Night Movie DVD with this CD (and has Brad Fiedel's name on it...whose name is on my Fright Night Soundtrack). This is in fact NOT the soundtrack. It is a compilation of some tracks from various horror movies (like Halloween). Not bad...but all very slow and monotonous. And the 2nd CD is in fact a DVD. It is a copy of the ""Night of the Walking Dead"" movie. My guess is the old one...(I have not watched it)."
4,good choice,I bought this book becasue my son has a gtube. And he has a big oral aversion and very sensitve to tastes and textures. Book provided a good understanding and how to cope and deal with this sitaution. A lot of good information and tips!!
4,Nice hook at a nice price,"This is a great hook for the bathroom. It's large enough to hold a big robe, towels, just about anything you can load on it. It looks great in an older traditional bathroom. The great thing about it is that it's exactly the same hook that you can buy at restoration hardware, but a lot less expensive."
3,Not sure why I get to rewview this product since I did not buy one,"However Tom Tom does not work with Apple Macs.Too bad, another Bill Gates only company.This is why I did not buy their product."
2,Notorious Base Problem,"After having installed the unit for 43 days, the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting. This was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit ""Flying""! Very dangerous!!Tomtom would not replace the unit, as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks! buyer beware. See the TomTom forum for description and picture:[...]and other links to the base issue."
2,"ok gps, bad accessories and update","the window attachment on the t/t won't hold the unit up...it starts to sag after a few bumps... i have to let the t/t ride on the dashboard and use the attaching mechanism to keep it from sliding off...very poor design... i tried to do the update...it was so confusing that i must have selected the wrong update...anyway...the update caused the t/t to drop dead...hmmmm...what kind of update is that...anyway...for $450, i just want to plug the thing in and ""go""... i don't want to hassle trying to figure out updates which should be a slam dunk...i don't want to figure out how to jimmy the window attachment...i would not recommend the t/t based on my experience...not at $450..."
3,GPS great. Clock diden't work.,"I used the TomTom 910 in Southern France. The GPS functioned terrificly, even beeping when the speed limit changed. Unfortunately, the display clock didn't work, almost immediately. After spending an hour on the phone with a very nice and knowledeable tech, I mailed the device back to TomTom and am waiting for it's return. Were it not for the clock, I would have rated the 910 a ""5""."
1,Poor Design,"The Tom Tom 910 is very large and cumbersome. It can only be charged in it's cradle. All of the inputs, microphone etc are located on the windshield bracket. Although it is bluetooth compatible using it with a phone requires the use of an external microphone. There are only a limited number of phones that it interfaces with. The rechargeable battery only lasts 2 hours. Overall very poor"
1,Buy Tom Tom at your own risk,"I bought a 910 2 years ago. It has pretty much since then been sat side by side with my Sirius Sat. radio on the dash of my truck. My Tom Tom Died last week from what I can only summise as being overheated, I summise this as I have had problems in the past with the unit not switching on when hot.I called Tom Tom tech support to be told the unit was out of warranty and they do not offer a repair service.I was offered a Loyal customer discount, which basically meant I'd have to spend alot of money with them to get a replacement.Funny how this device has sat on my dash for only 2 years and dies whereas my Sat. radio has been there for over 5 years and is still going strong.All in all I am throughly disapointed in Tom Tom's service and the quaility of thier equipment.B e warned."
1,Any brand but this one,"This and all of the TomTom products seem full of bugs. With the 3 people I know that have different models we have ALL had problems.Anything from breaking within days of buying it to just bad directions. You can be in a parking lot and this thing will make you leave the lot, take a left, drive in a complete U, and then take a right. Does it ALL the time rather then just telling me to take a right out of the parking lot.TomTom is just junk as they are made in China and they act like it. Try one of the other brands do not get stuck like i did."
3,Tom Tom no good in Eastern Europe,"I bought this thing only to find out it has no coverage in eastern europe. I live in Macedonia and travel around this region I thought the Tom Tom would be the thing to have, NOT!. I tried to download what maps they had and that didn't work. I called them and was told they couldn't verify my credit cards (and I tried three of them all drawn on US banks)because their server won't accept transactions from eastern europe. I'll be selling this thing to the first sucker that comes along and will never buy from this company again. When you are in an area that has maps it works pretty thats why I gave it 3 stars, but customer support is awful."
1,Bad news for me.,"They state,ready to go out of the box,thats not true.There's a quick step folder,shows how to to set it up.Then you have to run a disk to put some added features in by clicking the box next to it.At the top of the page there box ,thats reading connect device. I connected, and reconnected but it would not go pass this point.Decided to return it.......Ahhh but wait,theres a button on top that turns the unit on.after neatly repacking every thing,I repeatedly pressed the button to shut it off, As I slowly closed the box,the tom tom was still shineing a way,"
3,Expensive traffic updates,"We bought the Tom Tom primarily because it has the US as well as the European maps included and are pretty happy with the overall performance. Some of the menues are a bit complicated and I had wished for a bit more customizing abibity for their structure, but the list of POIs is much better than in other navigation systems I tried (Nüvi, BMW).But here is the catch: In a metropolitan area, one big advantage of any navigation systems are traffic updates. With the Tom Tom, you have to have a mobile data connection (costs me $20 a month) and they recently started billing us for the Tom Tom plus service as well ($30 a month). So the overall cost of this feature are just prohibitive, especially when compared to other products like the Nüvi where the traffic updates are free over FM."
2,tomtom 910 dies,"The product was great for one day, then it froze up and could not be revived, even with a soft restart. Tried to contact the merchant who sold me the product, but after talking to their reps on three occassions, they still did not get back to me with a resolution for my problem. After having spoken directly to tomtom, was I able to sent it back to someone who would fix or replace my two day old unit. It was TomTom. Thanks TomTom."
5,Highly Suggest This GPS,I got a chance to borrow a friend of mine's GO 910 and I highly recommend it for people looking to get a gps for their car. I didn't need any instructions and it was the easiest thing to use(and I'm no tech genious!!!).I think it was updated with the latest maps and it took me exactly where I needed to go-- no problems.I have no complaints about this product and am now looking to purchase one myself!!!
5,We love it!,"We have been very pleased with this product. We love the protability of it. We keep it charged and by the front door and grab it when we go out, so we can both use it in our cars. It has proven itself very helpful on the many local and long distance trips we have taken. We have not found anything that we have asked of it that it cannot do."
3,T0mTom GO 910,"Disappointed in connecting with website for updates. Connection to TomTom home for downloading updates and information difficult to use. Connector on usb cable to home charger loose fitting, falls out. Home dock unit is replaced if request made to support. Need to purchase cd-rom to update maps.First update after purchase should not be charged $10. Unit does function very well. Is impressive. Other items above need to be corrected though."
3,"Tom Tom GO 910 started out bad, satisfied with it now","Got the Tom Tom on the recommendation from a friend (a techie!). I was originally thinking of a Garmin. The Europe map feature on the GO 910 was attractive. I was very disappointed with the 910 in the first few days. I set up the GPS to give me directions to my car dealer (I know very well how to get there from my home) just to test it. I blindly followed its instructions (even though it was a bit different from what I would have done normally) and it got me completely lost (it was within a few blocks), but if I was really new to the place and completely relied onthe GPS (which is what I expect from these products) I would have been completely LOST. Since then my experience has been better and I guess only time will tell.........."
2,Software is a mess,"While the hardware itself seems to be OK, (hard to tell though, I've spent so much time try to install the maps)the process of getting the maps to the TomTom seems to be a throwback to 1995. Since the included SD card is to small to handle the maps I wanted, I got a larger card. For some reason the maps on the updated CD couldn'tbe processed. You had to go online to get an activation code for each state. After getting that code I then gotan ""invalid activation code"" message. Screwing around with this mess isn't worth it.Additionally, after getting the newer 910 (mine was stolen) I found nothing was compatible. Not the purchasedmaps or connectors. You guessed it, not even the external antenna.All in all it has been a very unpleasant experience."
3,Nothing special - Good intro but very light on examples,"This book disappointed me as it failed to meet my expectations. If compare this book to the author's EJB book then you will be disappointed like me as well. This book explained the basics of Web services and its J2EE examples. Although the content and examples are well paced at the end all I found is this book lacks a real world architecture and implementation strategies. Like me, many reviewers told the same as this book does'nt cover much more than the J2EE 1.4 tutorial in aspects of Web services. I felt like I lost my grasp of Java examples at the end as the book did'nt finish how to put all the APIs together."
3,Excellent book for a developer/practitioner,"This book is very useful for developers/architects who are writing system software or application software dealing with web services.If you are just going to write some web service client code to access some web service or planning to deploy simple web services, then this book will not be very useful.There is good coverage of XML Schema, UDDI, JAXR and WS-I Basic Profile wherever relevant. The J2EE 1.4 model web services are explained in decent detail. Some extra examples would have been better. Of course the number of pages would have increased then.To be an architect/developer/practitioner of web services related technologies, you need to have a sound knowledge of the theory behind the specifications. You can always look up online tutorials etc for sample code. This book will provide you the theory behind web services.Anil SaldhanaChicago Java Users Group"
2,Not so great,"The general quality of this product is O.K. and I've no complaints over the material construction, excepting that they don't fit my feet as well as normal flip-flops. The soles are flat and stiff, without give. I feel that even a minimum amount of bend works better with my stride. I'm willing to concede that they may feel better after being broken in, when the flat begins to sink and mold to my heels and toes, but as low traffic house slip-on's, that could be a while. This stiffness is what Zori's essentially are; as a matter of preference, I'll stick to normal flops."
5,Love.,"We've had this for almost 3 years and it still looks great. I use Snow River Wood Oil on it and after it's oiled, you would never know it's that old. I do not cut meat on it...I use a plastic board that can go in the dishwasher. Just makes me feel better, but I think others could cut meat on it and be happy w/ proformance. Nothing stains it that I've found."
4,"A little different, but it grows on you","I am a huge fan of PB. NFB and Ends of the Earth are two of the best albums I've heard in the last 10 years.(Five stars). I only recently purchased Ghost in a Spitfire because I couldn't find a decent price on it previously. I was skeptical at first because the approach is similar to Ends, but the arrangements give it a totally different experience. I am really digging this album after several listens. Its a little darker at times but its also more rocking at times. You can tell he was experimenting more and I always love that in an artist who doesn't want to repeat. Give it a try if you're into PB I am really glad I finally picked it up. He is artist who deserves a huge audience, but like alot of the great ones I am sure some people just don't get it. Great album, but not quite a masterpiece."
4,Snakes of South Georgia and South Carolina,"I would call this book a pamphlet. It is only 28 pages and for this pamphlet,[[ASIN:0966740203 Snakes of Georgia & South Carolina], I feel it is a bit overpriced. The color pictures of the snakes are very good and because of the color pictures, I do like this ""a bit over priced pamphlet""."
5,Acting Book Gem,"Finding a good acting book is tricky. I got this book from my local library, it was one of the only few acting books they had. The title and front cover made me skeptical, I thought it would be some acting failure/egotist with his stupid made up technique, but this book thoroughly surprised me. Best book on acting I've ever read, I don't know why I'd never heard of it before. It's simple, sound, practical and it works. He offers a way of approaching material that is very freeing for the actor. I like it also because it doesn't intend to be a crutch to an actor which a book on acting shouldn't be. It offers a passage way to your own discovery, because that's the work of the actor, the exploration and discovery which can't be taught. This book is a great comfort and makes you want to act more. It's short and sweet and really helpful. Read it."
5,Brings out the homemaker in all of us!,"This is a wonderful book! It is full of anecdotes, helpful hints and receipes, all wrapped up in her wonderful folksy humor. She is an old-fashioned country farm person who can tell you how to do everything from scratch. It is the kind of book to curl up with when feeling warm and cozy and have a need to cook something the old fashioned way for the family! I gave a copy to my daughter who also loves it! We both got new recipes and tons of information on how to cook many things not in popular cook books. Her commentaries on country life feed a certain requirement we all have for the ""old days""."
3,A Little Weak,"I have been looking for a good organic genmaicha in a tea bag style. This is not bad, but the flavor is weak, or maybe the portion per bag is too small, and I have to use two bags to get the flavor I get from my favorite (non-organic) genmaicha. And even then, the flavor is just okay. So, I will use what I have but continue to search for that perfect organic genmaicha."
4,Citizen Kane's progenetor?!,"Has anyone noted that Orson Well's Kane is Peter Lorre's Dr. Gogol incarnate? Perhaps it is due to the fact that Gregg Toland was the cinematographer for both...and perhaps other technicians as well, such as make up artists, went in tandem with Toland reworking the set and design magic of Mad Love for Wells. The likeness is unmistakable, particularly in Kane's destruction of his second wife's bedroom after she leaves him. Wells' genius was for finding and using the great talent that preceded him and the German cinematographer- director Karl Freund was cinematographer on F.W. Murnau's 'The Last Laugh' the personification of German expressionism that has as much to do with self-destruction and pride before the fall as Citizen Kane did 25 years later"
1,disappointed,"This album sounds like it was written and performed on a Casio keyboard one afternoon for a dare. I not sure what kind of Party he had in mind when writing it, but it will definately be useful if you need your guests to leave."
2,Poor,"Either you have never been to a real Luau, or you dislike your friends. This was a poor selection on my part."
4,Worked Great,Very pleased with this purchased. Recharged my car A/C in a few minutes. I admit that I used to work on auto A/C years ago (R-12) so I was able to determine that the problem was low freon. I would recommend researching to try to determine if the system is low & try to eliminate other possibilities. Over-filling a system can be very dangerous so if you are not sure keep a close eye on the pressure gauge.
2,"Waterproof, but . . .","doesn't have much else to recommend it, unless you're going to be in Italy, know no Italian at all, and have no access to any other source on ""Where is the bathroom?""--level Italian. The information contained in this oversized folder is extremely limited. Inexplicably and inexcusably, the pronunciation guides tell you nothing about where the accents are to be placed in words. Also, the folder is too large to fit into a purse of reasonable size, though it will with only mild discomfort fit into the interior pockets of at least some suit coats. It's too big to use inconspicuously. Much more useful would be a decent pocket-sized phrasebook."
5,Is He Straight ?,"Having read many books on the topic of straight spouses, I highly recommend this book. It would be especially helpful for someone in the early stages of dealing with this issue. The first book I read four years ago that helped me this much is Grevor's My Husband Is Gay. Kaye's book does not claim to be scientific, but is packed with EXPERIENCES compiled from her own doomed marriage and thousands who have traveled the same road. Also read Kaye's Doomed Grooms. I did not think Kaye needed to go into as much detail as she did about her own former sexual experiences, and she overstated and oversimplified some things, AND she needs to hire an editor to take out the typos. But in spite of those drawbacks, the book is EXTREMELY helpful for any straight spouse who is in the confusing questioning stage. I'd buy two--one to keep referring to, and one to give to a friend."
1,Poorly Done,"This book is not a fair assessment of the complexities which exist in marriages where one partner is gay and the other straight. Bonnie Kaye treats this issue very simplistically by stating the only way to happiness, once it is found out that a husband is gay or bisexual, is to divorce.Her experience cannot be applied to everyone. I'm sure there are many women who want to wallow in self-pity along with Ms. Kaye. However, if women want to have a deeper understanding of what is happening to them after their husbands come out to them, this is not the book for them.Divorce is not the only solution, although it may be right for some people. There are many examples, which Ms. Kaye fails to mention, of successful, happy couples who are in mixed-orientation marriages."
5,Couldn't put it down!!!!,Wow! Spine tingling! Riveting! I couldn't put this one down! So visual! I love a good thriller and this was it! Where is the movie!!!!!!!I can't wait for her next book! A definite must read!
1,you cannot place candidates after reading this book,"It appears that the suggestions on how to ""address objections"" are those similar to writers before Chris and I was looking for new approaches. The tips on how to handle ""counteroffers"" are the same ones that I've seen in HR magazines. I was looking for more of a ""steps to follow"" process to increase my placement ratio."
5,Enobling,"It has been years since grade school and high school, where I ""studied"" history. I don't remember being so motivated to study then as I am now... after listening to this recording.I have just acquired more David McCullough works, because I find his work very warm, personable, respectful and interesting. This recording is a great boost to those who, like myself, need a little push to get more reading time in. What? Listening makes me want to read? Yes!"
2,Beware- this is not a book,"I was very disappointed to have paid $8+ (June 2011) for the Kindle ""book"" with this title. This is NOT a book, rather the text of a nice lecture by David McCullough that is a very short read. This is not at all very clear in the description of the ""book"" on the Amazon website. I see the paperback version is now less than $4.- perhaps Amazon has now tried to adjust the price to the actual content. However, I think that buyers ought to clearly understand what they are buying. One will note that no book summary with the actual number of papers is provided."
5,In his own words.,There is nothing better than hearing an accomplished author speak about his craft in his own words. He is a terrific author of history and his sincerety and love of his craft is abundantly apparent in this CD...
2,Lacking in quality,"I wish I could recommend this product, given that it is environmentally friendly, but I cannot. I recently tried them out and they perform poorly. The sheets seem to be slightly smaller than standard paper towels, and they fall apart quickly when wet. In fact, even when they're dry, pieces rip off way too easily when just trying to grab a sheet off the roll. They don't soak up much of any liquid before they're completely useless. So, to do the job of one major brand name paper towel, I need to use two or three of these!My recommendation: buy a better quality paper towel, and use them sparingly. (If there's a better recycled brand out there, I'd love to know!) Also, keep a stash of reusable cloth rags handy and use them whenever practical. I feel better about that than I do about buying this and practically tripling my paper towel use because they aren't up to the task!"
1,what green does not mean,"I am very unhappy with Seventh Generation Paper products. I like that paper products decompose, but I would prefer that the paper starts to decompose after I use it. I have had problems with all of their paper products, especially the napkins. After I used Seventh Generation Napkins at a picnic, my hands and mouth were covered with small pieces of paper. Normally a picnic napkin will last the whole meal. A Seventh Generation napkin will not even survive one wipe. Maybe they accidently switched the toilet paper formula with the napkins. I have decided to stop using all Seventh Generation products to send the message that hiding under the umbrella ""green"" is not license to produce garbage."
5,Love these,"This is the second time I ordered these paper towels! I am very pleased with the quality. I love that I don't have to worry about running out of paper towels for a long time! I have five dogs and I m always cleaning up messes, and I think these work great!"
4,good absorbancy,"Seventh Generation Paper Towels are super absorbant, while providing a great way to use recycled paper. Everything you need in a towel - when you can't use rags for Mother Earth!"
1,I thought these these were terrible...,"...my wife wants to go ""green"" as much as possible so I gave these a try...forget about soaking up spills, these things are practically waterproof!...forget about scrubbing, they fall apart like wet tissue paper!...I want to be environmentally considerate but I practicality carries a lot of weight and these towels fail in that respect."
3,Absorbs about 1/2 as much as bounty,"These towels are good enough for what I want them for, to spray and wipe down the cat box area. But for spills and to actually absorb they are worthless. I did a test with a bounty towel and the bounty towel was ready for more but this towel was just pushing water around. So its good for some uses and bad for others. So for spray and wipe its perfect, a 5 star. For picking up a spill its a 1 star."
