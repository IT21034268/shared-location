3,Quality is only moderate,"The carpet/floor brush is a disappointment. It's relatively lightweight, and just doesn't match the quality of the vacuum cleaner itself, which rates 5 stars. And paying more than a hundred dollars for PLASTIC fittings is galling. But you need them to make the vacuum cleaner functional."
1,crap,Don't even bother. I'm a professional musician who has used all kinds of picks - this one is worse than not good - it gets in your way.
3,"Cool, but could be better","I love the feel of these, but the attached pick is low quality and wears down quickly. I wish you could attach your own pick and then these would be awesome."
5,It's no 2-3 minute fix,"If your looking for a 2 to 3 minute song like most of the music world today, you won't find it here. Hell, you won't find it in any Mars Volta song. They have easily became one of my favorite bands of all time, and trust me, I know music. This is the closest thing you will get to seeing them live. And to the people who say that they are boring or whatever, I would like to see your bands like Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, or whatever other crap they play on MTV, entertain the crowd for TWO AND A HALF HOURS, like the Volta did on their last solo tour. Maybe if the Volta were playing in the 70's, they would be as legendary as Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, or Jimi."
1,*Sigh*,"The music is dragged on for days, aimlessly, Cedric's vocals are quite annoying and he is obviously trying to excede his boundries. It seems they are taking themselves way to seriously. I am A huge TMV fan, don't get me wrong, it's just very hard to listen to hours of uselessness. I don't feel like being taken off to parallel dimensions with a song. Remember kids it is just music. So anyway it's pretty appearant that TMV is gaining a bigger fan base with each album, and don't forget that's the main reason ATDI said the broke, because they were garnering too much mainstream attention. So buy up all TMV stuff while you still can tomorrow they might be ""The Aurora Borealis"" or something else they read in an encylcopedia. Viva ATDI."
1,Transpondamant Marsupial Dice Nodules (This Sucks),"If you like pretentious music that goes on for hours and serves no purpose, look no further - Mars Volta are the masters. Here on Scab Dates they take their horrid act on the road where they wow (bore) audiences with endless noodling and incomprehensible dictionary lyrics. I can say that this CD definitely captures their live act, in the same way that the Zapruder film catpures Kennedy's assassination: they both give you a front row seat to something awful that you wish never happened. I once attended one of these musical disasters and after the show, I saw so many people tearing up ticket stubs, I thought I was at an OTB outlet. As someone who was a big At The Drive-In fan, I am still baffled by the loyal following of rabid fans that Mars Volta has developed. Well, at least somebody likes it."
4,Blew my mind,"This is a ridiculous album. There is a great deal of ""white noise"" so to speak between songs which I will say are perfect if your in the mood to space out and really analyze what you are hearing. If you are not some of these walls of sound can become a bit tiresome, but when it is what you are trying to hear it does NOT get any better than this. The final part of Cicatriz isn't exactly from a live show but rather was made up of all kinds of bits and pieces of live material until it finally kicks back into the original lines of the song. This isn't a must have cd but if you are a die hard volta fan or just want to hear how they sound in the live format you should def cop this disc.ps...Cedric is in top form and Omar is tighening his claim as the best guitarist on the planet with this album!"
2,Not Impressed,"I have been a fan of The Mars Volta since I first heard them back in 2003. In my opinion, 'De-Loused in the Comatorium' is one of the best albums of our time. The problem I have with this album and 'Frances the Mute' is the lengths of their ambient breakdowns in songs. I think 'De-Loused in the Comatorium' gave the perfect combination of music, experimental elements and entertainment. I just don't see it as much on this album. I know that it is expecting a lot for a live album to have these things all over again, but my expectations are always high for The Mars Volta."
5,not for casual fans,"this is not the place to start if you are new to the mars volta, i own every mars volta release including the Live EP (not including tremulant ep) and i love this cd, omar occasionally tests my resolve to love this cd, but the songs recorded at concerts are incredible, my favorite song is concertina which is absolutely incredible, take the veil cerpin taxt is another great, TMV really shines on cicatriz where they spend about half an hour improving, if you love TMV as much as i do this is a must"
3,Picking wounds,"Though this edited live disc can represent the modern progressive powerhouse at full-forced acceleration, the entire proceedings can feel lumbering and merely reminiscent of the tracks studio power."
3,A bit of a let down.,I love Mexican tiles but I felt the book was a bit of a let down. The pictures were a bit small and there wasn't enough information about tilemaking in the book. I think the book would have been much more effective in a larger format where the tiles would have been more impressive. There are some wonderful talavera tile websites on the net for anyone who wants a better overview.
3,Great content,"Book has great ideas. Wish it had been hardback. Book binding, does not want to hold together, considering the wear and tear it shall receive. This is also a great book."
2,extra light,"the most powerful aspect of this book is its title (it persuaded me to buy). the author spreads about a tablespoon of jam over twelive slices of bread. creative acronyms for basic concepts. doesn't acknowledge the sophistication of the ""influencee"" so to speak. too basic."
1,dull,"I returned it.If you are an artist looking for inspiration, you won't find it here.The only fresh thing about this book is the title.Photos are bland. It is more academic without the kick or good design in""Live Through This.""The content would only be of historical interest.I ordered this book because Amazon stated"" Customers who bought ""Live through This"" also bought this book.I imagine they are getting a lot of returns."
3,Not like picture,The picture shows the side rails much lower than they acctually are. I was quite dissapointed to find that I cannot leave the ramp down because my door will not pass over the top of the side rails.
5,This ramp solved a number of problems for me,"The old ramp was wearing out. Also, my mother was feeling insecure walking on the old ramp with her walker because of the pitch and the width. The width and length of this ramp are ideal for our situation. The extra width along with the side rails make her feel safer, and the extra length makes it less steep. The ramp is very sturdy, and it won't require the upkeep that the wooden ramp required. I did have a bit of a concern regarding people tripping over the rails, so placed 4x4's on either side and painted them yellow. I put small solar-powered lights on the 4x4's so that people would see them in the dark. That might sound like over-kill, but it looks good and it works."
2,dougv,"I enjoy films about military airplanes, especially ""recips"" (propeller driven). The Spitfire is a wonderful fighter.The movie was a disappointment. It was slow moving, with a poor story line. Very little dogfighting was shown.The editing was poor. The scenes in bars and where they sat around were too long--made the plot drag.This is a film not worth buying."
4,A starting point for an independent animator.,This is a good book for students of animation really. It is easy to read and does step-by-step through animation processes and how digital technology is integrated into that workflow in a fairly accessible way that also entertaining.
1,30 Year Old Out of Date Usage,"Book may be useful for the professional Portuguese ""translator"" that is looking for a variety of colloquial word usages ranging from 1983 to many years back. But for everyday ""informal"" Brazilian Portuguese spoken today, I have found it of little use - - buyer must remember that while Amazon says the book is a 1984 copyright date (the book itself says 1983) this book is two decades (or more) old. Informal everyday word usage in Brazil today is much different than from the 70's and early 80's. I travel to Brazil once a month and have found it of little use."
3,Not bad,"This book has some interesting convergence proofs and is a good reference for people doing research in the area. However, the non-standard notation makes it very difficult to follow, and the abysmal explanations do not help much. Do not get me wrong, there is some elegant math in this book, I just wish they'd made it a little easier to read.If you're a practicing engineer, you should probably look at Widrow's ""Adaptive Signal Processing"", Haykin's ""Adaptive Filter Theory"", or Farhang-Boroujeny's ""Adaptive Filters"" (an EXCELLENT, though not very well known book) instead. If you're a researcher, the book by Solo & Kong is useful, but not a must-have by any means."
1,now i know how unintelligent i am,"After reading (and re-reading) this book, I began to realize just how insignificant my puny little brain is. This book definitely put me in my place, and brought my ego down a few notches. I barely made it past the introduction before being befuddled. I find it hard to recommend something i don't understand"
5,PHAT cd ! i love it :),"this cd is one of my favez ! its a really good mix of different genres of house music. number 7 is my fave... and number 15 thru out the end are the phattest hard house songs ever! its got some funky disco stuff...sum deep house...i dunno all i gotta say is that this cd rocks :) very dancable 2. Buy this cd if you love house music, you wont be dissapointed."
3,mixed bag...,"ok, this is a werewolf movie; so we know some bad things are going to happen to innocent people. For some reason, I think of werewolf movies as metaphors... in a ""when bad things happen to good people"" kind of way.What I liked about the film: I liked that it was filmed in black and white; it gave it a good ""suspense"" atmosphere. The lighting and the blocking of the actors and framing was really good. Unfortunately, the story was a little thin.Since it was made in the 60's, the language (verbage) is dated, and the dialogue was not interesting.The cinematography alone makes it a film worth watching."
1,Caution,"I suggest using this with caution. My daughter did enjoy it however, it can be dangerous if you have other children. My five year old pushed down on it while the baby was in it and hurt her legs. Thankfully, she was ok but I could easily see a babies legs being broken if a younger sibling trys pushing it down, which they all like to do as it makes the balls inside pop up."
5,"Great Item - Don't need another saucer, bouncer, etc...","This item, even though it's a ""travel"" item, is all you need. We received this as a baptism gift for our daughter and she started using it already at ten weeks. She is twelve weeks now and loves to stand and play. She's isn't hopping too much yet, but she loves the lights and sounds on the toy. She also LOVES to be in an upright position, so needless to say she loves to sit in the Hop N Pop so she can be upright. This is a must for all new parents. And you don't need a non-travel version, as this does the trick and is soooo easy to fold up and take down if you want to take it places."
5,A must have,I am really impressed with everything about this toy. Our 3 month old daughter loves it! She is to short to reach the ground so we place a towel underneath her so she can bounce. This is definitely a toy that she can grow in to.
5,Best gift of all!!,"I received this as a gift from my mother during my babyshower. My son liked the hop 'n pop from the first day that he got in it. He was about three months old. My husband thought he wasn't ready for it yet but when he put him in it he immediately started to smile. The only thing is that he was a little short for it. My husband put a telephone book under the foot mat and that unabled his feet to touch the floor. He started to hop and bounce and has been bouncing every since. Now he wants to jump while he's in it. His face lights up whenever he looks at his toy and when I take him out of it, he wants to sit in my lap and play with the toys.This has made my sons legs very strong and he is very alert and entertained by the hop 'n pop. This is the best gift that anybody can get for a baby. P.S. I'm not a kid, I'm 31 y/o. I just preferred to do this instead of registering."
4,"Fun, but less portable than advertised","This is a fun entertainment center and my baby likes it well enough, but the ""fold-up"" feature is NOT what I thought it would be. Yes, as a whole the unit is lighter weight and less bulky than most, and it does have a carry handle, but the folding feature only folds to about half it's regular height-- no where near flat. If you want something you can move from room to room, fine-- but don't expect it to fold up in a suitcase or fit compactly in a car trunk."
4,Works with my 4G and new Touch,"I've had this product for several years, and it has worked fine for me. Bought it for my 4G iPod, but it charges my new Touch too. Of course, I have to power this cable with an old FireWire 12V charger. It wouldn't help you charge a newer iPod if you only own USB accessories."
3,The Only Spice With Latin Flavour,"This single is the single in which you will find the remixes. The Junior Vasquez Main Pass Edit is by far the best remix on the single, it's a dance song, definately a song that when you close your eyes, you can see yourself out on the dance floor dancing yourself away with the sexiest latin girl. It's got a great beat, and has the Spanish interlude. The Bass Guitar is really good in here. The Charlie Papino 12"" Version is a remix that basically just repeats itself, but adds new background music each time the lyrics are repeated. This remix, Geri's lyrics are repeated in rhythm with each with a little ""latin"" sounding trumpet, not exactly, in my opinion, a good remix. Claudio Coccoluto The Coco Club Mix, is a sexual remix, that is not fit for my liking, it's a slower remix. It's got the Latin drum beats and marracas as well...however I think it's a little too sexual for my liking. However if you're a Geri fan..the first remix is probably one you would love!"
1,Don't ever buy this book,"This book is possibly the worst purchase I have made on Amazon. First off, it is erronously advertised: it is nowhere in the ballpark of being the complete works of Maupassant; it is a 220 page text (extra large print) of some of Maupassant's more mediocre short stories, like ""Ugly"" or ""An Artist's Wife."" Secondly, the translation is poor: 'Victorianized' for turn-of-the-century bourgeoisie, it reads nothing like Maupassant, and the power of his naturalist prose is all but obliterated.My advice: stick to the French, or find a newer edition/ translation."
1,Don't Buy this,"You can learn what not to do from this video. The instructor didn't have the right skill or experience enough to teach. Not to mention the poor quality of video. I watch for about 30 minutes, and that was enough for me to pack it back and shipped it right back to Amazon.com. Amazon.com charged me $17 for the return processing fee."
2,Our least favorite Spot book,"We have a big Spot afficianado in our house but this one missed the mark a bit from his parents' perspective. The story line about Spot asking and receiving lots of toys, falling out of a boat, and disturbing a hippo who repeatedly responds impolitely all create a tone that we'd rather not repeat six times a day with our little one (that's how often he asks to read it). All of these are small grievances, but we reach for a different Spot book when we can."
4,Makita 9.6V Battery,"During it's day no one could beat this set up. I have had this battery, and the drill it came with, since 1985 and it has never let me down."
1,Advertised as 10 pack,This was advertised on Amazon as a ten pack and that is specifically why I bought it.It is actually a one pack
2,"Interesting, but poorly organized and researched","While I love the idea of this book (and was looking forward to getting deep into its subject matter), the product itself was disappointing. The organization of the book is by topic, which ends up with the author running frequently from the 1950s to the present without segue and with lots of repeated information. It also doesn't help that the author often stereotypes the music in the same ways that the censors did; labeling Slayer's ""Angel of Death"" as a bona-fide ode to the devil is a wildly inaccurate misinterpretation (the song is actually about Josef Mengele's human experimentation at Auschwitz). While there is plenty of fascinating information to be found, Blecha spreads it out in a bland and tedious manner that it becomes all too easy to put the book down."
3,SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition,"This game is much better than the previous versions but still doesn't address the difference between cities, counties or states.I also deleted the game from my computer after spending a couple of hours to complete a city and the game just stops, exits without saving any work then puts you to the Windows screen. This happened three times, I then deleted the game and gave it to my kids for their computer. It also quit without saving when they installed and played the game on a different computer."
4,SIM CITY 4,"The game met my expectations and works well on my operating system. However, I am more excited about the new version expected to release in early 2013."
3,good game to play but will crash without warning,Always liked this game but does crash and freeze without warning. Still lokin for a patch but hear ther is a new game coming next year
4,"Wonderful, great! Except...","I loved this game. Period. It's great to have a game that is chock full of different paths to follow to your own varied definitions of success - ethical or unethical as they may be! The hours of gameplay are infinite if you are a creative enough soul. There are many reviews that talk about the details of the game I'm sure, so i just wanted to throw in another one that points out that the bigger and better the game, the more fuel it needs to run. I adored the game but my 4-5 year old laptop wasn't the hugest fan (though it ran it decently enough for me to write a good review). So if you are looking to have fast smooth gameplay, make sure you have a good system and read the minimum requirements (and then exceed them). All right, back to my rickshaw then."
1,Windows 7 + older games(Disc or download)=Wasted $15,"I should have heed the warning in the previous reviews,but impatience has eventually screwed me!DO NOT,and i repeat,do not waste your time,energy and $$$ on the download if you have Windows 7.It will never work.Tried HOURS of alternate methods and it is just not meant to be.First,the download took 90 minutes(broadband-then once i had it downloaded,could not install it.At least a dozen alternative ways from firewall settings to installing as administrative running,it just never worked.I even have the disc and i have cleaned my drivers,updated my drivers and got rid of a lot of useless files and still nothing.You can download it a million times and still get the non-installation.I think if i am gonna play another sim game,it had to be a 2011 game or newer.$15 down the drain."
4,Great Game,"Amazon provided fast and easy access to downloading the game. Thumbs up to Amazon.com! The only complaint with the game (no fault of Amazon but rather a flaw with the game itself) is that, unless you use a mod to generate tons of money, having a positive cash flow in a city's budget can be a very frustrating task. If you're a gamer who loves a tough challenge and a lover of sim games, I would highly recommend it. If you're new to Sim City 4 or sim games in general, you might want to consider downloading a mod to generate a high cash flow, otherwise the experience might be just frustrating more than anything else. Overall: a great game with a few minor flaws."
1,EA has quality problem,"I bought 2 copies of this game, neither of which had a 20-digit registration code included in the package. Evidently this is a well-known problem (as I discovered afterwards).EA clearly has a quality-control problem. I would recommend *against* buying any of their stuff ever.Oh, if I want to mail $10 to EA, write up my 'problem' I can do so. They will then determine if I'm worthy of a registration code (some weeks later). What a scam!!"
1,Will not install,"I can't install this game as it came with no registration number to unlock the cd and begin the installation process. Have contacted EA, but won't hold my breath!"
2,One of the most boring Similar City games ever!,"Don't waist your money. I had more fun on the Super Nintendo version. Its really not that great, very ho hum"
4,Nice open strategy game,"This game is great and you can find a lot of user-created content in the net to have more fun. Sometimes it can be frustrating at times but it's really nice to build your city (or region) from scratch and take it to very high levels, have a lot of people and let them live in wonderful urbanistic paradises or make their lives a living-hell in a terrible looking and badly planned metropolis. This game is never over, you can play and play and the fun will never stop... until SimCity 5 comes out..."
4,Sim City 4 Deluxe Edition,"I have loved Sim City ever since it came out for DOS system. The only problem I had with this program is that it did not install automatically after the download. I had to hunt for the program and then go through its text files to learn where its execute file was. After fixing the downloading issues, I got it running, and it is great."
4,"Fun game, frustrating at times.","This is a very fun and addictive game, my only complaint is the random crash to desktops. Im running Xp (SP 2) and have a fairly robust gaming computer. After about 2 hours of gameplay the game just crashed on me. No error message or anything. I have since patched the game from the Maxis website and save often. Haven't had another crash yet but may not have played for a long enough duration at one time. Otherwise this is a very nice update on SimCity."
5,SimCity 4 Deluxe,"I had gotten Sim City years ago and loved it. I recently purchased the boxed game in a store, but it would not work on my computer because my computer is a newer version now. I did not give up and looked on Amazon and found it for the version of windows I have as a download. I downloaded it and still had problems. Then I asked support and shortly they answered with help. I was very impressed and the game is up and running and great fun."
5,Great Book,"Read it and you will be happy that you did. Joyce has written many wonderful books, however, this and Battlefield of the mind are my personal favorites. She has many wonderful CD's available on her website that I also highly recommend. Love yourself and enjoy life!"
2,Horrible Binding,"I can't speak to the quality of the writing or photography yet, but I will say that despite buying this book brand new, and only thumbing through half on it once in the past week since I got it, several pages have fallen out and many more are in the process of coming out. I'm positive once I have to use it in class it's going to be reduced to a pile of pages. Seek out other versions of this book if you can. I figured that the parts of the binding I could see was done for effect.... until everything started falling apart literally."
2,More meditation than I'd like,"I bought this DVD after being very happy with Fat Free Yoga from the same people. This DVD has far fewer exercises than their Fat Free Yoga one, however. This one has about 30 minutes of exercise followed by about 30 minutes of meditation. One of those exercises goes on for 10 minutes so there really aren't that many different exercises. If you want a good workout, I would go with their Fat Free Yoga or Brian Kest's Power Yoga instead. If you want a lot of meditation stuff than this one could work for you."
5,One of the Best Yoga DVDs Ever!,"Long story short, Ana & Ravi have changed my life. If it weren't for their ability to so lovingly make their DVD's fun and accessible, there's no way I would've stuck with Kundalini Yoga (which helped me to successfully address serious life and health issues). Ana & Ravi are yogis in the truest sense of the word. They don't try to be all spiritual, but their DVD's resonate with soul and heartfelt concern for the people whom they are serving. Their programs are upbeat and fun and always inspiring. Kundalini Yoga Transformer is as about a complete workout as you could ever hope for. And believe me, there is nothing on You Tube which even comes close to the polish and pure devotion which this DVD demonstrates. If my words have inspired you to try this, be open to something new and different, and give it a few trys before you pass judgement. I am sure that your life will be transformed, just as mine was."
5,Great book!,What a great book. He put down in words everything that I believe about the changing landscape of marketing and new product development. This book will give you solid arguments for challenging the status quo.
5,Insightful and fun,"I rarely rate books with five stars. However, I believe that this book is a fascinating introduction to the entertainment world. It helps you open your eyes to new changes in our world."
2,"A good ""theory"" expanded to $24.95.","I only offer this review in order to add my 2 stars to the ratings and hope that the average number of stars drops. I wouldn't want anyone to buy the book based on the average rating.I would agree with some of the other negative reviews in that this book has an interesting premise that is reworked and reiterated many times over. Normally, I have highlights through out a book, but in this case I only needed to highlight the first three chapters. There was nothing new to highlightand after that.Good premise, but I'd invest in a summary of the book."
1,Positively Disappointed,"I bought this Wireless router from Radio Shack for $$. I brought it home about a month ago, and I have been having CONSTANT problems. I have to continuously reset the router, which is highly inconvienient, considering I must place it SO high up in the air for my wireless network card to even detect it. Getting ON the internet is a whole nother dilema. It takes me about an hour everytime I want to connect to the internet on my wireless computer, because it supposedly detects it, but I have no signal. On my wired computer, the internet is slower than my grandma, and sometimes, I dont even GET the internet and must continuously reset it. I am extremely disappointed, because my parents had bought this horrible piece of junk, and not given me the reciept. So, now I must settle for 60% of what I paid for it. EXTREMELY disappointed. Do not buy this, if you don't plan on wasting your precious time and money, even getting it to work."
2,lovely singer but bad production keeps this singer down,"first her voice is great but her managment and producers need to really think about backing this woman up who ever her label is they need to handle there artist with respect for making it or this minneapolis singer will be like the rest of the musicians that come out of the purple rained down city, standind in the shadows of prince i am also a artist who is signed to her record label and mr peter wright is a no sence bussiness man"
5,This CD makes Nine Inch Nails and others look bad!,"This cd is the ultimate in death/hardcore metal. I also love and listen to Metallica and others, but this cd makes em all look bad! why buy the same music withh all those foul words when you got a clean Christian one here! This groups even better than most others! Buy! Buy! Buy!"
5,The Best Of The Bunch,"Zao is the greatest hardcore band and this proves it. They have just been getting better and better. This album is the smoothest, the heaviest, and the scariest album they've ever made. Dan's voice varies in tone and depth in each track. The guitar parts are can be fast and intense, thick and heavy, or stunning and beautiful. Jesse's drums thud and pound. Both the Intro and Man In Cage Jack Wilson are brilliant; they don't put you to sleep. The best tracks are Savannah, Desire The End, and Ghost Psalm. Zao is the best. Liberate Te Ex Inferis is their best album."
3,An Alright video showing some of Smokey's high speed lunacy,"Honestly, I was expecting more from Smokey. He is a legend, after all. There are better videos of him on youtube that were not included on this DVD. Worth watching if you're a big a Smokey fan, or want to see what the owner of a multimillion dollar tuning company does for fun. He has big balls, and plenty of skills. He's a bit on the batty side, and is an interesting character - he looks like the should be pushing paper in a mid-management position... He's quite shy, yet he does some of the most insane stuff you'll ever see on the street. This - [...] is a perfect example of how insane he is, or maybe this (Just to show you what the Mid Night Club was all about) - [...]. I enjoyed the video but was hoping for more high speed clips and less downtime. Considering how cheap it is, I recommend it to any street racing enthusiast."
3,interesting to see exotic cars but it needs more actions,"interesting to see exotic cars but it needs more actions, and/or more details about the mods of the cars. This type of tapes are meant for car buffs, right? I didn't quite get that sense after watching it."
4,Exellent book!! :-),The book Mattimeo was an excellent mystery and adventure. If you have read any of his other books you can almost guess what is going to happen but then Brian Jacques throws in a new and exciting page turner. In this book (if you have read Redwall) you would have never guessed that Slager is...(I'll save the suprise) or why he wears the silk mask.
4,An epic adventure of the warriors of Redwall,I really liked this book. It was just what i would have expected from the sequel of Redwall. If you liked Redwall then you will definatlly love this book. The reason that I gave this book 4 stars was because the ending was lacking a few things. It just didn't seem like it was over.
3,"Fun, quirky novel","I really enjoyed this novel. I connected with the characters, was pulled around (in a good way) by the plot. A perfect beach read -- not complicated, but enjoyable."
2,Slow and tedious characters ...,"I had a very difficult time finishing this novel, although I did. It was very boring but my main problem is I did not care for any of the characters - mostly disinterest, but actually disliked Sandy, Cliff and Robin, the main ones. I truly did not care about their fates. Unlike some reviewers, I thought the science was tremendously simplified, not really that believable (except for the excrutiating detail on the lives and deaths of the mice) and everyone is so darn selfish the greater good seems utterly lost in this story (although perhaps that's the point). The hearings at the end are a bit interesting, but it's such slow going getting there, it's not worth the effort."
2,When Did This Take Place?,"I read this book in one day when I was sick in bed in Europe and couldn't get anything else in English. I'm not sure I would have finished it otherwise.I was aware of Allegra Goodman's reputation, but was disappointed in the writing and character development. Not bad, but no Jane Austen.For some reason Ms. Goodman chose to avoid all references to pop culture. As a result, there was no way to tell when the story took place. Obviously not in the present---------WHERE ARE THE CELL PHONES?"
2,not for scientists,"anyone who has a rudementary understanding of science should not read this book. it is childish, simplistic, and irrealistic. none of thee characters inlist your sympathy, only your pity. i had to force myself to finish it. can't believe it got 4 stars"
5,A Great Read,I found it difficult to Put his book down until I finished it. Life in a Research Laboraory became real to me because the author peopled it with chacters I could identify with and understand despite my having little scientific background.
2,It's a reprint- not a new book!,"Oops! I ordered this book months ago, thinking that it would be a new release, and I was quite looking forward to more Amelia Peabody. When it arrived, I can't tell you how disappointed I was that it was a very early Amelia- which I not only had already read, but I already owned a copy of. I was just going to ""suck it up"", assuming that I was the only one who hadn't read the description closely enough, but I see that I have company. You'd better believe that I'll read more closely in the future- and hope that others will too."
1,Disappointed,The Mummy Case (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)Stupid me...I was just doing a quick search and ordered this without looking too closely. Most people would have noticed that its a reprint with a new title.
4,Very revealing,"This book is a very revealing look at why the military does things the way it does. For example, many civilians do not understand the mindless brutality of basic training or the ultra-masculine culture of the military. This book puts everything into a real psychological perspective and explains why things are the way they are in the military. May be hard for civilians to relate to, but veterans will find this book very revealing."
2,Cuts into baby's leg,"I bought this because I wanted to try wool but was not crazy about hand washing. This was felted and machine washable, but it cuts into my baby's leg. Not worth it."
3,Pretty good book,"Book reveals some of the details of Cruise's Scientology involvement (probably unnecessary now, in the light of his recent flood of interviews) but is even more enlightening when the author tells how the cult tried to shut him up while he researched Cruise's membership in Scientology."
2,It's the Best Christmas Album/CD,"This is the one item we fought over when our household split up. We had to find extra copies because it means ""Christmas is here,"" to us. The mellow cool of Johnny's voice, with the lush orchestration and measured pace speak of a simpler time, before sentiment was considered in bad taste or cynicism had grown such deep post-modern roots. Recover your Christmas innocence and intensity! It's a five star experience."
5,Merry Christmas!!,You can never go wrong with Johnny Mathis and his singing of Christmas carols. This is one of my favorite albums and it most definitely begins to feel a lot like Christmas with his beautiful voice.
3,Little messy,My grand son has to play with it on the table but he still gets sand out of the box.He really loves it because he is into construction but it would have been niceIf they would have put a latch box door on top to put it away.
3,Broke immediately,"Within ten minutes of my 4 1/2 year old playing with this, the bulldozer broke. My husband put it back together as best he could, but it broke again a minute later, unfix-able. Our son was really excited to get it as a present, but I guess we have to buy different construction toys to go with it. It is nice that the good box it came in serves as a sturdy storage box for it when not in use."
4,Messy but fun!,"I bought this toy for my 2 year old. Yes, he loves it but I think it would be better for a 3 or 4 or even 5 year old. It gets quite messy but it's easy to clean up. There is a large piece of plastic that comes in the box that is handy to put beneath the sand box and it makes cleanup a lot easier. There are also many little pieces that are not good for small children. I have a 10 month old who puts everything in his mouth and I have to watch that he doesn't grab these little pieces. But overall, the whole point of the toy is that my child loves it and spends long amounts of time playing with it. He's very enthusiastic about construction equipment and he loves to play in the dirt so with this toy he has the best of both worlds!"
4,Good purchase for the price,"This is my 3rd pair of stands for my Onkyo speakers so I can now position all 6 of them perfectly. They are not as stable on the stand as I would like, as no adapter fit, but I cannot argue with the price. 3 of them are hidden behind my screen, so no chance of people walking into them, and the others are in the corners in the back of the room.Solid, lots of adapters to fit many different types of speakers (just not mine). I do have to note, they have some weight to them which I like."
2,"Decent, but not great for Onkyo speakers","Bought these and returned them. The build quality was decent, but there was no elegant way to secure my Onkyo speakers to them. I understand that it's probably hard to design a stand that's all things to all speakers, but I felt I should say that if you're looking specifically for stands for Onkyo speakers, which have a taller profile than most, you should know that these stands are not for you. Ultimately, I ended up going with the Onkyo AS140s--a bit more expensive, but worth it in my case.As an added note, I wish the Sanus bases had a little more weight to them. They were just a little on the unstable/light side for my taste, but then again this problem may vary by speaker model. In it's defense, I'd say that the provided hardware probably was comprehensive enough to secure just about any type of speaker footprint, but like me, you might find that you aren't fully satisfied with the results. Just my two cents."
3,Just OK.,"Let's just say I'm glad I didn't go with anything cheaper. The pole and base are good quality, but then use a little screw with a plastic head to maintain the height? It didn't break but I'm sure it would if you adjusted the height more than a few times. The speaker wire I used was a bit thick so it was a nightmare to run it through the pole but I wasn't going to cut another length to accomodate this stand. I don't mind but I'm sure my wife will comment on how the speakers seem to be slouching forward rather than being level. The carpet spikes seemed a bit over the top - I think they could be used in a deadly weapon if you're into that sort of thing."
5,Amazing cologne...,"This is just great stuff. Can't find it around much anymore... but, people are asking me about it every time I wear it."
2,"covers a lot of important things, just left out building web sites","this book covers topics like version control software and network architecture, but it leaves out the actual building part. I was hoping this book would cover some examples of software architecture and how/why it's scalable.Although this book touches on the mvc methodology, there is no connections made to how it makes an application scalable.I feel a little cheated to be honest"
2,Not recommended... and here's why!,"Cal Henderson writes what many call the definitive book on scaling websites... but unfortunately that's all it is, a book. Cal and his buddy Stewart Barfield (of Flickr fame) tried to use his scalability methods on a recently shut down flash game called ""Glitch"" from the company Tiny Speck. It was closed on December the 9th because it simply couldn't sustain more than 50 players in the same zone at the same time without unbearable lag for everyone involved. Quite the shame that he couldn't solve the scalability issues within his own company's game.Avoid this book because when it really counts, Cal Henderson's methods and techniques simply don't work in a real world situation."
4,A recommended read if you're new to production level engineering,"My development experience comes from university projects -- where you are often given a framework to work within and issues like security or real world performance are out of scope.I thought this book provides a very nice intuition behind a number of modules -- abstraction layers, coding practices, keeping a database clean, monitoring a site, etc and connects the dots between them.If any one particular area is of specific importance to you, you will probably need to get the deep details from another book or more likely a series of online documentation and websites. In my opinion though, this book covers what a physical book should -- enough to turn the lightbulb on in your head and show you some examples."
3,Just Ok,Tricky to use if you aren't a professional. Product is a bit sticky and requires a steady hand.
1,This was too thick,"This product was to this and became to tacky to fast. I don't know if there is a way for them to dilute it, but this was not useful to me at all. I had to stop after the first swipe and start with another product."
3,passes the smell test,"Though not quite as riveting and fascinating as its author probably thought it was, this is still a passably interesting tale of a young tech company founded more on dreams and possibiliy (thanks to venture capitalists) than tangible reality (during its four year existence doesn't seem to bring any product to the market). This reads as a perfect how not to run a business - borrow too much of other people's money and underestimate the competition (Microsoft plays the big bad villain here, but there are also jabs at IBM and Apple, probably undeserved) that might be forgiveable if Kaplan was some naive 21 year old techie at the start, but he wasn't (late 30s)."
3,To GO or not to EO,"I bought the book amidst lot of hype from my friends and relatives who have read this book. I didn't find it so exciting as to place it on the top shelf. This book definitely gives a very close encounter with the 'happenings in a corporation's entire life' in silicon valley. Some useful insights into how the industry works, which include dealings with Apple, IBM, AT&T, Microsoft are captured very well. Slightly boring in parts. And a completely one-sided view of the world, obviously."
3,Good but not a definate must,"The soundtrack starts of strong with the title track from the opening credits of the film 'Mary Mary'. If you've seen the film this is a good start and if not it's a rocking tune. The album progresses to get more moody featuring songs from Bjork and Massive Attack. The scoring of the film by Corgan is good but is rather repetitive. If you sat in the cinema thinking that the music was wonderful then this is for you, if not, borrow it off a freind and tape it."
2,Are you f***ing kidding me?,"Seriously. Are you f***ing kidding me? I gave this 2 stars ONLY because it's Devo songs. But seriously, Mothersbaugh - WTF?"
1,Even my monkey didn't laugh........,"In on the joke? Really? If it looks like s#@t, smells like s#@t, sounds like s#@t.......... This album reeks of betrayal. The cover should have been bright pink. BTW, I have two children and they listen to the real deal, not this s#@t, and they love it. Children don't need to be treated like pink-o morons."
2,Never Say Goodbye,"Rock Hudson, Cornell Brocher & Shelly Fabra made this film about Rock Hudson was in the Service He was a Doctor, He marries Cornell Brocher & they have a daughter who grow up to be Shelly Fabrea. They have an argument an she leaves the apartment, he takes the child at age 2 and they become seperated until Shelly becomes he age of eight.. It is a beautiful story and needs to be brought back. I have a copy of it that I recorded off AMC but would like to have it in dvd."
1,Never Say Goodbye,I was hoping to find the Rock Hudson/Cornel Borchers version!! This has always been one of my favorite all-time movies and I'm very disappointed to find it's not available. While I taped it years ago......I'd much rather have a DVD!
3,Origins,"It's always fun to see a writer grow. Doc Ford didn't spring, full grown, with that first story. As the author explains in the foreword, some needed money was raised the old fashoned way, pulp heroes. As many of the greatest writers did, White churned out a he-man adventure series, with plenty of knowing references to many of those writers. You'll have fun."
1,Not formatted for Kindle,"Read from a book this story is astonishing. Read from a Kindle and you will pull your hair out. Appears that whoever scanned this book, to Kindle format; used inferior text recognition software. The publishing house, grabbed an underpaid, bored, college intern; gave them the book, pointed at a flatbed scanner and put them to work. Sentences begin in lower case, 1 becomes i, Letter O becomes zero. Missing conjunctive adverbs, ""Miss spellings"", missing punctuation. Eventually you will learn to decode the translation. If I were the publisher I would be ashamed. More fuel for the make a fast buck and run world we live in. You paid $12 for that? I really need to call Amazon on this. Terrible. I want a refund.Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea, the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, November 13-15, 1942"
2,buy the book,"Book is well written. The kindle edition has hyphons (-) thoughout the book making for difficult reading. AND NO MAPS!!!! Buy the book enjoy the story, dump the kindle"
3,Not the Best,This book tells the story of the turnig point in the battle for Guadalcanal in World War II. I cannot recommened it. I feel that Morrisons and Frank's books about the campain for Guadalcanal both do a better job telling about not only this battle but all the battles in this struggle.
5,His best yet . He reached a whole new level.,"I have all of Spottedeagles CD's each one is better than the last. But this one, the music is full of so much love and sorrow that it pulls at the heart strings. His musical style will pull you in leading you on a inner journey to another place. A place where dreams can come true if only we believe. One person can make a difference and Spottedeagle is one of those people. I would highly recomend the CD ""Voices""."
5,One of the best movies ever!,"Set it off on the left ya, Set it off on the right ya, Set it off!!! (I love that song)! This was a must to add to my DVD collection. Great plot with Great actresses and MUST have!"
4,Great Movie with Stardome Cast,Set it off is a good movie to showcase Queen Latifah acting ability. It is an action packed film that a man can watch with his mate and not be mad.
1,does not work,I do not know how to return the product so I guess I am stuck with it. I tried to leave no stars clicked because I could not get the DVD to work but but the web sight would not permit me go to the next page without it. Please understand that the DVD does not deserve any stars.
4,it could be good,"I am looking at the third edition of The Yoga Tradition which has Copyright 1998, 2001, 2008 by Georg Feuerstein All Rights Reserved in the front. Its index ends on page 510. It is a big book, revised to include new translations of original source materials. A few places in the book encompass madcap ideas. In Chapter 2 I found a ""Yoga of hatred."" Some king hated Vishnu so intensely that in the process he achieved enlightenment. Passion breaks down the barrier between human personality and the divine Person. Divine splendor at endless shuddering of the worlds fills the universe with brilliance. Devotional pathos is praised for annulling the illusion of the ego-personality."
1,"I returned this to the store! There are other, better, releases.","This looks horrible! If you want to see Max Fleischer cartoons I re-direct you to the following sources:Koko & Inkwell cartoons: ""Out of the Inkwell"" DVD from Inkwell Images.Betty Boop cartoons: ""The Betty Boop Collection"" (out of print) VHS & Laserdisc from Republic Home Video.Popeye cartoons: to be restored & released by Warner Home Video on DVD in 2007.Color Classic's cartoons: ""Dancing On The Moon"" DVD from VCI Home Video."
5,Culpepper is godly,Culpepper is the man and so is this figure. I have a lot of these in my room. I recomend them to any big sports fan.
3,Sunshine,Well I got the roof in to the entertainment of my neighbors.the next door neighbor asked my why I didn't have it done at the factory.I managed to get it in without damaging the cross beams.I got hung up on the directions & & cut the roof liner to large.It looks good from the outside.I used lots & lots of sealer so it doesn't leak.My wife is happy with her sunroof so I am off the hook.
1,An Abomination of a Movie,Hollywood was just milking the success of the first (Which by the way should of never been made). Save your money and buy a different movie because kids will just see this once and forget about it. NOTHING MORE.
1,My Kids Hated This,"My two daughters begged me to take them to see this. Afterwards they were cranky and generally not fun to be around. I asked why and they told me, they thought it sucked and how they liked the first one. This movie is simply trying to ride the popularity of the first, and suck as much money out of a substandard project as possible. Don't pay to see this. Borrow it from people who buy it in shame, or use the vast possibilities offered on the internet."
1,"Unsuitable for children, or anyone for that matter.","What a waste of money. My 5 year old woke me up half way through only to tel me ""Daddy, make the terrible movie stop."" It would have been more entertaining and less traumatic to just throw our money in a fire."
1,I don't even know what i watched,The only context i could possibly enjoy this movie (?) in is one in which i am sedated at the dentist. Maybe.
1,Pure Brainwashing,Don't bother spending your money. This movie is nothing more than a brainwashing attempt by Hollywood. They try to evoke children's emotions by global warming as happening. I will be trashing the copy I bought so no one else experiences this pure trash.
1,Terrible,Terrible movie. Quite possibly the worst I've ever seen. It was actually offensive to me.I wish I could give it a negative score.
1,Terrible,"Terrible. That's the only word I can use to describe this movie. Nobody in my family, not even the younger kids liked it. The music and dancing were also a bit suggestive and I wish this had never been made. And they call this a kids movie."
1,"Really, just awful!","I worked in a movie theater when this was showing. Needless to say, I saw it for free... I still asked for my money back... Slow pacing, musical number were boring, predictable ending. Just bad."
1,Do not want,"Happy Feet Two is an incredibly awful movie, PLEASE do not waste your money on this garbage! Your kids will hate it."
1,meh,"This must the worst movie ever made. Even Ed Wood has some better movies than this garbage. If you want to throw money away, buy this movies."
5,Loved it!,My children are all grown up but I absolutely loved this movie. It is a sweet and wonderful family movie. It leaves you with a light and wonderful mood. I am definetly recommending this movie to everyone adults and children!
1,Worst movie ever!,"Save your money and try something else. This movie was awful. I would never see it again. Horrible, just horrible."
1,Waste of money and time,"First one was great and very funny, but this one just sucks.They stretched the story out too much when they really should have ended it with the first movie. the humor is bland, the musical magic is gone, and it's just plain garbage.DO NOT even waste your time and money on this trash. Straight to the trash bin."
1,I want my money back,I liked the first one but this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i want my time and money back DO NOT WATCH!
1,terrible,"Aimless wandering plot, indiscernible purpose to the story. It has nice graphics, but that's about it. Vastly inferior to the original."
1,Horrible video!,"Worst video ever seen!Please don't watch this. Bad actors, bad voices & not recommended! Have seen more movies from this company and they really have started to suck lately. Don't buy this on DVD."
1,Better movies for my kids,"There is so much better out there. Save your money and find something worth the money. I rely on these types of reviews on amazon. Believe me, you can do much better with other animated films!"
1,Crappy Feet POO!,Sorry Crappy Feet POO really is just a dumb movie. Don't waste your money.What where they thinking? I mean REALLY!
1,Really bad,I bought the 3d Blu ray version of this movie....it was SO boring...I forced myself to make it past the first 20 minutes....I never got what the story was about....nothing interesting ever happens...the two krills are stupid to say the least....the music was annoying....the 3D was the worst I've seen...so much ghosting it made me dizzy....I couldn't wait for it to end....I will use the disc as a coaster for drinks....don't buy this...caca.
1,Dissappointing,Terribly disappointing film I wouldn't recommend it at all save your money. Really the movie industry needs to re invest some of its billions of dollars profits into making some decent movies
1,terrible movie,Boring. I kept hoping someone would shoot me in the head to stop the gooey feelgoody horror.Please do not see this abomination.
5,Awesome Sequel,this movie is awesome. i thought that this movie was just as good as the first movie. happy feet two had more of a storyline that the first but i thought that they both are really good. in all honesty if they make another movie they probably ruin it. so i hope they don't. but if they do i will see it anyways. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
1,Ok Saturday morning flick from a T.V. but not from a theater,"I've never ever feel like a total fool for purchasing tickets to watch a movie ever in my life before... But that was exactly the feeling I had when I watched this with my niece. Personally I wouldn't write a review on a movie where my niece was the one picking out the flick to be seen, but to be told personally from a 7 year old that she ""really really want to go"" after 30min into the movie, just blew my mind away. A movie that's aimed for youngsters, and to be told she's bored out of her mind, which I personally agree, was all I needed to leave the theater with her."
1,Extremely bad.....,"Saw this in the theater. Extremly poorly made. Mudane, and boring. I could tell even my son started losing interest in this movie about 20 minutes into it. If you're looking for something to watch with your kids, look elsewhere. This one is just so poorly made, it's almost unbearable."
5,"Great flick, ignore the trolls","There is one reason and one reason only for all the negative reviews, right wing trolls. For all I know it's just one guy who has spent several days doing this. If you click on ""my other reviews"" next to the negative reviews, almost all of them have never reviewed anything else. That is because that account was created for the SOLE reason of marking down Happy Feet Two. Why? Because of a very vague environmental message you really have to search for to even see. They're doing the same thing to The Lorax right now and that type of behavior is really dispicable.Rest assured, Happy Feet Two is a great kid's movie. It's at least as good as the first one with Matt Damon and Brad Pitt adding a whole new dimension to the story and causing me to laugh out loud several times. The CGI is beautiful, the characters are fun and there's just as much singing and dancing as the first film. the 3D is also fantastic if you get that version."
4,Not as bad as the reviews suggest!,"I have 3 children between the ages of 3 and 10 and I had major surgery a little over a month ago so we have watched more animated films in the last month than ever before! This movie is one the kids keep asking for again. I'm sure it won't become a classic in our home but it's worth a ""few"" viewings!Anyway, to each their own, but in my opinion it's worth a chance!"
4,Fun movie!,"Not sure why all the negative reviews. I found it as fun as the first one, and I loved the use of the 3d. Bravo to the cast...love the voices."
2,Saw it in Theater,"I saw it in theater happy feet two. I didn`t like the little penguin peeing upside down in the movie. but I saw it at a cheap movie theater with my girls and it was ok for only paying 10 bucks for the 3 of us. I would only buy this on DVD when it goes on sale for 5 dollars, its not worth paying full price."
1,Dreadful!,This movie is terrible compared to the first I strongly advise you and your friends to keep them away DO NOT BUY THIS DVD
1,Embaressing,"Note to the studios and the powers that be that financed this piece of trash:Find another line of work that has nothing to do with animation, animals, music, entertainment industry or any path that might inadvertantly cross those of us who paid to see your lack of talent, concern or what passes off to some as ""ability.""To everyone else:Do not see, pay or even think about this movie."
1,NO...JUST NO!,I would rather of used my money to buy a knife to stab myself in the heart with than watch this movie. Yes it was that bad. Babies will cry because it was that bad
1,Happy Feet Two Review;,"This movie was incredibly redundant, it's supposed to be a children's movie yet when me and my kids went to see it, we all were not impressed. The penguins weren't even cute!!! I really do not recommend this film."
2,B-o-r-i-n-g,All I can say it that lots and lots of repitition. Weak story line and did not hold my interst or my granddaughter's.
1,Wasted my time. PERIOD.,"This movie is not recommended for anybody and any age. It will literally leave you thinking of how horrible it was that it will terrorize your well being anywhere you go. So please, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!"
2,World disaster against ourselves,"This movie show us how we are damaging our world and how is making pain against ourselves because we are affecting our nature day after day about the movie some times you are going to feel sleepy about 3D video with ghosting but good gimmick and audio strong those could be you feel happy.If you are a 3D fan like me buy it, if not rent it first and decide later."
1,"Boring, too much Drama","This movie is not that funny as expected, esp. not for children. In addition, there is too much drama esp. for a movie like that. Sometimes it was boring and i was happy as the movie was over."
1,Not as Charming for kids as the original...Terrible!!,"Happy feet 2 is terrible and is not as charming and hilarious as the first one, please reconsider if planning to but to your kids; or maybe you are just an adult with weird likes and you seriously want to see it, avoid it!!!! Films are going down, not good stuff anymore. better if I read a book."
1,Terrible movie,"Movie was terrible. Do not recommend. Whatever you do, do not buy this movie. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY!"
1,HORRIBLE.,"I went to go see this ""movie"" and wasted my time with this! I was begging for the movie to end! The animation was horrible and it looked like they rushed it. The story,plot,conflict,ending were all noncomprehending and I wouldn't imagine a child following through with this! Within ten minutes of the projected movie, I saw many kids asking their parents what was going on! When the movie started ""Eric"" immediately abandons his parents and goes with his friends! What is this film suggesting?!?!? Bottom line is, don't see this movie. The only part you will like is the ending credits."
1,Pretty garbage...,"I kinda liked the first one, but this one was a lackluster, uninspired, forced sequel that was obviously just a cash-in for fans of the first one. As an almost fan of the first one, I was beyond disappointed."
1,Incredibly boring movie.,This is a very boring movie. The humor is very bland and corny even for a childrens film. There are plenty of better movie out there. This is one to skip.
1,Terrible,"Awful just pure garbage, not only was it cheesy and vastly over rated. Do not waste your time or hard earned cash on this piece of garbage."
1,Don't Watch This!!!!,This movie was soooo horrible. I can't believe how much of a waste of money it was going to see it. Save your money!!
4,Translation PLEASE,I really wish I could read this book in the original language. The lines and large phrases of thought are incredibly broad stroked and give a wonderful third dimension to the flow of the book. But there is a problem - the language (and perhaps the author would chide me on the use of the word here) is often grammatical stilted. Can someone get this woman a better translator? A jewel of a thinker and a brilliant intellect.
3,Where's the beef?,"This is not a bad book for book one in the series... unfortunately there isn't a series. First and formost the topics should have been broken up into two separate books. ""Maxscript"" and ""MAX SDK"". It's not bad but it doesn't help you ""Master"" anything. It's just a good introduction to script writing and a smidgin of the SDK."
4,Not for the faint-hearted casual user of MAX,"Aimed at advanced users who need complete control over 3D Studio MAX, this manual teaches the black art of MAXScript writing. The last third of the book also covers the Software Developers Kit (SDK), which enables you to design your own plug-ins.If you have no programming experience then Mastering MAXScript was designed for you. Through over 11 chapters, which begin with a basic overview and conclude with a look at MAXScript extensions, you'll be able to gain unprecented control over MAX R3 and its previous versions.On the other hand, if you want to make the most out of the SDK you'll need knowledge of C++ (MAX' native language) and Win32 programming. Not for the fain-hearted."
1,call this a text book,"Each chapter on has a couple of examples with minimual calculations, diagrams are unexplained and what topics that are explained are without diagrams. There are no solutions to any problems and typos are everywhere, including formulas. They can't even get the formula for equivalent capacitance of capacitors in series correct."
5,Fascinating Study of US History,"Before I read this book, I knew very little about the post-Revolutionary War/pre-Civil War period of American History. While I am very interested in the former but not the later, I felt I needed a better understanding of what was going on in American politics that led the country to Civil War. This book delivers. Yes, it's long, but it needs to be to cover all of the important events from 1800 to 1860. The author does a great job showing the tranformation of the country, highlighting the growth of the Democratic movement from small local groups to the Democracy of Andrew Jackson. Additionally, Wilentz does an excellent job of highlighting the growing differences between the North and the South, politically, economically and socially. I now feel as if I have a true understanding of why we slipped into Civil War, and how the events of this time period still resonate today. A highly readable account of US history that I still refer too."
2,12 secrets ingredients of krisp kreem do nuts..,This is not a book that give you any instructions about donuts just how a company scored big in the market..and it was written before the company went to one of the lowest on the stock market..
1,Don't bother picking this one up.,"Reading this book, I was so aghast at the awful writing that I hardly remember what the plot was about. The only reason I forced myself to finish was because I had paid money for the book. I've learned two important lessons: First, next time I find a book at the used book store which looks ""new"" I'll know its because the book was so bad the previous owner didn't read it. And second, no more Rita Mae Brown! Anybody who was a fan of her older works should look else where."
4,Another great Mrs. Murphy book,"During a tough winter very much like this one, the residents of Crozet have cabin fever. Interest turns to the local hospital when one of the employees gets murdered. Local legend has it that the hospital was once a stop on the Underground Railroad. Surprizing as it may seem, all of these elements combine to make a really entertaining mystery novel. I love the talking animals and the local characters."
4,Firefighter cake candles,"These candles are really cute and are great for cakes or cupcakes. There are only four in the set, boots, hat, dog and fire hydrant but you can add regular candles."
4,Spy Kid,"Li'l Harriet is an aspiring author,and she keeps a journal,a spy journal,in which she writes down her opinions on everything that is happening around her.Sadly,she has written some pretty mean things about her friends.She thinks she is just being funny,but when her pals see the journal,she is left friendless.They are so mean to her that she plots revenge on every single one of them.That's when her parents send her to a psychiatrist!!Will HArriet get her friends back and her life back to normal?Find out.By Linda.Bye."
4,Great book,"I needed to have a book that outlined the syntax for the coding of Perl. This was an excellent book to give me the basics of Perl. I have recently taken over the support of some software developed in Perl. I have Fortran, Basic, and other software knowledge, but need Perl specific information to debug software written in Perl."
3,Good book--but getting a little long in the tooth,"This review is for the second edition of this book.Learning Perl is a good book for beginners. But alot has changed since 1997 (when it was published). If you want to learn the ""basics"" of Perl and are just gonna play around with Perl, this is one of the books for you. If you need to learn Perl for use in a production environment, you should look at some of the newer O'Reilly books on Perl. This book is just too old and outdated for me to give it more than 3 stars"
4,Great for aspiring Perl programmers,"If you are new to Perl, this is the book you should go for. It provides an entertaining and thorough stroll through the language. If you are quite familiar with this type of language (like C, C++, or scripting languages) then you should acquire Programming Perl (but then, you should buy that book in any case). I bought both Learning Perl and Programming Perl, and I have not regretted Learning Perl at all, because of its great tutorial ability."
4,Decent book for an undergrad class.,"The book, like most O'Reilly books, is clear and useful. It is only an intro though, so don't think it will get you trough if you need to do something non-trivial in perl. The main reason I'm writing the review is to counter what another review said about Perl itself: that it is pointless and you can just use shell scripts insted and save time. Unless your just writing a simple 20 or 30 line program you don't want to be writing shell scripts. They are very slow, can have hard to debug run time errors, and have a messy and often cryptic syntax. Perl is fast and compiled and does lots of stuff replacing Bash and many Unix utilities."
4,This book defines Beginner's Guide,This book is the ultimate Beginner's Guide to Perl. It gives you everything you need to get started and excludes everything else that could get you confused. I took off 1 star as well because I agree that it is not a good reference.
4,Excellent Beginners Guide to Perl,"If you are new to Perl this is the book for you. The syntax and usage examples were great and timely! You actually get to apply what the authors are trying to convey with the exercises at the end of each chapter. The authors are also nice enough to throw in some basic cgi programming material. However, this book is designed just for what it says ""Learning"". This is by no means a reference book for Perl nor is it a place to learn basic Unix commands. It will be a while before I auction this one off."
4,For Twice the Price Go Buy The CD With All 6 Books,"If you are serious about learning and using Perl, buy the CD. Go search for it on Amazon- ""The Perl CD Bookshelf"". Read my review on the CD.Otherwise, this is a solid book for learning Perl. However, some newbies may find it a little too advanced. I would suggest starting with ""Perl & Cgi: The Visual Quickstart Guide"". It will get you on your feet quickly. Then advance to this book, or the CD, or even both."
2,Not an Inro Programming Book. For Unix Gurus Only.,"I do not understand the high marks this book gets.It is not an intro programming book. It presumes the reader already has substantial UNIX and programming experience.You will learn little or nothing unless you are already versed sed, awk, shell programming etc. Do you know what ""@ARGV"" is?There is a crying need for a genuine intro Perl book. Written by somebody who does not present Perl knowledge as an esoteric art but rather one which attempts to communicate information. This is not it."
4,A great book for beginners.....,"I was scared to death of this language, but after reading the first six chapters, I am actually enjoying the learning process associated with Perl. This book builds on examples, and gives you helpful quizzes at the chapter ends. This book was recommended to me by a friend in programming, and anyone interested in learning Perl, should start with this book....Excellent Book!"
5,Some of there songs have corny lyrics,I really like this CD.I got it for christmas and some of there songs like summer girls and parts of girl on tv have corny lyrics that don't make sense.They are just trying to make fun of those things to be funny.Well anyway I have there album and the rest of the songs are not like that so dont put them down if you have only heard summer girls and girl on tv.I know if you give them a chance and lissen to there album you will know that they are not that corny.There songs are butifull and so are there voices.If you give them a chance you will not regret it.trust me.
1,There's no excuse for this.,"Why did they write this? Chinese food? Abercrombie & Fitch? Paul Revere? It certainly doesn't make any sense, and it isn't funny, so I suppose the only possible reason for lyrics like this is pure and unadulterated evil. It's insubstantial nonsense, so how does it manage to alienate me so much? Evil, I tell you! LFO will sneak into your house at night and take your children! Don't let their mephistophelian plot reach fruition - avoid this CD."
2,Rhymes About As Sick As They Come,"Somebody really should have introduced these boys to the old school. Loaded on cliche hip-hop inuendo and lame brain lines like ""Michael J Fox was Alex P Keaton"" and ""Dooby doo-wop and scooby snacks"" this record rates as one of the most embarrasing pop concoctions ever made. But give these boys credit, they do arrange and write their own music, and the actual music isn't too bad.. But this record lacks direction and a producer who could channel the well-intentioned band and edit the painfully hard to swallow lyrics that will undoubtably drop your I.Q. 100 points with repeated listen. A fad and nothing more.. But enjoyable none the less.."
1,The worst of the boy groups,"As expected, EVERY song on this album is a cheesy, love ballad. So ""Summer girls"" is actually dedicated to someone, and was written by the group. But all this seems to make it EVEN WORSE than BSB, N Sync, or 98*. At least KoRn turned A.D.I.D.A.S. into a catch phrase, LFO singing about A&F is nothing but sellout! What if a girl preferred GAP, would you still like her guys? Unbelievably PATHETIC!"
1,Music's nemesis,"L.F.O.'s lyrics on Summer Girls just don't fit together at all. And really, the lyrics don't even represent a summer theme. The lead singer sounds like he's in a state of sleep. The other songs also don't add anything but defamation to the influences that they have. I thought 'N Sync and 98 Degrees were bad, but L.F.O. can beat them all in ripping-off the public."
1,This group and their cd is a disgrace! =(,"This cd will be a waste of your money or your parents money. I never liked Summer Girls but I still bought the cd thinking it would be a good investment and maybe that they would have some better songs. Man was I WRONG! I only gave them one star because I can't give them ZERO! It's pitifull, they can't sing and they surely are NOT hot! To the girl who said it changed your life, I say ""Yeah Right, Whatever"". My little brother can make better lyrics and he's only 7. Please do not buy this cd unless you want to waste it on trash. What has happened to the good taste of some American teenagers? Invest your money in a group who can really sing and have the lyrics and melodies to go along with it get the Imajin self-titled cd. It'll be well worth your money. Unlike Lyte Funky Boys, what were they thinking of when they came up with that name! The only thing in their name that is true is Funky, because that's what they are."
5,"""West Side Story""","Hi my name is Ashley and I would like to reccomend LFO's CD. My favorite song is ""West Side Story"". Ijust love they're music and highly reccomend it to the teenage populace."
2,what the *beep* is this!!,"the only good song is sumer girls, well the only one i like but all the songs sound alike and they don't know how to sing!!!!! good lord eeeekk!!"
1,How did it get to this?,There is no reason to re-iterate all the bad things people have been saying about this album. I personally think that even giving them 1 star vastly overstates the musical talent of LFO
3,Weirdo's But still cool,"Why are they weird? What the hell is alex be kicking, what do they have against chinese food, what's scooby snacks and salty cheese. Well there still cool because it's rap."
3,Cool,"This is a cool CD, not the best. Some songs are dumb. And what LFO stands for is kinda stupid. Agree or not? E-mail me at USAchick81@hotmail.com thanx!"
1,SUCKS (did not deserve the 1 star),"At first I thought this CD might be somewhat cool, but, upon wasting my money on this group I knew otherwise. The lyrics are completely irrelevent and make no sense with the verses before it. Do not waste your time or money of this MTV marketing propoganda."
4,Two Thumbs Up,"Personally, I think this CD. is very good. I love ""Girl on T.V."" which I think is very pretty. ""West Side Story"" is also very good except for the awful rap that in my opinion ruins part of the song. ""Summer Girls"" is also a great song, but goes on to long. They all have good voices. I tend to not really like the raps though. LFO is a great band. But it is going to be hard for them with competition like the Backstreet Boys, 98 degrees and the awful, awful N'Suck behind them. Go LFO!"
3,Its okay,"I first heard this song on the radio on the way home. It was a catchy tune and when I found out what they looked like, I was really all googoo-gaggag. I was really into them and I even voted for them 50 times on MTV(which is probably why they are up there now.) After a while though, the song kind-of....well...got boring...They are really cute and everything, but I think I'll stick to my first band, Backstreet. If you really want to waste your money-buy the CD. If you still don't have money-but want the CD-get the single(which is what I did.) And good thing, too, because theres only 2 songs I actually like on the CD,(courtesy of my friend-who ran out and bought it first thing.) =) If you love pop-you'll love this, and if not, well, then don't buy it-simple as that!!!"
3,Nice album.,They have nice harmonizing on this album. They don't just have the poppy-beat hits. They have a couple of slower songs as well. And Rick O'Connell is SO cute!!!! (He's the blonde guy in the middle of the group on the front cover)
1,Remastered? Anything But!,"I bought this because it said ""Remastered"" on it. NOT! Well, maybe it was remastered from one of the old four-track or eight-track car stereo cartridges we used to play his music from when it first came out. Surprised that my fiftysomething ears could actually hear the distortion, I loaded ""Atlantis"" into my WAV editor (Audition) so I could map the waveform. The second portion of ""Atlantis"" has more clipping than a late-model Tom Waits album. At least I can picture Waits having a reason for introducing this much distortion into his songs. The only thing I can think of for Donovan is that it's a way subtile of dropping hints about the nature of the claims on the album cover about this CD being remastered."
4,Essentially good,Most of his best songs are here but there are a few I've never heard before and am learning more about this excellent artist each time I listen.
5,Terrific Investment Banking Reference,"I purchased this on the advise of a professor with over 20 years experience in the banking industry. It is the best reference text that I have come across in a long time.I recommend this book to any MBA student who is pursuing a career in investment banking. This comprehensive reference describes investment banking concepts and practices in a manner that is clear and easy to understand. It has been very relevant to the real-time, case-based instruction at my MBA program. Buy it and save yourself a few trips to the full time associate's cubicle this summer, or at least gain a basic understanding of a complicated topic before you go running for help."
4,"Nice to have, but....","if you have time, you can make yourself a set of these with 4x4. These things are handy when you clamp things like frame, cabinet door or even small window frame like I did recently (I have 40"" and 50"" Bessey's). They hold the clamps level and square once set. But if you have a dado blade, you could make yourself a set of these with 2x2 or 4x4 blocks and save some money. It seems to me only one slot being used at a time, so you don't have to cut two parallel slots on the same block only two perpenticular ones, one deep one shallow."
1,Early American Cookery,The book is interesting. I enjoyed seeing how they measured and found some different receipes. I am very pleased with the book. I also liked the way they told other housekeeping hints.
1,"Pryor is great, DVD sucks",This DVD is a travesty. This is one of the great stand up comic shows of the last 50 years and yet the DVD sound track is off by so much that it is distracting. Stay away. Perhaps the VHS tape is better.
1,Richard Pryor - Live In Concert,"Richard Pryor's comic genius is ever apparent in this DVD. His scenarios and timing are just guaranteed to create tears from laughter. However, the quality of the DVD was extremely poor. There is shadowing around Pryor and the audio track is way off!"
3,Great game but you can't save,"Highly addicting, an intriguing story unfolds as you solve each level. The biggest bummer here is that you can't save your game! And so if you exit, you have to start all over again from the beginning, reading the same story segments.I can't understand how the game developers could miss out such very basic feature! Nuts."
5,DONT HATE....THEY THA BOMB!!,"I THINK THE GROUP ""IDEAL"" IS THE BOMB!! THEY LOOKIN' GOOD AND THEY BLOWIN' UP. YA'LL DONT HATE....THEY WORKIN IT."
4,Very Interesting!,"To be honest, the only reason I bought Ideal's album was because I couldn't get enough of that song ""Creep Inn"". I love that song to death, but the rest of the album is good too. Some of the songs kind of sound the same, but one of the reasons why you don't notice this is because THE BOYZ CAN HARMONIZE! You can't find too many goups out there who can sing together and sound good doing it. Ideal is definitely a group to look out for."
3,Not a bad effort,"When I bought Ideal's cd a while back, I hadn't heard a single song off of it. But everyone was talking about these guys being the next big thing and that the song ""Get Gone"" was real hot. So i bought this album expecting a little too much I guess, cause when I gave it my first listen I wasn't all that impressed. Some of the songs are just plain, with little emotion, and I feel that Maverick just doesn't have what it takes to be a lead vocalist. However, there are some bright spots on this one. I just love the songs ""Creep Inn"" and ""Jealous Skies"". ""Get Gone"" although not what I hoped for, is still very respectable and I can see why it was a hit. It sort of reminds me of a lot of the songs on R. Kelly's last album ""R"". I know a lot of R&B fans will enjoy this album, so i really depends on one's taste's. I'm more of a Jodeci, New Edition, Jagged Edge man myself."
4,Special finishing touches,"With the Schulte products purchased through Amazon, I know this project makes our home even more personalized and special...this has been an ongoing project set to perfection. With all the components we've purchased makes it a step closer to my dream closet. With all the products offered by Schulte and Amazon, a wide variety of personlization make it yours. The Rod Stop purchased completed the area with the right finished look...and safety."
5,Deep Comfort,"A landmark work of healing for those facing life-threatening illness. Graceful Passages is a work of the highest integrity that provides the deep comfort and solace of wise words and heart opening music for the often uncharted waters of attending the dying. By featuring the voices of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, Zalman Schachter-Shalomi and the others, it provides soothing support offered by a whole sacred circle of mentor guides available at any hour of need."
2,Depressing,"I found the music and spoken words on the first CD slow and depressing, but it does have a lot of different spiritual views.Maybe listening to the 2nd CD, music only, would be better.The book has the spoken words in text form, and actually read better than they sounded."
3,Read this book for SNMP and simple OSPF/RIP implementation,"This book consists of a TCP/IP stack core protocol implementation on a XINU OS. Yes, book is good but I will recommend to refer TCP/IP Illustrated volume 2 because that has an actual BSD 4.3 implementation (though old code).Illustrated book does not cover the OSPF, RIP and SNMP implementation. This book does that so we can refer this book for that purpose.In some portions of the book, the Author has not completely explained the code properly."
5,I'm hooked,i read the first book in this series and couldn't wait to continue. I've got all 5 and hope Jerri Corgeat keeps writing more.The characters are intesting and complicated but things tie up neatly-just the way i like it.
4,"Fashionable, yet good perfomer Bluetooth Headset","Very simple to pair, and use. Works excellent with the voice recognition feature of the phone to place calls. Too bad the seller sent me a white one instead of the advertised BLACK. Fits great, doesn't fall, battery could last longer."
3,Decent headset,"I bought this headset to replace the Samsung WEP200 I was using for my PS3. I just couldn't figure out a way to get the Samsung to fit in my ear comfortably, and the HBH-IV835 does just that.Pros - Comfortable, small, light, haven't had a problem with it picking up background noises, you can't control the volume (it's supposed to be automatic) but I've never needed it to be louderCons - Ear bud has too much give and has fell out a few times, the headset itself slides in the ear bud so it spends 97% of the time resting against your cheek (more annoying than anything), short battery life (maybe 3 hours?), about double in price from when I got it a few months agoIt's not a bad piece, but I'll stick to wired headsets."
4,Sony Ericsson HBH-IV835 Bluetooth Headset,This is a great headset! I have had no problems with it and I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in getting a new bluetooth headset.
4,great headset if you wear glasses,"i'm sure others have trouble as well when moving around that the headset can come off, but if you're a glass wearer, in-ear is the way to go. having dropped it several times, it's still working fine so it is quite durable.battery life isn't fantastic, but for such a small product it's acceptable. wish it would charge via usb rather than the custom charger.i would buy this product again."
2,"Easy install, hard to see cars","The replacement head was very easy to install, but the mirror itself doesn't provide anywhere near the same angle of view as the old one. It is going to take a lot of adjustment...until I find a better replacement. Also, it's made of plastic, not metal."
2,not what was delivered,there was no sp2 with this package. I downloaded it from the website. The instructions are not sufficient for the install. The delivery was 4x longer then they said it would be. The activation code is 45 numbers.....are you kidding me....
2,Disaster,"Microsoft's Windows XP Professional is one of the better alternatives out there when it comes to O/S. Of course, Linux is for free, and it is much more stable that Windows. However, if you are not a geek like me, it is likely that you will find Linux Ugly, and hard to use. Solaris is just a no-no for a desktop user because it is even more frustrating than Linux. Mac OS on the other hand is in the class of its own. I am not going to start arguing what is best, but unless you are a Mac Lover, which as Howard Stern says are, ""last of a dying breed,"" then you are better off getting this product. Get the professional version though since it has desktop remoting and much more useful stuff. Now, why 2 stars? For me, Security is the most important thing, and I hate to download zillions of patches everyday just to cover .0001 percent of security holes that Microsoft has left in its O/S. Vista, looks beautiful though. Not sure how the security is improved?!"
1,"Big handle, small blades","I have been looking for a nice pair of take apart scissors for a while now. Kind of like the type seen on a episode of Good Eats. I thought these might fit the bill. They don't.Serrated? No. For something to be serrated the actual blade needs to have serrations, not just some fancy cuts on the side (non cutting part) of the blade. How that can be called serrated I do not know.8 inches long? Yes, they are. Which if you look at the picture you will see the handles are quiet big. Nice right? Well half right. Big handles are nice, but in a 8 inch long item only a couple inches are left for the working part of the blade. It is like cutting with kids scissors. This is something I didn't think of till they came and actually saw them in real life.If you are looking for a good pair of come apart scissors keep looking."
3,So.. So.. Toy,"Good:1)Sensors on the play mat , touch the animals and hear them.2) Nice Colorful washable matBad:1)Not exactly as shown in the pic.2) Butterfly, Tree and Turtle once inserted into the slot cannot be taken out.3) Mat bit small than what i expected, may be i din see product details properly."
3,For the TRUE fans....,"I bought this DVD because I've worn out the original VHS copy I bought back in '86. The sound quality is good, not great, GOOD. The video quality is not the best. I expected better from some a high quality band. It literally looks like they copied it straight from someone's VHS copy. If you are a casual listener of Van Halen, borrow it from someone. This one is for the Van Halen Fanatic."
3,A Classic,I only wanted this dvd because I had it on VHS at one time many years ago. It's a classic. The quality is fair but it's a lot of fun. The seller was outstanding! I thought the dvd was going to be used and it was only opened but brand new!
3,The beginning of a long falling spiral,"New Halen indeed. It was obvious Sammy had a big pair of shoes to fill. I think it's evident here that he was trying too hard to upstage Dave instead of being himself. Of course when he is himself he's nothing short of obnoxious. If there's one thing you can say about Sammy it's this.... Why oh God why didn't he have someone do something with his hair? His clown 'fro just looked ridiculous the more you saw it.Michael Anthony's bass solo was sub-par. I've seen Gene Simmons do better bass solos and that's really saying something. Alex, perhaps the ugliest man in rock keeps it tight I'll admit that, and Eddie proves he is a guitar hero to be reckoned with. But the Van Halen 'feel' just isn't there. I'm sorry and many will disagree, Sammy never fit in with Van Halen, and when he was the singer it just wasn't Van Halen. Much like Ozzy leaving Black Sabbath."
5,Great act these guy's had.,ENERGY! Pure & simple energy to the MAX. These guy's are fricken crazy on stage & have tons of fun at the same time. 51/50.......
3,Very interesting - but end is somewhat internally inconsistent,"Making HistoryJust finished the book in one continuous reading taking breaks only for eating sleeping etc.etc. Couldn't put it down. Love almost all of it - yes, ""almost"" is the word, because, I am a bit disappointed with the end. Bringing Steve over to Cambridge seemed to me to be internally inconsistent. If he really wanted to do that, then there should have been at least a hint of a character like Steve already present in Micheal's world, just as Mikey was present in Princeton in Steve's world (unless I missed that part, somehow). This one flaw also robbed his opening thesis that this story is 'circular' - no beginning - no end. Actually, I am a bit shocked that he did this to his otherwise ""perfect"" novel! No, I am a bit angry/upset - what a shame! Wonder if any of his editors' pointed this out to him ?"
3,Holden Caufield goes back to the future & out of the closet,"With a witty and even profound beginning, and an interesting premise for an alternate history, the story becomes increasingly tenuous and trivial as it accelerates towards its fairy tale ending. Too much social proselytizing can detract from an otherwise good story, and this book is no exception."
3,An Average book,"Face is about a fifteen year old boy who is popular and the head of his group of friends, Mike and Mattew and he has a girlfriend, Natalie. Martin had a great life until he was convinced to get into a stolen car. The car crashed and Martin was taken to the hospital. His life became much different after that night. The rest of the book tells his good and bad experiences and some things that he lost since his face bacame burnt in the crash.What I liked about this book was that Martin was able to find his inner self and he knew he didn't have to have everything to make him happy.What I disliked was how his best friends,girlfriend, and parents acted around him since his face was deformed. It was as though they viewed him as a completely different person, although his face was the only thing that was different."
4,Good crystal case,i bought this case for my mother. This item fits for her cell phone very well. She said she like this case much.
3,decent case,"the case wasnt all that bad as the reviews say, however i do agree that it seems somewhat cheaply made.but it holds the phone tightly and protects, so that means its good i geuss"
5,"Fascinating history, told well","Peter H. Wood describes the experience of Blacks in early South Carolina. In the initial stages of colonization, planters welcomed the skills of Africans, encouraging Black initiative in many projects. Some Africans herded cattle and cultivated rice and indigo, as they had in various parts of Africa. Eventually, however, landowners shifted to intensive plantation development. Planters then sought to limit the strikingly independent economic pursuits of enslaved African-Americans. Wood sets the stage for the outbreak of the Stono Rebellion in 1739; he then chronicles the revolt with a combination of magnificent scholarship and tremendous narrative skill."
3,"A fun read, more of a three and a half, but what do you do?","This book wasn't the most original of ideas, but it did do a good job of exploring the way that psychic powers work and can be used. I thought, the characters were unique, enjoyable, and well rounded. I particularly enjoyed Macy. She is someone that I would like to know. The relationship between Allie and Chuck was creative and entertaining. There were some areas that I thought were glossed over a little too quickly (like Allie's mom), and the book needed an epiloque, at least, but it is definitely worth a read. It is fun and quick."
4,here's a suggestion,a nicely mastered rehash of the re-recordings James did for Capitol in 1955 of his 40's hits. Capitol was kind enough to sneak in a couple tracks from his 1957 comeback band featuring Buddy Rich. Mosaic records has the rest of that band's recordings in a seven-disk set but a single disk from Capitol would be much appreciated. If it's good music why not put it out?
2,Should be called a collection of Paintings...Period!,"The title is misleading. The book contains a collection of paintings...only. The only text in the book is that in the captions for the paintings. The captions contain only such info as the name of the work, the artist, and (sometimes) the medium. Techniques,etc are not discussed. The ""ideas,"" if any, are those which you may get from looking at the pictures.The painting are presented in color and include a wide range of sytles and mediums. If you are looking for a collection of pictures, this is it. If you want more info, keep looking."
5,blade review,I think this blade is fabulous and works so well. Amazon shipped the blade quickly. I have a very old but sturdy Acme juicer that my grandmother gave me years ago but with the new blade it is as good as new. I can juice fruits and vegetables with ease and it's so easy to clean. Just use soap and water.
4,"Refreshing, Entertaining & Enlightening!","I have to agree with others, the author does get sidetracked. But what an easy and enjoyable read! Ravi's theology is fascinating and refined and it all comes out well in this fictional conversation. The ending is not exactly what you would expect either and the author is fearless in diving into some of the most difficult theological paradoxes."
1,Q.Q. is right! Avoid!,"This is indeed an outdated version. I got mine shortly before Leopard was released ( Got my Mac at school time ), the software worked then. Once upgraded, was informed by the program this version will no longer work and I need to BUY the latest version. Not going to happen! I've since learned you can easily switch icons yourself safely, and there are free programs available to change you dock. Check around the net, search You Tube, and avoid this version."
3,Cursory but Useful,Pankhurst writes a nice readable book. The work is a bit shallow on the treatment of a variety of subjects but it is survey so that is expected.It reads well for a reader who is just approaching the subject but anyone with a more than passing interest in the book will likely want something a bit more substantial.
5,great and no regret,"great, u just plug it in and restart ur computer and u will have a great mouse under ur hand that u will never regret buyin it."
2,Looks fancy but doesnt serve the purpose,This is really a very small mouse and after a while just too difficult to use. Planning to send it in for a refund. Its easier to use a regular sized mouse.
1,Crappy Seller,"The item they described was the full quiver, but what I received was just one piece of it. They sent me a replacement piece for the quiver I was supposed to be getting. They got back to me on the phone quickly enough but were not able to resolve the issue."
2,Inadequate oars,"For our 12-ft inflatable boat, these oars are too short and too flimsy. We ended up buying longer, bigger oars with an aluminum shaft."
5,"amazing, does what it says...finally!","this stuff is worth its weight in gold. it WORKS. don't waste your money on pumice stones, pedicures, expensive high end cosmetic creams. this stuff works and you'll notice big results after the first use! you have to use it often to maintain your lovely baby soft feet, but even if you're lazy and just want pretty sandal feet in the summer, you need this!"
3,THIS IS GOOD!,This cd rules and that is all there is to it. THe amazing variety of styles they use make for an ever changing cd that you just can't turn off. I especially recommend the song COme Original
2,"311's ""Soundsystem"" has blown speakers","I became interested in 311 while listening to their Rockline interview one late night during a long-distance drive. I really liked what I heard, particularly ""Stealing Happy Hours"" and ""Beautiful Disaster,"" and I purchased Transistor a few days later. Hearing about a new 311 release, I thought I'd be pretty safe purchasing it without hearing any of it beforehand. After bringing it home and listening to it, if I were to describe the experience in one word, that word would be ""disappointing."" The music doesn't explore any real new territory - the guitar riffs sound like reruns from the last album, and the lyrics sound hastily put together and not particularly in synch with the music. There were just a couple of bright spots, which were the songs ""Life's not a Race"" and ""Strong All Along."""
5,Rock/Rap done the right way,"I like it! I like it! I could kick myself for not buying this album sooner. This sounds at least as good as their blue album. Maybe more meaningful. Strong All Along is my favorite song. They sound legit with the reggae touch. This album deserves much better exposure. Life's Not A Race has a ""havin' a good time"" feel to it. Pretty Mellow. Still, the album rocks hard. 311 DO come original. They ARE original. I am proud to be playing this album with my friends around. All positivity and unity, that's what 311 is all about. This album is good all the way through. It's got heart. Buy this album,please! Also check out 311music.com. They've got some cool t-shirts there. Thank You. P.S.-What explicit lyrics?"
4,I hate short albums but this one should have stopped at track 9,"This record is great.It's in your face, it can make you dance and jump, it can make you feel chill and it can even make your skin tingle...it has it all.However, out of nowhere, unexpectedly the album falls off after track 9 - 'Eons.'311 has never been known for ground-breaking lyrics but what they sing in songs like Evolution and Livin & Rockin is ridiculous and at times make little to no sense.Plus, the addition of a cover song 'Leaving Babylon' is always welcome to stir things up, but this version is slow and draggy and not like the upbeat raggae sounds of 311 I really dig.Overall, Tracks 1-9 are near flawless but the subpar tracks (10-13) leaves the listener not asking for more...but asking for better."
5,311 has got another hit album!,"Soundsystem is their best album next to Grassroots. They have a new CD coming out soon and I can't wait to grab it! The best tracks are; ""Come Original"" ""Freeze Time"" ""Large in the Margin"" ""Livin and rockin"" ""Can't fade me"" and ""Flowing"". Don't hesitate, buy it!"
2,Too much gutter mouth language!,"After hearing about the ex-NPS employee who writes mysteries, I decided to check her books out. Boy, am I glad I only purchased one!My main complaint is Ms. Barr's gutter mouth. Call me old-fashioned, but I do not appreciate it, in either movies or books. Furthermore, for someone who represents our National Parks, especially as a former NPS employee, I believe she should be a little more respectable in her writing.Regarding the rest of her writing, her characters were shallow, although it was evident she was familiar with fire camps. The book didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, and I have no desire to read another of her mysteries."
4,"good mystery, exciting situation","This is an excellent mystery about a groupof firefighters who are stranded on a mountaintopafter discovering a murder. The novel isas much a survival story as a murder mystery,which gives the story an added intensity.The human side of the story is reasonablywell-done, and the murder itself is puzzlingand unusual. Also, it's a locked-room mystery-- in its way."
1,Yogurt Thermometer,"I was disappointed with this item, not because it didn't work but because it is way too short. It was also NOT digital like shown. It is an analog dial. I was thinking I was getting one like on the Make Your Own Yogurt site. This one doesn't even come close to the length of the one he uses and so I end up not clipping it to the side of the pan but hanging my hand in the hot steam, which I had been doing before and thus why I wanted the longer one. It gets HOT hanging your hand over the steam! I am still looking for a much longer one. Gave this one away."
3,Not very accurate,"The little green area on this makes it easy to see that your milk is the right temperature to add your yogurt or starter. But... I have two of these, since I bought two yogurt makers, and they register slightly different temperatures at the same time. So they're not very accurate. I think I'll buy a better thermometer that's cheaper, slide the little hook thingy on the new one, and mark it with a magic marker for ease of use."
4,Entertaining.,"I don't know why certain people here are dissing the effects, because I think they are really good. It's up close and in your face, and I think it looks great. The video that it was shot on looks too clean and pretty, BUT there is a hidden easter egg on the DVD where you can watch the entire movie in ""SNUFF VISION"" which is better if you want a more gritty feel.There isn't really any complicated storyline here, but that's fine. It makes it even more amusing and it will give your friends even more odd and confused looks on their faces."
1,yawn.................,"after the scene where the 1st hand is cut off she'd have been dead in 10 minutes. however...........she's still breathing until the evisceration. don't think so. secondly, why would someone sedate a victim who he's OBVIOUSLY out to torture. for being based on something that really happened, this is weak suace. oh yeah......i've been living in japan for the past year and a half, none of my friends in tokyo have ever heard of these crimes."
4,Guru Guru - '2000 Gurus' (Funfundvierzig),"Twentieth album in over thirty years of existence,'2000 Gurus' prove that Guru Guru still has something to say.Bringing you seven new songs that make good use of special sound effects,loops,samplings and a snake charmer flute.GG founder/mainman Mani Neumeier is reunited with sax/flute player Roland Schaeffer and guitarist Luigi Archetti is on the CD as well.Schaeffer's flute playing is very noticable,specially on ""Tribes And Vibes"",the floating ""Night Birds"" and the impressive ""Das Gluck"" which has a nice ethnic trance feel to it.Neumeier provides some good vocals on ""Marabut"" as ""Blue Space"" is an eight-minute,more jazz oriented track where you hear Schaeffer's soothing sax playing.Nifty looking digipack."
1,Sports Illustrated for kids,"I did not order a renewal of this magazine, and am pretty annoyed with the whole transaction. A year ago I ordered this magazine for my nephew in the state of Virginia, and it came to me instead. I live in Iowa. The little boy never did get his Christmas present. Now I find out I've ""automatically"" renewed it. This is borderline consumer fraud. I do not want the magazine, and don't expect to pay for another year's subscription."
3,At times has good info; but bad sports analysis,"This mag is good for kids 10 and under. It can be funny and in-depth at times, with the SI For Teens sub section inside. Still, the sports analysis is very flawed and biased. Some of them leave me scratching my head. The sports analysis is bad and biased (sports previews), but the mag is good for very casual and not too intelligent sports fans. Sports Illustrated, on the other hand, is excellent and highly recommended."
4,s i kids review,i get si kids every month it is funny intresting and educational. i hope you enjoy every aspect of this magizine
4,Subscription to Sports Illustrated Kids,My son was thrilled with his first magazine and we look forward to next month's delivery.
5,Great magazine for kids,"I've been reading this with my six year old son for several months now. It's a great way to get in some pleasurable reading, and start forming a reading habit, with a child who likes sports.There are a number of standard sections, and nice short articles in kid-friendly language. Each month they have an insert with some playing cards which he looks forward to. And they'll interview a player about a specific skill -- how to steal a base, how to play defense in basketball, etc.I recommend it both for the fun/sports content, and also for the educational benefit of starting the reading habit."
5,"Awesome, well written magazine","I recently boutght this subsctiptoion for my cousin, and he loves i. It provides an in-depth lookat teh wolrd of sports a a readable level for a 10 year old. It has tons of picutes and posters, and provides information on when events will occur. It has some games and some trivia challanges. Good for a pre-teen to teen."
1,Takes too long to get this item,Why does it takes so long to get this item. I could have ordered another 6-month set.... and BTW I have not received it ( was ordered on 9/28 - a month already...Folks - this is not the way to make money...
4,Super magazine for kids,"This magazine is great for kids. It has fun articles with the biggest sports stars, lots of pictures - and even a poster for the kids to tear out."
5,how sweet to have something to remember just how blessed we are to have babies in our life,i was so impressed with the way the book was about Harrison an the wording in it just fit him. he is so precious an will be one year old Feb.2 I'm giving him this book for christmas so when he grow's up he will always remember just how much i love him and am blessed to have him in my life. Thank you for putting this wonderful memory together for Harrison.
5,"Here's a solution to the ""It's MINE"" problem","Our 3-year-old LOVES this show for the stories and the mustic. Our 1-year-old even loves to dance to the songs. And, as a parent, I am so thankful for a pre-school video that I can enjoy watching with my kids -- I hate to admit it, but I actually LOVE the songs! These three episodes that each deal with sharing are some of my personal favorites, and they have helped me intervene when my 3-year-old is being selfish. They really are a great teaching tool as well as good entertainment for the kids. I'd recommend them to any parent of toddlers and preschoolers."
5,GREAAT VIDEO/PRESENT FOR TODDLERS!,Dragontales is a great attention grabber for young toddlers! my little siblings love dragontales and their adventures! they don't miss one episode that airs everyday. dragontales also teaches the toddlers lessons and morals about life so its a very good educational and learning video too. i recommend this to parents who are looking for a good present for their toddlers. this tv series will attract the toddlers attention and keep them wanting more and eventually turn into their favorite show for quite a while! well thats what happened to my sibling! i give it 5 stars because of that!
5,Absolutely stunning,"I've now had this watch for 12 months and it is absolutely gorgeous. As the previous review said, the photo does not show just how beautiful the face is or how stunning it really looks. I am actually a gold person myself and there is just the right balance of gold and s/steel. I love it !!If you are considering this watch then look now further..... you wont be disappointed."
3,Acting at its best,"After watching this movie, I just thought ""what a movie!"".It's tense, it's fast, and it's very well directed. Exciting from start to finish, and a good plot."
4,Serving God and mammon...,"This is a well conceived film with good direction and acting. Its strength is its revelation of Islam's hold upon its members and the lengths a devotee goes, on an everyday basis, to live up to and be guided by a very exacting code. Perhaps all religions exist in order to give meaning to life's questions and strength to man's morals. In the film the differences between living a contemplative and strict life and also having to deal with modern realities presents big emotional problems for an 'average' man. The scenes in the mosques, the streets around Istanbul, the daily rituals between people, etc. make an extremely interesting film. Highly recommended."
2,okay,"There was absolutely no romance. If you are looking for romance this book is not for you. There was hardly any adventure. Anyway, It was okay even though there wasn't really much of a plot."
4,"Helpful, but general","This book is a great starting point for people who want to begin a career in the writing field.Bly lists the various avenues that writers can pursue to earn a living, and gives tips on how to get started in each different category. The book is very general, but Bly also tells the reader how to obtain more information.I would have to agree with the previous review that the book is outdated. I think that a revised edition (something written after the invention of the Internet) would be a very helpful read.If anything, this book is great for generating ideas and heading you off in the right direction."
4,pulio,"polished album, great, happy. yes, it is not classic fito, but it is fito, great fito. i love it, every single song is at least really good, some of them are great, a couple are spectacular."
1,They should be ashamed of themselves,"These two should stay home, get jobs and do something worthwhile. Their proseletizing was actually frightening and if they think they are preaching their religion to people who want to hear it, I think they are delusional. If their religeous zeal made it OK for them ethically to go there under false pretenses, then spare me their ideology. The Afghani people who became involved with them risked there lives for a little food - these young women certainly never learned how to write a book or tell an interesting story. Not worth the paper it is printed on."
1,Criminals legally making money in America,"I was appalled to read that these two ""Prisoners of Hope"" were actually missionaries in Afghanistan under the disguise of aid workers. They lied about who they were and what they were doing, not something that you would expect from ""god fearin' folks"". Their actions jeopardized actual aid work, and their presence in Afghanistan did more harm then good, and what is even more appalling is that they are making money of their crimes. If you are really bored and what to see how xtians break the law in gods name then read this book, if not, just use it for an extra leg on that old chair."
3,Okay.,"This was an interesting story about two Christian, foreign aid workers in Kabul, Afghanistan. I appreciated the background on what got them to Kabul and also the descriptions of their trials and frustrations while in captivity. Too often I've read bios or diarires that depict everything as ""pie in the sky"". Few people live that kind of life, so I appreciate it when people can be true, even if it means not being portrayed in a positive light. My biggest complaint about the book is its stilted language. For example, the use of ""I was not"" instead of ""I wasn't"" or ""I did not"" instead of ""I didn't"". This book was written in a conversational tone, though every time a contraction wasn't used when it should have been, it jumped off the page at me. It was distracting. Also, it would have been nice to have gotten more about their interactions with their fellow captives. This isn't a page turner. But it is an interesting story of faith put to the test and lived out in extreme circumstances."
2,Does it come in different versions?,"I ordered this accompaniment with the 6th Ed Kontakte textbook, and my workbook differed from the majority of the students in the class. I don't believe that multiple versions of the same edition were advertised, but it appears that multiple editions do exist; they are very similar, but several of the activities for each chapter are slightly different. For most classes, it's probably not a big deal, but be sure to check with your professor before ordering this book online as opposed to your campus bookstore."
4,Makes lightweight hiking (and reading the book) a breeze,"This is a fun to read book with nice illustrations. It's short- only took me a couple hours to read- but it's entertaining and illuminating. I haven't gone full ultralight yet, but this book did help me eliminate a good 10lbs from my pack weight.I have since read other books that helped me reduce pack weight even more, but I don't think they would have been as effective if I hadn't had this book as an introduction first."
3,There's not a lot to this book,"It looks like a couple of magazine articles (either National Geographic Adventure or Backpacking) tacked together. Much of the advice is obvious. On the other hand, it's not a bad book exactly, just woefully incomplete."
1,Crappy rusty little things,"Any small amount of moisture makes these little guys rust. They came with stickers on the bottom that didn't come off, so I tried a few methods of removal and any of the cutters that touched water ended up super rusty."
2,like sandra brown,I put in a review for this book last week and its not here. I think I gave it 2 stars. I remeber i was thinking between one and two. If this is an example of LH contempory romance she needs to stick to her historicals. This is story of woman who is still mourning the loss of her husband and has a one night stand(which turns into more). She gets pregnant and they get married. He has secrets that he can't tell her for good reason. She gets mad. I found heroine to be stupid. To me this book read like a Sandra Brown romance. I am not a fan of SB. There is just something about them i don't like. We are being told the heroine is wonderful but if find her self-righteous
3,games boring yuppies play,"Indifferently produced yuppie porn. But at least the actors are all (with the exception of Carol Queen) young and appealing.Each segment is introduced by a lady who explains in great detail how deep and cool the following story is, which is mildly insulting to the viewer. This narrator has a stiff and wooden public speaking manner. I think she might be the editrix of ""Libido"" magazine, who are the people that produced this video.This tape was worth renting for $5 because of the first segment which involved a naked man being ""forced"" to masturbate in front of a crowd of women. This was ""hot"" for me. The crowd of women spectators was interesting, too. It included a number of celebrities from the Good Vibrations, kinky-sex-is-cool crowd. Betty Dodson, the ladies-masturbation guru, is present, wearing purple hair. And Kim Airs, Brookline's favorite daughter, puts in an excellent star turn disguised in male drag as a leering, podgy, dirty old man."
5,discontinued series,This used to be available on re-runs but no longer. If you like it this is the thing to buy.
3,"ah, special features","Wanted to comment about the special features, as they aren't described by any reviewers here. They are pretty cool.There are three interviews in this set: Butch Patrick, Charles Nelson Reilly and the Genie (her name escapes me now). Charles is still quite funny with his self-depricating view of his role in this series. All interviews are on the third disk.Sid and Marty Krofft also do some commentaries on the pilot episode and others, while Butch Patrick and Reilly do as well. They provide some interesting tidbits about the show and it's impact."
4,Great Memories!,"Out of all the Saturday morning shows I watched growing up, Lidsville was one of my favorites. After the show's short run in the early 70's I never heard much about it after that. I always remembered it though. I was shopping the other day and saw the DVD set for Lidsville and immediately bought it. The show brought back great memories and it is still pretty cool even now. I love it when HooDoo throws his top hat up in the air and it turns into his flying hat. Sid & Marty Krofft had the best shows, and I am glad they are being released on dvd so kids today can experience them. HR Puffnstuff, Land of the Lost, and of course Lidsville were such a part of my childhood. Glad these shows haven't been forgotten. Now how is that for a topper???"
1,very unpleasant reading,"Maybe it's supposed to be a parody - I can't imagine that there are any even vaguely-functioning adults whose erotic worlds consists of such things or find them acceptable. I used to like these books, so here's hoping to a better book next time!"
1,Sorry Bishop Jakes!,"Cover Girls has to be one of the worst Christian books I have ever read. I do believe that if Bishop Jakes' ministry was not so well-known that this book would never have been published.The characters are one dimensional and poorly developed. This made it difficult to relate to or empathize with the main characters. It was hard to find the characters' true voices. They all sounded as if Bishop Jakes was mimicing women's conversations he'd overheard. The plot was unbelievable and lacked cohesion. Plus, the plot was just so-o-o predictable."
1,The Truth shall Set you FREE,"FREE! This book should have been given away for FREE! I MUST tell the TRUTH on this Book. It was very boring with lifeless characters. Regardless of the truth, T.D. Jakes won't feel the brunt of these reviews because brotha-man is SO PAID!"
2,An unfortunate disappointment...,"T.D. Jakes first foray into Christian fiction was an extreme disappointment for me. I picked up this book with great anticipation based on my love for Jakes' ability to make a story come alive when he is teaching from the pulpit and in his inspirational writings. Unfortunately that ability did not transfer to the art of fiction novel writing.In this tale, we meet a host of women who are connected primarily by friendship or work. The story attempts to follow the changes in these women's lives as they encounter trials and tribulations. I did not find the characters or the storylines to be well developed. Often when attempting to infuse faith into the characters lives, it felt that sections of sermons had been lifted and abruptly plunked down into the middle of the story.It is my conclusion that Jakes gift for teaching is best left to face-to-face ministry and the writing of inspirational non-fiction."
4,Glad I discovered Milo Jacovich -....,"This is a good crime novel set in Cleveland, OH - probably late '90's. Have several Cleveland co-workers here that say Roberts knows his town. In fact am handing off a copy to a friend from there who is of Slovenian/German Ohio ancestry. Normally I am a Paretsky/Chicago crime authors buff.Milio is Slovenian/American - the characters in the book are Serbian/American so it references the news of today on some of the background material with a part of the plot tied to WWII actions in the then Yugoslavia.It moves well, Milo Jacovich is not a superhero of a detective but has all the buddies and side characters that any good mystery should have - to help flesh out the plot. Cleveland sounds like New York City on a smaller scale but with similar ethnic turf in the neighborhoods woven into the plot.I read it in 1 night - albeit a long one - but it kept my interest up and I will buy more ""Milo"" books. This would adapt well to a TV movie, too, I think.Buy it!"
4,Great and Durable,"This lego was great and was the second episode 3 lego I got. I think that lego could have made this item a little bit better but overall, it was pretty cool. If lego had only put a little more on it, it would be the perfect lego. Still, it is a great lego and is defenitally worth the money."
5,AWESOME TOY!!!,I jsut got this toy today and it is awesome!!! People lie they say it falls apart easly that is total poppycock. it is very durable and i will have much fun playing with this and all my other star wars lego sets that i have now and that i will get in the future.
4,Giggle Generator,"As I sat down with my 6 year old to read this, I expected a pleasant experience. However, the book turned our afternoon into a giggle fest. Very, very funny! Cleaver read that my son and I have returned to several times since it was released in August. My full review is on my blog site (August 2, 2010) at [...]"
2,Ok,"I was not impressed that there was more pics than words and that made me very sad, that I spend me m money on that"
2,Worst Mary-Kate and Ashley Movie YET!!!!,"well, im uasully critical of the olsen twins.But when there series came out(so little time) i thought winning london might be okay.BOy was i wrong!The acting is horrid,and the whole plot is stupid!If u dont enjoy girls running around london shopping and listening to tycno music in the backround this movie isnt for u.The characters Riley and Chloe Lawerence(Ashley and M-K)have the same names from the tv series!cant these girls think of something original?This movie isnt for kids under 10 eigther cause there was way too much kissing action in this movie(in an air vent and on a ship)I was really suprised that so many people gave it 4 or 5 stars!cant you guys see bad talent in this movie?theres so many better Mary-Kate and ashley movies-such as-passport to paris,billbourd dad,our lips are sealed,toul+trouble,or to grandmothers house we come-i havnt thought of this befor but those movies are 5 stars to winning londons 2 stars."
4,"parents pleasable, kid great","the boys are cute and it shows alot of London, so info and yet kid friendly. the kissing could get intense"
2,"OK, but grossly innacurate","As sugary Mary Kate and Ashley movies go, this was OK, but I thought the ending was too predictable, and the portrayal of London and the English was so bad it was hysterical. The actor, Jesse Spencer, who played Riley(Mary Kate)'s boyfriend was so obviously NOT English, that it was no surprise to discover he was Australian. Nobody in England speaks like that, and most English kids don't have fancy luncheons and play polo on the weekends! It was gnerally poorly done, but then again, most American movies about London are. I just think that if the plot was spruced up a bit and the footage of London (and the accents) were made A LOT better, it would be a great film....."
3,It was alright But the story line was a bit far fetched,Winning London is an alright movieThe twins were great in it expecially ashley who played Riley.Mary-kate was well she acted a bit old and waaaaaaaay tooo serious for her age.Ashley was just normal like a 15 year old girl would be you know. The storyline was a bit far fetched didn't like it that much. Oh and Mary-kate's boyfriend was a bit stuck up so i can only give this 3 stars.
2,Not the best,"This book is ok, but is by far not the best text available. This text was used by our medical school for gross anatomy and many times lacked the detailed information required by medical students. I broke down a couple of weeks into the course and bought a much more effective book.The Snell book lacks detailed diagrams and so-called clinical correlations. A large portion of diagnosing problems involving the musculoskeletal system is being able to invision the mechanism of injury. Snell does not have any detailed case or example information that reinforces the concepts. This book will be fine if you have a great anatomy instructor to fill in the blanks; however, is a poor reference if you are left to fill in the blanks.Bottom line: I paid for this book, used it twice and it has been sitting on my bookshelf throughout the remainder of my gross anatomy course."
1,This is the wrong battery for the Panasonic Lumix FZ18,Amazon is bundling the wrong battery with the Panasonic Lumix FZ18.The correct battery is the CGA-S006
1,Doesn't Fit the battery holder.,I received the battery fast. However it doesn't fit the space of the battery holder with my Lumix camera. I am going to return it.
5,Lumix FZ8K battery,Last just as long as the original battery. I can shoot all day (w flash) and have plenty left over.
5,Use every day,"I bought this knowing I would need a back up battery constantly. It performs just like the original Panasonic battery, so I'm never without the ability to shoot all day."
1,Didn't last,"Battery never would hold a charge very long and I only used it as my backup, maybe I got a dud."
1,For Christians only!,"I want to agree with the one other reviewer who was misled by the title. I bought the book thinking it would be a well rounded factual book as the title and cover bullets described. The constant (as in practically every paragraph) references to Jesus, Christianity, and Christian values made it impossible for me to get the information I was looking for. The last straw was this statement from the book: ""I don't know about you, but something in my heart of hearts tells me it is more than coincidental that the homeschool movement has been birthed in a generation run amuck with legalized abortion. As in the time of Moses and in the time of Christ as well, the wholesale slaughter of innocence has provoked a mighty response from God."" P-LEASE! Anyway, if this statement doesn't bother you then by all means buy the book. As for me, I'm returning it right away!"
4,Sinbad,I wanted this for my library; used to watch it when I was a kid. Special effects were pretty good for their day.
5,Nicest exhaust you can get for a 325,I've had one of these on my 325i for over 5 years. It is the best exhaust money can buy. It has a unique low sound. I wanted an exhaust that would sound good not like some loud ricer.The borla exhaust has the perfect sound. It's very low pitched and not super loud but trust me people can you hear you comming. It's just perfect. Not to mention it looks Very nice.Get this exhaust and you'll be a borla customer for life like i've become.
4,not an expert but I like listening to these; and the price is right,"I keep the box of CDs in my car, and pick one at random to listen to when traveling. So far I have been pleased with the quality of the performances. For the price ($.65 per CD?), I think they are hard to beat. After listening to this set, I bought the similar set of Bach works, but I haven't started listening to that yet."
3,D-12,"Why hasn't anyone reviewed this yet? Dirty Dozen flow like masters, Swifty, Kon Artist, The Kuniva, Bizzare, they all chip in on some fly beats on Eminem's new albulm why nobody wanna review this apart from me?"
5,Any college-level holding strong in not only history and culture but fashion will find this appealing to many different genres,"Hair has displayed more than changing styles: it's served as an indicator of class, gender, conformity and power throughout history - and ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HAIR: A CULTURAL HISTORY follows the changing issues surrounding hair and styles. World history and all cultures are taken into account throughout, with chapters opening with an essay on the overall topic, followed by alphabetically arranged entries along with black and white photos and bibliographic references. Any college-level holding strong in not only history and culture but fashion will find this appealing to many different genres.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"
2,Humanitarian? maybe.. Interesting? yes.. Worth it? no..,"OK.. First of all I agree that the IRA is corupt, and what Martin did , was FAIRLY justified. Listing The IRA as a terrible evil thing , as he has proclaimed it to be in this book, isn't justified however, People in it should Learn a bit of compassion, but the ultimat Cause is Just.Now.. Over all, this book is catches the Interest of people, especially Brits. And I geuss Could even be called Well written.. But Mainly what this Book is, Is Anti-IRA propaganda."
3,Dead Men writing?,"Just to add another twist to the tale... On Thursday 17th June 1999 Martin McGartland was shot 5 times in the legs and stomach at the secret address in Tyneside where he'd gone to escape from IRA death threats. He survived by grabbing the assassin's gun, causing him to flee the scene before a fatal shot was fired. The bullets removed from his body where traced back to Northern and Ireland and McGarland is quoted as believing he has once again escaped an IRA-death squad. Eamon Collins, author of another IRA expose-book ""Killing Rage"" was found bludgeoned to death on a country road back in January. His face had been gouged out with knives. Collins too had been warned his life was under threat from the IRA.The thought that speaking out against terrorism and writing this sort of book can carry a death sentence is quite a sobering one."
5,Ann J,This book Fifty dead men walking was an excellent story about the IRA and MI5 recruitment of inersant young men in Ireland and the ordeals that they endure through there time with them.
4,Age appropriate wild animals,Fantastic video without any 'too real' wild animal moments. The excitement of the chase cuts to something else interesting at just the right time so no fast forwarding needed. A little long but well there are times when that's a good thing. The kids (3.5 and 18mo.) really like it.
2,Not what I expected...,"I was totally disappointed with this product...I purchased this for my high school aged son and I when I started going through it myself, I actually felt like a dupe for buying it in the first place. First off, this program it not tutorial by any means and it assumes a fair amount of chemistry background. The haphazard presentation of subject matter is more like a trivia game then a serious approach to learning chemistry. I'm not letting my son touch this software - my opinion only - but I could easily imagine a beginner picking this software up and becoming so intimidated by chemistry as to develop a mental block about it."
1,Where are the pictures,Ok I am returning to college to get my Masters degree. I bought this to brush up before enrolling in Chem. I am very disappointed. This is more like a review for someone preparing to take a final exam. The interactive portion is just part of the test taking part. There are not even chapters or presentations at all just questions with answers available.
5,ChemTutor Excalibur: What Would I Do Without It?,"I am currently a senior in high school, and with the pressures of applying to college and my heavy course load it's hard to find the sufficient time needed to study for chemistry. Furthermore, I am not an excellent science scholar, but with ChemTutor's methods of explaining, my comprehension of chemistry has greatly improved. With ChemTutor Excalibur I have begun to not only understand the material better, but more importantly I maximize my efficiency of studying for chemistry. ChemTutor is easily comprehendible and straightforward so that I can get the most out of my time studying. With ChemTutor all my questions and confusions about chemistry are answered, and because of the ChemTutor teaching and testing method I am always prepared for my next chemistry test. I would recommend ChemTutor for anyone; it is an excellent tool for the study and practice of chemistry."
3,September Sessions,"Another good jack johnson surf video but this time with pro surfers kelly and rob at least. Smaller waves than Thicker Than Water, but more remote locations. It has more of a vacation feel to it. Same good music. I would recommend his first video over this one, unless you are into the filming 16 Mil thing."
3,Average surf movie,"I'll start by saying that if you like a laid back-style surf movie, you'll probably enjoy this. I just felt like the filming wasn't very dynamic. It shows the same sort of shots over and over again and it didn't really give a sense of ""being there."" It's a good movie, but I think others like Odyssey, Step into Liquid and Black and White are better."
3,Dogs are truly man's best friends.,"Enjoyed the book, however it was not as good as ""A Year On Ladybug Farm""."
1,Worthless,"- You can't print unless all ink cartridges are installed and have some ink. For example, if you want to print a black/white document, your color cartridges must be installed with at least minimum ink.- The printer uses a lot of ink- I never used the color ink but somehow it is slowly going away- Paper jams are a hassle- It is completely worthless. Please, spend a little extra and get a different brand."
1,Terrible machine,"The only thing it does reliably is use up ink -- very expensive ink. Even when I'm not doing any printing, the machine goes through ""self-cleaning"" routines in order to use up more ink. What with the inflated price of cartridges, I calculate I'm spending about $2.75 per copy."
1,buyer beware,"this printer crashed under warranty twice, it was a huge hassle to get brother to do anything about it. warranty is over, printer crashed again. i may have print 100/200 sheets of paper on this machine in its career with me. it seems like a deal for the price but it's actually cheaper to print at kinkos if you divide the purchase price buy the sheet."
5,Great small machine!,"You certainly get your money's worth on this one! Small size and big capabilities. Faxes nicely, copies, prints, scans. What more can you ask for? The print is nice, the color copies are great and it fits almost anywhere. Highly recommend!"
1,Programmed to Lie,"It's a well known fact that printer companies make the majority of their money on consumables. Well, this product has been designed with an intentional flaw that causes the printer to stop printing when the printer detects low ink. The problem is that when this detection occurs, there is still 50% of the ink remaining in the cartridge. It's extremely frustrating. I would not recommend this product to anybody."
2,"great concept, needs work","After seeing the advertisement for this product I thought it sounded like the perfect solution for our little newborn who drinks way too fast from the playtex nursers. Turns out after spending almost thirty dollars to get these home, she can't use them. They were too hard for her to nurse from. After a very frustrating 10 minutes, she was only able to get one ounce of milk and sucked in a lot of air from all the fussing that happened during those ten minutes. That didn't help her spitting up problem. I read other reviews from other websites and found that many mothers of newborns said these bottles were just too hard for new babies. Maybe later they will be useful, but for now they are just collecting dust in my cabnit. On the plus side, they are compatible with the avent nipples, so maybe we will at least get to use the bottle portion of this set."
1,buyers beware,"The wall street journal is a good newspaper, and I have enjoyed it the few times I have read it. Unfortunately in this case I was unable to read it as the paper was never delivered! So if you are into waiting for months for it before asking for a refund then by all means purchase this.Again I want to emphasize the paper itself IF it gets to you is a good paper."
1,Not quite a disaster,"Addendum: I cancelled the paper only order via Kindle and the reps were quite polite. I never did figure out the online app - because I couldn't get into the stories, just the summaries. I then went on line at the WSJ, ordered the digital and paper versions of the paper - and had immediate access to the paper on line and the first copy of the paper appeared withing four days. At a cost nearly $200 per year less than the WSJ version. The app isn't quite a disaster (I never could make the print readable) but it clearly needs some work. BTW, even though I have trouble with the small print, I've been reading a hard copy too long to switch to digital completely. And besides, the print version includes the silly monthly WSJ magazine - which gives a glimpse of a fantasy land that those of us in the midwest living on fixed incomes can't quite imagine without some visual help"
5,Breathtaking!,"I am relatively new to jazz, but this CD has made me fall in love with it and with Lee Morgan. His tone and overall sound shout confidence and tell you exactly what he was feeling. The music takes you over with the great tunes and powerful tone. I definitely reccommend this CD as well as all of his others, but mostly his Greatest Hits CD which is just fantastic...and is self-explanatory--all of the best of Lee Morgan. It's a MUST HAVE!!"
1,Bad description on item,"The description on the item is not accurate - there is nothing in the bottom and the cover simply hangs down, proving less covering or protection than a simple plastic tarp.Plus, there is an essentially open side, although held together with hook-n-loop, there is a gap of about four inches on the front corners, which you can't close tighter.Very disappointed - 1 star is too high for what you think you are getting. This is the very first thing I've returned to Amazon in a very long time of shopping with them."
4,Light duty but effective,"Not a cover for the outdoors, pretty light weight, butserves my purpose of shielding from dust in the garage.Fits my Coleman 5000W, but does have openings for2 handle to extend out which really does me no goodsince I have 1 single handle in the middle."
4,Me 262 - Germany's first operational jet,"This is another of the well done Crowood Aviation Series books. This is a very good, detailed book about the development of Germany's first operataional jet, the Me-262. It reviews the history of the jet, the problems of the new jet technology and the rush to get this fast plane into the skies to knock down the Allied bombers.Lots of clear B&W; photos, technical data, line drawings help flesh out the narrative. I especially like the section on the replication of six Me -262's to fly at air shows. The author also addresses post war influence on Soviet and US designs.What's missing? Color photos or plates to show the camouflage schemes used. Willy Radinger (published by Schiffer) has a book out on the Me-262 with a little less text, but many excellent photos from WW2 jets as well as a restored 262.If yo're not a modeler, than this book is probaly the better buy. I solved the problem of deciding by buying both."
1,three hour bore,"anatomy of a murder wallows in boredum and repetition for nearly three hours. This is a good movie if you want to fall asleep to. Some frank references to certain acts do little to enliven this waste of time. Watch North by northwest, Ben hur Odds against tommorow or tarzan's greatest adventure if you seek truly memorable movies released during 1959"
1,worst courtroom drama I have ever seen,"Anatomy of a Murder is the worst court room drama I have seen. jimmy Stewart must be spinning in his grave whenever someone watches it. An amature movie when compared to any other court room centered drama, ..."
2,Production Box - not Rabbit Box,"The ""Balloon to Rabbit Box"" I received is very well made, very nice looking and works perfectly. But it should be called a ""Production Box"" and not a ""Rabbit Box"" because the chamber is far too small for any rabbit I have or have ever used. It could hold an average sized guinea pig, or a baby rabbit, but I have a very small, Holland Lop (one of the smallest bunny breeds) and there is no way that he can fit into that box!"
2,"Remember, this is FICTION","Genre: Christian Sci-Fi. Is there such a genre? The author seems to have taken some creative liberties in her interpretation of Scripture, so the reader really needs to remember that this is purely fiction and not a mainstream end-times interpretation. Those not too sure about end-times prophecies, please get some books on the subject that are honest interpretations rather than fiction.Otherwise, some of the characters and scenarios are rather unrealistic and or simplistic (Mossad members being anything but professional in a crisis?). The final book in the trilogy is mildly entertaining, and ends without real ""solution"" - my guess is the author couldn't see the ending for her inventions along the way. I gave it two stars for power of imagination, not style, not storyline."
5,A great trilogy,"Once again Marzulli has provided us with a fast paced thriller complete with new characters. Fitzpatrick is a welcome addition to the Nephilim universe. His encounter with Sene will chill you to the bone.This one has it all. Action, political intrigue, religious themes, and inspirational overtones."
4,Very enjoyable book,"This book is as the title suggests, very enjoyable. It gives a different light to UFO's and alien sightings. I would recommend this book. I am planning on buying hte other 2 books in the series."
5,The perfect gift for any cat lover!,"Short meditations, each one based on and illustrated by a true cat story. The author truly understands and loves cats (many of the stories are about her own pets). If you know a cat lover, this is the perfect gift book!"
1,"I ordered new, but didn't get it.","What My Cat Has Taught Me About LifeI'm going to send back this product because I received it with marked up pages. I hope that you'll send me a new copy. For the moment, since this book awaits return to Amazon (because of the post-holiday rush), I can't yet comment on the content. Please come back to me after I receive a new copy. Thanks."
3,Castaways Of The Flying Dutchman,"It was all right. I read it because someone in my family received it as a gift and didn't want it (guess whose bookshelf it ended up on). I was mildly interested in it and decided to give it a go. I found the first half of it pretty cool. But in the second half, I found the plot very weak. I was disappointed that the second half has almost nothing to do with the Flying Dutchman. Overall, it wasn't very interesting, but I wouldn't exactly call it a waste of time."
4,Too many riddles...,"I have been reading Jacque's ""redwall"" books for almost a year, and I have been loving them. I eventually got tired of them, so I tried reading these series. The opening is exciting, with many scary and thrilling parts. Then the ending is boring, and there in no climax. On a scale of 1-10 compared to redwall books, I'd say 5."
2,Best for only those who enjoy short story anthologies,"After a few chapters, it became a chore to finish this book. I prefer hard sci fi novels, and I only found about a third of these short stories to be interesting. Many of the stories had too much fantasy for my tastes. Of the few stories that I did enjoy such as those by Baxter and McAuley, they really were too short on details and elaboration, but I did get a taste of the authors' styles and I think it is worthwhile to see what other novels they may have written."
5,Amazing Grace by Kathleen Norris,I ordered four books for a small group study I participate in. The advantage of free shipping and fast service was a great incentive. I have always been pleased with my Amazon purchases.
5,Kathleen Norris is that very wise sister we all wish we had.,Kathleen Norris is one of the great intellectuals of our time. She possesses keen insight and remarkable compassion. She gently leads her readers through the traumas of life and religion into a gentle and peaceful reconciliation with God. I love this woman.
5,A true Gem,"For any of you who have been on the road more that a short trip, this is the nostalgic book for you. I found myself hoping there were 500 more pages. The basic premise of the book entered my mind often while on the road myself. Brad Newsham does an excellent job in tackling the question of ethics in introducing a ""random soul"" to our western world...is this good for whom? Excellent book...enjoy"
3,Good story,It was a good story. Stephen King always is. I like how the story began and it w definitely a spooky premise. I wasn't too impressed with the ending. A good quick read
2,"Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.......","It is true, this was is a dud. I hate to say it, but the guy or gal who spends their hard-earned bucks on literature deserves to know the truth. This story would have been great if it had been written by a high school junior for his/her Creative Writing class. Coming from a man with King's abilities it is inexcusably bad. It reads like a true account from some cheesy ""Real Life Psychics"" magazine. I could do better. My cat could do better. So could Stephen King. Why he chose not to is a mystery to me. Save your bucks, people, let this one ride the bullet into oblivion."
3,Good for an occasional spin,"If you are new to Critters Buggin, I would go with Guest or Host. Those disks fully rock! Amoeba is more like what you put in when you want to hear what heroin sounds like (or something). I spin this disk only every now and then when in ultra mellow slightly darkened mood. But for what it is, its great."
1,Text to Speech Disabled By Publisher!,"It's a shame that the publisher has denied its customers the right to use their Kindle to aid in reading this book. I hope that through outstanding lawsuits, this blatant from of discrimination will soon be history. Buy this book, but not the Kindle version."
4,Manhunting in Mississippi (Temptation),A light hearted tale that makes for good easy holiday reading. I enjoy Stephanie Bond's books for that reason although after reading a few they become a bit predictable.
3,That Kind Can Never Change! Can They?,"The book was in excellent condition. The subject matter was interesting but disturbing for me in our present situation. Actually it ended well but was depressing because of the length of time involved in the resolution of the author's ""problem""."
2,Misleading title,"This book is mostly how-to reverse engineer, and precious little about how to safeguard against it. Sure you could work out your own techniques to frustrate the reversing used in this book, but the author provides few suggestions of his own.The book is therefore misleadingly titled. If you want a book to reverse engineer, this is it. If you want a book for how to safeguard against it, look elsewhere."
2,Disappointing,"I was really excited about reading this book when I first bought it and really disappointed when I finished. As mentioned by an earlier reviewer, the biographical information is very interesting, but the physics stinks. I found the technical explanations incomplete and difficult to follow.In addition, the book was written as if the author was in a hurry to meet a deadline. There was a lot of repetition, several editing errors, and the illustrations seemed to be thrown in just to take up space.For a much better explanation of this mind-blowing topic, I recommend John Gribbin's ""Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality."" Gribbin does his usual excellent job of explaining thing simply enough so you understand what he's saying without needing a Ph.D. in physics. The final chapter of this book wraps everything up with Gribbin's preferred explanation of entanglement and quantum reality. After you read it, you'll be saying to yourself, ""Hey, cool!"""
1,An Absurdity,"How can you be selling this book on Kindle, when you don't even have any of Grisham's available ??? Am looking for his newest book, esp., but absolutely none of his books are there for download.Seems to me you are putting the expensive cart before the horse.... Why would you have a critique on the novels that are not in your download system??Am really disappointed,Claire G."
4,A really enjoyable Barney video,"This is one Barney video I can sit down and watch with my toddler (2.5 years). When she first got it (around 20 months) she was just getting really interested in numbers and letters so this one really interested her. The bright colourful schoolhouse really got her attention and she constantly points out toys and games that they play at Baby Bop's school. She enjoys the songs, especially the one where she can march around the loungeroom. The songs are catchy and the dancmoves are simple for her to follow. An enjoyable video."
3,O.K. - I've seen better Barney,My son loves Barney - we have several other Barney Video's and this is his least favorite. It just doesn't have the typical Barney catchy tunes and story lines. I don't think this is one of the better Barney tapes.
5,Very Entertaining!,"My 22 month-old stops dead in his tracks when Barney is on at home and simply loves this video. It's great to watch him march in place with the video.I also thought it was much more tolerable than the t.v. show. Good one to buy, I would strongly recommend it."
2,Spaced Out in Grand Canyon,"Not what I expected. The guy got 3 airdrops, pre-positioned food and water along the route, and described wanting the experience to be a ""picnic"".Also, he is pretty repetitive and the feel of his writing is ""spacey"".There are a few good sections, but overall I don't recommend - try ""Death in the Grand Canyon"" or ""Grand Obsession"" instead."
5,The Man Who Walked Through Time,Excellent read for someone who has hiked rim-to-rim-to-rim in the Grand Canyon in 2011. This is a book to pass on to the next generation of hikers.
5,Great accent and easy to keep clean!!,"My husband and I are beach lovers.We recently came back from a trip to Hatteras Island with several small pieces for our beach and tropical fish themed master bath. This rug was a perfect addition and it is also sturdy and easy to sweep, shake, or wipe clean. I also received it righ on time and the price was right."
5,Wonderful!,I started using this diaper cover when my son was about 18 months old and now I wish I had used them all along. They absolutely never leak and the gusseted legs don't wick the moisture onto the child's clothes like alot of the other covers out there. They work just as well during the day as they do at night. The fact that you don't have to wash these very often is a big bonus. I definitely recommend these covers.
2,"Get to work, Gamson!","What a bitter disappointment! Many of the previous reviews of the European release of this disk stressed Green's songwriting and sugary vocals, but what made SP for me was the incredibly syncopated, interweaving, and just plain PERCOLATING synth and bass lines. That's not here on this disk, anywhere! I see that David Gamson is listed as a producer, but not a musician save for an occasional bass line. While this disk has other strengths, the profusion of beat loops, strummed guitars, and blah pads make this disk sound like everyone else. Finally, Green's voice just is not a good mix with in-yo-face rap; what's next, an Art Garfunkle/Limp Bizkit collaboration?"
5,Wayyyy better than Old Spice . . . Strippers Love It Too!!!,I'm so totally serious it makes the ladies at the Mons Venus niteclub in Tampa red hot !!!I'l never wear anything else !!!
2,Not for big leakers,"I like that this is reusable, comfortable, affordable, and doesn't show through clothing. HOWEVER it shifts and (more importantly) it doesn't take much to soak through these. They need to be water proof on one side or something! but they're not. Hope to find something better, went back to disposable."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"Despite the raving reviews regarding this tape, I found it not to be as good as all the hype. I was expecting a longer session. It was just too short. Mr. Velez is a great speaker, who only gave small snippet of information regarding his methods. I was under the impression that this tape was a full seminar. No such luck. It was like a tease to get someone to buy his full, workshop for thousands of dollars. For the most part, it was extremely basic, covering investing material (What is a trend? And ,What are candle stick charts?) which is readily available at most FREE financial sites. Half the time the charts weren't shown as he discussed them. I did however, come away with a miniscule piece of the ""swing trading pie"" (a $50 piece), which may, or may not be helpful in future trades. In fact, with incomplete information, my trading may be at more risk. Hey, you get what you pay for. Buyer beware!"
3,I'd recommend others over this one,"My 19 month old son seems to like this tape the least of the 10 other Barney tapes I've purchased. There's a part where a kitten gets stuck in a tree and a tin man attempts to get the cat out of the tree-- This seems to scare my son. His favorite Barney Tapes are ""sing and dance with Barney"", ""Let's Play School"", ""Barney Songs"", ""Barney's Big Surprise"", and ""Live in NYC"" and ""Waiting for Santa"". I'd definitely recommend purchasing these first-- I feel they are more worth the money. ""adventure Bus"", ""Imagination Island"" ""Kids for Character"" are his least favorites. And ""Alphabet Zoo"" is my specially least favorite."
1,Not LRB without Birtles Shorrock Goble,"I have to disagree with the other reviews. This Live recording stinks imo and is nothing but a cover band of imposters pretending they are the Little River Band. No Beeb Birtles, Glenn Shorrock, or Graham Goble = NO Little River Band! Just listen to the sample song of ""Reminising"". It stinks because it's not Gleen Shorrock singing. There isn't a single original member of LRB in this Live recording I don't think.If your seeking the REAL LRB then buy the best Live recording ever from the ORIGINAL LRB BAND (featuring Birtles Shorrock & Goble) title ""Backsatge Pass"". This fake imposter cover band touring today imo stole the copyrights to the band name and are frauds. IMO."
4,Boy are my muscles sore! but in a good way!,"I have seen other ""yoga"" videos and have either been so confused or i hurt myself. This video has non annoying people in it, which is really good and they show you how to do things with a modified version. They actually explain! I know I couldn't believe it myself! I would recommend this video to a begginner or an intermediate, but not to a pro, I mean if your a pro allready why are you watching these tapes? Shouldn't you know enough allready? Well anyways the first day I did the work out I had to take the next day off from excersise because my muscles were sore!"
4,Great for strength!,"I just got this video and I must say it is quite challenging. I could feel the muscles in my legs and abs work very hard while going through the poses. Especially the chair pose. The only thing I didn't like was they do the triangle pose to one side, but not the other. I'm the type of person who needs to do the poses to both sides of the body. It really wasn't a big deal I just went ahead and did it to the other side. All in all a challenging video that will create heat and strength in your body top to bottom!"
5,Nintendo DS Lite 17 in 1 Bundle Pak White,My 10-yr-old son loved receiving this product. It contains many helpful accessories to improve his Nintendo DS Lite experience.
2,Oxo Good Grips Tea Kettle,"the tea kettle has a nice shape and the whistle works fine, but the inside of the spout began to rust within the first month."
1,"Oh Happy Day is ""Oh Rip-Off Day""","The Blu-Ray is absolutely terrible! If it wasn't for the fact that the cost was so minimal, I would surely have returned it. Let's see, where do I begin? There are a couple actual vidoes of choirs and singers performing but the quality of the picture is grainy, the performances amateurish, and simply lacking. After that, the rest of the blu-ray consist of ""elevator"" type spiritual music with lots of religous scenes similar to Catholic churches, statues and symbols. I was extremely disappointed and felt ripped off. Please do not waste your time and money. It's not worth the material it was reproduced on."
3,Puzzled,"I thought I was ordering a package of 3 canvases, somehow I wound up with one.I wouldn't have [paid that much shipping for just one."
4,"Great Machine, I have had 2 of them for almost 3 years!",These have been great machines for me. We have one for the master and one for the babies room. It is a bit louder than I would like it to be but you get used to it and I do not consider this a serious issue. I have not had any problems like the filter not getting water in it etc. I put it by my headboard and close the doors in my master and even on low it gets a bit chilly. We do have a good size bedroom. We have used them consistently for almost 3 years and have not had a problem at all. I also love that the tanks don't spill water everywhere. 2 gallons goes a long way in this machine. Others I have used have to be filled up constantly...Very happy with my purchases.
2,Not UV-proof,"This unit will become discolored from sunlight. There is no UV-protection on the plastic. If you want to use this model for more than one year, don't put it in a windows where the sun shines or you will be disappointed like me with a yellowish-brown color."
4,Winston Debut Displays His R&B Roots,"This is Winston's first album, released back in 1972, almost a decade before the seasonal-themed albums that made him famous. This album provides a glimpse into Winston's roots and influences as his piano style was influenced by Fats Waller and other rhythm and blues pianists. As such, it's not a ""new age"" album like his later releases."
3,does it work,ok everybody is siked by the smell im looking for anti cellulite does it work for that as advertised :)
1,"Do NOT waste your money,",I have had this product for a month. It doesn't work. I have one small vein that I was hoping to get rid of just under my nostril. It hasn't even diminished the appearance of it. A waste of almost $30.
4,I remember watching this in syndication as a child.,"The writing is about the same quality as the original ""Speed Racer,"" which makes it somewhat better than many American cartoons of the era. ""Kimba"" may have been the inspiration for Disney's ""The Lion King,"" which resembles it quite closely."
3,This was a workhorse while it lasted,This product held up well for a number of years. The competitors product I replaced it with is inferior
1,Poorly Made,This would have been a perfect cable if not so poorly constructed. One end fits well but the smaller end fits so poorly the sound cuts in and out to the point of being useless. Does not work with any device I've tried it in.
2,relaxing music,"Personally, I did not find this a very relaxing cd. It had good selections by the original artists, but I didn't find it very soothing, to say, fall asleep with. Good music, but it was too busy to be called relaxing."
1,not so great,"I have horrible posture, this thing is very light and didn't seem to do anything for me. I threw it out."
1,POOR QUALITY,ORDERED A QUANTITY OF THESE FOR AN EXERCISE CLASS. MOST WERE DEFECTIVE AND FELL APART AFTER A COUPLE OF USES/ THE PLASTIC RED PLUG AT THE END THAT HOLDS IT TOGETHER DID NOT FASTEN TO THE INSIDE AS INTENDED. RETURNED THEM AND PURCHASED ANOTHER BRANDDO NOT BUY THESE AS VERY POOR QUALITY CONTROL
4,Good Deal,This is a good deal on this product. I found the exact same barbells at a sporting goods store for $5 more than I paid for them on Amazon. If you need water weights this is the place to buy them.
1,"Oh. My. G... No, just: Oh. My.","Astonishingly, amazingly, alarmingly bad. Just terrible. Not, and I stress this, NOT ""so bad it's funny"". Past that, in fact, and out the other side to ""so bad I cried for the trees that lost their lives"".Really, I mean it: horrible, horrendous abuse of the concept of ""novel"".All else aside, this book *does* serve well as proof that editors can't be replaced by ""spell-check"". Look at the author's own statement above, for example: ""constant run-in""? ""No, Tom and I aren't married or anything, we're just having a constant run-in. Yeah, been 12 years now.""Or my personal favorite, from the book, the (mobile?) blue glow emancipating from the closet, er, wait- now it's in the basement. ""Emancipating from the basement"". Did I miss something? Was Lincoln down there?"
1,Wow,"The author of this book created four different accounts and rated his own book as 5 stars. If he is going to artificially rase his book's rating, I am going to artificially ""deficit"" it. I mean decrease it."
2,Little to offer over the GPS 12,"I really love my Garim GPS 12. It is easy to use and move between screens and features. The Summit is not as easy to use. It is not as convenient to identify way points, does not work with mapping software and its display is to simple. It was not a step up but sideways. I use it in conjunction with my GPS 12 mostly just to keep the track log."
4,Great product but buy rechargable batteries!,"I use the eTrex Summit on my bicycle. I get my trip distance, net climbing, speed, average speed, time of day, sunset, etc from this unit. I also hook it up to my laptop and mapping software for road trips. Now my wife doesn't yell at me to ask directions! Of course, I'm a gadget junky and INVENTED reasons to buy it. If you're going to use it in the car, though, I'd suggest getting the combo cigarette lighter adapter & data cable as the batteries wear down relatively quickly."
5,Darkness and Dawn,Andre Norton is a superb storyteller. I read these two books years ago and was glad to find them again.
3,A fair warning,"A fair warning to the consumer, this production does not utilize wide-angle lenses. Any cute doggy film connoisseur knows that a wide-angle lens (preferably a fisheye) placed impossibly close to the animal's face is the only way to properly represent their true saccharine nature. Adorable doggies on standard lenses? Not adorable enough!"
4,How To Get Out of the Hospital Alive,"Valuable information in this book which I will be sharing at a workshop for senior citizens. In these challenging days of changes in the medical system, it is important to be informed."
4,What size is a #1 ?,I took a chance and lucked out but I would have had to do a serious search to fine just what size #1 really is.Amazon didn't tell me.
5,Melitta Coffee Filters,"I've had a travel size Melittla coffee maker for about 30 years. It uses a #1 filter which have become hard to find in local stores, so I was using #2 filters and cutting them down to size. I finally did a search on Amazon.com and found them and bought enough to last at least another 10 years."
3,filters,"they are fine, just the boxes came all dented up. What else can I say about simple filters? They are what I wanted."
4,A good starter.,"This is a great grinder for the beginner. It is a Bench Grinder that does not use up your bench space. It has it's own stand, which is included. It is very good for most jobs around the shop. Quality is typical of most far east imports. Assembly was very easy. Hardware parts were very oily. If you plan on doing heavy grinding you might consider the 1/2 HP 8"" grinder instead. For the price. I like it. First thing I did: used the built in drill guide to sharpen some drill bits. It worked."
2,Needs improvement,"I used this tea kettle for about one month and I already see rust forming around the spout. I also noticed steam coming out of the cover area when it's starting to boil, which makes the handle moist. The steam doesn't make the handle hot, but it's just a nuisance to grab a wet handle. The spout also opens a bit too easily compared to oxo's older model tea kettles. This is a nice, modern looking tea kettle, with a very convenient handle-spout opening design, but I cannot recommend this product... the quality of it needs to be improved."
5,Mixed feelings of Happiness.!!,"I was so happy to own this cd which I never thought it came out in cd form. I found his album 23 years ago and never bought it. I was very devastated, now that I have it, what a wonderful music it is!!!!"
4,neils own world,well first i am a big neil young fan so take it as it is. I really think this is a great piece of work . hes back to a very smooth voice and talk style no loud yelling which i think is the true sound for neil. the cuts devils sidewalk and carmichael are great songs done in the neil young way with great harmonies and the great sing song way singing very clear with his vocals sounding at top form. if you are a true neil young fan i think you wont have to listen to much of this cd to understand why i put it up there just under harvest moon and comes a time its rock done in a softer way. i really give this cd a big thumbs up.
3,Good Guitar Accompaniment to Britney & the Granola Bars,"I love Neil with Crazy Horse. This album features Crazy Horse. So those of you that love Neil in all his manic ragged Guitar glory he delivers the goods. On the other hand part of me wonders if this whole project wasn'nt just Neil's version of Lolita. He comes up with a simplistic tale as a vehicle to entertain or maybe just to provide an excuse to go on tour with his daughter's hottie school mate in the role of Britney(maybe I am just cynical and he is merely trying to gain a younger audience) In any event the horse and Neil's guitarplaying are great, the story kind a dumb, and the girl is hot in the role of a dancing hiphugger wearing treehugger."
2,"Neil is cool, but this is Booorrrrring...","I admire the scope and amount of work he put into the multimedia aspect of this project, but this music is just plain dull. All of the songs sound the same and barely have coherent melodies. If you really want to subject yourself to Greendale, you might as well watch the DVD or go see it live, at least there's more going on to hold your attention. The second star of the two stars I gave this was for sheer effort."
2,THE NEW WORE OFF REAL QUICK,"I am a big Neil Young fan and have almost all his albums, but I am somewhat dissapointed with Greendale. It was very bland until I watched the DVD. This brought a little more interest to the songs, but still, I could not get into it very much. I am afraid this one might gather dust like Trans and Landing On Water. He has made some of the greatest music of all time, but he has had some real duds also. I cannot even remember the name of his last album before Greendale. I probably played it twice.He is a big talent so maybe his next offering will be more rewarding. Hang in there Neil, I love Ya."
4,Another twist in the road,"Allright. By now you either get Neil Young or you don't and time should not be wasted trying to bring new converts to the fold. This is an ambitious,sprawling effort that misfires at certain points, but overall it works for me. The songs are spare, to be sure, but convey an earnestness and freshness lacking in most overproduced fare. You get the sense that this was a one take recording which sounds live and vibrant. The cd builds narratively and musically to a powerful conclusion, despite the muddled storyline. I would liken it to a stripped down ""Ragged Glory"", with a more consistent musical theme.The bonus dvd is a treasure and is worth the purchase in its own right. It was featured on the Neil's website last month. The liner notes indicate that Pancho was not part of the studio mix, which accounts for his nominal contribution on tour. To conclude, buy it, get in the car, crank it up and go for a long drive."
5,must have,this is a must have for the metal fan! where else you going to see glenn benton belching out obituary. the commentary disc is worth the price of the package.
5,"Brian Jacques jolly does it again, wot!","This book is awesome. It akes place many, many seasons after Taggerung, and Russano the wise is the 5th grandsire of one of the books characters. It starts at Riftgard, where Triss the squirrel, Welfo the hedgehog, and Shogg the otter escape from the claws of King Agarnu and his two children, Prince Bladd and Princess Kurda. Meanwhile, at Redwall Abbey, two dibbuns, members of Dibbuns Against Bedtime, escape and stumble across the ancient entrance of Brockhall. At the mountain of Salamandastron, Sagaxus the badger and Bescarum the hare run away from Redwall with Kroova the sea otter and set off for Redwall Abbey by boat. A tale of mystery, adventure, sadness, and humor(Bescarum eats all food in sight, tries to go after a shark, and whatnot), Brian Jacques writes another great tale."
2,Disappointing,"I am an avid reader, and I have thoroughly enjoyed all the Redwall books. However, I found Triss a huge disappointment. For me, it was just too much of the same stuff in the other Redwall books. I thought it was so boring that I never finished it. And my friends all agree that Triss is sadly lacking the magic of the other Redwall books."
4,Delivered with dead battery,I ordered this watch as a gift to my Uncle who is blind and it arrived not working. I had a new battery put in and it seems to work just fine now. Many stores will not change digital watch batteries so you may have a hard time getting that done if needed. The band came large and was able to easily take a few links out to fit him arm. The watch had a nice appearance and looks much more expensive than it cost on Amazon. It looked much more dressy than the plastic/rubber ones he has had previously. The voice is nice and clear but could be a little louder. Over all it is a great deal for the money.
5,"Bizarre, humorous, and sexually charged",This was my first Jan Svankmajer film which I bought not really knowing what to expect. I loved it but please be advised that this is not for everyone. The movie has music but no spoken words... but don't let that deter you- actions speak louder then words. There is one character in the movie whose sexually deviant actions are highlighted by dramatic opera music- which makes it hilarious. ALso be sure to check out some of the weirdest stop motion stuff I have ever seen in the extra bit included on the disc called FOOD.
2,lacks detailed instruction,"It is great that this book does not bluff claiming to make your reading speed 100 times faster or more. Although the premise (Tripling your reading speed by decreasing eye fixation) is not overstatement, I found this book lacking detailed instruction. The author claims expanding your vision so that you can read more by one eye fixation. But he fails to tell us how to practice for that goal. The book only instructs us to use a chart that look likeA BBD Fand read the outermost letters while fixing your eye to the center ones."
5,Excellent book!,"I've tried the hand-scanning methods, and I really don't like them. This method is more of a 'leap-of-faith.' You have to practice the exercises faithfully. The weird thing is that I didn't notice my reading speed had changed significantly at first. It's a little slower than using the hand-scanning method at first, but offers more long-range benefits. For example, not only can I read faster, but I can do things like scan a store shelf faster and I notice more details in my peripheral vision. This is my favorite book on speed reading - and now my only one. I keep it now to revisit the practice exercises from time to time. Definitely worth it for the ""big picture"" results."
4,Complete Original Suite,"I have to agree with the other reviewer that I miss the familiar ending of the Firebird, because I went to buy it after watching Fantasia 2000. However, the CD booklet says that : ""The concert suite recorded here was made in 1911 and published in 1912. It was the first of three made by Stravinsky and uses almost the same orchestration as the complete ballet score. The two later suites of 1919 and 1945 use a reduced orchestra"". How could I know that there were three versions! On the other hand, this cd includes some of the early works which are not easy to find (there is always a cd with Rite of Spring and Firebird), like Fireworks, the Symphony no 1, and the Scherzo Fantastique. I liked the powerful interpretations of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic. This is a very fine CD for me, and I would also recommend Stravinsky Symphonies with Sir George Solti and the CSO on Decca."
4,Good product,"I like to play the game with manual on hand, so I can cut down the time, since I am not so often to play."
2,THIS SUCKED!,I hated the game and the strategy guide didnt help.FF8 rocked and the strategy guide is alot better.
5,Must give it a five!,"This movie was excellent! I was so surprised that I liked it, I sure didn't expect to! Not only did it have some good drama in it, but my son and I ended up laughing so hard we could hardly breathe at times!Glenn Close did such an excellent job! Her part alone deserves five stars!This is actually going on my list of movies to own! It's great for a good laugh."
3,101 dalmatians,"not bad, this movie is definitely better than the jungle book(94) it some great moments like the bicycle ride and the escape and of cruella is the star of the movie but I think this movei has too much comedy too compete with the original, like the score and the new version of ""Cruella De Vil"".(102 dalmatians coming this fall! woof,woof!)"
4,New batteries for new computers,"Having just acquired a new PowerBook G4, I want to reiterate a previous commenter's reminder that batteries change. I will be giving away or selling three batteries and two adapters from previous PowerBook G4s. The power management specifications for the latest computers are different. The battery for the 15"" PowerBook G4 is smaller, last longer and unable to accidentally dislodge because of a new design. All improvements. Purchasers of new computers might want to budget new backup batteries and adapters along with the computer. Owners of older models should consider buying used batteries and adapters, some of which are new or moderately used."
3,The Bride wore Chocolate,"I rated this book three stars. It was a sweet, humorous novelThe storyline was pretty good. I enjoyed the best friends and quirky family of the heroine, Candace. The hero Michael was likable.There were chocolate recipies at the front of each chapter that tied into the story.I'm not sure what went wrong with this book for me. I noted all the high ratings before I bought it. But to me it just was not a favorite. I felt like there was too much almost juvenile humor this book. The heroine was never at ease with her engagement.It just wasn't a favorite book of mine.I was able to finish the book so it wasn't a total loss."
3,meh...its alright,"The humidifier itself works fine (it humidifies as its supposed to), but Duracraft claims that it automatically turns off when it runs out of water - which it DOES NOT!!! I left it on once during the day while I went to work, came home, no water in it, and it was still on, steaming hot. Probably could've caused a fire if I had been away from home any longer. DON'T LEAVE IT ON AND ASSUME THE AUTO-TURN OFF WORKS!!!"
2,MILDEW + Humidifier = bacterial infection?,"This humidifier seemed to work really well for the first few days. But after the 3rd or 4th day, I noticed a lot of mildew growing inside the unit. So, I cleaned the unit almost daily, but despite my scrubbing, it always came back (no big surprise, I suppose... heat + water + dark enclosed space = mildew). In fact, it was stained onto the unit so badly that no amount of scrubbing seemed to get rid of it all.The problem is, I think I may have developed a bacterial infection from the mildew. I can't be sure, of course, since this is flu season. But I couldn't shake this sore throat and congestion for weeks. Then after a round of antibiotics, it went away. Soon after, I started using the humidifier again... and lo and behold, my symptoms returned.It's not a definite correlation, but I'm definitely NOT going to use this thing anymore."
3,Not as advertised,"This works great - I have used the same brand humidifier for years. However, this is NOT a 2 1/2 gallon tank as advertised. Only about 1/2 gallon. It will last thru the night on low, but not on high. I am very disappointed that they don't seem to believe in truth in advertising. I may return it just because of that."
2,works but advertised wrong,"This is not 2 1/2 gallon tank. More like 1/2 gallon tank that has to be refilled everyday. It's quiet and puts up plenty of moisture but I really wanted something a lot bigger in holding capacity for the house. Since it is small, we tend to use it in the bedrooms when someone is sick...."
5,Great product a super fast,"Thank you to the seller for accommodating my request to send my humidifier right away. After reading the reviews, I had to get one for my 4 month old baby who has been sick with a cold and needed another humidifier, a more efficient one to help him get better and feel more comfortable. The humidifier is working like a charm. The humidity levels in the room have gone way up and it feels tropical-like. Anyone will be pleased with this product."
3,"eh, decent...","Well i dediced to buy a humidifier after years of getting bloddy noses from the dryness in the winter, so far i haven't gotten any (that could also be because iv'e been breathing out my nose more and not in because of the moisture from your lungs). i also bought a humidity monitory thingy, and it seems that this humidifier can only increase the humidity just a little 5%-10% at most.But what i love is the little medicine cup on top, i bought some oils and put them in there, and wow. it smells great."
1,Alot missing from this CD,"Why, why do they bother with these greatest hit collections, if they aren't going to put ALL the hits on the record? No less than 4 of Lee Roy's best songs are missing from this compilation, specifically: ""Power of Love""; ""Givin' Water to a Drowning Man""; the collaboration with Brooks and Dunn, ""Take These Chains from My Heart""; and my personal favorite, ""You Can't Get There from Here"".This cd is a waste of money without those other songs, in my opinion."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable sound stays. You'll want to listen over and over.,"Every song is tight. New World Baby has a raw electric seventies quality. Mao/Marilyn - lyrically intriguing with a melody that resonates long after the song ends. Jody Said - mellow and introspective with beautiful slide work (Can't help but think of Pink Floyd for few bars). Tokyo Lucky Hole - fun upbeat rock with Josh's signature guitar sound. Midnight Rider psychodelic, atmospheric. Black Moon - Folk solo acoustic and vocal harmony. Overall this EP is easy to love. Can't wait for the next CD."
4,includes some selections that are unique to this project,"1986, Windham Hill WD-0700, currently out of print.Michael Hedges' musical score for a 1986 Rabbit Ears childrens video narrated by Kelly McGillis (Rabbit Ears Productions/Childrens Video Library catalog #5390). The score includes some selections that are unique to this project: track 2 (an instrumental version of ""Ready or Not""), and tracks 5 and 6.Michael Hedges: acoustic guitar, harp-guitar, acoustic bass guitar, flute1. Santabear's First Christmas (narration with music)2. Ready or Not (instrumental; vocal version appears on Live on the Double Planet)3. The Double Planet4. Eleven Small Cubs *5. Larry's Instrumental6. Carol Jean* ""Eleven Small Cubs"" is a re-recording of ""Eleven Small Roaches"" from Breakfast in the Field.Produced by Michael Hedges and Mark Sottnick.Recorded at Different Fur Recording, San Francisco, CA."
4,Grade B Roth,This is Roth's effort at being Kafka. But the transformation made here does not have the striking originality and effectiveness that Kafka's does. Roth has a formula here which he plays out to the end. And the whole premise of the work is simply not very interesting. With Roth the effort to prove and justify is strong and this often leads to some of his worse fiction. This is mediocre Roth which means its language still has a vitality greater than most. But it does not convince and it does not move. It appears that the formula disappears once one seeks for true elegance.
3,Very weird movie,This movie was a total shocker for me. I watched it with friend one night while have a girls night. I didn't know what to expect when I popped it in. The cover so innocent. But we were both in for a surprise. Our mouths were gaped open much of the movie. It tells of 5 stories each with a twist at the end. If nothing else it was interesting to watch. It was very weird but at times disturbingly funny.
2,Not for the faint of heart,"Well I can't say that I wasn't warned when I ordered this film. I wasn't so much offended as deeply disquieted and uncomfortable. The stories were attention-getting and depressing. I watched them with two like-minded friends (and we're talking middle-aged women here, so if you're not, midlife and female that is, you needn't take this review to heart), and not a one of us could voice anything gained save gloom as a result of the viewing."
1,Sick and disgusting,I was out. When I walked in my wife was watching this movie on Netflix. First thing I saw was one guy on top of another having anal sex. Then one of them went out to find a little girl who apparently ran outside. She was tucked into bed and one of the character says ohhh finger me daddy. Needles to say that was all I could take and she chose another movie. It's not a funny movie it's just disgusting.
3,Question sets by organ system,This is a good book to review for the Step 1 of the USMLE. It is divided into 8 Organ system sections and each subsection consists of clinical scenarios describing a common disease that affects the specific organ system followed by 3 questions regarding the anatomy/physiology/normal processes involved plus one question about the pathophysiology. The explanations are OK. This books would be excellent if they had included at least 6 questions per case and if the explanations section had some diagrams.
2,An moderately entertaining research paper...,"As an Elton John fan for the past 30 years, I can't fault Ms. Rosenthal's enthusiasm for her subject -- it's obvious she's followed the ups and downs of Sir Elton's life, and has a very good grasp on her subject, tantrums, tiaras, and all. However, I was hoping for more; some new and/or different information than has previously been distributed via all of the usual sources, including Elton himself. No such luck. The title is apt: this book ultimately reads like a well-researched and documented paper on the music of Elton John, with no new information regarding the man himself. My only true quarrel with this work would have to be the author's occasional tendency to editorialize and let her preferences and biases toward (or against) periods of his music or specific songs slip through. For those looking for details on the songs to the n-th degree, you won't be disappointed. But if you're looking for more than that, I would suggest you look elsewhere."
3,"LOVE the DVD, but it was not a ""new"" item, as listed","I love this DVD. I have had it for both of my daughters and bought it for my Grandaughter. However, it was sold to me as ""new"" and was not. The case was broken, It was shrink wrapped, scratched and we could tell it was not a ""new"" item. I am sending it back, but the person I got it from will not replace the item, only give a refund. So now I have to find another one. Will not purchase from this seller again."
2,disappointing.,I was hoping it would be as good as the Vol.1. But I am disappointed to find that this Vol.2 didn't measure up to the first Vol.
4,It's a low budget hit!,"My son has responded to this video from an infant. Now he is 2, and still loves it, singing with it, and knows all the songs. He is not much of a video watcher at 2, since he seems to busy for tv, however there's something about this collection of Mother Goose ryhmes that he really connects with. So I would give this video 2 thumbs up!"
2,the pillow book,i didn't care much for the movie. i just wanted to see ewan mcgregor's weiner. it was worth every cent i paid for.
1,Absolute Trash,Tortuous to watch - like a two hour long Chanel No. 5 commercial. Good only for men with Asian fetishes.
1,Very bad mastering!,"This DVD has the worst mastering I have ever seen.While still images are often exquisitely detailed,moving objects detach from their backgrounds andwallpaper patterns dance. Such compression artefactsare extremely distracting and made watching thisDVD a frustrating and disappointing experience."
1,ahem....,If your idea of a good movie is watching Ewan McGregor walking around naked with his uncut equipment flopping around going from sex with one fat old asian man to another then yeah you'll love this movie and you can hide behind the same critiques about the films mis en scene that these other critics are blowing hot air about. Otherwise forget it. This film is both boring and disturbing and not in a cool way either. There are some colorful visuals with the beautiful young starlet and her fetish for writing Mandarin on bodies but it doesn't save the film. How are we supposed to take him seriously as Obi Wan after seeing this?
1,bring on that colostomy bag.........,"Watching this so called movie was as entertaining and pleasurable as getting my teeth pulled(without anesthetic).In every possible way the movie is suppose to be touching,enlightening,imaginative,spiritual and so on.....when it is actually disconnected,confusing ""designer trash"".At no point and time could I relate or connect with this movie or it's characters... and in my final analysis; Pillow Books'gratuitous full frontal male nudity(gathering from what i've read from other reviews)has ""profoundly"" compensated some women for the female nudity they've seen in other movies.If that is not corruption of one's sense of decency..what is?Me personally..I would rather slurp my next can of soup through a used colostomy bag than have to view this trash again.Easily, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Watch it, and you'll be begging for those two hours back when you pass."
2,seconds,I recieved the mount kit in the time frame that was given. When I went to install the mount system the mounting hole on the mount was not taped the screw that qwas provided di not fit. It was to short for the bow fram.I had to tap out the mount and use the same screw that was on the red dot scope.I cannot believe that Amazon is alowing seconds to be sold at top quality prices. If I did not need it so fast I would have returned it for my money back. Be very werry of this item.
5,An Excellent Novel Around Factual Events,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Writing a gripping piece of fiction amid factual events can't be easy. The book is masterfully done.I'd like to defend the ending of the book against those who found the ending very disappointing. I was surprised by the ending & didn't see it coming until just before the event happened. Anyone who could have proven the missile theory of flight 800 is vaporized along with the evidence. The ending takes the reader out of the novel back into reality which smacks of cover-up & is the authors vision of why we'll never know the truth. The entire book revolves around this piece of evidence & by a twist of fate it's lost forever.If you don't look at the ending as a quick way to end a story and see the ending for what it was intended, you'll love the book"
3,Night Fall below bar set by Esau Swindle,"Dr.Solde's online review got me reading The Esau Swindle. I'd been looking for a new thriller and checked Night Fall to find out what's hot. Low and behold, The Esau Swindle by Gerald Rothberg popped up. Rothberg's incredible blend of jealous love, mystery, spine chilling suspense, art forgery and greed rocked me. As a physician, I'd been looking for a good book these last few days to clear my mind from daily practice. The Esau Swindle did it. Thank you Dr. Solde. I intend to let other physician's know about this great new page turner."
2,I feel like a sucker!,"DeMille is a great author, but this book wasn't that great. I felt like a total sucker after I read it. Can I get my money back?"
3,"Entertaining, not DeMille's best.","I am a big fan of Nelson DeMille. My favorite thing about him is the way he spins interesting and intriguing stories told through the eyes of sarcastically humorous protagonists. You get this in Night Fall - with vintage John Corey, a hardened NYC cop that is now working for the bad guys (FBI). The story is interesting - especially because it parallels the real life event of the 'mechanical failure' of TWA flight 800, but also because of it's post 9/11 relevance. Overall this is a quick and enjoyable read, but if you wan't the best of DeMille, I suggest Gold Coast, or John Corey's debut; Plum Island.I am anxiously awaiting his next book; we get a hint from DeMilles web site, 'I am currently working on a novel, untitled, about an Islamic plot to detonate an atomic device in a major American city.'"
3,"Good, Not Demille's Best","I really enjoyed reading Night Fall. It is quite the page turner and a fast read when compared to other Demille books, due mainly to the content & reduced page numbers (short for Demille). The character develpment isn't as much as previous Corey books have been. It is more like watching a tv show or movie unfold where you are already familiar with the characters. Not too complex, although it does throw you for a loop at the end (although I saw it coming!).I've enjoyed every John Corey book. He's so sarcastic it's great. It was like seeing an old friend. Lets hope Demille keeps up with this great character!My favorite books of Demille's are Up Country, Gold Coast, & Plum Island (another Corey book)."
5,Amazing read,"DeMille starts off by explaining that he has taken certain literary license with the facts of the TWA 800 crash. The book was suspenseful and addictive. If you don't read this book, you're really missing out. The best part is, you'll never see the ending coming."
4,DeMille & Corey = A Great Combination,"Night Fall by Nelson DeMille is yet another example of one of the finest authors out there flexing his writing prowess. DeMille has struck gold with the enigmatic John Corey. This ""possible"" true tale is a gripping story about a potential cover-up. Is it far-fetched? Not really? But DeMille has a great way of making stories ring true. From Cathedral to Wild Fire, any tale that DeMille weaves is generally so well-written that it seems to be non-fiction. I note that there are several complaints by other reviewers about the emptiness they felt over the final chapter(s) in the book. Sometimes things don't wrap up perfectly, and sometimes they do. I encourage readers to take this worthy journey and determine for yourselves if this ending rings true. Enjoy!"
1,Tedious and contrived,"Well, my review title says it all. I really enjoyed DeMille's first two books featuring John Corey, but this one was a major disappointment. I found the first half to be like slogging through quicksand - though I kept reading and turning pages, I didn't seem to be getting anywhere. So many pages, so little action of consequence.... I skimmed the last half, only to come to an incredibly contrived ending. Although I like DeMille in general, I would suggest skipping this one."
2,Very Disappointing,"I love Nelson DeMille. I can't wait for his new books to be published. This one is very disappointing. Mr. DeMille has a clever idea and spends 500 pages writing and re-writing the same thing. It is redundancy to the point of being maddening. As usual, there is clever dialogue but without the usual depth and richness. Don't waste your time. Read (or re-read) Charm School or UpCountry instead. Sorry."
2,Meh,"Just to lay the facts out, I usually like Nelson Demille's works. This book had a lot of promise. I found myself flipping through the pages following the story, waiting for some sense of closure.Instead the ending was ""the past 650 pages were just a preamble to the next book which may actually have something to do with the plot established in the first chapter and then ignored for the rest of the book"".Very disappointing. I expect, when reading a Demille novel, to have purpose and closure at the end, even if they end up somewhat vague. This novel really disappoints."
3,GREAT until the HORRIBLE ending,"Others have stated this but what a shame that an incredible book like this had such a cop (as in apathetic) out ending. The tension builds and builds and you're ready for what's going to go down........and nothing does. You never find out the ""truth."" In an interview with the author on the audio CD, he said his 23yr old son picked out the ending for him. Bad mistake to listen to him. This was such a great book about 90% through with a very disappointing ending. What a letdown."
3,Okay if you don't think about it too much,"I generally enjoy John Corey and Demille's manner of story telling, however, Night Fall was a big let down and I would rather have not even started it. The story was contrived and extremely predictable. If you put any thought into where the story is going you will likely be frustrated about halfway through it."
3,Extremely disappointed,"Very much enjoy Nelson DeMille and the sarcastic John Corey, he is how I would expect some or most NY detectives to behave or act. I read Plum Island and throughly enjoyed the book and the style. However I was very disappointed in the outcome of Night Fall. I liked the fact the author through John Corey was going to give us a alternative outcome to a highly reconizable event that happened in my lifetime. Unfortunately Mr. Demille decided to take us on a journey toward the end then led us to a trap door that only left us scratching our heads. It was a copout ending, no pun intended. He should have led us to the confrontation and alternative ending to this saga. He didn't and left me scratching my head and wondering why."
3,John Corey is too glib,I have read all of DeMille's novels and this is not one of his best efforts. I find John Corey to be too cute by half.
4,cool,"It is a greatly satisfying read. The pace is slow, there are practically no events but the tension is high. The ""detective work"" is very good. And it is informative. A really good movie could be made out of this material.The problems are relatively minor: it does not seem like such a good idea for a man under a watchful eye to constantly call his former partner and I do not see any crime in being a colorless investment banker. But this is a pretty minor stuff."
3,Sorry Nelson...,"...but I did not think Night Fall was as good as your prior efforts with these same characters. I still read it cover to cover, so I'm not 100% sure why I thought it was only average, perhaps it just wasn't as intense as this was a ""cold case"" as opposed to working an active case. Interesting premise though."
2,Am I the only one?,"Okay, am I the only reader who was put off by the premise of this book? I'm a huge DeMille fan, but this smacked of tasteless exploitation. While it's interesting to use real life tragedies as fodder for novels when they are way in the past (the sinking of the Titantic, bombing of Pearl Harbor, etc.) and the people who were affected firsthand are no longer alive, it's a whole different thing to expound conspiracy theories about things that happened just a few years ago. People are still grieving for their loved ones, for God's sake! And tidied up so neatly at the end! No need to actually offer any meaningful basis for the supposed coverup. Sorry, but the whole thing left me feeling cheated and disappointed in Demille."
1,All very predictable,The first chapter sets up the Flight 800 coverup and then we spend the rest of the book emersed in gossip and predictable scenerios. He acted as if we didn't remember that the 9/11 disaster happened just after Labor Day 2001. One plus - DeMille's cop humor is very good. Could have made it a short story and I would have been much happier.
3,Problem with tape gimmick,"So the illicit lovers watch the sun sink into the Atlantic. Posssible from Ireland, not Long Island.What's this about Jill erasing the tape, but FBI can recover image if not recorded over. That's how you erase a tape. Unless you have a big magnet. It's not like a computer disk.Most improbable that Jill figures she's got 40 minutes to make duplicate tape, while boyfriend showers."
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Nelson DeMille. He is my favorite author. But this was a weak effort. The first 100 pages (of 485) slog along at a snail's pace. The action picks up soon thereafter and builds strongly to about 450, but then it treads water for about 30 pages before fizzling out. DeMille states in the acknowledgements that his 24 year-old son helped him with the ending - - and it shows! I found it a giant cop-out and utterly dissatisfying. Now I anxiously wait for DeMille's next novel, due out late this year. I only hope it's the ""old"" Nelson DeMille who authors it."
3,HOpe for a Sequel,"It is always interesting and instructive to read the on line reviews. Like so many thrillers this one brings strong emotions on each side-- some were enthralled and others bored. I am a big DeMille fan and enjoyed Up Country and the previous Corey books. As in those, the writing is fun. The difficulty with this book is that it seems that the story was a way used to put forth a theory. The last third of the book was actually silly and the ending was unacceptable.The conspiracy theory is always dangerous but especially as in this case when there does not seem to be any motive for the conspiracy. Maybe there will be a sequel when a reason for the alleged conspiracy can be explained."
1,What a waste of time!,"Two of the most enjoyable novels I've ever read are by Nelson DeMille - The Charm School and Lion's Game. This one, unfortunately, was a real lemon. The book is slow until the last third, then it races to a rather unsatisying non-conclusion. When I finished it, I threw it away . . ."
4,"Good read, bad beginning","I enjoyed this book tremendously but I almost stopped after the first chapter. A lot of people will gush over realism but I did not think the soft porn was necessary to draw readers into the book. Many authors substitute titillation for plot, this book did not need it.I was never satisfied with the official explanations of the events. A friend of mine ran simulations and said the CIA animation was not possible. I think we were all lied to,"
3,Another Great Demille book followed by a weak ending,"I'd love to give rave reviews on this book, but unfortunately, I'm very disappointed in the ending... again.In the Lion's Game, I was let down by the ending that was both lacking in finality and left the reader with a vague idea of what actually happened.In Night Fall, there is less to leave to the imagination so the ambiguity is not exactly there, but the ending was quite weak. So much drama is built up towards the end and with the climax ultimately starting to peak, and as the reader thinks to themself, how is the protagonist John Correy going to figure out this situation, boom... a major let down.Also, I noticed that Night Fall builds upon some relationship building that the Lion's Game established. I liked the idea of rewarding a Demille fan with some continuity, but really think it should be noted that the Lions Game should be read first. If the book does offer this suggestion, then I missed it."
2,"DeMille is always fun to read, but this book doesn't quite cut it.","I'm a little perplexed at some of the positive reviews here on Amazon. Compared to DeMille's awesome book, ""The Gold Coast"", this book is silly. I don't want to give the plot away, but to me, the whole thesis is flawed from the lense cap of a video camera left on a blanket outside making police wonder if there is a video of the TWA flight 800 incident (isn't that just wishful thinking?) to the notion that every move John Corey makes is being monitored by nervous bosses who are covering up what really happened.Nelson, this book was ill conceived and didn't work that well even though your sense of humor is still pretty good. Focus, quit drinking so much scotch and do a better job next time. I'm a disappointed fan."
4,Redundancy is good,"One good thing about this Unabridged Audio CD is that you don't have to listen really close because the important stuff will be repeated somewhere along the line. As an example, the opening scene is repeated in graphic detail later in the book. This scene would be ""R"" rated if a movie, and, even though you might skip the first chapter, it will be hard to cover little ears when it is repeated, buried deep within the book. Because of this repeated scene and some rather coarse language, I wouldn't listen to the audio book in a car full of kids.All in all, this is an entertaining book. It is a good mystery, and has some really funny one liners. Based on a historical event that has been surrounded by controversy, the author admitted in an interview that he had worked himself into a corner and his son had to find the ending for him.It lasted about 1000 miles of Interstate, which was just about right since, as inferred above, the driver wasn't distracted trying to keep up with things."
2,Confused about the tapes,"I thought they made a second copy of the tape at her home. If the first tape was taken from the hotel vault, where did the other copy go?"
4,Great read but I want a better ending,"Great read as all of DeMille's books are. Yeah, so he writes with similar styles book after book. Still, the best ones were his early ones like Charm School and Gold Coast. I thought Plum Island was mediocre and this was better.Great mix between fact and fiction - I still don't know what really happened. Have never read a book that mixed the lines so clearly so you never know what is and isn't.I recommend it - heck i finished it in 5 hours on a plane. Quick reading for sure."
5,Pretty Good!,"There is nothing really to say, a lot better than a band or a rope provides a variety of safe stretches."
5,"Good product, quick shipping","Product came as advertised, and works great. I'm a strong guy, so the strong stitching to prevent it from tearing under my strain is greatly appreciated. I'm also a personal trainer and physical therapy rehabilitation tech, and HAVE already recommended it to clients."
3,Depends on your needs,"If you aren't very flexible (i.e. overweight or elderly) then this can be a god-send. But for the most part, I found I could do all the stretches just as effectively, if not more effectively, without it than I could with it."
3,Not as enjoyable as others by this author.,"I know what Robert Barnard was trying to do with this book, but somehow I feel that he fell somewhat short. The main character is an eighty year old woman who is looking back at her early life in an Australian outback and the book keeps flashing back to this. The setting is in modern-day London, but Bettina is rethinking her early teenage years, and an event that changed her life. Barnard tries to mix past and present, but it doesn't appear as seamless as it should. The better parts of this book are the flashback sequences. I had figured out the real culprit in all this early-on, and it didn't make sense why Bettina, who knew who the guilty person was, did not make it known to the police, especially when her dear friend is attacked in Bettina's suite. Anyway, Barnard is a good suspense writer, and the book is good enough to merit a little time spent."
2,Boring Book,"As a big Barnard fan, I found this the most boring of his books. The characters seem stereotypical and the plot not particularly creative. It reads more like something done to a general pattern than born of his usually individualistic mindset. Maybe it's just my mood, but I expected more and am disappointed."
3,hard core gamers only need apply,I bought the game after playing the demo version. If I had known how truly hard it is to be good at this game I probably would have selected another.I was looking for a slightly more simple game where details didnt have to be quite so demanding.
3,Not low impact,"I thought this dvd was just okay. I personally didn't like the moves (too basic/boring for my taste) and it didn't make me sweat compared to other exercise routines. I think it is okay for beginners. However, I didn't think it was this much low-impact because there are some jumps and you have to twist your feet quite a bit too (be careful with the knees). Using dance shoes may help instead of barefoot."
4,The good news of Judas,"Gospel of Judas is good news indeed, but only if you have an open mind concerning history and how it was recorded and transmitted. If you have made up your made about the ""truth"" and believe you have ""the whole truth and nothing but the truth"", this is not for you. It is a very revealing account about a very plausible take on the affairs surrounding the ""greatest betrayal of all time"". Even dyed-in-the-wool conservative Christians will have to admit that without Judas they would not have had a ""sacrificial lamb"" or saviour - so even they owe Judas a note of thanks, but that he may have actually been a close friend of Jesus is revealed in a most convincing way through this account."
4,interesting book,"I did have nice time with this book, but not to much new informations for someone who is looking for more history. Easy to read."
5,These books are not for everyone,The Gospel of Judas is the lost Gospel of Judas Iscariot with commentary. It is considered a Gnostic gospel since it discusses things not generally accepted by the Christian faiths. People reading these gospels will need to be open minded and willing to draw their own conclusions about the validity of the information. There is a lot of great historical information about the discovery of this gospel and several other Gnostic gospels including the Dead Sea Scrolls. I have been able to draw some new conclusions for myself since reading this and other lost gospels.
5,"Patchy, but Good","Granted, there is not much left of Judas due to where and how it was kept, but it follows in classic Gnostic form: Judas, the ""author"", is the only disciple who gets it. It is good to get to see the ""Judas"" perspective after 2 millenia of demonizing. 'Tradition' says Judas was evil, but this says what I've always sort of felt and believed, Judas was just doing the job he was put here to do, just playing his part."
4,New perspective,"If you ever wondered why G_D would condemn Judas when ""his actions"" were actually necessary in the ""greater scheme of things"", this book offers another perspective. I find this version a bit easier to accept."
5,perfect,This book arrived on time in perfect condition for a present for a college student who doesn't want to take a Latin class but wanted Latin phrases easily accessed when reading or hearing Latin phrases inserted into conversation. The student was very pleased to receive this. Amazon came through with the perfect product as usual.
2,"Disappointingly dull, lackluster Mozart","Could this be the same Abbado who just gave us on CD a wonderfully exciting, vibrant and expressive performance of Mahler's ""Das Knaben Wunderhorn?"" You'd never guess it from the enervated, plodding and listless versions of Mozart's Requiem and a couple of other sacred pieces here. The singing is adequate but not great or memorable, but it's the seemingly perfunctory conducting that deadens the entire disc. Go for Davis (especially), Marriner, Schreier or Gardiner if you want a spirited, gripping Mozart Requiem."
3,Good book,A decent book. I was interested in the subject and the title caught my eye. The book arrived in time and in condition promised.
5,wonderful xmas movie,This is one of the cutest christmas movies out there. Dudley Moore is so charming as Patch the elf and John Lithgow isas always a wonderful bad guy. If you don't enjoy this movie...you must be Scrooge.
2,Santa Claus: the Movie,I thought the sound quality was poor. I had to turn it way up to be able to hear the voices but it made the background noises too loud.
3,Nice Movie but the product detail is wrong.,"The Details of this product is as follows:Format: AC-3, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Subtitled, WidescreenLanguage: EnglishSubtitles: English, GermanActually this is not a DTS Sound, the sound is only 2.0There are no subtitles at all.I'm very dissapointed."
4,wonderful way of explaining Santa Claus to young children,"The first part of this movie is magical as an explanation of how Santa Claus came to be a legend. All of the stories about Santa, why his suit is red, how all the toys get made, etc are artfully used. The second part of the movie sadly deteriorates as time moves to the present. I have watched this video with my handicapped son who remains childlike as an adult for many years and it is one of the loveliest things about our Christmas."
3,Anti-climatic satire,"Hunter isn't an innovator or even a trendsetter; he is just invisible in his search for all things cool. Until he meets the ultimate innovator of cool, Jen. Together they set out for a wild ride to protect coolness as we know it but find that maybe ""cool"" needs to be change up every once in awhile.In the usual Westfield style, this book hits modern satire head on, making readers question what makes cool and why we are all so set on finding it. The characters are also amazing examples of what every teen wants to be--a trendsetter who gets recognized for his/her creativity. But the plot falls flat with an anti-climactic ending. After rooftop chases, mind-altering TV and uber-cool shoelaces, the ending doesn't deliver that punch that is needed to round out the story. Even the history lessons in useless facts and interesting typographic parodies cannot make up for the letdown."
3,Fell Flat....,"Great premise, and great start to a somewhat promising novel, but halfway through it fell flat. I wanted more from the characters, as they weren't complete in my opinion. It had elements of a good modern suspense novel, and then----nothing."
1,This razor is terrible,"Don't buy this razor PERIOD. I have owned it for a short time and now it won't hold a charge. After some research online, I found this is a trend among this model."
3,Received damaged due to inadequate packing,"Before ordering this item I saw reviews stating that it had been received damaged. The same happened to my order. Evidently Amazon is unable to rectify this type of problem. I made a complaint by email and by telephone. Amazon will replace items and provide a refund. The agent I spoke to said he could pass my complaint onto the shipping department, but there is no feedback mechanism in place which, acknowledges receipt of the complaint by that department and its intent to improve packing in future. Without that I will not order this item from Amazon again."
3,grumpy,about every month or month and a half i order dvd blanks. i reorder when i need a new batch. this outfit cavalierly gave a target date of 7-16 to the 21st. they charged $10 for handling my order which i felt should cover fed ex handling but i sense that the vendor is going to drop the product in the U.S. mail. I have no way of contacting my local post office to track the order. the post office tells me that the tracking number is for a pallet not for my individual package.the other issue is that the vendor hasn't shipped the dvds. If the outfit didn't have 2 spindles then they should not be part of the program. they advertised that they had the spindles in stock. i would recommend that you drop this outfit from the ranks.
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I won't use anything but Maxell DVDs, and they are hard to find. But after reading reviews about the way these were shipped from Amazon and had arrived in a mess, I was a little skeptical. Even so, I have never had a problem with Amazon and decided to just go for it. I was not disappointed. The tower was so well packed that even though the box itself arrived mashed on one end and the plastic cover was cracked, the DVDs were not even affected. Again my faith in Amazon customer service has been justified."
2,Another Terrible Packaging Job,I received my package today and as with other reviewers the disks were strewn throughout the box. One spindle was still together although the base was broken. I guess my Amazon Prime didn't help.
1,Packaging issue,"I'm not sure why Amazon has not solved this problem, but I received my discs with the spindle broken and plastic container cracked. It was due to poor packaging on Amazon's part. Fortunately, no discs were damaged and they work perfectly, but next time I will pay a couple extra bucks and purchase them at Best Buy or somewhere other than Amazon."
1,I can't believe the packaging problem hasn't been addressed!!,"I read the reviews and, being somewhat of an optimist, figured Amazon MUST have addressed the packaging situation that so many customers have had problems with. I received my package in the mail today and the DVDs were strewn all over the box!! I'm disgusted - so much for having my DVDs done in time for a Christmas project!"
3,Barley Entertaining,If you want to be entertained but not into deep thought then Cold is the Grave suits your purposes. It is not challenging by any stretch but it keeps the interest enough to motivate the reader to keep reading even when the outcome is clear. The writing is straight forward by the foreshadowing is heavy handed and hammy. Mr. Robinson has fallen into that familiar trap of continuing a character that was fresh and new to the point of staleness.
5,Nothing short of majestic.,"By the time the two albums featured on this CD were released in 1980 and 1982 the urban R&B market was going through many changes--thankfully, The O'Jays were able to maintain their high-quality output throughout the decade with superb tracks like ""I Like To See Us Get Down"", ""Don't Walk Away Mad"", ""Your Body's Here With Me"", ""Girl, Don't Let It Get You Down"", ""To Prove My Love"" and ""Once Is Not Enough"" being just as good as any of the group's previous Philadelphia International recordings. In retrospect, these two albums provided the O'Jays with a smooth transition from the 1970s to the '80s."
4,A Page Turner,"In Love and War is worth the money. This was a very good book, a definite page turner."
1,Don't Bother!,"This sausage has no flavor other than salt! I could not taste ANY fennel at all in it, or whiskey either! I was very disappointed in the product."
3,Fun film to rent.,"This movie has cheap special effects,I guess to reflect more of the lead characters persona. But i really enjoyed watching Sasha Grey."
5,"Lush, Classic Monroe","It is easy to see why the steamy passions displayed on screen in this film , spilled over into real life, getting Yves Montand in trouble with his wife Simone Signoret. This film showcases the many talents of Marilyn and the atmosphere of the Beatnik era influenced experimental theatre of Greenwich Village of the early 60's. Although the story is a bit far fetched -- a Super-Rich man desparate for the affections of a pretty girl, and going to many typical Hollywood devices to try to win her over, in the end it falls to chemistry and charm to make this movie a pleasure to watch. It has enough entertaining musical numbers to keep it light."
4,I love this movie,"I am a big Marilyn fan, and LOVE this movie!! It is romantic, funny, and entertaining. I really enjoy the music & dance scenes, and the chemistry between Montand and Marilyn is incredible! Tony Randall and Frankie Vaughan are great, too! The guest appearances by Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly and Milton Berle are delightful! I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a romantic, musical film."
2,Really just 1900 mah cells???,"These batteries seem to be rated rather enthusiastically. My LaCrosse BC-700 (set at 700ma charge / 350ma discharge) shows them to be a smidgen over 1900 mah. At around $30 / 20 cells they may still be a good value, but don't expect to see the stated capacity.A second weirdness with these batteries is that they take 4 charge/discharg cycles to get anywhere near even the 1900mah capacity. The cells did all get an initial out of the box top-off charge and were then put into service in a handheld GPS that turned off in under an hour. I'd estimate <200mah for cycle #1. The rest of the cycles were on my BC-700 set to the above test test mode.mah vs charge cycle._#1_ _#2_ _#3_ _#4_ _#5_<200 358 1071 1841 1898<200 486 1210 1884 1916<200 561 1981 1900 1950<200 652 1335 1882 1926"
2,Poor quality,"I've charged most of this package and none of the batteries charges to more than 2000Mah. The 2,650Mah claim is false on its face. These batteries are cheap and I'm not sure they're worth the price."
3,"Not great, not terrible...","The delivery was great--it arrived very quickly and without any pains. The material isn't that bad, to be honest. It has a nice feel to it. The strings are alright, but I'm not sure they'll last through much wear and tear. Same for the fabric. I'd say this is good for show--probably not your best choice if you plan on running around (a.k.a.: don't buy for LARPing). I wasn't impressed at the lack of mention on the armholes. The length of the cloak is good for not tripping over. The hood... is 'eh', at best. The way the fabric was sewn gives the top a dome look, similar to the picture. There was already a hole in the seaming along the hood, too. For the price... not terrible. But not great."
3,AVERAGE AT BEST,"i bought this tape for my nephew, who upon seeing a marathon on MTV2 months ago, loved this show.. i am disappointed there isnt more episodes on tape, but, bought this for him for christmas. based on the other reviews, i thought it would be great. well, it wasnt.. average at best.. the fights were short or non-existent, and the talking in between was too long.. some scenes were funny, but overall this tape was not up to the later episodes which had more fighting..."
5,Don't be put off by the low price,"Don't be put off by the low price or the plastic construction. This thing is very nice.I've used lots of effects pedals over the past 30 years. This one is great for these reasons:1) The range of adjustment on each of the three controls is sufficient and linear. There are not ""cliffs"" or ""stair steps"" in response, so it's very easy to fine-tune your sound.2) Unlike some distortion pedals, this thing is not all fuzz. Yes, wide open, it's pretty fuzzed up, but at lesser settings, this thing delivers some nice subtlety.3) The controls, the foot-button, and the rubberized-bottom all feel well made. Yes, it's plastic, but used at home, I'm not worried about durability.The Only Negative: It's pretty light in terms of mass. I've always liked really heavy pedals (they stay put!). So I wish this thing had a bit more mass.That's it. I say go for it!"
4,OK but uses a lot of power,"Since this didn't come with a 9v adaptor,i just used the 9v batteries. BOY does this thing eat through power. It finished 2 batteries in a month. If you buy this, I highly recommend you get the charger too because you'll be spending a lot of money on batteries. Other than this complaint, it works fine and theres a nice blue light to tell you when its on or off."
3,Swashbuckler that lacks facts,"The Angel's Command is a good story, but the first half of the book, the naval part, was all wrong. To start with, the naval slang used by crews from the three ships is not right. Real pirates and privateers didn't sit around and go ""Arrr!"" all day like drunk old men. And when the captain of the Devon Belle speaks of the British Royal Navy, he gets everything wrong. I gave the book 3 stars because for somebody like me who knows a lot about ships and navies of the 1600s- 1800s, this book got everything wrong. Also, Jacques refers to flintlock pistols as ""muskets"", which is all wrong because I was getting the impression that people were tucking rifle- sized things into their belts. Otherwise a good book. First in the series was better, though."
3,"Good, but not excellent","My younger sister introduced me to this series about a week ago. The Castaways of the Flying Dutchman was great-it had everything. But when I picked up this book, I was a little bit disappointed. I really liked the first story in this book (extreme action, nautical setting, Ben's past coming back to haunt him...)but the second...What I didn't like was that the book lacked one important thing that all Redwall books, and this book's prequel have- a riddle. One of the reason that I love the Redwall books is because there is a riddle that the main characters have to solve.On the positive side, this book has really deep characters that have real personality. The setting and the plot are believable enough (until you meet the Razan's- then it's too far-out for me) and you can relate to (and sympathize with) the characters.Not as great as the first book, but if you really love the first book and are craving for more, go ahead and read it!"
2,WIre Rating and Size,"The insulation on this wire is misleading, the wire is actually around 6-8 gauge and can only handle about 1500 watts of current before starting to dim all your other electronics. The fuse holder is garbage, lasted me about 3 months before the elements got to it, I purchased a DB Link Fuse holder and that has gotten me much further. Don't bother buying this."
4,JA..... JA JA,"In Germany how do you say we have our superior technology, our superior culture. In Germany persons such as Ted Nugent are revered as gods. However this album plunged me into misery for lack of energy and brought about tremendous malaise. You see in Germany that is our highest pleasure. Therefore I award this CD the best German award of CD. We must support those who delight in violence and also dirt and filth. In West Berlin we with rim glasses of ridiculously cosmopolitan design do regard Nugent with derision which for us is affection, combined with humiliation which we also love."
3,Terrible Ted is just a typical white trash Detroiter with a guitar,"He plays loud, but he's nothing really impressive. I'm not a prude, but his attitude towards women is distasteful.He's no guitar legend. He's lucky to have gotten heard on FM rock radio in its heyday back in the mid to late seventies.""Stranglehold"" is probably his best rock radio staple. ""Wango Tango"" is probably the stupidest rock song ever recorded. I grew up in Detroit so hearing ""Motor City Madhouse"" was a constant local rock radio staple. And ""Cat Stratch Fever"" wouldn't go away either. Detroit played Ted Nugent probably more than other stations outside of Detroit because he was a Redford homeboy. Bob Seger was the more favored and respected Detroit-based rock influence.But again, I'll say, that he's loud, and crude, but he's no great legend. But, I'll admit though, that it is nice to have a remastered version of ""Stranglehold"". Without this song, he is easily forgettable."
4,10.5,"This is a great 2003 made for tv disaster movie.When a scientist (Kim Dalaney) and her assistant (David Cubbitt), try to warn the President (Beau Bridges), about a series of earthqukes in San Franscisco, LA, and California, he gets his friend, Lloyd Nolan, (Fred Ward), to head the FEMA team, to stop it...John Schneider, Kaley Cuoco, Ivan Sergei, and Dule Hill, give support to the cast.Co-writer/director John Lafia, (""Child's Play"", ""Man's Best Friend"", does a great job and the CGI effects are amazing....The ending sets up for the sequel ""10.5 Apocalyse""....Recommended.Four stars.Robert Helliger."
4,If Your Looking For Destruction...,"I personally enjoyed this somewhat long, but action filled movie. Being a fan of disaster films going all the way back to Earthquake and The Towering Inferno, I was surprised at how much I liked it.Sure, there's the know-it-all geologist and the last minute solution, but the ending is not as predictable as some other disater movies.I thought the drama, special effects and editing were above average. It your looking for destruction this movie might be for you."
3,"Not quite the stature of ""Volcano"" (1997)","Fake mountains and secondary actors produce the formula disaster movie. All disaster movies have the fun formula. Many try to get at least one know actor to hold it together; this movie has chosen Remo Williams (Fred Ward).Anyone notice the train is missing?Daddy, don't leave me!Where are the gas masks when you need them?A series of earthquakes kill stupid people and as they get more stupid the shocks get larger. Will the quakes stop in time or all the stupid people doomed?If you are watching this movie I suggest you stand in the door jam and hold on."
1,It's like a train wreck. Yet I cannot look away....,"So full of predictable characters & stupid dialogue, and chock full of so many scientific errors that even a dumb nuclear physicist like myself can spot and laugh at."
5,"Nice Bag, Man.",This is a very sturdy bag that feels durable. I will say it was a bit smaller than I thought but the dimensions were stated accurately. I just completely thought wrong on the size. Highly recommend if your looking to keep a quick grab and go bag on hand.
2,Disappointing image quality and out of sync,"I have to say that I expected more of this release. The image quality lacks detail to be (real) HD (as it was intended to be). Sound and vision are often out of sync. The concert is quite ok, so only 2 out of 5. Disappointing."
2,Not Worthy of Being on Blu-Ray,"Im juming straight and to point. I have a problem with this blu ray existing. The image quality is that of a standard DVD with a few snips filmed on HD (and even those seem to be upscaled). The video quality is sub par for a blu ray. I would have been much happier paying less and getting s standard DVD. After about 25 minutes of watching, I couldnt take it anymore. I turned off the tv and let the concert play through the surround sound. I enjoy Paramore in concert but this blu ray concert I wouldnt mind never seeing again."
1,Don't let the title fool you!,This is one of the worst Christmas movie I have ever seen and I have seen just about all of them.
4,Movie review,I liked the movie. The grand kids enjoyed the songs. Grand kids seemed to really enjoy the movie. I would recommmend.
3,Cute Christmas Story- But...,"There are more than a few questionable scenes that the more discerning parent will cringe at exposing their children to.Who writes this stuff? Elves using tazers on each other? So strange. Ultimately the kids enjoyed it, but this isn't destined to be a classicor even a favorite of the holiday movie collection- just one of those other ones to watch here and there."
3,Not Too Bad,This one is too light weight and not very impressive looking. It went together well and seems to hold up with not too much hanging on it.
5,Nice stand - great price,I will keep this simple. For the money I don't know how you could do better. looks exactly like the picture - comes in a box and you have to make some assembly of about 4 minutes. Simple construction and looks great.
1,"After only two days, one of the legs broke off.","Looks good. Seemed sturdy enough. But after two days, and only holding two light jackets and a couple of baseball caps, one of the legs broke from the stand. I am gluing it to see if it holds, but am not very happy with the overall quality. Would not recommend this product."
1,"A review by Regina V. Dudley, a reader of YEARS OF RAGE","Breathtakingly insufferable. Self-importance and satire are usually uncomfortable bedpartners on a page, but I can see how a literary project of this nature could make a fertile pairing of the two. Unfortunately, in this case, the one has become so bloated that the other has been rolled right off the bed; a (not necessarily very) observant reader will quickly discover what exactly it is I mean. As for the prose on offer in this jeremiad, there are moments that truly strain credulity with regard to their audacity. The problem is, we're talking more about the purse-snatcher kind of audacity rather than the Bret Easton Ellis kind of audacity. Other than that, it's OK."
3,Classic sweatshirt,"This sweatshirt runs VERY LARGE. I ordered women's size large. The order page shows a young woman wearing it, right? The shipping came 3 days early, which is fabulous. The sweatshirt is for an Amazon-sized woman. Instead of returning it, I altered the sleeves 4 inches. The length is amazing, fits way below my butt. OK for winter. Otherwise, it's a classic sweatshirt and meets my needs as I didn't want a hoodie or a little thingie,strappy number covering nothing. Beware, size large will fit your brother or husband."
3,The Best Man,"Greetings,I like the cd but was a little surprised it only came in the jacket and not the cd case/cover. So that made me a little unhappy but atleast I got the cd in the original cover.Peace!"
4,Underated,I just wish those who could actually relate to black films and music and know a little about different kinds of music genres and also black experience within this social construction of culture would be the ones who actually critiqued them. The Best Man was a very good movie and very emotionally charged. Help me to understand how this movie so routine.
1,Did some kid burn this these CDs from his bedroom?,There is no organization to these tutorials at all and they run very poorly. From the looks of the packinging (a jewel case with a crappy ink jet printed picture for an inside cover) I wouldn't doubt that this set was made by a complete amature. There are many other books and references out there that are much much better.
1,mislabeled!,"This site says the product is 15.1"", the actual packaging says it's 15.4"", but when I placed my 15.4"" notebook inside, there was a ton of extra room.It looks as if this sleeve is large enough for a 17"" laptop. Totally unacceptable."
3,Good Stuff,"Very entertaining. As far as quality goes, there's very little of it. But that's the point. I'm sure it's supposed to be a stupid, fake, extremely overdone movie. And if that's the case then the goal has been achieved. I liked it purely for how unnecessarily gory and fake it is. I found it quite humourous and got some evil laughs out of it."
1,RENT IT FIRST!!!!,"I should have just done that FIRST!!! No way would I have purchased it!!! However I went by way of some of the reviews. Not a good thing!! The movie had good production values however the acting was WEAK, and I was really hoping for MORE OVERALL. This film was talked about in a review I read a of the film ""Dead Alive"" which was WAY BETTER!!! If I were you rent it first before you consider purchasing it!!!!!"
4,...brutal!,"unrealistic...but thats the point.black comedy at its best! Kung-Fu, Gore, hilarious voice overs, awesome fight scenes.only way to describe this movie, BRUTAL AS HELL!!! watch this movie, then watch this movie and listen to Deicide...you will not be dissapointed!"
2,Meh.......bad acting but bloody and i guess kinda cult,"i buyed this movie cause i thought it was gory as hell! pffffft it was gory but only in a few scenes but opaqued with the awful plot and verry bad acting especially from the extras. it wasnt funny neither, riki oh was 24/7 drama queen and the subtitles.........totally different from the voice acting. english at least wasnt accurate with the english language. Seriously read the manga instead i myself liked it waaaayy more than the movie."
3,"Violent, Creative, action packed, yet Corny.","A definite hit with you action, blood and gore fans. But if you think your watching a good martial arts film, think again. it's nothing but celebrity death match with a story line. Talk about gross to, some of the special effects are great, but at other times you feel like your watching a 7th grade class project. If you gotta watch it, then it's ok, but i don't believe this is a great. by no means."
4,Riki-Oh is funny stuff,"Riki-Oh starts stupid and looks like a mystery science theater movie, but it quickly improves the moment blood begins shooting all over. it may seem gross, but it is impossible to take in context and will have you laughing at dismemberment and disembowelment like you've never laughed at dismemeberment and disembowelment before. and its twice and funny since its dubbed in crappy voices, and he is portrayed as a nice person."
5,"The most visceral, gut-busting film made in film history!!!!","This has to be the most amazing film I have ever seen in my life!!! I first saw it several years ago on the big screen and it blew me out the back of the theatre!!!! That it is now readily available on video is a source of celebration for me!!! Anyone who enjoys violent, trashy, action-packed viscera of the Hong Kong variety, should own this awsome powerhouse of a film. It leaves an indelible mark on the viewer which leaves you talk ing about it for years (sometimes to the detriment of your sanity!!!!) Forget Jackie Chan, Chow Yun Fat and the rest of their buddies... this is the ULTIMATE HongKong action adventure!!! The Eastern equivialent to Peter Jackson's BrainDead, except much MUCH gorier!!!"
3,Weaker than the rest of the series...,"More than once I've heard folks talk about God Bless John Wayne as one of the better Kinky entries, but I'm just not convinced. Everything from the premise to the by-the-books sleuthing seems both contrived and hurried.For those not in the know, Kinky Friedman's fictional self is a wonderfully Texan detective living in NYC with his cat and a Sherlock Holmes head where he keeps his cigars. His dysfunctional drinking pals often need his advice/help...and here, Ratso needs Kinky to find his mother for him. After a little help and a few dead ends (the Kinkster in Florida?) we're off and running.As usual the high points here are Kinky's many asides about music, drugs, women, coffee, Jesus, etc., and while he has never been better in the wit department I'm afraid that we've lost much of the charm of the storylines from earlier volumes. It's not so bad as to make me quit reading, but I just don't see this one as a stand-out."
3,OK Pans,"I don't dislike like but I don't fully like them. I have Wiltons Recipe Right Angel Food Cake pan, found elsewhere, which is made from the same material and it makes the mose beautiful angel food cakes. This however lacks when making muffins. I was not thrilled when my muffins came out of the oven. They were browned on the bottom and very light on the top. They needed more time to cook as the tops were still wet while the bottoms were done. Would have preffered for wilton to make aluminum junbo muffin pans in the fashion of their regular size muffin pans circa 1990's. My mother has those pans and we are never dissapointed. These pans leave something to be desired."
4,pretty good recent live recordings.............,"I've always been a fan of the Motels, especially the early sounds, TotalControl, Danger, Celia, Misson of Mercy etc. and many of these are featured on this collection. Its pretty obvious that Martha Davis stillhas some pipes on her and she isn't trying to kill these older gems and hitswith overkill, she still has a big rock heart to her delivery, somethingI always knew was there even when the record company tried so hard tomake her a pop sex kitten I knew under all that was a big voiced styliststill making great rock music(can't wait for her new stuff to arrive, I heardmany new tracks both acoustic and from her fourth coming ""beautiful life""and its powerful stuff, more commerical than her last solo effort butevery bit as vital, she needs to get out and get her stuff to her fans."
5,One Of The Best Live Albums In Years!,"If you are a fan of the Clash, From Here To Eternity Live is an essential piece. The Clash were an incredible live band, and this album captures the entire experience of the greatest punk group of all time live. This album contains some of the Clash's all time best songs live. Some of the best songs on the album are Complete Control, London's Burning, White Man in Hammersmith Palais, London Calling, The Magnificent Seven and Should I Stay Or Should I Go. The two best songs on the album, however, are Train in Vain and Guns Of Brixton. Both of these songs are done incredibly good. They are possibly better than the album versions, which are bothe incredible, also. As I said before, this album is a must have for fans of the Clash."
3,We Didn't Start the Fire,"The reason Rolling Stone leaves out artists like Billy Joel, Three Dog Night and Bob Seagar is because they are nowhere near the top echelon of rock and roll artists. The reason they heap praise on the Rolling Stones is because the Rolling Stones are the greatest rock band in the history of the genre. And the reason the Beatles get two chapters is because no other artist has had as much impact on rock and roll music as the Beatles. Get real, people!"
3,Beading,There were some pages that were actual duplicate beading examples. Otherwise the book is okay. I use this book to get started on ideas. Still on the lookout for the right beading book for me.
4,helpful ideas,I've been designing jewelry for a little over a year and was looking for some fresh ideas and inspiration. This book provided both...
1,Ugh!!!! Another useless Health o meter!,"This is my second scale from Health o meter. I would not have purchase a second one, but my hubby purchased it when I asked him to get a scale at Walmart...should have told him NOT to get this brand again. Our first one (a different model) was from a family member and it was fairly new when I got it. It just stopped working for no reason after less than a year of use. It looked almost brand new still. I felt horrible throwing it away...what a waste. Now with this model the SAME thing happened. About 18 months after purchasing it is now just not turning on. I even wasted additional money buying new batteries (which is a waste because it uses a special lithium battery that I can't use on anything else). I am staying clear of this crappy brand!!! The landfills are probably full of sleek new looking scales made by Health o meter."
1,Really bad!,"i tried this scale both in the bathroom (ceramic tiles) and in the kitchen (hardwood flooring) literally over 30 times. i got a range of weights between 184.3 and 112.8! (in reality i weigh about 123 lbs) i never got the same number twice in a row, every single time it was something different. and even getting the scale to calibrate is a huge chore. i will be returning this thing immediately. i have never been so disappointed in a scale before."
4,Digital Scales,"Like that it does pounds or kilos at the flick of a switch underneath. Stylish looking, just don't spill wax on the silver part. Haven't read the manual or figured out the fancy features yet, just use for weigh monitoring."
3,Broke but Amazon customer service is great,"This scale started to have conflict readings after only 1 month: i have 3 different weights in one minute!But good thing is, Amazon has AMAZING customer service. After my complaint, they sent me a new one. The new one has been doing a pretty good job so far, still different readings but if I step on it continually couple times there will be only 2 results: I just go with the more frequent one."
3,Good value in a functional scale,"The scale is attractive and light. It's a little disconcerting to have to ""tap"" it to turn it on and calibrate it but you get used to this necessity. It's nice to have the tenth-of-a-pound display. Reproducibility is adequate."
3,Not very accurate,"it looks nice and it's lightweight. However, it's not the most accurate...I'll go to weigh myself and it'll read 177.5 then i go to weigh myself again right after i just stepped off and it reads 181.2... it doesn't always do this but it does it more often than it should. i've never really trusted digital scales but it was a matter of durability and price on this one. either spend more money on a better scale or get one with the little dial that teeters a bit more accurately... fatty!"
4,Good value,"It's a great value and clearly works well. It's not as heavy or sturdy feeling as I was expecting, but it doesn't seem to be cheap or flimsy. I'm generally pleased with it even when I'm not pleased with what it tells me!"
1,not what I had expected,"I had such high hopes for this scale. I was convinced the scale I owned already (different brand) was no longer working as if you weighed yourself 5 times in a row on it you got 5 different readings so I purchased this new health o meter one.However after unpacking it, testing it by weighing myself it seemed to work. I then decided to put a gym weight on this one and my old one to really test it's accuracy. My old one was correct and this health o meter was way wrong - it said 5.2lbs when the weight was 10lbs.I think it could be a design issue. The platform you stand on is curved - perhaps to match your foots curve, I really don't know. But I do think this makes it difficult to stand with weight evenly distributed on the platform.I have now moved my old scale to another room and it works fine so the health o meter is now relgated to the corner to collect dust."
2,"Inacccurate, prone to getting dirty, and just impossible for large feet.","I have owned this scale for a few months and I'm buying another one. First, it's impossible to clean between the glass plate and the metal, and it's rather gross. Second, I have never had the same reading in a row ever, it's impossible to figure out where to put your feet especially since the curve will not accommodate the arch of very large feet like mine. Third, it takes forever to start once you tap it and it shuts off quickly once it flashes. I would recommend investing in a good scale."
1,Inaccurate,"I got this in the mail, and the first time I stepped on it, it weighed me higher than my other scale. The second time, lower, and the third, fourth, and fifth weighs were all different as well. I'm sending this back, because it's obviously not accurate. The construction is shoddy, and the gray surface isn't level. When you step on, it creaks and gives a little, which is probably why it's inaccurate."
3,Didn't pay much for it. Didn't expect too much.,The display is clear and can be easily read. The accuracy is OK if you are willing to accept a variance of 1 to 2 pounds between readings. Must weigh yourself 4 or 5 times and average the readings. Not consistent enough.
5,"My Favorite ""Conard County"" so far","Although I've yet to find a complete list,this book set me to trying to collect the entire series. I'm surprised no one has come up with a ""listmania"" list. I just ordrered ""Destination Conard County"" in hopes it may be the last so I can get a list of what I'm still missing.My only complaint with this book was that it hinted at problems between Nate and Marge Tate who seem to be recurring characters throughout the series, but never gives any explanation or resolution. Since the heroine of this book was their eldest daughter, and it appears another daughter will star in ""Destination"",perhaps that plot line will get picked back up. If so, then I hope it is'nt the last book. I'd love to see more featuring ""Cowboy"" and some of Yuma's other friends and lost warriors from this book.Oh yeah, it was pretty cool having a tough guy hero named Billie Joe."
3,From Back Cover,"Being shot was only the start of his bad luck.Mark Kincaid had two very good reasons for coming to the small Texas town of Aransas City--to renovate the dilapidated house he'd inherited from his uncle and to recover from the gunshot wound he'd received while working undercover. Being attracted to Cat Randolph wasn't on his list.Of course, that was before he discovered that the smuggling ring he'd been trying to bust had operations in his new hometown. And that Cat's brother was a suspect. Getting to know his neighbor might be the kind of trouble he liked."
3,Interesting until the end..,"I love Patterson's books particularly because they're easy to read and easy to get through quickly. His stories are usually very well-constructed but I thought this one lacked something in the end. Throughout the whole book, you go through several murders, intriguing situations between the main characters and tidbits of side stories. Then at the end, he seems to run out of steam and doesn't tie things together very well. I was disappointed. But the rest of the book made up for it. I'm just kinda left wondering exactly how it all went together."
1,disappointment,"honeymoon was a disappointment due to the quailtity of cd""s very poor. was the propeerty of a library it was suppose to be good conditionthe story was great what i could listen to"
3,Gotta love those 'black widows',"I am a big Patterson fan, and have read most of his books. This book is a great read ... one you find difficult to put down. Read it in three days and I actually stayed up late the last night to finish it. Unfortunately the ending, which for me was chapters 114 & 115, are a letdown. I don't want to give away the ending, but if you read it carefully, there are just too many unanswered questions. I'm afraid my imagination just doesn't stretch far enough to follow the sequence of events the reader is supposed to believe. Sorry Patterson. With a different, more plausible ending, this book would have been five stars."
2,First half good; forgettable 2nd half,This is the first time i have read this author. I thought I had picked up something by Richard North Patterson and wondered how it could be so bad. I won't be reading this author again. I guessed every plot twist and mystery in the story. The ending was very quick and unsatisfactory -- as if the author simply gave up on the story.
4,Read this on my honeymoon...,"and I thought it was great. A diversion from the grisly world of Alex Cross but a great story none-the-less. It wasn't as dark as some of his other works but it still had an edge that keeps the pages turning. I thought all of the character's were well done and as a newly wed male I found the Black Widow angle to be particularly frightening. Especially considering the intelligence and ruthlessness of this woman and the power a beautiful woman can wield over all of the men around her. Anyways, I couldn't put it down and I would definitely recommend it..."
1,Definitely 'junk food' reading!,"There's nothing new interesting or worthwhile about 'Honeymoon'. Die-hard Patterson fans will probably like it, but others should wait for the next Alex Cross or 'Murder Club' entry. This is mostly a lightweight soap opera."
2,It is unrealistc. The charctors are shallow and there is no developemant of the characters,"It is unrealistc It is unrealistc. The charactors are shallow and there is no developemant of the characters, It is a too perfect world"
3,Just Okay...Not one of his Best,"One of the main problems I have with James Patterson is his writing of women characters. This is why I am also not a fan of his First to Die Series. His characterization of the main character, Nora, is flat and unbelievable, with her motivations barely touched on. Nora has a group of girlfriends, that know about her deceased physican husband and her new boyfriend, but know nothing of her secret life with her new husband. The interactions between these women is forced and not realistic. The Alex Delaware series is much more developed with James Patterson clearly in his element. I have enjoyed those books much more."
2,Honeymoon Ends in Divorce,"Is James Patterson losing his ability to write a novel? Is that why he had ""help"" on this one? If so, the ""help"" didn't do him any favors. This book was awful. It was juvenile. It jumped from character to character without much chohesiveness. It was just a really bad book. Save your money and get it from the library."
1,Have I read the same book?,"I am a big fan of James Patterson. I enjoyed his Alex Cross novels and the Women's Murder Club series I have also enjoyed most of his other novels. The short, sharp chapters just pull me right in. I've been reading a lot of different authors lately but decided it was time to catch up in all the ones I'd missed. I was sorely disappointed with this book, I wish I could've gave it a zero. Sorry Mr Patterson, maybe next time."
3,Honeymoon - Rather Disappointing...,"This was my first James Patterson novel. I expected so much more....It would have been more interesting if John O'Hara had fallen madly in love with Nora, and their relationship had gone much further, hence, the revelation of Nora's softer side, actually falling in love with someone.It would have been nice to know what the letter from Nora to her mom revealed.The ending should have been more explosive...Why did Nora have to die? To be honest, the last few chapters were quite predictable."
3,It just ended...,"The book was ok, not one of patterson's best (I have read all most all). The end was going pretty good and then it just ended like he got tired of writting."
4,Sexy Murder Mystery Thriller,"This is one of those books that hooks the reader from the beginning and then proceeds to drag him through short, action-packed chapters that eventually end up with the good guys coming out on top. While predictable at times, this is a decent and quick read. Nora, the sexy and smart main character has a thing for good looking guys with money, as well as taking their money after she kills them (I won't tell you how). Once the FBI catches on, the race and the romance begins. Approach this book with the same expectations you would any other fast-paced thriller and you'll enjoy this book without being disappointed."
1,My first and last James Patterson,"As this author has been recommended to me by friends, I thought I would read his latest, the ""2005 International Thriller of the Year."" I have only read to page 34, but won't waste my time reading another word of this book. It is boring and trite. And, I am so turned off by authors (or publishers) who waste so much space with starting a new chapter half way done the page. Page 34 is already in chapter 9. Some chapters are only two pages. There are too many good books waiting to be read to waste another minute with Honeymoon."
3,"Trashy thriller, but still an amusing read.","I would best have to describe this book as a trashy thriller. It doesn't start out as such but quickly evolves into an ongoing description of the sordid affairs of the main characters. None the less, the book was still an amusing and quick read. If that is what you are looking for then you'll be satisfied."
1,disappointing,reads like a movie script and not a well-fleshed novel. No thrill as it was predictable. The authors answer any red herring as soon as they are presented. i was disappinted yet again in Patterson's association with this work.
4,"Vintage Patterson, better writing w/ this co-author","For all Patterson fans, this co-author, Roughan, provides better writing than deYoung a previous collaborator. Book is a page burner. New character, O'Hara, a Fibbie, is undercover and so has an alter-identity (and a story within a story) as an insurance investigator looking for clues for the deaths of all these dot.com-type rich guys who are dieing of heart attacks, soon after marrying the same black widow, who accumulates quite a few victims as well as their cash which she effortlessly transferrs to her Cayman Is. account."
1,Superficial Hogwash,"The characters are superficial, the plot is nearly non-existant and the subplot is an afterthought. What was Patterson thinking when he slapped his name on this book? I remain firmly convinced that sans his name, the only award this book would've gotten is ""2005 International Bore of the Year"", if it had made it to press that is. It really is that bad. If you must read it yourself, check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend who was simularly suckered into buying it. You're better off burning your money than buying this book."
1,What dreck!,"I should have known. I was warned. But I picked it up anyway. This piece of garbage would have been rejected by ""True Confessions"" magazine back in the '50s. Who on earth buys Patterson's books and allows him to go on perpetrating this pablum on the public? Minus stars."
1,"DULL, PREDICTABLE, UNINSPIRED","All hype, no substance. This insipid book lacks everything that makes a book supreme ... character development, complexity, imagination, plot. Not only is this a waste of time and money, the book totally devalues the credibility of the ""2005 International Thriller of the Year"" award. Wait, it's only April, right??If you have an uncontrollable desire to read this, wait for a used copy in paperback."
2,Still in decline,"Based on the hype, I expected so much more--like another Beach House, or vintage Alex Croft! The plot is both derivative and unbelievable. The characters barely escaped being stereotypical and were poorly motivated. The suspense is contrived, with the ""tourist"" scenes falling to the level of literary cheating. Knowing what Patterson at his best can do, I was very disappointed. Because of the last 3 or 4 books, I won't spend time with Patterson again unless he manages another cowrite with Peter DeJonge. Fans would be well served if Patterson and his publisher backed off on the publishing schedule and focused more on quality."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"If this book is the International Thriller of the Year, I think we are all in trouble. Patterson just keeps getting worse. I thought I'd learned my lesson a few books ago (Beach House?), but I let myself be drawn into reading this. The story is shallow and very familiar and predictable, the characters are mostly superficial, and the whole work could've been printed in half the length, were it not for heavy paper and 3-page ""chapters."" I felt like the victim of a scam. Patterson and his publisher are making fools of us. I guarantee that novels such as this would receive uniformly scathing reviews were it not for his name - and apparently a very effective marketing ploy."
2,A Good Idea Wasted!,"The anime Goku is sadly yet another title to add to the ultra violent, guilty pleasure anime bin. I thought the concept of a detective being given an artifical eye that can control every computer in the world to be interesting. Yet my interest faded with the weak plot and paper thin characters. If you enjoyed anime titles such as Golgo 13 you might enjoy this, everyone else save your time for a better Anime such as Patlabor 2, Princess Mononoke or Ghost in the Shell."
2,Demystifyng the devil video isn't that great!,"I own this video and it's mostly old band members and ex girlfriends bashing him and the rest of the band. I do not advise true fans to buys this because it's unauthorized and it just doesn't have that much info that isn't already know from his book that he wrote himself. In my opinion, I say don't bother with this video, read his book if you want info about the band."
1,Disappointing,"I am a fan of Marilyn Manson and really like watching music DVDs, but this one wasn't good. No music, or even videos, just kicked out band members doing a lot of whining. Don't bother with this one."
2,Not Demystifying Me,"Marilyn Manson is a human being, just like you and I. Except, what sometimes, no.....Not sometimes. What ALWAYS bothers people is that he sing in an anti-Jesus point of view. I'm not the only Christian that likes him. My friends, my enemies too. We all like his music. I don't agree with him, as a person, but his music is an amazing spectacle of lights, sound, and other things. God Bles the King, Mr. Manson!! Don't buy this video! It's not the right thing. They describe Brian Warner as Marilyn Manson, and Marilyn Manson, ONLY!!"
1,Manson Stinks.,Most overated sensation driven non-talented musical hack of our generation. Stay away....
5,I LOVE Tad Williams,"I bought the first of his Otherland series I believe two years ago.. and went through them as fast as you'd go through picture books. They are the most incredibly thought provoking, fantastical, and ingenious books that I have ever read.This last book is no different. Even after finishing it nearly a year ago, the story, characters and incredible twists and turns are avidly preserved in my mind. To not experience his creativity and expertise by buying these books is a shame.I can't wait for the fourth book!"
3,Too Dense Tad,Reading this series requires intellectual stamina due to the complex plot and disorientation associated with the intertwining of reality and virtual reality. I'm hooked but frustrated - in my opinion it takes the author too long to get to the good parts where there is some serious action.
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!,"There is nothing good about this movie! This is one of the worst movies I saw in my life, it is so imaginative but it has a bit of action.Take my advice this movie sucks!!!"
1,Don't get it if your doing serious woodworking,"The saw is fine for small jobs for flooring and such. Not any serious woodworking or load. I used mine for ripping stretcher bars for canvases. I take a Kiln Dried 2x4 and rip it at a 35 degree angle. Well the first Hitachi lasted a month and I returned it for another one at Lowe's, the assumption being that saw was faulty. The replacement has just burnt out on me two years down the road. I'm shopping for something better, just thought I'd post a warning."
1,this thing stinks on ice dont buy,"I was foolish enough to purchase this saw because I always thought Hitachi made good products, guess again. The so called riving knive never lines up with the blade creating a potential scary kickback and couple that with the cheapest fence system I have ever seen, workpieces get jammed up in the middle of a cut. The throat plate is a disaster as well it is almost impossible to get the plate flush with the top which will throw off your square at the end of a cut. DO NOT BUY, buy a Delta or a Jet and save your sanity and money."
3,Great Fun....for Rutger Hauer fans!,"This movie is great fun and worth your time if you're a fan of the man, Rutger Hauer. As far as story, continuity etc. It really doesn't offer much.For Fans Only!!"
1,this is a very naughty film,"this film has been very naughty and deserves to have its pants pulled down and its bottom smacked and then be sent to bed for a week with no supper. it presents us with two mismatched cops divided by age. rutger hauer loves his daughter dearly but simply never sees her because he loves her so much. his young sassy computer literate partner talks him into giving the old e-mail interweb thingy a go. i think he likes his new partner better than his daughter and wants to have his daughter replaced. and as for you andrew mccarthy, you said you'd never let me down. to be fair up until now you never have let me down, but now you have let me down. you must go to your bed and stay there for a week also. the end."
5,I couldn't live without it!,It really was everything I needed to know! An essential resource with a wonderful perspective on parenting.
1,AWFUL unless you are doing attachment pareting,"This was used during my first child, unless you are doing attachment style parenting then DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!! It tells you to carry your baby in a sling 24/7 and to sleep with the baby in your bed - not alwasys safe!! It also makes you feel like crap if you don't breast feed which I did but it is NOT a good book at all!!"
1,Attachment parenting...don't do it!,"Don't do it! Get a different book. I studied many of his books, agreed wholeheartedly with attachment parenting, and raised my baby since birth using his methods. And I'm telling you attachment parenting is not a good thing! Our child is now two, and for a while now we've been trying to reverse everything we learned from Sears. Our toddler is very strong-willed and I'm afraid we spoiled him with AP. AP does not set enough boundaries and that's what children need. Please read the other 1 star comments as I don't feel the need to recap what's already been said. I just wanted to enter in another 1 star. Am very concerned how popular this book is on Amazon....which was the reason why I bought it in the first place. Beware of Sears!"
4,Attachment Parenting 101,"This is a wonderful book for parents, particularly mothers,who plan to do nothing else but tend to their baby 24/7 for the first two years of life. It is a great resource and full of medical information that is both helpful and reassuring. The only drawback to this book is the authors' opinions--which may make you like an inferior mom if you give up breastfeeding before one year, go back to work, and do not sleep with your baby. All of the chapters in this book really reinforce attachement parenting. It is a nice concept, if you can do it, but if you can't, you might find this book a frustrating and guilt-inducing read! For those who don't practice this type of parenting I recommend Dr. Spock!"
5,informative,"I bought this for my son and his wife, who just had their first baby two weeks ago. I have not read it myself, but they have told me repeatedly how they love this book, and are always reading it and learning why their new daughter does some of the things she does, and what is normal, etc. It appears to be a very useful book, and very thorough."
5,Very useful,"This book is practical as a reference and easy to understand. A lot of its information is within the context of the attachment style, which I didn't really know much about until I read the book. I had not researched the various ""styles"" of parenting before our daughter was born, but after reading this book, I realized that my husband and I were already doing most of what Dr. Sears discussed. We found it to be very helpful to us."
5,"It has become our baby bible, an excellent reference book",For new parents this is an excellent comprehensive guide to what to expect and how to deal with the unforeseen and unexpected. It is clear and concise. The authors are objective and do not put down mothers who might not be able to give themselves 100% to their babies. This is perhaps the best investment we made before Oliver's birth.
4,Good reference,"I am by no means an ""earthy-crunchy"" type (did not exclusively breast feed, no co-sleeping, used a sling but not all the time, etc.), but I think this book IS a good reference source. Take it for what it is worth and consider the fact that this is not the end-all, be-all of information. Some of the things stated may seem a bit extreme (my advice: then skip it), but there seems to be that type of thing in almost all baby books that lean in one direction or the other.If you buy this book, I would strongly suggest using it as a reference source and taking only the things that seem significant to you that are presented here and using them."
2,Too much fear-mongering,"I'm about to give birth and have been looking for a helpful, unbiased resource that presents several different approaches to the first few months with a newborn. The Sears book does have some useful factual information, but the sections on attachment parenting are so sanctimonious and self-righteous. I can't stand the way they insert anectdotes about people who didn't practice attachment parenting and ended up with broken family bonds, angry children, etc. I think I am open to the ideas behind attachment parenting, but this book turned me off so much that I am already exploring alternatives."
5,"Great book, very informative","This is a great book. Dr Sears covers topics from breastfeeding, feeding babies food, baby wearing, vaccines and co sleeping (all things I had questions and concerns about). I wish I bought this to read when I was pregnant. I would say that many parents would get lots of good information from this book. I continue to reference it and our son is 10 months old. It has a permanent spot on my bookshelf!"
3,Thorough,"This is ONE theory on parenting, and overall a good one in my opinion. Attatchment parenting is outlined very completely in this book, however, which lends itself to literalism. If you know your mind and have your own intrinsic view of parenting, this book is a nice complement.As to some reports of this parenting theory causing divorce and other marital discord, I doubt that. If a book can overpower a relationship, there must be pre-existing issues. If you would be susceptable to neglecting your marriage because ""the book says..."" then you should be thinking about that instead of looking for the difinitive authority on parenting.Also look at ""Your Baby and Child"" by Penelope Leach. GREAT book there."
2,"Should Be Titled ""Attachment Parenting, Birth to 2 Yrs""","I bought this book online before the birth of our first daughter based on the fact that it is the bestselling book on the subject. I did not read the reviews other than the average of four stars. The Baby Book has good information on health issues, as you would expect from any baby book. What I did not know is the the Sears family are huge proponents of attachment parenting. Attachment parenting probably works and produces well-adjusted kids but is very impractical unless you don't have to work or have maids, gardeners and nannies, etc. to keep your house from falling down around you. Nobody can carry a baby around 24 hours a day while maintaining a healthy marriage and getting the day-to-day things done that need to get done."
2,Guilt Complex,"Although this book has some good facts, it is really not worth the money. If you are not already Catholic, you will feel just as guilty by the time you finish this book. The Sears' are self-righteous, ultra-traditional and inflexible in their judgment. They criticize other books for their inflexible methods, but are equally so themselves. They rely heavily on their own parenting experiences and communicate that their parenting methods are the only way. They suggest that anyone not following their methods are insensitive, unloving people.If a parent were to follow their guidelines, they would not have time to even do their laundry, let alone go to work! Also, your baby would never: 1) sleep in his/her own room; 2) sleep throught the night; 3) be put down; 4) behave independently."
4,Useful but repetitive,"I enjoyed this book and found it more thorough than a lot of other baby books. It also makes a great reference guide. I keep it and refer back to it often. I like the sections detailing baby's development by month.I only have one criticism. I understood the Sears' theories on breastfeeding, wearing your child in a sling and also co-sleeping. With that said, I found those 3 points of the book to be a little overdone and also very repetitive. I felt like they were being reiterated constantly through out the book and since I really got it the first time, I felt this repetition to be a little annoying and maybe the space used to cover those topics ad nauseum could have been used more productively."
1,Potentially DEADLY advice,"I used Dr.Sears book as my baby bible with my son and was happy and perhaps even smug about adhering to the attachment parenting principles. However the concept was a fatal mistake for my second child. Our daughter Corynn died in our bed, suffocated next to me. Bedsharing is dangerous. I am not overweight and I was not under the influence of drugs. I followed all their ""safe"" guidelines.I even wrote to the author over 6 months ago to let them know and have yet to hear a reply.Please look at all ""popular"" advise with a jaundiced eye.The information in this book is potentially negligent."
1,Worst Baby Book EVER - Dont waste $ on it if adopting....,I bought this book a year ago in preparation for the adoption of our daughter from China. This is the absolute worst baby book I have ever seen. At least 1/2 of it focuses on breast feeding and makes you feel like an absolute criminal if you don't breast feed. I am surprised the authors aren't advocating a constitutional amendment requiring all mothers to breast feed! Complete waste of money. No practical advice in this book at all. I highly recommend Dr. Spock's book or Baby 411 instead!!!
2,british version not american,i was confused by the british terminology.nappies are diapers. dummies are pacifiers. i would not recommend this book to americans. amazon should have specified that the book was a british version. im not sure if there is an american version. if so make sure that is what you get.overall pretty disappointed.
2,Returned it!,"I've heard a lot about this book and bought it eagerly. While the medical advice may be sound (I don't know enough to tell), the parenting advice and tone was so judgemental and annoying that I sent it right back. They advocate that parents should sleep with the baby (and consider not buying a crib), insist on going through labor in a warm tub and demand that the baby stay in-room at the hospital--all to develop an attachment with the child. These techniques may have worked well for them, and other parents, but the tone of ""do this or fail at parenting"" I found preachy and none too useful."
2,Attachment parenting didn't work for me,I followed the advise in this book for my first baby and I was completely exhausted and depressed. I'm using the Baby Whisperer's book with my second baby and it's so much easier getting this baby to sleep.
5,Truly everything you need to know,I couldn't have done it w/out this book. I purchase this book for every friend who is becoming a first time parent. You will use this book everyday.
4,Very heavy book.,"It is a very good book, but it is too heavy. I can't hold it while nursing my baby. :)"
1,Inaccurate and irresponsible,"As a neurologist, I am appalled by the medical inaccuracies in this book and by how out of date even the most basic recommendations are. Using sheets and blankets in a crib is just the most basic example of how woefully incompetent these writers are. They should have their medical licenses yanked and their children removed to foster care.As a working woman, I am also dismayed. This book could be subtitled, ""How to be a slave to your baby."" In it we learn that mothers should stay at home and cloth diapers with pins are the the way to go. It is misogynistic and painful to read.Bottom line: If you want to bring a MRSA infection home to your baby, this is the book for you."
5,Toss What to Expect in the Trash!,"After reading What to Expect When You're Expecting and feeling frustrated and guilty when their advice didn't seem to be working and just didn't feel right to me, I picked up The Baby Book while browsing in the bookstore. Eureka!!! I found that this book met me exactly where I was and validated that the way my heart was telling me to raise my son was right on target!! Guilt and fear lifted off my shoulders, I tossed What to Expect in the trash! So much of the advice in these two books is on opposite ends of the spectrum. But Dr. Sears' book is supported by YEARS of sound scientific studies that are not just promoted in his book. The AAP just recently endorsed co-sleeping with infants a few weeks ago! It is too bad that What to Expect's advice on baby slings, grazing and crying it out is so outdated and misinformed. The BABY BOOK is all you'll ever need!!"
4,"Good book, yet somewhat essentialistic and Western-centered","I am a queer woman hoping to become a parent soon. This book is very helpful for learning more about babies and their needs. I enjoyed reading it and feel more prepared to becoming a parent. Yet it felt alienating to have too many 'he' for baby in the book and there are very few references for single parents. As a feminist I also felt somewhat uncomfortable with discussions of ""natural"" connection between baby and mom."
3,"A bit lenghty, but has good info.","I got burned out reading this book because there is so much stuff in it. However, I think it's a great book to have on hand as a resource to read the sections your child is in at that time. Not a book that is good to sit down and try to finish."
2,Presents one-sided view of childrearing,"This book is titled ""The Baby Book."" Thus one may think that it's just another one of the many books that contain standard baby care information. But it's really about attachment parenting. The book advocates breastfeeding, cloth diapers, baby slings and co-sleeping. The advice about putting babies to sleep is opposite all the advice I've seen in other books.Every parent must make their own decision of course. If you want a book about attachment parenting, this is probably a good one. If you want a mainstream baby book, this isn't it."
5,"A very, ahem, ""filling"" read.","The combination of good sex, good food, and good relationships in this book is totally satisfying. I loved the main male character Dante as he is one of those rare men who understands how to see a woman as his equal, and how to still be a strong masculine leader for her. Loved it and left me wanting to read more of her books. The recipes are a bonus. Someday I will actually try to make some of them myself."
4,Yummy book,"Aside from mouthwatering recipies for wonderous sounding Itallian food, the book is great too! The plot is good, the characters are alive and the story flows. In comparison to the first book, I though the first book was better. But that does not mean this was not a good story. It was a great story. I want a Dante for myself."
4,It Is About Design,"This book offers some basic stitch directions. Mostly however, this book is about creativity and design. This book includes patterns for most of the illustrations presented in the book."
4,Peyote Stitch:Beading Projects,This has been a very informative book. It's designs and patterns entertain both beginners and more advanced peyote stitchers. I highly recommend this book to all.Lovely pictures and a easy to understand directions. I do wish that some of the extra pictures had directions but once one understands the basics its a go and try it from there.Kimberley Neff
5,LOOOOOVE IT!!!,"I just bought this for my kiddos and WE love it. As far as coloring goes and getting food or what not off the surface it really doesnt seem like a big deal to me. The groves arent so deep that you cant clean it off. Besides if the child is coloring from a coloring book i dont see an issue. Even if it where one page there are always ways....**rolls eyes at other comment**The umbrella is an awesome size, i thought it was going to be the really small cheap fabric flimsy kind...its really good quality."
2,"Not as ""advanced"" as one may think.","Was it bad, no, and it's probably worth your time and money to buy, because there are some great tips, ideas, and perspectives in it. I must tell you, though, that it's not as if she letting any cats out of the bag, as it were. She says in the beginning that she's not going to explain basic techniques or go into the things that an experienced Wiccan should already know, but she DOES, a lot. I found a few times she'll tell you about different advanced techniques, but doesn't actually tell you how to do them or give you any instruction. I've never been a big fan of her writing style, but this seems to be a little better than other works. At least she doesn't make up too much history in this."
1,Waste of money,"""Hooray!"" thinks the reader. ""Finally something written beyond the ""Witchcraft 101"" level!""I am sorry to disappoint the reader, but ""Advanced Witchcraft"" isn't.There is very little of actual worth in this book. Most of it has nothing to do with witchcraft at all and is more like the watered-down Neo-Wicca that gets churned out by authors all too often these days.You would think, then, that changing the title to ""Advanced Wicca"" might make the content within more relevant. Alas no. There's nothing advanced here. The book is basically a list of requirements the author believes necessary to define oneself as an ""advanced witch"". As very few of these requirements have much to do with witchcraft, and as few of them are particularly advanced, one can only imagine that McCoy wrote this book so that she could refer to herself as an advanced witch.Save your money."
2,Cheaply Made,"This item is obviously cheaply made, but I should have known that by the price. The CD player stopped working after one week. The radio isn't digital, so reception and accuracy can be very difficult."
1,My 4 cats HATE these!,"I have 4 finicky cats. One inny, and 3 outies.I have to feed them a different flavor of food each night or they will turn their noses up at dinner.So I have tried these 4 different times now, knowing my furry kids are picky little things.Offered them Solo- They ignored them and walked away.On the side of their wet food, they ignored them and left them in the dish.Crumbled ON the food- They ate around them.Mixed IN the food- They ALL went without breakfast today. Everyone one of them walked away from the dish, swishing tails.Okay, I'm done torturing my cats.They just don't like them.Cats! What r u gonna do?And this is just my experience.I'm gad I got them here at Amazon though. Price + shipping was good, compared to WE's website, so I'm out a lot less."
5,Best MP4 player,This is the best MP4 player I've ever owned. I've had mine since 2006 and it never gave me problems. I am surprised how low the ratings are when this product is clearly great. I love this small pocket size MP4...it's also very loud. I've dropped mine many times and it hasn't broken or cracked. Wonderful Centon Mp4 player.
5,Levi's Men's Cargo Pants,"Great product. I have cargo pants that I paid twice as much as these and I like the levi's as well or better. If they were offered in more colors, I would buy more. I have two pairs in both colors. I recommend these pants without reservation. They run a little large, which is fine with me."
5,Cargo Pants Stone Color,Perfect Fit no sizing issues - Bought a 32 X 30 and got what I expected - Quick delivery and top quality. Good Value. I like all the pockets available - especially for those times you need to move your wallet for long drives or air travel. How about a hemp version Levi?
5,One of the Best,"I have been a student of Dr. Richards for five years, and this is by far the best work he has done on the subject of convict sociology and the norms of convict life. His work is sociologically precise and he writes in the very real and now of the state of convict life with true to life language. I would recommend this book to anyone with a sociological interest in corrections or criminology."
4,WW2 Memoir by a Goon,"A continuation of the biography that started with ""Adolf Hitler; my part in his downfall"". Spike Milligan brings his sense of the ridiculous to the very serious business of war and his personal experience as a gunner in the British army in the Middle East.At times hilarious, occasionally tragic, the book portrays ordinary men doing their bit for the war effort.Spike Milligan's sense of humor permeates the book, and to my mind works really well. However if you don't like the sort of British humor used by the Goons (or their cousins/descendants, Monty Python) then this could be a problem.In any case, this is a fascinating and very personal account of the wartime experiences of one of the most original British humorists. Especially recommended reading if you have read the first book in the series ""Adolf Hitler; my part in his downfall""."
3,"Tiny book,","It was okay, had good information. Just a booklet not a book. If you want a quick info on cookie swap. This is good."
3,Pamphlet,"I was extremely disappointed with the size of this book. It is ~25 pages of recipes. I will freely confess that I haven't tried them yet, but I thought that at least one review should address the fact that this is a small booklet. Quanity is not quality, so I will try some recipes and let you know what I think."
3,Comprehensive but lacks depth,"The book contains a very comprehensive list of compounds and plants. However, the plants listed are not referenced to their latin names, so unless you are a botanist, you would not recognize half of the plants listed. As promised by the title of the book, the book lists the names of hundreds of plants and the chemicals in these plants that have been published in scientific literature. Only compounds that have been published in the scientific literature for a specific plant is listed. Compounds present in plants but have not been published in the literature are not even mentioned in the book. The literature in which the compounds were discussed is cited, but there isn't any information on what the compounds do physiologically. Since the book was published in 1991, the references are a bit dated for many of the plants."
2,"Okay, but...","I thought this was just okay. I did feel very relaxed afterwards and might do it again for the stretching. When your muscles are sore from the gym, for example, this would be nice. But it's not really all that difficult, if that's what you're looking for. Certainly not like a yoga class, though I've never taken prenatal yoga."
3,just one short workout,"I like the DVD (2nd trimester), but thought it would have wished to have more than one short workout on it, for variation. Not much on it, honestly , was it 35 min?"
1,Beware,"I bought two. Using the Canon charger, they said ""full"" (green light) way too soon. And do not hold a charge, my S80 needed a battery change 5 minutes after the battery was ""charged"". Both batteries exhibit the same behavior. Too cheap to even bother sending back. Go for a higher quality battery, I learned my lesson."
2,"A little advanced, examples could be better","I'm a senior math major and am using this book in my Analysis I class. I find it a bit difficult to follow, and many students in my class agree that the examples are too few and lack simplicity. It would help if there was an answer key in the back of the book so that solutions could be confirmed. Also, the exercises are not very similar to the examples of a given section of a chapter. Lots of room for improvement."
3,might be something better for snow,"I ordered these for my daughter for x-mas but she refused to wear them. I'm sure they are super for snow and yukky weather, but they look very orthopedic and clunky. They were a little hard to get on with socks and she said it felt like wearing bricks on her feet. She (and I) prefer snow boots or Merrell's in place of these, but they probably have their place."
2,BOND DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY,"Gary Daniels is one of those former kick boxing champion whose buff physique and boyishly good looks have enabled him to star in several straight to video movies. Daniels tries hard, but with his cockney accent and poor scripts hampering him, he's yet to really become a true ""star"". In this attempt to project Daniels into a kind of James Bond role, the movie falls flat due to its slow pacing in the beginning and an unimpressive supporting cast. Nick Boraine as the cunning villain does well, but he isn't on screen a lot until the last fourth of the movie. While the movie does have a high-tension climactic battle, getting there requires a lot of patience on the viewer's part. Darrell Roodt's direction shows some promise in an unusual scene in which we get a slow motion view of a gun flying through the air and the actor's reactions to it; it's a neat visual effect--too bad there weren't more in the entire film."
3,A Section of Whirlwind,"This is great but if you've read Whirlwind, there is no point in reading this one. It is an actual story out of the Whirlwind book. I was upset because I thought I was going to get an extension of Whirlwind characters as a sequel. Read Whirlwind and you'll get all of Escape and much more."
5,What A Great Single !,"Wow this one really caught me off gaurd !I like the new single,her video and the B-side.I'm planning to get her new album right away !Get it while its hot."
1,The worst CD i have ever had - and i have over 3K,"Unfortunately I liked one song at Pandora and sow that these CDs are relatively cheap - now know why -, so I ordered 3 of them. All were horrible, no artistic concern, no great lyrics, nothing...but this one was worst. I recommend you to listen to the sample before buying even if they are 0.01 $."
4,A Nation Challenged Alright,"To this day, our Nation has not faced the Challenge that is 9/11. We as a people still believe that hollow aluminium jetliners laden with fuel are capable of pulverizing to microscopic dust- towers made of steel and concrete.To be clear: Jetliners with a Full Load of Fuel are Incapable of Creating the ""Level, Degree, and Totality of the Destruction"" seen on that Day. Period.Where have all the good people gone? Where are the grownups, the intellectual upper class. The scientists, the logical and rational ones?Oh, Thats right, we were told on Tell-Lie-Vision in no uncertain terms to ""shut up"" about 9/11 and accept the ""fact"" that ""terrorist did it"".Ten Years Later, you owe it to yourself to take a look at the evidence (which includes the photos of 9/11 in this book) and think for yourself.Where Did the Towers Go? Evidence of Directed Free-energy Technology on 9/11"
4,Three Weeks with my brother,"Three weeks with my brother by Nicholas and Micah Sparks is a great book. They take you through their heartbreaking childhood and their trip to Myan ruins, Peru's Incan temples, Easter Island, the killing fields in Cambodia, the Taj Mahal and Ethiopian rock cathedrals. You learn the true meaning of family, friends and to always live your life to the fullest because you never know when something will happen. Reading this book allowed me to understand my life better as well as other people's lives."
4,A Brilliant Departure from his normal genre,"First the disclaimer that I am not a huge NS fan. The plots are too sentimental and predictable for my taste. However, he has been a writing ""student"" for years. Is diligent about the craft and I like him as a person. His self-effacing humor and ability to stay real with where he stands on the totem pole of life...all admirable.Having said all of that and being a fan of memoirs, I was immediately drawn to this even if it isn't exactly something new. It was just new to me. I thought, hands down, this book is one of the best things he has ever done. Give us truth and it always seems more interesting than fiction.Nicholas has had an interesting and challenging life. He has kept his chin up and head down. I laughed, I cried, I warmed in the description of his relationship with his brother...his idol.Absolutely would recommend to anyone and even more if you are a fan of his novels."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I was a big fan of Nicholas Sparks. Until this. The better title would have been ""Three Weeks Where My Brother and I Act Like Spoiled American Frat Boys"". It's no wonder American's get such a bad wrap while travelling abroad. Not only did these two knuckleheads have the nerve to act the part of obnoxious tourists, they then had the nerve to write about it. Go home Sparks brothers."
5,Nicholas Sparks best book so far!!!!,"This is a memoir, unlike his other books, but it is by far the best he's ever written!!!Nicholas finds a trip on line for 3 weeks around the world. He decides to take his brother Micah and it becomes a trip down memory lane. The sadness, excitement, and joy of their life stories are unremarkable! It seems unreal that someone can have this much grief.You will LOVE this book!!!!"
1,Three Weeks With My Brother,"I have never written a review on Amazon but I feel compelled to prevent you from wasting your money on this drivel. I have to wonder whether all the other reviews here were written by Sparks' or the publishers' relatives. This was the most boring, insipid and lame book I've ever attempted to read. It reads like a 7th-graders diary. And any man that would leave his wife on her own with five (yes, five!!) children to go on a 3-week pleasure trip is incredibly selfish, regardless of what she tells him. And Nicholas, I might consider firing your editor - your grammar needs a bit of work."
5,He never fails!,This book really let's you see inside the life of the author we love so much. It makes you appreciate him and his work even more!
1,Is this a memoir or a history textbook?,"I'm not sure what kind of audience Sparks was attempting to capture with this memoir. It seemed about half a history textbook and half an actual memoir. Someone who picks up this book would probably be someone interested in brotherly bonding, not the history of Machu Picchu."
5,Warning,"Warning. Don't read the front cover flap of this book. It is a plot buster.This book is for anyone who ever had a brother or sister or ever wanted one. It describes a trip around the world in three weeks to some of the oldest buildings on this planet. While it seems like they spent more time on the planes than actually in the countries, and they saw more museums than they could handle, they also stood in awe of the world's greatest man-made treasures. Interspersed with the stories of old buildings, there were stories of old relationships: between two brothers, to their parents, to their sister, to their spouses and to their own children. In short a great read.Just don't read the front cover flap before reading the book."
3,Velcro fasteners not a good choice,"Ordered these after trying a pair I borrowed from my instructor. Unfortunately, Amazon did not have the brand she had loaned me. I was disappointed that the size medium were too large.(My hands are not small, even for a female. When I used them for the first time the velcro fastners caught in my swimsuit and pulled, then because they were too large water got inside the gloves. I will donate these and purchase the other brand."
3,they fall apart,"They are good in all respects but longevity. I swim indoors, 3,4-5 days a week an hour at a crack. These are rinsed off in shower afterward and hung on line to dry at home. After 5-6 months the fabric begins to break down and the foam backing on back of hand begins to flake off and float around the pool.That said i haven't found any gloves similar in construction that last any loner. next try is silicone or rubber type gloves"
1,"uncomfortable, not really useful","I was excited about reviews I read, but when I actually used the gloves I was very disappointed... I will be going back to paddles."
4,3rd order of these....,"The first pair was a bit small ... I guess I under estimated the size of my hands. The second pair was great ... so great a friend of mine ended up with them because she too loved them. So these, the third ones are very nice as well, however I traded with my friend because these fit her even better even though they're the same size. I only gave them a 4 because I have 2 pairs of the same size, but they fit very differently because of the way they're sewn. I supposed I should expect this, but I think a little better quality control would prevent this. But, yes, I would certaibly buy them again!"
4,Speedo Aqua Fit Swim Gloves,"I purchased these for my grandaughter who has a very active imagination. She loves to swim , especially under water. She says these swim gloves really help propel her."
4,Speedo Swim Gloves,Pros:Well made. Easy to put on and take off. Good resistance in the water. Comfortable.Cons:Color doesn't hold up to the chlorine in the pool. The color will fade in a short time.
3,It's okay,"I, like many others, I've no doubt, saw Dr Dispenza on 'What The Bleep' dvd. His contribution in that production resonated and inspired me in such a way that I couldn't wait to get this particular presentation. However, this production is in a 'lecture hall format' and although what he has to say is pertinent to his philosophy, there is understandably some repetition of what you've heard before, and a question/answer section that takes up some of the time. Unfortunately, the answers he gave were probably okay for the person asking the question, but I couldn't help feeling that his answers 'droned on' and I came away feeling ""Well, nothing more gained here"". It was a lot of money and quite frankly, he made a more concise and well presented explanation of his ideas in 'What The Bleep'. Get that dvd. It's cheaper and has more information from other scientists supporting Dr Dispenza's ideas as well as a better interview with him."
1,Wrong item 64086 is NOT nickel with white,This item is not as advertised. The title description is brushed nickle with white alabaster...the product you get is black metal with bronze alabaster!! (The product number is the same...) Someone wasn't very careful in the description. Just want to alert you. (A pain...now I have to return it.)
5,superior product,My husband is disabled and we have a caregiver for him several days a week. He has a sore on his buttocks which sometimes opens and is hard to get healed.His caregiver suggested that we try the Aloe Vesta Ointment (she had another patient who she used it on and it was successful.) So I ordered it. It has helped more than any other product I have tried before. It is easy to apply and doesn't stain his underwear. I have just ordered another tube so it will be available when this one is gone.
5,Great stuff!,"I was referred to this product by an ER Nurse. She said that the next strength (#4) is even better but requires a prescription. A family member gets pressure sores frequently and if I use this daily, it clears it up. It's easy to use and not sticky like other barriers."
1,product not as advertised,"I bought this after amazon did their ""vehicle check"" it came up that it fits.. i received it, went to put it in and it did not fit.. then went to ATP's website and this was not the product that fits.. not happy with the purchase"
5,A taboo subject approached openly,"This books approaches in a very open way the issue of sex in the Talmud. Not an easy thing to do... Yet it manages to do so well, without excessively offending one view or another. Through its approach, it probably expores one of the earliest expressions of feminism in Judaism."
1,"the Talmud through a feminist, po-mo lens","you don't have to be a radical traditionalist to understand how Boyarin deliberately misinterprets the Talmud and projects onto it his own feminist, post-modernist ideas."
2,Works for some jars.,"This works well enough. I had bought something else before to replace the one I had for years. The first replacement was useless. So, it is worth mentioning that this works the way it is supposed to. Just one caveat: At first I had trouble using it. Then I realized I was using the larger setting when I should have used the smaller one. Now, when I have trouble opening a jar, I switch to the smaller setting. I haven't had a problem since.Update 12/31/12: As I have used this over time, I am less happy with it. It seems to slip off very lids. It works okay on most other jars. So. I am subtracting one star."
5,Back to Basics 285 Jar Lid Wrench,The very best jar and screw top bottle opener ever. Had this type of opener for 30 years. Just bought my second one (still have the old one) and also purchased for my daughters and elderly mother. Opens everything easily.
3,Good for the price... I guess,"The quality of the picture is ok if you want to watch live tv on your pc. But, if you want to record the video like I wanted to, the quality of the picture isn't the greatest. I was probably asking too much for a $40 product."
1,Don't waste your money,"Well, ripper is not allow selling in this market. It mean all the 321 studio products are useless. Download DVD shrink 3.1 and DVD ripper free online. It is a freeware. Those people gave 5 stars to Xcopy products are the employers in 321 studios"
1,BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!,"The people still selling this program should be ashamed of themselves! They are out to rip you off! This program can no longer be activated and therefore is totally useless. The only people that I know still able to use it, activated the program prior to 321 Studios going out of business. I made the mistake of purchasing this program and now I have useless software. Don't make the same mistake I made."
2,DVDxcopyextreme,I paid over 37$ in product and shipping on this product and most of it works but when I try to burn my dvds it stops after 2-3 minutes of recording. So I advise the consumer to review this product before buying oh the patch files didnot work for me ither?
3,Really Good But...,This gameshark is one of the best of its time. Not only does it have codes for you to play your games but you can get new codes for new games off the net. This product would be great except this doesnt work half the time!!! When you type in codes they will most likely not work and when codes work the game freezes up a-lot. Now if gameshark could clean up its act and make something that works 99.9% of the time I would buy this for much more than the price!!!
1,Broken... CD?,"Alright, so I'm not the most observant of consumers but I knew something was fishy about this purchase. First of all, the title IS ""Gameshark CDX"" but in the pictures they show the product of a Gameshark cartridge, which is what I wanted. It's a lot easier to upload codes, turn them ON/OFF, and etc. I ordered expidited shipping for what I thought would be an awesome Gameshark cartridge that plugs into the back of the system. What I got was a broken CD.Cool, thanks Amazon."
4,it works,Arrived pretty quickly and worked as expected only thing is it wouldn't work on my 3000 series ps2 luckly i had a 5000 series sitting around.
2,Great item for about 4 months,These were great for about 4 months. Then the adhesive fails and you find them fallen off with the batteries depleted. I had mine mounted upside down. Probably would work better on vertical sufaces. I plan to use a better adhesive. Magnets have to align and come fairly close to light. Otherwise great product.
2,Not totally worthless,"While these lights were a miserable failure in their stated purpose (lighting up drawers) as they didn't stick properly and were difficult to place, they're not totally of no value. They each contain several lithium button batteries which are of a very common size and can be used in other battery-operated devices. I threw the lights away and kept the batteries."
2,This review is just FYI,"I bought this for my 10 year old girl who had smaller pack of stix. The sticks that she had were 10 inches long and 1/8 inch thick. The sticks in the box are 6 inches long and little thicker than 1/16 inches. The size of the box is misleading and the included sticks are disappointment if you wanted the bigger sticks.I gave this item low 2 stars because of the misleading packaging. I know, I should have read the item description. The thing is, I did read it twice, and both times I missed where it says sticks are 6 inches long. I am hoping that someone in my situation read the low ratings to get the full information. Otherwise, this is fun toy for hands-on, creative kids."
5,The most WIKKIs for your bucks!,"*** EDIT: I posted my price analysis when this was selling for <$13! Price has gone up since then... ****This is a great take-anywhere toy that appeals to a wide range of ages. And I have not seen a better price-per-Wikki than this!People take them in their cars, keep them in their ""wait bag"" as time fillers when kids need to be kept busy, use them at family reunions and other gatherings for a multi-age activity!Don't let the kids see the size of the whole box or they will use them up too fast. Wikki Stix don't grow on trees, ya know!"
3,Bandura is the brain,"I've not read this particular book, but I recommend Bandura for anyone who really wants to give her/his cerebral cortex a workout. At times his writing is very dense and obtuse in translation (I find him only a little easier to follow in his native Spanish), but the connexions he makes are always worthy of full consideration."
1,not worth it,"My 5 and 8 years old were excited to put this toy together. What a waste of time and money. The tracks are poor, the cars are cute, but the launcher is absurd!! It simply doesn't work right. I'm so dissapointed that I'm taking it back to the store."
4,Mine didn't come with a swimming pool!,"I gotta say -- I can't believe anyone expects this product to come with a noodle! Were you surprised when it also didn't come with 5,000 gallons of water?? It's an ACCESSORY! Never once when I looked at the picture did I expect it to come with a noodle. Whiners."
1,What a mess,"""Speedball 2100"" is a remake being offered by Empire as part of it's value priced catalog. While 3-D has been added, the makers wanted to keep the spirit of the original. After playing the game, I ask: ""Why?"". In a half-baked effort to ""upgrade"" to 3-D, the players look like road kill. The graphics are dark and dull, and so is the sound.Even worse, SB is UNforgivably unplayable, and for a game called ""Speed"" ball, the players are so slow. There is a GM function, but this game is so bad, who cares?What a shame. With a little effort this game could be great. Instead, the makers figured at the low price, you could regurgitate it and land a few nostalgia gamers and cheapskate curiosity seekers.With 4 next generation systems to be on the market in a few months, marketing a game like ""Speedball 2100"" as a stand alone product at this point in time has to be called into question. At any price. -Dan Moreland"
1,Big Disappointment,"Stay away from this game even if you loved in on the Amiga. The game should be renamed ""Slowball 1984"" for it's speed and graphics. I'm really surprised others rated this well."
5,You need this one,"This has designs for everything. I love it. If you like to cross stitch you need this book. It shows you what each designs looks like finished. It has small designs that can be used anywhere or be used together. I have used it to make towels,bibs, breadcloths, for use with waste canvas. This is the best value ever, I wish they would make another one."
3,In general. . .,A word about Luis Miguel: he's great for one or two songs. . .but listening to an entire album is like spending and eternity in a bad movie. He cries far too much for my taste.
4,The hottest CD,"It was this summer that a relative of mine make me listen to Luis. And after experince his sound I was sold.This is by far the most beautifull cd i ever heard. Especially ""Contigo""."
4,Quantum Physics for the rest of us,"I've always be fascinated with Stephen Hawking, for everything that he has overcome and for all that he has achieved, which would be remarkable in and of itself. While is book, a brief history of the universe looks interesting, it's size I feel is a bit daunting. So I thought this would be a good intro book, and it was very well written by John Boslough. In such a short book he shows not only many of Stephen's early work, but showed a bit of the man behind the theories, including little stories of his sense of humor."
2,A weak retelling,"I was intrigued when I first saw this book, but after reading it, I am only disappointed. The book was shallow and unengaging throughout. Shinn focuses on trite details, such as ensuring that all parallel characters have similar names, without bringing anything new or meaningful to the storyline. Oddly enough, she brings in ""Janet Ayerson"" as a foil for her heroine, Jenna Starborn. Janet Ayerson is kind, but weak and uninteresting. I can only interpret this as a criticism of the original Jane Eyre. What would cause Shinn to cast Charlotte Bronte's heroine in this light? Charlotte Bronte was a feminist before her time, and Bronte's heroine displays more strength and integrity than her hero. If you want to read Shinn, I would recommend ""Heart of Gold"" or ""Summers at Castle Auburn."" Or better yet, read the original ""Jane Eyre."""
1,Not Shinn's best work,"I have been a fan of Sharon Shinn since I read ARCHANGEL back in 1998. That said, this does not meet up to some of her previous offerings. The story of Jane Eyre has been moved to a foreign planet and imbued with some technological advances, but these add little to the emotional content of the story. Personally, I would rather read an original story by Shinn than a rehashing of something that Charlotte Bronte did perfectly well. So if you have loved Sharon Shinn in the past, go back and read (or re-read) ARCHANGEL or HEART OF GOLD. Both are original, brilliant works that will warm the heart and stir the imagination to a far greater extent than Jenna Starborn."
2,not her best work,"Its an interesting concept, projecting a Bronte novel into the future, however her character development was better in her prior novels. Perhaps being constrained to the antiquated Bronte novel formula constricted her tendencies to make her characters the usual heartbreakingly real. If you are just starting to read Sharon Shinn, I highly recommend starting with the Archangel trilogy and the ""Shape Shifter's Wife"".Wish I bought this one at a used bookstore or borrowed it from the library."
4,Positives and Negatives,"This children's book is illustrated marvelously. The illustrations emphasize exciting colors and add great detail to the expressions on the rabbit's faces. Overrall, this book is classroom orientated because it reiterates the numerals 1-10 and provides a great review to a math lesson. Also, the rhyme scheme is clever and entertaining. However,some of the words that are used are not in young reader's lexicon. If it is thought to be used as a social studies connection, it may be unappropriate for educating children about Native Americans. The pictures imply that Native Americans always live in tipis' and wear feathers in their hair."
4,The Lyle Lovett Primer,"For those of you who always write Lyle off as country and western, check this video out. While he does C&W very well, his large band is a tour de force of swing and jazz. Lyle Lovett really can't be pigeon holed into one class or another, he's too diverse. This video bears that out. To his credit, he always recognizes the talent that he plays with, too. Just listen to Francine Reed on this DVD, and you'll become a fan of hers as well. I've seen Lyle with his large band, during his Texas songwriter tribute, with John Hiatt, Guy Clark and Joe Ely, and most recently with John Hiatt and himself sharing an acoustic evening. ALWAYS a memorable show, and this DVD spotlights just one of Lyle Lovett's many facets. Good straightforward camera work and very good sound make this ""concert"" one for my library."
4,History as it should be written,"This book is a well written, interesting view of the men who served on this ship and their interactions. It is honest and doesn't gloss over the reality of the real personalities of real people in a difficult period in our history.Most ""History"" is bunk (as Henry Ford is credited with saying), and tells the ""spin"" of the winners and the rich and the powerful. This is a very good example of what history should be. The book also includes chapters on the devastating attacks on USS LST-808 and battleship USS Pennsylvania."
3,Management of Risk,"This volume is a practical, hands-on guide to implementing effective risk management practices in the corporate environment. It details what you should do in a clean, no-nonsense style. The text is easy to follow, and the examples that are given are always relevant to the discussion at hand. My only caveat to this book is the fact that its publication was more than three years ago, and the area of risk management has grown considerably during that time. I urge the publishers to put out an update."
4,Perfect Summer Read!,"What isn't to love? Engaging characters that you can get into, a fast-moving plot and a wonderful writing style. Great reading by the pool, on the beach or curled up on the sofa. Read this along with Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin, another incredible summer read that will take you places you've never been before. And it's written by a guy! Keep them coming, JAK."
1,Just not for me,"I have to tell you for the average midwest simple minded cook, this is not the book for me. I was pretty disappointed when I received the book as a gift. The recipes seem to be to involved and high maintence ingredience. I think this book is more for the expreinced gourmet cook than us simple minded ones."
3,A little over my head,"This one gives a series of techniques that I do not htink I could pull off without seeing all four hands. I suppose if you kile double-dummy problems, this book is for you.However, it does show the vast range of things that are possible. Maybe they require more imagination that I can provide in normal single-dummy play."
4,"Not too bad, not very good either","Yes, this guide is good and is absolutely necessary if you don't wanna have to use an Internet walkthrough. The reason i bought this is because the offical Pokemon Emerald Walkthrough didnt have coverage on the f/r and l/g pokemon and because I had recently bought Pokemon Fire Red. The cons of this book are:The pages started falling out after a few weeks of carefull and responsible use of it, spelling mistakes are present but not as common as in the Pokemon Emerald book plus the Emerald books smaller! It doesn't say how to get: Celebi, Lugia, Mew, or Deoxys, what a rip!"
4,$50 on eBay - amazing value,"Most of the above nit-picking is correct. The Bill Evans disk especially is a puzzler. HOWEVER for $50 on eBay or roughly $75 here, this set is a good deal. I'd have picked different disks overall -- good god! that horrible MTV set? ugh! -- but we all have our favorites, so I can't fault the suits too much for choosing as they did. We got some gems included, to be sure! ""Sings For Two"" and ""When Lights Are Low"" are exquisite sets.If you are a novice, try the ""40 Years"" box set. You can get it for a song -- haha! -- cuz it was surpassed by the ""50 Years"" box. Then I'd jump in here. Or vice versa would work too. There's a lot of value here and in the other sets. Jump in! You CANNOT go wrong."
2,disappointed,"This is a disappointing release and offers little that is new to the dedicated collector, even ""When Lights Are Low"" has had a previous CD release in Japan on Sony CSCS 5242 - we really need a release of the albums not on CD !"
5,Memorable and unique.,"This movie feels like high-caliber live theater. That might be why some folks don't care for it. (I have a friend who doesn't think a movie is any good unless there's at least one car chase. It's just a matter of taste.) But as straightforward drama, this movie is memorable. The movie has heart and substance, and the actors should all be proud of their performances."
3,could have been better,"What keeps this movie from being more than O.K. is the dialogue. At times it is groanable. With more attention to the writting, this could have been a really good film. With this caveat, it's still worth a viewing."
2,Cliches and yelling,"The film piles gay son/unaccepting father clichés one on top of the other until the whole thing collapses. That might be amusing in and of itself, but the overwrought dialog consists almost entirely of yelling. The cinematography is nice, and Jason Behr is adorable. If that's enough for you, consider renting. I can't imagine wanting to own this so that I could watch it repeatedly."
2,RITES heavy on Melodrama,"Contrary to many, I found this film to be cloying and melodramatic. The plot and the writing often seem forced, and the performances occasionally border on the ridiculous. I found it to be a little hard to take seriously, but I know several viewers who found it to be utterly realistic. It is certainly gratifying to see an actor of Dean Stockwell's stature helping the genre of gay film to stretch its borders and its visibility, but this film was for me a mixed bag at best."
4,My son loves this!!,"I was using this as a bathroom spray, as it didn't work for me on my body and visitors would ask what smelled so great. Now my son (who is in his 30's) said he sprays his car and himself and the girls love it!! So clean and fresh all year long! Nice clean scent!!!"
3,Due Diligence,Overall good mystery but slow in parts. Would recommend for those who love murder mysteries. A few surprises along the way.
2,Drifting Fans Only,"This video wasn't that cool. The quality sucked and the sound quality of the actual interviewees was horrible! I felt like someone made this with their home camera and nothing else. You definitely would have to be a pretty big drifting fan to appreciate the low quality of this dvd but if you are, then hey, it's great for you. There were some cool parts but overall, this wasn't worth the purchase and definitely wasn't what I expected."
4,Mostly great fun,"Since the Wordweaving review of this book furnishes a good plot summary, I'll just add that the book is indeed pretty enjoyable; Lydia and Sam do jump the gun and wind up sleeping together once, but the episode is fairly low-key. A particularly fun read for those who can sympathize with Sam's domestic woes."
2,Aqua Rocker,"Years ago we purchased a ""rock 'n' teeter"" for the pool. My kids LOVED it. They could seesaw until they fell in. Great fun! It eventually met it's demise, so I did some research and decided to purchase the ""Aqua Rocker"" It looked like great fun and larger. My kids are also larger to we went with it.Unfortunately this is NOT a rock 'n' teeter. In fact it does not rock at all. It is a large saucer that simply bends backward when the kids try to rock. It does not ""rock"" at all. Disapponitment. Would not purchase again."
4,Sound Forge Audio Studio Great Product,"Exactly as advertised, meets my needs and expectations. I us this product on a regular basis because it makes me do a great job of editing and making CDs."
2,false packaging,"the product arrived on time and in good shape. the packaging was attractive, but inside the goodies were scant. each container was mostly empty space. example would be a package that could hold six pieces would only have two. will NEVER purchase again!!!"
5,Great for a chocolate lover,"I gave this as a gift to a favorite cousin who is an admitted ""chocoholic"". She reported that there was nothing included that was ""throwaway"". All the products first class and the kind of truffles, chocolates, cocoa and so on that a true lover of the bean likes. Quantities were sufficient to give you a decent taste of each one. I had become discouraged with gift baskets that had a couple good items and a bunch of stuff nobody would love. This one is not that way; actually safe--and satisfying--to send someone you really like!"
3,razor,"Close shave for not too much $, however does not hold a charge for more than 3 shaves. I find myself leaving it plugged in all the time which is not very green..."
2,NOT VERY HELPFUL - ESPECIALLY FOR THE MONEY...,"I bought a couple books on this subject and was really disappointed by this one. It wasn't hilarious and it wasn't very original. I thought it was going to offer some new, different, insightful information but it didn't. The illustrations are cute, but frankly, this was a waste of my money when there are funnier, CHEAPER, more helpful, and just plain better books out on the subject."
1,This highcar is HORRIBLE!,"We bought this for our daughter last xmas and altho she tries to play with it, she usually ends up frustrated by it being REALLY HARD TO GET A DOLL INTO THE CHAIR even for an adult. It's really flimsy and poor quality. We are getting her a traditional wooden doll high chair instead. Please save your money and find something else. The Little Mommy doll barely fits in the chair... and it's difficult to get the doll back out!"
1,"17"" laptop doesn't fit","this bag would have been perfect if my 17"" Dell Studio laptop actually fit inside, as advertised - it's a really nice bag if your laptop is smaller"
1,Stylish not practical,"Not pleased because I paid extra to have it delivered two days after I ordered it and that did not happen. I was never given an opportunity to rate the seller- and leave feedback. The backpack itself is not very practical-which is what I was looking for, but it is stylish and I teach in a middle school and the kids love my work bag- but that was not what I was going for."
5,Awesome,"This CD. Recording is excellent and the performers sing beautiful.Also, it expands your knowledge of other works.When Naxos decided to enter the opera field I was reluctant of the results. Beethoven's Fidelio, and Alceste certanly show thet I was wrong.Buy it with confidence"
4,Way worth the money! great value!,"I bought this cover and to my suprise the quality was actually better then I thought it would be! The vinyl seems a tiny bit on the thin side, but c'mon, what do you want for $10? canvas? this cover is well suited to protect your grill from all of the elements. The cover fits well, but it's also very easy to slip on without much hassle. I have used and abused mine and it still has no rips or holes. The only downsides I can really think of are; it is a bit thin (but feels durable enough to protect your grill) and to my knowledge it only comes in one bland light blue-ish color."
3,Pretty Good until She fades,the show started off good&then around the middle of the show Chaka Khan just kinda went down from there.the Band was on point but Her vocals strayed&after a while it felt like She was just going through the Motions.if this Performance had have stopped early after a few songs then it would have been tight but it goes a bit to long.the Musicianship was tight throughout nevertheless.
5,I'm so pleased,This is a high quality piece of equipment. No assemble required. I'm enjoying using it every day. I love variety and music and hate the gym atmosphere so this is perfect for me. I look forward to exercising because it's fun.
2,"Although this is nice and compact, the sound is horrible","I sell this product where I work, and when I first saw this recorder, I thought it looked sooo cool. It was soo small and fit in the palm of my hand. I was in for a surprise when i tried it out. The sound was horrible. I couldn't even understand a word I was saying. I've had way better experiences with analog (cassette) recorders. From my experience from selling these products I would totally recommend getting a mini tape recorder rather than a digital. I have yet to find a digital recorder with as clear or better sound quality from the traditional tape recorders."
4,A great tool for people on the run!,This is a great tool for recording important info on the run. As a Builder I have gotten very use to the convenience of recording important notes and thoughts as I go for playback and placing them in my day planner for latter retrevial and action! If you are looking for high tech voice recognition this is not for you! If you want a basic tool to handle large amounts of information fast this is for you! The only bad thing is the recorder likes to turn on by itself in your pocket which can mean problems!
4,Great item with one flaw,"I use this recorder every day to make notes and record to-do items while driving, etc. It works very well and the recording quality is decent enough for what I use it for. There is one large design flaw, though. The record button is MUCH too easy to press. At least 4 times a week, I'll try to record a message only to find a 70+ minute recording of me walking around with this in my pocket. All I do is delete that message and I'm back in business, but it's annoying."
5,An Inside Look!,This was such an up close and personal look at The Whispers. A very wonderful enlightening peek at them. This is a treasure for your Whispers collection. You've gotta have it!
2,"BUENA ENTREVISTA, PERO SIN CONCIERTO","ESTE DVD TIENE SOLO DOS CANCIONES, LAS DOS MUY BUENAS, PERO DE 90 MINUTOS QUE DURA EL DVD, 80 CORRESPONDEN A LA ENTREVISTA DE CON DEBOR'AH BENTON.SERIA BUENO QUE SACARAN SOLO UN DVD CON UN CONCIERTO COMPLETO DE ELLOS.SI QUERES SABER SOBRE LA HISTORIA DE ELLOS COMPRALO, PERO SI QQUERES ESCUCHARLOS, NO GASTES DINERO."
1,very bad hinge design,"I do not use these shears professionally, just around my home. I purchased them spring of 2010. Initially they worked well and the Power Lever design gives good cutting power. The weak design link is really sad however when you discover it. The blades of the shears are held together, not with nuts and bolts, not even with washers and rivets but merely a pin that is punched to say in place. Unbelievable! Of course it falls out after limited use and it's not a matter of if they will fail but simply how quickly they will fail. I have requested a replacement under their lifetime warranty but if there is no difference in construction expect they too will fail fairly quickly.Sad, as they are otherwise nice shears."
1,"garbage, dont waste your money!","buy another brand, the pin drops out and the blades dont function properly, the plastic knobs, crack off after a while, ( see my pictures) I am about to call for my replacement will see how they treat me and then repost.Update: fiskars did replace mine, with the exact same model. I am sure the are just trying to get rid of the old models. I will be more careful when I select my garden tools in the future, whomever the manufacturer."
5,Delivers what it promises,"I read the bad review below and really have to ask what that reviewer expected from a book that has ""Plain and Simple"" in the title? This book delivers exactly what it promises: a plain and simple look at Microsoft Access. It quickly walks you through the basic knowledge and tasks of Access and essentially holds your hand by providing excellent step-by-step full color pictures that show you exactly what to do on nearly every page. Can you get through this book quickly? Yes. Is it for beginners? Yes. If you want lessons on database design, theory, etc., look for a book with ""in-depth"", ""mastering"" or similar phrases in the title. I bought this book when I had to learn Access quickly, and it didn't disappoint."
2,Scratching the Surface.,"This book is only if you want to make a very simple database. It has no depth, and just briefly explains the various objects of access. Anybody looking to make a decent database, either small-business or home financials will not go anywhere with this book. I would strongly recommend that you invest a few more dollars for a better book.I started working on access a few weeks ago, and after a few hours all the stuff in this book became easy. You could easily learn what they have in this book by yourself. What you need though is a book which explains access once you start getting in the nitty-gritty parts of the program. Hoped this helped."
5,Happy Birthday,"HAPPY 54TH BIRTHDAY JEFFREY OSBORNE....FROM YOUR BIGGEST FANS;RHONDA--->SANTA BARBARA,CALIFORNIA DONNA-->TEXAS AND DANA-->NEW YORK.......WE LOVE YOU AND CELEBRAtE THIS DAY TO THE FULLEST........YOUR NUMBER ONE FANS"
1,No useful information,"If you are a do-it-yourselfer DO NOT but this book! It talks in generalities about everything and specifically about nothing. I built my own 4 season addition and found the book ""framing floors,walls and ceilings"" to be very helpful with actual instructions on how to do things.This might be an ok book for someone planning an addition but will not be doing any work. My advise, dont waste your money!"
4,History Buff,"I am a big history buff, especially for Ancient Rome. This ebook takes your through all the great men of Ancient Rome, and will make an excellent gift for history buff in your life! Quite enjoyable and detailed without being boring so you never feel that the reading is just dragging. I know what I'm getting my dad for Father's Day!"
1,JUNK,"Cruzin Coolers are JUNK! I bought one to give away for a prize a few months back, and the front tire went flat in the closet!! The cooler had not even been driven outside! I called the 1800 number, and they said they could ship me out a new tube, at my cost of course... I know its only a $13 tire tube, but if they will not even stand behind this, you can only imagine how they would handle a battery or larger problem!!"
3,doesn't really do anything to progress it beyond 1987,"Warmachine were quite popular on the Megadeth Message Boards about four years ago (that's where I first heard them). For years I was baited with killer samples of what was to come. As the years past by, the Canadian metal act finally put together a full-length album (with some help from ex-Megadeth bassist Dave Ellefson - imagine that). After all the wait, after all the hype, it's finally here in my hands. Was it worth it? Not really. They certainly have that classic thrash metal/Bay Area sound nailed down, but Warmachine doesn't really do anything to progress it beyond 1987."
3,Hard to stay in place,"I purchased this item for my newborn boy after getting sprayed multiple times a day. The idea of the pee pee teepee sounded great, but it was hard to use. It didn't really stay in place. It is a little small so it has to be held down while changing the diaper which was quite a challenge. After trying a few times my husband and I finally gave up on using it."
1,"Poor quality, not absorbent enough, too small","I bought these for my newborn son who peed everywhere, every time we changed him. These get one star for being really cute and a good idea in theory. However, unless your child stays perfectly still while being changed, these do not stay put. They were too small to cover my newborn son's privates without falling off with the slightest movement. Also, the one time that it stayed put long enough for him to pee in it (he basically started peeing right after I put on the teepee), it was not absorbent enough to hold all his pee and it dripped down onto him, the changing table and his outfit. I would not recommend spending the money on these. We just use a preemie sized cloth diaper over him during each change and when he does pee, that generally catches it all."
2,cute but does not work,These are really cute and a good idea if they actually stayed on. It falls off 2 seconds after I put it on.
2,cute idea,"This is a cute idea, but as the baby becomes active the tee pee falls off. Don't waste your money, just use a baby wipe or towel."
3,super cute but too big for a newborn,these are probably great but for a wiggly 2 week old they are too big to stay put. i'll update when he's a little older.
3,Good Performance - Video Quality Not So Much,"I took a chance on this one as I like Corea's electric work but saw no reviews for it and there was limited info given here on Amazon.Ok, it's a good performance of the early band, just trio of keyboards, bass and drum and the tunes are great.Low production values though, the camera work is adequate but somewhat grainy. The sound is stereo (?) only, no 5.1 mix but I was able to tweak some good enough sound out of it with my Yamaha home theater system.Worth getting IMO but nowhere near as good as the Montreux DVD. Good documentation of this period of the band. Region 0... I was able to play it."
3,Chick Not too electric in this one.,I really Taught that this one will be a very good DVD.But is not a good quality and it is only a five songs setlist.
4,Life on Earth,"I bought this book as a first year biology text for school. It is an excellent book on biology and basic organic chemistry. The large format allows for many good color illustrations of the material. Even if you are not using it as a textbook, I recommend it to anyone interested in biology."
2,Useless for Jewelry,I was hoping that this would get hot enough but it only gets as far as melting the flux despite turning it all way up and seeing what I thought was a decent flame. Unfortunately it wouldn't melt the solder. I'm going to try out the Blazer Micro Torch and tend to the fire scale that I'm now left with.
4,Great book,"This was a good book overall, however, two pages were missing! They werent ripped out, they just werent printed in the book. Nonetheless, the book got to me on time and in great condition. Overall, good book!"
2,Be ready to stand by the crib for a while,"Really cool mobile, and the baby loves it. But the running time is so short, I end up standing beside the crib to rewind in 15 times. Disappointing."
3,"Small diamond, but ring is nice.","I purchased this ring about a year ago in the white gold and have worn it daily since. The diamond is tiny and doesn't stand out much, but for the price it's a nice enough ring. When I received the ring the white gold was shiny and bright.Now, a year later, the white gold plating has worn off and the ring has a very noticeable yellow tinge. Just a thought when purchasing white gold rings, plan to save money to have the ring replated because it won't stay white forever."
3,"Good, But NOT GREAT.","The guide is good, the walkthrough is fine, but Nintendo just didn't give this one much effort. The game rocks, but the guide lacks some vital detail (Zess T. recipe health stats, Pit of 100 trials detail). The guide is good if you want to get through the basics of the game, but compared to past Nintendo guides (especially the one for the original Paper Mario) this guide is rather dissapointing."
5,great resource for phoenix!,"great resource for gardening in phoenix. although his perspective is for tucson in specific, you can use his expertise to apply to phoenix. with so many short growing seasons, you can't live without this handy reference guide to help you make the most of your vegetable garden!"
4,Desert Gardening Bible should be the title of this one!,"If you've lived in most parts of the country and have moved to the desert, you need this book if you want to garden. (Especially trees and veggies.)The organization isn't the greatest but there's so little material published about the unique requirements for desert gardening that it just doesn't matter. Boy did I learn some new tricks."
1,High School subject matter and writing quality,"I found nothing in this anthology of interest to an adult audience of any age. No biographies of the ""playwrights"" are given. I'm pretty sure I know why."
5,Highly recommended for students of Eastern Spirituality,"Embracing Heaven & Earth is a 96 minute recorded talk by Andrew Cohen when he addressed an attentive audience at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado. Cohen laid out the complete foundation of his teaches of liberation which he refers to as ""The Five Fundamental Tenets of Enlightenment"". Very highly recommended for students of Eastern Spirituality, metaphysics and religion, Embracing Heaven & Earth gives listeners an clear and intimate exposition of profound spiritual laws and conveys their immediacy, significance, and life-transforming potential."
5,Nice product,"This is a well made cover that comes with its own bottle. The cover is durable, but will not hold any other product than the bottle that came with it - at least not that I found. I use insulated covers over 24 oz soda-type bottles and this would not work. But my son is using it for his water bottle. I've seen cheaper water bottles, but I still have some doubts of the life-expectancy of this one."
2,Poor Display,"I have only used the thermometer once since purchasing it a few weeks ago, but have great trouble reading the screen. The screen has a number of things pre-printed on it, apparently. Just as shown in the picture of the item on the Amazon order page, ""BEEF"" and the temperature for beef, and a few other things, seem to be printed on the plastic screen. Whatever words then apply to what I've programmed for -- chicken, for example -- appear behind these. That makes it VERY hard to read. I thought the Amazon picture of the item, which shows ""BEEF"" etc., was probably a sample of a programmed reading. Had I known these things would always be displayed and cover up my programming, I don't think I would have bought it. This is the first time I recall truly being disappointed with a product purchased from Amazon."
2,"Probe works fine, that's about all.",I don't care for this product. it is not intuitive to use and I really don't like that it doesn't show the seconds counting down. The thermometer works fine and that was the main reason for the purchase and why I have kept it.
2,Worked great until it didn't,"I purchased this item about 6 months ago, and have used it probably 20 times since then. It always worked great but is now giving me a HH or LL error, and as best I can tell this means that the probe is burned out. Seems like a short shelf life for a product like this. Might be time to go back to the trusty analogs."
1,Worked for 12 Hours - Then Quit!,"I used this thermometer to monitor the temperature of cocoa butter I was heating in a double boiler. I only used it for a total of about 12 hours, then it totally quit being accurate. I put the probe in the freezer and it said it was 172 degrees F. Boo. Ultra-Fail.This thing makes a horrible, long beeping noise when it turns on.It's also not an option to not 'choose' a meat to cook. It always has some kind of comparison going on and won't just show you the temperature it is currently measuring. There's lots of blinking and stuff for this reason.If it weren't for the whole quit working thing, I'd give it a 3.5 star rating. It's OK. Because it quit working, I say don't buy it."
5,Oven thermometer,"I love this item. It is so easy to use, just insert in meat, adjust to right kind of meat, put the unit on the counter or side of stove and close the door. They will do the rest and let you know when the right temperature is reached."
3,Cheap and easy but not reliable,"The thermometer is just like any digital thermometer. It's easy to use, it's low cost, it does its job. I used it for a variety of tasks, including homebrewing and turkey roasting. But it doesn't reliably do its job. I've gone through two replacement probes for this thermometer and I'm in need of a third. Unfortunately, the probe design just isn't up to the task of repeated use, something keeps failing in it.While the price point is good fo this one, I'll probably not buy another replacement probe and instead buy a different brand."
1,LED Unreadable after 3 months,This thermometer was the first one I bought for my Komodo Kamado. It looked good because the sensor wire was detachable and I could pass it through the hole in the ceramic grill. It worked fine for about 3 months. Programming it is not intuitive. You have to read the manual. But don't waste your time because the LED became unreadable after about 3 months. Could not read the temperature or most of the rest of the display. So I cannot recommend this thermometer. Am now looking for a replacement.
4,NOTE TO YOGURT MAKERS: Does not alert on cool-down,"I bought this primarily to help in making yogurt. I love the clip that attaches the probe to your pot, but the alert only works going one-way - when the temperature rises. If you want to also be alerted when your milk cools to the right temp, this model won't do it. That said, still find it handy and much better and easier to use than a non-digital thermometer.I've also used it once in the oven for roasting a chicken. I thought the recommended temp of 180 cooked the bird a little too long (I put the probe horizontally through the breast), so next time I will manually set the temp to 160 and see how that turns out.I've only used it 3 times total over a course of a few weeks, so no comment yet on its durability."
4,So Far So Good - the thermometer is working great,"So far the meat thermometer is working just as advertised. It is relatively easy to use, and seems to give accurate temperatures. Other reviews have cautioned that some of the units have quit working properly after several months. I will keep my fingers crossed and enjoy using it in the meantime."
2,How do you turn it off?,"Maybe it's just me, but I've had this for years, and haven't ever been able to figure out how to turn it off without taking out the battery. Am I supposed to just let it slowly run down the battery? Otherwise, it works fine for me."
3,a bit difficult to use,"My probe went south on my Pyrex branded timer so i thought i would get one with a higher rating (temp wise) as my old one was only rated to 350 degrees or so.this one is rated to 425 or so.the interface is not very user friendly so don't throw out the instruction booklet or you'll be digging through the trash like me trying to figure it out! this is the reason i only give it 3 stars, and the fact it doesn't show seconds.the alarm isn't all that loud either so don't plan on being to far away, you will not hear it.i would look else where. not a good value in IMHO.Regards,JJufon"
2,Great while it worked,"***Updated Review***Ok, second and third ones lasted less than a year each as well. I'm finished doling out money for this piece of garbage. It's a good idea and I can't imagine why it can't be implemented in a way that would make it last for more than one month (unit number three) up to six (the first and second). These needs drastic improvement before it's worth spending money on.***Original Review***For the last six months I've loved this. It did it all. Unfortunately, it's now off by 75 degrees. I'll be sending it back on warranty but, regardless, pretty poor quality if it can't survive a year of basic kitchen use."
2,where's the beep?,"I used this for the first time in a standing rib roast for Christmas dinner. I never heard any kind of tone when it got up to temperature. Thank goodness I had been keeping an eye on it, because, on close inspection, I saw it flashing. It had only gone a few degrees over, and at least dinner wasn't ruined."
1,A total piece of garbage,"Upon receiving this item, I tested it in some ice water. It read 90F. That's right. 90F.What a total waste of time. I'm now re-thinking my previous CDN thermometer purchases."
1,Never worked,I was in great need for an item like this. but It was very disappointing when I was ready to use it for the first and it did not work. When I turn it on it let out a load beeping noise.
1,"Failed by giving false ""low battery"" warnings","I've had two of these that, after a few months, would give ""low battery"" warning beeps, even with a brand new battery."
3,Love book,Love the book but not happy with the time it took to get to me. It was in my mail that would get it on the 15th but did not get it until the 22nd of November I am not a very happy camper with that process
5,One of my kids' favorite Christmas books,"I bought the book because of the beautiful illustrations. I loved all the ""lights"" (kind of reminded me of a Thomas Kincaid painting). But then found out later about the hidden pictures. All 3 kids, ages 3, 5, and 7 love to look for them. Some are real easy to find for the 3 year old and some are tougher for the 7 year old."
5,Typical Snowmen Fun,I love the snowmen books! They have limited text and allow children to make up the story as they look at the book.
5,wonderful book!,"We love all the ""snowmen"" books by this couple! We spend more time looking for the hidden pictures than reading! Kids LOVE this book series!"
2,Gets worse as you go on,"At the start, a lot of what is covered gets a fairly rigorous mathematical treatment, but as you get on through the book, it gets very hand wavy and though there's still lots of maths to do, it's a bit hard to relate it to what Haykin is talking about. Having read the answer book for a lot of the problems, you would think comms engineering is easy, where in fact it's bloody difficult."
1,Poorly written textbook offers no insight!,I wish I could give this book 0 stars!I am using this textbook for an undergraduate communications theory course. The textbook is poorly organized and the writing is difficult to follow! It is difficult to even approach the problems out of the book even after reading the chapters. The text tries to cover a wide range of material while offering little or no insight to the underlying communications principles. Equations after equations with poor explanation is certainly no way to learn communications theory. I deeply regret choosing this textbook for my course. Definitely look to other books if you want to learn some communications theory!!!
2,Not quite what I needed it to be,It worked with ALOT of elbow grease. After which I discovered deep scratches even though I used a soft cloth.
4,Amazing Noodle Chair,Worth the extra few dollars vs. the cheaper version that is not a full mesh seat but rather a half mesh seat with an elastic strap across the front.
2,So wish they'd tell you a few things in the description,We bought these at the end of summer to replace some sit and swim's that busted. I wish they would clearly tell you that you need a BIG NOODLE for these to hold you up.MY dh and I are average weight for our height and neither one of us floated in these. I had to put the 2 together to be able to float just a little I hope next year to find larger noodles so these will truly make us float.
3,Noodle chair,"I ordered this to lounge around in the pool. It says you need a solid 2 1/2"" noodle for it to work as intended. So thinking noodles are cheap $1-$4 I would just pick one up when the chair comes in. Not so easy. I have looked in every store in my town and the next town over and even called a few looking for a solid no joke noodle and it can not be found. You can order one on amazon for $3.75 and $4.25 shipping total of $8.00 for the noodle. It would possibly be a 5 star item if it came with an option to add a noodle for a few dollars or if the noodle was eligible for prime shipping. So without the noodle that it needs it gets a 3 star. I tried it with a regular noodle and it's not awesome and not horrible. Would like to try it with a solid one."
2,Surprised,I was quite surprised when I received my Noodle chair without a noodle - it was not clear that the noodle was not included! The photos shown all included the noodle.
3,Looks good but....,"This is a very sharp looking ensemble, but the soap dispenser leaks. Not for everyday use. Looks good in the guest bathroom."
5,An outstanding grill cover!,"For about $20, Ducane's Premium Gas Grill Cover is surprisingly well-made. Form-fitting, with supple vinyl outer shell and fleece-like interior, this cover will surely protect my new Ducane grill (which is also a great buy) for years to come."
3,So so,"These were decent but, not fantastic they have a stale flavor not a stale crunch. I'll eat them but I probably wont buy again."
2,Good in small amounts,I liked them at first but the flavor is not something that I would continue to crave.
2,EDITED !!!,I don't care what MPI says about these being unedited episodes. They have clearly been edited. Why else would every single episode run exactly 24 minutes? That's not just a coincidence. Back in the early 1970s situation comedies were always slightly over 25 minutes in length. A full minute has been cut from the Doris Day show. Very disappointing.
4,Good overview of Italian history,"This is an informative and easy to read overview of Italian history. It covers ancient through modern Italy and all facets of Italy's development from war and government to art and religion, without going into boring detail. It is a good introduction to Italian history and excellent background material for someone planning a trip to Italy."
1,Pure Drivel,"Anyone who can read would not be fooled by the pandering garbage in this book. Anyone who would be fooled by it probably can't read. Thus, who would possibly buy this book?"
4,interesting,"This is somewhat slow-going with sections that are so dry you will wonder if you can bear to finish the book. However, all in all it is a very interesting read and quite informative. I am glad I stuck with it. Poe is sometimes a pathetic character, sometimes a completely offensive one. If you are interested in literature, this is a must-read."
4,It's the Best!,"If you are looking for a quick review or a quick look into Mythology, this is the perfect book for you. It gives quick, concise accounts of mythology, from the beginning, Chaos which was the source of the first proper beings, to Pandora's box, the Muses, and Pegasus. This book helped my out so much better than any textbook that I've read. It's a wonderful reference book that every bookshelf should have!"
2,Cannot concentrate,"In the original Sweet and Lowdown web site, it was mentioned that Sean Penn learn thirty-some songs for this movie. Prior to making this movie, he never played guitar.I actually looked forward to seeing amazing guitar-playing, and wanted to see the results of hard work and practices. Alas, that's not to be. The playing was lousy at best, and, of course, most of the scenes of playing were spent on an enlarged view of Penn's visage.It saddens me much because, since movies like ""Amadeus"" and ""Shine"", I expect impeccable playing. Even in ""Red Violin"" most playing were done very well except for Sylvia Chang's part (sign). And this bad playing bit (really that bad) just ruins my appetite, however good the story is.I guess this only applies to fuzzy musicians like myself. But it also baffles me since Allen is also a musician. Even Johnny Depp could have been better-suited for this role since he plays decent guitar."
2,"Good film, bad dvd",This is a crippled dvd edition of a great movie. Original aspect ratio is 1:1.85. Picture on the dvd is 1:1.33.
5,Loved this movie!!!,"Sean Penn stars along with Samantha Morton (both were nominated for Oscars) in this classic jazz-age tale directed by Woody Allen. Penn's character, a fictional jazz guitarist is so entirely believable and interwoven with true jazz history (helped along by a great jazz soundtrack) that for a while, I spent time looking for books and info about Emmett Ray. Only later did I discover that he never really existed. Egocentric, odd, and engagingly funny, ""Ray"" keeps this story moving with a series of romances and mis-adventures worthy of Don Quixote. People might be tempted to overlook this gem as simply another Woody Allen movie, but to do so is a huge mistake! Five years after it's release date, it remains a largely undiscovered comedic masterpiece worthy of rental or purchase. I've personally watched this movie countless times since...."
3,Another letdown,"Woody Allen has yet another so-so film mar his c.v. There was no reason to spend this amount of time and money on the barely-known story of a narcissistic jackass who thought he was above all human morality and even decency. Yes, the photography, the directing, the acting, and casting are first class. But who cares, unless you're a film student or one of the tiny minority who are into pre-bop jazz guitar?This film isn't a comedy because it isn't funny. It's more like a tragedy about someone who, in every way, is detestable. Just what no one needs. Save your money."
3,Polemical Book Perhaps a Victim of its own Rhetoric,"This book attacks current thinking on curriculum, research and scholarship in the higher education institution. Based on the author's own experience in Stanford University, it argues for learners' needs and research agendas to be brought together. But perhaps this is not achievable in a pedagogic context where research issues take priority over learning. Cuban's points are valid enough, but his rhetoric tends to become hectoring on occasions."
2,How can you name your band Derringer?,Don't be confused - this has nothing to do with RICK DERRINGER.
1,Left me stranded after 11 months,"This product was the cheapest pump I could find to replace a broken one in my 2000 Mustang GT. It works fine and has a part number in common with comparable parts on the speed store sites. I didn't need any other parts to do the removal and re-install. The product is as pictured, just the bare pump inside the box.Edit, it died on me after about 11 months, contacting manufacturer now to see if there's any warranty. I paid for a tow and a replacement.Manufacturer never got back to me. Funny, I contacted them when I first purchased it asking if I could ship them my core and they replied. Changed my rating to 1-star. Spend more money and don't get stranded."
4,Fascinating story of intellectual devellopment.,Trigonometry is a flower of the intellect which has roots in the very earliest civilisations. References occur in some of the most ancient known texts. Maor unfolds the concepts and applications as they develloped through history. An inspirational book.
5,Simply the best book on Garabandal,"I read the story on Our Lady of Garabandal 30 years ago but this book is a timely update on what may be Our Lady's most important appearance for our times. It is also the most unusual appearance because she almost lived at Garabandal for 4 years and this time almost coincided exactly with the duration of Vatican II. Was Our Lady trying to tell us about what was to be the most disastrous Council in the history of the Catholic Church? Certainly every informed Catholic should read this book which is priced so reasonably. And you might also thank God for Amazon.comGeorge W. Merkle, M.D. Carlsbad, CA."
1,Producer/Director//Cameraman/Video Editor Ought to be SHOT!,"The music is great, the performance is great, and the audio is great. BUT one buys a VIDEO recording of an orchestra performing in order to SEE the orchestra performing. Yes, its great to see Karajan's conducting, BUT I don't need to just see him ONLY for the duration of the entire recording. Nor am I satisfied merely to be given glimpses of the various sections of the orchestra playing. Certainly not when the entire orchestra is playing! Wonder whose idiotic idea is this to allow us merely peeks here and there as if through the keyhole? Ought to be SHOT! One star, because I didn't get a video recording - its only as good as an audio one..... Fume!!!!"
3,A good 6th but an ordinary 7th.,"The 7th symphony may be the only one that I do not enjoy in all three Karajan/Berliner Philharmoniker's Beethoven Symphony Series. The speed is too fast which makes one feel a little too shaky. I would prefer the one performed by Karl Bohm/Wiener Philharmoniker in 1970s. I abandoned the idea to collect Karajan's 1980s Beethoven Symphony Cycle on CDs after listening to the 9th Symphony but I am still going to collect this set on DVDs, since it's not likely to get a better DVD set of Beethoven's symphonies. I would never go for it if I had a chance to have Beethoven's symphonies played by Karajan/Berliner Philharmoniker, Karl Bohm/Wiener Philharmoniker or Georg Solti/Chicago Symphony in 1970s on DVDs."
4,"Not ""Bimbos..."" but still good","Well, I agree that this book is not as sharp as ""Bimbos of the Death Sun,"" but McCrumb's humorous slant on fans of SciFi/Fantasy and, to a lesser degree, the on-line community, is still prevelant. And of course, Dr. J. O. Mega and Dr. Marion Farley work well together, lending a comfortable atmosphere to their investigation of the obligatory murder..."
3,my karma ran over my dogma,"For starters, I have to say that I think that Kevin Smith is a much better comedy writer than drama writer. I loved Clerks and really liked Mallrats, even though everyone else seems to want to pretend Mallrats doesn't exist. What's wrong with making a fun movie? On the other hand, Chasing Amy, which the critics loved, I wasn't impressed by. The comedy part was good, but then into turned into not a drama, but a melodrama. The drama in Dogma was much better in my opinion, but the pace of the movie was all wrong. Smith jumps from comedy to drama to comedy all in one scene. It left me dizzy. I'd be laughing over the serious stuff one moment, and then be too preoccupied pondering a serious point to enjoy the next joke. This movie could have been split into two: one comedy, one drama. If those two movies would have been further developed, they would probably both get 5 stars."
2,Dogma doesn't deliver,"I've had a hard time trying to go through this film. I am a big fan of Kevin Smith's previous efforts, I even enjoyed Mallrats. Concerning Dogma, I really don't think Kevin's message whatever it is, really comes through. There are some really hilarious moments, but they are so sparce, that this really can't even count as a comedy (you know there's trouble if the only funny moments are those featuring Jay's comments)."
1,What a horrible movie,"Not clever, not funny. With the amount of talent in this movie, how could someone miss so badly? This movie is aboslutely one of the worst I have ever seen."
1,Terrible,This movie wasn't funny at all. The plot was very poorly written. I probably would have loved this movie if I was still in middle school. The attempt to make the movie mystical was the only part that was funny since it was done so poorly. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.
1,Total Junk!,"I guess maybe, with only a PhD, I'm not sophisticated enough. Reading the other reviews, I get the impression that I should have been paying attention to the hidden, deeper message of this movie. All that apparently went right over my head. I couldn't get past the incessant use of the F-word, and the concept of prophets of God whose main goal is to get a blow job. I found myself amazed that actors with the credentials of Damon and Affleck would allow themselves to be associated with such junk. I don't know the other actors (who seemed to be familiar to other reviewers), nor do I know the director. What I know now is whose works to avoid in the future.Jack"
2,"Great movie, but the DVD lacks.","This is another great film for Kevin Smith: funny, powerful and thought-provoking. I just think they should have gotten another company to make the DVD. All the other films on DVD are loaded with special features like commentary, behind-the-scenes films, and so on. All Dogma had was a trailer and a cast list. Big whoop. I suggest you save your money until they release some kind of Director's Cut edition or something like that. This movie was highly controversial; that fact that they don't treat it that way is an insult to the creators."
3,puts the fun back into fundamentalism....,"I'm giving this a 3 mainly because while I liked the film, the lines weren't that funny to me -- more sit-com quality than topnotch humor. I'd give it a 4 as a rental, though--it's worth seeing, has a great cast, and lays bare the humor in ponderous, concretistic, legalistic, and literal-minded attitudes that take themselves far too seriously.The supersensitive who long for the days when creative irreverence could be repressed in the name of goodness and purity might prefer a Disney flick.Keep an eye out for the corporate boardroom scene -- it's, well, a blast.Movie quiz question: where did they get the line ""I believe in THIS""? Hint: a similarly controversial film for which Peter Gabriel wrote some fine music...."
3,Alanis Morsette... god???,"The movie is done well, with it's brilliant screenwriter. It's the most comercial of his movies, so far. Even though it has it's wonderful parts (SB&J are brilliant funny actors, Ben Affleck & Matt Dillion are in it as well, but I think they just had them in it to make it more successful), it did better than it deserved. All his other movies, like CLERKS, were completely brilliant. But that is a far cry from this one. I mean I enjoyed it some but I didn't respect it. Come on the villians were angels and hockey players. BUt I still liked it. And it was pretty cool that GOD was a woman, Alanis Morsette. The movie starts out great and then just gets stupid. WARNING: it's a joke movie, have fun and don't take it seriously. It's probabaly recommended for non-christians and people who like Chasing Amy & Clerks (if you haven't seen those, see 'em.)"
1,what a stupid movie,i saw this movie i should have brought with me my pillow and my blanket the movie was so bad i walked out of the movie holding my nose i should stayed at home and bored my self to sleep my friend thought that this was a poor excause for a movie he said that it stunk even when we walked out we said why did we spend the money for this i should have saved my money and bought baseball cards and i dont buy baseball cards
1,"A Kevin Smith fan, but I was left out of this one.","I've always been a fan of Smith's movies. I was looking forward to seeing Dogma, especially curious around all the controversy. I wish I could say I was offended, but instead, I just didn't get it nor think it was funny. It was just one run on sentace of a joke that I never got to begin with. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up with the Jesus religion, and instead grew up with the old testament and torah. My catholic friend's who disliked Catholic school liked it, but again, I felt it was their inside joke that I was on the outside of. I look forward to seeing the next one Kevin. thank you."
1,A Bad Joke,"What a worthless, childish and pretentious movie. It`s supposed to be a satire on catholicism, but is such an inane film that I almost felt pity for it. So this is what a hip, clever, witty movie should be nowadays, eh? Well, in fact it`s just a lame mess. The beginning isn`t bad, Damon and Affleck have a couple of entertaining scenes with some black humour, but it doesn`t last for too long and soon falls into mediocrity. The film seems endless and gets worse from scene to scene. In the end, ""Dogma"" is a failed parody with a few decent moments and a lot of crap. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the acting bland and the direction shows little creativity. While it's strange, different and offbeat, it doesn`t qualify as being actually something worthwhile and poignant. A letdown."
2,Wreckless Abandon - It's a long way from Clerks,"This movie would not have been so terrible if it was not supposed to be in line with the Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy series. To those of us that truly enjoyed Clerks, there is no low budget elegance about this one. There is no absence of the mainstream media explosion that you find in the other three (okay, maybe two, but we'll forgive Chasing Amy). This movie may have ranked a four, but not tied to one of the best movie series ever. It's like teats on a bull, it just don't belong."
5,another kevin smith masterpiece,"Just like Mallrats, the cover kicks ass!!! The special features in this dvd isn't too shaby either. Theres not really much of a featurette, but it includes over an hour of deleted scenes. This movie makes you think. The best scenes are between Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. I can't believe I mentioned Ben Affleck and a ""good scene"" together in the same sentance. The only films he's ever good in are Kevin Smith movies. Jay and Silent Bob are funny in this too. The weird thing about this movie is knowing what to classify it under. Comedy? Drama? Action? You need to see this movie!!!!!and buy it....."
5,BEST MOVIE!,"This is the best movie that I have every seen! It is worth every penny, and this won't kill you to see it! I WANT EVERYONE TO SEE THIS MOVIE! I am very tired of people putting this movie down, I guarantee if you see it you will love it! Snoogins!"
2,BORNING,This was a DUMB movie no point ot it at all. A completely A list cat wasted in thie trash of a movie.on dvd no good extrasrental only! 1DOgma C-
2,Disappointing,"I think people liked this movie because they thought it was rebellious but still somehow true. I tried really hard to like it because I like ""Clerks"" and ""Chasing Amy"" VERY much. I was disappointed. I just didn't think it was all that funny, and the premise seemed strained. It was hard to suspend disbelief. As a comment on Catholicism, incidentally, it isn't even close. I would describe myself as a Catholic estranged from the Catholic church. I used to be very devout. The movie didn't offend me. It just seemed like it was made by someone who seems to be a Catholic-without-a-clue. Take it from one who knows."
4,A Very Clever Film,"Anyone who thinks this is a serious attack on religion missed the point. It is a clever, funny and insightful look at faith. My neighbor thought it was weird and couldn't follow it, so if car chases are your thing avoid this. The casting was brilliant. The last Scion works at an abortion clinic. Cardinal Glick is George Carlin. God is Alanis Morrisette !!! It is just witty and pokes some fun at religion but is is not offensive. The directing is a bit scattered and confusing so view each scene individually, but strap on your sense of humor before"
1,Save your money,"I bought this due to the cast. I thought, Gee- with a cast like this, how bad can it be. Answer- awfully bad...terrible, in fact. I've heard so many people rave about this flick, I thought I had to check it out...I was wrong. Word to the wise, save your hard earned cash- buy something funny.Linda Fiorentino- whom I adore, was awful. The problem isn't her acting, it's just that the dialogue is so poorly written that it seems to be a struggle for her to pull it off with any creditability or conviction. It's just too over the top.The rest of the cast played their parts as ok as could be expected, especially considering the terrible lines. I just couldn't force myself to find this film funny- no matter how hip indie film lovers found it.In sum, ridiculous story, strained dialogue and performances, and the humor was somewhat predictable- like Beavis and Butthead hijinks. Save your money."
5,Favorite movie and favorite dvd,"My favorite movie from one of my favorite writer/directors, is also my favorite dvd. this two disk set is packed with extra features, two commentary tracks and tons of deleted scenes, with an introduction to each by kevin smith himself. the movie itself is filled with both comedy and drama, similar to chasing amy, and again, the balance is excellent. the comedy in this movie has (except maybe jay's lines) definately grown since, say, mallrats, and was equally hilarious, if not more. the movie is thought-provoking, action-packed, and gut-busting. everything about this movie is great. it is also not in any way blasphemous no matter what some of the right-wing christians may say. i loved this movie, and would reccomend to anyone to see it as soon as you can."
2,We couldn't wait for the special edition??,"Kevin Smith's DVDs are not just movies with a few special features, they act as an archive of the hard work and pleasure that went into each of his first threee movies. The Special Edition disks for ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"" and ""Chasing Amy"" are what all DVDs SHOULD BE - a record of not only the artistry, but of the personalities that created the art. In each we understand how the director thinks, feels and works and has been a chronicle of Smith's growth as a writer and director. However, ""Dogma"" looks like it was time to throw the film on a disk for retail sale.The much-anticipated ""Special Edition"" is coming soon, and Smith has promised it to be a great companion edition to a sharp, witty and (in some ways) groundbreaking film. So why couldn't we just wait for this?...I am a great fan of the Askewniverse, and the effort by Smith and Co. to even bring out the Special Edition reinforces my respect for View Askew..."
2,Gory satire,"For me, this movie started out with the right amount of irreverant anti-religeous zeal, but then became perverted into just another gory chop 'em up ""road trip."" If it had stuck with the satirical humor it could have worked better. For me, it stopped being funny when the violence became explicit. The monster from the toilet was funny, and that type of violemce (implied but not seen) made for a better film. It is too bad that it deteriorated into a ""I can make this more graphic than the last movie made"" type movie. It lost points with me."
4,Irreverent Grace,"No one can be surprised at the complaints folks have about the movie, given that it touches on sensitive subjects and that Kevin Smith is not known for his subtlety. But I would ask everyone who dislikes this movie if they can name another that unquestioningly acknowledges the benevolence of God or the importance of spiritual faith. This film doesn't fret about God's existence, or emphasize Jesus' human fallibility like other, more serious-themed works that have offended folks in the same fashion. Furthermore, I know of no cinematic portrayal of God that shows His love for humanity and the universe better than Dogma does (and I can think of maybe one better way that the concept of Hell has been expressed). Sure, the film is over the top, and intented to be that way, but that should be no surprise coming from Kevin Smith. Ultimately, the questions and beliefs that the characters express are important ones, and the answers put forth are undeniably good ones."
4,The best bad movie I ever saw...,"That was the review in a local paper, and after seeing the movie I wholeheartedly agree. It is funny, brilliant at times, yet so full of overwhelmingly grade-B filmmaking that it should have made the movie unwatchable. To watch this movie and enjoy it, you will need not only a sense of humor about religion, but also a complete willingness to laugh at the movie itself... it cries out for it. Armed with both these things, it may be impossible not to like this movie."
3,Rather surprising flick...,"I rented this mainly to see what all the Catholic backlash was about, fully expecting to be majorly offended. But, surprisingly, I rather liked it -- although I really don't understand why Hollywood always assumes that angels constantly spout bad language. Still, I was surprised by the level of theological/philosophical discourse between Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (the fact that it was those two made the exchanges even funnier since it seemed so incongruous).The weakest part, IMO, was the ending. Alanis Morrisette played God as a sort of semi-retarded child, and things just got a tad silly. But all in all, if you have any taste for the metaphysical, it is an interesting diversion (and not nearly so anti-Christian as I was led to believe)."
4,A supernatural hit!,"This is one original script! It makes you think while it makes you laugh. The director is a genius and the cast is one of a kind.Even though the film makes a total mockery out of the catholic religion, there are some thought-provoking issues in the story. What I like most about the film is that the existence of God is never questioned. Let's face it. We should all see the funny side of things. The dialogue is quite silly and insubstantial -- in other words, it is not to be taken seriously. After all, that's what having a sense of humor is all about.Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino, Salma Hayek, and Chris Rock are all great in the film. The cast and the director are the true of force behind this film. Watch it and laugh!"
5,great family fun,"I'm sick of the the bad mouthing of this movie. It has a very positive message, promotes religion, and is funny as hell. I recommend it to anyone who is curious enough to watch it, and don't worry. God won't punish you"
3,It's ok,"The football is ok, but my laces came out after about an hour of use in the pool. I called Swimming Supply but couldn't get anyone to pick up the phone(called during business hours). I'd suggest ordering from Coop directly. They are sending me a replacement."
2,REALLY??,"I bought this item because I can not take an anti-inflammatory over the counter drug. I had hopes this would become an alternative to the OTC drug. I did not find that it really worked. In fact, reportedLY, the Perine is supposed to help with absorbtion of the curcumin. I say, save your money and eat the real tumeric or buy tumeric tablets which are cheaper. No appreciable affect noted. REALLY!"
2,Looks nice but no longer works after 4 years,"I have owned this DVD player for 4 years and most of the DVDs I played on this device worked great. No skipping or other annoyance. However, after 4 years, the device is starting to skip a little during movies, and most recently could not play 2 minutes worth of video without stopping the video/audio. While the video/audio is paused, it sounds like the device is trying to read the DVD. I played the same DVD on my computer, and there were no problems at all. So, time for a new device. This time it will not be a Sony."
1,Disappointing...,"It makes sound resembling that of a 'disc rotation' as the movie is played. Response is slow; not at all a good dvd player to have. Do not get fooled by the cheap price,"
1,Died in 5 months,"This product is ""cheap"" and you get what you pay for in this case. Sony has made the product ""cheap"" enough to make having warranty service more expensive than buying another unit. Be aware that if you have problems you will probably be forced into buying a new unit. I will say that Sony customer support was great up until they gave me the bad news. Most support you would have to just assume your only option is to buy another unit!"
1,u paymore and get less,once again another sony dvd player with a superdark picture and all this precision drive 3 talk yet it skipped on 3 brand new dvd movies! and ive owned it 1 day lmao im very dissapointed this dvd player seems to be no better than the 40 dollar skip master by cyberhome its got a dark picture it skips on many dvds and its slow to load the movie and i know its not just me ive come to the conclusion sony makes junk on purpose to inflate sales numbers sony was accused by capcoms president of making playstation 2s with bad dvd drives so people would buy another and inflate there sales number i thought it was a joke until 3 of my playstion 2s all died my buddys sony dvd player had an awful dark pictures with ghosts and lines in the picture then it did 1 week later BEWARE THIS PILE OF JUNK HOMER SIMPSON COULD MAKE A BETTER DVD PLAYER WITH BOLOGNE AND BREAD
4,Sharp look at marriage,"I enjoyed this book. Gillison writes very well, and captured the scenery and characters very well. I found it quite a sad book, and to me was essentially about the Campbell's relationship and marriage. It's not a perfect book by any means, but I look forward to reading more from Gillison."
4,"haunting, searing family story",This is a moving and intense book. Good if you are interested in Papua New Guinea and even if you aren't the tale of the ill-fated Campbells is bound to enthrall you.
2,Not as advertised!,"It tasts fine... But I was expecting a 3 1/2 lb. beef brisket...instead i got five packs of shaved smoked beef. Not bad mind you, but the description clearly leads one to expect a WHOLE beef brisket... I can get sliced meat at the local deli... I was expecting much more.James Hatsis"
3,Bluegrass Country Soul,I definitely enjoyed the product but it wasnt exactly what I thought I was buying. I didnt like the commentary during songs and I definitely didnt like how they started showing the Country Gentlemen playing Matterhorn on the stage and then cut off it half way through the song.
3,Well....,"This, in my opinion, is NOT one of Shannen's best films, but is definately a must-see. It has a lot of sspense and drama that keeps you at the edge of your seat. In a way, it's kind of like a ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" movie. But in a way, the movie plots kind of repeat themselves"
4,A Case Of A Delightful Mystery,"Private investigator,Hillary King,is a smart and savvy gal with a big heart. As the mystery unfolds, she keeps up with the many twists and turns and takes the reader along on a delightful romp with all sorts of characters. When you finish this book, you will want to read another mystery featuring Hillary King to see just what she is up to and how she solves the mystery."
3,Not bad...but does not live up to the hype,"This is not a bad CD, it just comes off as being plain and lacking. Most of the songs are very generic, I was looking for more. Some of the songs are very good, like ""Access Denied"" with Tech9, but most are middle of the road. I'm not really into the whole horror movie rap thing, so that was lost on me. Those songs were just boring anyway, slow and dull...strickly for ICP fans. Some songs were very good, but the CD as a whole lacked creativity and innovation."
2,Don't buy this BOOK!!!!,"If you plan on continuing Japanese studies then do not buy this book!BuyKanji Pict-o-Graphix: Over 1,000 Japanese Kanji and Kana Mnemonics (Zzz). It contains all katakana and hiragana inside plus thousands of Kanji!And to get free shipping also orderPocket Kenkyusha Japanese Dictionary(the best portable dictionary I've come across)."
4,"Quirky, fun way to learn",I picked this up when I first started learning Japanese because while Hiragana was easy for me Katakana for some reason was very intimidating.. with out this little book and its corresponding kana flash cards I would probably still struggle with the Katakana. Especially the look a likes like shi and tsu. Thanks in part to book and to my dedicated tutor I now know the katakana with confidence. My only slight gripe about them is they give no clue as to the stroke order. That is something you have to dedicate to memory.
2,Might be better to buy Kanji Pict-o-Graphix instead,"This is ok so far as it goes, but there's very little to it. Also, this book is reprinted in the same author's kanji pict-o-graphix book, so there's no point in buying this book if you're going to get the kanji one."
3,Think before you act.,"Although this book was easy to read and understand it left alot out that I felt should have been discussed under this heading. It seemed more wishy-washy, fluffy bunny type of book than what I had anticipated and I was sadly disappointed after reading it."
3,If you are a GM you should get this book.,"Honestly, I'm tired of supporting FASA by buying sourcebooks, but this one has a lot and I do mean A LOT of useful information that you should need for your campaign."
3,Complete Family Drama,This film reminds me of all Rajshree films depicting traditional family values & culture. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Both Raaj Kumar & Rajesh Khanaa have acted very well in the film.
5,Most comfy,I started wearing these shoes after having a hip replacement several years ago. At that time the attraction was that they were so easy to slip on. They have the good support that I expect from Easy Spirit. I now have them in several colors and wear them all the time. Even the ones which have been washed frequently look good.
3,Easy spirit black/silver,I have several pair of this style and love them. I found these to be either too tight or way too wide.
1,Narrow width it is not,I presently have a white mesh Travel Time Mule in a size 8 narrow that I wore all last summer. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the same shoe this past fall again but in a black suede in a size 8 narrow. Both pairs of shoes fit perfectly. Now today I received my Travel Time white leather mule in a size 8 narrow and it is much much too wide. I am disappointed that Easy Spirit has made so much of a change in their narrow width shoes. I will not purchase this Travel Time shoe again
3,"Light & comfortable, but...","Yes, these shoes are comfortable, but they flip-flop against my heel, and have little side support. Too easy to fall off on a slope or steps. I'll wear them as slippers.The supplier was great: fast delivery, shoes in perfect condition."
5,Great comfort and style~,The most comfortable shoes ever - and stylish too! I can walk all day in these and my feet never get tired or sore.
2,Inconsistent sizing,"I visited my sister and tried her Traveltime and loved how comfortable they were. She had a size 6 and they fit me perfectly. I order a different color and model, same size 6 and to my surprise they were 1 size too big. I had to pay $12 to ship them back. If I had known about sizing issue I would have ordered from zappos instead and get my free returns until I find ones that fit. I won't buy from Shoemall again unless they offer free return."
4,Easy Spirit Traveltime mules,"The Easy Spirit Traveltime mules, I find, are most comfortable, and for the most part made well, with one exception. On every pair I have ever had, the inside lining in the back of the shoes always seems to wear out. The lining should be made of a more durable material. I would have given these shoes a five-star rating if the lining held up better. By the way, this is not Richard it is his wife, Joanne Lisiewski."
5,Couldn't be happier,This is my sixth pair of Traveltime shoes. The most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I am especially happy when I can get a good price on them.
3,don't like the mule,"Let me first say that I like the looks of this shoe and it was very comfortable to wear but I didn't like the way it ""flip flopped"" when I walked in it. I've never worn mules before but I take it they're not supposed to do that? I ordered in my usual size and it didn't feel too large but it just wouldn't stay on the back of my foot. I thought about exchanging it for a smaller size or maybe not a wide width but maybe my issues with this mule make it best for me to actually try it on in stores first."
3,Not quite the same,"I gave this an extra star because I'm a huge Teddy Pendergrass fan. Truthfully, his tragic accident has robbed him of the strength and soul of his voice. He really tries but fails to capture the spark that was so apparent in his earlier work. The projection in his voice is absent and as a result the CD is a pale version of the Teddy, we once knew. He still puts on a nice concert however."
1,Epic waste of resources,I would only buy this book if it was absolutely required by the class. It was entirely worthless in terms of writing software. Even if its required you can probably get away with using the powerpoint slides availabile on the web. I can't wait to sell my copy and free up the room on my bookshelf and in my head.
5,Delicious!,My whole family has been hooked on Annie's Mac & Cheese for years now! It's a wonderfully healthier alternative to standard ORANGE (dyes) mac & cheese.
2,Money NOT well spent,I feel like I wasted my money it started to lose me after a few pages and hasn't help me much when it comes to song writing.It's still sitting there on my desk and who knows one day it may come to good use but today......it's pretty useless
1,This won't be the answer for everyone...,"Please keep in mind that not everyone who tries guaifenesin (which is the name of the drug in Mucinex) will be cured of Fibromyalgia. I wasn't, despite being super careful to avoid salicylates. My guess is that, since Fibro is a bit of a wastebasket diagnosis, this will help some forms of Fibro, but not others. Definitely try the method in this book if you've been diagnosed with Fibro, but try to get it second-hand or from your library in case it doesn't work for you. Good luck! We'll find a cure for all of us someday..."
1,empty sales pitch,"I bought but put off reading this book.Something felt off.I finally read it this weekend and feel the author ought to be ashamed of himself.Yes, he says he has been through a lot.Yes, he has read a lot of books.But this book does not tell you how to do Conscious Healing.You have to pay the author money for that."
5,hilarious,"dont buy this if you are politlcaly correct, black or white. if your like me and dont believe in politcal correctness the insults are hilarious from both sides."
3,Pretty useful,"I would have given it 3.5 stars, but couldn't so I will round down. I used this book for a trip I had earlier this year. It covered every city that we were interested in going, and since that was the case, it lacked detail on some the off the beaten path cities. Overall, I found it to be pretty useful and we were able to fill in some of the gaps with tripadvisor and some other sites. There was a lot more detail in the more popular cities, which makes a lot of sense since those are much more well travelled. The hotel and restaurant picks were all pretty good. We didn't visit the more popular cities this time around, but the book would have been useful to have on previous trips."
5,I never really wash my car anymore.,"I've been getting away with using this duster and then a spray instant detailer for months, and the paint on my car always ends up outshining my neighbors'. It's important to use a duster so that you don't scratch your paint wiping off dust with a towel. Paint is a weak, soft substance and it is very easy to leave swirl marks, so yeah get a duster. It only takes a couple minutes to do the entire car."
1,Nothing but problems...,"This phone has been nothing but problems for me. I never dropped the phone once, but static will come on. To get rid of it, I have to flick the back of the phone until it goes away. This knocks the battery loose because it is not secured, just barely touching the contacts, and in turn disconnects the phone call!. I try to place the phone back on the base unit, and it doesn't charge until I hit it. What a piece of junk."
3,socks,"They work- reviewing socks is kind's silly-(unless they don't stay up or something! These do!) An assortment helps ""us guys"" too."
4,Accessorize your dog's leash!,"I was skeptical and at first didn't like the bulkiness of the Bags-On-Board holder attached to my dog's leash. But once I got used to having the holder and bags in it...it's great. No more stuffing my pockets with large shopping bags, no more searching in garbage cans for discarded cups or bags to pick up dog poo with...I always have bags with me. Only down side is being able to find affordable refills...which was no problem on Amazon! I order the 120 bag refill for $6.30 (so far) and have plenty!The only down side to the style I have is that it is attached with an electrical zip tie and the end scratches my hand occasionally. Bags-On-Board now offers a retractable leash with the bag holder built in...but I'm not sure of the quality of the leash or the sizes (animal weight) that it comes in."
1,Not easy to open,If you don't have a lot of hand strength it's not the right container to get. The lid is pretty much impossible to get off if the plastic is cold. It gets very frustrating to have to wait for someone else to get the lid off for you. The bags themselves are great though. I think the bone shaped one might be easier to use and will probably give that one a shot.
3,Convenient but doesn't last long,"I have only had this brush for a few weeks. I have probably used it on 5-7 cars and the yellow pad is all torn up on both sides of the brush. I like having both the pads and bristles but the pads just don't last long enough. But hey, I guess I get what I paid. This wasn't a very expensive brush."
2,"Jack of all trades, master of none","I have the Office Jet Pro 1150C--similar to the R60. Greedily feasts on inkjet cartridges, which are not cheap. Has paper jams and simply can't be trusted to make more than one copy at a time. Extremely picky about the paper used. I think it wants you to use the expensive HP papers, which are unaffordable in any quantity. After about 4 months of trying to make this machine pay off, I gave up on it. Now it just sits there...saving me lots of money."
2,Bad Formatting,"This kindle book was badly formatted, with words appearing cut off (see below).Example of formatting:""he said a blessing over her. Then said the maiden""There was alot of stories to read, but it took whole minutes to open the book. The formatting doesn't allow for easy reading."
3,Didn't look like in the picture,"This wasn't quite what I expected to get, the picture is different from the actual product, and for the amount I paid, I would have liked to get exactly what was in the picture. It's the same book, just not as nice looking."
5,Fantastic!,"My cousin let me borrow her Grimm's Fairy Tales book years ago, and I loved it. When I saw this for sale, I immediately ordered. It's interesting to see how these stories have been changed to make them 'childrens' stories. Very good reading."
5,FABULOUS!,"I love this book, it's so handy to have all of their fairy tales in one, and the old style illustrations are charming. Call me childish, but I never get tired of reading fairy tales. This book is also good bargain - can you imagine what it would cost to buy all of the fairy tales book by book?"
5,Great appeal for very small children,"I have a 14 month old son and he has been captivated by the Teletubbies for the last two months. We aren't quite sure why. Maybe it is the high ""baby"" voices, the bright colors, the giggling and laughing and definately the Sun Baby Face that squeals with delight every few minutes. My son learned to turn on the TV and VCR just so he could get the video going. Great for taking a shower in the morning, your 1 year old will stay glued to the TV. Don't go overboard, however, they outgrow the Tubbies, we are now on to Barney (I liked the Tubbies better.)"
5,Adults...don't try to figure this out,"I found it hard to believe that our 2 year old could be so amazed at a bunch of characters like these Telletubbies but he is. His face lights up when he sees the little baby sun. Tubbietoast, Tubbi custard, who would figure. It is the only show or tape that he will sit all the way through. The simple concepts seem to really help the 2-3 year olds. Definitly recommend."
3,It was Okay,The reason I rated this a 3 star is because instead of getting Here Come the Teletubbies I got LOOK instead.I could have sent this back I am sure. But it was in Great condition and my Grand Daughter loved it anyway. Yes I would recommend to order from them. I am Happy with the Video I recieved it was in Good condition
4,lost somewhere,product came on time and in good condition but in all the Christmas present hiding it was misplaced. so not sure if my grandson will like it or not.
4,enjoyed the Country Bumkin.,I enjoyed Cal Smith's country music very much. And was right. The cd arrived at the time. Thank You ...Robert Sanger
3,"Enjoyable, not great, recommend as a rental","This is a fun DVD to watch, but only because of the strangeness of the contest and the characters. The documentary itself is poorly filmed, and during several exciting moments -- including the VERY END OF THE CONTEST -- the cameramen are off doing something else, and then suddenly rushing off to catch the reaction shots, rather than the actual moment. I can't imagine why a camera wasn't left on a tripod and trained on the truck at all times, especially when there were only two participants left, to catch the final moments of the contest.I would recommend that anyone who enjoys documentary film check this out of the public library, or rent it, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a purchase."
5,"Good ""to go"" snack for small kids","Our 2 year old son is affected by Celiac disease and since his diagnosis we have had a difficult time finding snacks that are easy to take out on a play date or to a park. The ""Glutino Apple Cinnamon Rings"" serve that purpose very well for us and he LOVES them. They don't taste like your typical cereal that contains flour - of course they don't. But for someone who is on a gluten free diet and is accustomed to way the way that processed gluten free food tastes, these are a great, quick snack."
1,Homer Has the Right Opinion....,"This video game sucks. I never thought anything could make me hate the Simpsons, but this game is it. On a PC, you can't control the vehicles well enough to get a car out of a driveway without hitting something, which would be all right if there weren't a time requirement for every mission. Afterr hitting something coming out of the driveway, you proceed to hit everything in sight until your time is up and you've failed the mission, at which time the game asks you if you'd like to waste another 5 minutes failing the mission again. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!"
5,One of my all time favorites!,"Just as the reviewer before me, this is absolutely one of my all time favorite books! I am currently reading it for the 4th time in about 8 years. Each time I read it I find something different that strikes me. It is a beautifully written book, each word carefully chosen for maximum impact. It is a nostalgic read that will make you long for the simpler, but not uncomplicated, times of the past. Buy this book and enjoy it many times throughout the years to come! Mrs. Dabney will become like an old friend..."
3,Works intermittently,"I used this in when installing an Alpine INA-W910 in order to bypass the video/menu lockout. I do not watch video while driving, however my 3-year old is able to clearly see the head unit from the back seat, so that's why I need it.The unit comes pre programmed to bypass the Alpine, so that made installation really easy. However, when I was testing out the system, it would not work every time so I tried to manually program it; the directions were very straightforward and clear.My main problem is that the TR-7 is inconsistent in unlocking the Alpine. When I start the car, about 50% of the time, the system is still locked. If I turn the head-unit off and then on again, there is a 90% chance the system will be unlocked. The rest of the time, it stays locked (to my daughter's dismay) unless I wait a few minutes and then try again - once or a few times.So, it usually works, but if I knew it was going to be like this, I would have just wired a couple mechanical switches to do the job."
5,Works perfectly,"I got this for a Clarion navagation/DVD/bluetooth Car stereo. It was a real pain to pull the brake twice to be able to place a call on the bluetooth or enter an address for the navagation, or play a movie. This device can do it from either a single action (like pulling the brake on once)or just disable the restrictions all together. Also Ideal for an install in a camper or boat, it works perfectly and is very easy to install. Much prefered to the toggle switch method! It can also perform many other operations with it's programability."
5,A must have!,"Excellent product, very tiny and fits in dash perfect. It worked out of the box with my Alpine INA-W910. It gives me full control over the system as if the e-brake were engaged."
3,will be a gift,The items look nice and seem reasonable for what I ordered. Hope they turn out nice. I bought these as Christmas gifts for my husband. So I will not really know how they work until he cooks them after Christmas. Looks foward to that day.
5,Wonderful!!,Used these with the electric oil free turkey fryer. The turkey was delicious and the aroma while cooking was fantastic. Highly recommend
2,Just OK,Weber Wood Chips are OK. I've used them off and on but I only buy them at the end of the summer when they are like 99 cents a bag at the local store. They do give you the Apple Wood Flavor but because they have the Weber name they are over priced. IF you cant live without Weber Product them I recommend you buy them but if you have a choice get another brand.
5,excellent product,if you want to lower your blood pressure BUY THIS BECAUSE IT WORKS. I dont know what else to say
5,Love them!,"I started taking these because I was having heart palpitations and I was getting worried about my blood pressure being on the high side. Within 2 days of taking them, the palpitations stopped. At the end of the 30 days, I stopped taking them to see if there was a difference and the palpitations came back. I can't explain it, but it works for me!"
4,Great for Halloween decorations,I got 3 of these for exterior lighting around Halloween and they look great. They give off the real ultraviolet light that makes the whites glow unlike incandescent bulbs. The only reason i did not give this a 5 Star is because of price per bulb.
4,Great phone with good range,"I've had this phone for about a year now, and have had no problems. The charge lasts a long time and I can take it throughout my home and yard and hear clearly. The caller ID function is useful when you are busy and not sure if you should pick up the phone."
1,Direct to the trash can,"This movie is so cheap, sickening, offensive, racist, tacky, and without merits that it gives bad movies new standards for comparison. It's not even sexy. Possibly the worst movie ever seen and the only VHS that I've bought that has been sent directly to the trash can! Trust me, do not waste your money. Buy ""Billy Hollywood's Screen Kiss"". At least, you won't get sick! One star is given because there are no lower standards given. Take one star as a far fetched compliment!"
4,Good but should have been better !,"Very ambitious but to ""Picky"" No Marius or Grachi, Cicero etc. & other Priciple people who were responsible for inevitable evolution of Ceasears dictatatorship ! A little disapointing !"
5,A view of Roman history.,"This documentary is a great introduction to Roman history. It is not an indepth course in Roman history, as previous reviewers would of liked. Instead, it provides the average person with an a general look at Romes place in history; With out drowning one in extreme detail."
5,This is an excellent book!,"I read Beyond the Divide when I was 12. It is well-written and has haunted me ever since I first read it. Despite its intention for children, the book treats the hardships of pioneer life seriously and beautifully captures the coming of age of an adolescent girl. Because of the nature of some of the book's themes, I would only recommend this book for teens and above (or very mature younger readers). It is fast-paced and fascinating. Read it and you won't regret it!"
3,Primal,"For its genera its not entirely bad but I must give a heads up to people since amazon doesn't have a product discription. Essentially this move is a collection of striptease clips from various movies, there is tons of t & a but to call this soft core is not the case also the dvd design leaves much to be desired since it can be completely confusin as to which is which and whats what. Essentially don't spend more than ten bucks on this dvd, and that includes Shipping and handling. Although the brownie jungle scene on the main disc was worth it."
5,awesome,I've been trying to clean up my pond all summer and failed until I tried this product. One week later and I can actually see the bottom of my pond.
3,Lasts a while but then the algae comes back,"I have a small pond in my backyard. I have no clue how many gallons but it takes about 20 minutes to fill up with a hose. I'd say the size of a large bathtub. Anyway -- I buy this product because I don't know of any better alternatives out there to keep the algae away. It seems to help, but you have to use a lot more than you'd like and you go through it pretty quick."
4,MORE LIVE STUFF!,"Obviously the videos are great. But all the extras are okay, but there needs to be 300 hours of live footage to make me happy."
2,This was a present,Well im not here to write the best review for me but i baught this for a friend of mine who is into techno. He loved this unless he was just telling me. So going by him and his friends who keep watching it i would say it is pretty good.
3,Balanced review,"When reading other peoples reviews people have either said this book is great or terrible so i thought i should say what i thought of the book. First the good, this book offers two excellent sub battles that are just as good as anything others have offered, and the characters are farely well done don't expect ground breaking characters but they aren't just names and faces either. Now onto the bad, first of the plot has a major whole in it the size of an elephant but only people really into realism will spot it, the writer really goes deep into the inner workings of machines that while i was able to keep up with others might get lost in, so there it is what i feal is the best and worst of this book."
5,Corelle Sunflower Dishes,These are beautiful dishes and are of good quality as the name Corelle stands for. The price was very affordable and this design was not available in any store in our area.
1,Terrible service; Never did deliver book,"A few days after ordering the book received an email that it had shipped. Weeks passed, no book. Wrote to seller who pointed out that he did not have to respond until about a month had passed. More time passed. Complained no book. Seller again stated he had shipped. No book. Complained again. Seller admitted a mistake, book never shipped. Seller said he had book in stock, asked what action was required to make right. Told him to ship book immediately and expeditiously. Seller responded he did not have to send in expeditious manner. Seller unilaterally canceled order. After a couple months of email exchanges and notices that shipment had taken place I ended up with no book. Seller was not customer-friendly or cooperative. Would not order again from ""Michael Rubin"" or ""please-buy-mine"" because they accept orders but do not always execute them, and are not helpful to remedy problems of their making. Would have given zero stars if I could have."
1,Is this book made of solid gold?,I recently made Pat Sloan's Cottage Beauty quilt [McCall's Quilting October 2006] which the designer said was inspired by a class she took from Karen Stone. I enjoyed making the quilt very much and wanted more patterns using those techniques so I tracked down Karen Stone's book - but quite honestly I think I would rather spend that much money on fabric. Even Jinny Beyer's exquisite book is only $29.95 [which I gladly paid].
1,They got me !,"I'am gluten intolerant and low and behold it had WHEAT IN IT, SO I GAVE IT SOMEONE WHO COULD USE IT !!!"
2,okay,"Some stuff is catchy, I especially like ""Disappear"", but mostly they sound the same as as myriad of other bands (default, creed, etc etc). If you like that stuff you'll like this. Personally I've had more than my fill of that sound. There is nothing remotely new here...."
2,okay,"Some stuff is catchy, I especially like ""Disappear"", but mostly they sound the same as as myriad of other bands (default, creed, etc etc). If you like that stuff you'll like this. Personally I've had more than my fill of that sound. There is nothing remotely new here.This forum looks as though some intern at the record label was tasked with writing 100 5 star reviews: ""It grabs you by the throat and won't let go!!!"" ""This album is Grammy worthy."" ""Buy this CD!!!!"" I wish they'd find something more useful to do, like take the money they overcharge me for the same old cookie-cutter [stuff] and go find and develop something new."
3,Book is fine but the kindle edition is horrible.,"The book is very informative but don't get the kindle edition, it is horrible and almost unreadable with all of the typos!!!!"
5,Great Resource for General Info,We provided this short book for use in our new member's classes. Good resource. Easy to use. Quick read. Good information. Well worth the purchase. We'll use it again.
3,"Good intro to Presbyterians, Misleading regards other groups","Only problem is in inaccuracy when marking contrasts. For example, Baptists do not require that one be an adult to be baptized--only old enough to understand the act. And Methodists do not believe a Christian can become wholly perfect in love in this life--it's a relative perfection since complete perfection is not possible in this life. But at least he got the love part right. Most reformed Christians, even theologians, misunderstand the doctrine entirely. In fact, it is not even accurate to say that Methodists hold this doctrine since it is mostly limited to Nazarenes and other evangelical Wesleyans."
3,"Great sound, too bad it broke","This was a gift for my son, and he loves it. The sound is great, and it is sleek and compact. The buttons wore out far too easily though, and it needs to be sent back which is a huge annoyance, especially because it is so new."
2,not very good,this book has virtually no plot and i wouldn't recomend it to anyone. it has to much sex and to much talk. it doesn't give much detail about the outward apperances and all i had to rely on was the pictures in the middle of the book
3,Operating System Upgrade Problem,"My HP Scanjet 4200C was operated successfully for 2 years using Windows 98SE. I upgraded my PC which came with Windows Xp Home edition. Windows XP does not support the HP Scanjet 4200C software. Also, unable to find a WEB site to download HP 4200C drivers compatible with Windows XP. What is my next course of action?"
2,Earplugs hurt,"I had a set of Speedo earplugs that were blue and yellow and very soft and comfortable along with water blocking. I accidentally left this set at the pool and needed to buy a new set because I swim many laps at least twice a week. These are hard silicon and hurt when in the ear. I thought maybe there are different sizes but all I see is one size. I would not recommend purchasing these earplugs. Right now they will get me by until I can find a more comfortable brand/version of earplugs. I hope that Speedo will sell the older version of the soft, comfortable earplugs again or a similar model."
4,interesting bit if info,This drug test will give a false positive if you are taking zoloft for benzodiazipines. I just thought you might want to know this prior to purchasing.
3,only received one,This drug test does work but the description states 3 tests with order but I only received 1 :(...... They either need to change their description or send 3!!!!
3,Colors of love colors of hopeless!,Gabbeh is a movie that carves in relief the terrible consequences of the way of living in those lands. It's hard to believe in this century we must assist this tragic event forged by absurd rules that can affect the destiny of a girl who wants to get marry.A crude portrait of an unexpected and ignored reality in the other side of the world.
1,5 Broken Springs 8 months later - totally useless now,Since purchasing this rebounder 7 months ago I have had one spring break and the bar that holds 2 springs to the center cloth piece break. There are 3 springs which are no longer attached to the rebounder. The reason I paid the extra money was for a rebounder I thought was of high quality. This has been a disappointing purchase.I've been trying to use this broken rebounder since it was past the return policy. Today on April 10th a 5th spring has broken and this is now totally useless. This is absolutely a product I would not recommend!
5,the best eggs to eat and cook with,Excellent eggs bought some for myself as well as my elderly mother. I will order more the the future.
3,Have not opened the can.. but troubled already,"The text says it's 2.25 lbs, and the equivalent of 85 eggs.the directions say 2 tbsp on powdered egg + 4 tbsp of water equals one egg.the nutritional information says one serving is 2 tbsp and that there are 78 servings in the can.what happened to the other 7 eggs???"
2,Great for pushing chalk dust around,"This product is really good if, instead of erasing chalk, you'd prefer to spread it around your chalk board creating neat swirly patterns."
2,Not great comparing to Melissa and Doug's other products,I have purchased many of Melissa and Doug's products since my daughter was born in 2006. This chalk brush I am not very impressed with. It doesn't take the chalk off the board all that well. It leaves behind an image of what you have written/drawn on the board and the chalk seems to fall more on the ground than it does stick in the brush. Maybe these issues are because it is new but I don't ever remember having to 'break in' a chalk brush. At this point I can't say I would recommend this product.
3,Works with chalk,"This product works with chalk, but does not work with the dry erase products. We use dry erase crayons, and it doesn't work well for that. I do like the size."
2,"This is a toy children's eraser, nothing more","I bought these because I was looking for a novel, nice looking wood handled chalkboard eraser for real chalk board or chalk wall use, but it was a mistake. These are small, flimsy, and feel like a children's toy. I'm sure it will work just fine if you're 8 years old and writing on a small plastic Fisher Price chalk slate but for anything more serious than that, look elsewhere. I bought two and returned them as soon as they arrived. Put in an order for both a Quartet and Charles Leanard brand erasers and will post those reviews separately when they arrive and I have a chance to test them."
3,This book is just OK.,"This book provides a fair introduction to programming with MFC. The text is easy to understand and covers a wide range of topics in a practical way without too much fluff. However, at just over 420 pages this book is comparatively brief with respect to other MFC books which cover the same topics and, subsequently, the material at times suffers from a lack of depth. It's easy for a beginner to lose the ""big picture"" since the author presents a lot of MFC functions and classes without really explaining where they come from. This would be a good reference for the more experienced programmer, but I wouldn't recommend this book for beginners."
1,Amoral & violent,The puzzle here is a intriging mystery but the extreme violence and amoral story line was a turn-off to me.
3,In depth... Maybe a little too much.,"I purchased this book in hopes of learning more about starting my own small orchard at home. While this book has provided me with more knowledge than I previously had, it is more than I was looking for. I think that in time it will be helpful in making my orchard a success, but for the beginner, it is a lot of complicated information. If you don't know the first thing about starting an orchard, this is not the book for you... Athough you will probably enjoy reading it anyway,as I have."
5,Great music,I loved this CD. Great songs in Persian and Dari. They were fun.How come they don't have any more?
4,A Much Needed Break,"A friend sent me this book, knowing that I love dogs...This book struck me on many other levels as well. Overall, I found it to be insightful and touching, serving as a great break from the relentlessness of modern life... It pulled me back to the things that I value most in my life.As for the length...it seemed perfectly compIete in the telling of the story...I don't buy literature by the pound."
4,Club LX review,Easy to mount and take off. Locking mechanism turns smoothly and will engage/rengage quickly. Keys cannot be duplicated by local locksmith so you have to be careful with the two that you get. Solid construction with a heavy feel. Unknown effectiveness on theft deterrance. I figure it forces the thief to cut the steering wheel adding 10 seconds to his job. My insurance claims adjuster and local police recommended that it be used in conjunction with other devices and not the sole means of theft deterrance.
5,Fascinated in Cincinnati,"Our grandson (now i year old) has been spellbound by Moo Moo Moozart since his mother bought the tape for him at age 5 months. His parents have used it as their dinnertime baby sitter because he will sit transfixed, staring at the TV while the tape plays. One run does it for most meals; a rerun takes care of a special dinner! We're not sure if its the visual effects or the auditory, but something about the video really delights him. It's become our first choice gift for new babies.T. F. Mulrooney"
3,An interesting hypnotic experience,"Glauberman has pioneered the technique of storytelling a different story to each each to induce a hypnotic trance. While this tape in interesting, I have heard others of his tapes that are more captivating. There is something about this particular tape that misses the mark, though I can quite put my finger on it."
2,"Oh, what a mess","Andy Lau is the scientist. Anthony Wong is his buddy, the cop assigned to protect him when leading scientists start getting knocked off in some unusual ways. Oh, and there's a dead wife coming back here and there to torment Andy.Actually, this film held my attention for about the first 45 minutes. It seems to be headed in some neat, techno occult direction, but . . . well, this one falls apart and it's not pretty.One last question: how come all the worst Caucasian actors are in Hong Kong? I think some L.A. waiters should buy a plane ticket and try their luck."
4,Rub Em Off,"This is a simple product. Use these crayons on a white board. It takes more pressure than expected to rub the lines off the white board but nothing crazy. Also I expected the crayons to be bigger, but that's not really an issue.If you want to use something crayony on a whiteboard, there is absolutely nothing wrong with these."
2,Too tiny!,I didn't expect this to be so freaking tiny as it said medium and not small size! It didnt look like that in the picture. I wish it was a little bit larger. I have tried to use it in my ice bucket but it can hardly hold 2 ice cubes maximum. So I am very disappointed!
4,A great love story that celebrates sisterhood,"Great story about sisters, life, death and love. The authors moving tribute to her cancer stricken sister is unforgettable and a must read if you or any friend or family member is going thru a similiar journey."
4,"Faith, the Yes of the Heart",This book was purchased because it was recommended for a course on spritualty. I have found it very helpful. The author uses language easily understood by a lay (non Clergy)person who wants to strengthen their relationship with God.
4,good value,"color is lighter than shown, but I actully like it better. It is great storage for off-season clothing, and it looks good on the shelf. You can't put anything heavy in it, or on top of it, and it doesn't hold as many winter sweaters, etc than I thought. All in all it was a good buy, and I am happy with the purchase"
1,Warning about Heaney's recording of Beowulf,"I do like Heaney's translation of Beowulf, though I still prefer Talbot Donaldson's. But this review is to warn potential buyers of the misleading advertising for the recorded version. Although it claims to be unabridged, it actually omits quite a few lines and even some sizable chunks. For example, he has entirely skipped the very important confrontation between Beowful and Unferth. I don't like abridged versions of anything because I'd rather decide for myself what is most important, but I find it especially troubling when an abridged version is advertised as unabridged. What he does read he reads well, making it a useful tool in the classroom. But with so much missing it would be a poor substitute for the written text. I give it one star, not for its poor quality, but for the deceitful packaging."
3,Kindle edition not bilingual and full of typos,"Caveat lector! I'm enjoying reading the Kindle edition while exercising, but don't imagine for a moment that it's the equivalent of the print edition. First of all, it's not a bilingual edition Old/Modern English. There's no Old English facing text. And, when Old English is quoted in the introduction, it has comical typos. The thorn character is apparently unknown to the Kindle cloners. Half lines are also not punctuated correctly. Bottom line: Disappointingly sloppy."
1,Beowulf [UNABRIDGED]--AUDIO CD is Terrible,"This excellent book is fatally tarnished by the way in which it was put onto CD. The modern translation, the substance (needless to say), and the reading all are great. My rating of 1 star is attributable solely to the abysmal decision to put this work on two audio CDs with no internal track divisions.Audio CDs, such as this, are generally listened to in the automobile. If, like me, you have an older CD player in the car (or if you happen to switch cars, like my children do in their commute to and from school), you have no easy way to get back to where the story stopped if your drive is shorter than the CD.The formatting decisions serve to make this CD nearly worthless--even though I have a forty-minute drive.Very disappointing."
5,Much bettewr than I remember from high school,"""Beowulf"", or at least parts of it, was required reading in my high school English class. I don't remember much about that translation (after all, it was almost 40 years ago), but I've always had good thoughts about it, particularly after reading John Gardner's wonderful ""Grendel"". When I heard that Seamus Heaney had a new translation of the work, I purchased it almost immediately, and I was not disappointed. It's absolutely wonderful! I agree with a lot of the other reviewers that this is tailor-made to be read aloud, and I did that a lot. Now this treasured book will be passed on to my son, whose background as an English major in college and an avid reader like his father, will enable him to enjoy it as much as I have."
1,"If you can't sleep, read this book","This book, I swear to God, put me to sleep in the middle of the afternoon. I had heard it was good (despite being written in verse). However, I was sadly mistaken. The plot sounds very interesting, but it is less intelligible and interesting than Shakespeare. Who knows, maybe it's just me."
5,Intriguing...,"Accused by some as the trecherous read and hailed praise by others, I found the Old English to be quite interesting as laid out next to modern day English. I, as well as those to whom I've lent it out to, have very much enjoyed this book."
5,Excellent :-),"This is a brilliant workout - the results are there and the instructor is great and you do get an all over workout too. The exercises are unique - great variations on a classic sculpting move (like a plank move with a knee movement that will not only get your abs but your legs too). You don't need a lot of repetition with this workout because the reps you do actually do are intense.She is friendly and encouraging and to me, that is always helpful because if you aren't geared up for working out or really in the mood to carry on, an encouraging and motivating instructor can make all the difference and give you the boost you need to keep going. I really enjoy this (and you will be sore for a day or two later) and recommend you give it a go."
3,Didn't do it for me.,"I think I expected more out of this workout. I didn't really feel it was a ""workout"" and never really got my HR up. I think this is more of a beginner level workout, and I was hoping it to be intermediate to advanced. I will be selling this one."
1,Dock n talk,I would not purchase anything from this vendor again. The product was not as advertised. Or was an seeod which does not support iPhone 4 technology as advertised. They will not allow me to return it
1,Waste of Money,"This works well for dry mopping, but useless for wet mopping because it clings to the floor and can't be moved around."
5,The Red Glove series gloriously continues!,"The Red Glove series has added another success to its name!This novel, though short, has a lot of life within its pages.Though the ending wasn't really a surprise, it was such a 'feel-good' book it doesn't matter if you're surprised. I found myself grinning during the happy times, as the climax built up, and getting teary eyed during the 'looking back' phase of the book.No matter what, you will finish the book and be grateful you have a heavenly Father that looks out for you ....... in bad times and most especially in good.Thanks Karen Kingsbury, for your dedication to providing quality fiction to readers that like a good, clean book to relax with at the end of a long day!"
2,tedious,"I've enjoyed several of her other books but this was just tedious. I liked some of the characters but the plot was largely predictable. The few surprises were surprises only because they were illogical. Much space is given to dense descriptions of irrelevant incidents.If you want to read a great Cherryh novel about a long abandoned colony world with a gripping plot skip this and read Cloud's Rider (or Rider at the Gate, I forget which comes first)."
1,Major disappointment,"Cherryh is my favorite author. I have read almost all of her books, some several times. I was looking forward to reading this book and saving it with the others. In my opinion, the book is boring with none of her usual tension or interpersonal relationships. The plot is not clear, the characters are not interesting and as this is the beginning of a series I will not buy the rest. It's going back."
1,Very bad sales info : THIS PRODUCT MAY BE UNUSEABLE TO MOST SYSTEMS,"This product does not list that you need to have a 64MB RAM, nor does it tell you that you need a certian Adobe Reader to read this CD. I have adobe reader #9 and a 32MB RAM. Only after you in stall this do you find out it is not compatible to this system. Thank God I did not pay full price but I still feel like I took one in the rear. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE BOOK......."
5,It finally makes sense!,"Over the years I've taken novel writing classes, purchased writer's software and read untold books on ""the craft"", yet each time I would try to put into practice the ""normal"" methodologies for writing a novel, it just didn't work. I'd become frustrated quickly, because the accepted progression of building the book did not at all mesh with the way that I think.I've had this book on my shelf for ten years, and finally cracked it earlier this week. By the time I was finished reading, I was so excited to get to work on my own manuscript! For the first time, a plan for writing made sense to me, and I've started my first novel with anticipation, instead of fear.Thank you, Mr. King!"
5,learning to put words together,"Steven King has done the world a favor with this latest, not fiction, just the chanch some of us need to stop writing on scraps of paper and get down to some serious writing. I have written stories in past years and submitted some, but after the first turn down I just assumed I didn't have the skill it takes to be recognized. After reading this book I am going back and start all over and continue to write. If nothing else I can save the pages and when I am gone family members can throw away my words, or maybe, just maybe, someone out there might read it. Thank you Steven, keep writing. Carolyn Paul"
5,Valentin,"This book is a must read. It is not only for writers. This book is for everyone. Even if you only write a couple of e-mails every day, this book will help."
4,Interesting reading,"If you are looking for a how to book, this ain't it. The book, looks at King's life, and the events which shaped him, inspired him to write. Still, in a funny, twisted way, (not unlike his novels) I came away with several ideas as to how I could tune my writing. You may not get what you expect, but I was pleasantly surprised."
5,One of a kind,An indispensable asset for the fiction writer! I have a library of nearly 50 books on writing. Most of them are garbage...This book is the best their is!
4,Good fun for writers and King fans,"There's really only a handful of bits of advice on writing in here, but the book in general is still good fun. The autobiographical bits are great, and the general tone and style offers some insights into King as a person (who generally seems to be a pretty likeable guy). Just hearing about the early struggles of one of the world's most successful authors is worth the price of the book. The moment when he gets a call to say that the paperback rights to Carrie had been sold is classic. If you're a writer, would-be writer, or a King fan, this is a great read."
5,This book is good.....,"....but the marriage is magnificent - ""I know it's none of my business, but...."" Read this book and discover the gift of love and devotion as it exists in the real world. Congratulations Mr. and Mrs. King!"
5,"Candid, invaluable advice; strange organization","I found the advice given to be excellent, honest, and very useful. It probably saved me from making a lot of mistakes in writing and publishing. King's language is clear and explicit. I like that. If he thought something was hogwash, he said so. No beating around the bush.His organization seemed quite strange and internally inconsistent, but I got the nuggets of advice anyway. That's why I gave this book a five-star rating.I had the impression that writing a ""how to"" book was alien to him. Also, he was in the process of writing the book when he had his horrible accident. It must have been extremely challenging to overcome his physical problems at the same time he was writing a difficult book."
2,Very badly bound,"This should have been called the ""cheap edition"" rather than the 10th anniversary edition. The binding is extremely poor; the pages are detaching from the bottom part of the spine after just a couple of days' reading, and I don't usually damage books.As for the book itself, well, King's style tends to the vulgar and brusque. He says some good things, but they are mixed up with a whole lot of rambling and self-aggrandization. I'm happy to have read what many consider a classic text on writing, but I can't say I'm any more of a fan of King now than when I started."
4,More Memoir than Writing Guide but very enjoyable,"I would recommend this more for King fans than for aspiring writers, but nonetheless I enjoyed it. This book was a revelation into Stephen King's personality and proves that he is much more than a mere master of horror. He takes his craft seriously as does he things like family, nature and baseball. Read this and you'll look at his other fiction in a whole new light!"
5,My new favorite book,I was completely blown away by this book. It is different from any book on writing I have read. I enjoyed the excerpts from King's life. What an inspiring tale of a writer making it - and an example of hard work and tenacity paying off.King's advice on writing is basic and to the point. He doesn't give a magic formula but realistic suggestions and personal experience.I recommend this book for any writer and even non-writers who want to know more about the real life of writing.
5,Mr. King...thank you.,"Inspiring.This book is a ""must read"" for any would-be writer. It is slathered with dos and don'ts, pet peeves, and anecdotes. It had such an effect on me that I really changed my whole philosophy on my life. I totally reevaluated my priorities, my dedication to the craft, and my love for putting words to paper.Please do not pigeon hole Stephen King and assume that this book has not literary value because of his preferred genre. This has nothing to do with death, killing, or anything of the sort. It is a love story of the most artistic sort.A love story about a man and his passion for writing. A thing that he loves so much, he took the time from his busy schedule to share it with us. For that, we're very blessed indeed."
3,A pleasure to read but not applicable to all...,"There is no denying that this book is incredibly entertaining and inspiring to any of us who are willing to put in the time and effort at improving our craft. That said, it should be acknowledged that his process is not going to work for everyone. For instance his stories are all based on ""What if..."" -all situations where the story starts on page 1. Some of us like dark secrets lurking in our stories. He also feels that characters are added to fit the plot. Many of us start with a character and go from there. He's very big on description, advising us to cut 10% from our rough draft. I'm a sparse writer who adds description after the first draft. May not help me but still worth the read."
5,Very interesting book,"The book is about 1/3 to 1/2 about his life and the rest is about the craft of writing and his advice on how he thinks it's best done. Very interesting as both an insight into a great writer's life, his influences growing up as a child and how those influences shaped him into the writer he is. He also discussed how certain ideas turned into some of his most famous book, which is very interesting if you're a fan of his work. Overall a good read for any Stephen King fan or writer."
5,King shares his thoughts in On Writing,"Whether you're a writer, an aspiring writer, or just a reader, you will love Stephen King's On Writing. A non-fiction work with two parts. The first is a memoir of King's life, and how he came to publish his first work, Carrie. It is amusing and interesting at the same time. The second part of the book is about writing, hence the title. King doesn't tell us to do this or that when we write. He informs us that certain methods are useful, and certain aren't. He tells us what he has learned during his life, and those are things that are truly inspirational. It is a classic book that everyone should have. Funny, Fun, and most importantly, True."
4,Decent book once you...,"...get through the first 100 pages. The first 100 are about his life. If you like King, then you might like the story of his life. I personally didn't care about his aunt, his mother, his grandparents, etc. The rest of the book is where the action is. I should have bought this used, so if you want to save a few bucks, buy it used."
4,"Not a King fan, but...","I'm not a big Stephen King fan - haven't read any of his books since middle school - but I found this really refreshing. His bio (the first half) dragged on a bit, but would probably be really interesting for fans. The second half - when he talks about the writing process - had some good tips, different from those I've read in other how-to writing books. Tips about where to write and how to approach the craft of storytelling that I actually have found useful. He uses frank language and a conversational style and it is a relatively quick read. Mostly relevant for fiction writers, but others might find it useful, too."
5,Essential fun read,"Why not learn a few tricks of the trade from a man who had sold over 100 bazillion copies of novels and stories? On Writing was a cool read; a little insight into Stephen King's past,a little insight into the craft of writing. The Best of Both Worlds! Funny,I think I actually WOULD pay money to read his laundry list."
5,Funny!,I didn't expect this book to be as funny as it was. I bought it for the writing tips (which were great - VERY helpful) but it's a great read even for non writers.
3,An invitation to write,"Say, how are books born ? or How is a man born ?Two questions intimately linked in this autobiographic writing manual. Teaching is the author's job, learning from life his source of creativity.Simple, direct, very (too ?) colloquial language brings forth a highly optimistic tone. The reader shifts from the question ""Must we suffer to learn ?"" to ""How can we get the upperhand on suffering ?""A refreshing read."
3,"Refreshing approach, but where are the boys?","I bought this book because I am a patsy for anyhting with ""frugal"" in the title. Yes, the book does have some drawbacks: Martha on a budget, and lots of neat things to do with little girls. I have two little boys and the ideas presented don't translate well. Tea parties and doll's birthdays, bone china and salt cellars are lovely, but my reality is dinos, mudpies, gravel in the pockets, and Curious George. Overall, I enjoyed reading the book and have used several of the ideas with success. Frequently, frugality is seen as austere, and strictly cost conscious; however, ""Frugal Luxuries"" presents an interesting perspective that frugality doesn't have to be austere and a little beauty in one's daily experience can soften the economic reality. I do recommend this book as more philosphical than practical application."
2,Packed full of fluff and extraneous verbage,"The author should perhaps try her hand at fiction. The writing style is so flowery the intent of imparting ""how-tos"" is hopelessly lost. After wading through page after page of Thoreau-isms I was fairly exhausted and finished this tome having learned precious little about how to bring luxury to my life without spending a fortune"
2,"Mediocre and dry, without much in the way of practical help","This book seems to have just jumped on the bandwagon of modern frugality. Many of the suggestions hardly qualify as being frugal. The author seems to believe that she is behaving in a conservative manner, but her suggestions imply that she has simply scaled back from a spendthrift one."
3,Good ideas but sometimes a bit unfrugal,"A good book no doubt about it. But some of the hints and suggestions seem rather unfrugal to me and more often than once i had the idea that not following a suggestion might be more frugal. Yet, some good hints for those trying to prove that living simple has to be without joys."
3,Works as described,The numbers are large and it works as described. I had some issues just finding a nice spot to stick it on as the unit was fairly large. The light indicators works ok. Still no replacement for the car's OEM clock but for the price it's unbeatable.
5,Nice little clock,"I stuck this on the wall right by my bed so I can see it at night. I just push the button, and it illuminates green. This is perfect for a dark bedroom if you do not want an electric clock illuminating the room all night."
1,Car Clock that did NOT come lighted,"False advertising -- should have listened to the other reviewers. The clock I was sent does NOT have any background lighting. If you press any of the buttons, you don't get a light either, you just end up resetting the date and time. Very disappointed. I could have saved two bucks by buying a similar clock without lighting, since that's what I got -- NO LIGHT WHATSOEVER, automatically or manually."
3,Please read this...reviewed on 3/29/11,"This clock is perfect at keeping time...I've had it several weeks now. However, it is NOT easy to read at every angle. I have a mini van and my clock went bad and it would cost a lot of money to fix, so I installed this little sucker. Keep in mind if you are in a truck/van, your clock is lower than eye level, and I cannot see this little thing. The light is perfect...you must buy one with a light if you are installing it in a car. I left it in the van, however, it's simply not functional for me. Do not get this if you need to see it lower than eye level."
2,Loses Time,Purchased this item last summer. Unfortunately it doesn't keep accurate time. Loses 4-5 minutes every couple of months. Very disappointed......
4,There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem - Philosophical Review,"I will have to say that I do not believe that problems are illusions or can be treated as such, for that is treating the symptoms and not the cause. I think what Dr. Dyer is trying to say here is that we do tend to make too much ado about nothing. Dyer presents love, peace and hope in many different ways to reach many different people. He is sincere and his empathy with the human condition is real. I agree that God is from infinity a part of us, rather than trying to connect with him.Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal."
4,"Excellent results, but user unfriendly","The results are excellent, but getting there is difficult. It is not at all user friendly. Even the directions are difficult to access. As a research chemist who has often had to learn how to operate sophisticated scientific equipment, I found it challenging to learn. Plan to invest in rechargeable batteries and another software printing program for the best results. If you are willing to take the time to learn how to use it, it will reward you with many options and great pictures."
3,A Mixed bag,"I bought my Coolpix 950 three months ago. I had a Sony Mavica before. The Mavica was easy to use, but limited. The Coolpix is extremely flexible and can work well if you have the time to carefully adjust the proper settings. Unfortunately it takes some time to be able to understand enough about the settings to use them correctly. These are often a strange mix of software and hardware settings. You can't be in a hurry to take a picture with this camera. Another negative is the considerable use of energy needed to take the highest resolution photos. The 950 sucks energy from my NiMH batteries at a surprisingly high rate. I bought a backup rechargable battery pack and it goes fast too. On the plus side, the photos are great and the macro gets you less than one half inch from the subject. I consider the camera pricey and a bit quirky. I hope Nikon's next version is less of both."
4,Great camera--a little difficult to use,"I also own a Sony Mavica and a Kodak DC260 so this isn't my first digital camera. With the 950 I found that I needed to read the manual with care because much of the interface is restrictive and confusing if you try to just ""go for it."" After blowing through several dozen test pics, I started to find the tricks to metering, autofocus and Nikon's digital simulation of shutter and aperture settings found on a traditional camera. The quality of the pictures, once you get the hang of using the camera in a particular setting, is amazing. This is the highest digital quality I've experienced with a digital camera."
1,WARNING: Nikon Coolpix 950,"Well, after having my camera for 3 days, the optical viewfinderstopped working with the zoom.Amazon is gracefully sending meanother camera but watch out. It looks like Nikon is having quality control problems."
2,Problem with Camera too,I'm having the exact same problem with the camera as mentioned about where the system error comes on and makes the clicking noise.
4,Gene Roddenberry's story continues.,"Another fine product of the Star Trek franchise. Humor, excitement, drama, yeah, gun fights too!! Love it.Cannot miss it."
5,Works,Works as stated. Clean crisp nibbles. Very simple and well made. I use it to cut brass sheet for slot car chassis.
1,Not good! too loud and slimy,"Had a petmate fresh flow for years without any issues, then had to buy this as last resort. It looks cool, but it's so noisy! I often turn it off just to give my head a rest. Reason for noise is that the filters clog up every week and it gets so slimy each week too unlike my petmate fountain. It's supposed to flow evenly all around the globe but it just dribbles at the back. This design blows. I am going to send it back to the makers and have American Express refund me. Not worth it, I've already placed my order for a new petmate."
1,Hagen Catit Drinking Fountain,"I used this product for a week. After cleaning it and re-assembling it and carefully following all directions, the pump did not work. I returned the item and UPS has advised me that it was received on April 30 and signed for by ""William"". However, I have not received my refund."
2,Had problems with this one,"I bought this from petfooddirect.com and thought it would be great for my cat. Unfortunately, problems were immediately evident! For one, the floor must be PERFECTLY LEVEL, otherwise the water will not cover the dome, and if you wedge it like i did, it will make an annoying vibrating sound from the pump. Two, my cat was afraid of it! He wouldn't even approach it. And third, which i thought was the most troubling, was that if you touch the dome even lightly, as if you're a cat trying to lick water, the pump would respond and the whole thing would vibrate and make that same noise again. Also, as the other reviewer said, there's no way it holds that much water, and you'll definitely have to top it off at least once in two days or it makes a gurgling sound."
1,Underwhelmed,"This fountain died in its third week. Even while it was operational, the cats displayed an amazing lack of interest in it. We'll return to regular water bowls which can easily be changed several times a day."
1,tooo noisey!,"My cat who is not a ""fraidy"" cat would not go near this! I tried to return it but was refused even though I had only opened it and had not set it up! VERY BAD RETURN POLICY!!! BEWARE! So I set it up....It spills easily and if the water runs out it says that you can ruin the water pump by running it dry so you have to keep checking it anyway to make sure it isn't spilling or had been tipped, So why not just fill a water dish instead and save [...] bucks? It will never be something you can leave unattended...so it is pointless. It should have an auto shut off."
2,Only Lasted a Week!,"We have had a lot of problems with the reliability of these cat drinking fountains. They seem to break fairly easily and are very expensive to keep replacing. Our cats loved this one, but after only one week of use, it is already not working properly. The water will not flow out of the dome properly even after speaking to someone at the manufacturer who helped us ""troubleshoot"". Update 2/16/05 - we purchased another fountain and we are having the same exact problem!"
2,Some insight -- missed opportunity,"This book is a reasonably good discussion of the dynamics of organizational change. But it does not do much that a really top-notch book on organizational behavior and development does. The major advantage of being topically focused on education -- the ability to focus on the mission of education -- is pretty much missed. One of the common pitfalls of school systems is to become focused on the environment for the professionals to the point of insufficient attention to the group at the center of school system's mission -- the students. Evans misses opportunities to integrate the theory and practice of organizational change with such core topics as curriculum, pedagogy, and the impact of theories -- either solidly research-based or faddish -- on the culture and outcomes in the classroom"
3,The Green Eyed Monster,"The number one reason I bought this book is because of Marilyn not Susan. I could give a rats ass about her life in general. All I can say is the Strasberg's are kind of a strange pretentious family and their son Johnny does not make sense with his trying to act intellectual with his big words in trying to describe Marilyn's persona. Susan is just a jealous woman who thinks she's better because she is younger but not as beautiful and alluring as M.M. When I read this book I had to keep in mind of sorting out fact from fiction because I have read better books. James Haspiel write about M.M. with more sincerity, compassion and honesty than Susan. His book happens to be one of my favorites and I would rather read his book over and over again than Susan's. Also, it is true about what Mark Bellinghaus said that most woman who talk negative about Marilyn are just plain jealous. No, I do not think Marilyn Monroe is a home wrecker either, but a good person."
3,floating device,"This device works well for my purposes. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a little help in the water for aerobic purposes or just to relax in the water. But it is, of course, not a life saving device!"
3,Speedo Aqua Jog Belt,"The product is fine, but the instructions did not address the one thing I bought it for: aqua-jogging. The little black and white leaflet gave a few exercises to do with weights, but did not cover aqua-jogging, nor did it indicate how to put the belt on or how it should be adjusted for best use. I've been playing around with it and have found a way to use it adequately, but I don't like how the belt rides up during ""jogging"" and has to routinely be pulled down. Nevertheless, I'm glad to have it and use it routinely."
1,big & uncomfortable,"I was excited to receive the belt. I bought the S/M size. I am 5'6 150lb. The belt was long enough to go around me 3 times, I had to wrap the long hanging end over & over to secure it. I have used other belts with no problem. The Speedo rode up constantly and after 40 minutes of had chaffed raw spots in several places on my underarm. What do they expect a truly petite person to do."
2,Speedo missed the whole point,"The belt sizing on this item was misleading. The belt was indicated to be 55"" long and I could not come close to getting it on with a 48"" waist. Also, this item should be sized larger as one of it's purposes is to help lose weight and it will probably be bought by larger sized people. I ended up fabricating a new belt that did fit but ultimately ended up buying an Aquajogger belt which has a heavy duty elastic belt and works much better as it does not ""creep up"" like the Speedo product and fits much better."
1,It was good when it woked,A lot of paper jams. Eats ink like water. Printer does not work after 12 months. Colors run. Paper comes out with waves from the wet ink. Slow. Makes a lot of noise.Buy a bottle of soda and chew on the glass. You'll have a better time!
1,Absolute junk,I bought this at Target and it was broken right out of the box. Can't find my receipt and so it is like flushing $6.00 down the toilet. Save your money for something better!
1,Junk,"I got this at Target because I wanted to be able to weigh some fruits and lunch meat. This thing is totally flimsy and the white dish fits terrible on it. It is also NOT set to zero. I have tried and it will not do it. It weighs terribly. I had 4oz meat weigh at 7. A 6oz sweet potato at 10oz. It is J U N K. Tried on different surfaces, with or without white dish, etc. It is not worth even 1 dollar. I don't want to pay $20 foor a digital scale, so not sure what I will try next."
3,Good-Not Great,"About the only Ventures dvd I could find so I bought it. All in all not bad. There's a hum throughout the dvd on the soundtrack which you notice between tracks but not so much during the music. There's NO information about the concerts, etc. Where where they held? When? Just a track listing. Who's the bass player on the 30th anniversary portion?? Although ""live"" it lacks the feel of a live show(s). Wipe Out is worth the price- both versions, although the father IS the Master, R.I.P.Someday I hope an official WS 5.1 concert DVD of the Greatest Instrumental Band of All Time will be released. Until then this'll have to suffice.It's a R n R Hall of Shame until the Ventures are in!!"
4,Over Priced,This game is way over priced. I bought this at the mall for 9.99 brand new. Go to the store before you think about buying this on Amazon.
