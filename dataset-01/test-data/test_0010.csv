2,no effort,"Nintendo have put absolutly no effort into this game, they've just taken an old classic and thrown it in a gameboy cartridge. The worst problem is that there is no save, there are 100 levels and you can't even save! So you've got to sit down and play for 5 hours in order to finish the game. At first the game is really fun with all the old moves and characters but it so ... repetetive it's not funny. With the exeption of a few buildings all the levels are pretty much the same for 100 levels. What a shame this could have been really good. ( for all those who complained about there not being a 2-player option, here is a code so that you can with the use of a link cable:- at the options menu hold select and press the control pad UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP. )"
3,Kirby #2,"This movie is geared for the under 12 set. It has action, adventure, silliness,and simple video effects. It was good clean fun and I enjoyed it."
3,Shredding seams,"Initially the sheets look nice and are comfortable; however after only a few washes the seams on the fitted sheet are shredding and separating, and the material quickly looked worn. Though inexpensive, I wouldn't purchase again."
4,Awesome cord rewind feature,"Once you have it, you'll never go back. Very powerful and useful attachments. Long cord and easy to use no mess canister with HEPA."
4,"Clean, Great Suction, just a little heavy","Overall, I am very happy with this vacuum and its great price. It has great suction and it is very easy to clean. Just make sure you dump the dust into a bag that you can tie immediately if not there may be dust everywhere. I really like the automatic cord rewind option. It saves you time & the extra effort if winding up the cord. The hose attachments are also great. The only negative thing is that it is slightly heavier than I was expecting."
4,Hoover Rewind Elite U5507-900,"I reviewed a million vacuums before purchasing this one, probably would've chosen a different one if doing it again. This vacuum is heavy if you do a lot of stairs. It's good on hardwoods but some debris gets scattered by the beater bar. A great vacuum if you have carpet only. Unfortunately within the first few times I used the rewind feature it failed to rewind the last few feet of the cord. Also one of the attachments that clamps to the front of the vacuum continues to fall out during use."
1,Hoover Vacuum,"Don't buy this vacuum for long, thick carpet. It's heavy and impossible to push on thick carpet. We are returning it."
2,Just another bagless wonder,"In theory it looks great, with the innovation of emptying the dirt cup from the bottom to avoid the mess. But in practice, unfortunately, it doesn't pan out - much of the dirt remains in the cup after emptying, trapped in the upper chamber by the filter. Just try to clean out the filter area without creating a mess. And after emptying, you can barely see into the cup area anymore, unless you wash it each time."
1,A Negative Star Product Beware of Hoover products.,"This vacuum has to be made in China. I think Hoover is in China. I have NEVER broken a vacuum cleaner belt - I am 62. Now I have broken 3 since the beginning of April. I called Hoover at their 800# what a joke. (They never answered my email initially.) The first person I talked to attempted to send me to someone 20 miles from me - they would keep the vacuum - they had no belts either - I would have to go back. That would make 80 miles - the excuse was they had to make money. I guess warranty work doesn't make ""money"". Second call to the 800# I was told they would send me a belt (I've already bought 2 for $4.99) Well so far two weeks later there is no belt and stores have none either. To order from the order sheet it says parts take 4-6 weeks. This is not Amazon's problem, this is a Hoover quality problem - a ""lack"" of quality problem. Shame, shame, shame on HOOVER"
4,Good but shop for price,"I have had one for about 3 months now. It works fine and I love not having a bag to replace or a cord to wind up (this one retracts into the vacuum). It's a bit hard to push on the carpet, though. So overall, I give it a good rating.What really surprised me was the $299 price tag. I paid $95 and got free shipping from Amazon in July (09). Who jacked up the price since then and why?"
2,Mediocre,"I loved this vacuum at first, but less than a year later I am shopping for a new vacuum. I regularly banged out the filters to extend the life, but nothing helps. We have two kids and a husky, so we probably should have saved longer and bought something more tough."
2,Keep looking,"This vacuum really never did what i thought it would do. I liked the price and the wind up cord, but this vacuum didn't pick up any dirt. It sucks, and doesn't pick up any dirt. It really hasn't worked in over a year, it never picks up dirt, and stinks. Its messy, and constantly getting clogged. Keep searching for another vacuume."
3,hoover bagless,Hoover U5507-900 Elite Rewind Bagless UprightIt is good product for the mony it dus its joob
5,THIS IS THE BEST VAC AND THE PRICE IS EXCELLENT!!!,"I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS VACUUM AND IT REALLY PICKS UP. I HAVE TRIED THE SHARK VAC AND IT IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!! I LOVE THE LOOK OF THIS VACUUM AND THE POWER. I HAVE MICRO-FIBER SOFAS AND ACCENT RUGS. I ALSO HAVE A DOLMATIAN WHO SHEDS A GREAT DEAL AND WHEN I FIRST USED THIS VACUUM, I COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW MUCH HAIR AND DIRT WAS PICKED UP. THIS VACUUM REALLY CLEANS AND I CAN'T SAY THAT ENOUGH. THE RUGS AND SOFAS LOOK BRAND NEW EVERYTIME I USE THIS VACUUM."
3,Very good for the value,Pros: Definitely very good for the value. I got it for $99 from Amazon with free shipping. Design and retractable power cord. Slightly above average performance. Easy to dispose vacuum contents.Cons: Difficult to maneuver. The power cord is not long enough compare to other vacuum cleaners.
2,"Great suction, bad belts","Got this vacuum yesterday. Picks up exceptionally well. The belt has broken 3 times already when it sucks up things it shouldn't (the edge of a sheet, a tag from an area rug, and a shoelace). Seems a little ridiculous that the belt snaps so easily. They are cheap and pretty easy to replace, but it's a pain and I don't want to deal with returning to Amazon. Oh well."
1,Wore out fast!,This vacuum was great for the first 6 months or so but after only 2 years I need a new vacuum! The carpet hieght adjuster is stripped so it is stuck on high carpet. You have to empty and clean the filter after every use and still just blows dirt around. I would have expected this vacuum to last me longer then 2 years!
2,A Headache of a Vacuum,"The thing burned through belts. One time I replaced 2 belts in one vacuuming session--and yes I installed them properly and they weren't rubbing against anything.My guess is that it's the quality of the belts--or should I say lack of quality.Even after two years, the vacuum, when ran, would fill the house with a hot rubber smell.The tubes were also prone to clogging and I've had to pull it apart numerous times to push dust clogs through so it would work properly.After two years, the vacuum just stopped when the motor burned out. I did us a favor.The cord retractor was neat; at least they got that part right."
5,Hoover 5507-900 Elite Auto-Rewind Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner,Love everything about this vacuum but besides the retractable cord the thing I like best is the easy emptying of the dirt case. The price was $104 out the door. Amazon is the best!
3,2nd one ok so far,"I got this vacuum yesterday, put it together turned it on and it started to smoke up like the belt was on fire, took it back to the store but since I purchased online, there was a little bit of a hassle returning, the replacement one is ok so far, great suction, tools, and the cord rewind is pretty awesome."
1,Broke after one year,"I know that companies design (very cleverly) products to go bad after a certain amount of time, and sure enough, this Hoover did just that after 1 year and 9 days. The motor overheated once last month (waited an hour and it reset) and then it just stopped sucking up anything soon thereafter (probably around 20% of what it once was capable of). Now it's time to move on to another brand... (MADE IN CHINA anyone?!)There should be a Class Action set up for us against ALL companies (& their products) with ANY parts made in China. Times have changed."
5,Tracys,"This was a great purchase. It works on what it was purchased for, area rugs. Assembly was quick and I'm very satisfied, especially with the price and delivery."
4,just what I wanted,"I am very happy with this vacuum as it does everything I need it to. I have owned a Rainbow vac for 10 years, which still works like new, but it is burdensome to assemble with all its parts when I just need to clean a small area, so this Hoover just plugs in and off it goes. It was easy to put together right out of the box and I like the weight and cleaning power. It is not overly noisy. All in all, I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a vacuum that is inexpensive, but practical."
1,piece of junk!!!!,"This product has great features, slick design and really was pretty darn powerful for the first month or so that we used it. Then the suction kept getting worse and worse until finally after only FOUR months of owing this product it wont suck at all. I went in and cleaned everything out and made sure that there was no blockages etc but it still won't pick up.After struggling with this for a while my wife was talking to one of her friends who also purchased this vacuum. She also had the same problem. Their version worked for eight or nine months before it finally stoped working.It's horrible having a product stop working after you've disposed of the receipt, the box and the warranty information.I'll never buy another Hoover product again!!!!"
5,Excellent vacuum - great deal for the money,"I bought this vacuum cleaner to use while I was living in a temporary apartment -- thinking it was cheap and wouldn't last long -- especially the rewind feature. WRONG! This is a really good vacuum cleaner. It cleans well, it is easy to empty, and the cord rewinder works!I'm ordering a second one to give to my recent college grad -- for use in his first apartment."
2,Sucks and spits,"This vacuum ""leaks"". It sucks up hairs and dust amazingly well. But it spits about 10% of it back out. The vacuum is covered with a light film of dust after using it. It doesn't pick up things larger than dust very well. It picks up pine needles and spews half of them back out.Other than being heavy and having a shorter cord than I'd like the other features are great - emptying it is a breeze. The cord rewind is fine. The attachments are great. But I would not buy it again. Alice in AlaskaHoover U5507-900 Elite Auto-Rewind Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner"
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I GREATLY ADMIRE BOTH OF THESE ARTIST AND PUTTING THEM TOGETHER SEEMED LIKE A SPLENDID IDEA! I EXPECTED TO BE PLAYING THIS CD OVER AND OVER, BUT TOO MANY OF THE TRACKS COME ACROSS AS BEING.....WELL, HOAKEY. SORRY TO SAY THIS, BUT I CALLS 'EM AS I SEE'S 'EM. I AM TRULY SORRY.R C HILL"
3,"Not 100% ""Nanny Ogg""","I think the idea was that the Discworld publisher had cleaned up Nanny Ogg's grammar and quaint way of saying things. Wish she hadn't been sanitized. Most of the fun of Nanny Ogg is her outrageousness, that we never know what's coming out of her mouth next, and it's always funny. This was too ordinary to really be Nanny Ogg. It was okay."
5,Eternal Echoes,A very good read. Recommend the author. His books are well written and provides a good basis on which to have discussions and thoughts.
5,Great story,This is a book that should be in every western readers library. It keeps you going all the time and hard to put down.
3,Another gift,"For the same incarcerated relative I buy all these books for. Wonder if they make him think of the great outdoors? - which I don't know why they call them ""great"" - I prefer an air conditioned living room."
5,Hula Girls,"Very interesting story based upon real events in Japan during the late 60's. I bought the DVD in order to practice Japanese listening comphrehension, but my parents, who do not understand Japanese at all found the story and the characters very compelling. Western people continue to adhere to a {Madame Butterfly} concept of Japanese women(i.e Memoirs of a Geisha etc.) but this film gives a more accurate portrayl. I enjoyed it profoundly and the film even has a ""Happy Ending"""
3,"""A READER"" WHO REVIEWS A WORK THAT","""would seem to be fictitious"" is fiction compounded. Can someone explain what I'd get for my money?"
5,New to kickboxing,"This is my first experience with kickboxing and it was great! I love the first workout but the second one is out of rhythem and the music is off beat. It's a very good 25 minute workout and since my endurance is low, it's enough for me. I use 2 pound weighted gloves and I'm never sore. This is more for cardio than muscle building."
3,Connections gave me some problems,"I don't use this for an aquarium, so my comments might not apply to your situation, I use this with garden hoses and that is the trouble. The fittings are not hose threads, they are pipe threads. The supplied barbs would work to splice into a hose, but they are too big for common 3/4 and 5/8 inch garden hose. I found some smaller barbs with big enough flanges to work with the ring nuts on this thing, so I'm good, but it was a hassle. Accuracy is good enough for my needs."
3,Book for Systems Theory,In my opinion this books serves it purpose. It describes the system theory in relation to family therapy.
2,No Funk No Soul,"Whats going on here?? You guys call this representative of Canon's work!? You're all crazy. Well ok, i'm being too hard....his hard bop style is diplayed decently in this collection, but where's the funk!? I'm guessing that Mercy, Mercy, Mercy wasn't a ""verve"" record, and thus, this record is lacking a whole part of Canon's style! For anyone who wants to hear Canon and his brother, Nat, rip through several hard bop and soul-inflected tunes, please check out ""mercy mercy mercy""...its live taboot!"
4,Abnormal Psychology & Video Presentations in Abnormal,A good for the understanding of abnormal psychology. This is highly recommended for the undergraduate study. The book is rather dry but does contain valuable information.
4,No loss of quality,These logs seem to be exactly the same as the ones I played with as a kid. I was pleasantly surprised as it's pretty easy to expect quality to decline as manufacturers figure out new ways to cut corners/costs.I knocked off one star because I don't like the roof eaves. It can be tricky to get the roof slats to fit properly and not slide off. I remember it being easier with the (egads!) plastic ones I had.
4,Recommended by my Yoga Teacher,"""Healing"" is the perfect compliment for a yoga session on a saturday afternoon."
2,Not the exceptional quality I expect from Sybex,"This book's TOC looks as if it should cover a decent chunk of the objectives, however, once you get into the book, you find that the amount of explanation for individual--and important--subjects is lacking.Also, the questions are poorly written, do not compare in any way with what I'm used to seeing on exams, and sometimes ask about subjects not even covered in the WHOLE BOOK!Lastly, this book is riddled with errors (Author refers to RAID 0+1 as RAID 5+0 by accident in several places, etc). Did anyone edit this thing before press?I'll not buy another one of Govanus' books...."
1,Unbelievable!!!,"I ordered the Sybex book because it was the first out, I returned it soon after. It is useless for the Server+ exam. Sybex really missed the point with this book not only is the coverage of Server+ objectives weak but the mindboggling anecdotes are simply unnecessary. Having said that, I have had success with other Sybex titles and this one is the only one I have ever returned. My advice is to not open the CD that comes with the book so you can return it."
2,Nothing insightful,"I'm always looking for material on comic book artists and how they do their craft, and it's very hard to come by. This dvd had some promise such as Eric Powell ( The Goon ) and Erik Larsen ( The Savage Dragon ), and I expected for them to share their experiences in their career, how they broke in and made a name for themselves, how they go about making an issue of their book etc. You get none of this. Instead you get some artists, most that have never been heard of talking about the allure of comic books. If your like me and your looking for a documentary on comic book artists and how the creative process takes shape to a final product on the shelf, your better off passing this by."
2,Too little for too much,"This book is probably useful to a novice. It is long on simple minded ""lessons"" that tell you in excruciating detail each and every button to click, but comes up short on providing any depth. My copy was marred by having several duplicated chapters. If you have any serious interest in Acrobat, buy ""Acrobat Pro"" by John Deep and Peter Holfelder (John Wiley and Sons)"
4,Pretty great,"We wanted to get a ""disco ball"" for our daughter's room (5 year old) because she likes to dance to her music in there. This seems fine so far, quality is what you'd expect. The light it puts out is pretty bright and produces a very impressive ""disco ball"" effect. She loves it. The ball is about the size of a soccer ball, maybe a bit smaller.My only complaint is that it's really just a bit expensive for what it is. But obviously that didn't prevent me from buying it. I looked around online and I decided to pay a bit more through Amazon that use a vendor I wasn't familiar with."
4,NOT BAD,NOT BAD..it is bright and alot bigger than i thought...(its the size of a mens basketball)....it turns but likes to stop or slow down some.... and doesnt work upsid down.....(but its not really meant to).... you can take it apart and adjust the gears yourself...overall it works well for what its designed to do....which is put cool bright disco lights all over your walls and ceiling...and is bright enough to light up a even a 30x30ft room nicely....
2,the main seam was separated,"after i recieved the product, the main seam was seperated on the ball, the little colored lenses were rattleing around inside the ball.. took some time to fish them out of the ball.... so yeah it was defenatly broken when i got it.."
3,Not what you might think,Very small (short) and not a good quality wood. Just OK but value is questionable. Look to a better quality product.
2,Please stop.,"I'm on page 91, and I don't think I'll finish this rambling babble. The writing is some sort of self inflicted psycho-therapy, and we are in the chair, next to the couch, tapping a foot, looking at the clock."
4,Better than any plastic fort !,"We bought the tepee because we were sick of looking at all the bright plastic toys in the house. We have three boys who love it, ranging in age from 3-9. Everytime someone under 12 enters our house they head for the tepee. It is always a conversation piece for the adults. My three year old ""sneaks"" in to take a break from his brothers and catch a nap. This has been one thing we haven't regretted."
4,A reasonable film,"A very reasonable film that treads on multiple cultural taboos. What does it mean to live in a truly free society and whether we truly have free speech? In what some consider crossing that line, a professor burns an American flag at the beginning of the film. His struggle to retain his professorship sets the background for the main focus of the film - the struggles of a twenty-something couple in the doldrums to reinvigorate their relationship by brining in a third - an always challenging situation.The film is more to entertain than truly deep analysis of two interesting questions, but worth a watch."
1,"bad screenplay with cliched storyline, poor dialog, cast, directing...","nothing good here. need iron-will patience to sit through watching this multi-cliched bad movie. meaty faced married teaching guy met die-hard fatal attraction long-faced female student from spain, and he just got his 2nd wedding anniversary? boring dialog, bad casting and performances....so, what else is new? do we need one more of this cliched movie imaging on the big screen or straight to the dvd rentals? guess not. thought provoking? definitely not."
5,Voted Best Non Fiction 2005,This was a great book! It was wonderful to read about Stevie's mother and her struggles through the years. I grew up listening to Stevie having parents who saw his show a few times. I learned things I never knew about Stevie and his life. I highly suggest this book.
1,A disappointment!,"The quality of the CD is not great. That, in itself, would not be terrible, but most of the selections were not well sung. I was very surprised. The reason I bought it was that I heard the song ""I Put A Spell On You"" on a dance show. I had never heard the song before, but I really liked it. Maybe I was caught up with the dancing and the music just enhanced it. The rest of the CD was not very good. Sorry, Nina."
2,Sorry...,Didn't care for this book. Quit reading it and deleted it from my Kindle. I found it very boring.
4,Awesome game,"If you like action and great moves, then this is your game. The game is entertaining and definitely worth the money. I would recommend this game to all who love fighting games."
3,"Lots of info, little applicability","I love the head first series but IMO this is the worst of them. But that's not bad, this one is still great. The problem with this book is it gives you soooooo much info before it lets you apply it.Here's a real book example: There are like 3 chapters that talk about Entity Beans. But it doesn't explain how to build the deployment descriptor until chapter 3! How much are you going to be able to remember if every page has 2-3 concepts on it and you can't use any of them until you've read ~100 pages?That being said, is there a better book out there to help you start learning EJBs? I highly doubt it. What i'm saying is this book is great, but it could be better."
2,One of the worst computer books ever,"Some people may like this strange format of the book, but I really hated it. It's confusing, and not clear. It tries to be funny, but no, it's not. Too many unnecessary pictures/photos. You won't be able to use this book as a reference either. Waste of money. I only bought this book because it was the only EJB cert. book available at that time."
5,Must read Book on EJB,This is one of the greatest books I read on EJB.Although this lacks few good complete examples I would give this 5 stars.This is really helpful for passing the exam.All the tutors who teach Java and EJB must follow the Head First series.http://psiriwardena.blogspot.com/
2,Book is Out of Date for EJB 3.,"This book is out-of date. It does not cover EJB 3 which is the current paradigm. For EJB 1 & 2 it is a good book, but these are not used. If you are preparing for SCBCD this is not the book to use"
3,For Begginers Only!,Not what i had expected.Its NOT ATall for serious developers (what a joke).Books by Ed Roman and Richard Haefel are much better even for begginers.I am going to return mine today.
2,Disappointing -- confusing with lots of jargon,"Had high hopes for the book, with cartoons and all. But they got into lots of agonizingly boring technical detail without putting it into a clear context. The explanations could have been much clearer by providing that context."
1,mumbo-jumbo,Got this book at a stall. What a load of mumbo-jumbo cobbled together from plagiarised bits of other books. He sure has got some wierd ideas about celts. celts don't use crystals. who does he think he is. hey man - how about visiting a celtic country once in ur life?? get real
5,"Great as all of Verve ""Best of the Song Books""","Since I discovered Ella & Louis my ""musical life"" has never been the same. This is the kind of music that makes me wonder how I could have lived so long without. Ella's voice is magic. All of the Best of Verve Songbooks CDs are pure magic. If you like old-fashioned jazz, and you like great voices, you should buy at least 4 or 5 of Ella and/or Louis Armstrong's CDs. Just listen to the audio samples on Amazon.com, and you will find out why, in case you don't know how great they were. These guys were fantastic artists. They should have had 500 more years to live on this planet, and make it a better place with their voices."
5,A level of unsurpassed synergy,"The Composers, the singer, the musicians, the arrangers, each achieved the highest levels of performance on their own. Combined they achieved a level of synergy unsurpassed in the history of American popular music."
1,This book is a popular delusion,"The most boring book ever. No theory, no ideas, just page after page of stuff you already know. There is almost 200 pages on Alchemist. Nuff said."
3,"First 100 pages good, but the rest of the book was slow","I recommend Edward Chancellor's ""Devil Take the Hindmost"" instead of this book. I enjoyed this book for first hundred pages (financial speculation), but I was not interested in the later sections of the book."
1,THIS ISN'T THE BOOK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.,"This book is a thin, thin, flimsy 98 page excerpt of the real 778 pagesbook. Don't buy it.It is a flimsy thin paperback. IT IS NOT A HARDCOVER. AMAZON HAS IT LISTED WRONGLY."
3,What do you expect?,"Note that this is a sequel, not Flash's original adventures. The audio and video quality were adequate for something this old, but the special effects were laughable. Buster Crabbe was impressive, if the plot wasn't."
3,Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe- The complete Saturday Morning Serial,It is fun to see how bad the acting really was in these serials. The special effects are also enjoyable. Campy in the same way as the TV version of Batman and Robin.
4,Groovy Rules,"Retro-sixties combined with spiritual experimental music lives audibly in the music of Groovy Judy. ""Hey Dad"", it makes you wonder about the story behind the girl who wrote this tribute to her Dad. Never underestimate the impacte a father makes on a daughters life! ""What do You Want"" take note of the funk and grove guitar work of Judy as song swings back and fourth between sections from funk to Gospel. I feel a little nostalgic for a time I am too young to remember, sort of, well almost too young. Female Role models in the guitar world a far and few between. I am sure Hendrix would be proud of this brave young woman who is an inspiration all of us girls with guitars who love great funky guitar riffs and grooves."
3,Scooby-Doo sheet set,"My 5-year old grandson was delighted with his scooby-doo bed set, but on a cold winter night when my furnace went out, I ended up spending the night in his bed. I found the sheets to be very rough and dissapointing. He doesn't seem to mind them, but for what I paid for them, I expected the quality to be much better. I guess you're paying for the logo."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this game with high anticipation, and I was greatly let down. The graphics on this game was awful. Yes it was in color but you could barely see anything clearly."
4,Tells It Like It Is!,"One may wonder why a book like this should have to be written. Clearly Lord is guilty as sin! On that cold April night he just didn't want to be bothered with a strange ship firing rockets in the distance. It was easier to do nothing, hoping everything would go away. But it wasn't so easy or comforting to deal with the blame that fell on him. How dare we blame such a responsible captain? But the facts are there. Reade goes through them step by step like a first class lawyer. This must be done because many still feel that Lord did nothing wrong. Like OJ Simpson's defenders, they believe what they want to believe. My only fault with this book was that it was not the thriller other Titanic books have been. It tended to bog down in jargon and nautical language."
2,NOT THE BEST MOVIE,"DUANE MARTIN IS CORNY, FOX CAN NOT ACT, AND JADAKISS SHOULD NEVER EVER THINK ABOUT BEING IN A MOVIE. SO WHY DID I GIVE IT 2 STARS? BECAUSE MEAGAN GOOD IS IN IT AND SHE IS A PERFECT 10. I'D PAY MONEY TO WATCH HER READ A PHONE BOOK."
3,It was ok...not that great,"This movie was alright I mean I expected it not to be good since i've never really heard of it. Duane Martin good actor, but as somebody said before he was tryin to hard to be a thug. Also he was tryin to be like Will Smith a little aint happenin bro. Vivica could have even been better she was still fine in the movie though. All in all this movie was ok, but also like someone else said it is a low budget film. Come to think of it one of the producers or directors acted in the movie. It was the guy who told him about B. Free. Like I said this movie was aight it just should have been more to the action, but in the commentary they said they only had like a week or so to shoot the film thats probably why it wasn't that great. All in All 2 1/2 3 stars."
2,Ouch,"So I decided since eveything was in such a hype of dreamgirls I would watch it.Bad idea. Has anyone ever seen movies like Cabaret or hell even Sound of Music?That is how you do a musical, not some horrible cheesefest of actors. I don't know about anyone else, but I am really tired of Jamie Foxx and his horrible attitude towards almost anything. By the time this movie started to get an interesting plot it was almost over, and the music wasn't even that catchy at all.It was annoying after awhile, actually. I enjoyed this movie when they weren't singing, but it was just painful when they were.Also it was extremely perdictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did, which makes it boring to watch.The only reason it is getting any stars at all is because of Eddie Murphy and when they weren't singing."
3,A Movie Too Good to be a Musical,I've never seen the Broadway show of DREAMGIRLS but I know it's been around for a long time. Maybe if I'd followed this story's history better I could've navigated the movie a little better...but I was thrown by the insertion of conventional musical numbers into a really good dramatic film.It's a story about music so there could've been plenty of songs but having the actors burst into song during some heavy dramatic scenes threw me off a little. It didn't have to lapse into that convention.Everyone was excellent. Eddie Murphy was outstanding. It's a finely-crafted film that left me wondering just how far removed it was from the real-life story of Diana Ross and the Supremes.
1,"Annoying music, untalented cast.","Dreamgirls is one of the worst films I saw in 2006. First of all, I can see why this picture wasn't nominated for an Oscar in the best picture category. And who said Jennifer Hudson could act, she would have never gotten the role of Elfie if it wasn't for American Idol. Hudson's acting so self-righteous and wooden, please tell how she won the Academy Award. Eddie Murphy can't sing and Beyonce looks like she doesn't know what's going on half the time, this film is pretty bad. I was expecting some great Broadway tunes but they are completely awful. The song, Cadillac is embarrassing and ridiculous. Stay away from Dreamgirls, such a pointless and idiotic musical. If you want to see a great musical then check-out Grease, A Chorus Line, and Chicago."
3,Too much singing,"Again a well- made but really slow moving movie. This is the movie of the broadway show about a girl band from the 60's that is based loosely on the Supremes. As I wrote the actors are really good but there is really too much singing (OK, I know it is a musical...) and it sometimes is not fosued enough on the story because of this. While at one point musicals were a Hollywood speciality, here they employ actors that are not all greatly suited. OK the women are great singers but are they actresses also...Anyway it is beautigul to watch but too long and some of the singing numbers reallly drag on forever."
1,Ever see 3 minutes of the real thing?,It would make you forget this 2007 reinterpretation so fast your head would spin. Movie does NOT catch the flavor of the 60s at all. Or ANY of the charisma of the original. Totally different. You now know less than when you started.
3,"OK BUT, OVERLY LONG AND SEEN IT ALL BEFORE 2 1/2 STARS!","This movie starts out strong but, becomes tiresome in the middle. Hudson is pretty good considering but, I don't think her performance is Oscar worthy. When I think of all the performances over the years that got snubbed at the Oscars, it's a crime to see this young lady walk away with an Oscar for just a ""good"" performance. Dustin Hoffman ""Toosie"", Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Robert De Niro ""Flawless"", Richard Harris and Robert Duvall ""Wrestling Earnest Hemingway"" even Sean Penn in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" oh well, the list goes on and on. It's an OK story that has been done before better. Even though Hudson's vocals are good, they are not show stopping! Rent it don't buy it. 2 1/2 Stars."
3,"From a person who doesn't like musicals, this one was okay","I am not a person who likes musicals. The sight of people breaking into song mid-sentence annoys me to no end, and the very idea that people would talk to each other in verse is ridiculous. That being said, I wanted to see this movie because I'm a Jennifer Hudson fan and I wanted to see what all the talk was about. I'm glad that I did. Dreamgirls isn't a cheesy musical. There is no moment when the people are doing something absolutely ridiculous but it's justified because they're singing at the same time. In fact, the singing supports the story rather than the story supporting the singing, which is the main problem I have with musicals. Dreamgirls was enjoyable from start to finish, and I'd encourage those who don't consider themselves musical fans to give it a go."
1,Why are the CDs blankk?,"I pre-ordered this 2-disc set and couldn't wait to receive it. The family sat down to watch the movie together on a Friday night, and low and behold, the CD's were completely blank. We tried 2 different machines and they were just blank. Thankfully, Amazon has a great return policy and a week later, I had a replacement set. And guess what? They are blank too! I've never had an experience like this with DVD's before. What's up with that?"
5,THE STORY OF R & B,2006. Written and directed by Bill Condon. 2 Academy awards. Third pseudo biopic in a row for Bill Condon who manages to describe in two hours the rise and fall (at least in term of quality) of the R&B record industry.
1,Blatantly Rips off Motown,"Diana Ross,Berry Gordy,smokey Robinson,etc... should be paid for this weak Movie that just takes everything from it. Jennifer Hudson pretty much steals the whole film. Beyonce ain't got a clue at acting. Jamie foxx is trying to hard and it's mixed. as for Eddie Murphy his many takes on singers and stylings feels like One of his standups,except he is suppose to be playing One,but he can't get One fully right let alone the many he is trying to emulate. the film is too long and it jumps all over the place and it's so cliche and everybody who knows there music history knows this film is about Motown. this Film is a Insult to Motown. that Corny Broke take on the Jackson Five really took the cake. this Film was Corny and a straight up slap to the face to what Motown Records Accomplished."
3,Not bad for review purposes,"I had no Frontpage experience before buying this book and managed to pass the exam after reading it. I did however, take quite a bit of time using Fp98 which helped a great deal. I'd recommend the book to people who already have an understanding of Fp98. I agree with most people that the sample questions in the book are much easier than the actual test questions. It also would have been nice for the Author to at least mention something about the simulation questions, they caught me totally off guard. Overall not a bad book if all you want to do is go over the essentials before the test."
1,Content is next to useless,"I took the exam and I passed it. However, my passing grade had nothing to do with this book. The content they review is hardly mentioned in the test and the practice exam is nothing like the actual exam. Save your money and review what you already have, this book is not worth $1."
3,Ok but falls short of the rest,The book is an overview and simply that. It doesn't go into enough detail on the type of exam questions. The book is good in that it will pin point the areas that you are weak on but you will have to go to another source to get the information you need.As it is the only book on this exam at the time it is worth getting purely for that reason.
3,"Imported, subtitled zombie movie. Not great, not bad. Somewhere in the middle.","This movie falls into the ""frenetic zombie"" genre, not unlike 28 Days Later and the remade Dawn of the Dead.It's at times frenetic, and at other times a bit boring. They never really define what the zombie plague is or whether it's an infection or something supernatural. But there's certainly more than enough action and zombie gross-outs for the jaded zombie movie fan to overlook some of its shortcomings. The fact that it's subtitled and not dubbed doesn't help much, though.It somehow seems more like a rental than something to rush out and buy..."
2,Okay but not worth the calories,These cookies were just okay but I wouldn't buy them again. There are better tasting prepackaged less expensive sugar free cookies in the grocery store.
4,6' Frontier Tee Pee,"While overall, this is a really nice product, the measurements are a bit deceiving. The 6' measurement is from the floor to the top of the poles that you see sticking out from the top of the tee pee. This looks a lot larger than it actually is. We bought it to decorate and auction off for my daughter's kindergarten's project in their silent auction, and we really wish we'd gone for the next size up. This is fine for a small child, but hardly enough room for playing."
2,disappointing,The cut I had heard was lovely piano but the rest of the CD does not measure up. A big dissappointment.
2,it would be a cool deck,TThe deck is ok but there some elemental hero missing. The deck is complete n i put it in my collecting deck binder.
5,Healthy boost,"I've been using this product for about a year. Its hard to get all your greens in one day but not with Macrogreens! I mix it in my water bottle every morning. The taste does not bother me. If you put it in a smoothie, you can't even taste it. This stuff makes me feel energized and healthy. Some of the other green powder products have that ""scratchy"" feeling when you drink it. This does not. I love it!!!"
5,Great product,I always get confused though because the product I get has a green lid. But otherwise the product is great.
3,Not too bad -,"I found this too sweet and ""filled"" to really taste the fruit I would add to it.I made about 3 smoothies and threw the rest.But then - I really don't care for ""sweet"" and goopy in the morning... Otherwise seemed fresh and was delivered very promptly."
4,"Innovative design, bad printing","The shirt is 100% cotton and fits perfectly.The collar is a little too high, but it's just part of it's design, and not really a problem.The idea for the printing is quite nice and very well done. Having a ""broken image"" in a shirt can be quite entertaining among friends.But there's one letdown: the quality of the printing isn't as high as it could be. It's quite thick and brakes apart in little pieces. That can't be seen from a distance, but if you get upclose with an observing person, (s)he will notice it.Still, 4 out of 5 stars, because the idea is excellent."
3,OK but not a cozy,"An okay book, not really my type of mystery. Sort or more hard-boiled than cozy (or maybe a little soft-boiled). The heroes are tough-talking men who do some not-quite-legal things to survive the hard times they find themselves in. The writing is okay, although there are a few episodes that are more filler than useful points in moving the plot along (a full page about hands played in a card game could have been cut for instance.)"
5,wolf,This is a true story and is amazing. It also shows the corruption of governments that attempt to blame animals for human excesses.
1,"""Never Cry Wolf"" is fiction masquerading as non-fiction","""Never Cry Wolf"" is a great story, but sadly, it's a work of fiction that's been inaccurately sold as non-fiction. Mowat has never provided evidence to refute the investigations in Canada that uncovered the fictional nature of ""Never Cry Wolf"". For an accurate description of wolf biology, read the works of respected wolf biologists such as L. David Mech. As Mech says in his book ""The Wolf"", Mowat's ""Never Cry Wolf"" is a good counterbalance to the ""Little Red Riding Hood"" portrayal of wolves as vicious man eaters... yet neither story is grounded in fact. Among the gross errors in Mowat's book was his contention that wolf packs can subsist on a diet of small rodents. No wolf biologist has found such a wolf population. It may not be PC to say that wolves subsist primarily on large ungulates that they hunt down and kill, but it's the truth."
2,Uninteresting with a slow moving plot,"I recent read the book, ""Never Cry Wolf,"" by Farley Mowart. Personally, I didn't like the book very much. It was very slow moving with very little action and not many interesting events. The book said it was based on a true story, but really it never happened and that upset me. So I guess this book is realistic fiction based on facts. It is a short book that is based on facts about the interaction between wolves and other animals. If this sounds interesting, then read the book. But if you prefer sci-fi's and fantasies with action and adventure, then stay away from this book."
5,Truly one of the best christian novels I've read,"I'm a huge fan of Charles Sheldon. I read this book by E.P. Roe and was taken aback by how great it was, it rivaled Mr Sheldon's works in every way. If you enjoy reading religious novels you'll love this one"
4,Cool Game,this is a pretty fun game if you're in the mood just to destroy tuff. there really is nothing to this just destroying buildings. it get boring in a while but it's fun.
4,it's really 4 and 1/2 stars,"Jeff Shannon in the editorial review really does justice to this movie in his 3 paragraphs.the ""Reviewer: A viewer from Miami, Florida"" misses the point. you don't compare this movie to ""reality"" to validate its value--you don't do that with most art/holywood movies either.the big strength of this movie is its artistic representation of what happens in real life: how one entraps onself in a given situation and then meaning is generated anew. this is a very human(istic) characteristic present throughout our history.i am retaining 1/2 of a star for the not so smooth technical realization of this great movie. as for the eroticism lable slaped throughout you may well ignore it."
4,720,"This game is amazing, wether its a backwards flip or a nose grab you perform, the excitement just keeps on cooming. A must for ""Extreme Sports"" lovers."
3,720 Skateboarding,"A solid skateboarding game. You are in Skate City where there are four parks, Half-Pipe, Downhill, Slolom, and Ramp. You earn points and money for performing tricks inside the parks and in the city itself. Upgrades to your skateboard can be purchased. All in all the game is entertaining but lacks replay value after you master the technique."
1,What was i thinking?,I bought this game because it seemed like a pretty cool product. I was wrong! This game is not thrilling and it just doesn't seem to have a point. What were they thinking when they made this game? I sold mine because it was just useless to me. I didn't get very much but anything was better than keeping it around.
3,Its really old but its still a little fun.,"720 is a really old game that has appeared on NES and in the arcades.This version is just like those ones,but for a Game Boy Color game,it still looks alright in the visial department.Sometimes its a little hard and a little confusing for begginers,but once you get the hang of it you will probably have some fun with it.After awhile it can get a little boring,though."
4,A very good study...,"My small group selected this book to use as our focus for this year's study. We are about 1/3 through it as I write this. The book is set up in a way that invites a free-flowing discussion, which our small group finds very helpful in faith-sharing. Each chapter has an introduction, and these are tremendously helpful in learning the perspective and context for the book(s) you are studying at the time. There are approximately 20 questions in each chapter, meant to help you think further about the readings. While some questions seem a bit redundant, there are always at least several really thought-provoking ones, and my group tends to concentrate more on these. I recommend this book to anyone wishing to get more knowledge of the prophets and apostles, and wishing to increase their faith."
2,Good study - video weak,If I had it to do again I would not do this study because the video was so weak. My group prefers to have video with study and there are others much better. It is a good study if you don't want the video to go along with it.
3,A story of losts with no gains,"The story is about Duddy Kravitz and his determination to become a ""somebody"" by doing whatever it takes. This St. Urban Street boy follows blindly under one value, the only value, he receives from his childhood - a man without land is nobody. Duddy schemes and dreams to acheive his own property, not afraid to exploit others along the way for his own ends. This book portrays the evils of great ambition as Duddy's success is also his downfall in life. His lost of love and other means cost him greater than any money can buy."
3,Do we really need two of these?,"Duddy Kravitz is a story very very close to Budd Schulberg's earlier work, What Makes Sammy Run? The main difference is that Shulberg went on to tell much better stories (the films On the Waterfront, and A Face in the Crowd)."
3,SURREAL WHEN YOU HAVE HALF SLEPT THROUGH IT,"A strange French film. I saw it in high school French class, and, to be honest, slept through much of it, but everytime I woke up I would see strange things happen. The story focuses on a young French girl living in Africa. The tale is apparently semi-autobiographical. Among some of the strange visuals I caught site of when I opened my eyes, an African caretaker (a young man) gives the little girl a cracker with a bunch of insects that look like ants crushed onto it. There is another scene in which the caretaker is showering and starts to cry. The film focuses a lot on people's societal and racial roles and maybe too much so on the issue of sexual frustration. I wish I remembered more of this film. It is, I am sure, quite an interesting film with interesting visual imagery if nothing else."
5,Undeniabley A Solid CD.,"It's extermely rare when a cd comes around that meets your expectations and exceeds them. This cd does just that. A cd that breaks all molds and trends and follows a path only given to the artist. Sure the sounds are modern but All-Out Original. No constraints on this album either, Chris flows from one style and genre to the other and often crosses boundries within a given song. If you like music where the theme is surrounded around genuine creativity this is the cd for you! We all know how phenomenal Cornell's voice is, and in the category of delivering he doesn't fall short. If you want a cd that you can play over and over again, and doesn't die after the second spin, this is the cd for you. ENJOY."
5,I didn't buy it for so long....,"I have loved soundgarden since '95 so when they broke up I was just sad because I would never get to hear that beautiful noise again. When I heard Chris Cornell was going solo, I didn't rush to my local record store and buy it. shame on me. I heard the song Can't Change Me on the radio, and it was a good song, but frankly it just sounded like a modern rock radio hit to me. I suggest: listen to this album as a whole, don't give up after one song. I got to see Chris live, which was one of the coolest things ever. I'm waiting till i get to see him again. If you can catch him on his tour, you won't regret it. My favorite song is 'Preaching the End of the World', with lyrics like ""I'm 24/and i've got everything to live for"". 'Wave Goodbye' is also excelent, it kinda reminds me of Billy Joel. Flutter Girl has a cool intro and and is just an awsome song. This Cd is bliss, get it, somewhere, somehow...."
2,This is a disappointing debut by one of rock's best voices.,"As an avid Cornell fan, I found this CD to be somewhat bland and very disappointing. Cornell proved to be one of the decade's premiere songwriters and I expected so much more from this release. The music wasn't as ambitious as I had anticipated and some great lyrics were done in by suspect music. No song on here lives up to his earlier solo songs, nor do they have the inventiveness of his Temple of the Dog songs. I really can't remember when I've been more let down by a CD and only take heart in the fact that his next release can only be better."
5,Chris Cornell Has Outdone Himself.....,"Moody, psychedelic, bluesy, & highly emotional, Chris Cornell has outdone himself with Euphoria Morning. His wailing, soul-filled vocals are as beautiful as ever, & his solo effort is far sweeter than those with Soundgarden. Much of his former band's hard grinding edges are gone, which leads to a deep, smooth, heartfelt, artistic feel throughout the album. As ever, Chris Cornell has once again provided good music for the head... Euphoria Morning should prove a positive step in the music career of this ""Moonchild""."
3,Different,"I went into this CD, knowing that it would not be Soundgarden. But I came out almost wishing that it was. Chris' voice is still great and his lyrics are solid as usual. But I wouldn't put this disc in my car player if I was travelling for a long period of time. This should contain a warning label that says, May cause drowsiness. I was enjoying the disc as I was listening but I was just waiting for Chris to let loose or hear some crunching guitars, just once at least. Buy this CD to listen to during times that you want to relax and unwind, for these times it will seem like an outstanding piece of work. But if you are looking for an edge, it isn't here."
5,6 Stars If I Could,"Where do I begin? I must say that this one definately grows on you, but there is an advantage to that: it doesn't get old. And when the CD stays youthful, it stays good to listen to. Um, Chris is one of the greater male singers of our generation. His lyrics and style of fusing poetry to music differs from Soundgarden, but it is just as good. The guitar parts are complex. The drums are on time. The vocals are great. All in all I must say this is the best work I've seen him do since ""Sunshower"". If you don't own it, you had better get it."
5,Luminous and wonderful!,"I believe I share the sentiments of most when I say this is a welcomed departure from Cornell's hard-rocking work with Soundgarden. Chris Cornell captures something truly majestic on this album, and the song ""Preaching the End of the World"" is otherworldly. I cannot get enough of that song. ""When I'm Down"" has a cool gospel vibe, too. Overall, this is a great recording with stellar songwriting, showcasing Cornell's wares as a bonafide musician. ""Euphoria Morning"" is an apt title for this album and it's definitely worth checking out."
2,very dissapointing,"it seems as though chris is missing help from a external producer on this album. he doesnt just let it flow. it becomes blah after the first 5 songs. it might be worth buying, but it certainly won't make anybodies top ten list."
3,Better Off Buying the Singles Soundtrack,"I was a little disappointed in this cd (just a little) It featured Can't Change Me, adn I love that song, but that was about all I loved I liked a couple of other tracks like When I'm Down, but the overall cd dragged I didn't find much energy in any song but Can't Change Me Cornell is also on the Singles soundtrack, singing Seasons, and this cd is ""an oldie but a goodie"" I highly recommend the Singles soundtrack before the Euphoria Morning."
5,Grow up and listen,"What an accomplishment. Chris Cornell has grown and expanded. For all of you who think to get true energy from music it has to be fast and screaming, wake up. This CD is more powerful than any Soundgarden Record. Flutter Girl and The End of the world are instant classics. Chris has finally showcased his voice through a purer mediem. If you like Jeff Buckley, Euphoria Morning takes what he started and makes it better. You must listen to the album a few times to get the full effect. Then just lay back close your eyes and fall in."
5,What an amazing album.,"This is truly one of the best cds I have bought. I put it into my stereo when I first bought it over 3 months ago and it has not come out since. I know that Chris Cornell fans out there will not be dissapointed and even if you are not a fan of his, this album may change your mind."
4,"Good, inexpensive guitar for beginner","As far as guitars go, this is relatively inexpensive, making it great for a beginner who may not end up being fully committed to playing the guitar. Like my husband, who requested this for Christmas. Two years ago. And has played it...twice.But it sounded good as he was teaching himself to play online. What can I say, we still have it, it still sounds in tune to me after moving across country. It comes in a nice sturdy case as well."
2,Great Film - Lost on Widescreen TVs,"This film of the D-Day landing is a superb rendering of the events of June 6th, 1944. Unfortunately, those of us who have widescreen TVs will be forced to watch it in 4:3 ratio (which means that the picture is tiny - in the centre of the screen). The reason for this is that fairly large amounts of the film are (rightly so) in German and French, consequently, any attempt to blow the image up causes the subtitles for those languages to dissapear off the screen.If Fox had bothered to produce an anamorphic version of the film, then this would probably not be the case.Incidentally, Fox in their great and utter wisdom, for the Australian (Region 4) release of this film, although producing an anamorphic version, decided not to have any subtitles at all!Anyone watching this version for the first time must surely be totally mystified as to what was actually going on!"
5,A classic!,"I first saw this when I was a kid. I still enjoy all of the fantastic actor portrails of so many historical figures as well as the not so famous. It's a little cleaner than the more modern ww2 movies, doesn't show all the blood & guts. Historically accurate."
2,Sent the wrong merchandise,"I was greatly disappointed with Amazon, upon receipt of this product !! I clearly specified that I wanted the COLORISED version and clicked on same. I was led to believe by AMAZON that the colorised version was available, so I ordered it...And when it arrived, it was the same old B&W; version !! I'm still interested, but ONLY if it's colorised...Please let me know CLEARLY if you have that version available or not. I can always give away the B&W; version if I can acquire the colorised version....Do you have it or not???? Please answer me at [...] And no double talk, please !!Annie Silva"
4,Why not the colourised version?,"The Longest Day is very well paced and entertaining.I have the colourised video version and it is much better and more clear.I know that there are people against this and with some movies they are correct.But this is a war film,not an art film and colourising improved it.It's a pity they couldn't have had both versions on the DVD."
1,Did i watch the same movie?,"I find all the positive reviews about this movie very interesting indeed.This is certainly not the best war movie ever, and I ask you to watch some other war films ( including some foreign ones)such as: All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) Das Boot, Tae Guk Gi, (The beginning of) Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, even Apocalypse Now to name just a few. The movie does get a point for showing the different points of views and how the invasion was planned, but the bad acting and the boring over-stereotyped hollywood charachters make a good idea for a film fall flat.And where are the Canadians?!! I do beleive they were there!"
5,D-DAY!,"June 6, 1944!Truly ""The Longest Day""!3,000 dead on the beaches and fields of Northern France to liberate Europe from the Nazis!This is the day people in the U.S. have basically forgotten but not in Europe!Thank God for that.I remember and honor those men everyday!"
3,Was better when I was a kid...,"After saving private ryan and the latest batch of WWII movies, I have a hard time watching this film. While some others still remain good - still enjoy Patton and Bridge on the River Kwai, etc. I have a hard time getting through this film anymore. The beach scenes and some of the acting seems so fake."
5,Blu-Ray makes it even better,"Yeah, it's a B&W; movie, but the restoration and Blu-Ray resolution compelled me to upgrade from the regular DVD. I am very glad that I did.For many years, I had assumed that many of the characters were invented to make the plot more interesting. I just learned that Robert Mitchum's character (General Cota) had been at Normandy and had taken charge, much as the movie's character had. That makes me appreciate this movie even more."
3,"5 Stars for being a great film, 1 Star for accuracy","There has been so much written here that I won't go into details. Suffice it to say that this is a great war movie illustrating the logistical nightmare that D-Day was. BUT, overlooking the third key allied participant, Canada, who had their own seperate beachhead cannot be forgiven. Considering how long this film is, surely something could have been worked in on behalf of a country who was in the war from the start, and whose efforts at Dieppe (in northern France) helped provide valuable lessons that Allied commanders used in preparing for D-Day. 14,000 Canadian soldiers landed on Juno beach that day, along with 450 who parachuted in the previous evening. The Canadian navy was there as well including 10,000 sailors. Surely some mention of all this could have been made!"
5,One of the Best,"This is definitely one of the best war movies ever made. I watch it every now and then when I think about the good old days when I used to play with my little Army men. Any war movie collection, or any collection, would not be complete without this wonderful movie. The book is also a great read and I have them both. I highly recommend it."
5,BEST WAR FILM EVER!!!,"Of all war movies, this would have to rank as the best. It's not as good as Saving Private Ryan, it's BETTER! Based on the book by the same title, this film is surprisingly accurate. It covers the ENTIRE invasion (but the Gold-Juno beaches aren't shown in detail like the others), everything from Paratroopers to the Rangers on Pointe Du Hoc. Sure, it lacks gory violence like SPR, but that makes it even better. I don't want blood and gore, I just want a film that shows the events and happenings in detail, and this film delivers. 43 international stars are in this one, but some are only on screen for a minute or so. But who cares. We've seen them so many times. Germans speak German, and French speak French. No crude dubbing here, just good ol' subtitles! This film won 2 Oscars for cinematography and special effects. If you want to see a excellent war movie, or just wanna learn more about D-Day, this is as good as it gets! Colourized version is much better than B&W though."
5,pipi,What can I say that hasen't already been said.This is the classic movie of the Normandy invasion.A must see for everyone.
5,FIVE STAR MOVIE,"This movie rolls a credit that has every one who was someone. And the last credit sayes ""AND JOHN WAYNE"". And that sayes it all."
3,"""A Simple Plan"" redux","In a Fargo-ish effort, this film was pretty enjoyable. Good acting by everyone, especially, I thought, Sully's wife Mary. Just sit back and take it for what it is worth...not terribly philosophical or introspective at the time, but that may hit you later. A bit gruesome but you can take it. It adds color."
3,More than a Little Weird!,The movie was really weird. I couldn't tell if it was a black comedy or failed drama. Definitely for people with different tastes.
4,Interesting mobster flick,"It was interesting to see a change of role for the actor who played Detective Goren on Law and Order. I can't say how well this movie portrays mobster life as I am no part of it nor have I studied the Mob. The storyline was solid with interesting characters and dialogue. Part of me was not very surprised at the ending, but it was also rather unexpected. If you like mobster/detective films, you may like this."
3,ok reference,"Frankly, it is not as useful as I thought it would be. Economics is dry, and so is this dictionary. On the plus side, they capitalize other defined words, which can also be looked up."
2,myeh,"smells nice,but not worth the price. Especially considering it went up 2 dollars between clicking it and arriving in cart."
4,Pack spidy up for the academy arwards.,Spider man is fun for me tell you get to let's say the 4th level. But It is a good game. The most challengeing level is the 2nd one. Here you can try to get out a collapsing building. Just remember to watch out for the bad guys. The sound is awsome. Unlike Pacman collection you can save your score and save the game. The color is nice exept in a dimm room It's hard to see without a GBA worm light [And I can see frogger in the same room]. You need a plan to get into level 5 [which I haven't figured out yet] because you need stratgy to get to level 5 and keep your helth up. Kids under 6 probaly need to wait a year or two. In this game you can live the movie and have a ball.
4,Great performance in mediocre film,"I saw this film when I was 10 years old. I was certain I had found my bliss, Barbra Streisand. She had more talent than anybody I had seen in the world. Comedy, Drama, Ugly, Beauty and an incredible set of pipes. I felt embarassed that I loved her so much so soon. The blatant avid greed she has as a child orphan extortionist. The kooky quirkiness of Daisy who becomes the wiley beauty of Melinda, in a matter of seconds. The girl with questionable looks ""makes"" herself beautiful. That's acting. At times, I swear, she's a sure ringer for Liz Taylor. This film is so much fun. Barbra out drag queening the drag queens who had to learn to ""make"" themselves beautiful, too. This film has to be one big reason that they have honored her and imitated her."
3,JUST BUY THE ALBUM,"The tracklisting includes Happy and Call, + a remix of Happy. Happy and Call are both on the album ASHANTI. The remix of Happy is excellent, but it's not worth the money if only 1/3 of the songs are what you haven't heard. My reccomendation is to just buy the album (which is great!) and leave off the remix. If you're an Ashanti superfan, then I'd reccomend it to you, but its just an expensive 3-track single. You get the album for just a few bucks more. Please take my reccomendation. The video is also included, which raised my original rating from 2 stars to 3. The new album CHAPTER II is coming out on July 1, so watch out for that also! Hope my reccomendation was helpful to you."
1,Bad.,"Although I usually enjoy Ashanti's music, I'd have to say her single ""Happy"" holds a spot as one of her worst songs. It has a slow boring beat and airy, echoing vocals. It samples Gap Band's ""Outstanding"", but oh well, what do you expect? Also, this single also includes ""Call"", her album's WORST track. Please, for your own good, skip this."
5,Wish I Had Released This One,"I ran Kicking Mule when Bob Brozman recorded an lp for us. I thought then what I think now. He is the greatest acoustic blues guitarist living, and one of the all time greats. Unfortunately he did not record Truckload for us. I believe he did it for Sky Ranch, a French company and later Rounder released it in the US but I'm not sure. I wish I had released it because this CD all by itself would justify my quarter century in the music business.I'm a lawyer now and sold the record company over 10 years ago, but I still do a radio show and I play tracks from this CD from time to time.. I recommend to you the ""Backwards Blues"". It is not only a great parody, it is a great piece of music. ""You Set the Market"" stands out, too. Listen to tracks from this CD if you've never heard of Bob Brozman. If you like the blues, you'll like his music."
4,Good Sci-Fi flick!,"Although I might not go into great detail, I just want to say- I rented this movie, but wish I had it on dvd (my own collection) I thought the storyline was decent and had a surprise or two in it. I like the last person on Earth subject (scary-to say the least) I would say, if you arent sure you want to buy it---its as simple to just rent it. I am glad I took the time to watch it!"
3,"Quietly effective, then the plot starts careening, and you're in for a ride...!","The ""last man on earth"" theme has always been a great one. Two films (LAST MAN ON EARTH, OMEGA MAN) were made from Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND, and the scary short story ""The Deadly City"" was made into a passable 1950s film. This film had a video box that you'd probably pass over a dozen times at our local boutique, but I gave it a chance one night ... and was floored. The fresh, unleashed creativity here matched that of George Miller and Peter Jackson ... and just when I thought I had it figured out ... surprises lay in store.I hope this comes out on DVD. It's no Grade A classic, but it was a very interesting take on a couple of common, perhaps overused sci-fi themes. [SPOILER] And the interaction of the characters here reminded me of rougher, pulpier sci-fi stories of the 1950s. In all, this films deserves more than just a footnote."
2,The Quiet Earth,"Interesting premise in which a worldwide electronic network kills off almost all of the population, leaving only a few persons who had been involved in unique circumstances (no spoiler data here, so the viewer must wait until near the end of the film to discover why these few were spared).Not an epic by any stretch of the imagination, but it passed the time on a rainy afternoon. The plot is fairly well defined but none of the three characters elicited much empathy--there seemed to be little chemistry between them. Still, the twists held our interest."
5,A fate worse than death,"I thought ""On The Beach"" was the most chilling end-of-humanity film ever made until I saw ""The Quiet Earth."" It wasn't promoted much after it was released; all I remembered was the movie poster. I rented it one night and have been haunted ever since. Being the last human on earth would truly be more terrifying and maddening than dying among millions."
2,Interesting and slightly dated,I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again. You'll like this movie if your into this type genre.
5,rich and smooth,"Tracy Nelson has been a complete class act for decades. I grew up on her smokey, rich voice and music, and this CD is as grand as all of them. My favorite song on this recording is Livin' the Blues. It demonstrates her incredible range, humor and sassy, heart felt passion.Buy this, and any music you find by this amazingly talented woman. It will fill you with warmth, and leave you wanting more. I could listen to her voice for eternity and be content."
4,Need More Westerns Like This,"I have read multitudes of westerns. I have watched westerns for decades. I like a good cowboy movie with solid characterzation. Crossfire Trail is a movie with humor, drama, and a plain good acting from the entire cast. It is a fine western. Tom Selleck plays a convincing cowboy hero! I would like to see him in more of the same type of films."
4,Delassement,"Bon western de série A' qui repose de toutes les guerres des étoiles et autres sciences fiction, de configuration bande dessinée."
3,good for little jobs,"This is a good product if you are weeding a very small patch for a herb garden, or some small shrubs. Not for big yard jobs."
1,"BATTERY DIED, BUY A SMALL CORDED HEDGE TRIMMER.","Battery lasted less than 1 season and is expensive proprietary pack. Just another cheaply made, disposable tool with a battery not easily or cheaply replaced.Buy a small corded hedge trimmer and save yourself a lot of greif!!"
2,grass shear,This product seemed to work fine for a short time until the battery quit taking a charge. Battery was completly dead after about two months and would not take a charge.
3,A one minute review!,"Sometimes we need somebody who reminds us of what we already know. I guess it's the same with this book. This book points out the 3 key elements on managing people / staff. (It takes more then managing staff to be a good manager). Basic line the three techniques of one-minute management - clear goal setting, one-minute praisings and one-minute reprimands.The book is written in a way that's easy to read, don't expect rocket science."
3,Nice book good helpful straight forward tips,"My first real manager pointed me in the direction of this book, and you know what it's helpful. Offering some nice tips on how to make people feel important. One tip in the book about touching people on the elbow or shoulder really adds something to a quick exchange. Nothing earth shattering here but if you are new to managment or want to brush up on some concepts before going on a first interview for a managment job this is a nice read."
4,Common Sense Guide to Management,"This is a helpful book that explains the importance of effective management as applied to a hypothetical scenario. Helping people reach their full potential and catching them doing something right are examples of the material in this text. Common sense goes a long way, but common sense isn't as common as one would expect."
5,"Shallow, but great","It's easy to belittle this book for its endless platitudes, but the fact remains that its advice - if shallow - is rock solid. Every manager thet reads this book will be rude about it, but very manager SHOULD read this book and, despite their predictable rudeness, will go away with some simple and valuable points that are worth remembering. When I first read it (back in the Middle Ages sometime) I hated it, hated its style and hated the sense that I was being patronised. But I have found, over the years, that its message has stuck and that its fundamentals do apply to the real world of management much more than many ""worthier"" tomes."
1,The worst book I ever read cover to cover,"I had a half hour left of my lunch hour. Embodies the 80's management philosophy of coming out from behind the mahogany desk once in a while to inspire the little people. How Streisand. The book was somewhat amusing. Not the message, just the book: HUGE fonts and ample margins were effectively employed to make a fortune cookie into a real book, hardcover and all. Even had a glossy paper sleeve, just like the grown-up books."
1,Sends a bad message,"I read all the business and management books that I can find and this is by far the worst I have ever seen. The main character spends the entire book devoting his life to improving at his job after he makes a mediocre presentation to a client. In the end he finally presents the results of all his hard work to his supervisor. When she reacts positively, he stammers ""you mean you are not going to fire me?"" Are you kidding me? He showed he is as dedicated an employee as there ever was and worked like crazy to get better at his job. After all his dedication he ends up with very little self confidence. And even worse, his boss replies, ""I can't afford to fire you."" She jokes about how much they have invested in his training. Unbelievably bad book, the writing is very sophmoric, and the overall message is one of self doubt, groveling, and low self confidence. Save your money and avoid this book!"
4,This Product is ok.,It would have been better if it would contain some protien.Also detailed allergy information would help.[...]
5,Gorgeous patterns.,"I have not tried these patterns yet, but they are really classic. They read well, so I do not anticipate issues."
4,"""Testify"" alone is worth the price of the CD","Is there any style Bromberg can't play? Here he does folk-revival, country, gospel, rural-style blues, urban electric blues, and even a samba. The masterpiece of the album, and one of the best pieces of Bromberg's career, is ""Testify""--a gospel-singing, shouting, talking story/song that is brilliantly conceived and executed, with gospel choir quaking in the background."
4,FILM REVIEW,Excellent story line. The actors turned in first class performances. Terrific unexpected ending. The movie should have been an Academy Award contender.
5,Shining Through is great,very well done and kept me interested all way through. For me that is not easy. I seldom watch a movie without leaving to do something else while it is playing.
4,Shining Through,An exciting movie that will keep you on edge. As you roam through the problems of life in WWII you will enjoy this moving film. The characters are well-cast and the acting is superior. I recommend this film.
4,brave people in history,"I HAVE A GREAT FONDNESS FOR THE BRAVE PEOPLE OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR WHO HAVE CREATED HISTORY. THIS STORY HAS GREAT MEANING FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVED IN FREDOM, ALSO THE ACTING BY TWO GREAT ACTORS CREATE THE INTEREST YOU NEED TO ENJOY A MOVIE SUCH AS THIS"
1,Makes no sense,"I don't want to spoil any crucial plot elements, but I will say that the ending made no sense at all and spoiled the film unless it was meant to be an episode of the Twilight Zone. Can the same close-knit group of spies be on different sides without any one of them noticing or having it cause any of them problems except the heroine? How can they expect people not to notice this? (By putting a shoot-em-up romantic happy ending so that no one thinks at all about what has just happened.) What kind of movie is this?"
1,Don't bother,"Impossible, improbable situations. A woman in hot pursuit in Nazi Germany runs through town in a long white evening gown from a country house to a double agent's house and then to a friend's house. No one sees her. Ridiculous. Important documents are locked in a cellar, but wala! The key is above the door - who would have ever thought of that? She poses as a cook and does an awful job, the food is poor and she spills soup on an officer, gets fired but that same high ranking Nazi officer offers her a job caring for his children. Oh sure. Sorry, this one was too predictable and poorly written."
5,Incredible Shoes...,"I have two pairs of these, and I've had them both for more than a year. If you like bulky Dansko shoes, these are the most darling, comfortable Danskos on the market. I get complimented on them about 2 times a week, and they're exceptionally pleasant to wear....and they stay gorgeous for a long time if you don't abuse them too much. I prefer my clogs for heavy-use days, like walking in the rain and mud, or doing heavy lifting, simply because I don't mind them getting scuffed up... but for daily office wear, these are my all time favorites. Two pairs is almost enough. I would have five if I could justify the expense."
2,Neiko 1hp strainer water pump,"Spend the extra money for a better pump. I purchased this pump last season. The fittings leaked and would not properly tighten. I went ahead and used it most of the season anyway. Early this season, when attempting to re-prime the pump, I noticed that the sides of the plastic housing were sucking in and out then it cracked spraying water out of it. I replaced it with a Hayward. The motor seems to be well build and strong so I kept it to use if needed in the future and threw away the cheeply made plastic pump housing."
1,Horrible,Not a good tank game at all. My grandson hated it. Won't be buying any more of these Panzer Commander videos.
1,Tuner Technology: Analog,This shows up under digital ... but if you look closer it reads ... Tuner Technology: Analog
3,Good for beginners,"I work out a lot and this video I found was good for beginners and not for someone who is looking for an intense workout. The aerobic moves are very basic and toning is concentrating on thighs only - which I did find pretty challenging. If you are looking for a basic workout without a lot of sweat, this one is for you."
4,Don Mclean's Debut,"This debut album by Don Mclean contains several spectacular tracks. Don displays his incredible voice, his fantastic finger picking skills, his ability to write melodies and his poetic lyrics. The Highlights of the album rophetic, reference-laden Magdalene Lane,the biting Respectable, and the haunting General Store.The only issue with this album is that a few of the songs (most notably Tapestry, and The Orphans of Wealth) can at times become preachy. Yet, still they are good songs with poetic lyrics. The song Castles in the Airs is overly orchestrated and a few of the songs (Three Flights Up, Bad Girl) can at times feel disconnected. But, over all this is a great underrated album from one of the greatest singer-songwriters alive. From the melancholy ache of The Circus Song to the Country tinged swing of No Reason For Your Dreams this albums flows with golden, well written, well performed songs."
1,Why was this movie made?,"This movie was actually made in 1967, not 1987. It was discovered in a can right after SNDN 1 was made, and what luck. Oh, the luck. The flashbacks were an exact fit with the 1984 ""prequel"" and the modernistic cars they used in '67 just happened to have been manufactured and sold, providing a seamless mesh with the prequel. The original purpose of this movie was two-fold: First, it was of course produced by the California Teachers Association in an effort to inspire children to make greater efforts to complete their homework assignments while at home, instead of watching movies. Second, it was to presell SNDN 3 through the use of Sister Mary. Whoa! We hope SHE will be back. Her 5-star scream at the end of this 1-star movie is all that kept the censors from killing this product due to X-rated dreariness. LATE_BREAKING GOOD NEWS! THIS VHS TREASURE IS OUT OF PRINT"
2,To much of the first one,"Silent night Deadly 2was a badly acted, unneccesary sequal. The flashback scenes of Linnea Quigley topless had nothing to do with the story line and was just used for some nudity. I would like to know how the hell mother superior got all those wierd scars on her face. Anyway a bad movie with bad actors. A totally bad sequal."
1,TERRIBLE SEQUEL TO THE GREAT ORIGINAL,"This movie is flawed in so many ways. First off there are so many flashbacks of the first one,I would recommend just seeing the first one and skipping this. Secondly terrible script and horrid acting by Eric Freeman(Ricky's character) and also slow paced at times unlike the first one that kept me attention the whole film. Thirdy Ricky does a lame job with the killings unlike his predcessor(Billy who was actually scary/crazy),I mean running around with a gun thats lame,and killing someone with jumper cables,give me a break. FINAL VERDICT: SKIP THIS EXCUSE FOR A SEQUEL AND WATCH THE 1984 CLASSIC(SILENT NIGHT,DEADLY NIGHT)WHICH IS A CULT HORROR CLASSIC THAT IS LONG OOP AND HARD TO FIND BUT WELL WORTH IT AND SELDOM ON EBAY IF YOUR LUCKY!"
2,its alright,"most of this movie is flashbacks from the first one.delightful, but why did they even bother making this one? i mean wouldn't you rather just watch the first. its a lot better. i mean, this one is kind of good, it has its momments, but the best scenes are lifted right from the origenal. i baught this for a buck at a video game rantal store. it was worth it- but if your going to rent this just rent the first one again. its better"
2,"Listen to what others have to say, their usually right","Sequel to the original (which was controversial and even picketed!) plays half as just flashbacks from the first and the second half is the continuing of the killing. Pretty stupid sequel is sick and boring at times but certain events are funny and the lead uses his sexuality to sway the mood. I realize the intent of the film makers is probably not to make people laugh, but a movie like this can't help but do much else. Don't wait around for the DVD version. I was surprised to find out this was available on video!"
2,BAD MOVIE,"My friend and i were looking for a bad horror movie, and we found it. First of all, it was 50% the first film, which is strange because in our video store it's labled that you must be 18 to rent it and we're younger than that and we rented this one. The story is stupid. PLEASE! santa? The writhers of this must have been high or something when they wrote this."
1,Awful,"This book just isn't worth it. Whether one is or is not an Imus fan, he is a fascinating subject for a biography. But this book is basically a rehash of things that have been said or written elsewhere. It has a number of out-of-date references, has nothing but dated pictures from more than ten years ago, and has factually inaccuracies and misspellings. Sorry, but don't waste your time or money."
4,Excellent Christmas Story,I thoroughly enjoyed this book as did the elementary age sunday school class. We plan to use this idea in our Candlelight service this year.
1,Huge problem with this book!,"There is one huge problem with the premise of this book and that is that MARY DOES NOT HAVE GRANDCHILDREN. She is ever-virgin and has only birthed Jesus, God's son. Jesus never married or had children, so how could Mary have a grandchild? When I see books like this that get past publishers (Christian ones, to boot!), I have to wonder where this world headed."
3,I had this cd for a long time now,"It's been a while since I've listened to this CD. I know this may sound crazy, but it sounds like it would make you car sick. lol. But I like it. My sister bought it for me, for one of my birthdays. It was when Twister was in the movie theatre.. That was a long time ago. Anyways, good CD. #5 is my favorite. Because I like Thunderstorms."
1,Boring and Dated,"This album is nothing but a collection of boring, predictable sound samples heard on thousands of other ""blue light"" special cds selling for 1/10 the price Elfin Music charges here at amazon. The artist uses poor technique, not to mention other artists' ideas, and presents them as his own.Ed Van Fleet's music is sounding more dated all the time; this album is no exception. The genre is NEW age....not OLD age..."
3,Pretty Good,"Nothing spectacular. It gets the job done, I would say its fairly accurate. Built ok, it will last if you treat it right. If you are looking for precision, look elsewhere, but this will get any basic job done."
2,poor quality,"the wheel used to move the caliper is loose. it can be adjusted, but even with the screwpin adjustment, it does not stay securely in its track, thus the caliper is INACCURATE. since I purchased this to find a relatively inexpensive way to judge the diameter of stone beads, it does not serve its purpose"
3,"Not bad, not great either","This product isn't great nor is it bad. Make sure as the owner you always re adjust your Zero after every measurement or else you will be between 2 or 3 off every time. Other than that for the price, not bad."
2,Cheap but have bought better for the same price,"These calipers by Pitbull are not the best I've ever had. My biggest complaint is that the slider and channel are very rough and therefore are not very smooth when opening and closing them to take measurements...got to love that metal scraping on metal sound. Also, the sticker (with the ruler) was delaminating already when I opened them.I've bought some cheap $10 calipers before on Amazon and they were great, worked well for what I needed them for, smooth slider, and lasted for about 2 years before the display went haywire...so although these are cheap, I was disappointed when comparing them to others I've purchased for the same price."
3,Just OK,"This isn't a precision tool. Operation is rough. Requires zeroing every use. I use it for watch crystals and it works fine. Hobbys and crafts woulb be a good use as well. It came in a nice case and had an extra battery. I wouldn't trust it for anything that requires accuracy in the thousandths. If you want real precision, buy a good dial micrometer."
3,Caliper,It would be nice if you could remove the digital screen to use it manually but other than that its great.
5,Great product. Accurate,"This was a great buy. It is accurate, It has a nice storage case. I don't know how long the battery will last (I have a digital scale that eats 9 volt batteries) because I don't use it very often."
2,"6"" LCD Digital Caliper","Worked well the first 2 weeks, but now the measurement occasionally jumps .200mm, so not always to be trusted for accuracy, but for $11.23, it's about what I expected."
1,Sometimes It Might Give the Right Length...,"... but usually it just produces random numbers, measurements that are impossible (22 inches?!). Apparently the makers are aware of this habit, as the instructions said to wipe the shaft to dry it otherwise you get crazy results... but this unit was not wet. It started doing that right out of the box (as soon as I replaced the battery, because of course the one already installed was dead... so much for the ""spare"" battery.) Later it started occasionally giving ""right"" answers (at least the numbers looked reasonable and when I opened it and closed it it returned to zero) but then it reverted to crazy answers. A piece of junk."
1,"Cheap, But Waste of Money!","I knew it was too good to be true, getting a decent digital caliper this cheap! The readout is defective, stuck on one number, and won't change no matter what you do to it. My advice is to just suck it up and pay more for a good one! Disappointed, but not surprised."
1,Not worth the price,"This is the worse piece of junk that I have ever seen. Some of the other reviews, hit the nailright on the head. So to speak, it does not give anything that is the same. The measurement resultsare all over the place. I am using it for reloading, and with the same item, it give at least 10 differentmeasurements.DO NOT WASTE your money.."
2,well,Well they are cheap and you get what you pay for so no surprise here. I have not even used them I just bought a new set of mitituyo cost alot more but I needed them at my job anyway.
5,Very Good Tool - don't let the low price fool you !,Lost my last set at the security check going thru the Hong Kong Airport . Bought three sets of this caliper to leave at different locations incase I cannot carry in carry on luggage .Great tool and a even greater price . The set that was pulled from my bag in HK was Mitutoyo.
4,Just what I expected,"I wasn't expecting much when I ordered these calipers. I just needed something to give me some measurements since all I had was rulers to measure by. The calipers soome to be accurate enough. I haven't had them calibrated (and they are not calibrated by the manufacturer), but by all accounts, if it is off, it couldn't be by more than a couple thousandths. They're not real smooth to use, but I have been able to look past that.The extra battery was a nice plus, but the case is impressive. In my opinion, the $11 I paid for this set was worth it just to get the case. It's a hard plastic case and I feel secure luggin my calipers around inside them.All-in-all, I have no problems using these calipers. For the price, I would recommend them to anyone that needed a pair, unless you need one for engineering that is calibrated."
1,Worked great.....for a week,"I purchased these calipers for work and was excited when they came in and worked great! They continued to work great until a few weeks later when 1 cm was measuring at 265,009.23 mm. Yeah, that's a little off."
1,Did not come with batteries,"Ordered from micro-tools, fulfilled by amazon. Tool seems to be in working order, however it did not come with either of the batteries. Will cost more to return and get a new package (which may or may not come with batteries) then it will to buy the batteries myself. Hopefully the tool is actually new and not a returned item; will test function once I have batteries. Thumb screw that moves the caliper seems to be loose as well."
2,Accuracy ???,"These calipers are great when they work. Sometimes though, they put out completely random measurements, suce as 231.55mm when they are only opened to around 20mm. Hard to rely on something so inaccurate..."
1,Sucks,"The cal will reset while you're taking measurements... 'Nuf said.But to go on: cheep construction, plastic box cracked easily. It's just cheep and unreliable."
4,Excellent value,"My evaluation is simple: for the money, this is an outstanding tool.It's not as smooth or accurate as products 5 and 10 times as expensive, but that's not what I need. For most of my work, tolerances to a thousandth of an inch is fine. What it does is give good, reliable, repeatable measurements out to a thousandth of an inch if you use good technique. I'm pleased with battery life.I'm buying a second unit because the first has been so useful."
4,shouldn't buy anything else,"I had my last broom for 15 years. The Harper products are worth the money, and long lasting. Will order again"
5,Great if you don't use too much,"I like the flavor of this product and it's a great way to eat salt without eating too much of it. The one caveat here is that you don't pour extra salt on to compensate for the lower strength of the flavor. This may sound silly if you haven't tried it, but it's very easy to catch yourself pouring more on which is just as bad as eating regular salt."
4,Enjoyable and worth the time,"I've always wanted to read this book so ""free"" on Kindle seemed like the time. I really enjoyed this story although at times, I gave my dictionary a good workout. There were certain descriptions in this book that I liked so much that I would read them over and over again not even realizing I was doing it. I think this is because they so vividly reminded me of certain childhood memories. I liked one so much that I added it to ""My Clippings"" so I can return to it again and again. Since I didn't really know anything about this story previously, when I was very near the end, I kept wondering how in the world it was going to tidy up for the ending. The last little bit of the story was quick, exciting and it came together with a bit of a twist. I'm really glad I finally got the opportunity to read this book. Now I think I'll go have an oly koek."
2,So Maybe I'm A Sucker For The Modern...,"Perhaps the old classics aren't for me. The archaic language was difficult to follow in places, and there wasn't much actual story. Irving very much liked to go off on tangents, describing things in detail when it wasn't needed (not to say the descriptions were poorly done, simply that they shouldn't have been there). To put the actual story on paper, it would probably fill half a page.That being said, it's nice to sometimes read older works- it's a way to 'cleanse the palette', as it were.As for the actual Kindle edition- there were a number of glitches in the type (letters replaced by random symbols). Perhaps someone should take another look at editing this."
5,A CLASSIC,"I bought this CD last Halloween, and I just ordered one as a gift. I read the Library Jouranl review. WOW! has this reviewer ever read the book?? The ""acting is over the top??"" The BOOK is over the top! This recording nailed Washington Irving's beautiful words and brought the whole flavour of the book to life. The acting is great! Lincoln Clark is THE definative Ichabod Crane. The narration draws you in, and the music score deserves a CD of its own. This will surely be a Halloween tradition in my family. Library Journal - dust off the book and read it again. You will see that this production by the incredible Colonial Radio Theatre hits the nail on the head. It is a masterpiece!"
2,Now a Drama,"This season really took the show from a comedy to a drama. I was a huge fan of HIMYM, however this last season left me feeling sad after nearly every episode. I rarely laughed, far different from the first few seasons that had me laughing out loud nearly the entire time."
5,DVD TV Series,This series is one that my kids really like and they've followed these characters since the beginning. So I try to keep them up-to-date on the series as it moves along. They're very happy with it. That's what counts.
3,shipment,The shipment took a lot longer than I had hoped. I could have bought it cheaper at Wal-Mart and sooner and didn't realize it until I already purchased it on here.
3,Loved the Season,Should have just waited for it to come out on Netflix or reruns. That's what happens when you are impatient.
1,I'm done with this show....,"I used to love this show, but it's just too ridiculous now. This season we've only watched so we could see how Ted meets the kids' mother.... But I just don't care any more.Security pulls guns on Barney at the airport but he has no reaction? Barney's apartment is decorated like a Hello Kitty fanatic's place? How stupid.I haven't laughed with this show for a LONG time."
1,still waiting,"I think one have to be very passionated about the delivery time, even if I was warned for the late delivery.Now it takes ""TO"" long waiting. I'm afraid I never will receive this product. What about my payment I already did do long time ago. I only hope the Amazon seller ""KRUSHCO WRESTLING"" will not run away with my money without delivering."
3,Does it have game?,"Harlem Globetrotters' manager once said, ""It's important for our players tp learn how to play basketball well before they learn how to perform their flashy moves."" Wise man, indeed. Street Hoops dosen't seem to have learned this leason, as the basketball itself is lacking in comparison to the amount of culture and attidue. The up-and-down court action is missing speed and excitement, with player moves that look very nice at times and pretty bad at others. There is an overall feeling that the game is missing energy and trying to make up for it with crowd-pleasing moves and music. When you get of the court the title customization area where you can dress up, primp and pamper your players with money you have, and earn more by betting on games and performing well. From there you can unlock videos and special characters; the options here are quite impressive. Street Hoops is not a bad game.. it just puts too much focus on the extra features and not enough on the basketball itself."
5,OLDIE BUT GOODIE,"A wronged Indian women and a framed cowboy take their revenge on a small corrupt town, razing it overnight. Absolutely, payback time on the range!"
4,Stays with you!,"I've been thinking and pondering about what I've read in this book. There is a deep challenge here and a reflective, curious integration with Christianity, history, nationalities, animal types and typologies. If you are interested / excited about self discovery and going deeper as a searcher, I would recommend this to you"
4,"Good cd, but very reserved","I'm going to keep this very short. Roy Hargrove is a marvelous trumpet player. He is one the very few vying for Lee Morgan's unoccupied spot as ""the"" trumpet player of his time. As good of a set as this is, and as ""on"" as Hargrove is, it is too relaxed for me to get overly excited. There are a few tunes that Hargrove really cuts loose on (e.g. the opener ""Soppin' The Biscuit""), but he is largely reserved resulting in a cd I consider to be too laid back. I think I've been spoiled by Nicholas Payton."
3,Lack of pictures...,"Bought this book to show picts for my children before visiting this ancient city. There are not too many pictures in this book, there seems to be a lack of illustrated books of this city."
2,bad screenplay turned even worse by a worst female actor,"the dialog is so unnatural and so contrite. the female leading actor does not look like anything but with a killer figures in white bikini. a stupid scenario tried to mimic 'the blue lagoon' buttered with a bit of brosnan's 'robinson cruso?' junk, mixed some more of 'the swiss family of robison (or is it 'swiss robinson family'? well, whatever). the whole movie would never survived if without bill zane. the latin lover actor also acted so badly. the whole movie is just a disaster, skin-deep shallow and unconvincing at all. we had rejected it out of the dvd player twice, then thought to make the rental worth and decided to force ourselves to finish it. well, still cheaper than going to the Caribbeans in person, can't afford it even in my next life."
3,EYE CANDY,Kelly Brook is an Awesome looking British Model. The story is entertaining..at least more so than the standard SKin-A-MAX type shows....Some nudity...some blod and violence...a ship wrecked threesome.
4,Campy version of Dead Calm?,"I tell you if these people were real, I'm not sure I'd like a single one of them but that didn't stop this movie from keeping my interest. Sometimes weird is good & that's the case here.There are def. similarities to Dead Calm although Dead Calm seems more realistic & dramatic IMO while this one is almost on the campy side with a voodoo ""twist"" to fill in ""plot holes"" & a ""convenient"" resolution between our two guys on the island.Kelly Brook fans should like the amount of exposure she gets. For me it could've been more but I guess they decided to keep it more on the tasteful side than downright exploitation.Billy Zane gives a very interesting performance that is reminicent of Dead Calm at points for sure. It's almost the same formula except there were actually people to root FOR in Dead Calm. Not sure that's the case here but a fun movie IMO."
1,Really?,"So, who wrote this, because it had to be a man. Of course, women could never survive without a man, could they? And wouldn't they just do the silliest possible things imaginable? Treat each other terribly? Or run around with flowers in their hair and dance all day? Not one of them would be able to grow their own food, and for sure - they would absolutely drug and abuse any other women out of what? jealousy? Oh please. The only good part of this is the end where the only man alive after the rain is GAY!This is just awful, not campy. It belittles women in every possible way. Save your money."
4,crush no crush,"Have had this crusher about 3 months now. Fairly sturdy it seems. Mounted it in a stud on the garage wall feeding into a 15gal recycle bin. Crushed several hundred cans and doesn't seem like it will wear out any time soon.12oz cans no problem. My Coor's cans (slightly taller than reg 12oz) do fit but anything taller (tall boys or guiness etc.) will not fit.This crusher crushes can top to bottom flat as can be expected. Some other crushers crush can lying down ""folding"" them in the middle not giving much more room than tossing them whole so this one is nice.Once you load the can you don't touch it again as the crushing motion goes down and forward so when you return to the open position can has been ejected dropping into your container.Very nice device. Gave 4 instead of 5 stars because wont crush tall cans but what it does it does very well."
1,not happy didn't last.,Bought this can crusher instead of the original the crusher. I should of stuck with what I knew would work. I have this set up in a bar for a true test. I maybe got one or two months use before the handle broke. Going to buy metal The crusher and save money.
5,High quality crusher,"Length:: 0:16 MinsThis crusher keeps going and going and going! It is made of a very strong plastic, and unlike metal crushers, the pivot point on this contraption is rock solid. I've had it for almost two months now. It's easy to install, quick and fun to use, and it crushes standard size cans down to a fraction of the size. It's great. Instead of buying the collection can, I place a big plastic tote underneath the crusher - the cans automatically discharge into it.For a moderate workout, collect a good amount of cans and then bring them to the crusher and start crushing away! It's a fun, rhythmic process that leaves you with a sense of accomplishment after you're done."
5,5 years old and still going strong,"Sad to say, but after 5 years, my Easy Pull can crusher finally gave up the ghost. However, this was only after a can drive resulting in 100s if not 1000s of cans per week for the last 6 months. I have tried every other type of can crusher on the market, and none lasted like this one. Pivot points on the other brands wear out within 6 months at most. This one just kept on going, and when it finally failed, guess what, I find that because it was one of the earliest models the problem has been corrected in the newer ones. The manufacturer was extremely helpful, and because mine was one of the earlier models (before upgrades) they replaced it. I couldn't be more satisfied with this product. It restored my faith in American made products."
2,bent as in other reviews,"This crusher worked well at first then bent like other reviewers said. Hope the manufactuer sees this and replaces it.Does not last as long as it should.Need another one, any suggestions??????????"
5,can crusher,"Best one I've had in years! The auto dispensing was not a selling point for me, the construction was. But once it was up and I was using it - Nice."
4,So Easy & Long Lasting,This product is fabulous. So easy to use. This is my second one as the first one finally wore out with the handle breaking. We do a lot of recycling and I would hate to count how many thousands of cans it did. A very good product.
5,Exactly What I Wanted,"Bought it, installed it with the included screws over our regular open kitchen trash can, and am completely happy. It works smoothly and drops the crushed cans below into the trash just like I hoped it would."
5,I like it!!,"So far it seems very well made. Much sturdier than some of the other ones I was looking at to buy. AND........When you pull the handle and crush the can, the mechanism tilts forward and when you release the downward pressure, the can falls into the tub I have just below.. No fuss... no muss. However, I think only 12oz cans will fit (Not sure of that though). But pressure needed to crush can is minimal and so far the can doesn't slip out while crushing (It did on my former can crusher). The only negative I can find so far, and it is not really a negative, is the handle is long as you can see in the picture. It makes the can crushing easier, but where I had to mount it the handle stuck up higher than I would have liked. (I have limited space)This is a nice can crusher and I would recommend it."
2,Great for 35 days,"Reading reviews I thought I would get a few years out of the ""CRUSHER"" after modifications which I joyfully chewed through cans of all types for 35 days. I mounted it to a 1/4"" thick mild steel plate slightly larger than it's overall size with two extra holes I drilled for rigidity after other crushers' units reported failure. Well my unit's body remained rigid but the left hand mounting point for the stress bearing pivot sheared making it useless. I will not order another due to poor casting design for the plastic. 1/8"" more here, extra ribbing there... MaybeeAll in all too bad."
1,5-Stars as a comedy album,Can these guys even play? It sounds like amateur hour at the local open mike night. Sloppy playing and thoughtless arrangements of a few standards and a couple of originals. It's basically a straight-ahead quintet with Sun Ra noodling above it all on synthesizer apparently whenever the spirit moves him. I laughed out loud several times at his absurd interjections. None of the soloists generate much excitement and the occasional interesting idea is never explored or developed. Gilmore especially sounds tired and bored. Maybe Sun Ra is a jazz legend but this record sounded like jive to me.
3,Overview only--some rare pictures,"I got a copy of this book as a gift (had I paid for it, I might have to deduct half a star), and it contains illustrations which I have never seen elsewhere. Those alone have some value. The problem with the Taschen approach is that it is not only multi-lingual but sometimes seems to be lowest common denominator as well. At this point in their long career of writing about noir, it's interesting to see a distilled text from the authors; but I must agree that in terms of analytical depth, it doesn't quite measure up to their book on ""The Noir Style"" or their anthology ""Film Noir Reader"" series. If you can't afford them all, buy those first."
2,What kind of company sells a fixed blade knife without a sheath???,"I think it's downright irresponsible to sell a fixed blade tactical knife and not include some kind of sheath. This is not a kitchen knife that is meant to be stored in a drawer or toolbox. It is meant to be carried with you. What are you supposed to do with it, wrap it in a rag, put it in your backpack, and hope you don't fall on it and get stabbed?At least the smaller of the 2 knives is a folder and can be safely carried in a pocket or clipped to gear.Come on Winchester/Gerber, spend the extra buck and throw in a cheap sheath so people can safely use your product!!"
3,interesting information,This is a nice little book that has some very interesting things. It did not satisfy my needs. I was looking for a 'mile-by-mile' guide that would show points of interest as one cruised the Columbia and Snake Rivers.
1,Beastly bad film,"Concept is familiar -- man turns into a monster, not too different from old werewolf films. But this film has no appeal whatsoever. The writing and the acting are so wooden that it is impossible to care about any of the characters. It's not scary, it's not funny, it's just a boring waste of time. How did something this amateurish ever get OK'd and produced? (On the other hand, it is kind of fun to think about a double-feature pairing ""Track of the Moon Beast"" with 1959's similarly plotted but not as awful ""The Hideous Sun Demon."")"
3,"Okay, but a memory hog","This typing tool is useful for novice typists who want a quick, but fun way to improvise and increase their technical skills on the computer keyboard. The only problem that this program takes up most of the memory and even if I got the computer which has a whopping heap of unused memory, Mavis Beacons gobbles it eventually as if it is hungry for more. The graphic, when used on the older computer is slow and cumbersome, but if you want to find a better typing software that uses only half of the memory, I'd keep on searching."
2,The worst sound of bud powell on verve,The content here is probably pretty good. I am not a Powell afficionado and left the picking and choosing to Verve. Verve should have left the sound to somebody else. The sound quality is just awful. The pitch is wrong most of the time which is probably due to tape stretch and speed problems. I guess it is a stretch to think that any recording before about 57 or 58 would sound worth a damn. Sorry Bud. You were born too soon and I guess died too young. Check out the Blue Note RVG's instead. Leave this one in the bargain bin.
3,Good,"Fast shipping, don't know if it worked all that well on the fleas as I used other products simultaneously but it works okay."
3,Not What I Expcected,"This is not the origanal Space Invaders I remember from the arcade. It's more like a 3D Galaxian. It was hard for me to get over the differences. That said, my daughter really liked it with the exeption of ""all the reading bits you have to 'A' through to get to the game part"". It is a bit much to click through every time....If you haven't grown up with the origanal, you won't notice the difference and will most likely enjoy the game. It is a good challenge if you like shooting games."
3,A Room With a View,This was one of the few books I was able to import to my Kindle Fire when I first got it and was just a title I had heard of.
2,Review for A Room with a View,"It is okay. The storyline is kind of confusing, and definely not the best romance or any story that I had ever read."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzz.........,"maybe i could have enjoyed this book if i could have understood. i'm a high school freshmen in honor's english and i was forced to pick out a classic novel to do a critique on. unfortunatly, i read peoples reviews on this book and it sounded good. don't get caught up in the web of boring-ness. maybe if you're an english scholar you're understand this book, but being just a normal teenager, i sure didn't. i found myself falling asleep many times while reading this book, so i was forced to prop my eyelids open with toothpicks and snack on a variety of candies just to stay consious. take my advice and do yourself a favor, READ SOMETHING ELSE."
4,A Room with a View,"If you are the one who loves reading love story, this book is an interesting one. It gives a clear picture of middle-class life in England one hundred years ago. You will see the importance that was given to social position and appropriated behaviour. Moreover,its grammas are good. It appropriate for children who want to practise their gramma. This book is about the girl who struggle to make sense of her feelings towards the two very different men in her life.Let's find out what she is going to do with her life."
1,"this rating is for the Kindle edition, not book itself","The book itself gets 5 stars from me.This Kindle edition is atrocious - it is missing entire passages. I think it is only sections involving quotes from another work; I stopped reading because I didn't want to spoil the pleasure in re-reading this wonderful book.Same problem with the Kindle edition of Howards' End, btw. In that case, actual narrative seemed to be missing."
5,A truely touching record,"while many other bossa nova albums are tinged with an influence of commercialism and strings, this album is a diamond. unlike many other bossa nova albums, this album features all great players, all who seem to have a very good understanding and knowledge of the music. some of the others albums, such as jazz samba, feel like a jazz take on brazil, which can be good if you wnat that, but this music is true bossa nova, while bringing jazz influencess, Getz fits in perfectly into this extremely different category of music.As for laurindo almieda, all i can say is wow, what a sadly overlooked figure in bossa nova, and guitar music in general. hes soloing is smart, mature, and playfull, bringing out the best in getz and and company.Out of every Getz or Bossa Nova album, get this one and Stan Getz with Luiz Bonfa: Jazz Samba Encore, two of the most touching albums i have ever heard in my whole life. buy them together!!-ian"
5,Classic Solid Gold Bossa Nova,"This CD is one of the absolute best ever recorded Bossa Nova!Getz and Almeida are at their best. The unique flavor of bass playing by George Duvivier is amazing. Recorded in 1963 but released in 1966, this is a must-have for all bossa lovers like me. Of the many versions of Jobim's ""Outra Vez"" in my vast collection, this one is the best. If you don't like this album, you don't like Bossa Nova."
2,"Hopkins Subzero 17511 All Season Windshield Screen 70"" x 29""","The screen is about 2"" to 3"" inches too short from top to bottom to fit windshield of my subcompact car. Consequently, it defetas the purpose of protecting the windshield from frost and snow. Skimping on material in this area defeats the purpose of a good concept. Recommend you measure your windshield before buying!"
2,Too much for me,"In his Preface, Feynman admits that these lectures were aimed at ""the most intelligent students"" coming out of high school into Caltech. He also admits that many students had trouble with the content judging from their performance on the examinations and said that his system of lectures is ""a failure"". I agree with Feynman. These lectures are very hard to understand. Partly the lectures, prepared in early 1960s, suffer from being rather dated. Mostly though this material is presented in a confusing way, with lots of complicated mathematics that often hinders comprehension. I recommend getting a basic college textbook instead (Physics for Scientists and Engineers by Wolfson and Pasachoff is a good choice)."
5,Chuck Rocks!,Love the Chuck Klosterman Books. He is a hilarious read. He is charming and witty and intelligent. He is a Pop culture genius!
4,Pop Culture as an example for life,"Klosterman's book is one of the most enjoyable reads I've found. He cleverly ties items from every end of the pop culture spectrum, from sports, to music, to tv, to porn and spins them all into a clever web which at the end begins to look a lot more like you and I than the characters on tv.Laugh out loud funny, but well written. And spot on analogies."
1,The lame observations of an unfunny man.,"I'll keep this short since I've already wasted enough time reading this garbage. Chuck Klosterman presents his limited view on a number of uninteresting topics. He presents his humorless observations as if they have some bearing in absolute truth, when they are just solely his poorly thought out perceptions. The only reason one would purchase a book such as this is to get a laugh. However, there isn't a single funny line in this entire book."
2,Can you say boring three times fast?,"Oh, how I wanted to love this book. I love books about nothing, especially when people write about nothing very well. Nothing can be really amusing, and nothing is the perfect prelude to sleep. This book, however, almost induced a coma with all of its pretentious stupidity and references to Pamela Anderson and various serial killers. While the effort to be Deep and Outrageously Funny shown through like a 5000 watt lightbulb, the actual result amounted to one of the most mind-numbing and tedious expositions on Nothing that I have read in a long time. (Read at your own risk.)"
3,Meh.,It's pretty good. Not at all as good as I thought it'd be but that's just me.It was cheap so it was not to bad.
4,not my usual thing,chuck klosterman is funny. this book is funny. if you keep abreast of pop culture and pop culture writing or think its all absolutely ridiculous you will find this book entertaining. i chuckled and laughed out loud many times. his observations and his nonsensical use of logic and statistics when applied to culture are often brilliantly ludicrous.i noticed some reviews complained about it being repetitive or just too much of the same. i think this is silly. he has a voice. if you read it straight through it would be like listening to a twelve hour lecture. even mark twain's essays would be intolerable straight through.
4,Great fun read,"If you enjoy pop culture, thoughtful commentary on social behavior, and the a witty author that can uniquely link the two, then you'll enjoy this book. Fun quick read."
4,love this pov!,this point of view is so great and i can relate to most of it. a little rambling at times seems like filler but i will definitely be looking for more books from this guy.
2,Reads like a a history text,"The book appears to be comprehensive, but it is written in a pedantic and boring way, very much like so many history books I had to read in school. That made it difficult to retain my interest. Don't get me wrong; I love to read, but I'm not a scholar, researching to write about the plantation life, but just an ordinary person who found the title interesting, so was curious enough to buy it. For me it was a mistake. I won't send it back, because the effort would just add to my aggravation, but I wouldn't buy it again and do not recommend it for anyone who's not doing research."
2,Poor Choice for statewide travel,"I purchased the Fodor's review for my statewide travel around Oregon. I'd hoped to find recommendations for the major cities, including the state capital. However, only Portland is mentioned and the reviews failed to capture the essence of this city.Installation was easy and use was as one would expect of the NUVI."
2,Disappointed,This travel guide is disappointing in that it focuses only on major cities ( and not a lot of them) with limited information
2,Limited Coverage,I agree with the other comments about the coverage only being for large metro areas or POI such as Grand Canyon or Wine Country. For intermittent information between large cities it nothing.Really not worth $50. get an AAA book
5,Riveting account of a Broadway birth,"Ted Chapin is well-known figure in the Broadway community, and writes from a vantage point few of us will ever experience. He takes us step-by-step through the trials and tribulations of getting a Broadway musical through the rehearsal process, having obviously kept copious notes throughout. The fact that both Hal Prince and Stephen Sondheim read the manuscript and ""...offered helpful corrections and suggestions"" adds to the authenticity of the work. He doesn't overly glamorize the people involved, nor is it simply backstage gossip. We are taken through the many steps that are involved in putting up a huge Broadway musical, including helpful details of jobs that many people are not aware of, including music copying, orchestration, set design and construction, lighting, sound, costumes... and the people who try to keep them all together and created the finished masterpiece that is ""Follies."" I hate to sound trite, but I couldn't put it down!"
1,NOT Well Made.,"Within a week the box was cracked, now the solder points have come apart. I am NOT a fan. If I had to guess without looking its MADE IN CHINA!"
2,So sloooow,"This movie started decent and then dragged on and on... and on... and I felt the ending gave very little to be desired, especially after watching the whole movie. It has it's moments, very few and far between"
3,EVERYBODY HATES RAYMOND,"Adrian Brody is trapped (1960's car?) at the bottom of a ravine. His face is streamed with blood. His nose is broke and his right eye is swollen. His leg is trapped under the dash. He has 2 dead friends with him, one has a wallet. His name is George. Brody apparently isn't carrying ID. The window is busted out so he can drink rainwater. The door is jammed. Over time he hallucinates about a woman who seems to want to help him. He discovers a revolver with discharged shells on the driver's side. His memory is in disarray.After several days, Adrian manages to free himself. The film is about is journey to safety.Adrian Brody plays the role well. The movie is interesting, but not overly entertaining. The twist is fine, but this should be an ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" and not a 90 minute feature.F-bomb. No sex, no nudity."
2,An average book by a good mathematician,"This is one of the worst undergraduate algebra texts I've ever seen. Although everything Jacobson says in his book is true, his writing style makes the material seem more difficult than it really is. Many results in the book are not numbered or highlighted from the rest of the book, and this makes it virtually impossible to retrieve information when needed. In order to find the result you want you probably need to read the entire section to find it. This book is a counter example to the following conjecture: If a person is a good mathematician, then he writes good mathematics textbooks."
1,Verbose and poorly organized compared to similar texts.,"Basic Algebra is not well written. The material here is the same as covered in many other books, such as Hungerford, but Hungerford covers the material in a concise organized manner. Jacobson might be a little more accessible to beginning readers, but is more confusing as well. It hides definitions and important theorems in the middle of paragraphs. The index is horrendous. The examples are mixed in with everything else in a manner which makes it hard to pick anything apart in a chapter. Stick with another graduate Algebra text if you want to learn from the book, as it takes a good professor to make this book work. Jacobson is certainly a great Mathematician, but I do not recommend him as an author for this material."
2,This book is pedagogically unsound.,"I have recently had the unpleasant experience of finishing a higher course in Algebra which used Jacobson's book. To make a long story short, I never once found myself using this book to solve any problems listed in Jacobson, it is the most unorganized and unconnected book (in terms of it's theorems and results and how they came about) that I have ever attempted to learn from. This book is certainly NOT self-contained, nor does Jacobson explicitely list or even sometimes give results which may help solve his exercises. The material is presented either more confusingly than it has to be, or in such a way that one wonders why it was presented in the first place. I don't understand why any mathematician would recommend this book to use as a primary text in a course."
3,It gets old quick,"This game gets old quick. The missions all feel the same but they are set in different levels. I wish I didn't buy this game. After the 5th level, I quit playing because it got too repetive. This game has awful graphics too. The people shooting at you look like they were cut out of cardboard. The ground looks really fake. It looks like it could have been made on the PS1 and still look the same. The only reason why it got 3 stars from me is because it is sometimes fun. I's worth a rental but not a purchase."
5,Light Portable and Complete!,"I just got my Leatherman Charge TTi and I am quite pleased with it. I do a lot of travelling for work and leisure and it makes me feel comfortable to know that I have a set of tools in a light small package that I can work with in case the need arises (fixing loose luggage handles or wheels, setting up camp, etc)The Good- This thing was delivered with all the blades very sharp- The selection screw bits can be expanded (sold separately)- The tool is very light because of its TTi body- All tools have a locking mechanism so that you don't accidentally turn or push them back while using them- A clip and a loop where a carabiner can go through is providedThe Bad- Would have been better if a leather sheath was provided. Im just being picky I guess.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for something that has all the usual tools in a light and compact packaging."
5,This tool is AWESOME!,This is everything I was expecting and more. Shipping was fast and I am happy with the product!All I can say is AWESOME!
3,"Well, it is a Leatherman","Leatherman's were always great. >Wave< was a great evolution, >New Wave< an improvement of that, and this is sort of the ""ultimate luxury version"". It is absolutely fantastic, yet, I would not buy it again. The reason is price: A standard >Wave< costs half and will serve you just as well. I'd rather have two (or spare cash to get a new one, when this will be inevitably lost or stolen)"
3,STAMP COLLECTING FOR DUMMIES,HAVNT READ THE ENTIRE BOOK YET-BUT I WAS LOOKING FOR HOW TO SELL STAMPS AND HOW MUCH THEY WERE WORTH-SINCE I HAVE OVER 10'000 STAMPS THIS IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM-OTHERWISE THE BOOK IS OK-BUT IT ISNT VERY GOOD FOR PRICING OR SELLING
4,Jefferson Bible interesting,"I had heard for years about the Jefferson Bible, so I finally ordered it. It's pretty small, but he included more passages in it--if this is exactly it--than I would have thought. Jefferson's introduction is the most revealing part. It's definitely worth having. For some reason, I thought it would be a full-on Bible with lined-out portions that he found suspect. One wonders what he'd think now, after decades of archeological research has taken place. One has to assume it would have some influence. He includes the birth and death stories, and the parables. I was a little disappointed that he did not elede any of that finger-pointing in the death story, being a creature of the Enlightenment as he was. I'd recommend it."
5,Great insight into a great man,"Excellent. This book gives a glimpse into one of the great minds of the eighteenth century. Jefferson was a true Enlightenment man, and eschewed any kind of superstition. Not a good read for a pentecostal, but great for the rest of us."
1,Warning--These Reviews Are Not for This Edition,"Somehow Amazon has bundled ALL 181 Jefferson Bible reviews together for this one edition when the reviews are actually about many different editions.Heads up: Look at this edition carefully--the reviews are not correct and there are better ones, with better formats and explanatory information."
5,Jefferson Bible,"This edition was very inexpensive, so was not fancy...but it was nice enough and serves my purpose very well. I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't need a hardbound edition."
5,Wolf Woman is a powerful novel seen through Tanith's eyes.,"Wolf Woman is a powerful novel written through Tanith's eyes. In the book you feel all Tanith's feelings, her thoughts. I think that Tanith is physically human, but mentally wolf. She is calm, carefree and happy when she is with the wolves, and, although when she is with her `human friend' Gibran [whom she loves] she is happy, most of her other feelings with humans have been worry, confusion, sadness. Her clan hates the wolves, so when the two worlds clash, her feelings turn to confusion, grief, hatred. Tanith has many different emotions rolled into one, which creates one of the best and most powerful book I have ever, ever, read! I think that the book is good because it is not too unrealistic, like some fairy tales where the good characters never die, the bad guys always die, etc, etc, etc. Tanith is such a realistic book you feel like you're living in the time of Tanith, Woman of the Wolves."

3,"Nice Bag, Poor Construction","Very nice looking bag with lots of storage room. Unfortunately it rips very easily where the shoulder strap connects to the bag itself, and does not take very long to do it."
4,"All Substance, No Kitsch!","This is the first Klezmer CD I ever bought, and still one of the best. I like that it's 16 tracks and 75 minutes long. It perfectly captures the live feel of this landmark concert event. At first listen, it's immediately apparent what a special occasion this was. The music is played with dedication and love. The songs are beautifully sung, and the instrumentation is spot on. There is a huge variety of Klezmer music out there, but this is an outstanding place to start. I highly recommend adding this CD to your collection. It's Klezmer music at its best!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!,"This is one of those recordings that I have owned in all formats! 8Track, Album, Cassette, and now CD. A true classic! Nobody plays like LEon... he has his own style. Very cool!"
4,New Generation Listener,"I was pleasantly surprised when my mother sent me this cd in the mail while I was at college. My tastes run as hard as bands like limp bizkit and korn, but anyone who enjoys beautiful melodies and great songwritting will enjoy this album. The southern flair is a great change of pace. I would recommend this to anyone of my generation, and kick anyone in the pants who has not heard this from my parents' generation."
3,Jackie Chan Motion Captured,"This game has been a long time in coming. Being a Jackie Chan fan, I couldn't wait to see what the game makers would do with Jackie Chan. While the controls are a little sluggish, the motions and fighting all show signature Jackie Chan moves. Jackie's comments while he's fighting also bring life to the game. The only major irritation I have with this game is the long reload times after you die. It slows down the pacing of the game. If you like Jackie Chan, this is defintely one to at least rent. More experienced gamers may be able to finish this game in several days."
3,Over-hyped,"This film was over-rated and over-hyped.Jacques Dutronc is the most boring Van Gogh ever.Never once do you feel he ever painted a thing.And endless female prattle on top of this. You feel you are trapped on ""The View.""The great Robert Altman made the best and THE definitive film on the Van Gogh brothers.That film is highly worth viewing and purchasing."
4,Soul Reaver or Blood Omen ?,"The two games have alot of simularities Example in both you gain special abilities by completing different quest or fights. In Blood Omen 2 the abilities are for Kain while in Soul Reaver2 it is for the Reaver. Blood Omen and Soul Reaver's graphics are pretty much the same, but in Blood Omen there is sometimes problems where it will slow down or freeze which has never happened before with my Soul Reaver game. Despite some problems Blood Omen is still a great game but you should definatly rent this game before purchasing it you might just be able to beat it because it's kind of short but then again so is Soul Reaver. So you should definatly rent both these title's first. Happy hunting."
2,BOOOORING,"From what I had heard of this game from my friends, I expected to be glued to the Ps2 for hours or even days till I finished this ""best game ever."" Then I realized something... this is definately not the best game ever. While the idea of slicing the heads off mutant creatures and rogue vampires and then drinking their blood seemed appealing, I soon found that that is all you do!!! This game is extremely monotonous and don,t get me wrong, I love hack and slash but this game is not even worth the [money] they are asking. Go rent it."
3,Perfect for insomniacs.......,"I never expected to fall asleep playing Blood Omen 2. That's what repetitive (BORING) gameplay will do to the most zealous of gamers. I expected so much more from this overly HYPED game. Instead I got this snoozefest. Much of the game revolves around flipping switches, not my idea of a challenging puzzle. Enermy AI is at an all-time low. Just slap them around like ragdolls. The monotony induces sleep. This game has some of the most poorly designed and BORING boss fights I've ever nearly slept through!!! In some places and battles, the game slows severly due to inconsistent framerate. The only saving grace is the story, characters, and voice acting, which is all excellent. If you think that's enough to make this game worth playing, get it. I barely made it through due to the boring gameplay."
1,THE WORST GAME I EVER PLAYED!,"Now, Im not saying I hate Streetball, but this game makes Streetball look like Sesame-Ball. I bought this game last year for fun, but this game is bull. I wish I bought NBA LIVE 2003! Street hoops doesn't let you create teams and is too easy. I was the Knights and I crushed Baltimore and they had Lil Romeo, all my players were at 50 just to give a challenge and I won 51-0! Its impossible to block but so easy to steal. The movies are pretty good. After a while though, the music in the back gets dumb. I used to be addicted to ""Roll-out"" but now im not. Seriously, you can bet on games on how many points you can win, but its dumb. Some features I like for example: buying your clothes and bling bling. Haircuts look so fake, doesn't even sway one bit. It's stuck to their heads. I RECOMMEND, SAVE YOUR MONEY"
4,Lives up to it's expectations!,"My high expectations for this game were satisfied. This is a basketball game with great design and style. The graphics are quite satisfying and the gameplay is smooth. The audio is excellent. There's even a few music videos you can watch in the ""movies"" section of the game. Another great feature of the game is customizing your player's attire and giving him different tatooes, jewelry, or changing his hair. I also like betting on games. You can bet money and then earn it by winning a match, scoring the most dunks or 3 pointers in a match, etc. The one minor quirk with this game which makes me score it 4 instead of 5 is the controls. shooting and passing to team mates is easy but once you try to rebound or steal it can get difficult. stealing only works sometimes and trying to recover a loose ball is tough because the opposite team usually dives for it and gets it first. Overall a rather addictive game with great style. Opinions will vary, so I suggest renting it first."
3,Interesting,"It was written from a man's perspective, this is true and seemed mysoginistic (as many Black films by video directors tend to be), but it made its points. The acting was apparently done by first-time actors, but at least they looked good and moved around some interesting places. It has a nice artistic flair evidenced by the clothes and the scenery. If this is what low-budgets are lookin like... well gatdam! There must be SOME money in filmmaking. lol Good camera work and art direction styles on this one. I liked it."
2,A Light Entertainment About Interstellar Gateways,"I picked this up quickly as some light reading from a local library. It has an intriguing premise which isn't fully developed. I wish the author had spent more time describing who the aliens masquerading as Iconians really are. You have to be a hard core ""Star Trek"" fan to enjoy his descriptions of the characters. Alas, I did not find this nearly as memorable as the best books in the ""Star Trek"" series written by Peter David and Diane Carey."
4,Dynamite!,"Warning. Once you pick up this book you will find it hard to put down. Exciting, fast moving with wonderful characterizations and a fantastic story. Definately the stand out in the Gateways series so far. And if you are not reading the others you can still enjoy this great DS9 adventure. For those who've been reading the relaunch novels this story follows right on the heels of ""Abyss"" Been wondering what's up with Shar? Been anxious to learn more about Vaughn? Well ""Demons of Air and Darkness"" fills in more of the pieces and does a great job of advancing all the characters while still telling a great stand alone story. The book is full of surprises that I don't want to give away but for anyone looking for a great read full of adventure and great characters I highly recommend this book."
5,Required reading in college,"This book was required reading in college and now 20 years later it seems to take on a different kind of meaning for me. The second read was so much more than I expected. The book helped me be more appreciative, less judgmental of others and gave me insight into life and how to deal better with what life throws at me. We do have choices about how we think."
5,"This is a ""must read"" for all conscious human beings.","Frankl's experiences and the wisdom he gained from them changed the way I see life and the world, at first reading, several decades ago."
5,"Clear, Simple, Profound ...","""Man can endure any how as long as he has a why ..."" To me, this is the essential take-away of this clear, moving essay by concentration camp survivor Viktor Frankl. He recounts how those who survived the ordeal were often those who could find an aim and purpose outside themselves to keep on going. Man chooses his own attitude toward adversity and, in so doing, transcends life's inevitable suffering.A great book which merits re-reading periodically again and again..."
5,Excellent book.,This book was recommended to me by my father but years went by before I actually read it. Once I started reading it I couldn't get enough. It changed my outlook on life forever. Highly recommend this book to anyone.
4,Valuable Text,"Frankl reprises a remarkable circumstance, his experience in German Work/Death Camps during WWII and his inspiring quest to find meaning amid daunting nearly unimaginable oppression. Functions better as a critique of Frankl's psychotherapy predecessors (Freud) than as a tract promoting the unique virtues of logotherapy. Worthy book for those of ""greatest generation."" For ""boomers,"" my coming of age, I would suggest Ernest Becker's ""The Denial of Death"" serves as a more cogent testament and comprehensive critique."
4,Two parts,I was far more interested in the first half than the second half. I heartily agree that purpose trumps pleasure every time!
3,50/50,The first half was VERY good. Best insights into the Holocaust ever. BUT I couldn't finish the second half it was so boring!
4,A super-classic,"Once in a while a great book comes along that revolutionizes the way you look at your life. This book is a super-classic and this edition (with this particular cover) is my favorite one. It's such a great gift idea, especially for people whose lives are in transition, i.e. unemployed, college graduates, milestone birthdays, et cetera. The only reason why I gave it four stars is because I feel that there is a void that the book does not fill; the why is there, it is the how that seems to elude me."
4,Man's Searcg For Meaning,This is a must read for everyone! It is a look at the day to day experience of the Nazi death camps and it is soul grabbing. Frankl allows us to feel his experience and he shows how he and how we can choose to cope with suffering. You walk away with the proof that your choices make the quality of your life. We all suffer on some level. How we choose to experience the suffering and what we do with it when it has ended is what will make the difference in our lives today.
5,Convincing and authoritative,"Frankl's experience in the concentration camps makes this book carry a moral weight that other ""just think positively"" self-help books do not. I've read many books about the problem and meaning of suffering, and this is by far the best. Whenever someone I know is going through grief or other discouraging circumstances and wondering what's the use, Frankl's is the book I recommend."
3,The importance of meaning-making,"This two-part novel is written by a holocaust survivor and later psychologist of logotherapy. Frankl asserts as men, it is not our responsibility to understand fully the meaning of the world, or even to endure the meaningless of life; rather, as humans we must only bear the incapacity to grasp total meaning. Further, every trial encountered is an opportunity to show your character, and hence to assign meaning to your life."
3,Interesting but....,"He survived immense and intense suffering. I thoroughly respect his strength and preference. I did not get much out of the book other than a description of a horrific experience. Ironically, this is exactly what he said the book was not about."
3,Some interesting insights,"This book would be interesting for someone who is really into the psychology of going through trauma. It really analyses what people go through in their minds during trauma, especially during the Holocaust and concentration camps. It was interesting at times, but for me it was also very slow. It took me awhile to finish it, sometimes because it gave me a lot to think about and other times because it didn't quite hold my interest. It inspired me in many ways because it focused on how you can have an optimistic attitude during really tough times and that this attitude can help you find good in every situation. It is definitely deep and I am glad I read it, but not one of my favorites."
3,A slow read but interesting,Thank you for the book a must read for my class. An A- by the way! I loved the price and maybe actually try to get the meaning over the long holiday. Thank you.
3,The 1st Half is a Must Read,"While I am not versed in any level of psychology, I truly believe that every human being on this planet should read the first half of this book. It is awe inspiring, horrifying and make you want to go and hug your children."
3,Man's Search For Meaning (Logotherapy),"This may be the only negative review of this book, but there needs to be a first for everything. This book started off great, recollections of the tradgedies and sufferings that the author (Viktor Frankl) experienced in numerous German concentration camps during the second World War. But the first section, describing the actual war, was intriguing and kept me reading. But with the introduction of Logotherapy, the book started to go downhill, and I lost interest in it, as logotherapy and an in-depth view of human reactions just isn't my thing. So, if you're into psychological text, this is your book, but if you're the action/suspense kind of book reader, you can read the first section. This was just a disappointment after the first section."
5,Profound and Inspiring,"This book is full of philosophical insights. Based on the author's experiences in German concentration camps during the second world war, Viktor Frankl gives the reader a greater understanding of happiness in life by showing how people can find meaning not only through love and serving others, but even through hardship and suffering. He mentions how although the majority of people in the camps became depressed and bitter because of their trials, there were others who preserved a spark of hope by turning their focus of attention outward. This is an inspiring book full of valuable lessons."
5,Wonderful Book!,"My boss gave me this book in the 1960'5 and I remember loving it then. When I saw it for the Kindle I couldn't resist buying it to see if it survived a 50 year span between readings. It did! It is as fresh and relevant as it was then. Despite the fact that half the book is about the Nazi deathcamps, it is a most uplifting book and an enjoyable read."
4,If you like killing inocent people this is the game 4 you,"I liked this game even thought it was a bit slow. You get your moneys worth though, it's long and not too easy. The blood and guts becomes a bit old after the first few hundred people you kill (optional) and I think the creators saw this and so every level or so you find new wepons to use for an ever entertaining demise for the towns people, thugs and other nemeses. I think stars are given out a little too easily these days but I gave it a four because of the story line. One of the only games where I have liked the story line. This game is definatly for adults and not kids so if your stomach turnes easily please, for your sake have a large can or container to vomit in."
4,Almost the best,"Not as good as Motogp2, but almost there. I love bikes, I have owned many and currently ride a ZX9R, so being able to control many different types was a definite plus. Also the ability to upgrade like ""GT"" was a good option. What I felt was lacking was the sharpness of the graphics, like motogp's. The AI's did however improved as you worked your way up in classes. Class S is no joke."
3,a good first novel...entertaining,"come on guys, this is her first novel.anyway, it is absolutely a beach book! i just read this in Puerto Rico on the beach in two days. You become utterly absorbed in the main character. I found it to be a very fresh book and it does have a lot of humor. i look forwarding to reading her next novel"
5,Great Book,A must read for all Marine Aviators. I could not put it down. A true Marine and American. Great addition to my book collection. Nothing better than actually having the book in your hands.
4,Pappy spins a great yarn,"The man lived one hell of a life. I recommend after reading this, you read a biography such as ""Black Sheep One"", by Bruce Gamble. It will shed more light on Pappy's youth and how amazing it is he accomplished all he did. It will also shed some light on some of the creative liberties Pappy took, and on the outright exagerations Pappy made. But rest assured guys like Bruce Gamble are not what it took to win the War in the Pacific, it was guys like Pappy. Pappy was a real fighter pilot, not some academic in a flying computer."
1,"Faulty Product, Horrible Customer Support","If I could give this product zero or negative stars, I would.Not only have I struggled to make this product lock when it is supposed to, but now that it will not UNlock, I called customer support to see what I am doing wrong. Their recommendation: ""You have to break it.""""I have to break it?""""Yes, there's nothing you can do to fix it. There's no special way to open it. If you enter the combination and it doesn't work, you have to break it off, like with a hammer or screwdriver or something.""The woman who told me this was very comfortable with offering this solution.I'm off to go find a sledge hammer so I can take care of it. Would I buy anything made or sold by Digital Innovations again? Need I answer that?"
4,Holiday Memories from the 39th President,"In the short ""Christmas in Plains"" Jimmy Carter shares mermories from a lifetime of very disparate Christmases. He remembers childhood holidays in rural Georgia where his young African-American neighbors might get an orange and some raisins. He recalls the four Christmases he spent as President. A very religious and family-oriented man, Carter has alsways treasured the birth of Christ as one of the highlights of his year. Easily read in one night this is a charming little book. To better understand this complicated and important man, a fuller read is last year's ""An Hour Before Daylight"" which is a more thorough memoir of his childhood years. But ""Christmas in Plains"" stands on its own: a charming, sometimes heartwarming account of a good man and his 70+ Christmases. This deserves to become a minor holiday classic--unlike, say, Grisham's new ""Skipping Christmas""."
2,Could have been way more fabulous,"The trick is simple: Take a smash tv series, handpick a bunch of popular songs and blend them and record them on a CD. Send it to the retailers, promote endlessly on the aforementioned show and wait for the sales to hit the sky. What? That this CD never went to the top of the charts? Hmmm, wonder why.... Maybe because the tunes can be found in previously released albums? Or because the remixes were not remotely as good as expected? Or maybe because the good-for-all-taste compilation didn't quite work? Whatever the reason was, this is anything but a fabulous soundtrack. And it is sad for me to admit it, being a follower of the Fab Five escapades. Kylie, Junior Senior and Fischerpooner sound odd paired to the likes of Jamelia (!) and Ingrid(!!!)A chance to create a sort of groundbreaking work has been missed. Sign of times to come for the soon-to-be-old TV formula?"
4,"Good show, good soundtrack, however...","Love the show, and this soundtrack looks great. But buyer beware...the version of ""All Things Just Keep Getting Better"" is NOT the version you hear during the opening credits of the show. The version on this CD is the newer remixed version which has been featured on the video to the song. IMO the original version (during the opening credits) was far superior and far more catchy. This new remixed version sounds like, well, a remixed version. So be aware of this before buying the CD. But that's all the bad things I can say about it. The rest of the album is great.P.S. If anyone knows where one can find the original version of ""All Things Just Keep Getting Better"" (if it even exists on CD) please let me know. Thanks."
2,big disappointment.....,"I think that many of the previous reviews must have been written by bravo and NBC employees.... all we wanted was the high energy version of ""All Things"" from the tv show... we waited forever, paid our money, and all we got was the mix version from the video (not nearly as good, not even close). This is why p2p networks keep going, becuase corporate America just can't get it right. Why can I buy the song from Gilligan's Island, but I can't buy the Queer Eye theme as it sounds on the show..... that's all I want.... was it asking too much? Big DUH to the marketers, AND to the queer eye guys becuase they thumbed up this CD..... get real!"
3,shiver me timbers...,"wow! feel like i'm 30,35,40, whatever again!!!!!!!!!!!great selection of happy, throbbing, move-your-body mixes.i'm so glad this kind of music is getting this huge chance on a more receptive world. kudos queer eye!!!!tuck"
2,Disappointed,"If the song ""Disappointed"" by Electronic had been included on this disc, then I might not have been so...disappointed. Like some of the other reviewers, I was expecting a full-length version of the Queer Eye theme song. Instead there's a mixed version that isn't very good in my opinion. I feel like I've been duped by the record company. The rest of the songs on the CD aren't bad. The Duran Duran song is pretty good. But my expectations focused on the Queer Eye theme song, which has left my disappointed."
5,This CD is great,"I stumbled upon a Carol Welsman concert special on BET Jazz hosted by Ramsey Lewis. I couldn't believe how awesome Carol's singing and piano-playing was. I couldn't wait to get my hands on her CD's. It is really sad that ""The Language of Love"" is the only CD by Carol available in the U.S. But, it is a very good CD. I pretty much program the album to just play the 8 songs that I like, but those 8 songs are so good, that I still have to give the whole CD 5 stars. I skip all the really slow songs like ""Nightingale"" and ""Every Breath you Take"" and just listen to the more up-tempo, latin-flavored tracks. Carol's version of ""Slow Boat to China"" is awesome. Her scat-singing is so fun to learn and then sing along with. And, ""Coracoa Leviano"" is beautiful. The real juicy tracks are the last two ""Chanson de Maxence"" and ""Senza Fine."" I would happily pay 20 bucks just to have those two songs alone. So, I don't think people should be disappointed with this album."
4,A great games with a few frustrations...,"Word of caution to those that are purchasing this game... as you get deeper into the levels, there is a problem in the coding that causes the game to randomly freeze up when you obtain a hint scroll. According to MidWay Tech Support, they are aware of the problem, but there is currently no fix in the works.The game itself is great fun and the lock up proves to be mildly annoying (you will need to restart the Gamecube and begin the level over.) I'm just surprised to find that MidWay is well aware of the problem and not working to fix it.Thought it would be helpful to know as you purchase this that it does have a small drawback."
4,Fun to play with your kids,Want some bonding time with your kids? Get this game. It is fun to play as a team and conquer all the levels and bosses. Just don't get upset when your kids run ahead and grab all the treasure or coins. I would just level up my character when they were at school real quick so I stayed up with them. I have more fun playing it be myself but can't do that if the kids are home and want to play too. This is just a fun no thinking game.
5,I can't believe I didn't try this game before,"I didn't know about the Arcade version of gauntletbut now that I've played I see why many people say it's greatThis game is not ment to played alone because If you play it alone all the demons etc will finish you up.It's so cool because you can be speaking to you friend and saying:"" Help, me use your magic"". cool uhIf you buy games for there graphics you better not buy thisBecause the graphics are pretty poor but the gameplay is exelentThe more you play with the character the more powerfull It becomes for exemple I like the blue wizard so I only use himat level twenty he became the blue magethat's pretty coolThank you for reading my review"
4,Not too Bad,"This Game is okay. U pick a char and u [destroy].... There isn't a huge story to this game but i'd still buy it. U pick a class of character. U [destroy] and gain levels. When u hit lvl 30 u get a familiar that flys over ur shoulder and shoots with you. each character has unique familairs. there are even secret characters you need to unlock. ratings:Graphics: 9/10 not a huge improvement from N64Gameplay:8/10 solo , 10/10 multi. its really much more fun with other people to play with.Sound: 8.5/10 the music can get annoying but its not too bad.Story: 9/10 fairly okay story and plot.Replay: 10/10 u beat it as 1 character then u can pick anotherclass and work that 1 up.Overall: 8.5/10. its okay but i'd still buy it. ..."
2,okay game,this game [disappoints]i thought this would be a good game but the graphics [disappoint]and the camera views are awful
4,cd,once again its a christmas gift. but came quick and in good shape.and im sure my girlfriend will love it!
4,An excellent cd if you like clasic spanish romantic music,"This is a great collection of this great 70's and 80's group. Mocedades is a conjunction of beautifull and romantic voices that will transport you back to the days of your younger years. Songs like ""Eres tu"", ""Tomame o dejame"", went all around the world, with tremendous success. It's the kind of music that willfullfill your senses."
5,Cutting Edge! .... Hot!,The Punany Poets are Hot .... they are a must see and especially a must read. The pioneers of erotic poetry and much more. I had the opportunity to see them live on stage at club New York and I purchased the book. Jessica Holter is brilliant! The best erotic poetry of the century ... a must buy! Punany:The Hip Hip Psalms ... Forever!
1,dull dull dull,"It's hard to believe a boring book could be made from the life of this buffalo hunter, marshal, politician and businessman but Metz' managed it. According to Metz, Garrett was driven solely by money and ego. That's barely worthy of a magazine article much less a book."
5,childhood,when i was a child i had still and had looked for it for a while when i finally found it i had to get and it was a bit old and used but it works well and now i can watch it with my kids my favorite movie is back in my house.
1,bad movie,i did not even watch all of it this movie is bad and i like movies that make fun of movies but this one is bad
5,Great Game,"This is a great game from my point of view. This game is best to play against a friend, but still is good to play against the computer because of the games hard diffuculty, and the great movie you get to see with the characther you beat the game with. It has great graphics and good playing options, like you can do a tournament or two on two mode, and others such as practice mode where u can find out all your characthers moves and fatalities.I don't think this game has any weak points which makes it 5 rated game. it's fun, intense, hard, and smart."
1,Not what I expected!!!!,"I must start off by saying I did not read the first book and I don't intend too. I was really disappointed in the Character Jada and Wellington. They seemed very selfish. I was upset the Author made it seemed like they would not pay for hurting Lawernce and Simone the way they did. It was very unfair to them. I am use to African American Authors who give a more realistic approach to writing. When I'm reading the situations seems real and even the ending seems real. This did not happen with this book. To think that Jada and Wellington would just be living happily ever after seems more like a fairy tale than real life (I'm sorry this book was fiction, I have to remind myself). I'm glad I did not buy the book I just borrowed it."
2,Disappointing,After reading Soulmates Dissipate I couldn't wait for Ms. Morrison's next novel. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Jada and Wellington. When I saw that they were in Never Again Once More I couldn't wait to begin the book. How could I have known that I would be in for a rude awakening. I was majorly disappointed. The storyline moved too fast and I really wasn't that fond of jada by the end of the book. I don't think Ms. Morrison should have gone as far as 20 years into the future.
4,Yes...great sequel,Never Again Once More was just as good as Soulmates Dissipate. I loved this book and can't wait to read the rest of them. Hoipefullly the last one will be out by the time I get to it.
5,Never Again Once More... Left Me Wanting More!!,"She's done it again! Mary B. Morrison is one of the most TALENED WRITERS I've read in years! This book is a continuation to Soulmates Dissipate, and I can not say enough about it.. I was mad when I finished it because I didn't want the story to end. She addressed so many different things in this book finding true love, to love or let it go, faith, family, health, promiscuity, and deceit.... A Must READ I promise, you will not be disappointed."
5,Gorgeous happy happy fluffy techno music ...,This is one of the best singles I have heard in the last 4 years. I LOVE IT ... Happy happy wonderful fluffy techno music ... you've gotta love it ... - you can see why Neil Lewis closes his gigs with this song ... love it ...
5,Elliott's first CD,I really loved this CD. He has a wonderful voice! Great songs. I would recommend it without question.
5,A GREAT BUY! An awesome debut from a true AMERICAN IDOL....,"I love this album. Elliott Yamin is an amazing singer and this album showcases that. It's a very eclectic mix of R & B with 70's and 80's soulful influences. I am pleasantly surprised at how good it is. Buy it, you'll love it."
3,Great Singer - Great CD,"I love Elliot Yamin's voice and find his humble persona on American Idol really appealing. At first I thought the album was unlistenable owing to either overdone or overwhelmingly bad arrangements and sound mixes which range from dated and sloppy electronic piano work to high school jazz ensemble back ups. (And I still hate the electric piano on track 1) But many spins later, there are real treasures there - especially track 9 Alright - which I play over and over again now because it's brilliant.Turn this rating up to a full 5 stars! (Joncleir revised this June 19 - original May 12)"
3,"I anticipated better, but still one of the stronger Idol debuts.","On American Idol I immediately pegged Elliott as my favorite for his beautiful voice. I eagerly anticipated this album, and overall its not BAD, but I had expected more. I feel as numerous songs sound the same, with just different lyrics and it takes more than one listen to truly differentiate what song I was listening to. The strongest track is ""Movin' On"" and really the only one I find myself wanting to repeat. Some songs, like ""Wait for you"" give me a feel of something I'd expect a boyband to sing and isn't really my cup of tea.As American Idol CDS go, Elliott's is strong and true to his musical stylings, but it did leave me feeling like I didn't get what I necessarily expected out of his phenomenal voice."
4,ELLIOTT YAMIN,"LONG AWAITED CD, ELLIOTT YAMIN. MY FAVORITE, AS PERFORMED ON AMERICAN IDOL, SONG FOR YOU. LOVE THE OTHERS, WAIT FOR YOU, ONE WORD, I'M THE MAN, TRAINWRECK...WAIT FOR YOU WILL BE NUMBER ONE. HE'S SOULFUL, A FUNKY WHITE BOY, AS PAULA ABDUL SAID. WISH HIM GREAT SUCCESS!"
4,Great CD to Get the Party Started,"Nice to put on a CD in the car or at home with your mom or little sister and not be embarrassed. Can't say that about an R. Kelly CD! Great voice, not bad for the first time out."
5,Brilliant voice!,"Elliott Yamin is such a breathe of fresh air and exactly what the boring music industry needs at this time which is a time of clones, wannabe's & sound-mixing fakes. His authentic, BRILLIANT voice & joyful songs make me really happy! Train Wreck, Find a Way, Free, I'm the Man & One Word are exceptional ""stand-outs"". The rest are really good too. Funnily enough, my least favorite song is his big hit ""Wait for You"". It's OK, but too Pop oriented for my taste. I highly reccomend this CD and this singer. Keep your eye on Elliott Yamin, he will be around for decades & thank goodness for that."
2,Elliot Yamin,"I'm a big Elliot Yamin fan and guess I was hoping for more than I got. It has a couple good songs but for me that was about it. If I had heard it before I bought it, I would not have bought it. Better luck next time, if there is a next time after this."
3,Another so-so cd from an idol alum,"American Idol has produced some pretty gifted singers. Unfortunately for them, and ultimately for us, the albums they are producing are sounding strikingly similar. Rather than being true to their roots, many are releasing cookie cutter albums that are attempting to appeal to the same target audience: younger teens who watch Idol. Being a somewhat older viewer, I was looking for Katherine McPhee to release a CD solidly rooted in what I loved her for, standards and showtunes. Elliot Yamin's strength embraced jazz and R&B flavored compositions. Although there are sprinklings of these styles, his CD appears to be, and Katherine's as well, a compilation of various styles with no strong thread throughout. Chris Daughtry and Kelly Pickler excepted, this mishmash of styles may appeal to the young viewer, but I think I'll pass on building my American Idol collection in favor of the tried and true singers of the American songbook."
2,"Incredible voice, but songs lacking","My mind was made up, the moment I fell in love with Elliot on the show, that no matter how bad this album was going to be, I was going to own it. The reason was simple: A voice like that cannot be allowed to disappear into obscurity, as have been the fate of many idols.That being said, Elliot's voice is gorgeous and restrained, making mediocre songs sound halfway interesting. The lack of imaginative, diverse, and real instrument (would love to have heard some serious horn section) is one reason why this album sounds thin and abrupt. The other just boils down to unoriginal songwriting. Some songs have the potential to be winners, but the production side was repetitive, making some of the few-note melodies even more monotonous.Granted, Elliot doesn't have the clout yet to choose giants of the industry to work with, but let's give him some time. So fans, buy the cd, nurture this incredible talent so he gets to pick better producers next time."
2,Elliott Yamin,"Oh Elliott! I was super disappointed with this cd. I loved him on AI & voted for him til he left. Every song on this album sounds exactly the same & even tho I LOVE his voice, these songs were boring!"
3,Elliott coming in to his own on this cd,"I was a big fan of Elliott's on AI and he came through. This is a true R&B album. Moving on and Wait for You are my fave tracks. A couple of the deeper cuts are a bit repetitive, but his voice is fantastic."
3,pleasant filler,"Elliott Yamin was one of my favorite singers from season 5 of Idol. This is his debut album. I don't exactly hate it but don't exactly love it either. The standout track is definitely ""Wait For You"". The rest of the tracks are just pleasant filler."
2,Give Him Songs That Fit His Style,"The 2 stars are for the albums songs, not Elliott's voice. He was my AI favorite that season, because of his unique style. Loved the blue-eyed soul!These song styles are NOT what he does best. The album producers should have, and need to, let him go-with-the-soul instead of trying to fit him into another mold.I'm looking forward to a truly ""soul-focused"" album from Elliott."
3,Choice doesn't equal Voice,"Man, this Cat can really sing. He definitely has that young vocal George Benson.. Donny Hathaway thing happening. Although some of the song writing is ok, for me the CD itself is just average. The production is shallow, thin, cheap, and without warmth. This guys voice is too good for techno-slick nothingness. I was hoping for more of a Nora Jones first time approach with a more organic sound, and real instrumentation. I love Elliots energy on this CD, I just wish the group around him making this record was up to his level. I know Idol geeks love this record, and find it worth the wait. I don't. I'll wait for better Yamin stuff in the future. It's coming."
1,Hell on earth is trying to get through this book.,"I can not remember being MORE disappointed with a novel. Mr. Watson's run-on approach to describing events did not pull me in but bored me. The main character, Finus, spends his whole life desiring from afar a woman (Birdie) for no other given reason than he saw her naked in the woods when he was 13 years old. There is only a passing reference to her being pretty- and none to her being particularly kind or fun.Mr. Watson's interpretation of a relationship between a black domestic and her white employer was embarrassingly lacking. No nuisances, no subtleties.My last example of the degree to which this novel is pathetic is that the undertaker in this novel has a thing for having sex with dead people, or people who act dead. Very unoriginal!"
3,rainy day movie,"this is mostly a story of a young girl who is confused about life and relationships. trying to find the perfect one--if there is one. the acting could be better and kind of boring in some spots--the phone scenes tend to drag on a little too long--- but still it is a good rainy-day movie. and a great one to see a young, charming david duchovny"
4,Great music!!,"I'm a guitar based rocker, and I love this stuff!! Check out a couple of music downloads if you need to before you buy, but at least take a listen!!"
4,Furinkan Blackmarket,"Old Principal Kuno tries to play daddy with Kodachi. Tatewaki would rather boot the old man out the door, however for his sister's sake, he will accept his father, for now. Later on, a strange man appears at Furinkan starting his own blackmarket. The principal wants him gone but he will not budge. Good movie with some great fight scenes. A must for all hardcore Ranma fans."
2,"Movie is middle B class, but the music rocks","I didn't care for the movie that much. Part of it could be the ""Shaking"" camera during the prisoner's appearance, but also it could have been written a little better in my opinion. What I WAS impressed with was the music soundtrack (of which, seems to be unavailabe), containing some of the coolest blues-type guitar I've heard in awhile. I'm considering watching it again to find out who did the music. JP"
4,Route 666 a Supernatural Thriller starring Lou Diamond Phillips.,"A little uneven but Lou Diamond Phillips stars in this Supernatural Thriller. Title star always gives his best, and this is no exception. Enjoyable wiewing for a Fri. nite popcorn fest. Don't expect spectacular special effects."
3,route 666,"some fbi guys are taking a bad guy to prison and are overun by the zombie remains of some former baddies who were killed along route 666.lou diamond phillips stars.if you are too simple to figure it out already,the kids should be in bed before this one goes to the vcr.it looks as though they spent like 200 bucks on this film.there is a bit of suspense and waiting which i dont like,but some do.this one is a real bummer in the chick department.its alright but could have been better.lous youbg guns undertakings were far superior to this poorly planned monster movie littered with long waits and bad actors.the monsterslook cool and when stuff is actualy happening the film really rocks."
2,Could have been good but lost it fast,"Yikes... what can I say.I am a fan for any thing resembling Zombies.That is why the premise of this movie sounded good... But YIKES... after a good beginning this thing went downhill fast !!Choppy film work really detracted from the film.Perhaps it was intended to add some sort of tension or uneasiness, but instead it was simply annoying.Editing !!!!Where was the editing for this movie.Even though they are supposedly stranded far from any help or civilazation, there are two scenes where you can see cars passing by in the nearby background.For you bloopers seekers, the worst example of this is when the mystery phone booth rings. Watch the scene where they are all standing together staring at the phonebooth; you will see a white car in the very near distance drive by the screen behind them from left to right. A good hand tossed rock would hit the car!Not something that will be added to the collection, that is for sure."
4,Meditation on the creative process x 3,Always fascinating to eavesdrop on artists' creative influences and process. The movie could have been longer and I wouldn't have minded a bit. I guess Davis Guggenheim took a page from the guitarists' book---always leave 'em wanting more. A must see for those who love music and / or these guitarists.
3,Could have been better,"I like Jimmy Page and am a fan of the Edge. I really do enjoy Jack White's music. A lot of the documentary was fun to watch, however there seemed to be a lack of chemistry between the guitarists except for the last acoustic piece played.Am a big fan of music dockumentaries, and this aint no The Clash: Westway to The World (which for me is the gold standard in rockumentaries.Just wish this documentary had more of the three guitarists playing together, and some more chemisry."
3,2 hits one miss,"Jimmy Page and the Edge are my favorite guitar players ever. When I heard there was going to be a documentary about them I was excited. However, seeing the same old historical photos and performances from both isn't what I wanted. The focus should have been on them playing songs together, everything else just got in the way. Especially Jack whatever his name is. He was simply not on their level, just because he likes to experiment with making guitars doesn't make him that interesting or relevant. Not sure who would have been a good substitute, Eddie Van Halen or the late Stevie Ray Vaughn. But this movie went for a generational angle, but I didn't buy it. Not worth the hype."
3,"Rent, Don't Buy","I was dying to see this, especially after reading a number of reviews here. I heard so much about the scenes with the three of them together discussing and playing, but it turns out those scenes are maybe 10% of the movie, and the best ones are in the deleted scenes reel. The rest is a poorly edited (scatter-shot, if you will) set of scenes where each musician talks about where they came from (e.g. Edge visits the school where U2 formed, or stock footage of Detroit with Jack White talking over the top). The idea of hearing how these guys developed seems like it would be cool, but there's very little real information in these scenes. If they release another disc of the three of them together just talking and jamming in the same room for 100% of the movie, I would buy that in a heartbeat. It's worth watching once, it does have its moments, but not very many..."
3,Not quite as involved as I expected,"I was really hoping there would be more footage and interation between the three, and there is some, but mostly this is three standalone biographies (each very well done) that would probably have been much more suited for three one hour presentations on The Biography Channel."
3,"Good, but not without Problems","This Memory Card hold a LOT. The standard Nintendo-made card holds 0.6 Megabytes, but this holds 4 entire Megabytes, thanks to compression. So the card can hold a ton, but it could become corrupted very easily. I don't know how stable it is, but I would for sure use it, but back the really important stuff up to a Memory Card 59, or Nintendo's upcoming Memory Card 251, just to be safe."
2,Doesn't hold up - Cover is different,"It's been very hard to track down this movie, after it was released. Now that I've reviewed it, it's not that good; meaning... It doesn't benefit from additional viewings. Perhaps if you're new to it, you'll like it.At no point in the movie does Lena Stolze look anything like the cover art. So when your DVD arrives, it's shouldn't be too disappointing that it has a different cover; the main element being a large red dot, and the young pig-tailed Lena in the lower right corner."
3,"The movie is excellent, but the quality of the VHS wasn't","This is one of the best Zorro movies, with lots of fun and action. But the VHS quality wasn't very good, even though it was brand new."
1,Sucks.,"Do not buy this product. The earphones broke with in a month, followed by the battery case cover, which falls of easily, then the player stopped running entirely. Customers beware."
4,I still have mine,I Have mine since I was a child and I still love it.It's so pretty and sweet.Timeless classic.
5,Truly a pocket baseball game,"Sony hit this one out of the park. For the most part, this is an exact port of the PS2 verison. Missing is player creation in franchise mode, and a few other bells and whistles like rivalry mode. Otherwise gameplay and audio is almost similar, a wonder considering the PSP has three few buttons to work with.Two quibbles through1) The PS2 version tracks pitch history, the PSP verison only tracks balls and strikes2) Load times are really cumbersome."
4,Another great Memphis band.,"First of all, this album should not be listed in the Country section. Secondly, this album should be listed when speaking of the best roots rock albums released in the last few years. Since there are no songs to listen to yet, my best discription of this band is a mix of Blue Mountain, Anodyne era Uncle Tupelo, and a touch of Allman Brothers (with Warren Haynes). The songwriting is very strong, unlike many of the new ""americana"" bands coming out these days. I can not urge you strongly enough to give this album a listen- you will not be disapointed."
3,Worried!,"I too have read the WoT series and I confess that I am hooked! This last book seemed to be like the last two. They are starting to get bogged down somewhat. Too many little characters and too much detail on trival stuff. The story line needs to start moving to a finish. I worry that something might happen to Robert Jordan and that the series will NEVER be completed. Please Mr. Jordan, let's get this ""show on the road""."
4,"It was a great book, but i was not happy with the ending","I was pleased to recieve R.Jordans newest novel in the Wheel of Time seriesbut I must admit I was let down conserning the ending. I enjoyed growing with Randand the fellow characters, it just seems that maybe Mr. Jordan didn't have his heart init this time. I eagerly await his book 8 to this series but I hope he writes the way hewrote in his first 6 novels to the Wheel of Time series. My over all rating of this latestnovel in T.W.T series is good but a great let down in the end"
4,It's worth your time,"I thought this book was wonderful, and although it's not quite as good as the earlier installments, (books 1 and 2 were my favorite)it is a lot better than books 4 and 5, which were kind of slow. I'll have to admit that Rand is getting too arrogant to be likable, which is a shame since he seemed to be a nice guy in the beginning. The thing that bothers me most is that the women characters seem so shallow. I mean, they are always bickering and worrying about their clothes and the like. It gets tiresome after a while. Although it has its flaws, this book is still as good as its predesessors."
2,Can you spell SLOW,I'm sorry but even though I love this series TOLKIEN does better than the book that is advertised above. I have been avidly awaiting the next part and though I've bided my time I am now totally pissed! Come on RJ! Speed it up! Pick up the Pace!!!!!!!!
3,Excellent opening for a path of daggers.,"I have finally seen a pattern to Robert Jordans writing, after he writes a few brilliant books, he has to write a crap one. I mean 700 pages and the plot goes forward two weeks. But the opening at the end is brilliant. C'mon Jordan go for gold in book 8."
2,Weakest of the series,"I'm sorry, but I could have just as well skipped this edition. It didn't contain anything new or interesting. I was very shocked by the lack of action, having been so taken away by the earlier novels. I will certainly wait and read the reviews of the next novel, before purchasing it. Wish I had checked this page earlier."
4,When finished the series will become a classic,"Although it has been some time since I read the latest installment in the series, reading these reviews brings back my enjoyment in all the books. I read the first five one after the other, then caught up to the authors output and had to wait for each of the rest. They were individually worth the wait, with varied and deep characters. It's not Tolkein (that's what makes Tolkein Tolkein). Far better than Stephen Donaldsons Covenant series (now there's a sell-out by an author). Deeper and more adult than Terry Brooks Shannara series (though I love it dearly for its own magic). When the series is complete, if the author remains loyal to his characters, it will win a place among the classics."
2,To rest on one's laurals...,To rest on one's laurals is to write the later installments of the wheel of time series. I feel like I have been taken for a buggy ride... at my own expense. Stick to the earlier parts because they are something else.
2,still plodding through it all...,"Admittedly I have not read the entire book, but it is probably one of the more difficult books I have read in a while. I do not like books that come with their own dictionary of terms, people, places and events. If I read a book, I want to become absorbed in its words and imagery to fully enjoy the story, I do not want to have to flip to the back every other page to learn a new vocabulary word that is part of the fictional culture I'm reading about. I have read some wonderful books that did not require the reader to learn a new culture or language, the authors were able to create an intriguing fantasy world with the language they have at hand."
2,Go ahead and pull your hair out already!!!!,"After seven volumes of Nynaeve snatching her braided hair, I'm sincerely beginning to hope that she either pulls it out by the roots or gets killed off!!!"
3,"Energizer Bunny, Move Over!","Just like the Energizer bunny, this series just keeps ongoing...and going...and going. Personally, I think it has continuedfar longer than it should. The combination of overly intricate sub-plots and the too-long time between releases of each novel has made The Wheel of Time series overly challenging to follow, so that it's no longer enjoyable to read. Hopefully, Mr. Jordan will wrap it up soon and move on to something more exciting."
2,Will this ever end....?,"I admit that I'm addicted - despite the s.l.o.w. progress, constant female bickering, and frequent fashion details. I want to see how this dang series ends...will it?This particular installment of the Dragon et. al. left me feeling underwhelmed. The ending was a disappointment, but I'll press on and order book 8."
2,Enough Already!,"This is getting ridiculous! A Crown of Swords is just the same as Vol. II thru Vol. VI - Rand and friends wander aimlessly for three-fourth of the book, and fulfill another miniscule part of the prophecy! Go read the Eternal Champions series by Michael Moorcock. It is far more entertaining and better written. On the bright side, at least Lan is back into the picture."
4,totally engrossing yet very detail oriented,"The overall series of the Wheel of Time has been a masterpiece. This book starts a downfall of a legend. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great book and series, but I think that Jordan's peak was around ""The Fires of Heaven"". If he were to just let the story flow and start letting the readers imagination fill in the details this engrossing plot could still go on for another 5 books. I still can't wait for the end I know it will be very imaginative with all the plot twists that Jordan has already come up with."
3,"A great written book, that not really accomplishes much in p","While I have, and still continue to enjoy as the series unfolds, i felt that this particular book did not accomplish much in the plot. While some significant events occured in the story line, it still lack the feeling as if anything really was happening. While I still will probably buy the next in series book. I hope that the characters show some resolution."
5,does anybody know about book 8?,"I am an ardent R.J. fan. I don't know where to find out the title of his next book and the release time. But I heard that it is expected next Nov., but i'm not sure. I sincerely hope it comes soon. BTW, ACOS is the greatest book i have ever read. But then, WOT is the best series I have ever read. I hope R.J. keeps up the good work.Will somebody tell me where to get info on upcoming releases? I would be grateful if you'd email me (ramach@ocsonline.com).V.R."
3,"Oaky, but not the best","This book was really quite good, but not one of Jordan's best. True, there were some exciting part, but throughtout the whole book, I felt like Jordan was only extending the series as much as posslibe. Is it really too much to ask to finally end this series so poor pathetic people like me can just get on with our lives?"
3,hmm...fair,"lot of repitition in this book. quite frankly, im getting sick of nynaeve pulling on your braid. still, not that bad. had some decent parts."
2,Molasses moves faster,"I have enjoyed reading the series so far, but the last 3 books have moved so slow it is hard to keep up interest. Details of people and places are repeated so many times I find myself skimming over paragraphs. Character behavior also is frequently inconsistent, with people learning lessons but not responding to similar situations based on the lessons learned. Examples are beyond this simple review, but Nynaeve, Egween, and Mat are the biggest dissappointments. I would like to see more consistency in actions and more realistic human reaction."
2,Plot that goes no where,I used to love this series. I loved the length and the depth of the characters. I am not complaing about how long the books are or that the story will go on for a long time. I am complaining becuase this book could be removed from the series and I don't think anyone would miss it. This is not Jordan's usual work. In previous books he seemed to dwell too long on some details but the story moved. My plan is to wait for book 8 to come out and then give it to my brother who just started the series without ever giving him Crwon of Swords. I am willing to bet with anyone that he won't even notice that it is missing.
5,Love this series.,"This is one of the best series I have read. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes magic, dragons, princes, and princesses"
3,WOT Veteran,"Backstory- Books 1-4 were read in a two year span in the mid nineties, then in '97 I tried to read Book 5. Ugghh after 3 failed starts, the tech boom/bust, seven years in the Navy I completed it in 2004. Clocking in at 7 years its the longest read of my life. The funny thing is that by this time the popular mass had shifted. Ten years ago EVERYONE loved this series, hell so did I, but after Book 10.... lets just say RJ now had some detracters. The time away from the series allowed me to decompress and severely reduce my expectations for a Fantasy Series. We read these stories to escape from our lives and now that I'm older I can honestly say that I enjoy these stories more. In last month I read LoC and ACoS, and I agree that he does overdescribe scenes to there detriment but all in all his storytelling is ENTERTAINING."
2,Have I read this book or not? Do I care?,"I was a fan. I could almost keep track of the action early on, and even the inaction in the later volumes. Yikes, I checked this our from the library, but I can't remember if I even read it. None of the 7 is nearly as good as the best of the Thomas Covenant series, and reading the worst is like taking an mild overdose of tranquilizers - you don't remember what happened, and you don't care"
4,A transition book.,"As usual, once you start reading you can't stop. But it doesnot furthur the plot as much as tie some loose ends up."
4,Should I or shouldn't I buy #7?,"I went through much of the reviews for book #7 and it's pretty split between the pros and cons.I'm almost done with #6, and cannot decide if #7 would be worth reading. Maybe skipping it and jumping to #8? Any opinions? As a whole, I give the series (#1 - #6) an 8. That's it"
5,"Astonishing in scope ... Mr Jordan, please type faster.","An epic novel in an epic series that shows no signs ofa conclusion. Every time a story line gets tied up,4 or 5 others break loose. I just hope the man liveslong enough to finish the darned series. Waiting ayear for each new installment is torture."
2,Falling down.,G.Love continues to lose focus while falling into a commercial black hole. Great potential is once again wasted. Reminiscent of The Black Crowes(first two albums good followed by disaster)
4,totally worth it,"I have to admit, I haven't read any other similar books, but we were given this book by a friend, and have found it very helpful. I'd give it 5 stars, except for the fact that it's getting a bit dated now. (I'm surprised there hasn't been a revised edition.) Anyway, it's full of helpful information and explains just about everything the layperson would need to know. The author has also studied acupuncture and some alternative medicine, so it is informed with that too i.e. helpful herbs, acupressure points, nutritional prescriptions, etc. It very well organized, and the author is clearly knowledgable and at the top of her game. I think she has a good integration between traditional dental advice and more ""alternative,"" for lack of a better word. If you're going to have any major dental work done, you should definitely peruse this book before proceeding. By the way, she includes some excellent advice on how to pick a dentist."
2,not as good as you think,i bought 3 original controllers and this one.everything was great and everybody wanted to use this one but after 2 weeks the controller started to fail and i had to reinsert it to make it work for a few seconds it was so awful that i had to buy another controller from nintendo so isincerely tell you that this controller is just a waste of money
1,One star is too much for this......,"I don't know who gave high rating for this crap, maybe producer friends?!? Keep your money. Except two minutes near the end this is a very cheap movie."
4,Evil?,"This books introduces you to the followers of the Devil Tigers Dharma. For those of you unfamiliar with the Kindred of the East system that means Clan. This guys really make look each other nasty of the World of Darkness like children. While all the other Tradition, Clan, Tribe books always have someone who assures you that they are the meanest of all the groups, they are ussually lost in their own schemes and petty politicing. That's not the point with the Devil Tigers, they have their feets firmly planted on the ground and of all the supernaturals around the World of Darkness, they have the realest agenda. Worth the reading even if you don't play on this system. Be warned though, you may not like all that you read."
2,Beware Kindle edition,"If you're looking to buy the actual book, or the $9+ Kindle edition (which I haven't seen, so perhaps this review doesn't apply), ignore this review. 5 stars, Dods translation is fine, Tolle, lege, and all that.Foolishly I bought the cheap Kindle edition, which turned out to be, apparently, a scanned version with an autocorrect run on it. Typos abound. Sometimes you can reread the nonsensical sentence, figure out that ""or"" should be ""of, "" and move on, though it slows your reading quite a bit. Sometimes you can't figure out where it was messed up, guess at what the sentence originally said, and move on. Sometimes you're forced to laugh, as when ""Roman republic"" is replaced by ""Korean republic.""Four dollars wasted. I'm off to buy the paperback from the used book store."
2,hard to return to Table of content (No list in Go To),"Wonderful book, No doubt about that.And it has good touch or click table of content.But it is problem to return to table of contnets in the middle of books.""Go to"" in kindle does not show anything."
1,"No ""Go to"" available","I bought this book in order for researching porpuses. The ""go to"" feature does not work at all and it is IMPOSIBLE to return to specefic pages as needed. In a few pages book this ""little detail"" would not be a problem."
4,This is a classic,"City of God is a Classic by the Roman-Egyptian Augustine of Hippo -- it laid the foundation for modern Christianity, and destroyed the basis for that religion as established by Jesus, Peter and James, then set down, in what became Canonized Gospel, by Saul of tarsus.I utilized it as a minor reference during the writing a portion of SAINT PAUL'S JOKE ... which might well have been called Augustine's Curse.In it you will learn the philosophy which turned the Romans away from those scriptural teachings which became Canon, and Gnostic texts ... and created the the philosophy of a State Religion that evolved into the Inquisitions, Pogroms and Reformation -- eventually leading to the Holocaust.Read in parallel with SAINT PAUL'S JOKE, you can immediately see where he digressed, and thus created the history of Europe and, eventually, of the Modern World."
1,waste of money,"i got this as a gift from fellow fan club member, and it was a big disappointment. Not only is it amateurish, it gave me a headache while watching. just a waste of money."
3,Timely shipment,"The shipment arrived in an okay time/about 10 days. Not a problem since i wasn't in a hurry to receive it. However, the quality was very poor and it should have been sold for half the price."
2,Not what the composer intended,"In his lifetime,Kern despised jazz versions of his songs. Many of the versions on this disc and on the two companion discs in this series are just that. Verve has reached for, it would seem, the lowest common denominator for its selections. In fact, some of the tracks have no vocals at all, which is strange considering this is a ""songbook""! It is better than no Kern at all, but you will find more authenticity in KIRI SINGS KERN on EMI that anywhere on this or the other two discs. Sorry, but pass this one up if you are a purist."
2,when can I receive this book?,"Dear Sir/Madam:I ordered the book (Order #058-9070537-7702134) ""Solutions Manual to Accompany Applied Survival Analysis: Regression Modeling of Time to Event Data"" on March 15. But I still didn't recieve your book. You have told me that the book's delivery date is 3-14 days. Right now it is already 15 days. If i cannot recieve this book before April 6, I will not need this book.Janet"
3,Only because it is required reading...,"This text is okay, as an MLS student I found it a bit frustrating that it seemed you needed to have a fair amount of knowledge about cataloging before you could understand this book. But, then again, I've never planned on cataloging -- so I got through it okay and can't wait to re-sell it! Otherwise, I have to say that I preferred this book to the other text (Organization of Information by Arlene Taylor) because this book is arranged in a more intuitive way.Good luck, but do yourself a favor and only buy this if it is required."
2,"great artists, but mediocre album","i love these artists. they are some of the most talented and exciting jewish musicians around. but the songs on this particular album just don't move me. they are much more middle-of-the-road and easy-listening then i enjoy. for example, piamenta can absolutely shred on a guitar, yet they have one of his tamer songs here. so if you're into tame and easy kind of pop rock sounding music, about half in hebrew, pick up this album."
5,Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind,This book is an amazing look at the life and teaching approach of the most influential brass teacher of the 20th Century. Well-written with a lot of first-hand accounts. Highly recommended.
3,"Disappointing, but servicable","The graphics are mediocre, the fog and pop-up are dire, and the cars handle like wet fish, but the best thing about SF Rush remains the wonderful track designs, full of wild jumps and shortcuts. The tracks are faithful to their arcade counterparts, so if you want to go under the truck and jump on top of the buildings on track two, go for it."
3,Dont get it,If I were you I'd save my money and by a better game like Driver. Little vehicle choice leaves this game kind of dull.
4,A brief and interesting read,"A chronology of historic events, 1066 to present, in the English-speaking world and the words that derive from or were changed by these events. The events and words are rather selective -- it is after all a fairly slim book -- but it is well-written and enjoyable for historians and etymologists alike. A better browser than reference tool and accordingly recommended as such."
5,Worked very well,"The snorkel cruise I attended in Australia provided snorkel set for free, but I heard bad things about those rental ones, so decided to purchase my own. This Speedo one worked very well, also its cutting-edge design caught everyone's eyes. My friend who laughed at the idea buying own snorkel for only two snorkeling occasions was very jealous of me at the end. According to her, the rental one constantly leaks and fogs, was very annoying. Great deal from Amazon, was worth every penny!"
3,Its okay,"Thats graphics are pretty good but, the controls aren't that great. The camera needs alittle fixing. It could have been way better. Its a little let down."
3,smahing drive,"I love driving games. I though this would be a great game, but it isn't. The idea of driving at great speeds and collecting powerups is not new, but this game does it no justice. The graphics are bad, they seem like a port of some old game that has been on the shelf for awhile, and released for the sake of another title for the xbox. Frame rate is good, and the car handles well, but the developers could have done so much better with the graphis. The music is annoying, and this game is a renter at best."
3,An ARCADE port that is true to the original,"If you like the arcade version of Smashing Drive, this is the same thing. If you are expecting some sort of new content, new tracks, new music, etc... you will be dissappointed. It is a note perfect port and nothing more.The hate filled blasts that serve for 'reviews' seem to be expecting a racing game, or a sim. It is was it is. A budget console port of an arcade hit. Take it at face value and have a good time. I still laugh out loud using the big sonic horn to blow up traffic and plow through the wreckage."
2,"Buggy emulation, inadequate controls","Paperboy, Marble Madness, and Millipede are difficult to control with the 4-button controller, why in the world can't they allow the use of the dual-shock controller joystick? Things would be so much more enjoyable. The thing that made these games a riot in the arcade were the input devices: bicycle handlebars, trackballs,.. the gamepad is a poor substitute and severly hampers gameplay.The software is buggy. Paperboy has hung on us countless times, where I don't even bother with this disc anymore. I would have returned it if I had found the receipt. Gauntlet is true to form, but overall for an arcade ""Classic"", I am pretty disappointed. And I grew up with these games."
5,"It rocks, but is sad at the same time.","DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU HAVE READ AT LEAST BOOK 14, The Challenge Box.I bought both of those books on the same night, and I'm soooo glad i did. The way book 14 ends sends you for a total loop and you really have to start reading this one right away (at least you feel like it) This book is awesome ... the ending is soooo cool. I couldnt put it down until the very end!!"
2,Cheap shoes.,"They're cheap, what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet. NONE.Need to break them in or they'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by.. Brash, I think. They're much better quality and cheaper as well."
3,Beautiful but awkward.,"Beautiful quality bag, and looks like a large purse,but it takes a lot of time to get your pooch in and out. Not for dogs over five pounds. Too cramped for larger dogs because of fold over top."
2,Fair,"this movie would've been better if they had a better actor, fairly decent story line and of course special effects. This is worth seeing once."
2,Boring.....,"This movie had a LOT of useless BORING scenes that were too long. I didn't see the Theatrical version so I don't know if that would have made a difference in what I thought of the film. I don't think I would have liked it much better anyway. There was some cool moves from Riddick and a few nice action scenes, and I do mean a few. The story just seemed scattered. The way they (the bad guys) talked made me so disinterested in the story that I found myself fast fowarding through most of the beginning (which is mostly talking) and other parts that had losts of talking. But don't think Im one of those guys that can't sit still during a movie that has more then just explosions and girls- I definitely have a better attention span than that. This movie was filled with Too much Useless chatter...with little payoff (action, effects, kung fu, SOMETHING). IF YOUR GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE THOUGH, GET THE THEATRICAL VERSION. BTW Pitch Black was an awesome movie."
1,It's not interesting in my opinion.,It's not interesting in my opinion. The action and acting are over the top. The plot is like that of a bad science fiction. Pitch Black is more entertaining.
5,Incredible,"Pitch Black was good, Vin Diesel really made the movie. InThe Chronicles of Riddick he hits a home run. The character of Richard B. Riddick is without a doubt the MOST INCREDIBLE character ever created, you cant name one better. Now granted this movie could have been a tad better in that it needed to show Riddick as more of a stone cold killer but it did show another side of him which was good. If you want to see the cold side of Riddick go playThe Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Buther Bay for the XBOX.But the movie was aweosme, action from the opening scene to the end. Great fight scenes great plot, great ending. This movie is a must own."
3,An entertaining two hour adventure romp,"I enjoyed the movie for what it was, a good action adventure story. I give it a higher rating than I might normally for such pedestrian fare because the characters were engaging and the special effects superb. I really enjoyed viewing the dark and twisted images of the Necromonger world. You have to suspend your belief at various parts in the movie such as when Riddick races with his crew across a triple digit sub zero planet with absolutely no protection against the cold. Despite this silliness, if you're looking for some light fare with plenty of action, this movie is for you. As a note of comparison, if you liked Van Helsing, you'll probably enjoy this film."
2,Unrated edition...a disappointment. Go with the theatrical.,"I liked the movie...when I saw it in the theater. I was incredibly disappointed with the Unrated Edition. I might have liked it better if I hadn't seen the original.The unrated Edition changes the movie too much. Some of the new footage makes some things make more sense, but it also changes the story too much in my mind. Some new footage makes the scenes too long and extremely dull. It's like listening to someone talk a lot and say nothing.They may have added footage, but they have taken a lot out as well. They have taken out some of the great one-liners. They have rearraged some of the dialogue. Once again changing the movie too much.If you really enjoyed the theatrical version, don't get the unrated version. If you haven't seen the original, this one might be enjoyable for you."
3,I wanted so much to like it!,"But when it was done, all I wanted to do was re-write it. Fix it, make it better. It was, to be honest, awful. Absolutely nothing like Pitch Black, which was a solid Sci-Fi movie; this was a sort of sci-fi-fnatasy-horror-mix, and a badly done one. It could have been so good, if only the'd done a bit more reasoning and a bit less wandering around.Riddick is living alone on an ice world when bounty hunters chase him down - blah, blah - the plot gets complicated (unnecessarily so) from there on out. Oh, I SO want to fix this movie. It really had so much potential and it wasted all of it. Just, someone, give me a budget and I swear I'll make it all better...It makes me angry just thinking about it. Grrrr. If Vin Deisel were here I'd yell at him."
5,Still Going,This is a really great series and book 2 is even more interesting than the first. Once the characters are developed it's hard not to feel for them and it's very hard to put the book down.
5,The quintessential sound of the era,"This is one of the few recordings I've owned in 8-track, cassette, vinyl, and now CD formats. The live cuts are so superbly tracked it sounds as though you are standing on the stage with the band. I love the slighly overdriven bass speaker cabinet, especially. Gorgeous vocals and an audience that came to celebrate... a must-have among your must-haves!"
1,Waste of Money,This should be sold as a one tape program that encompasses all aspects of breastfeeding instead of the entire series. Each tape is very short and much of the information is repeated from tape to tape. Save your money and call a lactation consultant or if you need reference material then I would suggest a book.
3,Nat. Audubon Soc. Field guide o North American butterflies,I could not identify all the butterfly caterpillars. I have many different kinds of caterpillars in my garden and would like to know what they will turn into. I recommend that each butterfly picture have on the same page a picture of the caterpillar. This would make identification of a butterfly to be much easier.The book was not concise.
3,overlooked gem,"Meg Ryan and David Morse play a married couple who live and work abroad. Morse gets a job in South America and is promptly abducted and held for ransom. Russell Crowe plays a professional intermediary/negotiator who will negotiate for the release of Ryan's husband. Suspenseful, quality film, widely overlooked, panned by critics upon its release, and overshadowed by the very public Ryan-Crowe romance, which is unfortunate because this is an excellent, thrilling and taut story."
1,damaged,this product is damaged and wont work it will stop all together thats the only problem with this item i bought
4,Great Cast,"Even better story line, taking many unexpected twists and turns. Set in beautiful South American jungle and mountains. Watched twice!"
3,Action with a Slight Bit of Romance,"Russell Crowe, Academy Award winner for Gladiator, turns out that he can pull of a non-epic just as well. In this film he plays a slightly disturbed KNR (Kidnap and Ransom) Officer that gets assigned to a small case dealing with a worker building a dam for an oil company. David Morse plays the captive, stolen right out of his car in Tecala. Meg Ryan plays his disoriented wife that puts all of her faith in Crowe's character. The movie is slow at times. Fast at others. It opens with a great action scene, and people looking for an action movie will not be dissapointed. It was a compelling film and the acting by Crowe, Morse, Ryan, and the long time forgotten David Caruso (who gives the best role in his career). You have to check this one out."
2,Over-rated Game,"This game was anticiated by Tennis fans greatly, but instead we get another ""wanna-be"" tennis game. The graphics are average, the sound is average, the gameplay is below average, and the whole game comes across as boring and too one-demensional. There is nothing new in this Tennis game. Small selection of Players, no Real Long Tournament, no Grand Slams, you cannot create your own player, very limited animation while hitting the ball. This is just another arcade Tennis game, like Sega Sports Tennis2k2, but not nearly as good. I found this game very dissappointing after minutes in playing it. I would not waste your Money on this game at all. Get Tennis2k2, and Match Point Tennis coming out by Xicat in late 2002, and US Open Tennis 2002 coming out in Dec 2002!"
1,LOOKS GOOD BUT DID NOT WORK,"For some reason, ebgames.com released this game on the 18th. i bought it, recieved it and it did not work. It sounded like a junky rental game when it was trying to read it. I tried all my other games, they all worked fine. The game has a big glitch so wait and make sure there isn't any big problems with production....looks like it will be a great game...if this is fixed."
1,Shallow vision of Socialism. Mediocre at best,"Red Son is awful in his superficiality. What could've been a very beautiful statement about mankind, economy and Super-powers ended basically just as another regular Superman story, just with him using another black suit. There is nothing in Red Son about a communist Superman or about Comunism itself. It's just another mediocre Superman story throwing just bits of uneducated and biased ideas and giving hints of him dating WW (who cares about that?).Worse than that, the format make the issues so large they become tiring to read. The cover art is beautiful, but the rest inside it really sucks."
4,Batman,The fact that Batman wears an Ushanka and reminds me of a crazed terrorist was all I needed to see to make me want to buy this comic.
3,Excellent up till the end!,"Millar begins with a superb premise, and while the story drags a bit in the middle, the climax of Lex Luthor matching wits against the Superman is well worth the read. Unfortunately the story doesn't have a denouement so much as a nosedive into an unnecessary ""La jetée""-style ending that drove me up a wall.Also, it strikes me as odd that Superman doesn't take Truth, Justice, and the American Way to a ridiculous extreme, yet somehow being raised in the Soviet Union he becomes a dictator. However, I can see the point given the ""scariness"" of Russia in the minds of American audiences, and it doesn't hurt the story."
1,This was a miss for me,I own almost two dozen Miranda Lee books and generally like her books. However this one was a miss for me. I thought the story line was too predictable and the relationship between H and h was unconvincing.
5,Love this movie!,We got this for my son at Christmas and he loves it! I've loved this movie since I was a little kid so I am glad I get to watch it now with my son!
4,Fun and cool,"This was a pretty cool movie with a fun plot. It's kind of like a furry version of Sherlock Holmes, but if you like Disney, you definitely should like this film, it's funny with lots of memorable bits, and Ratigan makes a great villain."
5,4 Year Old Daughter Loves It!!!,"We stumbled upon this VHS at a garage sale. It caught my eye, being Disney and all. At first, I thought my four year old daughter would be bored at the premise. She loves the movie. We watch it at least twice a week still. It settles her down before bedtime. She's especially fond of the little girl mouse, Olivia. Me, I could take it or leave it. I think the story goes right over her head. It's just not as flashy as the other Disney movies. (That's not a bad thing)."
4,Good!,"I Watched the movie The Great Mouse Detective and I know that a lot of Disney fans and a lot of professional film critics didn't think this was the best Disney movie and while it may be true that this movie isn't as good as the classics like Cinderella, Snow White, The Liittle Mermaid, etc, it is still a good and entertaining movie and I recommend it!"
4,classic Disney,It is classic Disney cartoon. It is just fun to watch over and over. It also marks the beginning of the end of hand drawn animation. It was the first relase of Disney to use computer animation (only one scene).
2,Booooooooring...,am I the only one that found this movie boring and pointless? the characters weren't even likable. no wonder it's underrated. 3 things that make Disney so great are all missing here. 1) Fun & likable characters. None here. Even the villian (though played brilliantly by Price) is mundane and lacks charisma. 2) music. didn't care too much about the music in the film. no catchy tunes or sing-along songs. and last but not least 3) good story. this was hokey and predictable and was not clever or witty at all. I almost fell asleep I was so bored. I couldn't wait for the end. great mouse detective is not so great.
2,Give Me A Break !!! :-(,"Sorry, but how can this be ""complete"" when it does not include ""Hearts of Darkness"" ??? Get a life. Coppola's wife directed it, and he produced it (as far as I know), so where are the rights problems ??? One thing that really annoys me about these 60s-70s directors, who went on about ""changing the world"", when they were younger, but who are now more money-grabbing than the worst studio system. Hey, I've bought two DVD versions of Apocalypse Now already, how many more do you want me to buy??? Maybe I'll just transfer my ""Hearts Of Darkness"" VHS to video, as I'm not so well-of I can afford it all. Thanks, Coppola. ps, your wine stinks too."
3,avoid - stick with the original,"Compare this with the original, which deserves more stars than are in the night sky, and you'll understand why there are editors. The uncut footage is superfluous and silly, and it distracts from the story, which flows ""like a main circuit cable"" in the 1979 version. The only good thing I can say is that if Coppola and the studio had to squeeze ""Apocalypse Now"" for some more money, better to do so with this ""redux"" instead of some god-awful ""Godfather 3""-quality sequel."
4,Images which will never leave my mind,"I won't, I can't, forget this movie. I'm sure--had my draft number been higher--this movie would affect me even more, had I survived Vietnam. The horror. . .Yet for all its power, the film is far less compelling than ""Heart of Darkness"". And Vietnam, for all its contemporary tragedy, is far less tragic than the ""civilizing"" of colonial powers. (Or is Vietnam just a recent addition to that tale of ""civilization""?)After watching ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" yet again and rereading ""Heart of Darkness"" yet again, I was bothered by this irksome detail: Nowhere, nowhere in the film or credits does Francis Ford Coppola explicitly credit Joseph Conrad. The horror. . .the horror."
1,Blu Ray at DVD audio standard.,"While I have not purchased the said disc, I dont understand why put out Blu Ray Discs that dont have Blu-Ray Standards. Apparently the aspect has been played with and no DTS Master or Dolby True HD. Just a cash in, in addition it is a mix of two editions Re-Dux and the original."
3,"Great movie, but where are the special features...?","I love this film. I saw the ""Redux"" at the Academy premiere in July 2001 and couldn't wait to buy the film on DVD for the second time. But I recently saw the DVD and where are the special features? No Coppola commentary? No ""Hearts of Darkness"" documentary"" Great movie, but my original DVD has more features than the Redux."
2,Just watch the original,"'Apocalypse Now Redux' had some new interesting scenes, but many other new scenes are completely unnecessary and a waste of time. This new version is also way too long. Just watch the original."
2,You really have to be kidding me.....,I'm sorry but I just don't get it.This is a long movieThis is a boring movieI could never understand why people got so into this flick. I find it a great chore to sit through.
1,Rating the movie... it's overrated,"I purchased this film having been one of the few Americans to have never Apocolyse Now. I am very disappointed, it is extremely overrated and was over two hours of my life that I will never get back. Not that filling out reviews on Amazon isn't a waste of time either, but the film was way too long with an anti-climactic ending."
4,Too Damn Long.,"Nearly 3 and Half hours! The new scene with the Playboy Bunnies was, well, worth a second look, and there is no doubt that Cupolla erred when he cut the act with the French Plantation owner, it lent so much to the overall understanding of the time, however all in all when the credits roll I don't think you have gained much over the original. Still, if you are fortunate enough to have never seen the original this is the version to see. Just plan on a couple of intermissions."
5,Why the South Vietnamese lost,I finally understood why South Vietnam was lost when Brando's character related the story of Charlie cutting off the arms of children who had received shots from American corpsmen. This may be considered just a movie but merge this film clip with the pictures of beheaded American Marines published in Hustler magazine and we can get the picture that our Christian ethics have no place in war if we want to win and save our sons lives. It really is a great film*****
2,So grotesquely bizzare it gets interesting,"This movie does show man's descent to madness. It drives you mad and leaves you wondering ""what the hell was that?"". In terms of sheer madness and weirdness, I guess it conveys it well. But beyond that it's empty! Dark and ridiculous like Dracula, another Coppola flick."
1,Redux sux,"Apocalypse Now is certainly one of my favorite movies of all time, and the redux is still a great movie, but the original cut is much, much better. Redux has some good new character development, but what it does to Kilgore ruins it altogether. Redux includes a bunch of buffoonish Kilgore clips, turning one of the all-time legendary favorite movie characters into a dork.Stick with the original!"
5,Best 'NAM Film Ever!,"As disturbing as the ending may be, this film deserves a place in movie history. What's so wonderful is the fact that this film, like many others back in the day, makes you think. To me that's the whole point of viewing a movie. This film makes you question our sanity as a nation...Kurtz has his little cult in the jungle, but isn't this country one huge cult as well? Do we really make rational fundamental decisions? What's so appealing about this film in addition to its loose ends, which the viewer is left to tie, is the fact that once you start down the road to unstability of the mind your only way back is death. And now, in modern day America, anyone with a good eye can see that our Vietnam vets will never totally sleep until their names are etched in stone like those on The Wall. War inflicts insanity...that's what I got out of this flick."
4,a must see,"Everyone ought to see this film. (Or films). It's a great price for both versions of the film. My only qualm is that both versions are split over 2 DVDs, rather than having one on one and the other on the other. I haven't gone through any features yet, but it looks like there are quite a few..."
5,When this 1st came out I had to see it twice!!!...,"Ok this is not for the kids. The real horror of what we CAN become. All acting, all characters a 10. Brando and MS. Brilliant. Humanity taken to the extreme. In the end you will ask yourself. WHY. All I can say. Its where we are as a species. Think of Hitler, Napoleon, The Ceasers of Rome, G Kahn, they all had power over people. JFK, MLK, MM, MalcomX, Had it too. One great movie."
5,Well done,"This movie needed a bluray transfer worthy of it's stature and it got it. Beautiful video and audio, it took a long time for this to show up but the wait was worth it."
3,Apocalypse NOW,"Everything that you could want in this movie..Only problem is both the original and REDUX version are spread out over 2 discs so you have to change discs to see the complete movies..Other than that very enjoyable..THE HORROR, THE HORROR.."
3,Memories of Boyhood...,"What's all this ranting & posturing about which is the better version? Is Godfather is a better flick than Apocalypse Now? Is Apocalypse Now 1 better or worse than Apocalypse Now 2? Boys like to pretend they're tough, so we've always loved to play Cops & Robbers or Cowboys & Indians. The Apocalypse Now & Godfather films are fabulously entertaining & well-made, but they're not really about warfare and they're not really about mobsters. They're about the fantasies guys hold dearly & desperately onto as our gender becomes extinct as the dinosaur.Apocalypse Now has a flaw that removes it from contention as a great film about war: the pseudo-analytical narration. Although written by the finest chronicler of Vietnam war events, Michael Herr, it's a weak device, one that works sometimes in coming-of-age novels, never in films. Maybe there's an opportunity for a 3rd version: Apocalypse Sans Voice-over."
1,Beware,Ordered this DVD as a gift and the first copy would not play. Sent it back and the replacement would not play either.
2,Oh get real!...,"What on earth was this??? This is one of those movies which makes you wanna bang your head on the wall. First of all, there are no opening credits! What's the point of that? Secondly, the movie seems like it's taking place on a totally different world. The beginning and end of the film is really dull. The only good parts are the extremely well made war scenes, which only last a few minutes. Other than that, don't waster ur time watching this film."
1,Overrated Garbage,"I've tried so hard to like this movie, even going so far as to watch the damn thing twice. In short: It's boring as hell."
4,5 star movie 4 star dvd,"First off to the people complaining about the aspect ratio. It was filmed in 2.35 but framed on dvd for 2.0. The reason is because of cinematographer Vittorio Storaro. He does not like to letterbox at the full 2.35 (see also Tucker:the man and his dream. Which he also shot for Coppola). Although I don't agree he was the artist so it was his decision along with Coppola. It is still better and you still see more than in full frame pan&scan. My problem is where are the extras. I would have liked the destruction of kurtz compound as a bonus like on the first disc. Where is the making of, or a documentary on the restoration? Where is Coppola with an audio commentary (Busy with the ""Godfather"" one I guess). It is still a masterpiece movie and the additional scenes are needed. It makes the film feel more complete. Despite the fact that there are no extras any fan of the movie or classic cinema should get this."
3,Three,Slow-roasted sax sensuality nestled above time-taking live support is another commendable-but-hardly-admirable niche offering.
4,A Sloan Bishop Review,"MKT is all of the charactors from MK 1,2 and 3 with 3's story. If you like the old school games, you'll love this one.Pros:*Features over 30 charactors.*Has many fun codes and cheats.Cons:*Very outdated graphics(that's a given).*Very, VERY hard to beat.*No secret charactors to unlock."
5,Hours of fun and frustration for little $,"I have had this game a couple of years. When I want a challenge, this is what I sellect. If I can't afford to be all wound up and mean the rest of the day I don't play it. It is UNREAL EVIL hard. I finally figured out that I can't play with who I WANT to fight with---I fight with Kung Lao because my fingers work the controls best for him. The graphics are really good----dated yes, but still very good and certainly tolerable for anyone. I have broken out in sweats and cursing fits that no other fighting game has ever caused and I have played most of them and own quite a few. I could play all the other 2-d fighters blindfolded and do better. So the deal is---if you want evil hard---here it is--this game has your name all over it. The only way I have been able to beat a boss is by using the code to open up the option to reduce damage--it reduces damage from the boss too but makes for a long grueling fight."
4,great for a second car,this is great to have. now you don't have to keep switching the car seat base out of your car when someone else has the baby.
1,Test it before you purchase it!,My husband and I have found this base along with the evenflo base that came with our travel system to be unsafe and a hassel to install. We have had to put towels underneath it to make it tilt back enough for our newborn. It only secures at one end so the other end flops up and down. Fits great in our SUV but to big for our car. If you go to a Babies R Us store they have an acutal car seat that the let you strap any carseat and base into to test it. Don't make our mistake. Test it before you buy it.
2,Elevator Bensusan.,"Yuk. Not because of Pierre Bensusan's efforts. In fact i respect and understand his attempt to try something a bit different. The problem is, I just dont like this kind of music.This is not solo guitar with some vocals like his other albums, this is fully produced, jazzy-mainstream new agey music. It would work well in an office or elevator setting.NOT the heart felt solo guitar chops and vocal genius that his other recordings capture. If you get the pleasure of listening to any of his other albums, you will think its an entirely different musician. This is so different, i have to say its Pierre Bensusan, ""NOT""!I reccomend ANY other album by Bensusan, besides this one. Unless, of course, you enjoy mild, new-agey, jazz instrumental albums...if thats the case then you may like it."
1,Parents be forewarned! This is a troubling film.,"Be forewarned!.....This is a sad movie. I don't agree that this movie is a comedy nor is it a family film. I lost my best friend who was a girl unexpectedly at the age of 7. My parents in their wisdom thought it best that I didn't go to the funeral home and see her lying in a coffin. I feel the producers of this film should have included a warning. I felt violated by this film. Although death is a natural event, this young girl lacks any spiritual understanding of death. Like so many films today that call themselves ""Family Entertainment"", there is no God and consequently, no hope. I'd steer away from this one."
5,One of the Best Movies Ever,"This movie first came out seven years ago when I was only fourteen years old. At the time, I knew just from seeing the commercial that I just HAD to see this movie if it was the only movie I saw all year. It turned out to more than fulfill my expectations. Anna Chulmsky is an amazing actress in this movie. She is adorable as the intelligent young Vada. She also does an amazing job at conveying Vada's thoughts and feelings. I have seen this movie seven or eight times by now, and I still cry every time I see it. If you want a lighthearted movie for your kids to enjoy, this movie isn't it. But if you're looking for a high quality tear jerk, pick up this one."
4,Wonderful; worth a good cry!,"My sister and I were sobbing in the theater when we went to see this movie. We'd heard it was about death, but were amazed how totally we would fall in love with the characters, particularly Anna Chlumsky's 'Veda', and their story. Every time this movie is on, I have to plop down in from of the TV and watch it. The entire cast is wonderful, but Chlumsky's appeal really shines. This sad, sweet and touching film will make you laugh at times, cry a LOT of the time, but leave feeling just plain warm."
3,Watch for the new artist Grammy syndrome.,"Whaaat? She sounds a little like Billie Holiday on a warped 33&1/3 record. I remember when evvybody raved about Erica Badu's ""Baduism"", and she then got a Grammy for it and then she rushed and put out that live album which was essentially ""Baduism"" redux with ""Call Tyrone"" and a few ol' skool jams on it....the entire endeavor should have prompted the Grammy judges to recall the award...anyway, hopefully Macy can avoid all that and put out good calibre jams in the future, this is an ok CD, but her best is yet to come."
4,"Funkadelic? DAWN SILVA? OH,, its MACY","Straight feeling that band that's kicking behind Miss Gray. Her Voice is so abstract until I'm almost feelin it. Now if she had some P as in p-funk vocalist queen funk diva D. Silva, adding her flavor to them bizarre melodies,, oooh them 2 together would knock down all barriers and obstacles."
2,Nothing new here...,"This is what all the hype is about? Retread funk... and that voice... if Butterfly McQueen could make a record, this would be it."
3,Grammy Hype,"After the endless Grammy hype about this album and Macy Gray, I had to purchase a copy for myself. I now see why she didn't win! Except for the radio singles, the album is weak and emotionless. I have tried very hard to like it, but I just can't get myself interested. If I can offer any advice, spend the money you have allocated for this album on either Shelby Lynne or Sarah Nicole; you'll be much happier. Sadly, in a year of horrible new releases, this album earned 3 stars."
3,That voice! (a review from the other side of the coin),"Like Caz (the most helpful 5-star review), ""that voice!"" is exactly what I said when I first heard of Macy Gray. Unfortunately, I couldn't say it with the same reverance that he did. Anyway, in today's music business, it's usually a good thing to have a fresh, distinctive sound, rather than jump right onto the Rihanna/Beyonce, etc. bandwagon, but sometimes too much uniqueness can be a bad thing rather than a good one, and with all due respect to the fact that she sounds like no one else, Macy Gray's voice is just not a pleasant thing to hear. It's a shame, because from a non-vocal standpoint, the album has an earthy freshness and a lot of the originality that normally makes for something really great, and I'd probably be giving it 5 stars if it was sung by just about anybody else, but her voice, grating at best and scary at worst, really destroys a lot of this album's promise."
4,Very Impressive Sound,"Macy's vocals, music, & energy keep this album bumping! I love that her voice is so different & challenges the R&B stereotypes of soft female voices. I think Macy has a flair for the funky & she's definitely unusual. I dig the album & I hope she keeps churning them out!"
2,"blah, blah, blah","I guess i'm the only one who didn't like this CD. All the songs sounded the same. She does not have a great signing voice/talent, although it is unique. I only enjoyed 2 songs, I Try, and, Sexomatic."
1,Best Newcomer Title - Highly Deserved,"By listening to Macy's music alone , I was intrigued, but not sure that she'd earnt the above title . But after a visit to the Barber shop this weekend I'm left in no doubt - Macy is one a million, and she thoroughly deserves this title.A few of her tracks on the album have a very adult theme, and it's this style that was embraced in a recent interview with Q magazine - which I read whilst getting my hair cut . When asked what was the most unusual thing she'd done - Macy replied ""I've tasted Myself"" ! .... [Yea - ""Best New-comer"" - for real ] ."
2,Not worthy of the hype,"The first song will funk your brains out, but it all goes downhill from there. Don't get me wrong here, there are some good grooves and sounds, and I think she is extremely talented, but this collection is just nothing special. Most of these songs bore me, and I find that the predominiately funky rhythms do not seem to mesh well with her voice and lyrical phrasing. I'd wait till her next one comes out."
5,Everyone Will LOVE this CD!,"Macy Gray's CD is a great combination of Hip Hop/R & B/ Jazzy alternative music! I got this CD the other day and have not taken it our of my CD player! It is not about love in sappy terms-it is about her struggles and trials when meeting someone, and while trying to walk away! A MUST have for everyone! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!"
1,"Great lyrics, bad songs.","Ok, the lyrics rule, but... um... ah... Macy can't exactly sing... period. The instrumentals and synthesizers and beat and vocals are god-awful-terrible. I think Macy can do better."
3,"Overrated, Don't Believe the Hype","I'm not saying this album is terible, it has two or three pretty good tracks(The albums singles).I'm just sick of haering how amazing it is. It simply isn't that good or special.It was a good idea and the style is a breath of fresh air. Just not as fresh as everyone is saying."
1,Puh-lease!,"I can't turn my radio fast enough when I hear ""I Try"" coming on. It's like a car wreck. You don't want to see it, you have to turn forcefully away, and if you do see it it will haunt you. Her voice is ABOMINABLE, like fingernails on a chalkboard. The fact that anyone likes her is more proof that if you're just over-the-top horrible, some people will take it as a sign of greatness. Get Biz Markie as your vocal coach, have some songs written professionally for you, and you too could be a star."
2,"overrated, and not the next big thing","This by far is the most overated CD of the year, Macy Gray's voice is just annoying, and she doesn't right her own music(just lyrics) so she is is not as talented as everyone thinks she is. She doesn't come close to Me'shell Ndechello, Dionne Farris or Lauryn Hill. I TRY is the only song that can hold me teenage attention span."
5,this one's a keeper,"after some apprehension, i finally broke down an decided to buy macy gray's cd. honestly, when i saw her video for ""do something"" earlier this year, i wasn't crazy about her billie holiday/erykah badu-esque style (even though i do love erykah badu). but after ""i try"", i was hooked. i had heard that the cd was good, and i wasn't disappointed. i don't fast forward through any tracks, and i particularly enjoy ""i try"" and ""i've committeed murder"". gray is a refreshing new artist, especially since most of r&b's new acts are basically sh*t, singing about sex and money-making with lyrics like ""so like a basketball, i had to bounce"" or ""eat you up like reese's pieces."" yeah, gray's voice isn't for everybody, which accounts for all the negative reviews. but it works for me, and a whole lot of others. that's why ""on how life is"" has been in steady rotation in my cd player amongst d'angelo's voodoo and maxwell's urban hang suite."
1,Sweet Agony,"As bad as the cover suggests, ""Sweet November"" is not really a movie but a long soap-opera episode featuring Keanu Reeves, Charlize Theron and a bland Enya soundtrack (yup, Enya. Sounds good, huh?). Essentially a cliched, tiresome and utterly tedious romance, this corny chick flick manages to deliver two or three decent scenes (mostly due to the solid Thero performance) and a lot of uninteresting tearjerker moments that drag endlessly. As entertainment this effort just falls flat, and as food for though it`s equally inane and useless. Nothing new or exciting here, I`m afraid, but I can`t say I`m surprised.Insipid and forgettable."
2,Does Keanu pick his roles?,"Myself and a couple of my college buddies were watching tv the other day and on was Sweet November. Of course we have heard of this film before, but it most certainly did not intrigue any of us. Yet, this time was different, Keanu was the worst he has ever been. There seemed to be nothing behind his eyes, just nothing. Does Keanu pick his own roles, or just the ones he thinks are really not for him. Theron does an ok job in this flim, but she is no Monster. Well, i would suggest never watching this movie, unless your significant other states that they must see it. I mean...my college friends sat through it."
5,the Great Ella and the Great Gershwin are a Wow!,"I love George Gershwin's music and I buy all that I can, but this has got to be one of the very best ones. Ella Fitzgerald is wonderful and this is three discs of great songs done with a jazz edge, yet not wigged out like so much jazz these days. She stays singing just in the groove, with the songs and beat of the music driving the song, not her very excellent voice only, but the combos playing behind her. Nelson Riddle is one of my all time favorite orchestra leaders. It all makes a great set of cds and the music is the best it could be, and I have Rosemary Clooney and Frank Sinatra doing the same songs of old. I have Michael Feinstein singing new music of Gershwin, and Ella does it best of all."
1,Fruit & Branch Mangler,"This picker will get the fruit, but it usually gets some of the branch as well and sometimes rips off a whole branch. It pulls the fruit off. If the fruit does not come off easily, which my oranges usually don't, I have to pull hard. When the fruit finally comes loose, the back snap of the branch sometimes causes other oranges to fall to the ground and get bruised or broken. The wire hooks can damage the fruit unless you are very careful.The wire basket can be difficult to thread through the branches. It is also difficult to grab a single fruit in a cluster.Get the TwisterPicker also available here on Amazon. It beats the wire basket hands down. Read the reviews there before you buy here. Here's the link:Fruit Picker, the TwisterPicker"
3,more autobiographical than current news,"Although I appreciate the narrative and history of the author's journey with her beloved dog, I found much of the treatment information dated, which, of course is understood, and although I appreciate her willingness to share treatments and food choices, I have found newer books with updated facts more helpful. I find I don't the emotional energy to spend on a story at this time. I need information to compare to my veterinarian and oncologist's treatment suggestions."
5,A long over due book with information for dog Moms and Dads,This book is filled with easy to read information that can be understood by everyone. The author writes with compassion and understanding for those people who have dogs with cancer. Laurie Kaplan has written a book that gives readers a sense of hope that there is something that they can do to help to make their dogs live longer with a good quality of life. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a dog with cancer.
5,One of the Greatest illustrators,"The late John McKim was without a doubt the greatest fly tying illustrators ever. He published several of my fly designs in Western Outdoor Magazine. In this publication, he included my ""Yuk Bug"" in this book. He truly was the master in fly tying illustrations."
1,game is horrible,Game is horrible dont buy definitley a waist of money. The most boring experience ever.
3,Who ever told Will Ferrell he was funny????,Too bad. This could have been good if they did it seriously but with some humor. This was just dumb. The T-rex and other effects are cool but not enough to save it. The tv series is much better even though old and dated.Will Ferrell is just not funny even in a stupid way. It is worth a rent and a watch but that's about it.
1,Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen,"Land of the Lost stars Will Ferrell, as Rick Marshall, a scientist. It was so bad, I left the theater 20 minutes into it. First off, what's up with the cheesy special effects? (aliens) I guess that's supposed to be funny, but it's not. Right before I walked out, a dinosaur was running after them, and they stoped to take a picture, so that they had proof, of this new world. Yeah. I will tell you straight up that I'm not a Will Ferrel fan, so maybe this wasn't for me. But this is so utterly dull, uninteresting, boring, and idiotic, that I couldn't even watch it."
2,Land of the Lost,"Product arrived fine, good shape etc. Movie itself was just okay. NOT one of Will Farrow's best."
1,I'd give it a zero if I could,"I bought this Blu Ray thinking that it would be a good movie to watch in HD...Will Farrell comedy with dinosaurs...This has absolutely got to be the worst movie I have seen in the last 10 years or so. It lacked humor, a plot and anything remotely appealing. I was so disappointed that Will Farrell stouped this low to make a movie that was this bad. I am going to be taking it to Movie Stop and trading it in...that is if they will even buy it."
1,Atrocious - not even worth one star.,"This is without a doubt the worst remake/""homage"" of anything I've ever seen. It's not even funny on it's own merits. The only decent thing in the movie were the Sleestak, who actually look very menacing. Outside of that single scene where the Sleestak horde menace the group, this movie has absolutely nothing to offer."
5,love it,I grew up watching the tv series. And i liked that they did there own spin on it and it worked great!!
1,stay away from this movie,"I have seen many movies,and I am a huge Will Ferrel fan.Will got paid too much in this ""piece of c--p"" movie. There wasn't any plot. The story was all over the place. They threw in some dinosaurs, and a pool scene. Why sit around and watch junk, you will thank me later that you passed this stupid movie up. If you want to see Will in the only good movie he has made. See Stranger Than Fiction. Even his most recent movie was a flop. I consider a flop when you experience ""forced laughter"". The recent movie I am mantioning is The Other Guys. take care and happy viewing."
1,Die Will Ferrell,"How dare any of you on here praise this trash. I hope EVERYONE involved in this awtrocity gets severe intestinal gas.These losers took a BELOVED Saturday morning cartoon with MORALS and VALUES and turned it into degenerate TRASH. Thank you CLUELESS Hollywood libtards for yet MORE smut and filth.Raunchy, awful language with sexual/gay references. I am NOT a liberal and nor do I apologize for my truthful words here. This is a prime example of what is wrong with America.10 thumbs down and negative 5 trillion stars.UTTER Garbage.And WHO was that nasty thing playing Holly??"
2,Juvenile,"Some of Will Ferrell's work I enjoy, and I hoped to enjoy this movie as well. Sorry. It failed miserably to keep up with the hype of the trailers. Juvenile in imagination, and jerky, at best, in plot movement (was there really any coherent plot?!?), it was a big disappointment. Might be pretty good to keep over-active 6 to 10 year olds occupied for the duration."
1,Awful,"Don't bother. This movie makes no sense. And not in a good way, like Anchorman. What's with the 1960's Star Trek villain? What was the budget for this P.O.S.?"
3,So stupid it's almost good,"2.5 Stars. Yes, this is a very stupid movie, intentionally so, but, even so, it was kind of funny. Would I spend money to buy this? No. Would I watch this more than once? No. Even so, Will Ferrell saves the movie from being a complete disaster.Not recommended."
3,"Funny, Good but not Great","Will Ferrell is kind of hit and miss for me. Some things he's very funny in, other movies of his I can't stand.I liked this one because it was reminiscent of the 70s TV series, which I used to watch when I was a kid. It had lots of in jokes that would only be appreciated by someone who has seen the original TV show. Some of the jokes fell flat, but overall it was funny.I would recommend this anyone who watched the TV show as a kid. Skip it if you haven't seen the TV show and/or don't like Will Ferrell."
1,Should have Lost the Script and Saved the Budget,"If any film deserves a ZERO, it would be this one. Its uncertain what ""genius"" thought turning the Land of the Lost kids show into a comedy was a good idea. The premise was ripe for a good action-adventure. Instead, Hollywood gave us a comedy based on a script that seems to have been written by a couple of 12 year olds. If you're a legal adult, you're about five years above the most clever bits of humor. The rest is just pathetic. In fact, its worse.The visual effects and acting are both adequate but haphazad. Those are truly the only positives you can say about this film. I saw a couple reviews saying you have to ""open your mind"" to enjoy this film. I'd say that you have to open it with a chain saw and let your brains spill on the floor because this film is simply bad, bad, bad!"
3,FUNNY :),"If you are bored and have nothing to do and in the mood for Some Comedy to make you laugh, I recommend you watch this movie! It is funny and enjoyable you won't get bored I promise, its kinda silly but silliness is amusement :)"
4,excellant biography with an axe to grind,this book ought to rank with the best of the kerouac biographies. while the noted ann charters bio (kerouac) isgood and the nicosia bio (memory babe) is one of the best it is this one that really gets into the seamier side of the beats and kerouac. this book by his former editor falls short though because of his constantly grinding his axe on homophobia and anti semitism that aside it is still one of the best
1,what happend to good movies?,"this movie was just like the first one...raunchy and tasteless and pathetic. the first one had its moments of great humor but this one was a remake with more dumb sub plots.I watched the movie and realized these were absolutley perfect looking teens who went off to college and did the exact same thing they did while in high school which was to go to keg parties and try to stick their d***s into as many girls as possible. I pray American Wedding is the last of this god awful series of party movies. Although this movie may be a good educational tape for parents and may promote good advice: dont send your kids into college, make em go into the military and learn some discipline cause thats what our generation needs today! And a shout out to the makers of American Pie, Loser, Road Trip, How to Deal and so on: stop making these awful movies! your making my generation look bad!"
3,If not for Stiffler......,"Well the loveable losers are back. This time they are on summer break after their first year of college. They all go back home and are trying to make sense of things like what has changed and what hasn't. Oz is still the sensitive one, Jimbo is still the idiot, and Stiffler, who carried all three of these films is in rare form.(...)The one dude who is clearly the biggest geek of all. I can't even remember his character's name. He's the one who got the 'Bible' from the library. Well he's all concerned about his ex being just a friend now. This guy is just nausiating to watch. He's twice as pathetic as anyone in the movie.Finch by the way learns Tai-Chi and finally gets Stiffler's mom in the car."
5,American Pie 2 outdoes American Pie 1,"Fantastic movie! :o) Anyone who loved the first, would love the second all the more. With the male hormones out and about, through all their mistakes you laugh and laugh. I have watched this movie many more times... it is one that you can watch over and over and always notice something new. I would reccomend this to anyone with a sense of humor who isn't a ""prude"" :o)"
3,Not as unforgettable,"With the name ""American Pie II,"" the movie sounds as if it will be more of the same hijinks. Instead, we do get a continuation of the guys' lives, but we are watching a maturing in some of the guys, which does not meet our expectation.This movie tones down the nudity here in the R version. Although the characters still have hang-ups about sex, it is not the same degree we saw in the first movie. All of the same characters appear again, but the women from the first movie don't have the presence of the last, with the exception of Alyson Hannigan's character. It feels as if they were included into the movie as more of an afterthought.The movie doesn't really offer anything new. The trailers shown on TV show most of the humor for the movie. This is something to watch on cable, but I would not recommend buying it."
3,Unrated-not really,The movie is not bad. They reel you in with the unrated but I didn't see it. The first one showed a lot more.
1,Do not buy Full Frame,"Do not buy full frame movies. Order the Widescreen version of this movie. To find out why, visit the Ultimate Guide to Anamorphic Widescreen DVD (for Dummies)!"
3,American Pie 2,I thought I had already reviewed this product. it's okay.. gotten for friends that like them.I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
5,The Best Part of the Pie,American Pie 2 is a sequel that is better than the original and better than the 3rd one.No denying that this one is the best one of the series. FAMOUS SCENES1)Lesbian Scene 10/102)Super Glue 10/103) Trumpet Scene 9.2/104) Jim on Stage 8.5/105) Phone Sex 8.7/10MORE!!!!
3,It was okay. Only a few funny moments.,"I thought the first movie was better. You can probably count all the good scenes on one hand. As usual, Stifler is pretty funny."
5,One of the Best albums ever made,"""Majestic Warrior"" may have sold the most, but this is the best Return to Forever album hands down. In fact, it is also the best fusion album and quite possibly one of the best albums ever produced. No one is better than Corea in mixing accoustic and electronic instruments. Clarke reaches wonderful heights as well. Al Di Meola's best work is yet to come at this point (see Elegant Gypsy for that), but he excels on this work, as does Lenny White. This is one of those ""You are stranded on a desert island and can only have one album"" kind of albums. Even my rock friends like this one. The whole album flows, from beginning to end, and not a bad song or dull moment in the whole program. Love it."
2,Hard to tell the forest from the trees,"While there's a lot of good details in The Era of Good Feelings, it is probably best left for the scholars and researchers. There are great details about the Treaty of Ghent, the Second Bank of the U.S., the Seminole War, Monroe's diplomacy, the Missouri Compromise, and the Presidency of J.Q. Adams. There's also a nice chapter on the first wave of the Industrial Revolution. While the Era of Good Feelings is generally associated with Monroe, this book also includes the Presidency of Adams to round out the bridge between the Treaty of Ghent and the Jacksonian Era. When Dangerfield puts the story together, however, it is not as approachable as other tales of American History. There are too many references to unexplained names and events that leave the novice historian with too much work to piece the whole story together."
3,Honest but dry,"It's clear to see that Anchee Min was a beginner when she wrote Red Azalea. If you appreciate vibrancy, you will not find it in this book. It is a stark autobiography that delivers in a very direct fashion. I would not recommend this for a reader who wishes to be entertained."
2,I was let-down!,"I was excited to read this book, because I collect Asian culture books. I did not enjoy this one! Anchee Min has a beautiful way of writing ( if you can overlook the fact that she does not use quotations ) I kept reading thinking there would be some valuable content only to be disappointed in the end. I don't even know why I stuck with it to the end, I guess it was because I didn't have another book to read.I can see Anchee Min writing poetry, I'm sure it would be beautiful.Red Azaelea was boring.I had just finished Falling Leaves by Adeline Yen Mah. It was wonderful. Red Azaelea...disappointing!"
4,A Winding Novel,"The writing style is dry, but still very evocative, and the story changes pace and surrounding so often that the book feels like a snap journey. A great read for an unsettled mind."
5,One of the best books I've read.,"I've never read a book so fast. I was at work when I read it but I just couldn't stop until I finished. When I read, ""reads like a novel"" I almost put it back because I don't normally read fiction but I'm really glad I got it. This book is amazing. This book deals with such powerful personal feelings. It's too bad that many people who've reviewed it here seem to have glossed over the point of Anchee's feelings. After reading it I was speechless. One of the things I liked best about the book is she talks about the hope and joy when things are at its worst. Not because it's uplifting or anything, but because it shows how the small joys become so important as to become obsessive.It's a feeling that cannot be easily described. Nor can the book. Reading the book was a beautiful experience and I would highly recomend it to anyone who's interested in anything. I will buy whatever she sells. Anyone know where I can find her photos and paintings? doreme66@hotmail.com"
4,And Then?,"I enjoyed reading Red Azalea even while squirming at the control and lack of sensitivity of the Communists, the Red Brigade and the way people believed in Mao and his Little Red Book. It is very scary to see that a country with such an enormous population could get to this state. I would really like a book by Min about leaving China and how she felt when she came to the U. S. Is she a citizen?"
4,"On edge, but really great movie!","This movie is one that really has it all. It has the warm fuzzy cute little family feelings, the on edge what is going to happen, suspense, creepy-ness and also the icky little bit of gore.I think this is a great movie! Plus the little girl is just so adorable!"
3,"Ok, but too many plot holes along the way.","I purchased this movie based on the overall excellent reviews and was a little disappointed. It's not an awful movie, but to me it was just Ok. The performances are fine and it does have its scary moments (I admit, I about jumped out of my seat a few times). But there are so many little holes in the plot that eventually it becomes impossible to ignore them. Still, I tried, hoping that the ending would make me forget the improbable moments. But, as with the rest of the movie, the ending didn't ring true to me either (though obviously I can't explain why). I can't help thinking that a few tweaks to the screenplay could have produced a far more believable story.This movie was recommended to me by Amazon after ordering 1991's ""Shattered"" with Tom Berenger. While both are rather obscure movies of the suspense genre, I enjoyed Shattered far more than this."
1,Drab.,Overblown dramatic moments interspersed between Ms. Hawn's costume changes. I prefer her in comedies. This movie has all the wooden dialogue and clunky plot of a made-for-tv movie.
5,This is a life-long companion.,"I first bought this book in 1980 when I was on a sabbatical in New York. I had read about the demise of Dr. Tarnower in the newspapers and was just curious. I have adopted his recommendations and i keep track of my weight, dieting for 2 weeks once in a while, whenever my scales show 2kg more than my usual weight. This was easily done, notwithstanding the life style of a hospital medical doctor which I have led all those years. I am 69 years old now and this still works. I have bought this book as a present to many people who were interested in a life long program of keeping trim."
4,"Hard to believe, but it really does work!","If anyone is a skeptic of anything quick, easy and effortless when it comes down to losing weight, ""it's gotta be me"". This book, however, makes the two week plan a breeze to follow, offering options for four variations to the basic plan. I went on the traditional two week plan and lost exactly 20 pounds, as promised. The only thing I wish this book included was sample plans for the follow-up Keep Trim eating weeks. I felt safer when I was told exactly when and what to eat. I looked online and found a support group that was very helpful to chat and share ideas with, at (url). Reading the book is an important part of the process. I highly recommend that anyone interested in jump starting their metabolism and learning balanced nutrition and portion control should order this book."
4,This works if you are completely faithful to it.,"Tough to follow because of the small list of diet items for eating. it does have a few different diets so you can experiment. I lost 25 lbs. in 6 weeks. The food is easy to prepare. Requires complete shopping for different items. No sugar, no white flour."
1,Never Received Item waited for a month,"Never received item. Owner said it was sent through media mail which takes longer. Wanted this for an xmas gift ordered on Dec. 15th and still never received it as of today 1/15/12. Owner issued refund. I'm very upset that it was not sent through normal mail, I would have received it in 3 days especially since I paid for the postage. Still have no book!"
5,"""THE TERROR""-Boris Karloff, Jack Nicholson, Sandra Knight","Released in 1964, it was once said that horror films great Boris Karloff owed producer/director Roger Corman,time from the filming of a previous movie and Karloff payed Corman acting in ""The Terror"" co-starring the then young rookie actor Jack Nicholson as a stranded soldier in Napoleon's invading army in a coastal region of Germany. Co-starring in this thriller are Sandra Knight, Jonathan Haze, Dick Miller and other Corman's regulars. Definitely one of Corman's ""B"" movies, this film keeps you on the edge of your seat, its atmospheric and a gothic horror classic. This film is definitely on what I call the Roger Corman Hall of Fame, it belongs in the collection of every classic horror movie fan."
5,The most fun you can have with a book which isn't about sex!,"I was given an earlier printing of this book when I first learned to read, and I think it has something to do with my childhood nickname of ""Dictionary Breath."" It has remained among my most treasured possessions!While some of the words don't really seem to merit an entry in this book over its a delightful collection. There are some words such as ""grassation"" (to lie in wait to attack) which are so incredibly useful I don't know why they aren't in more common circulation.I would like to see the etymology included, but speculating about a word's etymology and then looking it up elsewhere has become part of the game for me and my friends."
4,You Get What You Pay For....,"This kit isn't anything great...but it's decent. The cymbal will bend on you pretty easily, but the snare is pretty good. Just be happy that you get something to play for this cheap, it's a really good deal."
5,A Record Of Greatness,"This is one of my favourite records in my collection right now, and it's been going nonstop in my disc-changer for the past six or seven months that I've had it. They are a cool band who got recognition for remixing Silverchair in the first place, and now have released an album similar to Junkie XL's work. It is fast, trancy, and would tear up any dancefloor in sight if given the chance. This is frest and exciting, and aside from Junkie XL, I can't compare this to anyone. Weird beats and simmering rythmns help to balance out the even stranger (kind of snotty) vocals here. My favourite tracks are ""Orange"", ""Useless Things"", ""Liquid"", ""Cynics"", and ""Set It Down"". Also, maybe buy the new MDFMK album."
1,words can barely describe...,"... how awful this band are and this album is, already just looking at this page has allowed that dumb piece of non-sensical tosh, aka Living On A Prayer, to filter into my mind and thoroughly depress me with its complete and utter blandness. i am ready to end it now, luckily i have an antidote, i hum ""I'm In the Mood for Dancing"" by the Nolans, yes i agree, complete rubbish, but even that's better than anything by bon jovi. buy this album just to burn it.. make a statement!"
4,Slippery Songs,"Slippery When Wet is the album that propelled Jon Bon Jovi and his bandmates from open act to major league headliners. Often they are dismissed as a 80's hair metal band, admittingly there is nothing on this album that will make you forget Springsteen or the Beatles, but it is unfair to lump them in with that genre. Although they had the look down (big hair, torn jeans etc.), unlike the other bands, they actually have a good ear for a melody and wrote good songs. Songs like the number one hits ""You Give Love A Bad Name"" & ""Livin' On A Prayer"" show their diversity. The former is a straight ahead rocker and the latter a moody number. ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" is a classic rock epic that aspires for greatness. Lesser known songs like ""I'd Die For You"", ""Social Disease"" & ""Raise Your Hands"" are solid songs. The lyrics sometimes fall into tired cliche terrority and the music is a little too slick in places, you have give the band an A for effort and genuiness. The album is just good fun."
5,One of my favorite albums!,"I love Slippery When Wet so much. It has a lot of great songs. I was blown away when I first listened to it at the start of this year. I'm only 15, I love the 80's and most kids my age don't listen to this kind of stuff but I think it's awesome! Bon Jovi is one of my favorite bands and I highly recommend this album. Rock on 80's music!"
5,Bon Jovi Slippery When Wet,"I had this on cassette and was replacing it for my collection. I received it in a timely manner and it was in great condition. I bought it used. I would recomment this dealer to anyone and of course, the CD to everyone that loves Bon Jovi, especially their original stuff. I loved this concert, I was 104 degrees and the band kept spraying us with water due to the heat. When they came on stage and everyone pushed forward, I was right up front. They asked people to move back so we wouldn't get squished. Excellent CD and Excellent concert!"
5,BON JOVI Slippery When Wet Album,This is my first CD of Bon Jovi music and it is great. The music is powerful and easy to sing along with. A great buy!! A+++++
2,Yikes!,"Obviously, this movie is not meant as a strict period piece. So, I sort of can deal with the rock music. I cannot, however, deal with the heroine Jocelyn. She is annoying at best. I have to agree with other reviewers, she doesn't fit at all in the movie. Maybe if they had changed her hair, her clothing, her mannerisms. Just change something. Kate was much more interesting and no where near as strange."
2,The 13th Century Clashes with the 21st Century...,"The film is a tale of three squires whose master dies prior to a joust that brings them their food and shelter. In order to to have food for the evening they decide that the youngest of them, whom has some talent, should joust and bring home a prize for food. This escalates and with the help of an unheard of writer they counterfeit family tree papers, which gives them the right to continue jousting and build wealth. Knight's Tale is neither drama, comedy, or satire, since it uses all of these aspects to sell humor, morals, and values. Unfortunately, the value of the story vanishes when these three genres conflict with each other making one laugh at the film rather than the parody in the film."
5,Not your Classic Medieval Managerie,"Excellent period reproduction with today's modern dialogue! The centrical serious moments are countered with hilarious banter of merry men on a journey of true life. This life is displayed in Love, Jealousy, Rage, Comradrie and most of all Honor. The gift of being anything you can imagine is portrayed beautifully. Watch and enjoy, for you to can change your stars if you'll only try."
4,We Will.. We Will Rock You,"To be honest, I had no desire to see this movie. I attended a rennisance festival in my area and it totally awakened me to this time in history and I thought hey, how bad could it be? Well I was astonished to find that it wasn't bad at all. I enjoyed it. It's a rather well told story and I don't think that the soundtrack takes from it at all. I thought this was a great movie over all. If you've ever been enchanted or interested in this time in history this will certainly give you a what if that was happening now feel."
3,"Fun movie, but not worth Blu-Ray","This movie has always amused me on DVD, so I figured I'd snag it on sale on Blu-Ray. Well, there is nothing diffrent from it's older DVD conterpart.No Hi-Def, enhancements or anything. So, unless you can find it cheaper on a sale someplace, just buy the DVD and save yourself some cash."
4,"SCFI-Funny, But WRONG","It was definitely a funny look at the medieval life of a Knight's Squires and their dreams of the living the Knight's life.The Jousting Terminates are compared to modern Football, Basketball, and Baseball games.The royal court balls dance to modern age music.This is a fun movie to watch and you will root for the hero.If children are watching this movie, they need to know that it fiction."
4,Please edit soundtrack.,Great movie. Can't wait. But why oh why did you put Shook me all night long when it should have been - WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!And the original version. This would have made the movie excellant.
4,Refreshing & Complete,"Anyone who trashes this movie either hasn't truly seen it, or suffers from lousy taste and a non-existent sense of humor. I admit the previews made it look like some ill-conceived cliche. But when my wife rented the DVD, I was surprised to find a storyline that's incredibly creative with no holes. It also features some sensational acting (the Chaucer character and Rufus Sewell in particular).FYI, this isn't Shakespeare; if you got a bang out of watching Raymond Burr in Othello, it's not for you. However, A Knight's Tale is far from the predictable action pulp we usually get. This is one of the funnest most enjoyable movies I've seen in past years. Give it a chance."
4,Great!,"This movie was a great blend of medevil and 20th century. I thought the music went great with the theme of the movie. I recommend this to anyone who has an open mind about movies. Those people who don't like mixing times shouldn't see it, but I still think it's great!!"
4,I really liked this movie...,"Strange as it may seem, I've watched this movie a couple of dozen times and seem to enjoy it each time. I also pick up on additional pieces of the plot that I missed the time before. Heath Ledger does an excellent job of getting you to root for him through out the movie and feel his pain during his challenging times. One to add to the library."
1,Dumb and Dumber,"Dumb, dumb, dumb, ney, moronic. If you want Medieval fantasy with silly music, rent Ladyhawk. A much better film."
1,This movie bites,"I saw this movie in the theatres when it came out. I should have spent the money on something better. It was trite and ridiculous. The opening scene, where the peasants are clapping along to ""We Will Rock You""...I should have walked out then. It was overhyped and unoriginal in the extreme. Even if you like certain types of stupid movies you may find this one hard to swallow. I certainly did. It's two hours of my life I'd love to have back."
3,"Great movie, I expected more extras though..","Pros:Great SoundGreat ImageGreat Movie in generalCons:Languages as it sounds great only in English, and does not have Spanish.Extras as the menu is very very simple, we just have the option to change the subs, language, and select the scene.The box where it came is very simple, no art-book or something.If you do not want to watch it in Spanish, if you are not looking for extras on the movie, and you just want to get a great movie, %100 recommended."
2,Disappointing,"I discovered Rory Block one night on Austin City Limits. I was captivated. On stage by herself, performing passionate folk/blues, singing and playing her acoustic guitar as if she meant every word and note. Bonnie Raitt, Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez all rolled into one. I went on a quest to find some of her CDs, and eventually bought Mama's Blues, which I liked. I also recently bought Confessions of a Blues Singer, which is even better.Tornado disappointed me. Only three or four of the songs were the bluesy stuff I was expecting. Most of the rest are more mainstream ballady things, and they really drag. I really love the artist, but this was one CD I wished I hadn't bought."
2,"Ambitious, beautiful and stylized junk!","Five beautiful friends who start receiving threatening valentines find themselves being hunted by a repressed killer (obviously inspired [or stolen] from HALLOWEEN) wearing a cupid mask. Is it that nerd they all teased in sixth grade? Attractive but predictable, poorly written thriller that not only has a complete lack of suspense but can't make us seem to care about a character of any kind. Still, at least director Blanks tries. Based on the novel by Tom Savage."
1,it's horrible all right,"Valentine is a ghastly mess. Upon recieving violent valentines the ""heroines"" proceed to go out alone, ignore the advice of the police, withold evidence and generally act like fools. The plot had potential but the actors and the crummy dialog destroy all hope. David Boreanz essentially plays Angel as a drunkard human instead of a brooding vampire but that's the best thing I can say about the flick. Denise Richardson is the worst thing about it. Her acting was never her strongest suit but in Valentine it takes a real nose dive. ...The twist ending didn't make a lick of sense and I took the DVD back to the store and begged to exchange with something else."
2,"Average teen slasher pic, but still pretty good...","While there has indeed been a long line of teen slasher movies, they have tended, over the years (with the notable exception of some good scares in the Scream series) to be predictable and formulaic. Well, Valentine is no different; however, I do have to give better than average marks to the acting in this one, and the deaths in this film are perhaps a bit more creative and interesting than in the usual movie of this genre. The storyline does indeed keep you guessing until the end, which is rare these days. This one won't be on anyone's Top 20 horror films list, but it is fun, watchable, and worth a rental.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
1,Not what u thought it would be,this movie really isn't as good as I thought it would be. I only wanted to see it because I am a big fan of Katherine Hegil but shhe ws in the began of the movie for like only 7 or atlest 10 minutes. After that it really wasn't scary as it sounds. The BIZAR part of the moive was in the end. Go seee it for yourself but for Katherine Hegil the and atleast stay awake for the half of it.
2,A strange little film,"Something like an episode of ""Sex and the City"" directed by Wes Craven, this mercifully short teen flick can't decide if it's a girl-power sex farce or a by-the-numbers thriller. It hedges its bets and settles for being plain bad. It might have worked if pre-release buzz hadn't identified the serial killer. But if you know who it is, the whole thing's rather tedious. Denise Richards does her usual thing, as does David Boreanaz with one pleasant exception - unlike in ""Angel"", he's occasionally allowed to smile."
3,A decent movie,Starts of with some hot girls getting demented valentine cards. then one by one they start dieing off and so do there boyfriends. a little like i know what you did last summer but its good none the less. not really any scares but good enough.
2,IT'S ALL PRETTY MUCH BEEN DONE BEFORE.,"THE ACTING, THE WRITING, AND THE DIRECTING ARE ALL LESS THAN AVERAGE. THE PLOT IS A BUNCH OF RECYCLED IDEAS THROWN TOGETHER. I'M GIVING IT TWO STARS BECAUSE: 1)THERE ARE SOME FUNNY MOMENTS IN THE MOVIE AND 2)THE ENDING IS VERY GOOD. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BE SCARED OUT OF YOUR SEATS, HOWEVER, ""VALENTINE"" IS NOT THE MOVIE YOU WANT TO SEE."
3,"""Sream"" on valentines day!","This movie reminds me of the scream trilogy. Some outkast from someones past wanting revenge for this time something about what looks like a broken heart? I guess thats where the whole valentines thing comes in. The killer uses this holiday to stalk those who he believes denied him a fair shot on valentines day or should i say valentines days in the past. Thats what i gathered from it all but each person has to judge it for themselves and figure it out on their own i guess. If you liked the scream trilogy like i did, and enjoy friday the 13th movies then i would suggest this movie."
5,From Mediocre to Magnificent!,A great guide for anyone who wants to know how to make a difference in whatever they do to create personal success and influence and be happy at the same time!
2,HUH>?,"I rented this game expecting some fast and furious gameplay, the truth is, is that thats all you get. No statistics or roster changes!!!! Thats a major blow, besides that it has dumb gimics like when you have to play against a team of dolphins... WHY??? I recommend renting it first, the graphics are the only good thing about it, all you do is play play play, it gets pretty redundant and boring after a while, with no stats or rosters to look at."
1,Repetitive and dull,"If you play one level, you've played them all. The cities look almost alike, and you do the same thing every time. They have thrown in a few bonus levels, but they still don't make the game any better. I was excited by seeing new characters and all, but after playing it once I never wanted to play it again. The original was more fun."
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge Archer fan, and have read most of his works. Kane & Abel was very nice, but this second installment of the series was several notches below. Almost 50% of the book is a recap of the first book (though things are narrated from Florentyna's views, but a rehash nonetheless). The second half of the book is too procedural, in the sense that anyone not knowing the American election system will be absolutely lost and bored. The second half is a little too descriptive of the electoral processes, and even otherwise there is really nothing much to the plot. Planning to now read 'Shall we tell the President'..... hope that turns out to the usual Archer affair."
3,disappointed,"I just loved Kane and Abel, but felt that much of Prodigal Daughter was a rehash. The other thing I didn't like about Prodigal Daughter was that everything always seemed too perfect. Otherwise, I love Jeffrey Archer and this was an acceptable read."
1,Disappointing,"Loved Kane & Abel & was looking forward to reading the sequel. I understand that in a sequel you briefly recap some of the history that happened in the book before but I found the first half of this book, except for a few added details was basically a recap of Kane & Abel - in fact the one chapter was word for word what happened in Kane & Able. It was kind of like re-watching a movie you had already seen. I found myself wanting to skip pages till I got to a part where I did not already know what was going to happen. The second half of the book was mostly politics which I know interests a lot of people but personally for me was incredibly boring.....I should have stopped at Kane & Able"
3,let down,After reading Cane & Able this book just wasn't as good. There was so much repeating what happened in the first book that I knew just what was going to happen so eventually gave up and went on to read something else.
5,And Daughters too.,"The life of Florentyna Rosenofski is well read out in the sequel to Kane & Able.Life is good for this young heiress, privilage, a nanny, loving mother, college etc..., untill she is propositioned by an attractive man at Bloomingdales, where she works behind the counter, who keeps asking for gloves.Her relationship with her loving but overbearing father turns upside down when she reveals to him that her lover is Richard Kane, son of his most hated enemy.Suddenly out in the real world with the love of close college friends and mother, ""Jessie"" and Richard strike out on their own.Florentyna soon finds out her real calling is politics and she soon starts off down the road that will see her obtain the highest office in the land, albeit with tragedy and a few revelations along the way."
2,Author can do better,I didn't realize this book was a sequel to one I had read 20 years ago. It could have been better written.
2,Disappointing,"After reading ""Not a penny more, not a penny less"", I was expecting a witty and sharp piece of work. Not so this time. Girl meets world, girls wants it, girl overcomes all kinds of obstacles, girl gets world. Yawn. ""Not a penny more..."" is a FANTASTIC book, if you've never read Archer before, start with that one. And pass on ""The Prodigal Daughter""."
4,Good sampler of EWF; not the best single CD collection,"This CD offers a lot of their famous hits and is a good sampler. However, it is not complete enough (hence Vol. 1) because it does not contain great songs/hits like ""Saturday Nite"" (1976), ""Boogie Wonderland"" (1979), and ""Let's Groove"" (1981). All of these songs are included in the single CD collection Earth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits, which is a much more complete collection on 1 CD (plus, it has remastered sound). I would highly recommend that collection over this one, especially for casual fans like myself."
4,Funny movie,I know this didn't make it at the movies but it has its moments enough to make me laugh. Plus I couldn't beat the price for it.
3,So much potential,"This movie did not play out as I expected. You expect the men to go wild, getting with all kinds of women and go to strip clubs, but they surprise you. It would have been a funnier movie if they did what you expect."
2,"The idea is good, but not the movie","The idea of getting a 'Hall Pass' from marriage sounds great, who would not like that? After watching the movie my wife told me 'absolutely not!', there you have it.There were few parts that were funny, but I would not consider this movie a comedy. Maybe it was the script that was bad. It really is not a family movie to watch with children.For those of you who have idealistic opinions about marriage with children, you should see this movie to see how it is like in real life. Yes, men will do all of those things portrayed in this movie (perhaps women too, I wouldn't know), except the crass conversations."
2,Could have been funny,"Love the actors, but the acting (probably because of the script) was horrible! The babysitter did the best acting job - seriously. Some say it makes the men look like idiots, and somehow the women 'win' in the end. Honestly, I'd have to believe someone in this movie was real before feeling offended. There is gross out toilet humor , a couple of boobs, and what I think to be (but who knows) a fake male body part. If you're of age, and that sounds good to you, save yourself some money and just rent it. Obviously not for kids."
2,You should get a hall pass so you don't have to sit through this unfunny movie!,I basically agree with marcus t brody. He had the most helpful review. The trailer looked awesome. the barista girl was extremely hot. They should paint her and hang her up in a art museum. The movie was a huge let down and didn't really fit the plot description it was a lot of dead air and i don't think i laughed once! Owen wilson definitely took a step back in his career with this film and i love the guy! Don't ever pay to watch this film. For the people who watched this film there are more people saying this movie sucks and the ones who say it's funny probably had a lot of alcohol before watching it!
2,pits,"couple funny parts but for how good the idea was the movie just doesn't deliver. It's like the film can't decide if it's serious and heartfelt or just trying to be over the top funny. Ends up being neither, Ending is dumb, some of the most repeated jokes aren't even funny."
3,The Gun Digest Book of Firearms Assembly/Disassembly,"This reference book contained the information I was looking for and will be a book that I can rely on for many years. The only problem I found was that some pages were almost to dark to see breakdown components. A better breakdown sequence would be helpful. All in all the book was helpful and I was able to realize the problem I was having in reassembling a Winchester Automatic 12ga, shotgun."
3,Only for fans of Sigourney (or Oprah),"I've been a Sigourney Weaver fan for about 20 years now without ever being convinced that she's much of an actor. I've decided that she's a female Harrison Ford - authoritative in heroic roles calling for steely resolve and clumsy at everything else, particularly romance and comedy.""Map of the World"" is a fine showcase for her flinty screen persona and astoundingly well-preserved bod (showing full frontal at age 50 must be a Hollywood record) but it can't transcend its soggy Oprah-fied storyline."
4,Movie,This was a movie I partially saw on tv & just had to get it. It was very good. Have told several people about it
1,Not again!,We bought this as a replacement for one that came with our 2002 RV. The original had never been used until recently when we found that it leaks when the valve is off. The new one appears to be the same manufacturer and even leaks the same way! Too bad since we've had a hard time finding a lightweight and compact sprayer with an on/off valve.
1,BRING BACK STONE!!!!!!! or HOLLY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Stuart Woods is one of my favorite authors but boy was I disappointed in his latest book. I wanted to stop reading it from the get-go but because this was Stuart Woods, I knew it would pick up. NOT! I love the Stone and Holly books, even the Will novel. Why would he stray from success? SW: You have enough characters and so many directions to take them -- bring them back please!"
3,Uneven,"I'm a big Woods fan but this was ultimately disappointing. It starts out great, driving story line, painting a picture of hollywood in the '30's that is thrilling. But he gets bogged down in the middle with too much WWII and the ending is non-existent. Yet, I'm hooked on Woods and look forward to his next one."
2,Not one of Stuart Woods' Best Efforts,"I usually buy Stuart Woods books as soon as they come out, but somehow this one I missed. I got it recently when a bookstore had a buy 3 get one free sale. I'm glad I didn't actually spend any money on it. It's a fairly 'ho-hum' story, where the action just never seems to pick up. The ending of the book was also a big disappointment for me. I think there was so much more potential in the story, but Woods' just wasn't up to some of his better efforts. One of my personal favorites still is Imperfect Strangers. Some of his more recent books just haven't had the same level of suspense."
5,A darn good read!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I will be looking into any other works by Mr. Woods. Thank you!
2,Minces more than it chops,I don't love this. It minces onions more than chops. I should have sent it back but didn't want to package it up and mail it.
2,Blade keeps popping up,"The blade tends to pop up and disengage from the motor shaft. It's really a design problem; I've had an old B&D; mini chopper and a new cheapo brand chopper and neither have this problem. One easy fix is to insert a screw into the top center of the plastic blade post, so that it is flush with the cover, to keep the blade anchored down.The button also became very hard to push after a year or so. In short, they don't make 'em like they used to!"
3,Black & Decker HC306 1-1/2-Cup One-Touch Electric Chopper,"I enjoy having a smaller chopper to use. The only negative thing I can say about this one is, it needs just another inch or 1 1/2 inches on the container. I looked for one a little bit larger like the last one I had that was misplace during moving but was unable to find one. Other than this one bit, I have been very happy with the One-Touch Electric Chopper."
1,Small and difficult to use,The size is way to small to actually help with chopping anything. An onion has to be cut into 8 to 10 small pieces and can be chopped in 2 to 3 roundsAlso getting the jar aligned to start the chopper is a task in itself. Getting the jar out is another painful task/it's made life more difficult instead of helping with the choppingI had an old model some years ago and I really miss that
2,poor performance,I wanted this to chop nuts and grains. It can barely chop almonds. I have a tiny one cup herb grinder that is even better. Don't bother buying this unless cucumbers are the only thing you need to chop!
2,Hard to get to turn on.,I cannot seem get the dots and lid to line it up properly to make it start. Poorly designed. Would not order again.
2,Effective Until it Breaks,"I totally love this little chopper. Two have broken on me now, though. The plastic that flips it into place jammed both times. I won't be a sucker for a third time."
1,Probably my worst purchase,"This item was of absolutely no use when it comes to cutting/chopping vegetables. The container is small, cleaning is difficult. The blades just cut the vegetables so fine that it turns to gravy. Also, to use this one has to cut the vegetables into smaller pieces anyways, so it is better to spend 10 more seconds and cut them further. (I am a student and thought this would help me quicken the process - but the answer is a resounding NO.)This product does not deserve the praise it got from others. Definitely do not recommend this to anyone."
1,What a piece of junk!,"After using twice, it was no longer possible to remove the blade shaft, and therefore not possible to remove the bowl to wash it. I have spent hours on hold on the phone trying to get Black and Decker on the phone to complain. Don't waste your time and money on this item."
4,Infrequent Chopper,"I don't cook much but when I do, I hate having to chop everything and this little guy is a big help in the kitchen."
3,Low Quality,"Have owned 4 of these choppers in the past 15-years and every time I get a new one, the quality is less. I will definitely find another brand to buy when this one ""kicks the dust"""
4,A chopping purchase made me happy,"Don't be fooled by its size. Its a small chopper but works grand. I was skeptical at first, right after placing 11/2 onions and 5 heads of garlic, 5 branches celery, one whole tomato, 2 branches thyme, 1/2 bell pepper, and 4 seasoning peppers,it chopped like a pro. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of its size. All in all a very good purchase"
2,Save Your Money,"Bought this chopped after having had wonderful experiences with 2 of the original B&D 2-speed chopper. The 2 speed chopper is a kitchen must have, but it's not longer produced. The new single speed replacement is disappointing. Going from 2 speeds to 1 forces you to pulse to control the chop size (to avoid juicing the item), the bowl is VERY difficult to remove, the instructions do not note that there is a trick (squeeze & turn) to remove the bowl. This is a problem if your hands are damp or you don't have major hand strength. Got rid of the new unit, pulled out the old one and will continue to hand sharpen the blade and pray the motor holds up. Sadly no replacement blades are available for my wonderful little chopped. Save your money and time and passt on this unit."
4,Perfect for one person!,I live alone and needed a food processor. This is the perfect ssize for one person and gets the job done. Great price for a great appliance.
5,Great,"I work at a fire dept, so as we are known for I am always cooking. This makes cutting vegetables so easy. Within seconds you can have them cut. I can't believe I didn't buy one of these sooner."
3,Warranty issue,Box states that there is a two year warranty on this item but company states it is a one year warranty. No information on what is covered on box or in instruction sheet. Company does not answer so be cautious about purchasing from any retailer that will not stand behind product. Manufacturer obviously DOES NOT and does not abide by Warranty Laws either. Sure looks like a Bait and Switch issue as well. Not real typical of Amazon to sell stuff under these circumstances.
3,I've only used it once,"Well I haven't had the chance to dice up much of anything yet. But when I diced up a bell pepper um it seemed a little mushy, I expected a nice fine dice. But maybe I haven't given it much of a chance. So I won't leave anything negative about it."
2,Shopping complaints,"Good evening the following email is to notify the order Placed Order:March 30, 2011View Order Details | View InvoiceOrder Number: 103-2091903-7689000Recipient: Naileth Alcala Alejandra RamosOne of the electrical equipment wine contains errors and is as follows:Black & Decker HC306 One-Touch 1-1/2-Cup Electric ChopperSold by: Amazon.com, LLCIt is convenient to check the same in store and on receipt of the order is impossible to return it."
3,"Unlike Mulholland Drive, this one keeps the line of thought.","Liked it. Didn't love it. Liked it. Worth watching? Yes. Worth buying? Perhaps? Does it make me think? Yes. John Goodmen's best acting job ever? Yes. Captivating? Absolutely.Now, those question having been answered, I'd like to let you in on something - this film is not for everyone. It will keep everyone on the edge of their, waiting for the next squence to hint something at us. Well, we get plenty of hints, but when it's all said and done, we are basically left to decide what this film meant.Category person A: Will not like how this film ended and will utterly be left puzzled.Category person B: Will figure it all out and love it.Category person C: (the one I'm in) Will want to watch it again, this time with a prepared mind.This is a solid film and one that will certainly make everyone think.Score by Carter Burwell is solid as well."
5,Tweaked 'til it screams...,"The genius of The Brothers Coen lies in their ability to examine American Culture and tweak it until it screams in transcendent agony. This fine film is no exception. Picture John Turturro, John Goodman, Judy Davis & Steve Buscemi... Now throw in surreal camera-craft, blast them with the contrast of bright Hollywood sunlight and the stillness of deep shadow, and you begin to get the idea.It's set in Hollywood circa the raid on Pearl Harbor. A young and somewhat successful playwright from New York attempts to cope with the coke-, booze- & benny-fueled craziness of the early-40's studio scene. Enter J. Goodman's character: a bona fide psycho, and watch the 'puzzi' get extra fancy."
5,Great follow-up to Miller's Crossing,"Miller's Crossing made me think that the Coens may be the greatest active moviemakers America had to offer. Barton Fink did a lot to confirm that. It's beautiful to look at, and fun to watch, with outstanding performances from the entire cast. John Turturro and John Goodman are both amazing in this. The dialogue is fantastic, although not as wonderfully lyrical as in Miller's Crossing.As with Miller's Crossing, I was hoping for an all-out, deluxe, special edition once this came to DVD. While the extras are nice, I wanted more. Still, the movie looks great, and it's wonderful to finally own it in widescreen."
2,Could Have Been Better,"The acting was alright, but i read the book and while the movie remained true to the text it did not give any reason as to why Athena's husband was after her. Its these kinds of details that hurt the movie. It also was a little averdramatized."
3,VHS vs. TV Version,"The intimate knowledge of the characters and the Mafia lifestyle is superb and the storyline could not work better, but if you are a k.d. lang devotee and saw it on TV you will be extremely disappointed because some scenes have been cut...specifically the one with k.d. and another female at a party or the cast closing party going to dance together. If anything, I expected the VHS to contain more than the TV showing. The cut(s) were very disappointing."
3,Cute Shoe! Not to practical for school,"My 6 yr old daughter loves these shoes! we got the black and fushsia, & although very pretty to look at, not to practical for school! the front of her shoes have become pretty tattered with the sequins falling off. She is pretty active, but still wants to be girlie, so I thought these would be perfect with the sneaker type sole! And they are, except for the diminishing sequins pieces! More for pictures or dressier affairs!"
3,Polar Explorations 101,"If you are looking for an introduction/overview text on polar explorations, Maxtone-Graham's book is your ticket. I have always gotten the explorers confused. So,I found it a very helpful book. Like the other reviewers, I, too, was struck by the author's not including Shackleton's adventures in Anartica, probably the best story of them all.Dress warmly while reading."
3,"This game had potential, but could have been better.","Spyhunter is a pretty interesting game. The first level is a track that you go on to learn how to do different things, like shoot targets, dodge civilians, put GPS trackers on boats and much more. The game is pretty fun, and the graphics aren't bad. I like the fact that in this game you can drive on land or in the water and bust through walls and other fun things. The game takes you to many interesting levels such as Venice, which I thought was very well done with gondolas driving around the canals and little cafes in the streets. There are not many missions in the game so I can see how many people say it gets old, and the graphics aren't that amazing, so its not the greatest game. Hopefully if they make another one, it will be better. I reccomend to anyone that thinks this game is cool, to rent it and play it for awhile to see how you like it, and then decide whether or not to buy it."
2,"Ok, Nicholson can act! Great news...","We all know Nicholson can act. And tha''s the only thing worthwhile in this movie: to watch him interpret in a great and convincing manner a retired cop haunted by a Pledge to solve the murder of a little girl. But that's all you will get from this movie, fellow.Penn's direction is slow, uninspiring. No, I'm not just another fast-food film consumer. But it was clear for me that Penn tried to design a special mood for the film, but id not work. The cast is also misleading to potential audience: we've got the names of Del Toro and Rourke: they appear briefly, no more than four minutes, probably paying some kind of favor to Penn.It was not a total waste of time, but it came close. MOvies like Charlie's Angels are a TOTAL waste of time because they're total junk; movies like this one comes close because they heroically try to be bigger than they really are, and it does not always work."
2,Why?,"Recently director Penn lamented the gun culture of contemporary cinema. Seeing as 'The Pledge' is arguably a horror film, albeit the horror slowly dawning on the audience from an unexpected source, isn't the picture merely one big gun pointed at the audience's head? I really don't know what attracted him to the frankly emetic story line, but this isn't necessarily less pernicious than a lot of other Hollywood product, especially that uncalled for moment in the church."
3,Time Passerby,The movies ending was not what I anticipated.A couple of scenes had suspense built inconsistenly.The movie is good enough if you need time to pass.
1,I think this movie was bad and boring!,"I'm not too sure why people gave this movie good reviews or any stars. I mean, I'm not trying to be a jerk or anything...I respect Jack Nicholson as an actor, but this movie was cut bad or something. Maybe it just went over my head! The movie seems to be leading up to something and...nothing, it ends! I don't write any reviews on here, this movie was just bad enough to make me do so."
4,Brutal Honesty and Technical Perfection,"I purchased this DVD solely for its purportedly near-perfect picture quality and I was not disappointed. The skin tones are remarkably even and realistic, the clarity and detail are astounding and the black levels are deep.As for the film it self, I found it pessimistic, grim, uncomfortable and above all else, entrancing. The acting and plot are both laden with subtleties and emotional depth that, if given the chance, will leave you deeply affected.So, with all of this praise, why a 4-Star rating? Well, you will just have to watch the film in its entirety and come to share in my frustration of how unfair life can be.Highly recommended for both its artistic and technical merits."
2,unacomplished,"I am one of the most avid collector's of Jack Nicholson's work. I have to date all but 2 films he has EVER done. I was completely and utterly dissapointed in the lack of continuity and direction. 1995's Crossing Guard was a far superior collaboration between Penn and Nicholson. The Pledge drags throughout..is much to vague in its point and manages to accomplish nothing. Nicholson's performance is solid, if not off kilter. Even the emotional struggle within the character was much more defined in The crossing guard. overall I was very dissapointed in this movie I had impatiently waited for. But of course I'll have to buy the DVD simply for the collection =)"
1,Amazed,"Imagine my surprise; after sitting through a two+ hour movie, paying rapt attention to what might be clues that lead to what is sure to be an exciting ending, I am not only SORELY disappointed by a hideously poor wrap-up, [....]I don't even know where to start in terms of this film. There are SO MANY loose ends, so many details focused on over and over that ultimately lead nowhere, story lines begun that are never followed through on (including the title ""pledge""). I am all for endings that leave something to the viewer's imagination - but I really got the sense that the cast and crew just got bored, chucked the script and called it quits.Overall - in spite of moments of impressive acting and cinematography - extremely disappointing.And that, my intelligent and unintelligent friends alike - is my OPINION!"
2,A waste of 2 hours of my life,"I can understand how this was much more than a simple crime-story movie. It just dragged for such a long time, and I felt too much was never explained. My husband and I thought the killer was two different people, and much to my disappointment, we will never know. Was it the priest? The faceless man from the Christmas store? The snow plow guy? A woman? The movie just ends. I can look back now and see a few things that make this more artistic, but I still feel strongly that I was mis-lead about what the film was about, and was robbed by the ending, or lack thereof. I loved Memento, and thought that was a fascinating and incredible movie, so I'm not only into flashy Hollywood films. But this movie I thought was a waste of time. And if someone knows who the killer is, please let me know."
2,shoot the screenwriter!,"As several reviewers have rightly pointed out, the movie starts out with promise but completely fails to deliver any resolution. The screenwriter was apparently unable to figure out a satisfactory climax to the story, and simply gave up. What a shame -- the acting is fine, and the story generates plenty of dramatic tension, but then the movie just fizzles out.This was one of the most disappointing films of 2000."
2,"If it was an orginal idea, my rating might be higher...","This is a very brooding, slow remake of the 1994 movie ""The Cold Light of Day"". Although I liked the original film quite a bit, this one was too slow and the ending stank.This version had Jack Nicholson playing a retired detective tracking a child-murderer. The acting was good and I was interested half-way through the film until I realized that this was an almost carbon-copy of the 1994 film.I had a real problem with the ending too. I think it was a mistake and made the whole exercise really pointless. Not to give anything away but to me, it would make more sense if Nicholson's character had to really deal with consequences of his actions with his newly found family.This movie is not really that bad, it just could have been better. A lot better..."
2,Don't waste your time...,"I enjoy Jack Nickolson. There is a great message in the movie about ""strangers"" and kidnapping-even in a small town. However, I think the movie was too long and too drawn out. Nickolson's character was suffering from paranoia about the little girl being kidnapped and killed. He made a promise to one of the girl's mother to get to the bottom of it and not to quit until they find the person that killed her little girl. He keeps (or at least tries to) his promise and even though he was now retired, he still continued to search for the person that killed the little girl...paranoid and all. Not worth my time. I don't recommend the movie, to long, to predicting. You're leave the movie with NO sense of closure, just like Nickolson's character. Pass on it."
1,"Very, Very Disapointing!! Great talent but a terrible movie.",Considering the talent this is a very disjointed movie. Benicio Del Toro is only on for five minutes. The same for Helen Mirren.The great Jack Nicholson is wasted. This is NOT a happy ending movie. Sean Penn has a very disapointing directing style. It is slow and disjointed. My wife liked it.(there is no accounting for taste!) In my opinion this is NOT a TWO hour popcorn movie.
1,What a stinker!,"How could such a star-powered cast have ever agreed to act in this bomb? Did they even read the script? And what was Sean Penn thinking? How many nature shots do we have to have to substitute for plot developments? What heavy-handed directing, particularly the storm clouds gathering! Duh. The camera, as always, loves Nicholson but that does not make up for a real bad script and a really bad job of directing. I don't know how many times I looked at my watch, anxious for the ending, which, in itself, was a flop as well."
1,Not good (or has that review title been used here already?),"Other reviewers have noted the brevity of several great actors' scenes, but Mr. Del Toro's scene at the jail was at least twice as long as it should have been.There was some fairly good work here by some excellent actors--which was outweighed by ridiculous camerawork and editing. The attempts at surrealism were more often tedious and annoying. There were just too many such ""Oliver Stone Moments"", which gave me the impression that the main focus of the directing was on gimmickry--rather than on story-telling.Speaking of the story, that was a bit weak, too. Why did the film end the way it did? I could see no logic or cause/effect relationship between the events in the final scenes.What motivated the detective to run to the child's mother? Either he thought there was danger, or he didn't.Wierd, and disturbing? Yes. Thought-provoking? Yes.It provoked the thought, ""Why have I wasted my time and money?"""
5,Perfect way to get in the spirit of Christmas,This is a wonderful story about a little girl that learns that it truly is better to give than to receive :-) Such a delight!
4,WOW! Interesting style of hip-hop,"Destiny's Child is the best girl groups since, well The supremes. I mean they are all very pretty, they can sing like nobodies business, and they are famous already. The only bad thing I think about them is that like almost all girl groups, they diss all men in their music. Not all people are cheaters and players and jerks. But I guess I have to deal with the fact that that is the way that all of them do their thing. I really like this cd, and it expresses all of their thoughts in the songs all over track. Way to go DC, keep it goin'!:)"
3,A great way to end the decade............,"With the recent solo sucesses of all the members of Destiny's Child, it's not hard to forget where it all came from. There most recent album, Survivor, is a bunch of good songs wrapped around filler, but their second album, The Writing's On The Wall, is much more cohesive and listenable. I will go as far as to say that it's one of the top 10 R&B albums of the 90's. My only problem is one that many have already pointed out; that Beyonce gets more of the spotlight than the other three members, which ultimately led to the dissolution of the original DC lineup."
5,Just peachy.,"Out of my 30 some C.D.'s, this is my favorite. I got this C.D. is July of '99, and right from the beginning I loved it. The reason I like it so much is because unlike most C.D.'s there is a lot of cool songs instead of just one or two. I would suggest this to any r&b lover."
5,IT'S THE BEST!!!!,"THEY HAVE DONE IT AGAIN AND I LOOOOOVVE THIS CD AND ESPECIALLY""BUG A BOO"" IT IS THE COOLEST CD AND THEY ARE THE MOST PRETTIEST GIRLS EVER. THEY ARE MY FASHION MODELS AND I WOULD LOVE TO LOOK LIKE ANY OF THESE GIRLS--WE BLACK GIRLS RULE!!!!!!!!! AND IF ANYONE HAS A PROBLEM WITH IT WELL BACK OFF AND LEAVE THE BLACK LADIES TO SPEAK OUT!!!!"
2,mediocre album,"if you are into dancing, clubs, partying, etcthis album is for youif you are into old school r and b this is not for youbecause these lyrics and tunes have been played before in different variations so its kind of oldthis is for the new generation who has never heard the old songs."
5,Great CD,"I thought this CD was great. It met my standards of great music. The songs were excellent, upbeat, great to dance to. The gospel medley was really cool, and showcased their talent even more. Overall, this was an excellent CD."
4,Nice album,"My favorite songs are:ConfessionsTemptationIf You LeaveShe Can't Love YouStayI guess all the songs that didn't play out on the radio. Don't get me wrong, they were nice songs when they came out, but when I pop the CD in, I skip them."
2,Scratched.,The music content on this CD is wonderful. The actual product was a disappointment. The CD was extremely scratched and I was unable to listen to most of the tracks. There was no point in selling this product.
5,oh my god!,oh my god! this is the best cd and the best group. I luv destiny's child! i'm going out tomorrow to get the cd! I luv it! I'm so excited! Everyone- trust me. BUY THE CD!
3,Missing Information,"As a whole the movie was informative. But some very important information was left out. The press conference film right after Kennedy was killed was not in the movie. This press conference had the speaker talking about and showing the ENTRY wound to the right temple area of the head. They also left out the bullet holes that past from the front through the wind shield and the bullet dent to the frame of the wind shield also from the front. There are a lot more questions that went unanswered or were left out most likely because of the time constraints. But like I said before, all and all the movie was informative."
5,JFK,I got this for my father's bday. He loved it! He went to the JFK Museum awhile back and got really interested in the subject.
1,How many more JFKs to come?,"I understand that when DVDs first came out we wantedd to get all of our favorites ASAP - Right Stuff, JFK, Total Recall, etc. I name these three because they were all released and then re-released with new stuff. The new stuff was cool, and it came much later than when the DVD was originally released. However, this is the third JFK DVD to be released already. How many more should we expect. What makes this one anymore special than the Director's Cut. I appreciate trying to get as much stuff on the DVD as you can, but why could it not have been done on the second one. These DVDs are becoming like computers, as soon as you buy on you better beware because a new, sleeker model will soon be on the way.It boggles my mind!!!"
5,JFK Blu-ray,"Amazon is the best place online to buy. Everything comes on time (or earlier), and is just as promised. I bought about %80 of my Christmas list at Amazon. They have a wonderful selection, and I had to return an item (my son and I bought the same thing) and it was easier than going to the store and standing in line. I just mailed it back (at Amazon's expense) and my account was credited in 3 days. I will continue to buy at Amazon."
2,Boring and nothing new,"Except for some fine performances, this examination into the Kennedy Assassination really doesn't tell us anything new or different. It's hard to be entertained or informed by a movie that simply presents the facts everyone has heard a hundred times. Not even good as a documentary because it's been Hollywoodized. If you like Oliver Stone, watch ""Platoon"" instead because it's a much better film."
1,"Hesperus Press Kindle Edition Is NOT ""The Tragedy of Korosko""","[This review notes a problem with the Hesperus Press Kindle edition. It is not a review of the book itself.]Hesperus Press offers the most expensive Kindle edition of ""The Tragedy of Korosko"". Unfortunately, the work delivered is ""Through the Magic Door"", a long essay in which Conan Doyle ruminates about his favorite writers. The substitution is surely inadvertent. A review seemed like the best way to call it to the publisher's attention and in the meantime warn prospective buyers."
1,"propaganda music,for research interest only.","Music on this album are purely communist propanganda music from Red China. It's important if you are into this research topic.But as a whole,this album is lack of creativity ."
4,This is our History,"I bought ""Primitive Hearths in the Pyrenées"" because I was born and live in the area studied by this book and because Paul Vaillant Couturier , Ida Treat husband , was raised in my village.The places and people described in it are familiar to me and it was then an opportunity to me to have an insight in their way of life in the twenties. I also know the different caves referred to in this book.I came across it by accident as an acquaintance of mine who was also raised in the village of Sainte-Croix Volvestre (Ariège / France) and is finishing a biography of Paul Vaillant Couturier had also bought it a few weeks before."
4,Everything you need to know about Zorro,"This is the definitive book about the history of Zorro. It goes into detail about the masked hero from his humble pulp fiction beginning in 1919 to the present day new retelling in ""The Mask of Zorro."" It also delves into the background of all the actors behind the mask. The author really has the inside track on the charactor, being married to John Getz, co-owner of Zorro Productions! A must read for any fan of the ""Fox""."
5,I'm not a big poetry reader but I like this book.,"I want to read poetry, I really do. But something about me--poor memory, poor ear, poor intellect--makes the poetry-reading experience a slog. I don't typically read poetry because I actually enjoy it, I read it because I feel I should enjoy it.Even so, there are a few poets that I really do connect with and enjoy and Edwin Arlington Robinson is one. I've enjoyed most of the poems in this volume and return to it periodically. Highly recommended for the everyman."
2,Difficult to Follow,"At first glance this book seems almost as simple as paint-by-number, but when trying to do the projects I found that the explanations were sketchy and the photographs didn't show every step. I'm not an absolute beginner with pastels but my attempts certainly didn't get anywhere near the projects shown, and I don't feel as thought I learned anything. It's nice to see what's possible, but it would be better to work with simpler projects that are explained in detail. I definitely don't recommend this book to anyone who is not already accomplished in oil painting if not pastels."
3,"stimulating, not award winning","""The loss of sexual innocense"" is a solid attempt but falls short due to over indulgence. The broken narrative is suggestive but far too inconclusive. Graphic sequences hit a little too close to home at times but the cinematography and score counter beautifully.The film is definately worth a see but not an oscar."
2,Lots of nakedness,"Although the other reviewers mention the meaning of the movie and the cinematography, I imagine few will consider these things when watching this movie. Most people will check this movie out just to see if there is as much sex in it as the title implies. It won't be anything more than a softcore porn. And for you folks into watersports, this movie may be worth looking into. It is quite possibly the only publicly released non-porno to feature pissing. I imagine finding actors to pee on film must have been very difficult."
5,awesome pants,"sporty and stylish. you can wears these pants traveling or to work. very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new ""Utlimate ROC"" pants. These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants. by thicker, i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness. the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single ""cargo pocket"" on the leg, but is not zipped. the new version has a zipper there. both of the ""cargo"" pockets are not big and bulky. you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets. So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper. the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great. I have the grey (tundra) in the normal ROC and flax in the utlimate ROC."
4,Pleasant Experience,Received exactly what i ordered and it was just what I was expecting. Was satisfied and was not disappointed. Item was at a fair price and it arrived on time. No complaints and hassle free ordering. Would do it again.
2,Not as enjoyable as I remember it...,"""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow is very 'dated'. I show movies in our apartment movie room to an audience of primarily over 70's group so it not that we are youngsters complaining about the humor, the film itself and the aucustics. It is three stories:; none of which have anything to do with the title. Of course, the film is old and hard to understand, it is also not believable...any of it. I would NOT recommend this movie altho I am a fan of Sophie Lauren AND Marcle Maestranno..."
1,poor quality of image and sound,Is there any better version of Yesterday Today & Tomorrow? The movie is great. However the video quality is too bad. It's a shame.
5,Great film but why dubbed?,"My rating is for the fil, because if I wee to judge it on the technical merits of the tape we'd be speaking litreally a different language. i am very familair with the story of the woman who kept getting preganant eo avoid going to jail, as she was a clinet of my lawyer grandfather. The fil's stry was actually negititaed in his office and I have a picture of De Sica, Loren and My grandfather Andrea della Pietra in my room. The fact that it is real majkkes the movie even more fun. Like many other good Italkioan films it shows the inherent spirit of survival - and defiance of authority - of Italians and Neapolitans like myself in particular. I don't think Sophia is the most beautuiful italian actress (I find Claudia cardianle and Sylvia Koscina more striking from those of her generation) but she's definetely worth looking at. Unfortunatley the dubbing robs the character out of the dialogue that normally features neapolitan dialect with vert colourful expressions. Peccato!"
2,"Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow",De Sica and Loren. Really three separate short films. Worth seeing but this version is not restored. The visual quality is terrible. I wouldn't recommend buying this DVD.
1,Lied about the size,"We love this movie and it was listed as 1:77 in size. When we recieved it the size was 2:35. This is call bait and switch. Shoppers don,t buy this movie unless you want to watch the movie with the heads cut off ."
3,Expression,"excellent action movie, but falls too much under a basic ""action movie"" during the end. THe things that save this from being a Jean-Cluad Van Damme film are one, Kurt Russels expressions on his face( ANd the fact he BLINKS ONLY ONCE!) and the unique approach to the battlefield of tomorrow. THe beginning with the kids being shot and them witnissing boars being slaughtered is the genious of how paul anderson can make things disturbing (EVENT HORIZON)."
3,this movie was like mad max,"i would have to say this movie was like mad max,but not only that the way they were raised to be killing machines was unbelievable especially when learning at children ages.but after that the movie got real good and was really excellent and it probably is the best kurt russel movie in a while.but i would have to say it did have its defaults and couldve been better.i think kurt needs to sign on with better writers,producers and directors and he will finally come out with awesome action packed blockbusters."
3,Don't see it unless you really like sci-fi.,"I thought this movie was pretty cool, but that's probably because I'm a big fan of sci-fi. If you don't like sci-fi, don't see this movie. The special effects were cool."

1,Thy Did Someone Decided to Produce This Movie ?,"If there's only one reason that I'm giving 1 star to this movie that's because I couldn't give it '0' star. When I went to see this film with a couple of friends I almost died laughing. The acting is terrible. Kurt's character's word repertoire doesn't pass 10 words during all the movie. I'm thinking that with my Commodore 64 I could have done better special effects when I was 6 years old. And I'm still asking myself (and everyone who watches this movie) ""Why someone had to produce a film like that and why did Kurt accepted to play this movie ?"
4,Most under-appreciated sci-fi action film finally on Blu Ray!,Not really a thinking mans movie but it was fun to watch. I enjoyed the cinematography. Kurt Russel did a great job acting seeing as he hardly spoke. Director did a good job with the budget given. I cant really compare this to any other movie but I can say that I really enjoyed Star Ship Troopers and Chronicles of Riddick. If you liked those movies chances are you will probably enjoy this movie too.
5,KURT RUSSELL ROCKS!!!,"TOTALLY AWESOME-I GOT TO VIEW THIS FOR FREE THROUGH MY PRIME INSTANT VIDEOS (GREAT MARKETING TACTIC AMAZON!)-I BOUGHT THE DVD RIGHT AWAY (PRIME OF COURSE :0)) FOR MY SON AND HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS - THEY WILL LOVE THIS FILM AS MUCH AS I DO - IF YOU LIKE FILMS LIKE THE TERMINATOR AND STAR WARS - YOU WILL LIKE THIS TOO!!! ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME - IT'S A SCI-FI THRILLER PACKED WITH NON-STOP ACTION, LOTS OF BLASTING AND A LITTLE ROMANCE THROWN IN THERE. BUT EVEN BETTER, THERE'S A DEEPER UNDERTONE OF HUMANITY LACED WITH MORAL CONVICTION AND LOVE VS PURE UNCARING EVIL. A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!"
4,Forever War taken one step further,"Sargent Todd (Kurt Russel) never had a life of his own, till he was tossed out with the space garbage because they thought he was dead...being alone is not a handicap for a one man army like Todd as long as fighting is involved, its all that other stuff that can be painful. Good action, the opening training and battle sequences are wonderful, and when it suddenly switches to lasers and spacesuits instead of fatigues, you get that Forever War feeling. All's well that ends with a nuke, must have for Kurt Russel fans and Those Who Can Never Go Home Again. I'm rooting for a sequel."
3,Good Special effects but a fair (at best) movie overall!,"I was surprised to see 4 stars for this movie. Although the special effects may be ok to test out your system, the movie is just not very good."
3,Soldier,When I saw this film in a theater I was shocked to hear such negative reviews about it.I feel this is one of Kurt Russell best films. To all those who want a high brow movie to watch and how are high brows themselves. Please don't watch. To all the rest of us who like something in the vein of Blade Runner and who judge films we are not afraid to say we like..This is the one.
3,average,soldier was better than i expected. a story of programed killing machine who finds himself in a normal enviroment and how he copes with it. i am never a fan of russel but i found his proformance different and interesting. the movie is not a head turner but it does have it's moments. if you want some light entertainment then soldier is it.
3,good action,"This movie was underrated but had some great action seens, Kurt Russell is badder(more hardcore) in this than he was in the Escape movies, he kicks serious a** in this. Check it out."
2,not really,i did not really like this movie i like kurt russell but not in this movie u could tell that is was sooo totally fake.
5,A Rare Jewel,"The first time I listened to this CD, I thought it sounded incredibly dated, with nasal vocals and songwriting that lacked any semblance of craft. First impressions could not have been more wrong.Buy this record. Be patient, stay with it, let it draw you into its unique and haunting world. The honesty, sensitivity, and sheer melodic invention of ""Genesis"" is simply astonishing. The songs have a musical logic all their own, with layers of complexity that only repeated listenings can reveal. The wonderfully psych-y Crystal Fountain song is my favorite, but magic permeates every cut on the album.The harmonies are Beatlesque, always reaching for the unexpected interval. No boring, predictable triads here--musical surprises abound.If you're weary of today's shallow, uninspired, and self-involved singer-songwriters, you need this album."
5,Great old movie!,"This was such a treat to watch while inflight recently on my Kindle Fire HD...I'm not sure I ever saw it back in the day, but it was still fresh and heart warming."
3,prefer You've Got Mail,"I bought this because of an article regarding the movie You've got Mail, which is a remake of Shop Around the Corner. You've Got Mail was listed as a poor remake of the original. Love Jimmy Stewart and the original was good but not that great. Considering that the original was set in Poland and all of the actors accents where straight Chicago, maybe for a 1950's movie it was really good. Rather see You've Got Mail."
2,"Pack of 30, not 100","The description for this item says it is 100 washers but the packaging of the washers said 30 and the package contained only 30. The product worked fine for what I'd intended, but I didn't have enough."
4,Oh an elephant needs to be loved!,"This is such a cute book! I love the contrast between what Paisley is describing and what the pictures are showing. Paisley puts a positive spin on situations which are actually out of his control. There's a lot of colorful patterns in the illustrations, and repeated readings reveal some humorous details. Our 2 year old is a big fan!"
3,A bit irritating,"I didn't like the stereotype of all Italian men having mistresses. I also didn't like the stereotype that all their wives blame the mistresses and put up with cheating.The nation gets enough of this from the Sopranos.Even though I found it hard to relate to the main characters, the book was well written. Of his three books this was my least favorite."
1,Painful,"Beware of customer reviews that may be written by the people trying to sell this abysmal film. The films real dirty secret is the total lack of any talent, imagination, or humor in this leaden and boring effort. The picture quality was passable. I've had better times during visits to my dentist."
1,Love That Dog,"Love That DogLove that dog is a book all about poems. Well, to be honest this book wasn't that a great book. Every poem doesn't go together like a regular chapter/story book. If it was a poem or a rhyming book that would go together like a storybook, then I'd read it, other ways I would never read a poem book again. If your wanting a story about dogs this is definitely not the book for you."
5,Sublime book!!!,"I absolutely, positively adore this book! It is the first book I read by Sharon Creech because a friend recommended it. It is about a boy who is a good poet. He used to have a dog and he writes about the dog in a poem. The dog was run over by a car. I think everyone reading my review who hasn't already read the book should read it!(...)"
4,Love that Book,"This has a poem for a book . This book is about a boy who does notlike poetry. The he gets into it and he loves it. It is a real page turner. It is a sad book because Jack, the main character's dog dies. It is easy for fourth and fith graders to read. My favorite poem is the dog poem. I think this the saddest poem though."
1,Bad poetry = bad book.,"What a bad book. The ""poetry"" is terrible, the kissup to Walter Dean Myers bizarre (does the author owe him a favor?), and basically the ""lesson"" is that any kid can learn to copy someone else's poems practically verbatim and be bad.Jacqueline Woodson's LOCOMOTION is much, much better."
5,Perfect Movie for a Rainy Saturday,"Vivien Leigh is beautiful to watch in WATERLOO BRIDGE, a sad weeper of a movie, the perfect movie to watch on a wet, rainy Saturday afternoon. You tend to get drawn into this movie, and it is hard not to feel sorry for Vivien's ballet dancer turned prostitute. Sure, this isn't GONE WITH THE WIND, but it's worth your time and attention. I especially love the dance sequence at the ""Candlelight Club."" What a beautiful, romantic scene. Give this movie a try."
3,Interesting,"Mzwake brings the new tone and ideas to poetry, encoporated in to music it's breath taking. Give it a try you might just like it."
4,"""mens sana in sano corpore""","H.Lamarr has been known as the most beautifull women of his time as well as a great physician..This movie is a link between the old europe and US movies poductions.So,when you have interest for history of the XXth century,you must have it in your collection.DVD making off should be well accepted ! Where and when ?"
5,Just a quick note,"I don't have time for a long analysis, but these books are fantastic. I am on my second read-through of the series, and this time I am buying them as I read them. I have never been interested in the sea or ships or the military, (I used to wonder why anyone would have a painting of a ship in their house, waste of wall space), but now I have a whole new respect and admiration. Patrick O'Brien brings the English navy to life in a way that evokes feelings of pride, sympathy, horror, elation and pure heart-pounding anticipation. The contrast of the main characters, Aubrey and Maturin, is amusing sometimes, often heart-warming. The galaxy of supporting characters is rich with personalities and details. The only character I really don't like is Diana, but she does lend another facet to Stephen's persona. All in all, I highly recommend this series, they are the best historical novels I have ever read."
3,What a strange and sad little book.,"I liked this novella, but didn't really love it. I am not quite sure why, though. Mostly because there just seemed like something was missing, or lacking, though I am not exactly sure what it was... The father's character was the focal point of the whole book but he seemed more like a shadow of a man than a real man. Perhaps it was this character flaw that made me feel like there was something lacking in the book... Still, it was a fascinating and engrossing book."
4,dinah washington,"i bought this for the father in law, he likes it a lot,it is a good cd, he has in his car"
1,did we watch the same movie?,"THis has got to be the biggest waste of resources to produce this DVD. I don't care if they restored the Arnold soundtrack, it didn't help. This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. The only thing worth it is if you want to see Arnold 10 years before his career really took off."
4,Arnold uber alles!,"I watched this last night on AMC (because this is, obviously, a classic). They showed the version with Arnold's real voice, what a hoot! Enjoy a young Arnold (still approaching the peak of his bodybuilding career, and proportioned much differently than he is today) walking around New York in ill-fitting sweaters and sans-a-belt pants, scoring a swinging girlfriend, and getting mixed up with mobsters. Believe it or not, there is a plot."
5,"So so flick, sensational bod","The movie itself was kinda stupid, but Arnold S. and his scantily clad superbody looked spectacular! (or is that PEC-tacular?)"
1,hate it,have a hard time watching it.play and skip all the time. better off watching it on netflix with my current subscription
4,Can Christine ever forget her beloved North?,"Book 6 in Canadian West features the life of Christine. She is recovering from a near tragic relationship with Boyd from book 5, and World War II looms bigger and bigger. Between jobs as the book opens, Christine attends the wedding of her big brother and meets another Mountie, Laray. Is it love? Unable to decided, Christine leaves and cares for her injured Aunt Mary. She discovers a worthwhile ministry at the local Hope Canteen, sharing Christ with young servicemen and women. An automobile accident proves pivotal for both the story line and Christine's life. Oke introduces a handsome young resident at the hospital whose family helped found the town. Christine is torn about her future which seems to revolve around her beloved North. Oke has a very surprising ending to this book, one I was not prepared for nor particularly liked. Hope this book is not the end of the series."
2,Stick with the orginal four.,"I was excited to see that Janette Oke had written two more books for her Canadian West series (my favorite of all her books)about the Delaney's kids. Either the quality of her writing has diminished or my literary taste has matured; either way, these two books were not that great. The sixth one was especially aggravating! The character development was poor; the plot was choppy. It was as if the author was trying to minimize words, frequently giving summaries of what had just occurred, rather than allowing you to enjoy it yourself. Without spoiling, the romance aspect of this book completely failed, and was completely unbelievable. Stick with the original four and skip the latter two."
1,Dissatisfied,I was totally let down when christene didn't go back for Laray! The ending was so lame! It's almost like she was tired and wanted to end the series! Poor laray I liked him better than Eric!! The whole car accident thing what is that??? Not worth the money. And all elizabeth does is worry worry worry!
3,Janette Oke book 6,Once again I haven't gotten to book 6. I'm still reading book 1. I'm a slow reader and like to enjoy what I read.
3,Nice Point and Shoot Camera,This is a pretty decent 7 megapixel point and shoot camera. The only downside is that you do need to be pretty still in order to get a clear picture. It has a normal amount of shutter lag like most non-DSLR cameras.
5,excellent cam,"This camera is fantastic. I didn't know to pick it or a canon, but any camera in this class is going to be great. The picture quality is amazing, the screen is great. Drawback is that the optical zoom is only 3x. Still, great camera, excellent purchase. Very light despite other cameras being more compact. I highly recommend"
1,What a dissapointment....1st major let down from Sony!!,"This camera takes terrible photos. On auto mode you have to take 3-5 photos in a row to get one good one that is not over exposed, underexposed or just a blank black photo with no image at all. DO NOT GET THIS CAMERA unless you want to be stuck with a lemon."
3,grill basket,"I coated the basket liberally with a nonstick spray (like others had recommended), and the basket was a little wide, but I was making small, bite size appetizers of beef, and the basket worked fine for my needs."
3,Grilling basket with long handle,This was much bigger than I had expected. My bad for not looking carefully at the dimensions. The handle is really long so if you want that It is perfect. For me... Well it is mostly a hassle.
1,Returned,"I returned product since it came with one of the clips unattached. I figured I did not want to try and fix it, because the other one might come off and I might break it while repairing. Amazon is great they took it back and gave a credit."
3,"Fun additions, one flaw . . .","There's a lot to like about this 2-player spin-off of Settlers of Catan (which I love). The knights have unique capabilities and even names. All those city improvements from Cities & Knights now actually do specific things (related to what the buildings are; for example, the aquaduct makes you immune to plagues). And, or course, it allows two people to enjoy Catan when a third isn't available.However, by design, this game is only for two players, and sometimes that can be a problem, because once one person gets ahead by just 2-3 points (it takes 12 to win), it's pretty much over. One of the beauties of the original Catan was the balance provided by having 3-4 players. When one got ahead, the other two could often ""gang up"" on him to balance out the score. In this game, it's more difficult to do that."
4,My daughter loves this tape!,"My nine-year-old heard about John Henry in school, found this tape in the library, and absolutely loves it. She's played it so much that she knows the narration and the music by heart and quizzes us on what has happened in the story. BB King's music adds a great touch (she sings that theme song all over the place), and Denzel is fabulous as the narrator. Many nights, this has been her bedtime story of choice.The tape takes a legend with a good moral, tosses in some great music by a great musician, and stirs it up with narration which keeps the story moving yet allows emotions to be felt. There really isn't an age that's too ""young"" or ""old"" for this movie, but the kids that will like it the most are probably between first and fourth grades."
4,A good book for a kitchen library,"I have this book and Bread Machine Magic. They are both good books. This has everything in it that the other has plus some more complex breads. I would get this book if you are going to be baking bread with lots of ingredients like all kinds of fruits, nuts, whole wheat breads, and if you are going to try out different types of sour dough breads (which you can only mix in the machine and need to bake in the oven). So if you are planning on doing a lot of complex stuff outside of the bread machine itself i would get this book..if you are going to stick to basics and just make really good bread in the machine itself mostly i would get Bread Machine Magic. Also on a side note this book is so thick that the binding tends to want to break if you stretch the binding out too much...which happened on mine because i kept going back to a few or a couple recipes over and over which split the binding."
3,"Pretty good, not great","The book definitely has a wide range of breads, though many require odd ingredients or unusual tyoes of flour, making it impractical for me. The recipes I tried were pretty good, though honestly the best recipes I have found so far were not from this book, but were ones I found online (for free!). Has a good section on tips for troubleshooting, but all in all I think I'll try to find a more practical cookbook. Oh - also almost every recipe contains vital wheat gluten, which I am not convinced is necessary (not that I'm an expert, just what I've seen in my tests). It ends up being another ingredient that I have to buy..."
3,Bread Cook Book,The jury is still out on this item. I have not tried enough recipes to make a determination.
4,Good Bread Book,"I've only done a couple of recipes from this book, but my husband and son loved the results. The recipes that usually comes with a bread machine isn't the best so I knew I had to find an alternative. I just wish there were pictures in the book because I'm a sucker for pictures. Other than that I'm glad I bought it."
5,Use it everyday,"Since i use this book everyday i owe it to Beth not only to give a review, but a good one at that.i have tried every recipe in this book and have crapped out 2 bread machines doing it! lol its been so much fun and my family has fresh bread for breakfast lunch and dinner.For those of you who complain that these recipe ingredients are not accurate, Beth tried her best to create recipes that will suit all machines, the HUNDREDS of them!PEOPLE LEARN TO USE YOUR OWN MACHINE! learn what order ingredients need to go in, touch and feel the dough at all levels of preparation, if its too wet, add more flour, too dry, add more liquid, really its that easy!"
3,So So,It just was not to my taste. I prefer the book that came with my breadmaker. If you are proficient in breadmaking then it would be for you.
1,I didn't expect to be kneeding!,"I love my bread machine because my husband makes the most amazing breads that make the house smell wonderful. I expected this book to provide him with recipes that require the breadmachine to do the work but just about every recipe requires taking the dough out of the machine, kneeding it and bake it in the oven. What's up with that? I thought, ""that's not what the bread machine was designed to do"". So I'm stuck with it! In a busy world the bread machine was designed to give us fresh breads investing very little of our time other than piling up the ingredients and letting it do the work.Oh well!"
3,for those of you who were disappointed with this...,"Years ago, when I got my first bread machine, I was lucky enough to discover two of the best books to go with it: Electric Bread, and More Electric Bread. (The first is listed as by Suzanne Nightingale, the second by I.C.E. Staff). While not every recipe is to my taste, I've never had a loaf of their devising fail. And, I notice Amazon has tons of used copies for sale, starting at a penny! You simply cannot go wrong with these, they're the best!"
2,Beer Bread Problem,Used recipe for beer bread and dough was so thick it burned up motor in our bread machine.Be careful with this recipe.
5,very useful and well written,The author went to great length to help those baking bread with a machine. It was very helpful for me to learn to use vital wheat gluten in my machine (even in using bread flour) in order to assure that I'd produce a loaf with significant rise and body. Definitely recommend!
2,"Not what I expected, and broken.","My wife bought this off my wishlist for my birthday. I had put it on my wishlist, because I was under the impression that the keys felt piano-like instead of keyboard-like. When we pulled it out of the box, though, that supposition was quickly contradicted. Also, one of the keys was broken. The ""G"" an octave and a third above middle ""C"" was sticking up above all the other keys, and clacked when pressed. It was obviously missing some sort of dampening pad internally. Thankfully, Amazon has a wonderful return policy. We opted for the Casio CDP-100 digital piano. It is about the same size/weight as the M-Audio PROKEYS 88SX, and feels very piano-like. In fact, the Casio digital pianos feel closer to a real piano than any of the other digital pianos I have tried."
1,Too Graphic; Too Simplistic,"Although this may come as a big shock to those of us who by now are so used to watching ""reality"" shows (as they seem to be the new attraction), a good film need not be so graphic and crammed in with disturbing and disgusting scenes to faithfully portrary the essence of events that took place in history. Those ""things"" rather can be simply inferred by a minimal application of reason and common sense. As far as the ""faith"" of the Jesuit priest in the film, it is at best a laughable caricature of the true heroics, sanctity, and wisdom of the Jesuit missionaries who IN REALITY manned the mission territories. No doubt, the simplistic and conflicted character portrayed in the film exists to only validate the worldly, humanistic spirit of this present age which can never be reconciled with what the Catholic Faith teaches. One mocks and ridicules in a state of shame what one cannot live up to."
1,My Husband bougth this!,This story is very graphic and bloody! I cannot watch it! But then again I think it is a guy movie.
5,"Best movie, ever!","What can I say that has not already been said. Via the most unlikely premise of a man trying to clone his dead wife; the story, the characters and the actors of this beautiful film convey a message of love, hope and humanity which is deeply inspiring. This is best movie you've probably never heard of. I am so delighted that it's made the transition to DVD. It would be a crime for this movie to be lost. I first saw this movie as a young teenager and nearly twenty years latter I've yet to be touched as deeply by anything in print, film or music. (Alright, ""Schidler's List"", moved me more, but this movie will move you equally far in the direction of joy.)If you take a chance on only one old-movie-you've-never-heard-of-but-people-seem-crazy-about this year: if you only take one chance like this your in your whole life, make it this movie."
5,A timeless classic that still fills my heart,I saw this movie when I was younger and fell in love instantly with Peter O'Toole as the overtly eccentric scientist who still believed in religion. So when I finally found this gem on dvd I had to own it.
3,interesting ties,"This book (#3) in the series is a good tie in from the Roman occupation of Britian and the establishment of all characters that lead the factions to gain control of it. The fictional story examines the origins of Camelot, Merlyn and eventually Arthur. It does it with a realism without magic and sorcery that makes the story possible. A very good series and a good book."
2,Diminishing Returns - Sequelitus,"I read the second book first, not realizing this was a series, and liked it enough to purchase the others. Reading them one after another, I see a marked dropoff in quality with this installment. Never strong on character, the plotting gets weaker and a lot reads like filler. If I didn't have the remaining volumes already I would not buy them. I recommend the Skystone and Singing Sword and stop there."
3,Pretty Good,"Good book, but as with rest of series, characters have a plastic, comic-book superhero machismo about them that comes across as...well, comic-book-like. However, this series does satisfy urges for Arthurian/dark age historical fiction. Parke Godwin and Bernard Cornwell do *much* better jobs of re-telling the Arthurian tales from a quasi-historical perspective."
2,Romance in Disguise,"When women write stories about mute girls who are saved by big, strong men who teach them to be sexually aware, that is considered Romance fiction and is looked down upon. But here we have the same formula: a mysterious young girl, beautiful and abused, unable to speak. A hero of mythical proportions comes to her rescue. Cassandra never felt real to me, because the author never lets her speak -- just another female character to manipulate and show the hero off to advantage.Historical fiction and historical detail are good things, when there are real characters to hold them up, and a real story to listen to. This book seesaws between long and tedious discussions of theology and Danielle Steele."
5,Abraham Rocks,"If you enjoy Abrahams message then get all of the DVD's you can. You can never hear to much, if you are ready for the information."
1,NOT THE UNCUT VERSION!,"This film is titled ""Anthropophagus/Savage Island, etc.."" in other versions which are UNCUT with all the gore missing from THIS version, ""The Grim Reaper"". I got a copy on video from Midnight Video under the original title, ""Anthropophagus"" and it was great! There are two key scenes that I know for a fact are censcored from the U.S. realese ""Grim Reaper"". The first scene is the infamous fetus eating scene where George Eastman eats an unborn baby ripped from a woman's crotch. The second scene being the end where the beast gets a pickaxe to the belly, where afterwards he proceeds to eat his own intestines. Bottom line it is a must see film for any gorehound, but beware of ANY version, unless it is titled ""Anthropophagus""."
3,stupid reviewers,"Most of the reviewers are reviewing the wrong release. Most of u guys have the DVD from some obscure distributor (the one that has no chapter menus and is the R-rated version which was titled only The Grim Reaper). Anthropophagus : Grim Reaper by shriek show/Media Blasters is the official rerelease with chapter menus, extras, uncut, etc.. So stop reviewing the wrong DVD release version. Reviewers need to do their research b4 putting a very negative posting for the wrong rerelease. Amateurs !"
1,5 star film -- 1 star DVD,"This is an extraordinary film -- one of the best Italian horrors out there. Two scenes in particular of unsurpassed gore -- and I've been watching horror for 30 years. (No, I won't write any spoilers.)I saw this film when it was first released in the theaters in the early 1980s, and then on VHS, and then on this DVD set.But this 2-DVD set is POORLY MANUFACTURED.I bought this 2-DVD set last year. It kept freezing in my JVC DVD player. So I returned it for a refund.But this is such great film, a year later, I ordered another 2-DVD set. Maybe I'd gotten a bad batch before?AGAIN, the DVD froze in my DVD player. So I tried it on another DVD player. It froze in that one too.I had to wait for the DVD to jerk past the scene, and nudge it along, trying to get it to play smoothlyGreat film. It's sad they have such a low quality control at whatever factory they're using."
3,Less is less,"Skip this compilation and buy the individual CD's on the Emarcy label instead. They should all be easlily available. All of this group's music is essential, and there is not nearly enough room on two discs to do justice to their legacy."
4,Great Disc,"Just got back from seeing the band in Marina del Rey and they were great as always......even w/Monaco's pedal board buzzing out when they took the stage, causing Chip & Donnie to jam for about 10 minutes until the board was removed. Anyway, the new album is one of their best and very heavy. Not a lot of love ballads like past albums. The only reason I give it a ""4"" is that the ""mixing"" on the disc is off. Most of the songs sound really fuzzy like the recording level was too high. Donnie gets drowned out on some of the songs. Anyway, buy it; enjoy it; go see the band! They are currently touring America."
5,Simply Fantastic...,"Radical Cure is the first book I've read by Olivia Gates...but, cetainly not my last. I'll be grabbing up her backlist asap!The previous reviews already provide the background for this book... I'll just add that this is an edgy, fast-paced, action-packed novel. I wouldn't limit it to a ""medical thriller"".Calista St. James is a smart, strong, capable woman and sparks fly when she is with Damian De Luna, a smart, sexy, capable man. The author not only writes intelligent 3-D characters, but she knows how to turn up the heat between these two.I think this book can be read as a stand-alone book, but I have already placed my order for Strong Medicine."
5,precious piece of history,This is a wonderful find. Anyone interested in the history of apartheid in South Africa will be very pleased with this discovery.
4,Bloody Well Done,"Kellerman's psychologist Alex Delaware explores a riveting saga of drugs, sex, and murder in this early work. --PJ Adams, author of Freud's Revenge"
3,This is a So-So Effort from Kellerman,"I loved Jonathan Kellerman's debut novel, WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS, but I was somewhat disappointed by this second entry in the Alex Delaware series.BLOOD TEST starts well enough, but I thought the plot wasn't particularly realistic. Kellerman creates an interesting mystery here, but doesn't do a very good job resolving it. There are a lot of big revelations at the end of his novel, but I found most of them over-the-top, lurid and rather silly. This book also contains a divorce subplot that ends rather abruptly, without any sense of closure provided for the reader.This book is readable, and I do enjoy Kellerman's prose style. So I give this book a mild recommendation. But I'd recommend other novels in the Delaware series over this one, including WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS and SILENT PARTNER."
3,OK ... only OK,"This novel starts with some interesting characters and twists but I found that the last few chapters sent Alex Delaware into some situations that seemed unbelievable and unreal. However, I read through to the end."
3,An okay but disappointing book,"This was my second Kellerman novel. I bought it after reading the more recent Billy Straight, which I really enjoyed. And I was disappointed. It's an okay story, Kellerman does a good job of creating suspense, but I still felt that this was vastly inferior to Billy Straight. The characters aren't nearly as interesting, and there seem to be a lot of subplots that are pointless and don't really go anywhere. And the ""Hollywood blockbuster"" ending borders on the ridiculous. It's still an okay read and I'll probably buy another Kellerman book. But read Billy Straight instead if you want more interesting characters and a less far-fetched plot."
5,Clear and effective,"One of the most profound books I've read. Strong on practicality, this down-to-earth volume avoids all the plan-of-the-month approaches to organizational effectiveness so common today. Research about real people provides straightforward answers to the question of how to fully engage people in their work, and still promote the dignity of the individual. Anyone struggling with employee turnover needs this book!"
5,Winnie The Pooh is a family treasure......,I loved this video when I was little and I still do!I`m sure you will enjoy it!
2,GRAND,"I watched the movie on Cartoon Network about two years ago. It's an excellent movie, I tell you. It's facinating!!! ^_^I loved the characters and their personalities. I seriously loved the art designs animation. It brings out the true life of the movie. In my opinion, this DVD is great! You should get this DVD and soon. It ROCKS! ^_^!"
5,Great Job Sunrise!,I've been waiting for this DVD since November...and I FINALLY got it. I'll tell you...I watch this DVD everyday! That's how much I love it.
4,Endless waltz must see,Endless waltz one of the best gundam movies I've ever seen. The japaneese was alot better. But a must see the gundams are awosome. The best has to be talgeese and wing 0. I have the japneese and version from the cartoon neetwork air. I gree with one reveiw maidimaia souned to mature for a seven year old. It had the wost ending I have ever seen at least they could hide the gundam or some one who still beleives what the bartons were after was right and fiht in space. well thats all sincerely ...... ......
5,Gundam Wing,I love the anime series as a teen in 2000 and owning this series brought up some great memories. Its awesome. This completed my series collection. The product arrived in excellent condition and is a great part of my dvd collection.
5,Great!,The book was in perfect condition and took less time to ship than the computer predicted!! The little girl I got the book for was elated!! She brought it to school the next day for show and tell :) thanks!!
4,Highly Entertaining Western!,There have been many movies made about Jesse James over the years. Frank and Jesse is one of the good ones! I enjoyed this very much. All Western fans should give it a look. I liked it so much that I bought it.
1,Don't Waste Your Time With This Mush!,"Don't waste your time with this trite collection of vapid, paganistic, intellectually lazy and self-indulgent quatrains. The soul of Persia and Persian literature is poorly represented here. You are better off reading Rumi and Hafiz than this twaddle. What we have here is an unrepentant pagan being translated by a 19th Century neo-pagan, and the result is an incomprehensible, senseless mush. The writer and translator appear unwilling, or rather incapable, of plombing the depths of the questions raised here, rather opting for the trite, tired, vapid and unsatisfying answers of antiquity - -and this not out of any deep reflection, but rather as the result of intellectual laziness and epicurean self-indulgence. Make no mistake -- this is lightweight drivel."
1,Amazon sent wrong translation,The translation listed was the McCarthy translation but Amazon downloaded the Fitzgerald translation. The Fitzgerald translation is ubiquitous. The McCarthy translation is not often seen.
3,They work,"As the first review said, they didn't make my ears turn green but the earring itself turned black. I wore them for about 6 months before the stones fell out on a few of them. I'm going to purchase them again though because they're a decent deal. I'd rather pay $15 every 6 months than have to shell out $90 on a single pair of white gold earrings (I have 3 holes in each ear)."
4,"A lesson, for the community, that can not be repeated too often","It is true that this is an of-told tale regarding the evils of life in the ""hood"", but, it is another interesting interpretation of the ghetto plite. This one is based on the Willie Lynch papers that gave slave owners a program for controlling slaves that many people believe is the foundatiion for the self hatred and destruction that exists today in those communities. It is also about the relationship between fathers and sons, literal and figurative, that perpetuate self destruction. The acting is impeccable, especially Terrance Howard as the adult son, a man-child still searching for his father's love and approval. Despite the previous review, this is a very worthwhile movie."
1,Torture,"When Marvin Mange is involved in a fatal car accident, he is brought back to life as half man half animal. With his newly formed animal features, we are expected to laugh at the gags that happen as a result. But all these gags do is attempt to make the viewer less intelligent. This film heavily relies on toilet humour and it's target audience seems to be aimed at younger kids. Are adults really expected to laugh at this low class humour? If we do, we should be ashamed of ourselves!Utter tripe."
2,Not the best Rob Schneider's comedy,"I have enjoyed his other movie, the Deuce Bigalow, but this one, the Animal, was slightly dissapointing to me. Especially one thing, the car accident, was too unrealistic. Some slapstick-type situations were very funny and in genereal I was laugihnig from time to time. I was really upset by the Regional Coding Enhancement protection on this dvd, because of which I could not watch it on my US-bought Apex 600 dvd and I had to use pc-dvd player. Shame on the distributoor! Is this a way to fight piracy? For me it is just a turn-off."
1,Absolutely AWFUL,"this movie was truley reched....it wasnt funny and appeared to tr ytto use rob Scnhied playing with other animals falas's to get laughs out.....however this was sad attempt and humor, they sued depections of hairy buttocks and horrses Love tackle to try to get laughs out of us.......and when rob went and made sweet lvoe to a orangetan it juist showed how awfulit was 1 star for the falsas and 1 star for him boning a monkey"
4,pretty funny,"Rob Schneider did an excellent job. I liked the movie much. Of course, it all made no sense, and the ending was totally strange, yet typical, but I have got to admit that it was funny. Some parts were disgusting and it had a little bit too much sex, though PG, you might not want to bring you kids, nor, if you are a kid, bring your Mom. Anyway, I had much fun, and it was a nice break between Pearl harbor and Tomb Raider."
5,GREAT album,"Two great songwriters. Great songs. I disagee with other review. Songs are different from each other, both in subject matter and instrumentation. One of my favorite albums from these two special musicians."
2,What Was Tobe Hooper Thinking!,"Ok. ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was great. ""The Funhouse"" was just okay. But to say ""Eaten Alive"" is even worth 90 minutes of your time is stretching it. The story is...well let's just say there is no story. And the killer, well, wouldn't even frighten a five year old. The sets look fake, the costumes are cheesy, and the music stinks. Needless to say, ""Eaten Alive"" is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. The only reason I gave it two stars is because there are a few pretty decent chase scenes that can keep your attention for a while and get your mind off how horrible the film really is."
3,Pretty Average Horror,"This movie has not aged particularly well. It has all the dark brooding atmosphere of that old video tape of a dated 70's horror movie you find hidden on the bottom shelf of a video rental store that is about to go bust. With few moments to save it, this is a case of going through the motions and any serious comparison between this movie and Hooper's much more accomplished Texas Chainsaw Massacre is laughable. The plot revolves around a hotel owner and his pet crocodile. Predictably hotel guests have their stay shortened by the croc and of course the owner with his scythe. There are bits and pieces that are worth watching such as the scythe through the neck scene. The strong point of the movie is that it keeps delivering trashy action from start to finish. Sit back and watch it over a few beers if you are in the mood, but just don't expect too much."
3,Middle-Earth is in the middle with me,"After reading this book, I found it lacking in a couple areas.I mean, i need contant action or suspence. The first part of this book failed. I was about ready to stop reading until i got to Mordor with Frodo and Sam. Thats where the action is focks. Other than that, it has a good plot and good detail. I give it 3 out of 4 stars."
5,Best of the three,"The Shadow of Mordor goes across the country land; the friends of the Ring have gotten involved with their own separate adventures. Aragorn, was shown to be the hidden heir of the ancient Kings of the West, had gone with the Riders of Rohan against the forces of Isengard, and takes part in the victory of the Hornburg. Merry and Pippin were captured by Orcs, and then escaped into Fangorn Forest and encountered the Ents. Gandalf had returned and defeated the evil wizard, Saruman. Sam had left his master for dead after a battle with the giant spider, Shelob. Frodo is still alive, but now he was in the hands of the Orcs. And while the armies of the Dark Lord are gathering as the ""One Ring"" draws ever nearer to the Cracks of Doom.This would have to be one of the best books that I have ever read. This book really brings imagination to its peak. This was the perfect ending to the trilogy for the Lord of the Rings."
3,Good book.,I was unhappy that I received a different cover then the one shown. I would have appreciated knowing which one I was purchasing.
5,Loved it!!!,"I thought the movie was good, the book was GREAT! The best part was finding out what happened to Saruman!"
4,"For real fans, this is a must have.","This really applies to the whole set, but it's great to finally have an unabridged version of the books. Earlier versions are dramatizations, mostly for British radio, (erroneously listed as ""unabridged"") but this is word-for-word. The narrator does all the voices, and even sings the songs. Some characters sound a little more pompous that I would have liked, but there you go. If you (like me) are going to load these onto iTunes, get ready for many hours of work. The 3 books are 44 disks long. And it seems that the data for each disk was written by a different person, so you will have to make many alterations. But it's all worth it in the end."
5,The Two Towers,"words cant describe the quality of this book. all i can say is that you should not hesitate to read the whole series(hobbit,the fellowship,two towers, and the return of the king) after reading the series i was immediatly in love with it. it is no doubt my favorite novels of all time. i would rate it 100 out of a 100 stars if i could!"
5,The two towers on dicc,This narrator is very good. I have enjoyed this very much. A poor narration can ruin the best of stories.
4,Following the Fellowship,"This is the second of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. If you haven't read ""The Fellowship of the Rings"" first, don't even try to read ""The Two Towers"" (or this review) yet.*** ""The Two Towers"" immediately picks up where ""Fellowship"" left off. The fellowship -- including Aragorn, Legolas the Elf, and Gimli the Dwarf -- is separated from Frodo who journeys to Mordor without them. Aragorn and the others are not at a loss for adventure, however. The first major battles are fought against the dark forces of Saruman and new allies are forged in the process.*** While essential to the epic and not-to-be-missed, ""The Two Towers"" is noticeably weakened by the absence of Frodo in the storytelling until two-thirds of the way into the book. But fear not, ""Frodo lives"" and does appear again. He remains involved in the major thread of the epic, and the book definitely perks up with his return."
5,A Great Book,"I loved this book because it was one of those you just can't put down. This sequal to the Fellowship Of The Ring is just as good as the first. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and it keeps you guessing. I loved this book because it feels like it actually happened and you are hearing from someone who was there. J.R.R. Tolkien puts so many creative creatures and characters in this book. He makes up a history of wars and detailed maps, it is a wonderful book."
1,Ha Ha huh?,"My roomate got this and said it stunk and gave it to me. I thought hey it's got Adam Sandler in it, i like so bad its good movies... I have nothing to do today, I'll give it a chance.It tries, it doesnt take it self seriously, it isnt supposed to be good, and it just doesnt work. On any level it just was not working. I can not see why this movie has fans besides featuring some actors early work, it does not stand as an independent work.It does not have any humor in it, bad joke after bad joke. As for T&A (I mean it is also known as babes ahoy) there is no action going on.It was not funny, it was sad.I got it for free and I feel cheated."
2,Worst Sandler Movie Ever!,I down right love Adam Sandler Movies all movies before this one I loved! This movie is down right not funny! I guess for a non budget movie I can't realy complain but if you are an Adam Sandler Movie fan like me you're better off renting this one or better yet don't see this one unless you want to see him at his worst!
4,A easy to read romantic mystery,"I too got the book from the library. The pain each of them felt seemed very real. Then the pain changes to immense anger. The book is an easy read that kept my attention. If the movie succeeds then I would guess they will release a paperback of the book, but look in your library if you want it sooner. Another thing, don't expect the movie to be like the book. They have changed the names of all the characters."
2,Predictable and oddly unsatisfying,"The start of the paperback had me very interested, but halfway through, I began losing interest. The behavior of both surviving spouses did not seem logical, (such as the boy's mother leaving him for months, with his grandparents, with one or two phone calls with him.) I finished the book, but did not feel anything. I will feel regret that the pleasure of reading it is over, when an excellent book is finished. It may be a better movie than book."
5,"A great book, and a review that won't spoil it for you!","First, everyone is a critic, few get paid to do so.Any work had rave reviews and negative reviews. Take a chance and read it for yourself to be the final judge.Well, Unlike most reviews, I'm not going to 'book report' it and summize what happened. The story continues nicely, and now the overall climax of the previous 4 books comes to a head. The fate of the universe lays in the balance, and it depends not only on Garion, but also his friends, Polgara, Durnik, Errand and his future wife, to decide what happpens.Very well written. I like the climax and the gradual wind down to the end (whereas many books have the climax and end shortly thereafter leaving you asking. 'what about?').All of the lose ends concerning everyone get tied up. Wow. I am glad I bought the first book on a whim recalling a good review here on Amazon.I look forward to the Malloreon!I would recommend! A very enjoyable read!A+"
4,Really Enjoyable Series,The characters are both likeable and memorable.The author weaves a wonderful tapestry of adventure and excitement. I felt a strong emotional attachment to many of his main characters and thoroughly enjoyed reading The Belgariad Series.
2,TOO MUCH HYPE!,"you know,for the price amazon is advertising for this CDits really NOT worth it! i was like for this price he bettersing like D'ANGELO and the brother can really sing its justhis musical direction is all over the place and it throws offhis vocals like they dont match with the music,but i wasvery dissapointed i did like "" 4 u "" thats it!"
3,Not terrible,Some of the songs are fantastic and some of them... not so much. This dude likes to sing songs about doing the deed.
1,Can't stand these cartridges,"With the ""green"" cartridges, Schick Quattro has always seemed like the best razor on the market to me; however, with these it's like I can't get even what I would consider a decent shave!! I really couldn't figure out what the problem was until I came on here to rant about the new design and realized there's 2 different cartridge styles available now. So please, head my warning, and stick to the green-colored ones! These are a total waste of money!"
5,Excellent value for money!,"I bought the Psyllium Husk as an additional extract to add to my power shakes - my shakes include protein powder, flax seed, chia seed, and this Psyllium husk. It helps me fill up since I use my shakes as a meal replacement. In addition, it provides bulk and slows down travel time through your intestine which gives your body more time to absorb other nutrients in your food. This is good value for money compared to my local store and is a pure product."
4,"A Nice ""Edwardian"" Way To Interpret Dreams","While being far from psychologically acceptable (or believable) these days, Miller's ""Dictionary of Dreams"" does present a glimpse into how our great-grandparents interpreted dreams - it reminded me of Mrs. Beeton's ""Book of Household Management"" and its codification of Victorian housekeeping! I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys interpreting dreams in a humorous spirit, as well as for those who enjoy authentic examples of popular history.And, to anyone who has an issue with the dream analyses - lighten up! It's just a book from a century ago - not a Jungian treatise!"
1,two thumbs down,"I was really disappointed with this book. My friend had a book of dreams that was very good so I went to the book store and picked up this one. What a mistake, this book is so negative and the interpretation seems false."
1,JUNK ! ! !,There are other deram books that are much better than this one. This book has alot of negative things to say about every dream listed. This it a book of hogwash and garbage! Research other dream books on the web before you buy them.
1,Worst purchase I ever made!...and i've made lots!!,"This is honestly the worst purchase I may have ever made. I bought this unit in Dec'06 and have updated it several times (firmware) to no avail. It constantly hangs up, I have to constantly reset the unit, I have trouble finding the simplest locations. I'm basically going to give it one more try with the latest firmware update, if it doesn't get better I'll try to ebay it for $50. I have the premium version, but no Canada maps- which I hear they're giving free now- I called Teletype, but they won't give them to me even though I paid $50 more than what they're selling them for online now- they want me to pay $45 more- If I was even modestly happy with this unit I might bite- BUT NO WAY can I support this group with more $$- I wouldn't even give this product 1 star, but it seems I've little choice....you've been warned!"
1,Where are the illustrations?,I am extremely disappointed in online version of this book. The formatting is poor and they have removed all the great illustrations. I want my money back.
3,Curious,"In my english class we had to pick a foreign author and a book to read. I choose this book because I'd never read it before, I've seen the Disney version of this story but never got around to reading the actual book. I've since finished the book and found that I really enjoyed reading it. I find that the book makes way more sense than the movie, considering that alice's adventures and wonderland itself don't walk in a straight line, but that's what imagination is all about, there is no set direction. I believe Carroll described the childs imagination perfectly.Although I will admit I was alittle lost and confused sometimes. I also enjoyed the poems throughout the story and when characters speak in riddles and ryhmes. The Cheshire Cat and Mad Hatter would have to be my favorite characters in this whole story (besides Alice herself). Its a great book and I'd be happy to read it again and again."
3,A near miss.,"All in all the recording was good and entertaining, but, the end of both stories were cut off and this was very disapointing. A great product until the end."
2,This Kindle edition is not worth it,"This review is not about the book itself, but about the $0.99 Kindle edition. Considering this book is in the public domain, I would expect to get an active table of contents for an edition I have to pay for. That's not the case here, so watch out."
3,Penguin's sticker ruins the cover,"This is a beautiful copy, but unfortunately Penguin Classics puts a retail sticker on the back cover that is easily removed, but takes a good chunk of the ink from the design off with it, leaving terrible-looking holes in the flamingos on the back cover. I have written to them asking for a replacement with no sticker, since it seems like any of the copies from Amazon would have the same issue. I hope they can replace it for me...too bad they didn't figure this little issue out before releasing them."
2,Only Two Stars for the Penguin Edition,"It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice."
2,Cheaply-made volume,"I bought this volume because several of the reviews mentioned that there were illustrations by John Tenniel. Unfortunately I failed to read the small print: keep in mind that most of the reviews posted to this edition refer to other editions. The edition I bought was the CreateSpace paperback with the pink and white cover.This particular edition has NO illustrations. It is also cheaply made -- the cover is flimsy and the binding is poor. Finally, the quotation-marks printed in this book are all straight, not curved -- as if it were typed up and printed from Wordpad.I was not satisfied with this volume. There are other volumes that cost less and are of much higher quality, for example:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Signet Classics)"
4,"Gorgeous, but impractical","I'm going to assume that we've all read and loved Alice's Adventures, and focus instead on reviewing this gorgeous edition. The design of this novel is exquisite. I ordered Alice as a test case - I desperately want to own the entire Coralie Bickford-Smith line for Penguin, but wanted to ensure the books are well made. From the outside, they're stunning. It feels good in my hands, the color is fantastic, and the graphics are so well-selected. My gripe is with the spine of the book, which is almost too tight - these aren't the most comfortable editions to read without cracking the spine. That said, they are too lovely to pass up, and a steal at under $20! I will be snapping up the collection as soon as cash flow allows."
1,No Illustrations in the Kindle Edition!,Don't buy the Kindle edition hoping to see the wonderful illustrations described in the product information. The Kindle edition is text only!
2,Should have gone with US Diver,"Bought two of these sets for our trip to Hawaii. What a disappointment!The mask looks cool and works well. The snorkels leaked water through the purge valve (making it pretty useless you like the taste of sea water in you mouth). The plastic valve was too thin and small to work properly. This happened with both sets. I am going to contact Speedo, hopefully this will address this problem."
5,There is no better...,"If jazz can be played better, I want to hear it. And this album of jazz is being played by a man who was 82 years old when it was recorded. Listening closely, you may catch the little ""tricks"" that jazz players love to throw out - just because they can, or maybe just to see if they can get a wry smile from an audience. You'll hear all sorts of emotion...but with so much accuracy that it's nearly impossible to believe that it's coming from an octogenarian. The music flies and jumps off Grappelli's fiddle with pure joy, being exuded...right smack 'in the moment'. If this album doesn't make your toe tap or cause a lift of your eyebrows, check your pulse 'cause you might be dead!"
3,Solid Follow Up,"Fugazi is the second Marillion album, coming after 'Script For A Jester's Tear'. It's the first studio album featuring long-term drummer Ian Mosley. While each track on this offering is strong, it somehow fails to come together as an album. Standout tracks are Jigsaw, Punch & Judy and She Chameleon. For me at least, this is a disappointment after the promise of 'Script'. It's still an excellent progressive rock album, and should appeal to anyone whose tastes lean on that direction. The second disc offers a few nice extras, but pales in comparison to the second discs for 'Clutching At Straws', 'Season's End' and 'Brave'."
4,A New Look-insightful and helpful,"Quite a different look at the muscular system. I didn't agree with everything but throughout the reading of this book knew there was an underlieing feeling of truth. The case studies presented ring of the same things I see in my patients. Its helped me help my patients to better health. Don't discount this book based on its 'different theory' and some poor illustrations. Be opened minded, it's only going to cost you [$] bucks."
4,The technique is not something new in other cultures.,"I have read mr. Griner's book and I am a long time sufferer of-non specific aches and pain . I have read dozens of books on related topics , one in particular I think explains his technique's efficacies.Its ""the back and beyond"" by a British doctor named Paul Sherwood. In addition, here in the Far East similar kind of therapy is routinely practiced. The only difference is they do not try to explain it. I am living proof that both Griner and Sherwood are correct and I sincerely hope one day soon some body could put it altogether and reach all the unnecessary sufferers."
2,Not very good or accurate,"I read through the context of the book and hoped to find some meaningful information about muscular problems, however I found that the authors descriptions of ""perceived phenonomenon"" to be totally inaccurate and barred by lack of real clinical experience.The terminology of hypotonic spasm vs hypertonic spasm is nonsense, as all spasm by definition is hypertonic. He makes a number of descriptions about human anatomy that make me question whether he has had any training at all. If this book is a result of 25 years of study then he may need to quit since time in this circumstance is not generating greater understanding.Nothing revolutionary here, plenty of this type of work has been better explained and correlated in many other places.Save your money for someone who knows what they are talking about."
2,I'VE SEEN BETTER,"For a game that got as much hype as Quake, it sure is disappointing. Sure, the graphics are an improvement over Doom and DukeNukem 3d, but it's just too dark. As for multiplayer, DukeNukem 3d is much more fun to play against others. If I were you, I'd test it out at a friend's house first."
4,Excellent except for...,"I have enjoyed all the series, and thought this one was one of the best. The story is well developed, and the courtroom scenes very readable. However...1) Most any reader figures out the connection between the murders long before the experts do. They weren't as smart as we are, right?2) The coincidence of who the shooter turns out to be is a little much, don't you think?3) And a minor note. Mr. Lescroart must not know Southern Baptists. He has the aged, very conservative Southern Baptist minister wearing A COLLAR (!!!), and living in a rectory! An editor should have caught that gaffe very quickly.All in all, a good read."
3,ASH WON'T LEAVE PIKACHU! or will he?,YOU LITTLE RIPPER!........ I would be saying if pikachu didn't leave ASH.... BUT PIKACHU DIDN'T......................... PIKACHU CAME BACK! for another episode of POKEMON with PIKACHU at ASH's side For a minute their I thought PIKACHU and ASH had A BIG TEAR IN THEM! because of PIKACHU'S Friends they where torn. I have no more to say on this report! Figure it out youreself buy buying it now!
2,not the first choice,"Getz other Bossa Nova album's are classics. Start with the delightful ""Getz/Gilberto"", the second best selling Jazz CD of all time, then ""Jazz Samba"", ""Jazz Samba Encore"". But by the time Norm Grantz at Verve pushed him into this, he was pretty tired of Samba.""Chenga de Saudade"" is definitely the best and ""Niote Triste"" is pleasant but this type of big band highly-scripted format wasn't his forte. It's Stan, so he's (almost) never bad, he puts on a brave face and does the best under the circumstances.Inoffensive, but quite Pop and shallow.Make sure you have the other albums above before you get this one.Sorry they can't all be great. Tryin' to save you money."
1,Don't bother,"Being a jazz and Getz fan, and having listened to Getz/Gilberto hundreds of times, never tiring of it, I was thrilled to find this album in a used record store. I listened to it 2 maybe 3 times and then threw it away. Can't even remember what made it so bad, it was just too awful to keep on the shelf and try to listen to once a year."
4,Great little textbook,"Not for a total beginner, but once you know the characters of the Hebrew alphabet and their sounds, this little book quickly plunges you into short, easy lessons containing stories with sentences 1-2 words long to start. Ten or less new words are introduced with each lesson, easily learned in the context of simple, repetitious dialogue. Each lesson also includes some basic grammar and exercises to practice reading, writing, and speaking. Sephardic pronunciation of vowels and alphabet, including script, are given in the back; I love it that practice reading and writing the script is included from the second lesson on. I also love it that there is no distracting transliteration, but the student is expected to be reading simple words from the get-go. Hebrew-English and English-Hebrew dictionaries in the back are only 9 pages long, so the book is slim, easy to carry around, and very accessible. A good foundation for more complex language learning later."
1,The Best Until It Breaks,"My monitor went out and I Am using an old ATI All In Wonder plugged in to My JVC television the picture is a little blurry so I can not tell much what I Am writing, I Am trying to find out if it is possible to have the computer to send a clear picture to the television with out costing Me a bunch of money.Now about JVC HR-S7600U and JVC HR-S9600U Super VHS VCR The HR-S9600U has a nicer remote control and 2 more MB of memory but I can not tell the difference in the performance. Using XG (not SV) Professional Master tape brightness color clear picture it's all there just like a live picture and solid freese frameBut the load mechanism is too complicated and weak to say nothing about being slow and after a while it will break.I wish they all were top load the way they used to be simple and strong and fast."
2,Far too predictable,"Read half way before I realised it was the same predictable scenes, over and over again. Invincible American, heroic street urchins, stupid Nazis. A Biggles adventure but nowhere near as tongue in cheek or as entertaining. Von Stalhein (in Biggles) is a far more clever and convincing villain than Von Klaus. Could read no further, not even to skim through to see how it ended, I no longer cared."
5,Working great,"This speaker wire is built well and has deliverd crisp, clear sound from my new speakers. Great price, very happy with this purchase."
4,One of the Best...,"I heartily agree w/ the above: ""Bugsy"" is as good as ""The Godfather""...I'm partial to mob films featuring non-italian ethnic groups such as ""Once Upon A Time...""(Jewish), ""State of Grace""(Irish), ""Miller's Crossing""(Irish),etc...Warren Beatty gives an oscar caliber performance as Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel, Murder Inc's hot-headed enforcer and prolific lady's man. Beatty's portrayal of Siegel's legendary, volcanic temper tantrums are incredible. Harvey Kietel's portrayal of the brash, West-Coast heist artist Mickey Cohen is a pleasant supprise as well. I think one weakness is that at times Beatty's demeanor comes off a little too ""human"" (for lack of better word)...the real Bugsy was a sociopath who specialized in ""rape and murder"", according to a recent biography. At time's it's a bit of a strech between between w.a.s.p.y. Warren Beatty and the real Bugsy: an unrefined street kid from the tenaments of Brooklyn."
5,A Great Movie -,"'Bugsy' is a mobster assigned to oversee L.A. rackets in the early Forties. He's soon seduced by Virginia Hill, whom he romances despite being married with a wife and children in Scarsdale, New York. He also associated with young Hollywood celebrities such as Tony Curtis, Frank Sinatra, and Phil Silvers. Traveling to the Las Vegas area, he envisions building a first class hotel, resort, and casino that would be totally legal. He estimates a total cost of $1 million, but the total soars to $6 million, partly because Virginia embezzles $2 million. Siegel had also oversold shares in the project. Opening day is a failure because of a downpour and the fact that the hotel isn't finished. Ordered back to L.A., he's then gunned down. The crime has never been solved. The day after the murder the Las Vegas mob associates took over operation."
4,Fascinating info on the birth of Las Vegas,"I never really thought or cared about how Las Vegas was started. Well...I now know!BUGSY is a slick, lavish and eye-catching film that oozes directorBarry Levinson. This is a real treat for the senses.The attention to the most minute detail is a hallmark of Levinson's work.Beatty and Bening are not favorites of mine.I personally hated the characters they portrayed in Ben Siegel and Virginia Hill.I hated what these characters did to others and to themselves. I am not a fan of MOB movies and in fact usually dislike them....but I liked this film.Why? Barry Levinson, that's why.He made this film work for me. This film is elegantly made...set design, cinematography, soundtrack etc.Sometimes you can detest the characters and feel nothing for them (hence the 4 stars!), but in the right hands anything can be made enjoyable!"
3,Watch when you're folding laundry,"""Bugsy"" has not travelled time well! It may have kept audiences riveted once but now it looks tired. It's a very long movie at 185 minutes without enough story content to warrant it.Most of the action centers around Benning and Beatty's characters (Ben Seigel and Virginia Hill) and the exploration of their relationship. Unfortunately, its portrayal consists of the same observations re-stated repeatedly and not a whole lot more. For 185 minutes.Ben Kingsley and Harvey Keitel are wonderful! The film's well worth buying if you're one of their many fans. Robert Beltran fans only get about 2 minutes of him at the one hour mark. He does what he can with only a few lines."
2,A let down,"The Simple Minds (a brass band in african chimes) and Mansun (wide open space) tracks are super, as are, of course, the two Chicane tracks (which can be found on Far From The Maddening Crowds). Otherwise, I'm really hard pressed to recommend any other tracks. Not recommended."
2,i saw it for free and still hated i wasted my time,"not a good movie. silly, made no sense, just bad. why was this a movie? eva mendez is okay and somewhat has fallen off as a lead acctress. the girl was pretty good. it wasnt her fault the writing was just ok."
2,started out with a bang but then petered out.,"the beginning was smart, witty and funny but then quickly waned. it turned into a typical movie of a rebellious teenager who comes around in the end. luved the latino flava, though!!"
4,Honest and clever mother-daughter drama,"One look at the cover of this mother-daughter drama starring Eva Mendes, and one might write it off as just another sappy family drama. That's a huge mistake with this one however, as I found myself very much enjoying the film. The film is actually surprisingly edgy, which mostly comes from the daughter character played by Cierra Ramirez. The movie really had a creative and funny yet real and emotional story.Source: criticnic.com 11-September-2012Disclosure: Film sent by Lionsgate"
3,"great actors, so-so story","I didn't laugh, cry, or come away thinking anything new. The characters just weren't likable to start with. Not any of them. The ending was the best part, but that lasted all of five minutes. If Girl in Progress was meant to be heartfelt with a dash of edgy it missed the mark."
4,"well-acted, good script","Wow, a movie Eva M. is actually good in, amazing;) An enjoyable, adult movie that both the young actor and Eva were good in."
5,"If it is Abraham, it is good",I buy all things Abraham. It is the stuff that a good life and a peaceful mind/heart is made of. The better it gets the better it gets...
3,Not that great,"Lets start with the positives: great energy boost and you feel like you can destroy any amount of weight that is placed in front of you which is exactly what this product is supposed to do. Average taste, not great but not terrible.Negatives: gave me an upset stomach about 45 minutes after taking. Also made me want to burb all the time and I got a headache right after I was done working out.I would recommend using Optimum Nutrition's Vassive instead. Its a much better product."
5,very sharp,i bought these scissors for clipping ends bangs they are very sharp like the scissors in a hair salon not like the $3 dollar ones from discount stores sharp scissors help your ends not to split when cut
3,good but dull,"This book is dense with events but except in the concluding chapter sparse on analysis and concrete detail. It is virtually impossible for the casual reader to keep the history, events, people and locations in mind, excepts for the sense (which is valuable enough in its own right) of ebb and flow, back and forth, hostility and exchange, that transpired over centuries of contact between the eastern (Muslim) and western (Latin Christianity) cultures.I also listened to this on audio but disagree with the other reviewer's assessment of the reader. This Brit should be chewing the scenery in a third rate production of Hamlet somewhere. Not only does the material-- which is not exciting-- call for a more matter of fact tone, but as a rule the reader's exuberant rhythms and placement of stress do not conform to the meaning of the text. It's as though he did not understand what he was reading."
3,Oh well,I'm a big fan of tactics games. For that and only reason I bought this game.This is a good game for short term simply because it's too short. All you can do is follow the movie story (the movie was damn long one) no alternatives. Dissapointing.
4,PDA Review,The HX2795 is generally a good product. My only problem is it keeps turning it's self on and runs down the battery. I can't find a way to make it stop. In all other areas it works like a champ.
5,Great Pocket PC,"The hx2795 is a well designed product that has worked flawlessly. This being my fourth PPC, I was happy to see HP stayed with both the Compact Flash and SD card slots, giving the user plenty of storage and options. The internet connectivity also worked well (only tried it on a hotel wi-fi network) right out of the box with no additional software needed. Just an all around excellent, well designed product. Highly recommended."
5,A smell of South Africa,"This CD is a guide to South African music. It's reveal the roots of famous musicians like Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Miriam Makeba and others. The tracks vary from clasical chorals (listen to Mbube) to some African country music with nice instrumental parties. The only disadvantage is the recording quality of some tracks transferred from old LPs. Nothing to do - it's history!"
2,The pages of this book fall out,Pages of the sonatas I was playing came loose and eventually fell out. I had to use sticky tape to keep them in. Not very good quality as far as binding goes. On certain pages the printing was very light and I had to redraw in the staff lines.
3,"A ""Suspence"" TV Movie Produced 30 Years Ago","This movie was reproduced in low quality EP mode by Front Row Entertainment in 1995. The TV movie was produced in 1974. It is an above average TV movie and is truly suspenseful with a plot twist that I have never seen before. It is a murder mystery starring Nick Nolte, Cloris Leachman and Laurence Luckinbill."
4,Re-discovered Classic,"I saw this on VHS at a friends house about 20 years ago and remember enjoying it, but not overly impressed at the time. I was never a huge TH fan, but always respected their songwriting and musicianship. Last week, I saw this DVD in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for $4.95 and picked up a copy.WOW! To hear (and see) this again on modern digital home theater equipment is a real treat. I selected the ""Studio 5.1"" audio in the setup menu and was blown away by the quality of the recording & mix. Great performances across the board by the band as well. Even if you are not a fan of TH, you are very likely to be after experiencing this one. Not to be missed!"
5,Discovery and Education,"Until I saw this video,all I remembered about The Talking Heads was ""Take Me To The River"".How much I had to learn! Since seeing the DVD,I have bought all of their albums and gained a real appreciation for the musical genius of David Byrne and company.This is a wonderfully produced movie which touches all of the senses,especially in a home theater environment.Unlike some of the other classics,like""Woodstock"" and ""Gimme Shelter"",there is no empty space or meaningless footage.Something great is happening every second."
5,Blu ray out in October!,I have MANY excellent concert videos and this one is in the top five. Both performance and production value are as good as it gets. The Dolby Digital on the DVD is excellent and I absolutely can't wait to hear it in Dolby HD on blu ray!Stop Making Sense [Blu-ray]
3,Its ok,"This spice rack is a great addition to my kitchen, however, i need to buy stickers and new spices. I dont use a few of the spices that came with the rack. I can't find a website for the company to contact them."
4,great looks,It looks great in the kitchen and spins really smoothlyI was specting cheapy materials but it really solid and shinygood buy
3,"good price, decent quality",I bought this for painting high detail gaming mini figures. Many game shops sell this same item for $30 but this ended up being about $7.00 here on Amazon. It can be fairly difficult to get it to balance right so it doesn't tip over. I ended up securing it to a piece of tile to create more stability. Make sure you have some sort of lubricant on hand too... all of the parts are rather stiff and wont move until oiled.
2,To little to Use,"This magnifying glass is totally to little. Its sitting on my shelf, because you really can't use it for nothing. Its not worth the money."
4,Radio: An Ilustrated Guide,"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this. All I knew what that I knew nothing about radio. This little comic has changed that however. With its easy to read format and great illustrations I was able to understand the fundamentals of radio production in about an hour. I'm not going to be producing any award winning series anytime soon but I will be able to mumble an 'affirmative' grunt here and there should the topic ever arise in a conversation. Overall, it was worth the money. I gave it a 4 star rating rather than a 5 only because I wish there was more of it. If you want to know the absolute basics of production then buy it."
2,"Poorly written love story, good spy story","This book needed an editor. I felt as if the authors were trying to increase their page count by putting in way too many descriptors about things that didn't need describing.The love story is ridiculous. It is forced into the narrative like a square peg in a round hole. I skipped all the things about ""our eyes met, and I felt myself blush"" etc. Come on Jonna, you are a master of disguise and you can't disguise the fact that you slept with your boss the night before?The spy story is interesting, although lacking some details understandably to protect on-going missions.A beach read."
1,Poorly Written with Virtually No Story Line to Follow,"WOW....I never thought a publishing house would allow a book to be published without having an editor read it first. The authors desperately needed to employ a ghostwriter for assistance.The story line is almost impossible to follow, the personal references to their ""love story"" are dull and self-serving and they left out significant and I might add, much required details of operations, planning and ending results all that made this book a real time (and money) waster.The storyline, billed as a look behind secret spy techniques and operations, has in reality, little to do about spying, operations, the Cold War or the CIA. You can learn more from a bad James Bond movie. The other review recommending it be classified as a romance novel is correct. This book seems to have been written as a personal memoir not for mass consumption."
5,No Just Another Teen Movie,"""Dick"" is a hilarious look at the famous Watergate scandal seen through the eyes of two bubbly high school girls. In the movie the two girls (Kirsten Dunst from movies like ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" and her latest the adaption of Jeffrey Eugandes' ""The Virgin Suicides"" and Michelle Williams from teleivision's ""Dawson's Creek"") are the infamous Watergate whistleblower known only as ""Deep Throat"". I really thought that this was a great, original idea, which makes this film so unlike any other teen movie out there. If you're looking for a funny, smart, and endearing romp, get ""Dick""!"
3,On second thought...,I am a self-confessed Watergate buff so had to have this movie for my collection. It's cute but wearisome toward the end...like the filmmaker ran out of ideas. Dan Hedaya is genius...he salvages the movie from being completely horrid.
3,"A bit formulaic, but still good","I'll dispense with the plot summary, since that's been covered exhaustively here already. I'll just say that this movie was about what you'd expect most of the time - a silly movie with two young blondes and an old guy. That's not to say it's a bad movie - it does have some very funny spots, and there are many satisfying moments of ""ah-ha"" where the movie connects itself to historical facts. The acting, for the most part, was very good, especially Dave Foley as a very believable and well-portrayed Erlichman - a number of other Lorne Michaels-related actors appear as well, including Ana Gasteyer, Will Ferrell, and Jim Bruer, who were all good, but not noteworthy. The best performance, though, had to be from Bruce McCulloch (note the correct spelling, everyone seems to be misspelling it) - his parts in the movie were definitely the funniest, and his portrayal of Bernstein perked up what could have been a very unfunny comedy."
4,Funny movie,Funny movie. I recommend watching it if you haven't seen it. It explains history (not for real but their funny explanation of events)
4,Great Movie,Loved this!! Funny look at the watergate crisis :-) Kirsten and Michelle are fabulous together and Will Farrell is his usual hilarious self! Would defintly reccommend.
1,Whatever you do don't waste your money on this movie,"Me and my friends rented this movie even though we'd never heard of it. All I have to say is it was the biggest waste of money I've ever spent. This movie was terrible. I'm a fan of Michelle Williams in Dawson's Creek but she destroyed any credibility that she had by starring in this movie. The movie was supposed to be a comedy, but there was nothing funny about it. We were so bored that we didn't even finish it. We had to turn it off it was too terrible to finish. Whatever you do don't put yourself through the torture of having to see this movie."
2,Love Ella; didn't love this CD,"This was a very jazzy album and just seemed to try too hard. I know singers must get tired of singing the same type of songs, but I didn't enjoy this one at all and gave it away. Didn't even want to keep it for my Christmas collection."
5,love the we'moon,I've bought the we'moon each year since I first found it 6 years ago... now I buy them for gifts for all the strong womyn in my life!
5,An Dang Good Cd,I never would have thought i would ever find this alumb on cd cause when i lost the alumb it made me so mad. I'm glad to have it back this is one of their best cd's ever. I just wish that the group was still together cause they was good live in concert.Rondall
3,a little slower than I remembered...and should have been anamorphic,"I remember really liking this film when I was a kid, and rewatching it, I could see why--plenty of grizzly looking zombie-like creatures and stuff (especially near the end), but an added 15 minutes of footage--not that I can tell which footage was added--has clearly made the pacing of the film a bit slow. Still fun to watch, but just expect to get a bit bored now and then.My real disappointment is that the DVD wasn't enhanced for widescreen TVs. With a very long aspect ratio of 2:35:1, without an anamorphic transfer, more than HALF of your widescreen TV is covered with black bars when you watch this film, on the top and the bottom of the film, and the film ends up looking very small in the center of your screen, and not as cinematic as you'd hope. However, the 5.1 surround mix is excellent, impressive sound separation for a movie this old."
1,Ewwwww!,"Oh Lord, is this movie ever foul! Everyone emotes like they're doing an amateur road company version of Hamlet, the dialogue is stilted and the special effects are only special in the sense of ""special education."" Truly, awesomely bad. If they were still on the air, this movie would be fodder for ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" The only positive thing I can say about this foul bird (get it?) is that it affords one the opportunity to watch Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard of Star Trek: The Next Generation) throw off his ACTING mantle and scream like a little girl. God! I will never get back the time I wasted on this piece of..."
3,"""Life-O-Suction""","Great to finally have the film in my collection, although special effects were more impressive to me at it's time of release. Definately a keeper though.Love the Nudy bits."
3,Wild romp,"This is a film that begged to be seen on DVD. It now is on DVD! A sci-fi/fantasy/horror near-masterpiece that comes up a little short at the end, but otherwise lives up to its cult reputation. It starts out as a CONTACT/SPHERE-type plot then segues into a RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD knockoff (same writer) and finally transforms into a QUATERMASS AND THE PIT finale (it is a British-shot film, after all). Nothing can beat those aliens, however. One is a hot, nekkid French babe and the other two -- well, you will have to see them to believe them. You get to see Steve Railsback and Jean-Luc Picard way overact, too!"
3,"In the blink of an eye, the fun begins!","A striking blend of science fiction and horror, Lifeforce is like an old-fashioned Hammer film on steroids! The foreign release version (European?) on DVD is a vast improvement over the American theatrical release on VHS. The London Symphony Orchestra music in Dolby digital 5.1 stereo is reason enough to add this to your collection. The plot is ludicrous though and loaded with unintentional humor. At least all the money is on the screen!"
3,Naked Space Vampires. Need we say more?,"High-speed action and a plot that drops you into the middle of it will either baffle you or turn you off (and thus, the movie as well) for the first half-hour. Make it through that and you will see that same plot nicely filled in with some rather tasty twists on the old vampire story with first-rate B-level acting, particularly by Railsback, of <<The Stuntman>> fame, and by Matilda May, who demonstrates quite amply that beauty and the beast need not occupy more than one body.Anyone who has seen <<Quatermass and the Pit>> should recognise the similarities in plot and theme, but think of <<Lifeforce>> less as a remake and more as <<inspired by>> it: good, trashy fun, pumped up for the kids of the Eighties with action over insight, with enough quirky appeal to make you stay and watch it on the late, late-night movie as you're flipping through the channels ... but not necessaily enough to drive to the video store to go rent it."
5,If you don't buy any other movie in your life...,"First, we should all be thankful to Kino on Video for having the genius and hospitality to bring these truly classic films to a medium. Now Chaplin and Langdon are essential to a movie lover's comedy collection, but so is Keaton! This brilliant, influential masterpieces deserve more than just five stars, they dserve a spot among the greatest comedies ever made. If you're interested, then these other films are good to buy along with this: MONSIEUR VERDOUX; CITY LIGHTS; SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS; MODERN TIMES; LIMELIGHT; and THE GENERAL. A must!"
2,....Kino Rip Off.....!,....Our Hospitality (The Best Film Of The Two)..Is A Lousy Print..At $22+..It's A Rip-Off...Now Have To Go Elswhere..Shame On Kino..!
3,romeo and juliet,"This book was written by William Shakespeare and it has the old language. Romeo and Juliet is a tragic story, interesting, full of problems and the story is attractive. The story is about 2 families that are in a feud. The families are Capulet and Montague. Romeo Montague is a boy who is very romantic. He falls in love with Juliet Capulet. Romeo tries to be with Juliet and Juliet too but because of the feud they can't be together. The pair have friends who help them. Many deaths are involved in the story. After the problems they plan to be together. In the end the pair dies because of love."
3,It does have too many bugs,"The reason why I started looking for comments and reviews is because I fount it so hard to believe that it had way too many bugs. You have to soft reset it almost every time you want to synch it, it does turn on by itself, it does consume its battery by itself (regardless wether you use it or not), but it does have a few advantages (one star): office docs and windows internet explorer and outlook and (another star) wireless capability and finally (the third star) the dual memory card slots."
3,Not really ready for Prime Time,"Purchased this PDA about 2 years ago, since thing it's been love hate relationship. To start off the SD card would drain all the power from the battery when left in the unit and the unit in the off position. HP provided an update about 6 months into my owning the device (kinda) and that problem appears to be resolved. The unit will not shut off by itself if an calendar alarm turns it on - that kills the battery too. The Windows Mobile OS is full of bugs - the unit won't come on sometimes, it requires a lot of resets and programs that appear to be closed are not ""really"" closed. You have to go in and make sure they're closed to conserve memory space. The WiFi works sometimes - I have a WPA enabled access point which gives the device problems. I just decided it just wasn't worth the trouble of using it for wireless access. All in all it was a good try by HP but they missed an opportunity to hit a home run. This is my 4th PDA and I won't be buying another one from HP."
1,Don't use SD card!,"I thought this was a great unit until I inserted the SD card and it never was the same.Check the hp forum. In spite of the workarounds once you insert the card your nifty little PDA is junk.The battery life was great for months - I was pleasantly surprised. It was a wonderful unit. After deciding it would be useful tool and began loading schedules and plugged the card in, things got ugly. At this time my battery discharge rate is about 1% per 5-7 minutes. None of the workarounds or service pack fixes does squat to alleviate the problem. I'm really upset because hp will not touch it - I just got past the warranty a couple of months ago and now I have to pay to fix their junk.Caution - do not use any SD cards in this PDA."
1,Pull your hair out!!,"Bought this to replace my old 2200 Ipaq; Man what a mistake! The battery is always dead, even after the HP tech support for hours on 3 seperate occasions; Patch downloads done nothing, lost information, reloads, Bugs to many to mention. I wished someone would have warned me of this pda model before I purchased it. All the good features it has don't hold a candle to all the troubles it has. I'd be very careful if your looking to buy this model. Dan"
4,A good buy,I needed this product as an organizer plus storage of some books on its SD card. The only problem I found was it is not supporting no more than 2GB memory card. Other than this I felt it serves my purpose.
1,I'M NOT GIT'N ANY YOUNGER,"I CAN'T TELL U WHAT I THINK OF THIS BOOK ,BECAUSE I'M STILL WAITING FOR IT,!!!8 MONTHS LATER,SO I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO DO THE RESTORATION ON MY OWN,I'M NOT GIT'N ANY YOUNGER...THANX !"
1,Don't waste your time with Paul Berman,"I get pretty tired of hearing that Paul Berman is a liberal or a leftist. If his is, then he is a fifth-columnist. He supported Reagan's illegal wars in Central America in the 1980s for much the same reasons he now supports Bush's wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and all over the Muslim world. He does not understand Sayyd Qutb at all. Qutb did understand the US quite well. He was tortured and murdered by the CIA working through the Egyptian police. He wanted the CIA out of Egypt and he was right to think that. No one is an extremist for wanting foreign occupiers out of their country. Why Berman can't see this can only be attributed to his blind faith in the benevolence in American imperialism. Berman is just another apologist for American imperialism. No liberal or leftist would ever take that position. Berman is a right-winger."
5,Simple,"Easy to install. Took me less than 10 minutes start to finish. Well made, good looks and zero issues trailering the boat."
2,"Useful to HARDCORE Transformer collectors, mere curiosity to anyone else.","Some sections of this book I found to be quite neat to look through, but how difficult would it have been to include the ACTUAL Transformer toys themselves??? I know he has another book for that, but at the price paid for this book, it would have been nice to at least have reference photos of the vintage (80's) action figures along with all the other stuff (would've been 18-20 more pages maybe). Some of the sections in the book get monotonous (trying to get excited about collecting every book published about Transformers is a tough request), and I found myself thinking ""who cares?"" more than once. Overall, I think this is maybe a $19.95 book, but not more than that as I've purchased many many more collector oriented books that were better AND cheaper than this one."
2,too small,This item is too small for the MP3 and causes it to push on the buttons. Made well but not useful.
1,Terrible Book!!!!!!!!,"This book is horrible. The backstory of the characters is vague at best for over half of the book. Because their was no insight into Rowena and Wulf's background - where their ideas and feelings are coming from - it was impossible for me to get emotionally involved with these people and their relationship. And if you can't become emotionally involved with the characters, then what's the point of writing the book in the first place.Terrible read! This book is headed for the trash can. I wish it was possible to give negative stars"
2,Fizzles out,The book started exceedingly well but halfway through meandered and got lost. Rather poor especially considering the great promise it held at it's commence.
4,Solid Hitchcock,"This is a solid direction done by Hitchcock. The story of an everyman caught in bad situation. Sound familiar? As it should for fans of Hitchcock. An earlier work for Alfred, you can see him still finding his style. If you enjoyed this, I would recommend ""The Wrong Man"" as well."
1,D O N ' T B U Y ! Bad edition!,"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOIDI watched about half an hour of this nasty transfer last night, it was awful: sound quality is atrocious, the print is lousy. Which I supposed lives up to its billing, ""...the best print we could find.""AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOIDOf course the Criterion Collection version has to be great -- avoid the LaserLight! The only reason I can think of to buy this turkey is the TRULY WEIRD intro by that renowned Hitchcock expert Tony Curtis. Even that is just sad."
1,The 39 Steps - Robert Donat,"I had really been looking forward to watching this movie. I had read the book and I had bought the modern tv version starring Rupert Penrys-Jones (which was great). I would not recommend the Robert Donat version of the movie. For at least 35 percent of the movie, the sound is totally out of sync with the lip movements of the actors. I found I couldn't look at the screen because it was too distracting. I was very disappointed."
2,Shoulda held out for Criterion,"Ick. Burned again by Janus and the lure of a $20 DVD from B&N.;Heads cut off, bad sound, bad picture... why didn't I hold out for Criterion?"
1,Malfunctioning DVD. Wouldn't play more than 3 minutes at a time.,"I received this DVD and was very excited to watch it with my family. Visual quality was a 3 out of 10. Also the DVD was stopping every 3 minutes. Had to reboot the DVD player to watch another 3 minutes. Quit that after two tries. Received a total of 6 DVDs in this order. Four were marvelous, great quality, but 2 were extrememly poor quality. DVD player was in perfect condition because checked it with several other DVDs. I feel that ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Penny Serenade"" were a waste of hard earned money."
1,This 39 Steps has more than 39 defects!,"LaserLight's DVD of ""The 39 Steps"" has low sound, but that I could tolerate. Every 1-2 minutes, the DVD skips several frames, causing the picture to freeze for a few seconds & the sound to be lost, losing a word or two of dialog each time it occurs during speech. Because I'd read a favorable review of this version, & because my LaserLight DVD of ""The Lady Vanishes"" plays fine, I thought it might be just one defective DVD. I tried a different seller--with the exact same defective results.My DVD player has had no problems with any other DVDs I've played on it."
4,Laserlight Edition a bargain,"For those of you concerned that Laserlight's inexpensive DVD of ""The 39 Steps"" might be lacking in quality, you needn't worry. The transfer was made from a good print, the picture and sound is fine, and there are even a few modest extras (including a trailer from the similarly-themed ""North by Northwest"" and a friendly, if not very illuminating, introduction by Tony Curtis). I'm sure the Criterion edition surpasses this Laserlight DVD in a number of areas, but fans who just want a nice solid copy of the film to enjoy from time to time should know that this inexpensive version is perfectly acceptable. I look forward to sampling more of the Laserlight DVDs of Hitchcock's early classics."
2,Pretentious and deluded,"The stories are interesting and a nice read in this book, but some written or even televised fairytale shows can deliver a lot more than this book, without the preach."
3,"Poor print quality, couldn't finish book","I bought this book some years ago following a rave recommendation, and the title really grabbed my attention. Once I got home to start reading it, I got the black smudges all over my fingers, and the really poor quality of print made it close to impossible to concentrate on the reading. I managed to get through some 50+ pages but just couldn't finish the book. I tried two or three times, to covercome this problem, but the paper color was quite brownish, and I just gave up in the end. I realized I couldn't give this book to any of my friends, and had to let it go. The one memorable part of the book was something about Ugly Duckling, and ""unmothered mothers"" theme.Also the written quality of the book is such that it is quite chatty and repetitive. I think I might've preferred a condensed version of this book. Just my two cents. Thanks."
5,Great book! Teaches us vital pieces of the puzzle of life,"Pinkola Estes is an anthropologist and psychologist who has studied ancient womens stories. She analizes the values being taught by those stories and explains how they were meant to warn the young ones about these situations in their own lives. If you want to discover these things for yourself, this is the book for you. I have given this book as a gift and it was well received. We could all use a grandmother like this to tell us of the pitfalls. And coloful stories to help us remember the lessons"
2,"Just what the Stars say,..","I didn't like it at all. Talks of building strength but lacks thespiritual side of life. Which is where our inner strength comes from.KC Seattle, Wa"
3,Just not my flavor of the month.,"I had a hard time getting into this book, although many of my friends raved about it. Nothing wrong with it, it just didn't interest me."
4,Rare find! Great read!,"""Women Who Run with the Wolves"" does something that I rarely find in books, it provides you with strategies for analyzing where you are. As a storyteller, Clarissa Pinkola Estes, Ph.D. does an amazing job of dissecting each fairy tale into bits of useful information. The book is a huge resource for finding new perspectives or frameworks to apply to real life situations. I find her work helps unravel and clarify thinking about specific situations rather than give you prescriptive rules for living. What I responded most to was Estes' style of writing. She writes poetically with lush sentences that give you tactile information. She uses metaphors in ways that invite your imagination to dream on. She writes with overflowing diversity addressing the same issue in a variety of ways and somehow in the multiplicity of her description you sort out your own view on the issue. Estes is an inspiring writer. The book is long, however, so realize you are in for a major read."
5,This woman and this book did change prospective to my life,"There are things in life that happened to us, ""meeting"" with books that are planned since ever. This is one of this.The ancient-new prospective that allows each woman to search and find her inner soul, the inner part, the feminine, that Wild Woman who can guide her in a New Rebirth.All my love to Clarissa and this blessed book.Arianna Eva"
2,Ugggg...,"I'm all for reading soul-searching materials, but this book was like pulling teeth - I felt it was translated (and poorly at that) so the sentence structure was long and difficult to follow; NOT that word choice was difficult or that it was above reading comprehension, far from it...some of the sentences just didn't make sense and I often lost their entire meaning."
4,Not As Good As the Book but Worthwhile Nonetheless,"Although this audio cassette claims to be abridged, which it is, it also contains information not printed in the book, which to me seems odd. This is the only reason I retain both book and audio cassette.Theatre of the Imagination (Volumes I and II), to which I give 5 stars, gives fuller treatment to the stories."
5,An Excellent Read,"Such a good book, couldn't put it down. Written in the true spirit of 'story telling', something greatly lacking in our world today. The archetypal symbology expressed in the myths of old are not just entertaining, but also enlightening. I really enjoyed this book and re-read it often. I recommend it highly."
5,women who run with wolves,the book came in excellent condition and time. this is an excellent book that our book club is now using by this exceptional author. thank you
1,Disposable Cover Song,"The first time I heard this I wanted to kick my TV screen in. Apparently, Sixpence think so highly of this song they're willing to sell it to the hucksters for commercial use. I'm with the LA's fans, get their version which is on a great album. I hope this trend doesn't get out of hand--mediocre bands selling cover versions of great songs to ad agencies. Thank goodness for the Neil Young's of the world who will never sell out."
2,BRING BACK THE COOKIES & CREAM FLAVOR!!!!,"I have been buying the Cookies & Cream flavor of this protein powder for the last year or so and was so thrilled that I finally found a protein powder that I enjoyed drinking, even mixed with just plain water (as I do it most of the time). The C&C was the best flavor ever. Anyway, I tried the Vanilla Cake Batter flavor just to see, and found it to have an overwhelming ""coconut"" aroma and flavor that I don't care for. I'm very sad that Essential Naturals has apparently discontinued Cookies & Cream, it's a very sad day..."
1,Awful smell! Expired Product!,I have to say this smells like arse! I don't care for products with perfume but this one smells like rotten underwear. Don't waste your money!
4,very flavorful,we've tried all of the breakfast cookies - these are the most moist and flavorful. filling and keeps you full for hours.
5,TOP SHELF FUSION,"I saw these guys in concert 5 times, so to say that I love this disc is a no-brainer. I was front row center at Carnegie Hall for what I believe was Al DiMeola's first show with the band, Billy Cobham was about 10 rows behind me. These guys helped usher me into the world of fusion and remain of my favorite fusion bands of all time. This disc is funky, jazzy, and just flat-out superb. 'Dayride' kicks off the proceedings and there's no looking back. This belongs in any serious fusion collection, get it!!www.electriceyes.us"
4,Showing what crazy is all about!!,"I never realized that Dan Slott had written a Batman book before but after reading this he needs to again. Although Batman only appears in a handful of panels, Slott deftly handles Batman's villains and even creates new ones that are equal parts creepy and cool. Ryan Sook's art portrayed the craziness perfectly and the book would have been totally different with a different artist. The ending of this got a little wonky but overall the book was fun to read."
5,fantastic!,"When I first read this, I was only vaguely familiar with the Batman villians, having read few of the comics (I am a Marvel fan first and foremost). This one looked interesting and I was instantly hooked. Great humor and story. The different narrations provided several stories to follow and the choice of art and color eased eye strain (some Batman comics are too dark and intensely shaded for me to really see the frames). It was great to see the evolution of the main character as he adapted to his new home, Arkham. This is one comic that I will be reading over and over again. A great book for Batman beginners and, I'm assuming, enthusiasts.Great book that got me started on the Batman comics. Highly recommend!"
5,Wonderful Movie,"This is a finely-crafted, unique parody of film noir that remains true to the old genre while adding a subtle layer of campy exaggeration to certain aspects. The dark scenes are blacker than noir, and the dialog is riper than pulp fiction. Cage's character is original, and his calculated over-acting is as fine a parody as I have ever seen. He obviously put some thought into this role, and did a far better job than most of his work requires. The obligatory intrigue is masterfully done, the dramatic cinematography is magnificent, the musical score is straight out of history, and the plot has more twists than my grandma's pretzels. The crew must have had a ball making this film, as anyone would who had an exposure to film history. And... it's a great movie in its own right. Well-acted, well-produced, and well edited... enjoyable on so many levels."
2,"""Pratfall"" aka ""Dead in the Water""","DEADFALL is a Coppola family grifter film with more twists than a bag of pretzels. Most flamboyant of many scenery-chewers here is Nick Cage. His brother Christopher Coppola directed and co-scripted a noir parody that is widely disdained. Considering the talent involved and the $10 million budget, that's quite an accomplishment!(Another family connection: Renée Estevez is Charlie Sheen's kid sister.).Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(3.6) Deadfall (1993) - Michael Biehn/Sarah Trigger/Nicolas Cage/Peter Fonda/Charlie Sheen/Talia Shire/Michael Constantine/Marc Coppola/Micky Dolenz/Renée Estevez/Clarence Williams III/James Coburn"
3,Review of Deadfall,"I thought Nick Cage's performance was incredibly sappy, unbelieveable and over the top-not one of his best performances. Don't waste your money with this one"
2,Stay away,"Writes nothing like as well as my old Waterman and leaks. I should have gone back with Waterman, it's more money, but much better value."
1,this is not Tomita,The rest of the reviews on this page are for Tomita's Bermuda triangle - yet this is not that album. It is a strange rock album. Amazon needs to sort this issue out - is Tomita's album available?
4,A beautiful CD,"This CD was my introduction to bossa nova music. I was blown away by the beautiful music. Being more knowledgeable about bossa nova music now, I have even more admiration for Joe Henderson's work on this CD. He treated A.C. Jobim's music with the respect it deserves and it shows in every tune. Joe was a whiz on the horn and he only got better with age. This is a nice treatment of bossa nova music."
3,Emma Samms Is Hot-Movie Not So,"This is a missed opportunity. They certainly have a good premise to work with. The head writer of a TV soap knocks himself unconscious and finds himself trapped in the fictional town of his creation. To get out of various predicaments he can write his way out with his trusty manual typewriter. The possibilities here are endless but the scriptwriters drop the ball. We get tired gags about waiting for the cable guy and what not. Anybody who finds it funny to have Dylan Baker's character bleed from the gums, pull out clumps of hair, and have a large tumor grow on his neck raise your hand. ""Delirious"" is made palatable by a game cast that includes John Candy, the aforementioned Emma Samms, and David Rasche from TV's cult classic ""Sledge Hammer"". Recommended for Candy completists only."
2,Totally Overrated!,"I choose this book, after reading all the 5-Star reviews. Wow, what a disappointment. I realized if a book has high ratings I most likely will NOT like the book. I need to stop reading reviews! Nothing special about this book. Some parts were funny but it goes on and on...."
1,Didnt work for me,"I used the pest control product for cloth moths. I placed several of these around my house, 1 in each closet, ect., but none of the 8 traps have caught any moths yet. Its been several weeks since I put these out in my house. I would recommend trying just one box, and see how that works for you. I unfortunately ordered several boxes at once hoping it would help, but so far, these havent caught any moths yet, but every coule days I see one or two still flying around the house."
4,Moth Trap Works,This product works to trap meal moth males. You'll still need to kill the females by hand and throw away any food that has gotten infested. Put out several of these traps and the problem will be gone in a few weeks.
1,Adhesive not effective,Bought these from the local hardware store because the house was infested with indian moths. The traps come already assembled and the adhesive is already exposed. Set these up in the kitchen and pantry and came back and saw the moths left brown tracks on the adhesive but managed to escape because who knows how long the trap has been sitting in the shelf. There is no protective cover on the adhesive to peel off like other moth traps on the market and so the adhesive is not very effective in adhering to the moths. Will be trying Catchmaster traps since the adhesive has a protective backing to be peeled off when ready to use.
1,Not very effective,"Since we are experiencing a pantry moth infestation, I feel qualified to rate traps. Of the three brands that I have tried, Safer is the least effective."
3,It helped.,It seemed to really help at first when I bought it about a year ago. I don't know what they changed but now I see moths flying around the traps or chilling on the ceiling next to the trap for hours before I finally give up and kill the little buggers.
3,slow to attract the pests,"I have two different brands of pantry pest lures, this one has fewer moths on it that another brand, but it does have some."
2,This product does not seem to be working!,"I picked this product up at my local Ace Hardware store. I had high hopes for these traps, but they simply aren't working. The lure seems to work, but I haven't found one moth in either trap and they have been in place for three days now. The moths do fly around the traps and walk inside only to come right back out. I don't know if there is a problem with the glue or not (I didn't want to test it by touching it and compromising the product), but I do see tiny flecks of something on the glue pads. It's very frustrating to be out the money for these traps since they don't seem to be working. It's even more frustrating to see the moths still flying around."
1,"rubbish, don't waste your money!","So disappointed, it read so well, but its been sitting there for over a week now and my abundant moth population are completely ignoring it....Indeed they are having a party less than a metre from the trap as if to tease me.... I've resorted to hoovering them up daily.... don't waste your money!!!"
5,Good product!,"If you have dogs, cats, or other critters that eat dried food, you will get moths sooner or later! Not to mention all of the other dried products that we all tend to use.I have used these for several years, and they do a great job of keeping the moths down. I would rather have a few moths than risking the safety of my food using various pesticides.One goes atop the fridge, and another atop the microwave sitting on it's cart. As the trap fills up, effectiveness decreases because the sticky surface gets covered in moths and 'moth dust'. I intend to spread some ""tree tanglefoot"" on top of the moths- might extend the life.Overall, an effective product for those moths listed on the box. If this doesn't work for you, do a bit of research to identify your 'guests""!"
5,Excellent product,"We went to a lot of work to rid ourselves of pantry moths, but we could not get rid of the last survivors. This product did just that, within days of putting it on the shelf. Best to use a high shelf because you can see the dead moths, which isn't very appetizing."
2,"works, sort of","Well, it attracts moths well, as indicated by the ""powder"" marks on the tape. On the other hand, it has yet to trap even one of them. I think I can hear them laughing at me right now."
1,"DON""T BUY: USE ""PRO PEST""!","I purchased 3 brands of ""pantry pest"" type traps. The ""Pro Pest"" brand FAR EXCEEDED the ""Safer"" brand. Right now, ""Pro pest"" has 40 moths on it. ""Safer"" has NONE! I am a researcher, so trust me that I have controlled the performance environment of each product: switching their locations, etc. Doesn't seem to matter: ""Pro Pest"" is the clear winner and ""Safer"" has yet to catch anything!"
1,Doesn't Work at All!,"I bought the Safer traps and Contech traps at the same time. I followed instructions and waited. The Safer traps, after 4 days, have not trapped a single moth. The Contech traps are almost full. I placed them next to each other to see if it was the positioning, but still the Safer traps have not worked.I could understand if it only trapped a few, but none?? We have a terrible infestation of moths and I'm not pleased at all that apparently these traps have been changed, which is why there are previous good reviews.I'm sending them back."
1,Design Flaw or Launch Failure?,"I must preface my review with the point that I'm not sure if these were out of date; I do not have the best of faith in the seller from whom I bought them. If they were not extremely old, however, I would say they are not very powerful or effective. When I have purchased other moth traps (I have tried four different brands) the pheromone pads always have a distinct odor immediately upon opening the packet of the most effective ones. These exuded no smell whatsoever. Also, the better ones begin catching moths immediately. A moth circled the vicinity of this trap for a good hour without feeling enticed enough to go inside. The next day, not one moth is in the trap. Finally, the sticky surface inside the trap is not the stickiest I've seen and does not cover the entire inside of the trap. Definitely would not recommend."
1,waste of money,Please don't buy this product because it does not work. The glue is very weak and the moths just fly in and out of the trap.
2,"ok,nothing special",He is a good trumpet player. but this CD didn't do anything for me. The original songs on the CD were not very good. The standards that played were okay but nothing special.
3,No English booklet.,The booklet is not in English. A lot of speaking in German(?). There are several chorus. The orchestra is very thin.
2,Missing quality for the price,"Recently, I tried a few of Fekkai's products. Although I think most of them are great, this one was at the very bottom of my list. I gave it two stars just because I LOVE the smell. I received it as a sample and followed the instructions. First, this is not a deep conditioner, is just a mask so don't expect your hair to detangle and get that ""slip"" effect your accustomed to. It just sticks to your hair. After I rinsed, it did not feel clean (I wanted so bad to shampoo it again) but left it on because I wasn't going anywhere(I can spare a bad hair day in my house).N-e-ways, after I let it air dry, my hair felt kinda dry and stringy but the weirdest thing happend later during the day, it got glossy (shiny) and pretty. I'll probably try it again (I still have one sample left but for the price, I wouldn't buy it. I don't think the value makes up for the price."
2,Highly derivative post-rock lacking musical depth and emotion,"This is elevator post-rock. Think of Mogwai with all the suspense taken out. It's just not fun and it never goes anywhere...just the same formula again and again: start with a guitar or synth riff, add in some drums/bass, crescendo, sudden stop or slow fade. I can't remember one song off this album. It seems like there is no ""soul"" in the music, like it is being made by a computer.I disagree with the above review, this music is not for intellectuals. Anyone who likes interesting rock music will be completely bored by this. They fail to create much musical tension, and then when they do manage a cool riff or section, it never...goes...anywhere. Sounds like a glorified jam session that was written 10 minutes before they recorded."
3,It has not reached my expectations,"ok, it is a painting book, but I did not find anything to surprised me."
4,THE GRAVEYARD OF SPACE,In Chainmail the starship challenger has met a mysterious ship with dead inhabitants from the Living race. This book was too slow paceed for a five star.
4,This is form the Preface in the book:,"I have set out in this book to write a clear, brief, and readable introduction to ethics which shall bring the beginner as directly as possible to grips with the fundamental problems of the subject. .........I shall be less disturbed if my readers disagree with me than if they fail to understand me. ...I must confess that I have learned as much from those writers with whom I may appear to disagree, as from those whom I applaud."
1,As bad as it Gets,"Ouch, incredibly poor chopsocky film with some pretty poor acting. Lots of hitting but that's about it. Save your eyes."
3,Most of this you know already,"This book is a very thin description of how to get into the Internet content provider world. The problem is that as far as the real useful information, it could have been done with even fewer pages. Maybe 10 would have been good. The content is meant for a photographer not a videographer. The most useful information is in the smaller print sidebars liberally placed in each chapter. A page on how much to pay models is probably the most useful and that information can be gotten from the World Modeling website or Luke Ford. Not much on how to sell your work, all very general information. Too little information for the price."
4,slimming and fashionable,"I like this jacket because it makes you look lean and thin. The black color and design is cool. The shortened look is in now and it elongates your upper body. For the look and money good buy. I think it looks best unzipped, and it actually looks better in person than on the model in the picture."
4,Great DVD,This is a great DVD with some real Van Halen classics. I have one complaint though.....the main reason that I bought the DVD was for the 'Dreams' video with the Blue Angels. The 'Dreams' video on this DVD is from a live performance and NOT the one with the Blue Angels. Enjoy!
4,"Needs more Dave, and Gary","I simply love this DVD. Despite the fact that I favor Hagar over Roth, I was a little dissapointed, I know that a DVD has more space than that, there should have been more Dave videos, and more Gary videos. They should have also included the ""Banned from MTV"" video from the Hagar era, known as Amsterdam."
5,must have for classic rockers,"Van Halen is my favorite group of all time. These videos are fun. I too wish they had ""Pretty Woman"" on this dvd. I still watch this a lot instead of having the ipod on. It is also fun to play at parties. Although I like VH with DLR better, I love Sammy and I feel they did great things with both singers. And you get both on this dvd."
2,Lacking so much that I'm just not interested,"It missing a lot of videos, make no mistake. In the case of the early Roth videos, the clips were so primitive (I think the three clips from their first album were all filmed the same day, just like AC/DC did for their ""Back In Black"" video and Def Leppard did for their ""High N' Dry"" clips) that it doesn't really matter if you have them on DVD or not...go find them on YouTube and watch them in all the clarity you need. But the later clips with Hagar were high-production affairs that got regular MTV airplay and should definitely be here. Like KISS, this band clearly needs to release a proper comprehensive music video collection in the DVD era.Videos not included:Runnin' with the DevilJamie's Cryin'You Really Got MeLoss Of Control(Oh) Pretty WomanDreams (Blue Angels version)Feels So GoodTop of the WorldAmsterdamFire in the Hole"
3,*Some material is edited*,"The only thing that keeps this DVD from rating a Van Halen-customary 5 stars is that some of the videos have slight but noticeable edits in them. Parts of the videos, thus parts of songs, are chopped out. It really upsets the flow of some songs. I'm sure not happy about that, but it is always nice to have some VH in my DVD library. So approach with caution. And I have no idea why these cuts were made. It couldn't have been for the sake of shortening the running time, because at 65 minutes this DVD is in no danger of having too much info for a disc side. So it will remain a mystery to me."
3,Where's Dave?,"Overall, this DVD is pretty good. The only major downfall is that David Lee Roth only has 3 videos on it. When you say David Lee Roth, You think of an individual. When you say Eddie Van Halen, you think of an individual. When you say Van Halen, you think of David Lee Roth. Good video, not enough Dave"
3,The Upper Room,"This was a wild and unbelievable story about a super human being (Mama Ruby) who was possessed by both good and evil, but mostly evil. Some of the story was pretty far fetched in terms of how the main character behaved and got away with murder (literally) with no consequences. It was entertaining fiiction that kept my attention but the characters were pretty wild and unbelievable, not to mention their stories were very exaggerated. I found it hard to keep up with all the various characters and had to re-read several of the pages to make sure that I understood what was happening. The ending left me hanging too and without closure. It was a tall tale full of black folklore, superstition and foolish fictitious characters. Mama Ruby was a trip!"
3,this book was good,"even though i loved her first book better(entitled God Dont Like Ugly) this book was still the bomb. its about this lady named mama ruby who is suppose to be a christain but is always going around ""chastizing"" people if you cross her. basically she is a chiled stealer and on top of that she is a murderer. well in this book, it takes you through the life of her daugher maureen who is mama ruby ""daughter"" and her room for the sanctified known as the upper room, and the life and the things that they expereinece. even though this review might not explain much the book was good, and i cant wait for her next one to be realeased. good job once again ms monroe"
2,WIERD DRAMA ! SOMEWHAT UNREALISTIC AND TOO MUCH FICTION !,"This book was okay. But the character of Mama Ruby began to be a little too unrealistic when she got shot so many times and lived, broke someone's arm out of socket, and buried so many people in her yard that no one ever noticed. I would give three or four stars if those type of scences were pulled back just a little. But, the author's creativity is out there and I would not put the author's writing down. The writing skills and dramatic scenes are okay. Mama Ruby was plain wierd. But, it was a good read. Perhaps not "" up my alley "". But, Mary Monroe - Still a Thumbs Up."
5,Big Mama is Bad,I enjoyed God Don't Like Ugly so much I was waiting on Ms. Monroe's next novel. A must read. It truly is a page turner. Big Mama won't let you put it down.
1,Skip this dud,I bought this DVD because of two stellar reviews. Big mistake. I really like made for TV movies but this one is bad. The first 50 minutes of this movie could have & should have been cut down to 10 minutes. I watched this with a group of people. I was the only one who didn't leave the room before the halfway mark! This film has an incredibly slow pace and little payoff. It starts to pick up around the 55 minute mark. But by that time everyone is ready for the movie to be over. This is not re-watchable. It is cheesy & slow to the point of being mind numbing.
5,funky acid jazz,"In my opinion, there are only two bands who make excellent acid jazz music: the brand new heavies (who are from england) and UFO (who are from japan). This album is simply excellent. It's funky, groovy and quite sophisticated. You can't prevent from dancing around when you hear it and at the same time, it's enough elaborated to be appealing for a demanding audience... As I was saying, also check out the brand new heavies' releases (especially shelter and brother sister or the best of, ""trunk funk"")"
2,board gets bent out of shape,Another review the set contains a plastic cylinder to keep the board from being flattened -- that was NOT true for the set I received. The board seems to easily get bent out of shape. The pieces are nice.
4,This album rules!!!,"This album rocks! Canadian punk guys do it again. This album is a breath of fresh air. Positive and upbeat, yet hard and energetic. If you're a fan of sum41, blink 182, or the ataris, you will definitely like Flashlight Brown."
4,Awesome!,"Flashlight Brown has grown as a band in the years they have been together. This is evident in their new renditions of the songs ""Lose the Shades,"" and ""Butterball."" I thought the old versions were good, but let me tell you, these are even better. Other favourites of the disk are ""Go and Die"" (a song with a catchy beat and awesomly fun lyrics, as with all the songs), ""Praise the Day,"" ""Today,"" (this is probably one of the best on the CD), and the fantastic intro to the CD, ""Ready to Roll."" Anyone who enjoys a punk band, but is ready for some different sounds, and a unique sound to each song should Definantly get this CD!!"
5,Great for counselor's too!,"Like other reviewers, this is a great find for teachers. But let's not forget about school counselors! It's also important for us to know what is going on in the classroom. A quick and easy read to brush up on skills!"
1,Christie,"Something is wrong, only approximately 1/2 of the book downloaded. How can I obtain the entire book? I enjoy this author very much, and had just finished a hardbook ""Julie. Can you please resend the book or tell me how I can get it?"
5,Let BUSH tell you who he REALLY is--in his own words.,"Read this book and find out, in plain English, (something Bush and his handlers seem incapable of offering) exactly WHO the man is who now sits in the White House.Want to know what George W. believes in, endorses, thinks?Let him tell you himself; his quotes fill this book. Warning: You may not like what you learn."
4,"Good., but not enough",Alot of new up to date information. Not enough concert footage. Would be better with complete song videos.
5,Great Polyester Fun!,The last of the lavish variety shows - Sonny was much funnier than he was given credit for - and Cher looks incredible doing some of her biggest hits. Lots of silly humor.
1,Don't buy this DVD,An embarrassing recording....surely Cher did not view this prior to release? I would recommend that you not make the big mistake I made....this belongs in the trash bin.
1,Junk - Avoid,"I don't know if anyone still has the original V-Phone, but during the time I did I was suckered into buying this thing because of the price. It was unusable - chinsy looking, did not fit the extended battery, rips easily, et cetera. Look elsewhere for a case."
2,Misleading,This particular case does not allow you to open the phone to the internal keyboard as hinted in the description. You have to take the phone out of the case to do that. The company was really nice in replying to my inquiry though. Good thing it was cheap. I bought other things from them that worked out really well.
5,Highly Recommended!,"Sometimes, not often enough maybe, a book like this comes along. It restored my faith not just in the future of contemporary fiction, but in all its possibilities. This is one of those great books. The only negative thing I can say is that I'll have to go on a fiction fast for a few weeks. It's hard to go back to anything that's not on a par with ""The Rich Part"". Thank you Jim Kokoris, for a book that as cliched as this sounds, made me laugh and cry. And I'm talking about belly laughs and real tears. Bravo!"
2,Not a fan of NeckBones,"They are an okay design, you can use them for a chair, but not in bed. You cannot use it in bed because it is to small - and is uncomfortable."
2,Dog Bone Neck Pillow,"These pillows are nice looking pillows, seemingly well made, although I ordered a threesome set and only received two as they ran out of stock. They subsequently decided to never ship me the 3rd one for whatever reason. That is fine as I'm really not going to use them as they don't fit my neck very well. I had my son try one for a short time and he didn't like it either. They need to be about 2 inches longer in the middle where the round part of the pillow is. I have a round one that I'm wearing to pieces that is about 12 inches long and I love the way it makes me sleep good. I have sleep apnea and this old neck pillow really helps me sleep without using a CPAP machine. I will use them for decoration or something."
4,Travel w/ Dog bones,My husband and I love our Dog Bones neck pillows. We have on in each car so the passenger can comfortably nap in long trips. We also take them when we fly. They do a great job of cradling your head and preventing neck strain
1,national archives WWII: war in europe,"Very poor, all clips from the highly propaganda saturated ""Why We Fight Series"". This film was just ""thrown together"" and done with poor editing."
4,Liked It!,"*This review contains spoilers* I really like this movie, because it shows the difference between a mere crush and true love. What I didn't like is how blind they were to Reese's feelings, I really felt for her, because it reminded me of a little situation that I'd once been in, but instead of the man stealer being my sister, it was best friend of 3 years. I also didn't like that the hero died and I especially didn't like how he died, because it was just really sad and stupid to me. But overall, great performance by Reese Witherspoon, especially since that was her first film."
5,Man in the Moon,"A simple warm movie, introducing probably one of the most talented actresses today. Reese Witherspoon is excellent! She stars as Dani who discovers what love is for the first time in this warm, moving little nugget. Definitely one of those rainy day movies. I would recommend it to younger viewers as well, my 4-year old absolutely loves it."
5,A very charming and heart filled movie,Man in the Moon is now my very favorite movie. I have never seen such great acting and great story line. I would recamend it to anyone.
3,Good cast; silly story,"I was amazed at the high number of five star reviews here. I'll give it three stars for the wonderful performance by the always wonderful Sam Waterston and for a great job from a young Reese Witherspoon. The other cast members were adequate but nothing to rave about.The story is one cliche after another with a lot of cheap tricks catalyzing the action---accidents. The setting is another rural Southern area in the fifties....haven't we seen this before????I guess urban folks who live in LA have a lot of illusions about this locale. And, while I'm griping...how many outdoor burial scenes appear in films? There ought to be a limit.It may appeal to pre-teen girls who still love Elvis Presley, if there are any."
3,good family film,"If you have pre-teens or teens at your house, this is a good movie to watch together.....A very young Reese Witherspoon does a fine job with this role."
5,A christmas gift for my daughter,"My daughter and I began to watch this movie many years ago on a local channel. We never got to watch the entire movie for whatever reason. So, when I found it on your website, I just had to get it!!"
5,Three Thumbs Up!,"Surprisingly, this is the first film in which Reese Witherspoon appeared. Despite the fact that she was only 14 years old at the time, she did a superb job, ending up as the star of the film (I suspect that the scope of her role expanded as the director realized what a fine actress she is). All in all, an extraordinary performance augmented by a fine supporting cast."
5,informative,"This movie or documentary helped my wife and I to start eating healthier, and to share this movie with others.Hoping they will discover a cure for their ailments."
5,Open the mind for nature's knowledge...,"Very informative,it opens a healthy discussion in the medical community, or at least within the mind of critical thinking people who do not freely swallow the information of our establishment(s)...Thank you."
3,House on Soroity Row,"I am little judgmental on how the plot is a bit lax,but I enjoyed the film towards the end,although it was one of those where you know who the killer is and you see things and know what is going on. it's not a bad movie though."
4,Colourized Casablanca,The film is aesthetically enhanced by producing it in colour.This VHS version is of good quality.What a pity it is not available in colour in DVD format!
3,It's okay because it's a classic...but...,It's okay because it's a classic and many friends have said how great it is...but...I have yet to be able to sit through it. It really just doesn't keep my attention.
4,Casablanca Blu-ray 70th Anniversary,4K is good but my LCD not support and i think waste perhaps if i have nice LED with 4K. But i love this edition. transfer picture good and average audio. But a lot of featured for this edition. i am happy because buy cheap at amazon.
5,To Adron...,"To you critcizing this wonderful classic, you must be on ACID. This has got to be one of the best movies since ""Gone with the Wind"". The movie looked as if it was filmed today. That was really cool. IGNORE ADRON'S REVIEW. This movie is worth the money. BUY IT TODAY! YOU WON'T REGRET IT! ^_^"
2,Overrated,"After hearing about this movie for decades, I finally got a chance to watch it. Guys, beware! This is really nothing but a chick-flick. Humphrey Bogart finds love, loses love, finds love again, and then nobly gives up his love. That's about all there is to it. If you want to watch a ""classic"" Bogart movie which is actually a good movie, check out African Queen."
5,Casablanca Forever!,"Most have not mentioned that the play on which ""Casablanca"" was based was written by the late Murray Burnett.( former address East 86th St.New York City)""Everybody Comes to Ricks"" was the name of the play.Mr. Burnett spent his life in the courts trying to ""recapture"" the rights to his own play.Aljean Harmetz,s book , "" Round Up the Usual Suspects"" gets into this issue in depth."" Is that cannon fire.....or is it my heart pounding"" That and all the rest of the memorable dialogue are all intact. A great experience is seeing the film at a revival house..I did...it was like a religious experience. Most of the audience was reciting the dialogue word for word. ""I,m only a poor corrupt official"" or ""its serves me right for not being musical""In a 1977 film review book it said "" remember ..not much is going on in this film"" was this gent looking for an action film?Max Steiner weaves the music in and still no one sings "" As Time Goes By"" like Dooley Wilson."
5,"Lovely Movie, Lovely Two Disk Collection","One of the great movies! I have loved this film since I was young and have seen it many times. I know most of the lines and the shots of the movie. Can't get much better than this. I bought the 2 disk version for the extras. Robert Ebert does a beautiful job in commentary and should do them more often. Many of the extras are well worth watching. As for the film, Bogart, Bergman and Henreid were never better. Claude Rains is great also. What a dream movie!"
2,This film has badly aged,"This film appears to have badly aged. Old sentimental and patriotic rhetoric about the ""tough guy with tender heart"", helpless woman who ""suffers"" because she's torn between two lovers, manichean vision of the good (Americans), rather lost (French collaborators), and bad (the Germans) guys. Even Titanic seemed much more convincing.And why is it that Humphrey Bogart is supposed to be such a seductive legend? I find him dull and devoid of expression, much less empathy. I guess most of the enthusiasm for this film comes from old-age men. Those who are still admiring the patronizing male."
5,A must have classic!,"Casablanca is a must have classic for any DVD collection. Easily, one of the best films ever made, Michael Curtiz' direction, Bogart's & Bergman's performance, the performances of the supporting cast (especially Claude Rains) and the writing congeal to make this film a rewarding experience for anyone. It is in fact required viewing because of its impact as a cultural touchstone for America in the 20th Century."
3,"Ingrid Bergman was beautiful, but...","Despite the high regard many romantics hold for this film, I find it predictable and bare-boned in its plot, as were many early films. Many excellent romantic movies have been made over the ensuing decades, but you should watch Casablanca at least once, for it has influenced the English language."
2,I can't believe that this movie was voted as the most,"popular big screen love story. There is little chemistry between Bogart and Bergman characters. The Germans just appeared to be too stupid in the movie. If Bergman's so called on screen freedom fighter husband is so important, why don't the Germans just finish him off when they had the chance rather than just trying to keep him from getting to Lisbon, duh... Ingrid Bergman is mesmerizing though, she deserves 5 stars."
3,"A good film,but not great definitely","My comment can make some people mad,but we should be open-minded. Casablanca is not good in performance and CasablancaTis triumph of Hollywood studio system,and there is no other special meaning because no element in the movie is great. You can see Bogie's best performance in the movies ""Treasure of Sierra Madre"" ""Maltese Falcon"" which are better than ""Casablanca"""
5,THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE,"I THINK CASABLANCA IS THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE AND NO FILM IN MY OPINION HAS BEEN ABLE TO MATCH CASABLANCA AND NEVER WILL.THE SPECIAL FEATURES ARE INTERESTING &INFORMATIVE.OUTSTANDING ACTING,LEGENDARY DIRECTION,THE MOST MEMORABLE DIALOGUES EVER WRITTEN FOR A FILM,THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN OF ALL TIME,THE GREATEST ACTOR OF ALL TIME ,THE GREATEST CLIMAX.EVEN IF IT IS BLACK& WHITE,I HAD NO PROBLEM.THE DVD SOUND IS EXCELLENT,& IT IS BETTER THAN GONE WITH THE WIND,BEN HUR,LAWRENCE OF ARABIA,CITIZEN KANE."
5,Great movie,This is a great classic we have watched dozens of times and we will continue to watch it. Great love story and great lines.
3,"Great film, bad format",There should be no doubt in any one's mind that Casablanca is one of the best three films ever made. So owning this DVD should be a no brainer - a must-have in any collection. I am disappointed though in the screen format of this edition. It is the o' pan & scan that I am trying to get away from. There is nothing new in this DVD; it seems to be an exact copy of the anniversary VHS tape. I would really like to see this film in the wide screen format.
3,Short & Sweet,"CasablancaI've heard of the movie, Casablanca, all of my life. I'm not a movie fanatic. Casablanca is a good 'looking' film. It's shot perfectly. The writing is good as is the acting. There's nothing to complain about and if you like older movies, I'm sure Casablanca would be a nice addition to your collection.Now that we have instant entertainment in so many forms (some not as healthy as others), and so many things screaming for our time, it's hard to give the better part of two hours for a movie.Like so much of Hollywood's offerings, Casablanca glamorizes adultery. I suppose I was looking more for the legend than the actuality of the movie. If I'd never seen it, my life would not have been any poorer."
1,defective disc,DVD arrived in undamaged packing. Watched while playing on fairly new Blue Ray player. Never went for more than 3 minutes without interruption of movie by audio and/or video dropouts. So annoying that I couldn't appreciate any improvement in picture. Only good to throw away.
