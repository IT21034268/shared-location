2,Not very strong,"I got these to hold my potholders on my fridge next to my stove. The potholders weight maybe 4 oz. Only 2 of the 5 that came in the pack would hold them up. Not worth the money, spend a little extra and buy stronger magnets. The two stars are for the two that actually worked like they should."
4,"AOC Intl 19"" Monitor does the trick","I use the 17"" AOC Intl Monitor at work and have been very pleased with it. I decided to get the 19"" AOC for home use. Having used ViewSonic LCD flatpanel monitors in the past, I was pleased to see that the AOC is similar in quality and function. I like the built-in speakers which allow you to have less speaker wire clutter on your desk. The stand is very sturdy and allows for easy adjustment of the screen. This is a nice monitor at a very reasonable price."
3,As dry as the Arabian desert,"Having studied the Middle East while getting my degree in political science, I was looking for a refreshing tale of the areas fascinating history. Mr. Lewis' book is NOT it!I tried to read this book -- twice. I wanted to like it. But both times, I got almost half way through, and couldn't force myself to read another word.This book presents it's facts as dryly as the Arabian desert. No doubt Mr. Lewis is extremely knowledgeable. But he's an awfully tedious writer. He makes the fascinating history of the Middle East, about as enjoyable to read as financial data from an Excel spreadheet."
5,Black Widow DVD,"This is an almost classic movie. However, its not for everyone. This one was used as a gift."
4,Omnibus,"When I bought this book I had the feeling it might be an omnibus of old books (because most of the new Anne McCaffrey books lately have been). But I didn't mind since I am just now starting the Brain Ship series. This omnibus contains ""The Ship Who Searched"" and ""PartnerShip"". I enjoyed both stories and look forward to reading the others in the series. I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't already have these two books but is an Anne McCaffrey fan. Otherwise, you should probably skip the book."
5,Amazing timesaver!,"I really only bought this product for two kitchen tasks. First is French onion soup. Finely slicing 5 onoins can be a bit taxing. This goes through them in no time and each is the perfect thickness. The second task is for making thin potato chips for our dog (she's allergic to most pet food products). We were having to hand slice them every week and could never get an even thickness that worked well with our microwaved chip recipe. This slicer does the job in about 30-45 seconds. We had owned a slicer before (Oxo) but it simply would not make clean cuts. The ""V"" slcing mechanism is much more efficient than the single angled blade. Much less effort with each swipe. This product is easily a third the price of the competition and the best performing of the lot."
4,A Handy Tool....,"Do you need a $200 mandoline? If the occasional slice, shred or dice is more your speed, this is a well-made, inexpensive alternative. Does a fine job on onions or cabbage or for making home fries. Cleans up fairly easily, but as everyone will attest, it's sharp (duh..). As a bonus, you'll get fewer onion tears---crying comes from crushing, not slicing."
4,works pretty well,"From reading about mandolines, it seems like you need a few different models to cover every slicing situation you may face. However, I was not going to buy more than one, and I wasn't sure how often I would use this. I wanted it to get even slices for the dehydrator, and figured I could use it to make my salads pretty, etc. So far I haven't figured out how to make the dicing work. You have to cut the veg once it's in the holder one way, and the julienne slicer cuts it the other way, ending up with dices. I have some mental block in figuring that out, but that's not the mandoline's fault. Just taking a star off because i have a hard time passing veg over the blade sometimes, it gets kind of stuck on the V point. But I expect to get better with it hopefully as time goes on."
1,Straight from Hell,Don't buy this product if you value digits and appendages. I nearly lopped off my thumb (lots of blood EVERYWHERE) using the safety guard. This is perhaps the most evil appliance ever created. I think the germans are trying to get back at us!!! DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO LIVE.
1,Phooey,"I must be slicer-challenged, for all I get is mush. In theory this should work, but give me a sharp knife instead. This is on its way to Goodwill where someone more gifted than I may benefit."
1,Disappointed Mom,"I bought this for my mother for her birthday, because she'd been looking for one for a while, dropping hints, etc. Reading the reviews, I figured the value/quality on this is high.I'm now returning it to get the OXO version. Her complaints were exactly the same as others here: Mushy cuts, lots of waste (you can't slice all the way down). I think the design is AWFUL; setting it up is much harder than it should be. She's very motivated and really wanted this, but when I asked her about it, she frankly said she wouldn't be using it.I have no idea how so many people could be so overwhelmingly positive about this item, but I am not. I'm writing because maybe someone else won't make the same mistake I did."
5,CHEFS DELIGHT,"I HAVE BEEN COOKING FOR 55 YRS AND IN 16 DIFFERENT CULTURES,RANGING FROM CAJUN-CREOLE TO ITALIAN CUISINE. I RECENTLY PURCHASED A BORNER SWISSMAR SLICER EVEN THOUGH I AM OLD SCHOOL,EVERYTHING DONE BY HAND AND FROM SCRATCH. TO MY DELIGHT I FOUND THIS SIMPLE,YET VERY EFFICIANT AND VERSITILE TOOL TO BE TIME SAVING AS WELL AS ENABLEING ME TO PRODUCE CULINARILLY CORRECT RECIPES. THIS TOOL MAKES PREPERATION AND PRESENTATION OF GREAT DISHES EASY AND EFFECIENT,AS WELL AS EASE IN CLEANING AND STOREING. EVEN THOUGH MANY OF MY DISHES WILL STILL REQUIRE KNIVES AND GARNISH TOOLS, I WILL MAKE GREAT USE OF THES TOOL IN JUST AS MANY RECIPES. MY HATS OFF TO IT,S CREATORE.THANK YOUCHEF ROBERT[BOBBY]GUGLIIUZZA"
5,Love the V-slicer,"This is actually my 2nd V-slicer. My first one got left too close to the stove and melted. Up until then, it had lasted for close to 10 years. This is a great slicer. You may not think you really need one but once you use it for slicing vegetables you'll never go back to using a knife. You can have paper thin slices or thicker. It slices, it dices, it makes julienne fries...I use it for everything. Easy clean up and fun to use. Be careful, the blades really are sharp"
2,Borner V-Slicer,"This tool will satisfy most of your culinary efforts.For the true gourmet chef though, the device doesn'tprovide the finer julienne that makes the differencebetween a nice presentation and a truly delicatepresentation."
5,Such a time saver!,"This slicer has saved me so much time!After years of wanting one, I finally decided to get a mandoline. I picked this one based on the reviews, and they dont lie. This slicer comes with a holder that keeps all the pieces together, is simple and quick to clean, and does the job it was made to do splendidly. I can cut a potato into uniform discs in less than 30 seconds with this. It's great for making party platters."
4,Great - Wish It Sliced Thinner,"So it works flawlessly. Easy to use and I feel safe with it. But I do wish the thinest setting were thinner. For the $ it's a great product, but with limitations."
4,"Good slicer, greatly reduces prep time.","This is one of the more often used tools in my kitchen. Whether getting a few onions ready for the saucepan, or making potatoes into french fries, it gets the job done faster than I could hope to without it.Not a NEEDED component to your kitchen, but a useful one. This particular slicer does a better job than some of its more expensive counterparts. Highly recommended."
2,Worked great for the first 9 months.,"First of all, respect the edges of this Mandoline when you get it. It is super sharp and very easy to cut yourself so use the device it comes with for holding your fruit or veg and you may want to consider buying protective gloves.This Mandoline did a great job for the first 9 months but now the blades seem very dull. Getting it to slice potatoes is extremely difficult and even something as soft as tomatoes is not nearly as easy to slice as it used to be. I am not sure if there is any way to sharpen them and would love to know if someone has. For this reason i would not recommend this device. The center is dull and the edges are still super sharp. This makes this thing more dangerous than it is worth and after paying nearly 40 dollars for it i am disappointed that I may end up just throwing it in the trash."
3,It is just fine.,Pros:1-It's blades are very sharp cutted my moms hand 1 time severly mine 2 time minor cut.2-Multiple blades does all the jobsCons:1-Construction is a mess not perfect2-secondry blades sticks out of front blades which means you cannot cut zig zag you have to pick up the object place it back and go again otherwise it will stuck on blades and won't back out3- 2 extra blades included does not locks into the place and drops off if you pick it vertically and scratches the surface where they are stored4-The handle does the job but i wish if it was better and could hold stuff better
5,who needs pampered chef?,This slicer can easily go up against the pampered chef version. We make chips or straws with it. It makes laborious cutting fun.
5,A slice of Heaven,"I finally broke down and got the Swissmar Borner V-1001 Mandoline after thinking on it for almost 6 months. Am I ever glad I finally got off the stick and made the decision to order it. It is EFFECTIVE, easy to use, safe and small to store. Now that summer's bounty is finally upon us, preparation of fruits and vegetables is a breeze. It's so fast and I love the uniformity of product I get. Based on other reviews of this product I'm not worried about long term durability because it's already been proven by others. I am for sure not putting it in storage any time soon as I've been able to improve my intake of fruits and veggies just because of the sheer ease of using my v-slicer!!"
5,Great tool.,"It does exactly what it says it will. Once one gets the hang of it, its usefulness, say for slicing oranges, becomes apparent. It does take a bit of a learning curve to get up to speed. Has a caddy for storage which is necessary for safekeeping the sharp blade. This is the type of tool that one realizes they should have obtained a long time ago. Don't remember what led me to its purchase, but am now grateful that I own it."
3,It's okay,"This product comes with a brochure with lots of pictures of sliced and shredded vegetables. I don't think even the most skilled person could make some things come out the way they are depicted. I've had some trouble pushing some things through. It can slice things to a finer texture than I can slice by hand, but is not much easier or faster. Still I like that I can get things really thinly sliced."
4,Kitchen must-have,"I have had one of these for several years now and I can tell you it's a super investment. I consider myself a bit of an amateur gourmet, and I am rather particular about a nice even slice and uniformity. This is a quick and easy way to get the job done. The slicer fits nicely in my knife drawer and takes much less time to pull out than my food processor. It juliennes like a dream and you can even get a nice dice by rotating the food 90 degrees and passing it through a second time. It's fast and more uniform than what I can do with my trusty knife, and tosses in the dishwasher if you like. You can do thick and thin slices, and comes with wider and narrower julienne blades. It's a very reasonable price compared to ""regular"" mandolines as well. The only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars is that I would like to be able to replace the V blades as mine are finally now getting dull. Oh well, it is still well worth $30."
5,Great kitchen tool,"I bought this one as a gift for my daughter. I have owned this unit for many years, and even though I have a Cuisinart food processor, this is so much faster to use and easier to clean up. I like the uniformity of slices, shredding, etc., because it makes my prepared dishes look so professional! It's also compact and easy to store, and when we traveled in the winters, this always went with us in the motorhome. Excellent product and still performing perfectly after many years. Be sure to use the hand guard to save your fingers -- blades are extremely sharp."
4,Wow! Easy Mandoline!,"This mandoline is so easy to set up, use, break down and clean that I keep it right handy. It's really great and gives an unmistakably elegant touch to anything you're preparing. It was highly reviewed everywhere my gift giver looked, and I echo the glowing reviews in the history of this now essential tool in my kitchen."
3,"Very sharp, but a pain to clean","I have had this for about six months now and I do not know if I would buy it again. If you are going to be cutting up some great number of veggies and dont feel like using the knife and board, then this will be good. But for just cutting up a tomato or onion, dont bother. Its a pain to clean when compared with your trusty cooks knife for small jobs."
2,Swissmar Sucks,"I ordered two of these and haven't even used mine yet. I gave one as a gift, and to my embarrassment, it contained two 3.5 mm blades instead of one 3.5 mm and one 7 mm blade.I emailed Swissmar and asked then to send me a 7 mm insert, and their response was, ""send it back to Amazon.""With that kind of customer support, I won't buy any other Swissmar product again, no matter how well it's rated."
5,Awesome slicer,"I use this mandoline with a 12 quart metal bowl (purchased at a kitchen supply store). The bowl is deep and wide enough to hold the mandoline in place. The ""V"" shaped blades made slicing zucchini (from my garden)and apples (from family) a breeze. My family loved the healthy dehydrated fruit and veggie chips. It works great on overripe tomatoes, peaches and nectarines as well. My son is a cook and he uses the mandoline to speed up the prep work. Yes, the blades are super sharp and there have been two mishaps. These incidents are known as ""not watching what you're doing"" operator error. Never take your eyes off the blade when reaching for it or when it's in use. This isn't my first mandoline but it is by far the best one that I've used."
3,Good for softer veggies/fruits,"I've used my new mandoline a handful of times and it's been excellent for softer foods (white potatoes, beets) but it was impossible for the denser sweet potatoes (sadly, my favorite and the whole reason i wanted the slicer). Aside from my inability to use it to slice raw sweet potatoes, my only complaint is that it does not have an easy to hold handle to maintain control, which makes it harder to control the slicing. With softer foods, this is less of a concern as you're using less force when slicing. Overall, a handy product that is cleaned in the dishwasher and safely stored in it's own case. I suppose i'll just have to par-cook my sweets before slicing them."
3,Ok Pop Album,"After downloading the MP3 'day after day'and reading the reviews here I decided to pick up the album. I was a bit disappointed. All in all, 50% of the tunes on the album are good but some of the more mellow tracks seem to be a bit whiney. Not a bad album but not brilliant either."
5,A New Julian Lennon?,"This is by far the best album Julian has come up with yet. The songs show a maturity that was missing in his earlier works, as well as a sensitivity that is refreshing in music today. Each song feels like it was put together with thought and foresight. There is none of the ""filler"" that seemed prevelant on his other albums. One of the most interesting elements to this album is the way that the author's spirituality is interspersed throughout the songs. The listner is given a definite glimpse into Lennon's private world, one in which heaven and earth are given a chance to blend together wonderfully. Photograph Smile takes the leap that Saltwater promised us years ago. I think with this album Julian has bought himself a new lease on musical life, and I can't wait to see what he does next."
5,AWESOME!!!,"I thought Photograph Smile was GREAT! All the songs are wonderful, and I would recommend this album to ANYONE! GOOD JOB JULES!!"
5,Happy to find Sugar Daddy pops online...,"This is one of my hubby's favorite candies. We have trouble finding them in our city. We used to resort to buying bags of Halloween candy that would have some mixed in it. Last year, we couldn't even find those. So, I did an online search, found them, purchased them & my hubby's eating them. They arrived fresh, and tasty. So very, very glad I found these online.In case you're wondering, Sugar Daddy lollipops are milk caramel. They come in two sizes; this is the smaller size & approx. 1""x2""x1/4"" not including the stick. If you chew on them they will get stuck in your teeth."
1,Inland Pro LCD Monitor Arm 200,This unit does not have any counter resistance so you have to screw it in a fixed position to keep it from falling. You get what to pay for.
5,no bleeder !,"This early film by the Coen brothers is a great example of their unique style. Read the editorial review for the story. What's so great about this movie is not so much the story, but the way in which it is told. The performances, the use of sounds and music (jukebox, windscreen wipers), the attention for details, the overall un-Hollywoodlike ordinariness of living conditions (nothing glossy here), ... A must see for the discerning movie buff. Frances McDormand is great, but M. Emmet Walsh steals the show with his performance."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"Every dialogue exchange is slow and tedious. Waiting for a pertinent piece of information to drop is an exercise in patience and endurance. The characters are never established, nor developed enough to even like or dislike them or have much understanding of what motivates anything they do."
5,Transaction was GREAT - movie was adequate,"I love the Cohen brothers and could not wait to see their first movie. It was good, not great, no Fargo...The retailer was reputable - shipping was very quick."
3,excellent film,"The commentary track on this dvd is a ""meh"" joke. It's a scripted parody of all the worst commentary tracks you've ever heard. A ""scholarly"" voice drones on and on - repeating what's on the screen, making irritatingly obvious observations on technique, and goofily stabbing at vague academic analysis. Considering all the genuinely funny and sincerely crappy commentaries there are out there (Battlefield Earth anyone? Marion ""It's-A-Phallus"" Keane's Criterion work?) Blood Simple's joke track is pretty lame.Excellent film though. I'd rate it higher than most of their subsequent work. Nice transfer."
2,Dull Blade,Right out of the box the blade is dull and the grind is poor. I sent an email looking for a response 2 weeks ago but no response yet.
5,A great gay novel,"This is a book to savor. A sweeping, historic story of the American gay experience. The characters are beatiful and their stories are wonderfully told. It is warm, witty and heartbreaking. Already a substantial book, the reader still wishes there were more when the last page appears."
5,Stonewall comes brilliantly to life,"A sweeping, sometimes poignant, but nevertheless historically relevant tale of gay life in America pre and post Stonewall. Mordden's novel captures the essense of gay life by presenting characters that we can believe in and with whom we can commiserate. Wonderfully readable and certainly entertaining."
3,How Long Is This Book Going To Go On?,"Ethan Mordden has attempted to write an epic novel and, sadly, he is just not up to the task. At 590 pages, it is about 250 pages too long. There are too many characters and too many sad things happen to them; who can keep track of it all (or even stay interested in)? The author has a habit of periodically switching into the first person, which is completely out of context with the flow of the story. Still, some of the main characters are interesting, which is why what happens to them is depressing. If this is to be considered an accurate portrayal of gay life in America from 1949 to 1991, it is a downbeat commentary."
5,Beautiful Music,I love hymns played on the piano and this is the best I have ever heard. I played it in my hospital room while recovering from open heart surgery and the music provided the peace that I needed to get through the recovery period. Buy this album - you won't be disappointed.
4,ohhhhhhhh shocktreatment,fist off you must remeber shocktreatment is not a sequel to rocky horror picture show.its a spin-off.i think the songs are pretty good maybe not as good as the rocky horrore picture show ones but close.the story is hard to figure out(not really explained good)but it is defainally a uninque one of a kind movie.its stange and weird and is in a world of its own.its not as reconized and popular as rocky horrore but holds its own.like i said before dont expect it to be a sequel its a coplete new story.
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!,"If there was a half a star I would put that, better yet no stars! I was terribly disappointed in this movie. The plot stinks, its hard to follow and the songs suck. Ok Brad was singing about appliances... this had nothing to do with RHPS, I wasted my money and no one should buy this movie! It wasnt a sequel like it said, it didnt leave off where RHPS ended LIKE IT SAID!!! If you buy this movie you will be wasting your money because I couldnt even watch the whole thing it was putting me to sleep!! LITERALLY! Richard O'Brien did an aweful job with this one, all my friends hated it! THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!!"
5,"Great music, bad acting, good movie.","It is pretty obvious that this is nothing near RHPS, but watch it more than once and you are hooked."
2,Just.. don't,Hated Rocky..Well.. I hated it on video dvd or any other way you might use to view it at home..Actually going to the show paying your money and getting the bag full of goodies to throw..Every week for years.. I almost got recruited to play Brad.. I knew better by the time they tried to get me to join though..That said.. mentioning Shock Treatment in that crowed 'The biggest group fans you are likely to find of the person responsible for this film' results in variety of horrified reactions and warning never to ever see it..Although if you must or feel a unresistible compulsion to watch this film.. alcohol helps.. you will need a lot of it however..
5,Fascinating satirical social commentary,"Shock Treatment is a satirical social commentary, showing how modern democracies often end up being controlled through the media by clever politicians."
2,Disapointing,"The movie is a big disapointment,visual effects seemed from the 60's,and if you are hoping for nude scenes of the hot Rose,then you'll be even more disapointed"
3,Not the best Enron book,Read Sherron Watkins' book Power Failure instead. Its a better read and gets the story right.
2,Poorly written & sloppily edited,"This book is somewhat informative, and it definitely has a few high points of narrative flair. But the author too frequently veers away from factual storytelling (...) and lurches into shrill, polticized rants against capitalism and big business. .... Someone looking for an objective account of the Enron saga would be better served by one of the other Enron tomes on the market. My copy also had numerous typographical, spelling, and punctuation errors."
5,"Bad, Bad Boys (and Girls)","As evil and corrupt as I thought some of my co-workers were, I only saw the surface until Robert Bryce scraped away the top layer of slime and exposed some of the most devious outlaws to ever drive their expensive vehicles on the Houston streets. This fast paced, witty and clearly written book can make you both laugh and cry whether you were inside or outside of this company. A must read for any present or past college student who's education was paid for with ""daddy's ill gotten gains"" from Enron."
5,The policy flaws that allowed scandal to happen,"Pipe Dreams: Greed, Ego, And The Death Of Enron by Robert Bryce offers a compelling and in-depth descriptive survey and history of the origins of the Enron financial scandal, the policy flaws that allowed it to happen, the individuals in the thick of money laundering and account book cooking, as well as cogent insights in how to avoid similar corporate disasters in the future. An exceptionally well-researched, highly readable account of scandal, fraud, and outright corporate greed, Pipe Dreams is strongly recommended reading for all members of the business community, as well as the non-specialist general public wanting to know how such a tragic and illicit state of affairs could happen -- and how want to ensure that it never happens again."
4,I wish I had more old techno comps after sampling this,"This CD is an interesting one. It helps you to see how repetetive some of these tracks might sound, but for '92, these artists were the cutting edge of the growing sound which we all love in raves and everywhere! I loved the Drastik Measures song (one of the first to bring back old melodies that people know into techno environment), especially because they combined the melody that we knew with an original-souding rhythm section unlike today's uhn-tiss-uh-tiss background drums.The only reason why this would fall back in the ratings is for the repetetive, dated feel to the tracks. Most had some element of original thinking in their compositions for the time (and what about the haunting inclusion of the Formicula 4 track?). Interesting to say the least, if you like techno, make sure this is in the collection for posterity."
1,The Reference Set that Wasn't,"This is the simplest Review I've written for an amazon order. The Reference set is junk: poor quality paper, font barely larger than an average garden variety ant, printed so lightly I suspect you'll squint in the brightest light. Save your time and money. I'm lookin' at the Oxford combo-book which sells for less, printed on bright white paper in a large font using adequate ink enabling the text to stand out from the page.As usual, delivery by amazon was terrific, now we'll see how they handle the return of the 'set' which I believe is the 1st time I've ever returned to them. I'm a committed amazon client/supporter and this has nothing to do with amazon and everything to do with Merriam-Webster."
3,Not Good,"As die hard ""Duke"" fans it's hard to say when we don't like a JW movie. But it is what it is - bad acting ( We love Jennifer O'Neil but her acting was just as bad), just bad - we kept the movie just to remind us not to buy it again by mistake :). We could also say this wouldn't be DOVE movie review approved (cursing (though they never curse the Lord's name), lots of drinking, some nudity).Just keep looking nothing to see here........"
5,a wonderful pony opera,"Top of the line, good dialogue; a classic Wayne movie. It's not quite El Dorado or Rio Bravo, but it's a good enough to hole the interest and to fulfill that yern for the old west.AGP"
1,I ordered a 21 piece socket set and received a set of 9 sockets.,"Bahco Snap On 804921 21 Piece 3/8-Inch Drive 3/8-Inch to 7/8-Inch 6 Point Standard and Deep Socket SetI wish I could give an accurate review, but Chumbadeals sent me a nine piece set of sockets with no ratchet, no extensions, no deep sockets, just eight standard sockets and a socket holder. Neither Chumadeals, nor Amazon.com were willing to make this shipping error right. So now I own this $7.99 set of sockets ( I found them at a local store for that much) for $65.00. Please be careful dealing with either company."
4,"good for the family, even men. lol","i like the ""manly"" movies but i really did enjoy this and so do my kids, when they were young, and now that they are adults they still enjoy this very much. good for everyone who enjoys a good laugh, and has any kind of a heart."
5,Paulie,"I really love this movie. Paulie's life story is very sweet and touching. It looks at the different relationships he develops with the people (and animals) he encounters on his many journeys. He is essentially on a life long quest to be reunited with his first owner, a little girl with a speech impediment. He meets many people, some unsavory, some helpful and kind, some selfish, some colorful, along the way that makes this an endearing movie that moves me to tears at points. There is some language that is not appropriate for children although it seems to be geared towards a younger audience. I think adults will also find this movie fun, funny and touching."
4,Who couldn't love a talking bird?,"I bought this movie because it was the first movie my wife and i saw when we first started dating. All the same, if it sucked i wouldn't have bought it. It's cute and has a few lessons about life. And it comes full circle at the end. A good story with characters that develop along the way. When the man who ends up rescuing the bird first entices it to give up his secret silence, it is hysterical."
3,Range sucks,"I have replaced the batteries and the mouse and keypad has a range of about 6 inches from the dongle. It is the worst wireless device I have ever used as faar as the range goes!!!! I gave it 3 stars because it does work as stated you just need a usb extender and tape the dongle to the keypad!!!!! Too bad, I really wanted this to work."
1,I threw it out!,I'm not a movie buff... and usually like some movies that the critics hate... but THIS movie was sooooo boring boring boring boring... I threw it out rather than burden anyone else with this waste of time.
3,A Cliche,"This was over-rated. It's just a goof with a great soundtrack. They stuffed the movie with big names and hatched-up a plot by stringing together as many southern legends and symbols as possible-chain gangs, floods, prison escapes, shady politicians, bank robbers, crooked Bible salesmen, the King Biskuit Flower hour radio show, the blues-man who meets the devil at a crossroads at midnight, and on and on. These sore thumbs were so glaring, it's almost an insult to the intelligence."
5,"Oh, Brother! What a movie!",Thoroughly enjoyable movie. Kudos to the Coen Brothers for their take on Homer's Odyssey! This movie shows the viewer the pure fun of acting. Loved it.
4,O' Brother--it's original and a hoot,"As with all Coen brothers movies, it is off-beat and unlike anything else out there. Those that don't appreciate the Coen's will say 'thank god', but for those of us who look forward to anything they come out with, it is worth seeing. I'd put it a notch or two behind Fargo, but Clooney, Turturro and Blake are all great. Clooney as the silver-tongued lawyer wasting his insights on his fellow escaped convicts with a combined IQ in the single digits. It's not standard Hollywood fare, but it is entertaining, funny throughout and the music is enjoyable."
2,O Brother Where Art Thou,"I did not care at all for this movie. A friend had asked me to get it for him for Christmas, so we watched it together, and I just didn't like it . Thought it was boring."
2,weird,this movie has no plot.they just run around and crazy stuff happens to them. it its just beyond weird.the music is pretty great through.buy the soundtrack but skip the movie
5,One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time,"Now when I first saw this movie I thought is was going to really boring, but I have to admitt that I found this movie to be one of the funniest that I have ever seen. If you are thinking of buying this movie then good for you. It is well worth the money."
1,Don't waste your time or money,Talk about low-brow humor! There were a couple of funny moments and other than that this movie was painfully slow moving and boring even with George Clooney starring!
2,::::: Yawn :::::,I know George Clooney is one of the biggest stars but he is such a ham actor who belong in the league with corey feldman's and scott baio's . This movie is trying too hard to be funny . The only reason i am giving this 2 stars is for the music and scenery
1,Assinine,"This is one of the worst movies I ever saw, just a total insult to the intelligence and to the south. Mindless. Idiotic. Worse than the 3 Stooges. I can't believe such garbage was ever produced."
4,new and creative,"this movie is very inventive, and has new and different entertaining characterizations. putting handsome george clooney as the lead shows that he can poke fun at his gorgeous george image."
4,The more you watch the more you see.,"If you are thinking of purchasing O Brother, you are getting a movie that is not a one time watch novilty movie. Every time you watch this movie something else will be noticed that went unseen before. I highly reccomend this movie for its witty jokes and high rewatch value."
3,"A good movie, great music, and a great cast.","I personally dislike Clooney, but he's a great actor and he accels at these types of movies. Turturro and the rest of the cast are fantastic, and reading about the parallels to Homer's Odyssey is interesting."
2,Great movie; Bad Blu-Ray,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. However, the Blu-Ray version has serious problems. It will play in an older Sony Blu-Ray player, but it won't play in my newer Sony Blu-Ray player. After over an hour on the phone with tech support at Sony, I learned that many new Blu-Ray discs are having problems and they cannot keep up with the firmware upgrades. Since Sony is one of the originators of the Blu-Ray format, I am obviously disappointed. They said that only if enough customers call in with the same problem will they commit the time to make their player work with a disc based on their technology. Before purchasing a newer release on Blu-Ray I would recommend verifying that the manufacturer of your Blu-Ray player has already verified compatibility."
3,A Fun Movie,"This is a good way to spend an afternoon with the kids. If I had kids, that's what I would do.I love all the actors and actresses in this work, but I think this is the movie that turned me into a George Clooney Fan.I've owned this for a few years now and I still blow the dust off it and play it from time to time.A good lighthearted story."
5,good movie,"It is worth watching a second time. I really should read Homer again, just to search for the different references."
4,Great Fun!,"O Brother Where Art Thou? starts off with a song that will have you crying tears of laughter. And it doesn't let up from there. Every time we watch it it only gets better, reminiscent of ""Let It Ride"" with Richard Dreyfuss. This could be George Clooney's best role ever. If you like ""sleepers"" that have you rolling on the floor, then this is it! (By the way, 4 1/2 stars to O Brother to Let It Ride's 5 stars)"
5,Sheer Genius!!!,"This film weaves together a story line that stands on its own as a brilliant work of absurd humor with a richly textured subtext of references to the Odyssey, Sturges' Sullivan's Travels, Moby Dick.... The film works even if you don't get all (or any) of the references, and the performances are delightful. I never knew I was in desperate need of seeing John Turturro yodel until I did! The only flaw is that they don't let Charles Durning dance enough. See this movie --- it's smart, funny, and beautifully filmed, and the music is a fascinating slice of the old South."
1,"MIGHT JUST HAVE WELL BEEN ""GOPHER WHERE ART THOU""","in this film the crustations play the brombones and are the main actors. Their acting in the scene about the liver/meatloaf pate is damaging to all life forms other than the rare speccies of over grown grub larva, mainly the mammoth grub larva GRUBINICO GUTSERICHITY"
1,It can't get worse,"Plain and simple bad, this movie could not keep my attention at all although Clooney is ok but thats it."
1,Oh Brother!!,"This flick was, overall, disappointing. Contained too few funny parts and was, many times, slow moving."
1,Movie,"This ia an excellent movie, but the disc is scratched and skips a segment of the movie. I ordered from this particular seller because the ratings were high and the movie was described as being in very good condition. I am, however, disappointed."
2,Boring and rarely funny,"Gotta tell ya, this SHOULD have been a great movie, all of the ingredients were top shelf, it just didn't jell. Thankfully someone lent me their copy (to save me the $22) and told me that they hated it, boy were they right. It wasn't funny very often, it was slow, it was boring, and worst of all at the end I was sitting wondering what the hell the point of the whole thing was, dumb!Rent this one if you must subject yourself to it, it is NOT worth owning unless you or your uncle were in it and just want to show friends that you were in a movie with Clooney."
2,Oh Brother Where Art Though?,"Packaged well - arrived quickly.Husband loves this movie and had watched it on a VCR tape numerous times, so I purchased it in DVD format for him. I found the hillbilly music and humour not to my liking."
3,What a Paradox!,"First of all, the movie deserves 3-1/2 stars. This movie might be the highest example of having the potential to be one of the greatest films ever made, but falling short of the mark. The movie is one of the best: acted, filmed and soundtracked I have ever seen; HOWEVER, the screenplay is sometimes confusing as well as paced rather poorly throughtout the film. It is definitely entertaining, but I would rent it once before buying it."
4,A feast for eyes and ears,"A truly superb movie. Funny, memorable, and a feast for the eyes and ears (the soundtrack CD is a definite keeper as well). Clooney carried the movie wonderfully, and his two sidekicks were remarkable as well."
2,My mistake,"A friend told me the movie sound track was excellent. Without thinking I ordered this DVD and when I received it realized it was in fact the movie, not just the music. I don't watch movies."
1,A Total Snooze-Fest (Zero stars if I could),"Too awful for mere words. Dull, boring, unfunny, confused, slow... Did I mention dull and boring? Arguably the worst movie I've seen in years. Loved 'Fargo' and '...Arizona', so I'm certainly not anti-Coens.I'd love to write some more, but I'm still trying to wake up from the near coma this movie put me into!"
3,"Homer, I hardly knew ye","To say Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? is loosely based on Homer's Odyssey is to say the Kentucky Derby is loosely related to the chariot scene in Ben Hur. It's Odysseus, for Cripes sake, not Ulysseus (that's the Roman name for Homer's hero).... There are more allusions to Le Morte D'Arthur than the Odyssey....ie. the 3 in search of the unattainable--just as Galahad, Percival, and Bors searched for the Holy Grail. Here's the key--a movie that is truly based on a myth doesn't have to advertise itself as such."
5,Great Movie,My family and I just love this movie. I don't know why we didn't have it in our collection already! This is one we love to watch over and over.
4,oh brother where art thou,This was a great movie good actors and wonderful music my family truely enjoyed it.
1,I couldn't do it.,"I know that it is suppose to be fiction, but it is SO far fetched and historically inaccurate that it was absolutely torturous. I was unable to get to the end."
4,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!,"I'm sick and tired of all the negative reviews for this film. So it didn't follow the book 100%. But it had some top quality acting, great action pieces, and awesome visual effects. Buy it and watch it. And please, don't diss it! Grade: A-"
1,Read the book,"The book by Clive Cussler is fantastic. Get the book, don't mess with this terrible flick."
3,What a waste of talent.,"I am a white female who is into all kinds of music and I found Snoop and 2Pac, both to be very talented people. I felt that reading this book would help me understand the lifestyles of a gangsta rapper. I am afraid all I found was a complete waste of life and talent. Death Row Records was appropriately named. All involved seemed to have encountered death at some time. It's really a shame that people these days are so quick to pick up a gun and use it without regard for human life. Hind sight is indeed 20/20. Nothing will bring Tupac or Biggie Smalls back and still the guns and drugs are out there every day, stealing away the great talents from our world. People wake up. Death isn't the answer to Life, it is only the end of an era."
1,Crap-smanship,"You've got to be kidding me! I come from KC and a family of BBQ ""specialists""...I've owned several offset smokers in this price range. (we move a lot to a lot of places) This is by far the worst I've had. the firebox is two pieces and has lots of gaps for air to sneak in, the door doesn't fit right, the stack is way too close to the lid when it's open, there were bad welds that didn't even hold through construction. I could have done better with the materials and a welder myself. I'm taking this back tomorrow."
3,matt dillon kicks ass,"i am a fan of matt dillon(drugstore cowboy, over the edge, the flamingo kid and albino alligator just to name a few) I also liked this film. It's got suspense, its got action and mystery. There are some holes in the movie. Gene Hackman kicked in this movie a major punch as Dillon's father/ex CIA agent. They have to find out who kidnapped his wife and so they go to Paris, where Hackman used to work, but left a long time ago and Dillon is just learning about the hidden past of his father. People try to kill him. In the end its very good and its really pleasing. I enjoyed it"
5,Stat,"I found this book very useful, not just for people in health professions or women. Lots of useful information and real-life examples. The best book on assertiveness I've read."
5,An amazing new talent,"What an awesome song and a simply awesome talent. It reminds me of the days when music was fun and just simply enjoyable. It is a refreshing change from the ""Back that thang up"" and the ""You Make Me Crazy"" songs that are on our airways today. Radio, pick this one up! It is SLAMMING!"
3,Substantially outdated,"Prospective readers should note that this is not a new book. Rather, it's a repackaged reprint of one of Bernstein's earliest books (circa 1965). Fed Chairman Emeritus Paul Volcker has written a shiny new introduction and Bernstein himself takes a few pages at the beginning to place his old ideas in historical context, but frankly the meat of the book is totally outdated. There is perhaps no area in economics that has seen more change over the past 40 years than monetary policy. Bernstein wrote this book before the demise of the gold standard, before stagflation, before the modern consensus on monetary policy. If you want to read Bernstein on gold, a much more contemporary treatment is presented inThe Power of Gold: The History of an Obsession(A caveat: I have not read that book yet, but include it only so the reader can be aware that there is an alternative.)"
5,A wonder,"Sparse and fascinating. The lyrics of the aptly named opening song conjures up images of boys, frogs, fiddles, and cornfields under open skies. The album flows seamlessly from track to track until climaxing in the beautiful Handsome Family cover, ""Don't Be Scared."" This isn't Bowl of Fire, though Kevin O'Donnel and Nora O'Connor lend their talents. Nor is it folk, rock, pop or anything else you've heard before. The etherial blend of violin, whistle, glockenspiel and vocals is otherworldly, baroque (yet distinctly midwestern, to my ear - a musical Fargo). Turn the lights low, the stereo up, and allow yourself to be absorbed into Bird's strange little world."
1,awful,"This product was awful. The bars have a grainy hard texture. I thought maybe they were old, but they don't expire for a couple years. Maybe they have been stored improperly? I don't know how anyone could like these. I much prefer Yamate sugar free chocolate bars. I am not affiliated in any way with Yamate - just a fan. I'll go back to order their bars."
1,Wrong movie,I ordered the original 1967 Doctor Dolittle starring Rex Harrison and when the movie arrived this afternoon the case was from the original movie but when I put in the movie to watch it I found that it was the newer Doctor Dolittle with Eddie Murphy..
2,Lost story.,"I had forgotten how boring Rex Harrison was. It didn't take long to remember why I didn't remember much about this movie. Harrison's performance demonstrates how muddled and off key the ""songs"" are and the miscasting of the actors. This is a movie for the under 6 year olds. The remake with Eddie Murphy is so much better being a comedy and no musical numbers."
3,Yuck,"I bought this soup because they stopped selling Dr Mcdougalls. This stuff is gross, and there's 35% MORE of it. I think the soup is so bad because the dried onions and carrots are raw.Not a good idea. In order to make this soup palatable, I put three ""mini moos"" in it after it's softened up enough. I eat this for lunch at work, and thank god I'm almost through the pack.One positive is that the soup IS nutritious and full of fiber."
4,Replacement Cartridge DC-51 will fit Sunbeam model 702,"I have Sunbeam model 702, the nursery humidifier that looks like a fish tank. This Sunbeam cartridge has been discontinued and I believe it's being substituted with the Kaz DC-51. A previous reviewer states it does not fit Sunbeam model 701. I can't speak to that, however it does fit model 702!"
1,region was incorrect,this dvd would not play on my nor anyone i knew dvd player. it would however play on the computer. It ssays on the screen that it is a regional era. Dont know what that means but feel a bit unsatisfied that i cant watch this movie with friends unless its on computer.
5,Glad to own!,"I love this movie because of Michelle Pfieffer and Rutgur Haur first of all. They work very welll together and make this movie realistic. Also, I love movies set in this time period where magic abounds. This is one of the most tragically romantic movies I have ever seen.There is also humor that blends well with the more serious aspects. In these type of movies I love that ""love"" wins over the ""evil sorsorer and the lovers have been avenged. I don't normally believe in revenge, per se, but in a movie such as this it is expected. It is heartwarming that the lovers are reunited in the end, I have watched this movie a million times on television when it is available and I am as enthralled each time as if it were the first time viewing,. It,s great I have it now to watch anytime I want! Thank-you,Cherie (Cheryl)"
5,Great Movie,"This was a great movie, it has romance, action/adventure, betrayal and love, and of course, Matthew Broderick's smart mouth. The scenes with Rutger and Michelle were tear jerkers. I think they did a great job with the casting."
1,EU format,The video was evidently recorded in an European format that is not compatible with most US DVD/BLURAY players so I haven't been able to view th movie yet but I have researched the problem & think I may be able to reset my BLURAY player to accept all formats - just haven't gotten around to trying it yet. Would have been good to have a warning on the selling site that the DVD wasn't compatible with US players.
2,Fantastical let down,"Unlike many, I hadn't seen this film when it first came out. So it was with much anticipation that I recently sat down to watch it. Well, it stunk. What a disappointment. The only really good thing in there is Leo McKern, who shines forth like a beacon in a fog of wooden acting and stilted dialogue. Show 'em how it's done, Leo.Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful to look at, but her role is limited. Matthew Broderick is clearly inexperienced this early in his career, and delivers his lines without any panache whatsoever, which hampers the film, since his character is supposed to be a quick-witted thief. Fortunately, he has come a long way as an actor since then. Rutger Hauer is just plain bad.In defense of the director and crew, the film is prettily shot (with the exception of the poorly choreographed climactic fight scene) in well lit, scenic locations.Otherwise, I would not recommend this film to anyone with expectations."
4,A classic with one glaring flaw...,"All this film needs is a new god damn soundtrack and it will be an all time classic. I don't know what kind of smack Richard Donner was smoking when he sat down and watched the film with that god awful 80's rock track and said ""I love it!"". They should just scrap the soundtrack and hire James Horner to come in and do a new one. But then again, James Horner has been mailing them in of late as well. How about Thomas Newman? He's always one for pulling the heart strings. If you can forgive the weird noise that this film insists is its musical score, buy the film and watch it. You're gonna love it."
5,A Missed Gem,"I've watched this movie twice so far and I'm ready again. It's a hidden gem. Not high action, excellent story, excellent acting. This movie is good from beginning to end. Basically, Bronson is hunted by Lee Marvin and a posse- won't say more. Watch it. It's an oldie but goodie!"
3,Old School Pro Wrestling Themes,"This is a collection of old school 90s pro wrestling entrance themes from WWF and WCW stars from back in the day. Highlights are: N.W.O., Goldust, Undertaker, Dude Love and Stone Cold. It's not bad."
3,SLAMMIN WRESTLING HITS IS A HIT!,"THIS IS A GREAT CD FOR WRESTLING FANS, BUT I REALLY LIKE THE DIFFERENT VERSION OF STONE COLD'S MUSIC ON THIS CD! IT HAS ALOT OF BEAT TO IT AND IT REMINDS ME OF HIS OLD THEME. IF YOUR A STONE COLD FAN LIKE ME, GET THIS CD, AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
1,biased,"The book is nostalgic and to some extent like a fairy tale. Christopher Hitchens, as always, is inflexible and bent upon forcing his opinion on the reader. Hopefully, Christopher can do better in future."
5,3M-8115 Fiberglass to Metal for sure,"I researched the product & found it to be right for the application.Bonding fiberglass lower 1/4's to the existing good steel.I am a body work rookie but was just concerned with bonding the 1/4's not finishing.This product worked GREAT!.Easy to apply (with a rather expensive mixing gun).Easy to work. You have time to spread over seams & fine tune the application.Easy to clean up (I used lacquer thinner with no problem).Recommended to anyone looking to do the same.This week, I'm trying it on a gauge pod bonding to the existing A pillar.."
4,Frau Blucher (listen intently),"Nobody does it better. . . nope not ever. A combo of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein this is a long, fun, black and white bonanza for crazy one liners and site gags. Nothing beats the breakfast scene when they discuss the monsters dimensions. ""He will have an enormous. . . It goes without saying."" Anyway, five stars is not enough for the fun this movie can provide. One suggestion, watch the two Frankenstein movies mentioned above before seeing this one. It is a great ride and well worth the purchase price."
3,Young Frankenstein,Great movie for watching at home with the family and friends. Very funny in a campy sorta way.
4,Video was grainy,"Im not sure what the point in purchasing a blu ray edition of a great film such as this when the film is very grainy. I can probably purchase this on regular dvd and have the same effect. There is no point in purchasing this poor transfer in blue ray, i get a better picture on downloadable video."
5,His Best,My favorite Mel Brooks' film. I gave it to a 15 year old who also loves it. I think it's a good idea to acquaint a younger generation with the classics from the past.
5,The Best Horror Movie Spoof Ever,"I don't think there's any way this movie could be improved - the actors, the sets, the dialogue - all fantastic. There are so many ""gems"" in this film: Frau Blücher (""He vass ... my boyfriend!!""), ""Puttin' On the Ritz"" dance routine, everything Madeline Kahn says and does, Peter Boyle's monster, Gene Wilder's comedic genius. There is nothing since that can compare to it."
4,Great flick,Hilarious movie; lots of good laughs. Great comedy to add to a blu-ray collection. Gene Wilder is phenomenal in this.
5,great movie,Love Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle. I bought this movie for my grandson. He kept saying he was going to get this but couldn't find it anywhere. I told him go to Amazon he can find anything that he needs.
4,Fun movie for Halloween,This is the first Mel Brooks/Gene Wilder movie I ever watched all the way through. It is a great spoof of the orginial monster movies of the 40s/50s. It takes every stereotype and turns it on it's head. A descent into madness is more like a wild romp in the woods. I recommend this movie if you need a laugh. It is great Halloween season movie.
4,What's the big deal?,"Okay, so the movie was sorta funny, I guess. So what? I can't believe some people actually think this movie is the funniest movie made. That's just a wee bit of an overstatement. Even though the movie got 4 stars, I don't think it deserved it. There were a couple funny parts (Do you want any wine? No. Milk? No. Ovaltine? Nothing!) but overall I think Mel Brooks ... out when he did this show. The Producers, for instance, is a lot funnier. But hey, don't take my word for it."
5,Great product!,"Great Product!! Shipped fast, description of item was perfect, everything wrapped & new. And its a great movie too :) Thank you!"
3,Fine for the most part but a few of the disks wouldn't work,2-3 of the disks in the pack gave me error messages when I tried to burn to them from iTunes. Not sure why but they had to go in the trash.
3,Shady!,"They sent me the wrong color too. Interestingly, the picture has been removed from the website."
2,Ok for a few months,"I had this mouse twice, and I noticed after 3-4 months of use the scroll seems to not function anymore. Besides that, it is a ok mouse."
2,One Drawback,"This mouse feels good in a way that others don't - there is support at the base of the thumb and less ""pinching"" pressure is required to move the mouse. Also, the shape itself helps to keep the elbow closer to the body reducing pressure on arm and shoulder. For the first few hours of use I thought the solution to pain in my hand and thumb had been found.Then the palm of my hand began to tingle and it continued to intensify. The feeling is a hightened version of how your hand feels if you put it in the microwave oven too soon after opening the door, except the tingling doesn't stop. This may not bother most users; but for the small percentage of people who can ""feel"" the microwave or fluorescent lights or even a cell phone at your ear after prolonged use, this mouse may carry a significant drawback.Such a pity I had to return it."
2,Less than perfect clicking,"Nice shape, but in the first week I've experienced bad clicks. That is, I gently click the ""left click"", and I hear the mouse make a ""click"", I feel the gentle click, but the mouse does NOT send a click to the computer.I much prefer MS intellimouse explorer, both with or without tilt wheel. The latest Intellipoint software 5.2 has great custom button asssignment like previous intellipoint software."
2,Looks good but useless for me.,"I had big expectations on this purchase but turned out to be big disappointment. I am using KVM switch and manage two computers. When I connected it to my switch it was detected fine but once the software was installed I lost the curser. Updated driver set did helped neither. I never used the software but I assume without it you can't program the bottons therefore device turns out to be a useless 4 botton mouse. I had explorer mouse, this is piece of j...k compare with optical explorer."
4,VERY IMPRESSIVE!!,"The Brides were not as funky as you would think their title suggested, but they could hold their own. They were actually more conservative in their funk, but still very soulful. The two ladies did get the job done!!! I gave this four stars because their studio recordings were a little more funkier than the live recording."
1,ITEM-NOT-FUNCTIONAL,"Upon trying to play the ""PIANO"" allegedly Blu-Ray disc, it would not load on a brand-new, functional Blu-Ray player.I am very disappointed. The person who I gave it to as a gift is having her ""techy"" boyfriend check it out to see if it is salvagable by making a copy for now.I would actually like a new copy.Thanks,Vera Scholl"
3,An okay movie,"I have seen this movie a few times over the years, but it is not a movie that really grabs my attention or makes me want to watch again. I liked the unusual love story between Baines and Ada, but found the story of the movie odd. Everything about the movie is pretty dull."
2,"Shallow characters, bizarre story","That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating!On a positive note, Michael Nyman's score is unbelievable. I love it."
1,Ugly,"this is one of the ugliest movies I have ever viewed., Nothing of beauty in it whatsoever. I found no enjoyment in watching it at all. I felt there must have been a lot of anger in the person who wrote & directed it. Maybe I am wrong. Reviewers have given this movie equal status with the movie The Pianist, but I find that ludicrous. This movie in my estimation in no way is the equal of The Pianist, which is a superlatively exceptional movie. The Piano plumbs the depths of ugliness IMHO."
2,"Wonderful film, terrible Blu-Ray","I adore this movie and picked up this Blu-Ray the week it came out. It is a huge disappointment, though, seeing as somebody really screwed up and left off the subtitles. So in the scenes where Ada signs, or when the Maori people speak, there is no way to tell what they are saying unless, like me, you pretty much have the dialogue memorized. Even so, I returned this Blu-Ray and am holding on to my DVD version."
2,Doesn't add up,"A very impressive performance by Holly Hunter, some gorgeous cinematography, and lots of excellent costumes, can't make up for the fact that the script is unbearably pretentious, and extremely implausible. Art house fare can frequently make for some very compelling movies. ""The Piano,"" however, is NOT one of them."
5,Love and romance with class,"This is an excellenct movie for adults. It is a love story with tons of romance, beautiful scenery, and the story behind the movie is a great one. If you want to be entertained and surprised at many different levels this is the movie to watch."
1,OUT OF TUNE,"You try. You try again. You try a third time. Finally, you simply throw up your hands, turn it off, and flip over to a ""Law and Order"" rerun. I""m aware of the film's reputation, its awards etc. I just simply cannot ""get into it"". I realize that my entire career is riding on a positive review. But, at least I realize now what Henry Clay said about 170 years ago: ""I'd rather be right than President"". Or, Clayton Moore to Jay Silverheels in 1949: ""You ride into town for supplies,Tonto, while I make camp""."
4,I don't get it!!!,"I don't see how anyone could say this movie was original. Don't get me wrong, I loved it but it is Cinderella 100%"
1,attention ladies!,"If you would like to commit adultery, you need ART!See, without it, you're just another adulterous floozy! But if you're an artist (singer, dancer, painter, musician, etc.), your adultery rises to heights of spiritual poetry!"
5,A compelling film masterpiece.,"Anything with Harvey Keitel is worth watching. He fills the screen, but here he outdoes himself. This was the first Holly Hunter film which caught my attention and since watching it I have looked for others. All three principals put in magnificent performances. Jane Campion's direction captures the mood perfectly. Worth a second, third and fourth look."
2,Seems like they haven't learned,"Just read previous reviews after purchasing 12 of these. I purchased mine at Home Depot under the Vigoro product name. Seems like the same problem they had with these sprinklers 2+ years ago is the same problem I am having. Used the sprinklers about 5 times and 3 of them have stopped oscillating. It's a shame, because they work great with my well water system. Tried a few other types of sprinklers and this one was by far the best. My suggestion is keep your receipt. It seems like only a matter of time before they are gonna quit on you."
1,Poor product,"I really liked the idea of this sprinkler and I really liked it for the short time it worked. Unfortunately, the first one I bought worked well for about a month and then quit oscillating and the spray pattern could not be adjusted. I returned it to Home Depot and replaced with another of the same. It worked about 6 weeks and then had the same problem. I returned it for another type and noticed that the bin where there had been 10-20 of these was entirely empty so apparently they had had lots of returns and discontinued the line."
1,HAUNTED HEIRESS - a pretentious work,"Although the HAUNTED HEIRESS attempts to instill in the reader the notion that Daphne du Maurier's works do not fall into the ""romance"" genre, she fails to convenience the reader of this. Even drawing comparisons to du Maurier's grandfather and contrasts to the great Bronts, all is lost in her attempt to move Daphne du Maurier out of this shallow genre and into one of a more academically acceptable category. Her supportive arguments are grotesquely silly and oftentimes clouded by an awkward, pompous writing style."
4,easy-to-read summary of recent US foreign policy,"Easy to read, very interesting book about US foreign policy since World War II, with focus on each president's ""doctrine"" and how it manifested in the various wars, pseudo-ward, foreign relations, etc. Recommended to anyone with an interest in recent politics and/or history"
1,Very disappointing,"I've been fortunate to have recently read several very good books about 20th-Century history. This isn't one of them. There's nothing particularly good about the entire book, but it takes a decided turn for the worse in the chapters that discuss the Clinton and GW Bush years. Before that point it appears to have been written on about a 12th-grade reading level. In the Clinton and Bush chapters at the end, however, it reads as if it's actually been written by a 12th-grader, and not one that deserves a high grade in a language-arts class.More specifically, toward the end of the book the author regularly repeats his thoughts, and sometimes even contradicts his own points within a couple sentences. I'm not quite finished with the book, and right now the only thing keeping me reading is to marvel at the poorly constructed sentences and paragraphs. I'm actually morbidly fascinated with the idea that a well-known professor of history signed his name to this mess."
4,I used this for background information for a history class.,"We used this as supplementary information for a history class. It has great information that I wasn't exposed to previously. What is annoying is that this probably could have been packaged better. It has the Northwest and Southwest on the same disc. I would have put the East coast on one disc and the West coast, and Alaska, on the other. Never mind that it could have probably had all episodes on one disc. If the make a blueray version I hope it's all on one disc."
5,awesome!,This is a great film. I was pleasantly surprised that it arrived so quick and the quality was so good.
3,"Muppets and Broadway, I'm so there","This is another movie that I loved growing up - well, I loved all of the Muppet's movies. PLUS it has Lonny Price in it, who I find oddly attractive (now, that is, not so much back then). And for some reason, all of the rats' lines have stuck in my head (""Come on in, the coffee's fine!"") without my realizing it - it was only on watching this movie again that I realized where the lines had come from."
5,The Muppets Take Manhattan.,"I am not fan of musicals but I love the Muppets,this is a fun movie for the whole family no matter what age. I grew up on this and I love it!I like Kermit and Fozzie the most."
5,Brubaker - A super movie,"I've seen this movie at least 5 times and every time I seem to enjoy it more and more. Robert Redford is superb as warden Brubaker, a new warden sent in undercover to see all the corruption that has been going on at Wakefield Prison. Yaphet Kotto does a great acting job in this as well, and a very young David Keith (An Officer and a Gentleman fame)has a bit part. I certainly recommend this movie. I can't wait until it arrives on the DVD format"
2,Disappointing...,"I was ready to love this book - and I didn't. I found the story to be bland and the characters uninteresting. She feels the need to tie up all of their problems in a tidy bow at the end of the book which bothered me a lot. The answer to all their problems was all too simple. If you are looking for a good read, keep looking."
2,Disappointed,"I picked up this book after finishing her Pulitzer Prize winning novel, The Stone Diaries, which I thouroughly enjoyed. I, too found it a bit boring, but mostly I just found the character a bit pathetic. She writes numerous letters (all unmailed) castigating various authors for not including any women in their articles on great authors, thinkers etc. I consider myself a feminist, not a radical, mind you, just an average middle-aged woman who owns her own business and has taken charge of her life. The attitude was so defeatest, that her daughter is so defeated by this male dominated society that she checks out of it. It seemed a bit ridiculous and almost insulting to women. Although I felt for her, I could not relate to the main character's turmoil at all. She just seemed so weak and resigned to her daughter's fate."
2,okay,"This books is about a depressed middle aged woman, i can sympathize with the character but it does not make for a good read, who wants to read a book about the boring thoughts and mundane life of a unhappy middle aged woman? Maybe its because i'm a young male and i cant relate to her, but im thinking noone wants to read such lifeless prose.edit:i was a bit harsh on the prior review... of course there are pros to the book, one of them is that it is very easily readable, a decent reader can fly through these pages with ease, and although it may not be an exciting life ur looking at, at least its a different viewpoint"
2,Cop Out,"The book is slow and thought-provoking, but with an erratic insertion of feminist resignation (""Oh, woe is us, we aren't appreciated! If someone came into our coffee shop with a sword intent on killing us, I guess we'd just have to let him do it, because we're so helpless! We wouldn't even try to fight back. Why bother?"") kept throwing me out of the book and making me angry with the author. I could not see any reason why, if Norah had been a boy, he would have been any less likely to be on the street with a sign around his neck."
3,Mother & Daughter adjustment problems,"Shields beautifully lays out the dilemma of parents whose offspring totally reject the expected paths and drop out. They embrace a circle of society foreign to their family. This mother, herself a writer of sorts, manipulates, bargains and grieves what she perceives as the loss of her daughter. She grieves and obsesses to the point I lost interest and didn't finish the book."
1,Secularism gone amok = mush,"Take a person who prides herself on having sex with her 'partner' on their first date, having three children with no marriage, treating her mother-in-law like a boarder at meals, and wondering why her children, particularly the oldest, Nora, has no structure to her life. She's so lost trying to find herself that she had to drop out and live the life of a derelict. This is what happens when children continue searching in vain for what their parents can not give them. . . possibly what they were not given by their parents. It results in mush: mushy story about mushy decisions and mushy results. Oh, they get in the claims for feminism so to satisfy the liberal readers but otherwise, it's just many, many, many words, very little emotion and no rationale whatsoever except that maturity doesn't result from living in the vacuous world provided by theseextreme secularists."
1,disappointment,nothing like quality of previous ant farms from uncle milton. hard to instill liquid. clear plastic viewing area scratches very easily. replacement accessories are way too expensive.
4,Science Fair Project,"The ant farm wasn't as big as I had imagined but it was good enough as Uncle Milton's shipment of one ant colony consisted of only about 10-15 ants. As for the price, it was a bit on the pricey side. I would not recommend it to small children as the pieces tend to come off quite easily. As for older kids, it may or may not be a fun thing to do as watching ants can be beat by the television any day, nowadays."
2,"Tells Part, Not All, of the Story","Ledeen's writing reveals the flaws that all Straussians have: The failure to understand the fundamental causes. They understand the superficial causes but not the fundamental ones.Ledeen is no different than the PNACers who are running our foreign policy these days. They all are simply incapapble of getting it, so they are all incapable of offering a way to fix it, too. Terrorism is a social, economic, and political issue with security consequences. Addressing one dimension of one of the causes (political) with the simplistic and ineffective notion of regime change is farcical. Address all three or stay at home."
4,Great Movie,"I think this movie was great, not from the quality of acting and the writing, but by the genius ways they showed two different decades. The eighties are presented in an over the top, spirited set of individuals, which co mingles with a more cautious and controlled pop culture of the 90''s and 00's. Even the music reflects the common stereotype that each decade represented. This alone really is good enough to outweigh the cheesy writing (which only promotes the stereotypes,) method acting, fairy tale ending, and simplistic message."
4,Much better than expected,Classic hero's quest movie cast in a new light. Better than expected. Some great cameos too. Should appeal to fans of This Is Spinal Tap and Almost Famous.
3,Great film - appalling Blu-Ray transfer!!,"I have this on the great Criterion original dvd, and decided that the Blu-Ray version would be worth the upgrade. This was a BIG mistake. The film is five stars, and the transfer is one. Sorry Criterion, but you have really screwed up on this one (as you also did on the terrible transfer for The Last Emperor). I am a huge fan of Criterion releases, but this was appalling. The film was as blurry as my original dvd from a few years ago. I tried both to compare, and trust me, there is hardly anything to choose between them. My wife who does not care too much for all the superb definition that Blu-Ray can provide, was just as shocked as I was when the film started. I have a 58 in Panasonic Plasma, with Panasonic player, and I was just so let down by this. I will sell this and keep my original dvd. What a shame!"
2,Wonderful perfomance; poor sound and vision quality,This is a wonderful perfomance of this opera. Philips has presented on VHS in the '90s and I think it was never offered on DVD. But this version seems as if it was a copy from the VHS. The image and sound are not first class. I hope Euroarts or some other label could present this perfomance as it deserves! So far It's the only way to get this great perfomance.
4,A courageous film,"Selma (Bjork) is a simple-minded young mother who works herself mercilessly in order to save money to pay for a medical procedure that will save her son from the same medical condition that is claiming her own eyesight. This film depicts the many pitfalls she encounters as she attempts to accomplish her goal. Director Lars von Trier has made a remarkable film that makes use of some interesting oppositions. The plot is pure melodrama, yet it is filmed in the ultra-naturalistic Dogma style. The story is relentlessly depressing, yet it is a musical set in America--and which film genre is more inherently optimistic than the American musical? These elements, along with a heartbreaking performance by Bjork, make for a fascinating viewing experience. I am sure, however, that there will be many who are unsatisfied with the simplistic plotting and annoyed by the shaky hand-held camerawork."
4,A grate movie,This movie did have a lot of corky points. But Bjork is corkey and I like her CDs and her in general mainly because of her corkeyness. And since she was in this movie I wanted to get it and I was plesintly suprised i suggest that you rent this movie. This is a must see.
5,Just Great!!!,"Don't think about it, you have to see it, i really cry in the last 10 minutes in the cinema, and when i left the movie theatre i have to run to the store to get the DVD and the Soundtrak (which is not the same of the movie). The DVD is great, the selection of Selma's Songs in the special features are really special, it let you go to the song ""I've seen it all"" in few seconds, and, specialy, i never enjoy the documentals of a movie like i enjoy this, is lovely see Björk when the musicals are ensambled, i realy love this DVD, and i am in love of the movie, don't think about it, you have to see it!!!"
2,NOT a Musical,"Excellent acting, but one of the most depressing films ever made. It is not, repeat NOT, a musical and should not be listed in this category!"
1,rent this 1 before buying,"You will either believe this to be the best or worst movie you have ever seen. I am a Bjork fan. I love her music. I even believe that she is an adequate actress. However....she was in (in my opinion) an impossible to watch movie. The ""groundbreaking"" camera work was intolerable, the sound bad, the lighting poor, the storie contrived, the acting weak, the ending disturbing.I give this one 1 star, only because I like Bjork."
5,Dark Dancer,"Björk is powerful in Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark. It's very clear why she says she'll never act again. As she became her role - a very disturbing role - I can understand how she sufferred for her art. Dancer is an excellent film about a mother's love for her son. As Selma goes slowly goes blind - she uses the last days of sight to save enough to get her son an operation to avoid the same fate. Although the music is beautiful and haunting - it adds to the misery of the characters. This is a difficult and disturbing film to watch, but it is extraordinary nonetheless. The DVD edition has a beautiful image and excellent sound. It could have only been better with a commentary that included Björk."
5,My favorite movie of 2000!,"This movie is just brilliant! It made me mad, it made me cry, it made me think. The music is also a nice touch. Buy this movie now. You will not be disapointed at all."
5,A very real film,"Well, I thought this film was incredible. I saw it for the first time in Sweden, while I was a little out of my element and maybe a bit more emotionally vulnerable. Nevertheless, I highly recommend watching this. But beware, because the emotion that you feel is so real and raw, like you are experiencing this first hand with Selma. Second, because it deals with a situation that has happened in real life before (the frustration and desperation, the hopelessness, and fear, and also the hope that is brought forth through the musical scenes. I have to admit that to watch this you had better be prepared to cry for two hours straight. Be sure to have kleenex and maybe a few bottles of good beer ready! This film will change you."
1,Daddies and the Mommies who love them,"This is a great read for men who can handle the truth.If you have the guts to read how we are lead around by our nether ""parts"", have little to no self-control, cannot wipe our own [rears], and then complain when someone does it for us..... this is the book for you. heheheheh"
4,"Falta una Bien gorda ""Solo para ti""","El disco esta bien pero falta una bien gorda""Solo para ti"" que se podria haber metido en vez de la version reggae de ""Bailar pegados""."
5,"Awesome product, awesome results",My husband uses this product routinely with weight training with amazing results. This product delivers as promised. This is also an awesome price!
1,$10.00 wasted,"I bought this knife from the home depot for around $10.00 after I lost my Winchester folding knife. At first glance it seemed like a steal now, less than a full month of minor usage, it looks like I was the one taken to the bank.The most minor problem is the rubber inserts came off after just about a week. Now I'm noticing that the blade is rubbing against the inside liner and getting dull quickly because of that. Also,the blade has come loose several times and had to be tightened.The good points are that it was cheap enough to just keep on the side as a back-up if need be. It did come sharp right out of the box, did keep an edge fairly well and is easy to sharpen.The Winchester I lost was just a couple dollars more but it did last alot longer, I had it for about 5 years and would still be using it if I hadn't lost it. I would recommend looking around, there are knives with better overall quality priced competitively with this one."
3,Good Phone- Not with Cingular Though,"Just A week ago I switched From Verizon to Cingular because I wasn't getting good reception, and cingular is suposed to have ""More Bars in More Places"". It turns out I couldn't get Analog signals with my old phone. I'm back with Verizon now with the Treo 650, and I have had it for a month and I have never had under 3 bars. Though when I had this phone with Cingular there reception Sucked. When I went on a trip from spokane to seattle I had 6 dropped calls out of about 8 calls. With Verizon, I did the same trip later and had only 1 dropped call out of about 12. So overall the phone is good but Don't get cingular."
4,"Cingular Service is great, but the phone...well....","I have had the Treo 650 for quite some time, and if the following were changed, I could live with it...1) Volume, can't live with it being this low and crappy. I have a 3rd party program on here to try and fix the issue and it is no help. 3 different bluetooth headsets, no help either.2) Stability, this thing does a reset for literally no reason other than it wants to.If/when the 700p or the rumored Hollywood makes it's debut on GSM, then I might consider it, otherwise I might switch to a blackberry 8700c, but paying 44.99 for the blackberry data plan is highway robbery vs the 19.99 I play for the unlimited media plan, and it is the same thing...I will say this, if you are thinking about getting a Treo, it is a crap shoot on whether you are getting a stable phone. It is a great device that allows you to have everything in one place: phone, contacts, data, email, etc...however the platform stability is horrible...Good luck if you buy one..."
2,Not a good phone,"I have owned this phone for about four months now. The signal quality is poor. I have to strain to hear. The calls drop out regularly. Often after a couple of rings the phone stops ringing. I am quite seriously unhappy with this phone. Now here is the really awful part, there is no easy way to dial someone from the contact list. No easy way to scroll and dial. The dial button is often not available on the contacts. Basically the Palm part is not integrated with the phone, they are two separate devices."
3,Don't even think about trying to play music-,The Real Player included with the 650 for playing MP3 is a joke. Plan on spending the next few weeks trying to download music and get it to play. Then go out an buy an iPod
1,Don't Support Palm Vaporware,"All the extra PDA features this phone provides are nice. The only problem is that it is not a phone.A phone will ring when someone calls you, not reboot.A phone will not go into voice mail immediately and not notify the user.You don't have to place a phone on speakerphone in order to hear what the other person is saying.When making a call, a cellphone will not crash 50% of the time.For some reason the reciever on this phone will decide when it does or doesn't actually want to work.Who cares whether or not your phone can play movies, if it can't even make a proper call. Palm promised a patch to fix all these issues, which took them 6 monthes, and still there is no change. This will be the last Palm product I buy. The cost alone is the only reason I haven't taken a hammer to it."
2,Save your money for a better one,"The Treo 650 is useful as a PDA, but as a phone the sound is terrible. People on the other end of the line are constantly being asked by me to repeat themselves. I use it with Verizon service, and I know it is not the service because my other smaller regular phone works well, and previous phones with the same number worked well. Buy yourself a separate PDA and phone, because Palm has not perfected this one. The phone sound is a garbled mess. I sync the PDA with Outlook and constantly run into duplication problems because I sync it with 3 different computers."
1,PALM TREO IS A DISASTER,"Obviously, some of the positive comments have been left by sales reps - don't be fooled as I was - this phone is a disaster. I've had it for 30 days and already these issues:Issues:Earpiece on phone does not work at all.... Can only hear with headsetVoice does not work on headset at timesRinger no longer worksCannot place a call without powering down first.... Calls go out, screen says dialing and then freezes - person on the other end of phone can hear me - I can not hear themThis all began happening over the past week - gradually and I just did not have time to bring the stupid thing back. Never dropped the phone, misused it, nothing.If you have the time to waste on problems and feel like gambling on this one - go for it.... but there is a class action suit on the treo 600 & 650 for similar reasons. Palm messed up on these phone REAL BAD!"
1,CHOP DOWN THE TREO. DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE,"I got a Cingular Treo 650 a couple weeks ago. The call quality is reminscent of the early 90s...remember your Motorola brick phone? Feedback, dropped calls, and now device-initiated soft resets.The call log does not track to contacts.No voice dial (pay extra)No voice memo (pay extra)No Palm service - Cingular only. I made 4 calls today and got - you guessed it - four different answers to the same question.This device is not ready for prime time."
1,Waste of Money ( if you want to make a phone call ) !!,"I have to say, I feel stupid for paying so much for a terrible phone. I wanted a smartphone to use when traveling. I thought the treo 650 was going to be what I was looking for. Yes, you can get an internet connection - No, you can't get good reception when using it for phone calls. The only time my calls don't get cut off is in the car when it is connected to Bluetooth. I have had it for only 4 months and am considering going back to a regular Nokia phone. I have always had good luck with those."
5,Sony Blank Media,"Not one coaster; not one. That goes for both CD-R and DVD-R and I have burned over a thousand of both. Almost all of both are made in Taiwan, but the Sony brand quality persists. The only comparable brand is the more expensive Taiyo Yuden, which I also use. I use the Sonic RecordNow Plus software."
2,Poor Quality in Car Stereo,"I typically burn songs from iTunes on to a CD to listen to in the car. I found that these CD-R discs will playback in my car stereo (Pioneer AVIC-U310BT), but the songs sound SO quiet! Usually the volume on my car stereo is between 20 & 30...but with these CDs, I have to turn it up to 60+ to hear the song, and even with it turned up, the quality sounds very poor (treble and bass both sound awful...almost monotone). I tried reburning the CD's at various speeds with no luck...the quality is just as poor. I checked the owner's manual for my pioneer stereo, and sure enough, it lists CD-R's as being compatible...I guess something with the Sony discs my stereo doesn't like. I have previously used a different brand (Maxell) of CD-R's and had no problems...I just wish I had realized that before I bought 100 of them."
1,really really bad,I purchased this item and had it sent just in time for my trip to florida. Unfortunatley. Now im stuck $5 short and with a scratched dvd that doesn't work.
3,There was Big Trouble before Crouching Tiger,"Since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon achieved such acclaim, people might like to also watch this little gem from the 1980s. It features martial arts action, with a bit of ""wire work,"" and a pretty good story involving Chinese mythology set in modern times.What I'd like to comment on the most, though, is the quality of the DVD. I originally had this on a store-bought VHS, pan and scan. The quality was so low that - even though I enjoyed the film - I questioned spending the money on the DVD. I'm glad that I did, though.The DVD print is crystal clear. The special effects come across *very* well and seamlessly blend with the live action much better than they did in the old VHS. Plus, with the widescreen, the action is less cramped and makes more sense.Don't be fooled by the poor quality of previous VHS cuts of this movie. The DVD looks and sounds terrific - like a totally new film!"
3,"5 stars for the movie, 3 stars for the dvd","Beware if this term ""ENHANCED WIDESCREEN""! you know what does it mean? it means that, this movie is not originally avaibale in widescreen format. we (studio)want to fool you with your widescreen TV! we put black bars at the top and bottom of the full screen version and at the price of sacrificing some large parts of the picture, bringing you an ENHANCED WIDESCREEN version! congratulations! I think widescreen is not that important! maybe some people do not want to be fool by the trick of widescreen! please release 2 disc special edition in full screen as soon as possible and replace your defected product!this is exactly what universal studio did for the owners of back to the future widescrren, so its possible!"
4,We are Jack inside,"Jack is the main charactor. Truck driving, beer drinking, loner with a positive id. I can watch this movie over and over. I'm glad it's out in DVD. Some may think it's stupid, but it's fun, a movie you can watch with your kids with interesting plot. It gets into Chinese belief of the elements. It is a movie I can watch several times a year with a big bowl of pop corn. The internet can give you more insite into the Chinese charactors."
4,"A Great, Quirky but Fun Flick!!!","Big Trouble in Little China is what a Popcorn movie should be. Lot's of action but at the same time lot's of laugh's as well. John Carpenter has thrown in some key, funny moments that really keep the film going smoothly. And Kurt Russel is at his best as the non-typical hero who keeps dropping his weapons and getting his butt kicked, but his fast ""reflexes"" are what keeps him alive it seems. Some good creepy scenes from fright-master Carptenter, but not too much gore to keep the younger viewers from watching! The sound and video transfer are both great, didn't see anything distracting at all! Great Flick!"
5,A silly love story with a great asian flavor,"""Big trouble in Little China"" is a comedy that takes all of the worst of the 1970's asian kung-fu fighting movies, adds a little ""Chinese black magic"" and a whole lot of humor. Its a great movie and the unedited version is much better"
1,"Here I am, watching it for the third time, and I'm asking myself ""Why?""","Well, I don't understand why I don't appreciate this movie like the majority of these positive reviews seem to reflect. Even though it has had a larger budget than John Carpenter's ""Escape From New York"", I still prefer ""Escape From New York"" as the better, more stimulating, satisfying midday matinee entertainment film from the legendary John Carpenter.What I am missing here? The way I see it, this movie is still, to my mind, so relentlessly uninteresting. Pointless and silly, if anything."
4,Great Fun,This movie is great fun! It is non-stop action with a good enough plot they don't need all the blood and gore to keep things moving.
4,Good Stuff!,"I like this coffee quite a bit. I did notice that the packages that I got from Amazon seemed to be a little flat compared to the ones I got directly from JavaOne. They weren't popped, but they had very little air in them. That might mean that they're not as fresh, but they still taste great. I'll order them from amazon again next time."
2,Why this kind of a rating?,"I bought this lightsaber right after the movie came out. I was so disappointed with this lightsaber. I hate the fact that the blade doesn't retract all the way, which makes it looks weird when you aren't using it. The blade was bent after my first ""battle"". The light up blade didn't light up after my first try with the lightsaber. It looks kinda cool when the blade is out, but how you can't swing properly with the huge switch there on the handle. It looks real and it is Anakin's lightsaber until the end, where his lightsaber is taken away, but come on, make the lightsaber a bit more durable?"
5,This thing is awesome,This is the best lightsaber yet. I've played with the old lightsabers and even the not so old ones [ darth mauls ] and they were [not so good]. They bent and broke but these are totally dfferent. The hilts look just like the movie and the blades are strong. The blade dosent just close when you due with a friend it stays in place. I recomend this for all star wars fans. ...
4,Light Saber Blade problem,I own all the episode two Light Sabers And I would give them 4 stars because when you Duel with them Silver Paint gets on it.
5,Hopping Freight Trains in America,"This book is Amazing! If your thinking about this lifestyle no book can compare! The information is endless. There is a certain allure of hopping a train, i hope to someday experience this great wonder. It is a dying art no doubt and this book keeps the spirit alive!"
1,"what, now your ready to ride??????","there aint no book anyone can write that can explain how-to train hop.it gives young punks a feeling that they will be safe if they follow the rules.bull.i been out here on the rails for 20 years and i couldnt have learned any of it from a book.theres aready too many stupid kids out there who think they know it all.hell, some a them ride to protest.train ridin is tough.it`s for people who dont like people.that are dirt poor.ride to live.live to ride.lets keep it that way brother.if your gonna ride.get out there and do it.dont read no book."
3,Respect or ridicule?,"This might have been the best book written about country music in 1970, but back then we were used to having people ridicule country music. The author overuses words such as whiny and corny, and he seems to be poking fun at the fans and performers he talks about.Much of this book comes across as frozen in time, and I enjoyed that aspect of it--before Opryland, before Dolly Parton's fame, before Stringbean's murder. The chapter about traveling with Bill Anderson was especially good. The chapter about Glen Campbell, although I'm not one of his fans, fit well into the context of the book. (I watched his show regularly.) The book brings back good memories.The chapters about Tate City and Billy Dilworth, however, had nothing to do with the Nashville Sound. There was SO much that could have gone into this book, so many people to talk about, instead of the apparent ridicule and the twice-told story of Bob Dylan."
4,WELL DONE WORK - NOT FOR THE VERY YOUNG,"I liked this work, but must agree with another reviewer there, this work probably would not be suitable for ages four and five. The illustrations are great, well executed and interesting. The text is quite precise and historically quite accurate. The text did match the illustrations. As I said though, kindergarten and first graders probably would loose interest in this one. I did read it to the third and forth graders though and they did enjoy it. The only other criticism I may have is that I did not feel it addressed the extreme hardships these men went through. On the other hand, I was well able to correct this through discussion. Overall recommend."
5,Faint at heart; beware,"Atwood quite enjoys probing the intracasies of the female psyche. In this novel she truly captures the essence of a woman at her most vunerable. Atwood again holds to her favorite relationships between sex, politics and desperation. As the main character attempts to regain her footing in reality she slowly gets thrown into a deeper state of confusion from her new surroundings which she scarcely understands. Atwood is a intense writter who requires a mature audience, she doesn't waste a word and it is easy to get lost in her stories."
4,Binds X to Y,"I bought this to glue some leather to metal, which is a hard task for most adhesives. 6 months later through snow and sun it's still holding. Good job, Goop."
3,Amazingly slow shipping,"The wallet itself is great. It's even better than what my husband had hoped for in a wallet. However, even though I ordered it a month before Christmas, it didn't arrive until well after the holidays. Yes, I received a phone two weeks after I placed my order telling me that the wallet wouldn't arrive until Dec. 24. We were out of town for Christmas so at that point it didn't even matter. What mattered was that it didn't arrive on Dec. 24 but a week and a half later.So while I'd rate the wallet 5 stars, shipping and customer service earned this purchase a 1, averaging a 3."
4,Political Strategies,"Dick Morris Fox television network political analyst and former Clinton advisor identifies six strategies used by politicians throughout history. Morris presents twenty case studies--from Lincoln's Civil War tactics to Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign--assessing successes and failures in each. Includes commentary on the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the U.S. government's response. A must read book for all aspiring politicians."
1,Scum,Why help this jerk earn a cent from his pandering. The only thing Dick Morris believes in is himself. He's the ultimate example of why Americans hate politics.
5,NARUTO: Shikamaru keychain,"Top favorite Naruto character, Shikamaru is just too cool especially if you have the key chain. The product is excellent and it would last for a long time. Check it out if your an anime fan."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE - won't fit your oven,"Length:: 0:55 MinsIT DOESN'T FIT IN A NORMAL OVEN!The ""Easy Grip"" handles may be easy to grip and all, but they make the pan too large to fit in a normal size (GE Monogram - ought to be a pretty standard size) oven.What kind of morons are these Cuisinart people? They never tried to put their nice new pan into an actual oven?I'm not inclined to trust any more of their products based on lack of thought this one shows."
5,Great Blue-rock and Hard Rock from one of the giants of 60's rock,"A very good sample of Janis Joplin and her amazing melodic combinations and blues rock. These are some of Joplin's best known and best loved works.Some of my personal favourites include the charismatic blues Piece Of My Heart , the breezy Summertime , the contemplative Try (Just A Little Bit Harder), the hard rock Down On Me and Ball and Chain and the folk-style Me and Bobby McGee . Janis Joplin played an important role in the evolution of rock."
2,Don't Buy This CD,"If you really want to get a taste of Janis, feel her soul and passion, don't start here. This CD reflects Janis's music about as much as ""Skeletons from the Closet"" reflects the Grateful Dead's music. Do yourself a favor and start with ""Pearl"" or ""Dem' ol' Kozmic Blues."" I won't go as far as to say that this CD is no good, but your money is better spent somewhere else."
3,Not what's advertised,"It's good for what is is, but it isn't what the description says. It has only 10 songs. The 2 bonus tracks aren't on it. I bought it so I could have ""Mercedes Benz."" It's not there. I didn't lose much money, but it was a let-down."
1,poor recording quality,This CD skipped and generally had poor recording quality. I returned it. Have not yet received credit. The songs were good as near as I could tell.
5,Great complement to the series,"I have all three workouts in this series and adore them, though I admit, Yogini did have to grow on me. Ellen starts out easy and simple, but before you know it you're doing a lot of downward dogs into plank pushups over and over and sweating like crazy. While this is yoga-based, it still incorporates Ellen's signature moves of second position plies, side lunges and more, along with some fierce chair squats and other strength moves. No equipment required! I am alternating this with her other two Studio workouts and am loving the results! And maybe I'm in the minority, but I love the music. It's slightly eerie, reminding me of a dark, rainy October day."
4,"""Old School""","For someone who was a teen in the seventies, this book will be a nostalgic trip. The author's use of musical and movie references, street lingo, and fashion helped him to paint a fairly accurate description of 1976 DC. The violence may be a little over the top for some, but if you enjoyed Shaft, Superfly, Trouble Man or Pulp Fiction, you'll enjoy this book. I plan to read more titles written by this author."
1,Terrible book!,"This was my first book by this author, and I don't think I want to read another. I like the genre of ""hard-boiled"" detective novels, but Pelecanos obviously thinks ""scummy"" means the same. There's not one likable character in the book, nor is there a believable one. A small potatoes dope dealer and a record store owner who pride themselves on knowing the bass player for Funkadelic do not compelling protagonists make. A real bummer and a chore to read. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
1,getting tiresome,"So I decide to give Pelecanos a second chance after the narcoleptic Down By The River... and what do I get? A sawbuck poorer and a couple hours off my life that I'll never see again. And the music cues just keep on coming long after we're dead tired of hearing them (hot tip: just mix a greatest hits cd and release that instead). Slightly more hardboiled than a Phyllis Richman culinary mystery, only with people getting shot in the head. But hey, it must be good because he uses actual street names, right? Gimme a break! Never again."
4,"fast paced, funny, and brutal","Pelecanos' books are generally set in Washington D.C., and King Suckerman is no exception. The title refers to a movie which is debuting soon in the area theatres, to a lot of street-level buzz.The characters aren't glamorous, but they're really memorable. Description is one of the author's strong suits, but that doesn't get in the way of an exciting, riveting plot.Pelecanos' books are my favorites among crime and mystery authors working today; he really captures the sense of Washington D.C. (this book is set during the 1970's), and the characters are true to form.If you like your fiction hard-boiled, give Pelecanos a try. I wouldn't start with this one. Start with A FIRING OFFENSE.If you've read some of the earlier ones, like Nick's Trip or A Firing Offense, try the Suckerman.ken32"
1,Not worth your time or money.,Not good. Metal is cheap and the tang might as well be a rat tail. I took the planks of to look at the tang right after i took it out of the box. Barely anything down there. Don't give this thing a second glance
4,It's a sword,I was looking for a small easy to carry sword for a B.O.B. This fit the bill. Fairly strong blade & sharp. I would have liked a better grip on it. The weave mesh it has moves a bit when you use it. I will probably change that out. Overall can't beat it for the price.
3,The Unsinkable Barbra Streisand,"Steisand can bury any costar she shares a screen with and leave them in the scenery. Walter Matthau, unfortunately, is no exception. All told, Dolly is a steamroller in this production, directed with a perhaps too-gentle hand by Gene Kelly (of ""Singin' In The Rain"" fame). Interesting bits to watch for: a VERY young Michael Crawford, and an airplane flying across the background in the midst of a HUGE production number."
4,SURPRISINGLY GOOD!,"I'm a Streisand fan, but I think that Carol Channing would have been better as Dolly. However, Barbra is surprisingly good. If you forget that she is too young for the role, you will be impressed by her brilliantly funny performance. Her duet with the great Louis Armstrong is fabulous! The scene where she's feeding Walter Matthau beets is a scream. A really good movie! (I've seen Channing on stage-she is the perfect Dolly-5 stars!)"
4,Gold digging was never had such a nice tune.,"This movie is about a meddlesome gold digger (barbara streisand) who plans on tricking a wealthy store owner to marry her. seems bad, well it probably is, but in the process she helps to lovers get married, 2 meek store clerks fall in love, and even finds herself falling in love with her target.the actors are quite enjoyable, and uplifting with their mood. the songs are catchy, and well preformed, which makes watching this even more enjoyable.i would say this would have to be one of the best musicals made.basically if whoever is reading this can get over barbara's nasally singing voice, and like musicals, then by all mean buy this."
1,"Great film, bad DVD.","Great, splashy eye candy film, and yes Streisand is too young. But we must forgive that. What I don't forgive is the poor transfer of the video and audio. I know this since I have a working 12 inch laser disc player with a 32 inch Sony tube TV. The laser disk is superb. The image is very crisp and the sound is dazzling. The DVD images are blurry, especially at the beginning of ""Parade"". The sound is compressed and the crispness is gone. I ran them side by side and the differences are not subtle, but huge. If this DVD is all there is right now, we are stuck with it. The experience can be so much more thrilling. Let's get this gem re-remastered, or better yet, put on Blu-Ray! The three big Streisand musicals are being neglected, but the 2006 DVD of on ""A Clear Day"" is good, only because what came before was so bad. Let's hope Blu-Ray will fix them all."
3,The good doctor is back.,"This fun follow-up to the first Phibes film tries hard and is entertaining, but doesn't measure up to the wit of the original. What made the first so compelling was its atmospheric cinematography, set-dressing, costumes, clever wit, and overall mood, ranging from the creepy to the hilarious to the exotic. Nevertheless this sequel is a fun outing, with some memorable moments. These were made by the same director who did the original Avengers series."
4,Not the original ending.,"This DVD does not have the original music that ended the film. They removed it and put a track of Price singing ""Over the Rainbow"".(The song used at the end of the first film.)It even says on the back of the DVD(in the trivia section)how Price recorded OTR for the end of the film but the filmmakers decided not to use it. Well it seems that the distributors of this DVD decided to put it into the movie. That's a shame because the music that was originally used really fit the ending of the film. The 4 star rating is for the original film, not this flawed version."
4,great!!!,"the sequel to ""phibes""!!! kitsch, great movie !!!!the sets are amazing, and the deaths memorable!!! a lot of british humor!!! for everyone!!!!"
4,Wait...Don't buy it yet!!!,"Picture quality is excellent. It's a great product for video chatting with friends/families across the country if they owned one. Now I can see what my friends really look like. The only problem is that they are too cheap to get this webcam. You can invite friends to video chat only in the Xbox dashboard not within the games like Halo2. Totemball is a horrible game and not even close to PS2 Eye Toy games. AS of now, my camera is sitting on top of the TV collecting dust."
4,Good find!,"I am very thankful that someone digs up these works supressed by the regimes. There is much valid and exciting music in the series ""Entartete Musik"" from London. The symphony here might not be musically what the Krenek from the same series is, but one cannot deny that this was a composer of some talent in the genre. Its orchestra is very large and well used. After only one listen, I am convinced that Rathaus was able to bring melody into his neo-romantic symphony, which is full of dissonances (at least for 1922) but never approaches atonality. To me, the symphony outshines the ballet, but that could also be a statement borne from a personal bias towards a sometimes too ""Hanslick"" view of music(I apologize if that offends). Both are admirably played and the sound is good as well. While this disc is going to appeal chiefly to the connosieur, it should undoubtedly do so at that."
2,Magnet is too weak,Looked like a great idea but the magnet is too weak to support anything heavier than a piece of paper.
4,It's Coming Out on a Region 1 DVD but Only In a Mel Brooks DVD Collection Right Now!,"Silent Movie is a hilarious comedy movie. It is coming out on DVD sometime in April 2006 but at this point there are no seprate DVD releases and you have to buy it in the Mel Brooks boxset collection which also includes Robin Hood Men in Tights, High Anxiety, The Twelve Chairs, To Be or Not to Be, Young Frankenstein and The History of the World Part 1. Right now this is the only way to get Robin Hood Men in Tights on a region 1 DVD but I am sure that eventually they will release it seperately."
3,Almost Great but Not Quite,"This is a celebrated novel by literary critics and publishers, but be fore-warned. This is not a historical novel about the Pearl Harbor attack or about the world events that led up to that attack. The author writes a number of beautifully drawn passages, but they are far outnumbered by tedious and superfluous descriptions (and ramblings). The author will always write 50 words where he would be better served by 20 succinct ones. It is hard to believe that the legendary editor, Max Perkins, worked with Mr. Jones on this novel becuase it represents one of his few lapses of editorial judgment--this work should have been chopped in two. But the work will endure and I suppose that it deserves to be on many lists for renowned American novels---but it is long-winded and discursive."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED!,Says ALL METAL but the one I received is GREY PLASTIC! The faucet section is PLASTIC not metal. RIPOFF! False advertising!
3,This is the first English product like this I've ever tried!,"It must be said that I recieved this quite a bit sooner than expected. I did kinda like it....some of the ladies said they did! Not harsh to the skin, acually the scent is very mild, too. I would recomend this to friendsI must say after much thought that I didn't appreciate the seller e-mailing me suggesting what I should put in my review."
1,Good while it lasted,"Suited my needs for reasonable coffee and milk steamer for about 8 months. Cheapie knob for switching from coffee to steamer is a bugger. Steam is now leaking inside somewhere in steamer mode causing serious heating of the top of the unit, nasty noises, and fear of explosion. I descale it every month so I don't think I mistreated it. Did get daily use and was only $[...] but I think it should still last more than 8 months."
1,Hostas new plant library,It will be hard to review this book because you could not deliver this product to me. I find it hard to believe that you would ask for a review.
1,Don't believe the hype.,"My wife being from Europe,is really into foot care,so I thought I'd buy her one.Save your money!!She hates it!! The revolutions are simply not high enough to get rid of callouses.It's probably fine for fingernails,but not for stubborn foot callouses.It is not worth the money."
2,"This device works, but is NOT heavy duty.","I previously had the Medicool TurboFile II device but it broke down so I decided to purchase this one as a replacement. The device does work, but it is nowhere near as powerful as the Medicool device. For harder nails, the increased friction from applying increased pressure easily (and constantly) stops the head from spinning; it simply does not possess the high torque of other devices. I would recommend this product only for light tasks."
2,Not powerful enough.,Did not have the proper attachments for a pedicure. Lost charge quickly. IO had to do pedicure/manicure in stages while waiting for the tool to recharge-definitely inferior to Dremel.
4,"Nice study, but no answers!","A nice study, but keep in mind that this is exactly what it is - a study. It has questions that you, the student get to answer and the ""correct"" answers are not included in the book! I actually purchased it to serve as source material for a class I am taking at bible college and this did not do what I hoped it would (but that is my fault, nobody else's!)"
4,Great overview of historical positions; weak pneumatology,"Grenz helped me tremendously by tracking the history of several theological positions such as trinitarian doctrine, atonement, etc. Given Grenz's education, the trek through history should come as no surprise, and a few of the ideas of his mentor, Wolfhart Pannenberg, leaked fittingly into the work. Grenz was devout in relating every aspect of his theology to the concept of community. Unfortunately, his presentation of the Holy Spirit was a bit impersonal (love bond between the Father and Son). This book is certainly worthwhile for seminary students or laypeople wanting to delve into systematic theology. The book serves as a great beginning to further study or a sufficient summary of popular theological positions in the past and present. However, if you are a teacher, please do not follow in the footsteps of my professor by giving a test with 50 True/False questions over the entire book (859 pages)!"
3,Lauren Bacall !,"Based on the classic movie ""All About Eve"", Lauren Bacall won a Tony for her performance in this great musical.Best tracks include:But AliveApplause [Bonnie Franklin of ""One Day At A Time"" fame!]Something GreaterNot all the songs are great, but totally worth the buy!"
2,Not worth the C batteries I put inside it,"My child was very excited to try out the Dora bubble machine and so I set it up outside and left my child to have fun with it. After a few minutes, I realized the poor design of the bubble machine.PROS:- Popular Dora and Boots characters- Kids love bubbles- Fairly inexpensiveCONS:- Works for only a few minutes at a timeA few minutes in, it stopped blowing bubbles. The problem I found is that the bubble reservoir is too deep for the bubble wand (Boots' tail) to reach all the way down. After a few minutes of bubbles, you have to top off the reservoir. A waste of bubbles and time. After a few repetitions, my child got bored, as did I. We have tried to use it a couple of more times since, to try and get some use out of it but it was the same story each time. It also happens to be very loud. It is in the dumpster now. We are back to manually blowing bubbles, which really is more fun anyways."
5,Funny movie a good collection,I enjoyed this movie very much and good if your needing a laugh.I saw this movie when it first came out and absolutely loved it. Comedies are a favorite and it also gets some good points across.
2,Fair,"The overall DVD is fair...it's not really any different than the VHS version except for a few extras. The extras aren't really that good anyway. The movie itself is entertaining...but the movie is pretty stupid and doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I was surprised that so many curse words were used in this film...way too many. The usage of bad words is so prevalent that it becomes irritating after a while. Seriously, I would not want my kids to watch this film because after hearing the same curse word about 50 times...they are bound to start saying it. I was displeased at the number of bad words used...and they should definitely have used less. Overall movie is okay...not great though. Not really worth the price. The plot of the movie is rather dumb and I thought several parts were very inappropriate to view."
3,"Sort of Funny, but....","Funny in spots, but a little over the top and the rating is lower than it would have been if not for Jane Fonda, the traitor, being in it."
4,9 to 5: Works over time for laughs!,"Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman) is the boss everyone loves to hate (move over JR you got some stiff competition of the most hated boss of the 80's). A series of misunderstandings leads him to think that three of his employees are really trying to kill him. When he tries to use this to his advantage, they turn the tables on him and threaten to expose him for the sexist, egotisitical, lying, hypocritical bigot that he really is. He gets all tied up (literally) while trying to prove them wrong and the race is on: Can he cover his tracks while they turn the workplace into an ideal working atmosphere much to their boss's disgust? This movie is Dolly Parton's first movie and you will recognize her voice as she sings the title song. She holds her own in the laugh department. The DVD contains some extras like deleted scenes and an interview with the cast on how 9 to 5 was created and the surprising public response to Dolly's first movie."
4,"it kept me jumpin, but that dont mean nothin","it was a great movie, with a great plot, but it was presented poorly, it wasnt interiesting, it kept repeating itself yet overall, it was great go figure"
4,Gold(berg)en Classic,"This film is super! A computer operator in a bank gets drawn into a cloak and dagger situation when she meets Jack on her computer at work. He needs her help but it could take all she has to help him get home again... and MORE! Whoopie fans should not miss adding this one to his/her collection. Whoopie is SO talented and brilliant! I would love to see her doing more films again. If you have not seen this one, boy are you missing out!"
1,very unhappy,"When I ordered this DVD, I chose the one that had a picture describing it. After receiving it, it turned out to be a region 2 DVD which will not work for me. I was told a replacement wasn't possible; I returned item. I find it difficult to believe there are no region 1 versions that could have been sent. I have returned the item and have, as yet, received either a possible replacement or a refund."
3,"Movie's a stretch, but ya gotta love Whoopi","Whoopi Goldberg is one of those people who could make me laugh just reading the phone book. I always enjoy watching her no matter what she's up to.So, I definitely got a kick out of Jumpin' Jack Flash, even though the storyline is pretty unbelievable and the romantic element kind of tacked on perfunctorily. There are a bunch of fun bits that keep the movie entertaining, but the story line is really just something to hang Whoopi's immense talent upon. Fun but flawed."
4,Classic Whoopi,This has always been one of my favorites and my grandchildren had never seen it. They totally enjoyed her antics.
4,Fabulous story for those who are 'different',"As a child drawn towards Shakespeare, Witchcraft and other esoteric fare in the rural South in the 1960's, I had a rough time of it. I can still remember the exquisite surprise of finding this book in the school library. Here was a little girl who knew what it was like to be different - and to be a witch. The charming storyline has stuck with me for more than 30 years, and I'm happy that I can now share it with my little girl.The ending was, as I recall, a tad disappointing, but it did not detract from the overall story.Treat your children or yourself to this one - you'll be glad you did."
3,APPRENTICE WITCH,"Well, the title implies a cast of thousands, but the story really revolves around the intense relationship between two fifth grade girls, Jennifer and Elizabeth, the narrator. Black Jennifer is a loner character, while white Elizabeth is an impressionable only child, new to the neighborhood. The other folks mentioned in the prolonged title (remember The Mixed-Up Files....) don't really count as characters. Elementary girls will enjoy this cute Halloween read. END"
2,Still causes problems.,I have IBS and this product irritates me. Went to Chelated Magnesium by the same company and I get along fine
5,"""Great Freakin' Movie""","I would definitely have 2 say, i expected alot less from this film, but I'm glad i did... It was ""GREAT"", very gorey & lots of action! I may have dozed off for a couple of minutes, but when i think of it... I was drunk outta my mind & it had to be at least 4 in the morning!! ENJOY!!!LMAO>:D"
2,Beware all Scalpels & Turbine Blades!,"""Bad Dreams"" is a story that is so horribly bad that is only great for a Friday nite when nothing else is on cable! Each character is quite irksome that you love to see them get bumped-off by madman Harris (Richard Lynch)! The horrendous parking lot hit-&-run scene between two rival doctors at the mental hospital is totally laughable because it's just so darn ludicrous! Also, Dean Cameron's character having a scalpel-happy, self-mutilation episode is just plain sicko (yikes!)"
3,At least they did not sing much,"Imagine your high school decides to put on a play written, directed and starring fellow students. And, we are ready for the camera.Fakey hillbilly talk and and really naive characters flourish.But, the color, focus, and sound on the DVD are more than adequate. Not the sort of thing you are going to wish to watch again and again, but it is still an entertaining performance by a Hollywood legend. And...the singing is kept to a minimum."
3,Don Murray or Jom Carrey?,"The other reviews cover the plot pretty well so I won't say anything about that. I've never seen a movie starring Don Murray and as I watched this one, I kept thinking it was Jim Carrey on the screen because of the outrageous way both of them behave. Did anyone else sense this connection? I think Murray did a pretty nice job because he sure annoyed me!"
1,Brin totally loses it!,"I think I've read every book David Brin has written, and ALL of them are better than this one. He seems to have totally forgotten how to tell a story. The book starts with about 250 pages of tedious character development. When we finally get to a plot, it rambles all over the place pointlessly. And it has absolutely the worst, lamest ending to any book of any sort I've ever read. I can't believe I read the whole wretched thing.Brin is trying to explore how a society of clones would really function. That sociological exploration is actually quite well done, even if it is done over and over and over and over. And over. And then, just in case we missed the point, he ends the book with a patronizing afterword telling us what we should have understood from the book. In summary: a strong candidate for worst major science fiction novel of the 1990s. Yecch!"
2,Take Note,"THIS VOLUME IS ABRIDGED. It says in the introduction that it is only 2/3 of the original. I have not read the work, but I'm going to wait until I don't have some editor telling me what I don't need to know! I'll go to Gibbon himself for that!she who is no longer the Angel of Music"
5,A masterful abridgment of a masterpiece,"This is a mastefully done abridgment of a great masterpience. Hadas chooses the most readable and interesting sections of the great work. Gibbon is a writer of such majestic eloquence and such insightful generalization that reading his work gives a sense of the sublime. Unfortunately however the subject, and much of what he relates including even the story of the magnificently successful period of the Empire at its height under the Antonines is far less than sublime. Cruelty folly sadistic passion human self-indulgence at its worst are on strong display in these pages. No wonder Gibbon thought of History as the record of the follies, and misfortunes of mankind."
3,Great Comedy from Masters of Terror,"Karlof, Price and Lorre, the unbeatable trio of mild and humorous horror flics, deliver a performance with a cheesy but comedic atmosphere. Somewhere between ""This Island Earth"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" lies this tale of transformation and wizardry, designed for gruesome laughs and light entertainment."
2,A New Wave prog recording,"After reading such great reviews about this recording, I was shocked when actually listened to it.It is basically an 80's new wave recording with experimentation and changing of tempos.Much better than Nomozo (excuse the spelling) and Are you Sitting Comfortably, which were bland radio airplay sellouts.It is like other prog acts of that era like Asia, Kansas, Yes that were forced to become radio friendly, or lose the recording contract.Thank goodness recording technology improved to make quality recordings and much less $$$$$, so bands could put out the music they wanted to like IQ brillant Ever cd"
1,"Nice idea, good price, useless item","It would be great if this splitter cable really let you input to two monitors at the same time - but it doesn't. As soon as you plug the second device in, one or both flicker or display nothing.Also, the female connectors have thumbscrews - and since the male end of monitor cables also have thumbscrews, it's an obvious mismatch. Duh?!"
2,1M/2F MONITOR SPLITTER,"The splitter causes my computer monitor to shadow. I havn't determined the cause, however I believe it has to do with the cable not being properly shielded. The projector, that is also hooked up to the same cable shows no signs of shadowing. It got the job done just not well."
3,"get ""3 games to glory II"" instead","Although this is a good DVD review of the season, I would say to anyone to get the 3 games to glory II DVD instead as exactly the same material is on this DVD but with 3 games to glory II you get an additional DVD with a further 150 minutes of stuff. I bought this first and wish I hadn't bothered now. Get 3 games to glory instead pats fans!!!"
4,very intense,"this movie really left me shocked. No wonder it's considered a classic! After the extremely disturbing 'exploding stomach' scene, I almost wanted to stop watching. But I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. At the end, it left me so tense, I almost fainted. Although this movie doesn't contain any deep sci-fi messages (it's no 2001), as a suspense film, it worked remarkably well for me. It was one of the most suspenseful films I've seen in a long time!"
4,A Psychosexual Gothic Masterpiece,"Filled with emptiness, pregnant with malignancy, it amazes me still how Walter Hill mutilated and rebuilt a relatively innocuous space exploration chiller into a psychosexual gothic masterpiece. Some of Scott's best direction, too; much less involved than some later films."
1,What an awful movie,"It borrows a lot of story elements from Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and the effects work are sickening to the stomach.I don't care if some people liked this movie, it represented a low turning point in science fiction."
5,The start of the best horror series ever!,This movie was awsome but it would have been better if their were more aliens. But I still give Ridly Scott a 5 of 5.
5,The Scariest Alien Film Ever Made!,"Good grief this movie was tense! It was also awesome. I am of the opinion that this film was scarier than its sequel. It is extremely well done.If you are brave and have a strong stomach, see this one!"
5,A landmark in movie making.,First things first.Aliens destroys this one.Ok I'm done.It's actually kind of unfair to compare the two. The directors take such a different approach to the films.Alien is a piece of movie history.Brilliant from start to finish.Masterfully acted and directed.Superbly paced.One of the many movies you simply can not miss and should probably own by now.Highly recommended.
4,Otimo!!!!!!!!,Otimo filme com uma bela edio! A Imagem parece um cinema. Luva impecavel o unico pesar e o estojo mais fino ecologico.
4,Great mix of science fiction and horror,The first 45 minutes or so of Ridley Scott's sci-fi classic are actually pretty boring. The usual great visuals from Scott appear but there is not a whole lot to the story. Until an alien gets planted inside a crew member of a spaceship and pops out of his stomach. Then there is an alien on board that feeds off of man. Some great suspense and horror follows also keeping things intelligent too. It's very good overall and the excitement of the film's second half is truly worth it.
2,"Boring from the beginning, but fear began around the ending","This movie was very, very boring at the beginning, since this was the very first ""Alien"" movie. But what happened to the girl with the short hair? She just vanished, and how come when there is an ""Alien"" movie that has only 1 alien, it takes like more than 5 people to kill one, but when there's like 20 aliens, people could kill 1 alien easily just by shooting them. And is biting their victims with their second-mini mouth the only way the aliens can kill? And we never get to see how the guy that was climbing down the ladder? What happened to him? And can the new-born baby really be full grown in just few hours? But still I liked the ending, but how did the alien to get in the small ship that the last survivor was in? This movie wasn't that scary, and had many un-explained things in it too."
4,very good deal,This was the greatest deal I found around! My husband and I watched all of them in a weekend! We loved the extras!
4,Seminal,"Not normally a sci-fi fan, therefore unfamiliar with the tropes, styles, set pieces, ideas and special effects that would set more of a context and burn the film deeply in my cinematic consciousness, I could nevertheless appreciate this movie as a seminal sci-fi classic. Tension is built up, layer by layer. The concept of an outside, mysterious force entering an enclosed and isolated space is explored subtly and realistically. It watches very well, nearly thirty years after its release."
5,Alien,"'Alien"" is one of my favorite films. Although I do like the entire series of 'Alien' movies, this is my favorite. The film itself is well directed and includes an awesome cast. Sigourney Weaver is one of the best actresses ever, in my opinion, and the other members of the cast are simply spot on. The story line isn't mucked up with irrelevant material, but instead, is very clean, clear and engaging. It seems that every screen writer believes they must throw nudity, sexually explicit material and the excessive use of foul language into a film to get an audience. Not in this one."
3,666: The curse of Damien Thorn!,"I was weary of watching these 'Omen' films as I thought the would be dull. But to my surprise I enjoyed this sequel. Plenty of gore and plot and starring the ol' horror and sci-fi veteran Lance Henriksen. As sequels go its pretty good. Poor old Damien, everyone he cares about either goes mad or ends up dead. Check it out..."
3,"I know it is only fiction, but it is the BEST of the 3.","Damien! You little Devil. This one tells all while leaving you wanting more, even though that is for Theologists and Historians to debate. It was entertaining and gives you a real value for the lack of accuracy in the story itself..."
3,Frightening,"The story continues were the first Omen ended... Damian is now a teen and learns who he really is, understands his place in the world, uses his evil strength to those that will harm him and begins his quest to be a powerful leader, setting the stage for the third installment of Omen III: ""The Final Conflict."""
2,slow in the going with random deaths placed throughout,"The original was so good, too. The set-up of this movie was creepy, and there was some definite potential. However, the parent characters in this film aren't nearly as engaging as Peck and Remick, and Billie Whitelaw's evil nanny was one of the key elements of the original that made it so scary. I think that the film was further hurt by how it first made the viewer sympathize with Damien, and then let him indulge himself in unnecessary dispatchment of random characters. I wanted to feel sorry for him and then he starts to like taking people out! What is the deal? And of course, no one can be convinced of his true identity until they see this wall, which gets tedious. Very unsatisfying, worth two stars only because everyone does decent performances (except for that Mike Brady-looking guy) and a few tense scenes (the woman and the bird and the icy lake)."
4,They Grow Up So Fast!...,"Little Damien Thorn (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) turns 13yo in this overwrought, yet enjoyable follow-up to the classic original. Damien is now in the care of his aunt and uncle, played by Lee Grant (Visiting Hours, The Mafu Cage) and William Holden (Towering Inferno, Network). Damien is now a military academy cadet, watched over by the eeevil sgt. Neff, played by Lance Henriksen (Aliens, Pumpkinhead, Near Dark, Face The Evil) until his true destiny is revealed. Of Course, there are the usual goody-goody types who try to stop our favorite devilchild from reaching his full potential, but they are easily dispatched by an obligatory series of fatal ""accidents"". I especially liked the death-by-train-car and crow-attack sequences! D:O2 is a gloriously cheezy experience. Just hearing Holden and Grant yelling their lines is pure gold! Watch for Robert Foxworth (Prophecy) as a demonic corporate drone. Add this sequel to your satanic elf-shelf..."
4,islamic art & Architecture Geommetric designs,"good book but all in black & white don't expect any beautiful photos as examples. the ways they do these designs it is just what you 've got. Mathematics explainations only useful for experts but the drawings speak for themselves happily. Way too expensive, a souple cover and smaller size would have been enough"
4,Works as hoped,Nothing special about these except prices. Do yourself a favor save somr money set theses cables and not expensive ones from a major store. These will work just as well for normal av connections.
4,"OTTO PREMINGER, OPUS 19","***1/2 1954. Directed by Otto Preminger. A singer, a farmer and his son journey down a river while Indians are following them. Imposed by the 20th century Fox producer Darryl Zanuck on Preminger, RIVER OF NO RETURN is an entertaining film but may disappoint the fan of the great director who'll search in vain the shadow of his personal obsessions in this film. The songs performed by a superb Marilyn or Robert Mitchum performance, taciturn as usual, could nonetheless lead you to add this DVD to your library. Recommended."
5,I love it!,This movie arrived in much better shape than I expected. This was a great movie with Marilyn Monroe and Robert Mitchum.Thank You!
1,Support is a huge problem for this otherwise good product,I loved my replay until something went wrong with it. I have never experienced such horrible customer support from any company providing any type of service in my life. Basicly if anything goes wrong you are just screwed. It's unbelievable. Lifetime subscription is only a subscription until it quits working.
5,What else do you need?,"Stop live shows. Slow down the action record anything and share with your friends and there are no stupid monthly fees, I love it buy it for all your friends"
1,Hopkins is Dangerous,"It is hard to believe that this author ever read the Prayer of Jabez. It is filled with his personal jealousy and disdain for those that God has blessed. He holds Bruce Wilkinson responsible for interpretations by those outside of his control.It is a shame that a person (Hopkins) with apparently little Bible understanding challenges a man that has taught millions and has pursued The Great Commission with such fervor. The fact that Wilkinson gave his money to the Kingdom of God, moved to Africa to serve God should demonstrate the he put his money where his mouth was.Too bad Mr. Hopkins has chosen to block the entrance to the Kingdom in such a way."
3,The Cult of Jabez,"I have not read ""The Cult of Jabez"" yet, so i cannot compare it to the Prayer of Jabez. On the other hand, I have read the ""Prayer of Jabez"" and can say that i enjoyed it. That does not mean that i necessarily agreed with everything Wilkenson says. However, readers should be more concerned with looking at the two books in a well balanced light instead of insisting that the authors write in a well balanced way. of course they will present the two extremes.The one teaching i remember from the Prayer of Jabez is not about asking the Lord to expand my territory in a material way (which is not a bad thing to pray, i.e.. ""you have not because you ask not""), but bless me and expand my territory in a spiritual way ... i.e.. ""Lord, put me in front of someone today who needs to hear the gospel. Bless Your work here on earth through me"". based on some of these reviews, i'm beginning to wonder if some of the readers and Mr. Hopkins himself should re-read the Prayer of Jabez."
4,Nice lamp,"We purchased this lamp for use in the corner of our sectional for a reading light. It started out being very simple to install but then when only one of the three holes lined up, it became a bit frustrating. After loosening the screws a few times trying to get it all to realign, it did work. It isn't super tight against the wall but yet it is firm enough to turn on and off without feeling like it is going to fall off. I didn't like the shade that came with it, only because it was a bit large and wide for our area, so I went to Walmart and purchased a more narrow/slim shade that works perfectly. Overall it is a great light that has a nice, smooth swing arm motion with plenty of light for reading. We are quite pleased."
1,completely dissatisfied,"I needed a swinger wall lamp that is white & although the description & photo indicate the item is white, I called 1 Stop Lighting on 10/27/07 and spoke with Jeff Dawe. I asked if the shade & fixture were white or off-white or cream. He checked for me & said it was definitely white. I received the lamp today & the only thing about the lamp that is white is the cord. Now they are making me pay the return shipping. If the company had given me correct info about the product, I never would have bought it & wouldn't have go through the trouble & expense of returning it. I will NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN & NO ONE ELSE SHOULD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Hooray for heavenly writing!,"Mr. Snicket's refreshing voice continues to be a presence in this installment of sad events. His prose conjures outrage in the reader, while at the same time will not let you stop reading! Characters are introduced beautifully and woven into what appears to be a completely seamless plot. In this set the reader will cheer as the Baudelaire trio make a powerful decision on how to live their lives, a decision that changes their approach to the danger around them.Oh read it!"
4,"Volume 8, New & Original (well almost)","I'm a mad And1 fan in Australia & I always look forward to getting the new Mixtapes.Volume 8 has the And1 team hard going at it, The new guys; Spyda, Babyshack, Pharmacist, Spinmaster; Shane and the guys @ Gun Hill & many other features that you & I have never seen before. Although I like Mixtape Vol 8, the tricks & dunks ain't original anymore & less creative as say in Mixtapes 1 to 5. The team are trying much harder than in Season 03', but I want to See more creativity when It comes to new moves. Pharm is SICK in this DVD and so is A.O! I recommend this DVD to anyone!"
3,Fascinating story,"Heads up: There are several different translations and abridgements of this story, one of the great classics of Chinese literature. Make sure and choose a version that is right for you.The stories are neat but a little repetative. I would definately recommend an abridged version.Still, the adventures are interesting and give an insight into Chinese culture and mythology."
5,Best Kit Ever!!!,"Purchased for my granddaughter for her Birthday. The quality is excellent, she has been enjoying this gift, since she received it!!! When I read reviews, it truly helps a lot, so I decided finally to review also. Hope this helps someone to decide on purchasing also. My granddaughter is 10 years old, and even at her age LOVES creating on this LOOM,"
5,Delightful Classic,The colour is wonderful after 50 years and the old cars steal the show. The London to Brighton race of antique cars is memorialized in this comic romp. It is laced with sexual tension which was far advanced for 1953. The luscious ladies shine in this look at men and their manic fascination with motor cars. You take a trip back in time and see post-War London and Southern England scenery at its best. A very sharp transfer which shows-off great Technicolor. Fun and quite memorable. A British Classic which was a hit in America. Larry Adler's harmonica music is one-of-a-kind and classic in itself.
3,wont play in the USA,I didn't even know that DVDs differ from country to county. How can I get a copy of this British movie to play for my Mom in upstate New York?
4,Great headphones for a tough customers with small heads,"I bought these because I was tired of my 23 MO toddler constantly begging to wear my folding headphones and finding foam pads pulled off, etc. etc.Well, she loves hers and will walk around in them all day long trying to plug into everything, and in the red color and they are so cute and retro. So far they exceed ""will it survive"" test. My toddler is somewhat rough on her possessions. I have seen her step on one of the earpieces and pull the other one up, then jump on it.I'm not sure how the sound quality racks up with the other children headphones out there, but they sound fine to me for watching videos. There is no volume control on the headphones themselves but they don't protect for external device going too loud so parents/caretakers be careful!"
3,maybe.................... not!!!!,"i so dont know what to think???? yes i do ewwwwww. this is the ugliest barbie doll. the cloths are pg-13 and the makeup looked liked it blew up and EVERYBODY know that my scene copied bratz holiday line. but im not staring a fight, this doll is just wrong and i think you guys should save your money for something better instead of a stupid toy you know will be in the closet in less then 3 days"
1,Taylors Scottish Breakfast Tea,"Very disappointed in Taylors Scottish Breakfast - especially now that Harrison & Crosfield is out of business.The malty heartiness of the H&C; product is so far superior that already, the worldwide loss is being felt and broadcast.I have three H & C Scottish bags left and I'm saving them for a special occasion.I would pay top dollar for any boxes anyone might have squirreled away.Please contact me if you have info about H & C Hearty Scottish Breakfast tea.Many thanks,NYCwritergirl"
3,Two tone watch,This watch has a gemstone type glass face which makes it hard to read the watch (blurry). I didn't like it. The watch itself is beautiful. I exchanged mine for the one with the flat face crystal and I love it.
2,Kind of goes on and on,The comments by others about how the book at time rehashes statistics are true. At times I found myself glossing over pages just because it was number after number. I lost interest.I also got to the point with the author's repeated fixation on 9/11 that I had to put the book down. Enough is enough. That fixation only revealed to me the fact that the author's insight and point of view is very limited to the current and is United States centric. The author doesn't address a broader global view of wants and have a historical perspective of why people want to help other spot future trends.
3,The seven Year itch,A movie they had trouble getting made to the fact that at the time it was taboo to show a married man having an affair on screen. In order to get around it they made the whole affair a fantasy in his head. The part the really surprise me about this 1955 movie was that the husband actually cared about his weight and health as that wasn't an issue normally talk about in most movies of 1950s and 1960s like you might have mention in movies today.
1,Beware of the Missing Voicetrack,The soundtrack played so there was music but no voice track! I ordered a second copy and that didn't play the voice track as well...beware!
3,"Uhh, well, Okay!","I can't stand movies that were once plays with only rare exception.This movie was not one of the exceptions, the running expository narrative by Tom Ewell is well necessary but way too talky for a movie.Marilyn is amazing to look at and charisma to the max, Billy Wilder shot the scenes from a distance to approximate the theatre experience I assume, which keeps the movie visually a bit stiff I think.Three stars thanks to MM otherwise it would be less."
3,Breezy Entertainment,"""Nadine"" is an example of the quirky choices that distinguishes Jeff Bridges from his peers. It's also an example as to why Bridges is not as big a star as he should be. ""Nadine"" is not a bad film, far from it. It's just so...slight. It goes down easy like a bottle of Lone Star beer but you've forgotten it an hour after you've digested it. This is really surprising considering not only the talent in front of the camera but also the presence of Academy award winning director Robert Benton behind it. That said, Bridges and Kim Basinger have good screen chemistry that make the film eminently watchable. Good art direction depicting Austin, Texas circa 1954 and cinematography from master lensman Nestor Alemendros. The bottom line is that this is a good film to pass the time as the summer wanes."
3,Intesnity in ten cities,"This book is a completely amazing book, full of wonder and mytical intrigue. I wasn't sure of what was pulling me through this novel, but as I got ""into"" it I realized all of the intricate detail and ties for every foreshadowing. This author has obviously had their share of trials and tribulations as a child, and his bitterness and later, self-realization, is come to terms with. And, in the end, a completely well adjusted individual pulls through all of his troubles and resolves his broken ties."
1,"Bad, very bad.","This book, while an utter failure as a novel about reincarnation does unintentionally succeed as a study of what religion can do to the human mind. Guilt, especially religious guilt of a sexual nature, rather than reincarnation is the true theme of this book. Not surprisingly, the protagonist's latest incarnation is as a priest--and his religious paranoia has caused him not only to self-mutilate by hacking off the offending organ, but also to kill the object of his lust--who, naturally, he's come to see as an evil temptress bent only on destroying him repeatedly throughout the centuries. This study in religious hysteria and the wages of ""original sin"" is either laughable or extremely annoying. I found it to be the latter."
3,Needed more fun...,"This film is about a brooding young film editor who gets a crack at directing a ""Barbarella""-esque sci-fi flick feature he is working on when the flamboyant director is injured. One would think that finding oneself in 1960s Paris, directing a movie starring a beautiful girl would actually be fun for this young guy. But, no. Thinking the paying work is shallow, he works harder at making a self-indulgent film about... himself. He constantly takes up the time he should be using to galavant around Paris by filming his angry girlfriend and making his own monologues into his 16mm camera. The underlying message of ""CQ"": Some people miss the signal to be happy."
4,Good for the money,First off its not the same mouse in the picture shown. The coloring is totally different and its not shaped like the picture either. It has a very basic shape and is not curved for better grip and comfort. All that aside its still a decent mouse. Compared to any other optical mouse its [a good price].
2,It was allright,"If you have an appreciation for history, you will enjoy this movie. There are not too many movies out there that is based on the way the Japanese were treated during WWII. Although I enjoyed that part of it, I felt that the love story was too unrealistic!!"
2,Good Documentary but nothing new to learn,"This documentary is good, interesting but you won't learn anything new. It's the ""basic stuff"", things you can easily find on the internet or that I have seen in other documentaries. In a way this documentary is only a recent version of the ""In Search Of..."" episode of the 70's, so nothing new."
3,It could be better,"Contained various thoughts from many known and unknown people. It was not a concerted effort of compiling the various quotes; it's there, you can contemplate the writers' message. It could have been better. I liked the thought for the day having a calendar date."
1,Not for me,Prefer the NIV translations. Reminds me of when I was a kid in church and had no clue what they were talking about.
2,Daily Strength for Daily Needs,Not really what I was looking for. Some of the wording leaves me hanging and I have to re-read it. Not a simple and to the point devotion book like I wanted.
1,FYI,OK however I probably won't be purchasing it again. I only purchased it for daily use but now as expected.
2,Not my style,I really tried to use this book for my morning devotional. I didn't like the translation nor the stories behind the devotional.
3,Daily Strength for Daily needs,Daily Strength for Daily Needs was an okay daily read but was looking for something more and found one I like better
5,Great way to begin a day,"I was looking for scripture and thought as I began each day, this has readings for everyday and frequently fit my needs for the day. This book figured greatly in ""The End of Your Life Book Club""."
4,Fresh Air from the 19th Century,"After reading years of late 20th century self-fulfillment books, I found Daily Strength for Daily Needs to be a refreshing change. The excerpts and quotes focus often on patient acceptance of life's difficulties and the cultivation of humility. Not popular topics in a ""fix-it"" society! Other centuries have valuable perspectives to offer us as we seek to distinguish which elements in our faith are eternal and which are merely culture-influenced fads."
5,Good little toy,"This toy does exactly what it says. It does dive and come back up. However, my five y/o got pretty bored with it after a few minutes. But he does ply with it every few days so it's not a total waste and for the money, pretty good, I'd say."
3,fine edge pro?,Really like the shears and paring knife. Most commonly used item however is the shapening metal...EVERY TIME I use the other knives.I would say they don't really keep their edge...have had this under 2 years.
2,Disappointing,"I have only made one recipe from this cookbook. It was very tasty, but required some ""pre-cooking"" before putting all the ingredients in the crock pot. Many of the recipes call for this. I really don't want to have to saute first and then use the slow cooker. I want to cut down on time. Also, many of the recipes call for using a coffee can or rack in the bottom of the crock pot. I don't have empty clean coffee cans lying around and my crock pot doesn't have a rack."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with many writers and I wish I'd seen these reviews before. A huge disappointment, regular recipes with lots of preparation needed and options at the end for slow cooking.Not what I was looking for and I bought two (one as a present) I want to send them back.Not worth the money."
1,Not for Vista,It is hard to find from the advertised product information that it will not work with Vista.
4,"""Mr. Oxley's been complaining about my puncuation","""so i'm careful to get here before nine""...MM has this classic and very funny line in this movie. It's the line that I always remember. That and ""Find someone to type this"", Charles Coburn says to MM, his secretary.This is a great comedy from the 1950's that stars Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers. Marilyn is in a supporting role as the secretary to Charles Coburn, but she truly shows her side as a comedic actress in this. I have always been a great fan of Cary Grant, and he is just hilarious as the absent minded doctor who is trying to concoct a youth serum. Little does he know, all it takes is a monkee..this is a fun movie. and it shows the comedic talents of grant, rogers, and monroe.."
5,Another Family Favorite We Use Over and Over Again,"Just a note to let you know how Deborah know how pleased I was with the book of recipes for making my own bath products..and other Mabel White recipes I have used. I have used my book over and over and made gift baskets for family members and friends for special occasions. Anyone can use the easy to followrecipes and end up with fantastic gift items. We make our own ""spa"" baskets for ourselves as well as our friends in the RV crowd......keep up the good work!! God Bless..Christine Mead"
2,I have to agree - not as described in title,"I was very excited when I ordered this book. But, it is not what I expected. In the DVD while informative- she does not go into what amounts she is putting in.In the book - I found six pages that just repeat itself- accually pages 1-18. Most of recipes you could get from any web site that does bath & body .It is a good book it you are just looking for recipes for products. It does not go into when you put this together you get this. I use this now as a base for my formulations and can keep them in this book."
1,Half the product that Illustrator is,"If you look, you'll see that FreeHand has the same number of ""features"" that Illustrator has. However, each of the features in Illustrator is SO much more deep than those in FreeHand. For instance, transparency in FreeHand is limited to solid colors of individual paths, and you can only stack a certain number (3?) of transparent paths on top of each other. Compare that to Illustrator, where transparency can be applied to anything, from text to paths to pixel images. And Gradients, and mesh. And just the stroke or the fill (and to mulitple strokes and fills on the same object). Or to groups or layers. And then there's all the Photoshop blending modes like lighten, hue, difference and more. And opacity masks.Maybe ""half"" is giving FreeHand too much credit."
3,LOVE IT/HATE IT,"While I LOVE Freehand (I have been using it and buying all the upgrades/updates/whatever since 1988, when it was owned by Aldus!), I can't recommend it now. Unless they improve their program to appease the complaints all of us have (mainly, that it's evolved into what we hate about all the other programs out there), I'd recommend looking around. I've seen Xara LX twice today; there's also Inkscape (I used it a little while when I was on a PC, and it was pretty good - and was FREE). Also have noticed a couple I haven't checked out - Karbon14 and Skencil 0.6. I'd really recommend looking around before you spend $bigbux$ on a program that's not what it used to be 2-3 versions ago. I'm probably going to see if 8 will work on my OS 10.4.11 - probably not without using it in OS9 (maybe a pretty good solution). Keep looking, or DL a free trial."
4,Good Book,"Good book. The plot carries along pretty well and is generally pretty interesting. However, I think that, at times, the author tries to infuse too much of his knowledge and explain the truth behind the truth of the truth."
1,"One Big, Giant ""HUH?""","The first film, THE OMEN, is one of my all-time favorite movies, but the sequels go from watchable (DAMIEN: OMEN II) to downright baffling.By the time we get to this film, THE FINAL CONFLICT, it appears that the filmmakers have completely lost touch with their source material and have no idea what they're doing.Did any of them bother looking at the Book of Revelations?I understand budget restraints and such, but how can you literally change biblical prophecy to fit their lame story?The people who saw the original film and were filled with dread understood the coming evil embodied in the demonic child.By the time they get to THE FINAL CONFLICT, they've got to be scratching their heads.The Second Coming of Christ is going to be a tad bit more cataclysmic than featured here.And the fate of the Antichrist is completely baffling.THE FINAL CONFLICT is like making a movie about Adolph Hitler and he's assassinated in 1936.Think about it."
4,"A little weaker, but still worth it for any Omen fan","Omen 3: The Final Conflict is a good ending to the series and is a pretty good sequel. The only problem is that unlike the other too, Damien is too mean, you really dont want to follow him, and the other character we'd noramlly turn to for someone to root for are paperthin and it's impoosible to care about them. I really got turned off when Damien demanded that all the babies be killed. But the ending is good and a suprise cameo ."
3,Could have been better,As a fan or the Omen trilogy the last one I thought fell a little flat. Sam Neil does a good job as Damien and there are some creepy scenes but the film never realizes it's potential. The whole movie the characters discuss the final confrontation between Damien and Christ and there really is none to speak of.
3,Gotta love those bumbling priests.,"And all the gruesome ways they fail attempting a hit on Damian.And seriously each of them armed with a single Knife of Meggido???Didnt Bugenhagens instructions in Omen call for the knives to form the image of the cross once Gregory Peck had finished stabbing that little devil, how would one do the job????So the ""Christ Child"" is born again, though I thought the bible says he will return and put his feet down on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, not be born only to have the massacre of the innocents occur again thanks to Damian.A sickenly sweet sugar coated take on the Antichrist theme which should have been done as St John of Patmos revealed in all its epic sweep and horror or not at all."
1,"Lousy, boring, not scary, and forgettable","Read other reviews for a description of the plot, because...Last night a friend of mine, who loves this movie, said, ""Remember that one part in The Omen 3.......blah blah blah...wasn't that a good scene?"" I said, ""I've never seen that movie."" He said, ""Yes you have. I brought it over that one time."" I said, ""When?"" He said, ""Like maybe two years ago."" I still didn't remember it. Then he began to describe it more. Then I suddenly vaguely remembered the movie. I said, ""Oh yeah...I think I remember now. That was like in February 2009 when you brought that over. Yeah, I didn't like that movie. That's why I forgot all about it. It's a forgettable movie. It didn't stick with me.""The above paragraph sums up my feelings about this movie. It was so lousy, boring, and not scary that I ended up forgetting that I even saw it. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time seeing it."
4,Surviving Jim Crow,"This is an excellent book depicting the efforts of african americans in east texas to find a place in the sun. A place away from the bigotry surrounding african americans througout america. Even if your ancestors are not from east texas, this book describes the people, their lives, accomplishments and struggles to make a life for themselves. Despite the omission of any reference to Winona, Smith County Texas, one of the most successful community of black people in perhaps all of texas. My personal bias aside, this is a well written, well documented, easy to read narrative of early black communities in rural texas."
5,Micro Innovations,"A cordless mouse is the way to go, particurlary Micro Innovation's PD400W. I've had problems with other mice but never this one. I can't remember even when I bought it (it's been that long) but have only replaced the batteries once. It's light weight and size make it very easy to use. And you can buy it at a great price!"
3,Wireless mouse is disadvantage if you are clumsy,"I liked the feel and functionality, and so forth. Plug and play worked fine. The connection was maintained even through 3/4 inch pressed wood. After a few days however I found that the problem with a wireless mouse is that it has no wire! It fell to the floor several times a day because there was nothing to constrain it; it was awkward for me because there was nothing for ease of retreival (I have somewhat limited mobility). So if you are at all clumsy like me, beware."
1,Caveat Emptor,"Buy with caution. The dimensions of this product, particularly the height, do not account for fact that some non-Henckel knives, especially those with larger handles (a) do not fit at all or (b) the knife handle does not sit flush thereby increasing the height beyond the stated dimensions which in my case means the drawer will not close."
5,Henckels drawer knife tray,I love the knife holder. It is very convenient and keeps my counter clean. It arrived quickly and I am very pleased with the purchase.
4,Alllllmost perfect,"This knife block works great in my drawer. Only problem is that the ""big"" knife is a little thicker than the regular knives so as a result it sticks up a little bit but not a bad thing really. I'm glad I bought this. Saves so much counter space."
5,good buy,"Our motley collection of cheap knives used to be strewn all over the bottom of our utensil drawer. When I got a set of very expensive Wusthof knives for my birthday, I knew we needed a better storage solution. I've never been a big fan of knife blocks because they take up valuable counter space so an in-drawer solution seemed like the way to go. I was right. This well designed knife tray has turned out to be a handsome addition to our kitchen. It stores up to 12 knives (6 small and 6 large) and even has a slot for a knife sharpener. The best part is that we no longer have to worry about cutting our fingers everytime we reach in to grab something out of the utensil drawer!"
3,I love Frank Miller...but,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Frank Miller. I also love the illustrator Geoff Darrow. Together they produced Hard Boiled, a marveoulous, dark, confusing tale. The problems with Big Guy and Rusty...is that it's all flash and no substance. It's like that prom date you dreamed of all through high school. Pretty, shallow, and um...pretty. And it's short. It could be that this is what the artist and author were going for. It might be that it is built out of a reverence of Astro-boy, Manzinger-Z, and other popular ""big-robot"" old school cartoons. But for Frank Miller...I'd expect a bit more bite for my buck.In any case. Three stars. 'Cause it's pretty."
1,This was a stinker,"I preview what I read to my kids. My 3 year old is a big superhero fan, and we enjoy Batman the Brave and the Bold together. As most comics these days are aimed at much more mature folks, its a challenge to find something age-appropriate. This looked like the ticket, but the overtly American-first, God-loving robot was too much for me. The story and characters were so derivative of things I've seen elsewhere. The artwork was good, but the story and characters just didn't do it for me."
1,Avoid if you have a MacBook Pro,"I can't speak to other computers, but this is not a good choice for MacBook Pro owners. The card inserted fine, read my SD card properly and quickly, but when I closed the MBP it wouldn't go to sleep. It would start to sleep, then immediately wake up again, then try to sleep, wake up, etc., in an endless cycle. I e-mailed Kensington tech support about it and received no response whatsoever. I'm not inclined to waste my time begging for their help, so I returned it to Amazon.I've checked out the reviews for several adapters of this type, and many of them seem to have this same problem, so it doesn't appear to be unique to Kensington. There's one review on theSandisk SDAD109A11 Digital Media Memory Card to Express Slot Adapterthat says it works correctly with MBP. I'm trying that next and will post a review on that product's page one way or the other."
5,Great reference for beginning or experienced sewer!,"My mom recently started doing crazy quilting in her spare time and was looking for a good reference to help with some of the ribbon embroidery. I did some research and chose this one as a Mother's Day gift - she was thrilled! The pictures are beautiful, instructions are clear and easy to follow, and the construction of the book is sturdy. In addition to the actual stitches, the front chapters include topics such as preparing, stretching, and finishing the fabric. Well worth the money, this is a valuable resource my mom will use for years! Highly recommended!"
3,Disappointed - ugly flowers,"I am new to ribbon embroidery. However, I was disappointed by the embroidered flowers in this book. They are just not attractive. I happened to find a great forum with completed projects, some done by the beginners, and after seeing that I just cannot keep this book. Unfortunately, Amazon would not allow links in the review. I will try to attach the link to a comment, hopefully it will not be removed. If I had an opportunity to look inside this book, I would have never bought it. Embroidered examples in this book are sloppy, I do not even want to attempt these to get such results. I rarely return books, but this one is going back."
5,Beautiful work,Simple to understand and great directions.I enjoyed the small projects inside.Write more please. Anyone interested in embrodiery should buy this.
3,"Review of ""Cuentos: Tales from the Hispanic Southwest""","The stories of 'Cuentos' are themselves quite entertaining. The topics are often moralizing, and end in quick jabs of comedy.My main concern with this work is that the English translations are not word-for-word. The English writing insists in his introduction ""these stories are alive."" Using this guideline, he crafts loose-language translations; their plots are accurate, but sentences are often added, causing confusion in places for a fledgling billingual reader.In all, the book is enjoyable."
1,Not worth renting much less buying!,"The story does not seem to have anything to do with the killings in Juarez. The film is filled with fake boobs and bad acting. I was hoping for something having to do with those killings. This is NOT even worth renting much less buying. I am horror fanatic and this is one of the worst films ever!!!! On the back of the box, it refers to the director as a ""master in horror"". Maybe to himself, but if anyone else thinks so, that's just sad. It was so bad, I had to write a review for it.This film deserves zero stars!!!!"
1,For those who love fly sound effects,"This movie is an absolute waste. I only paid $1.00 for this and I regret every single red cent. The acting is just horrible the plot doesn't exist. Well it does... three people lure women to a camp and kill them... thats it. No, I'm serious thats the whole plot it's 81 minutes of that. We actually never even learn the names of the victims. The gore is just fake and very stupid. Oh, and lets not forget the greatest soundtrack ever to grace a movie. Including such hits as echo of shovel digging dirt and constant drone of flies flying. If you like to sit down with friends and bash on bad movies this is probably your kind of thing. If you just love watching movies but always say ""This movie needs more fly noises then you will be in love with this. But, if you are a normal everyday person and have half of a brain in your head then for all that is holy avoid this movie."
1,Put that Dog Turd Down ! Don't even think about it.,"I have seen many bad movies and have liked some of those, but this is in a league of it's own.There should be a real hard beating given to the makers of this movie and I for one would change my name if I were in this flick.I paid $3.00 for it at the Mexican swap and shop and the illegal that sold it to me is feeling pretty bad about now knowing it was $2.99 to much. You will be better off slamming your hand in the car door then trying to set thru this one. Story: what story ?Acting: some of the worst I have ever seen. Direction: NoneVisuals: Ha Ha.Forget this movie was every made, wish I could."
2,"Not a history, not a memoir","T. Moffatt Burriss failed in his attempt to give HIS memoir of fighting with the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment during World War II. The book bounces from a historical narrative to a personal memoir, to a collection of others memories. All combined, this becomes a disorganized account of one of the best fighting units of World War II. Mr. Burriss is undoubtably a brave man with combat jumps and many front line combat days, but he should have either written a memoir or a history. His attempt to do both failed."
5,Strike and Hold,"One of the best WW2 books I have ever read. Could not put it down. It is real. It is unique, not a re-hash of all the other books out there. You are there with the author. You can tell it is written from experience. GLad I ran across it!!"
3,Marilyn sings & shines...,"This film is a must see for any devoted MM fan. Although this isn't one of her better films, it showcases her singing abilities with a few musicals numbers: After you get what u want you don't want it, Heatwave, and Lazy. She was fun to watch, even though, from what I have read, she wasn't having too much fun on the set. Her presence onscreen is like watching a star shining brightly in the sky. The story is good. It does have a few slow momments, but it entertains. I also thought that Donald O'Conner and Johnny Ray were very good too. O'Connor was a good dancer and shows his stuff in this film. I recommend this film for your Marilyn collection, if you like watching her sing, dance, and act in glitzy musical comedies. This movie is worth seeing to see Marilyn and Johnny Ray belt out some tunes and watch O'connor step in time."
2,Unionized,No one is a bigger fan of BH than me.I have all of their Cd's and have enjoyed all of them until now.The songs of this CD are unispiring and rather dull.For myself I hear nothing that sounds like a melody that is anywhere near the classic mix of traditional and comtempary sound that has made them a great band.The songs seem to be aimed at the Union Station crowd.I gave up on Alison Krause a few CD ago and if BH continues on this path I'll be looking elsewhere.
3,"Not a lash extender, just a lash repairer!!","If you have short lashes to begin with (Like myself) this product will not extend the length of your lashes. For those who already have long lashes, they probably think it's making it grow longer, however, this serum is just a conditioner and only restores fallen hair or tattered hair. It will not make lashes longer! So if you just want to have your natural lashes back after ruining them and thinning them out from mascara use, this product will restore your natural lashes."
2,Still available from HP,"I can tell by looking at the photo of these ""universal"" styluses that they won't fit my iPAQ 1945. They're too short and the cap is wrong. I found the ones I needed on HP's website for a reasonable price."
3,a bit bland,"i made curry with half a bottle of this and it still was a bit bland i prefer thai curry i can get at the asian marketsif this is bland, crush some garlic cloves and add cardamon, chii peppers and ginger to heat it up and some sirachi chili sauce its awsome then"
5,The book has it all...A Spy-Thriller Classic,"...one of the best books I've ever readSuspense. Intricate, but believable plot. Good character development. Excellent.Overview: CIA Operative with amnesia tryings to discover who he is.Opinion:It is difficult to keep a plot based on amnesia from getting too much like bad TV, but Ludlum pulls it off.The twists and turns when this very solid storyline made this book difficult to put down. Further development of Carlos's character would have been nice, but you can't have everything....a Classic."
2,Not that great,"The idea and the plot of this book (along with other Lundlum books I've read) was exellent, that's why I gave two stars instead of one. Lundlum, I think, is not that great of a writer but like I said he has good ideas."
2,Great ideas=Great Book?,"Unfortunately, this is not the case. I saw the movie first and figured that the book must be even better. What I found is that the movie took the best parts of the book: some characters and a loss of memory. That is where the similarities end. The book has little of the excitement and intrigue of the movie. Ludlum tries to have many characters with different plots and motives, but in the end I simply wanted to watch the movie. I enjoy books and try to stay away from being so critical (I just want an enjoyable read), but for those who want CIA/multiple plots in thriller/action style book should read some of Tom Clany's earlier work.Final View: Ludlum had some great ideas and a few good characters, but that is really all it turned out to be. He should have sold this idea to a more capable writer. Watch the movie and use the book to keep tables level."
2,200 million copies can't be wrong but...,"I agree that this is a page turner, but that't about it. The plot is incomprehensible. The ""man-woman-crisis-love"" scenario is too easy and corny. What? The protagonist just accidentally gets spotted in an obscure bar on the day he makes his comeback? Give me a break. People get killed all the time, while Jason Bourne and his girl miraculously gets away. Does Mr. Ludlum think that a high body count is essential for a thriller? Also, his story of high-level conspiracy is too wacky to be credible.All in all, this novel reads like a very complicated version of a James Bond movie. It is my second Ludlum after ""The Chancellor Manuscript"", a novel which the comments above applies equally well. This will be my last Ludlum."
5,Not Free SF Reader,"Ludlum's 11th novel is clearly his greatest. The story of Jason Bourne is told with white hot intensity. A man with amnesia washes up on a beach, is cared for, and when recovered enough, goes looking to find out who he is.It is a complicated thrill ride, and his own former agency, and the assassin Carlos the Jackal are out to get him. He picks up a woman along the way as an unwitting accomplice as he fights to stay alive, as he fights to recover his memory, and the truth, and why he keeps remembering mnemonics for the early letters in the alphabet."
1,Unbelievably Boring,"I decided to buy this book to kill off a weekend reading a good thriller. My weekend was ruined! First half of the book is quite engaging and action-packed, but when Ludlum started these long and horrible dialogs I just gave up and trashed the book."
4,Finally available for Kindle.,"I had been waiting for this book to be available for Kindle and downloaded it with great anticipation. I did enjoy the book and in some areas did not want to put it down, Ludlum certainly spins an interesting tale, but I'm not sure I like his style. It could be a bit wordy at times. Overall an enjoyable read."
5,Ludlum was a master.,"So many of the 'spy thrillers' of recent day seem recycled (for lack of a better word). Ludlum did a fantastic job of not only creating a unique storyline, but a unique lead character in 'Jason Bourne'. In the opening stages of the book, not only is Bourne a mystery to the reader, he is a mystery to himself. It's as if you are learning about Bourne as he does (as an amnesiac). The plot has central ties in Paris, but the characters make appearances around the world. By the end of the book, it seems as if the protagonist is completely riddled with bullet holes but still manages to come out alive. This is the first (of 3) in the Bourne series. If you've seen the movie (which was very good), make sure you still read the book. The book is even better...which is usually the case."
5,Exciting!,"My husband and I saw the movie based on this book, and he went right out and bought this book. He read and highly recommended it. Although it's not my regular genre, I started reading and couldn't put it down! It is so thrilling, and so much better than the movie. If you are like me - liked the movie and wanted to know more about Jason Bourne - this book is definitely for you!"
4,Intrigue and mystery,"Basically well written and interesting. Extremely detailed, sometimes too much time is spent on insignificant details. Good intrigue, another Robert Ludlum book such as only he writes. I would recommend it ."
2,Tangled Mess,"I read this book when it first came out because I liked the concept of a trained assassin who has amnesia being on the receiving end of assassination attempts and, as a result, trying to figure out who or what he is. However, the writing is bad, the plot is convoluted, and Marie, the main female character, is not empathetic: she falls ""in love"" with the person who threatens and beats her. The ending is convoluted, too. Not a satisfying read. The movie was much more enjoyable."
5,Not Bourne Yesterday,"Reading this highly explosive excerpt from the thriller is as intense as being the main character and dodging the arrray of gun fire and if that wasn't enough he must also overcome some fierce typhoon crazed weather. The best excerpt I have read , can't wait to read the book and for the movie."
1,"Dated 'thriller' that put the ""C"" in ""Contrived""","If you liked the movie, don't bother with this dated book. The movie and the book resemble each other very little, and the writing is mediocre at best. Way too many contrived sequences, and I found myself wishing I had not bothered with this."
3,"Good story, not told so well","The story and concept behind Bourne Identity is great. It is one which has been somewhat retold through the movie. However the book is a slow and sometimes dry read.Ludlum seems to lack what great authors have. He can create a good story, however in the good story he fails to hold the attention of the reader. It has very little flow to it, and is a very slow read. I've read several books that are just impossible to put back down. This one was hard to pick back up and continue reading.For those of you just wanting a book to compliment the movie this is not it, just to warn you. The book starts off roughly the same and then from there on it is like having two different stories. Which is not a bad thing, just do not read the book in order to have something like the movie. I think the movie makers became as bored as I did with the book and decided just to make something up on their own after the first couple of chapters."
2,Dismasted,"This is a very earnest and a very poor job by a couple of big talents like McQueen and Wise. The film is so relentlessly downbeat and so completely devoid of humor that it's simply not believable; just a ham-handed Vietnam allegory about a US gunboat in China. As good a director as was Wise, he wasn't very adept at improvising when a script wasn't working out; he just went ahead and filmed it. It's this shortcoming that separates him from the really great directors."
4,Great epic/adventure/romance,"The Sand Pebbles is a Steve McQueen vehicle, no doubt one of his best movies, but it is also the unacknowledged epic of the sixties, when the genre began to decline as a mere Hollywood spectacle and was becoming a more thoughtful, more complext adventure that took on momentous themes--like the emergence of China as an independent country and world power. Add Candice Bergen, at her freshest, Richard Attenborough emerging as a key figure in movies, and several Hollywood veterans, like Richard Crenna, and you have a mix that offers both entertainment and a thoughtfully staged adventure, replete with exotic locales, suspenseful clashes, and a gripping ending. Longish, but nearly flawlessly directed by Robert Wise. The blu-ray edition restores it to its original glory."
3,Not as impressed as others were,"I found that moments were amazing (such as American in Paris), but the song arrangements, well, they've been done better by others - for example, Ella's Gershwin Songbook sets a terribly high bar, and Blossom Dearie totally owns Little Jazz Bird. The guys in this group aren't bad but the reedy tenor(s) and the close harmony eventually numbed my ear like overeating potato chips - after a while you don't notice the flavor. So I recommend this CD cautiously."
5,Oxford Thesaurus of English,"I use every dictionary and thesaurus I can find to buy. I really love the Oxford Thesaurus and their dictionary also. It rides as a pop-up, meaning when you double click a word Oxford pops-up in the upper right-hand corner of the monitor with your answer. Love it to pieces!"
1,Used to Love It...Not so much now,"I used to love love love this product.But it is not compatible with Windows Vista. I had it working for the longest time and it was fine. All of a sudden, it stopped working.Reinstalled and I've used the ""compatibility wizard"" several times trying to get it to work.My favorite Thesaurus is no longer accessible.If you have anything later than Windows NT or Windows 2000, don't buy this. Find something else newer that is compatible with your operating system."
3,Good for beginners - not very thorough,"This is good for beginners as it starts with the basics and slowly builds up. If you are travelling to a country where Arabic is spoken you will find this product useful in helping you learn phrases to do basic tasks. However it will not help you gain fluency.I listened to this on way to work, and even though I think I learned quite a bit, many native Arabic speakers didn't understand exactly what I was trying to say because some of the Arabic they teach you is often 'fus-ha' or classical (not always conversational). The other point to note is that there are MANY dialects in Arabic. This CD has a mix of Egyptian and Gulf Arabic(more Egyptian than Gulf). So for example, there is a completely different word for 'chicken' in the Egyptian dialect when compared to the Gulf.Overall, it is a good beginners product. If you want to achieve fluency of the language I recommend taking a course in classical arabic and then learning a dialect."
5,Great for little hands,"These are wood and the perfect size for little hands. We play counting games, color games and stacking games with these blocks. My 2 year old grandson and my 8 year old grandson love to play with them. They even make up games to use them."
2,Demanding...,This book would work well for use with a tutor or professor. Hard to follow if you are doing a course or your own on line. I found myself have to seek advice online and from other sources even though I read and re-read many of the chapters.
5,9,"First of all they are both Henckel Pro-S knives. They don't have bad points.#1 The country knife has a slightly curved blade as compared to the straight edge of the regular bread knife#2 The country is 1"" longer (duh)And the winner is . . . 8"" Regular. The reason? They are both made by Henckels and both are top of the line. Unless there is a real need for an extra inch of cutting surface and slight curve to the blade for a couple of bucks more(and so far I can only see that holding a bigger knife is more spectacular), go for the 8"" regular unless you really believe that bigger is better."
4,Decent chair,"This was worth it since I got it on sale for a great price. Only complaint is that the elastic holding the ""pillow"" in place quickly stretches out from outdoor exposure and then doesn't stay in place."
4,"If you really, really LOVE women...","Think of any adjective, any that comes to mind...cute, funny, sensual, sexy, interesting, fascinating, beautiful, hell, make up your own list. You will see each and every one portrayed in these photographs. The women in these photos are all of the desciptions you can think of and some you haven't thought of until you looked at these pictures. A tribute to the ""fair sex""."
4,great smell!,I bought this cologne for my husband for his birthday. He really likes the scent a lot. Very nice manly scent without being too overpowering and strong.
1,I have not received the magazine yet,i purchased this quite awhile ago and i have still have not received it yet!!! How long will it take???
5,"L'aventure mieux ecrit, l'histoire le plus complex...","L'affaire Tournesol et probablement l'aventure Tintin le plus complex. Tout d'un coup, Tournesol disparait. Le retrouver n'est pas tres facile. Tintin et le capitain travers tout l'europe pour le retrouver. Puis, l'aspet scientific et interessant. Il-y-a meme une scen avec dont Tintin conduit un tank!C'est vraiment super. Il faut vraiment penser et suivre pour comprendre. Plein de supense, c'est un aventure mega-super. Il faut le lire!"
3,it's 0K,kinda cheap plastic. much bigger than I expected and a bit cumbersome to install but it's ok. I'd think that just keeping the napkins in a drawer would be more effective.
3,Not as good as pop-a-plate,It's okay but too many times you pull a bowl out and they all come down with the holder part. It's just a very slight shift to unlock it to reload so it doesn't take much to accidentally unlock when you're just trying for one bowl. Never have that problem with the plate version.
4,Gators Fanmat,"Love the colors and the design. Not durable enough for an outside rug, but perfect for use inside the house. I put mine under my husband's desk just to keep that area cleaner when he sits down there with his boots on."
3,WASTE OF TIME,"THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH THE EFFORT. THE BOOK MAY HAVE GOOD BUT SOMETHING MUST HAVE GOTTEN LOST IN MAKING THE FILM. THE CHARACTERSRUN AROUND DOING STUPID THINGS FOR A WHILE, THEN IT ENDS. MUCH OFIT IS UNINTELLIGBLE TO THE POINT YOU WONDER WHAT IS GOING ON. DON'TWASTE YOUR MONEY."
3,aspect ratio confusion!,"Overjoyed to finally get this film on dvd, I was stopped in my tracks to notice that the 1.85:1 presentation of the film appears to be missing a good portion of the top and bottom of the picture, when compared to the VHS fullscreen version. Check out the 20th Century Fox logo or any other freeze frame to confirm this. The dvd provides just a little bit more picture on the sides, but leaves out a whole lot horizontally! What is going on here? Is the VHS version a sort of open matte, with the 1.85 being closer to what was actually shown in theaters? If so, what's up with the switch to side-bar letterboxing during the movie's ending credits? I've never seen a movie switch aspect ratios like this, so I'm inclined to believe that, if anything, the original aspect ratio was closer to 1.66:1, but not 1.85:1. Dammit, I want answers!"
5,ZORBA THE GREEK,"WELL, BEING OF GREEK DECENT THIS MOVIE HAD A SPECIAL MEANING FOR ME. MR. QUINN REALLY CAPTURED THE HEART OF THE FIERCE GREEK MALE OF CRETE OF THAT ERA. I WOULD IMAGINE THE MALE OF CRETE IS STILL THE SAME IN SPIRIT.I HAD A FRIEND WGHO WAS AN OPERA student And after seeing the film went off to Europe to pursue his studies and career.THANK YOU IT WAS A PLEASURE.T. NIKOS"
2,Totally unacceptable,"Sorry to disagree with those who consider this a great classic.Firstly, technically, the DVD is not of great quality; the fabled greek landscape is all murky, the sound track undistinguished.Far more importantly, the 'story' ,40 years later, is totally unacceptable. I would think that the people of Crete would not have been at all happy with it even in the 1960s. An innocent widow is stoned and has her throat slit...and our heroes do nothing....A dying woman has all her possessions stolen by not just the hideous crones invading her bedroom but the whole village invading her house...and our heroes do ...nothing.And the heroes then make things better by dancing on the beach. So thats all right then.They celebrate the Greek way of life. Except it was not all right in the 60s let alone the 2000s. Most disappointing film I have seen for a very long time. Acting, of course, superb. Gains the film a second star."
2,Imprimatur?,"Read this if you want to know the theology that has led the Holy Church to the precipice in the last fifty years. Cardinal Josef Ratzinger(Pope Benedict XVI) noted that sin will continue to the end of time and the only way to eradicate it would be to eradicate Free Will. Gerald Collins has found a quicker and easier way to eradicate Sin. Conscious denial of Sin makes one a deadly enemy of Christ's Holy and missionary Church, whereas being a sinner makes a living soul a candidate for mercy and salvation. Traditional concepts such as the Church's Mission, Salvation and Sin are scant. The Church exists not to court the popularity of the World but to save souls."
5,the renaissance at war,this is an excellent book for anyone totally involved with the history of the renaissance. I recommend it highly.
1,Not Worthy of the Name,"The Fly II is one of the worst movies ive ever seen. The first fly had great effects and was lucky to have jeff goldblum as the star. Eric Stoltz is a bad actor and he gives an unworthy profermance to his proceeder. I give this movie a one (because i cant do a zero!) and warn anyone that this is a bad movie but if you like this kind of sci-fi/horror movie, i strongly suggest that you watch the first fly! At no time in this movie was i ever impressed, except for the brief moments containing Jeff Goldblum. I was also happy to see John Getz return, but sadly not as good as he used to be. BEWARE THE FLY II!"
2,Lame sequel to Cronenberg's classic,"David Cronenberg's The Fly turned out to be better than the original, thanks to the director's unique vision, an eerie performance from star Jeff Goldblum, and superb Oscar winning makeup effects from Chris Walas. The Fly II finds Walas returning, this time in the director's chair, picking up where the first film left off. Goldblum's mutant offspring (Eric Stoltz) is raised by the company he once worked for, who have every kind of exploitive intention in store for him. What results is a pointless and predictable revenge yarn that lacks every bit of personality and poignancy that Cronenberg managed to lace into the first film. While The Fly II boasts some decent looking gore and effects, the overall result is a dud that not only fails to live up to the first film, it doesn't even come close. All in all, if you've never seen The Fly II, you haven't really missed much."
3,"""The Fly"" launches Cronenberg as a director to watch","Forget about ""Fly II"", but the classic sci-fi movie ""The Fly"" is worth watching (about once every five years) as it's a truly romantic story, sensitively realised by Canada's David Cronenerg. ""Romantic"" actually means ""Roman"" plus ""romain"" for novel, plus ""roamin'"" for ""On the Road"": what a zesty multimedia stew these ingredients make!""The Fly"", like the wonderful 1957 movie, ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", is really about men feeling badly about themselves - old, male lions in the myth-emersed world of postmodern consumerism. The plot line: We men have offended as youngsters, and now we must watch the pride from afar, as outcasts, much like Marlon Brando in ""One-Eyed Jacks"". And so it is with Seth Brundle. We love Seth because he's (like Cronenberg, I'd guess) the Roy Orbison archetype: weird but sweet. This guy LOVES sugar!"
5,You've got to get this book,"After five great books, Christine Feehan does it again. The 6th book in her Dark series, ""Dark Fire"" tells the story of Darius, one of the lost Carpathians. After 1000 years of living, Darius finds his lifemate in the human woman, Tempest--and the roller coaster ride starts there. This is a must buy book. As a fan of Ms. Feehan, this book was very much anticipated--many buying copies in advance. Although the story is part of a series, it can stand on its on. Ms. Feehan treats her readers to the woderful world of the Carpathians--a wonderful twist the the vampire genre. Ms. Feehan writes not only for just one groups of readers her stories can be enjoyed by romance, paranormal and suspense. She is one of those authors readers eagerly wait for and once you read her books, you will understand why. I had to wait for this book's release, and believe me, it was well worth the wait!"
5,Great Catholic Film for Children!,"I watched this a lot when I was younger. I grew up in a strong Catholic Portuguese family. I absolutely LOVE this film! It has great motives and meanings for children. The Children of this generation should follow in the footsteps of these little 3 saints. Lucia, Jacinta & Francisco. I'm sure your children will love this film and ask to watch it over an over again! God Bless!"
2,lickety split,fred wesley said it himself george clinton should have left this in the can somewhere these were a bunch of unrelesed tracks recorded from the 70's and george clinton wanting to put out some new pfunk picked these jams this is awful the best song on here is lickety split which has a smoking bassline from bootsy collins and fred gives one hellava trombone solo other than that don't waste your money.
3,For intermidiate or advance intermediate,"Poor graphics on cheap paper really ruin this otherwise useful book. No cut diagrams, limited furniture options, no beds, dated pictures of tools. Some good tips on joints, history, finishing. very simplified projects. Better than ""The Weekend Woodworker. Project Collection"" (forget that one). This book would benefit by being twice as long with a progressively more diverse projects-- beds, dressers, tables, etc. No layout diagrams."
5,A Great Thinking Book,I really liked this book because it made me look at my own beliefs in order to understand Chariots of the God. Interesting and I bought another one of his books right after I finished this one.
3,Theoretical but tempting,"This is an author that you really need to read his earlier works to follow him. Not this this is a difficult read, it isn't- but because he expects the reader to make quantum leaps with him at times. In my opinion this is not one of his better works. None the less he is consistent in his style and topic. He is an absolute authority on this subject, even if he is one of the very few people who give academic weight to his theories. His reasearch, his facts and suppositions are all impressive. Read it to follow the Von Daniken trail but don't start with this one"
1,"The ""Reefer Madness"" of archaeology","It amazes me that anyone can take this book seriously, much less consider it a way to open one's mind. It amazes me that this book is still in print. It amazes me that von Daniken is still writing.Highlights for this book: first off, von Daniken exhibits all the typical behavior of Martin Gardner's ""hermit scientist"" -- long on speculation, short on proof. Second, mentioning people like Edward Cayce favorably. Third, an undercurrent of racism inherent to much literature of this type (""of course zey could not haff made zese; zey are not European!""). On top of all that, the edition I have would appear to be a fairly bad translation of a ridiculous book, making it perfect reading for those late-night toke'n'Twinkie sessions.Get this used. It's not worth the price of buying new. I got mine for a quarter at a library discard sale, and since I don't smoke pot..."
3,Aliens ?,"Von Daniken's celebrated book talks about how aliens visited earth eons ago and it is because of them much of our science / arts exists.The proof given by him seems very very believable but i am more inclined to believe Calvin (of Calvin and Hobbes) when he says""The surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere is that they have not tried to contact us"""
1,Chariots of the Gods,"This book horrifies me. There is not one single shred of proof anywhere in it. All the conclusions he reaches are based on either an overactive imagination accompanied by psychosis or downright fraud. Instead of researching his findings he simply makes judgments on the fly that have no basis in reality. I couldn't even find this book entertaining as to how poorly it was written, how fervently he states is ""facts"", and the absolute lack of scientific integrity. If you really want to read it get it from a library don't waste money on it."
2,"Mostly a crock, but interesting.","Actually, I thought the ""shocking theory of prehistoric UFO visitations"" was first advanced by Captain Kirk in the Star Trek episode ""Who Mourns for Adonais?"", but that's neither here nor there.I first read this book immediately after watching the TV film he had produced, complete with awe-inspiring background music and grandiloquent narration. The vast majority of the ""evidence"" he cites only vaguely--if at all--suggests rehistoric visitation by aliens. Worse, Von Daniken seems to believe that early human civilizations were incapable of putting one brick on top of another without alien assistance. On the other hand there are a few compelling exceptions, like the ""astronaut"" paintings in southern Algeria.All in all it's a fun read, but don't take it too seriously."
3,Chariots of the Gods,"Ten years ago I found this video to be almost invalid with no supporting documents. Being a scientist, supporting documents are important. However, years later having read the book of Enoch, the lost books of the bible, and The Gospel of Thomas, this video gives new meaning. The Chariots of the Gods'video with other documents have triggered me to further explore the truth of man as defined by God."
1,"psychology, not archaeology","This is a sneaky book. Von Daniken expends most of his energy attacking the supposed close-mindedness of the scientific establishment. This tactic predisposes the reader to want to disprove him -- to demonstrate that he or she is open-minded and willing to consider facts that don't agree with a pet theory. This makes the reader let down his or her guard, afraid to question von Daniken's evidence. His evidence? A few dozen seemingly anomalous finds linked together with a liberal helping of speculation and a heavy reliance on arguments from incredulity and a refusal to believe in any coincidence whatsoever. If you insist on reading this book, be as skeptical of his accusations of close-mindedness as you are of his theories (or any theories, for that matter)."
1,PSUEDOSCIENCE!,"Von Daniken's theories are pure psuedoscience that can only impress those who do not have a sufficient background in science. The ""evidence"" he presents does not hold up under critical inquiry."
4,Wonderous History,"Makes one wonder about our (human) past. The engineering involved in not just the lines and graphs, but the under ground water ways the tranverse the plateau to supply water to the villages from the mountains is a kin to the Roman Aqueducts! Very EDUCATIONAL!!"
4,Interestingly Hilarious,"As a movie that you might find yourself watching to gain some insight into the ways of the ancients and how they ""may have"" been influenced by Aliens, or some other sort of extra-terrestrial life-form, this one is probably a good bet to get a better laugh than gain knowledge. The group I watched it with thought it was hilarious, if you've seen it you can imagine the one-liners we came up with such as: ""Look... you see that rock over there? Erik Von Daaniken thinks it is shaped like a lazer gun because they used to see the aliens wielding them..."" Absolutely hilarious. In it's entirety this movie was a vast sea of rhetorical questions being sailed by the master himself. (daaniken). A good laugh, not much substantial info however."
3,Entertainment value only - no extraordinary evidence for aliens here.,"""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."" - Carl SaganUnfortunately, no extraordinary evidence exists here, just plenty of ""what if"" speculation. The author uses gap theory to [insert aliens here] where scientific research has yet to determine the answer. Gap theory is often used by the faithful as a way to credit god with the still-unsolved mysteries of the universe. von Daniken uses it to ""prove"" alien intervention with absolutely no evidence, extraordinary or otherwise, to back up his claims.But I knew this going in. The real reason I read this book is because Steven Spielberg and George Lucas used books like this when they were first forming their ideas for the original Indiana Jones movies. See [...]l for more information. In this aspect, the book is quite fun and that is how it merits 3 stars from me. I would give it another half star if it were not labeled ""non-fiction"". Enjoy it for what it is - entertainment."
1,"Pseudoscience, not astronomy--please!","I'm so tired of this and other vonDaniken books and vonDaniken clones showing up on the list of new astronomy titles. Please, amazon.com, file this book properly: under occult and pseudoscience! This classic of crank scholarship (if one can ruin the word ""scholarship"") has long been discredited as the bad science it truly is. Why does this and other crackpot books by this deluded charlatan continue to be republished? C'mon, folks! Read about the REAL world of archeology, history, anthropology and astronomy this piece of drek purports to be. Please, don't insult your own intelligence or that of our ancestors by reading this silly stuff! You'll just be wasting precious time! ANY book by Brian Fagan, for example, or Jared Diamond can satisfy your curiosity about our fascinating past. And you'll be discovering REAL science, not the wild claims of a crackpot!"
4,Complete Fiction,I enjoy the ideas of another people. The book was completely fictional but I did enjoy hearing he's ideas. Chapter 2 really grabbed me it sets the tone for the book (I think).
2,"Fun, but Ridiculous","When I saw a very old copy of this in the dollar bin at the library book sale, I snapped it up. What a hoot! This is the book that spawned a zillion sci-fi books and Coast-to-Coast AM shows.His theory that extraterrestrials visited ancient Earth is very interesting. It would have been much more compelling if he hadn't felt the need to drag in Project Bluebook and Edgar Cayce. His projections for the future of Earth and NASA are really funny forty years later. I can't tell you how many times I laughed and had to read passages out loud to my husband.I can live with the fuzzy logic and faulty reasoning. What I cannot abide is Daniken's unwavering assertion that ancient peoples were all knuckle-dragging troglodytes. Time after time he insists that ancient people could not possibly have the knowledge or intelligence to make any of the objects that have been found by archaeologists. I could go into a long rant, but the bottom line is this: We are not descended from idiots."
2,There Can be LOTS of Other Explanations!,"This is a worthwhile book to read. The author did some pretty good collecting, and his theories are tantalizing, to say the least. It is a shame that he had to repeatedly ruin some good information with the single phrase ""There can be no other explanation.""He repeated this phrase throughout the book. Each time I saw it, I cringed. This phrase tries to cut off debate, stifles analysis, and generally hurts the credibility of the entire work.When people are so convinced of their own position that they try to suppress any information to the contrary (even rhetorically), they are degenerating to the level of the ""Thought Police"" - or worse.Sorry Herr von Daniken, you blew it."
3,"Okay as a documentary, I prefer Woodstock 99 instead","Compared to the ""Woodstock 99"" and the original ""Woodstock"" (1969) tapes, this ""Woodstock 94"" tape was ""less"": less exciting, less fun, less memorable. I was curious about the '94 event after seeing the '69 and '99 Woodstock tapes, and it did satisfy that need. And from seeing the movie, the live event in 1994 probably was a good time. But as a movie, for entertainment value this tape comes up a little short compared with the other Woodstock tapes. Is it because ""Woodstock 94"" was produced by PolyGram Records, and ""Woodstock 99"" was produced by Sony Music? Maybe. Or was Woodstock 99 just more fun? And was the original Woodstock (1969) just better and more memorable (a classic)? This ""Woodstock 94"" tape is unlikely to become a classic...it is just a documentary. A documentary that will fade from memory."
2,2 Bands out of a weekend of peace and love (Woodstock 94),"After wasting my time and money on PPV I give Woodstock 94 a thumbs down. 2 stars, 1 for Traffic and 1 for Santana."
4,Millennium DVDs,No complaints about this product. The picture represented the picture shown. The product shown was shipped on time for my need of the item.
5,Works just like any other xbox 360 controller.,"I bought this controller for my cousin for christmas and it came in 3 days just as planned with Amazon Prime. When I came over to check up on it. It feels, and controls just like his original first controller only Black. Which I think looks great because you get to be different from all the rest. (Like owning a iriver apart from everyone in the world that owns a ipod)"
5,Great controller.,"The D-pad is the weak link, as in all 360 controllers, but overall it is still the best controller out there."
5,The Best Controller for Xbox 360 and PC,"These controllers are awesome! I tend to buy a new controller frequently because I wear out the joysticks so fast (playing for hours and hours; its not the manufacturers fault, just wear and tear from use all the time).The black color is great because I play in the dark (for a cinematic experience) and tend to ""zone-out and immerse my self in the game""My only wish is that someday Microsoft will add a HOLD switch so if you put down and the pick up the controller, you don't have to worry about tossing a frag grenade on accident."
1,keeps turning off,I just got an Xbox 360 and it is great. The controller that came with it works perfectly. I bought another controller to play with my friends and the controller turned off after 10 minutes. I turned it back on and the controller turned off after another 10 minutes and it kept doing that. I thought maybe the batteries that came with the controller were messed up so I changed them. Even after that it kept turning off every ten minutes.
4,Great piece of hardware.,"Well put together, get's it done. ONLY complaint is how fast the ridges wear off the thumb sticks."
5,A classic,"This movie is a classic! Early Danny DeVito, Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner with a great story: comedy, suspense, action, even a little romance, but low-key, even the kiddies will love it!! I can't recommend it enough. It would make a great gift for anyone - even grandma would enjoy it!!"
5,"Comedy, Romance, and Adventure all in One!","I've seen this movie many times since it was first released, and it keeps getting better. Impeccable performances by Kathleen Turner as the uptight, hopelessly romantic novelist, and Michael Douglas as the crude, adventurous con-man who steals her heart (and her treasure map!). As for Danny DeVito---hilarious, delivers his wise-cracks with comic precision. And who could forget that alligator?!? Creatively written, perfectly cast, great scenery and musical score. A must-see!"
3,"preposterous hollywood fun, but a used template","This film has all the typical elements of an adventure flick: vivid good characters, ugly bad guys, and a ridiculously complicated plot. In other words, systemtically formulaic. As far as it goes, it isn't bad, but there is no peculiar magic to it, no unique fun however good the actors are. At least for me, I did not feel I had lost myself in it at all, but kind of went along as I watched it."
3,Not as I remember,I remember loving it years ago when I saw it in the movies. I just didn't get the same enjoyment this time although it was entertaining.
3,Love is a Many-Splendored Thing,"This was a good, old movie. Initially, I didn't think it was as predictable as most of the time until reflecting then it is obvious that the ethics issues with the story line are as expected. for the period. It is interesting to see how times have changed."
3,Not the best I have had,I was glad they had this size of paper but the lines were not dark enough for me. Usually Tops has paper with dark blue lines. Not my choice.
5,MJ awesome on and off the court,"I bought this DVD without really knowing what to expect. I didn't really expect the IMAX feeling to translate well to a smaller screen, and to tell the truth, it doesn't. But that is not a problem here.Michael Jordan is an athlete larger than life and he does not need a big screen to relay that. His messages are powerful and his philosophy is an excellent source to anyone, but especially if you're raising children. He loves children in general, specifically his own, and a lot of what he says relates to children.You will not be let down by this DVD, the message is powerful and MJ on the court is always a delight."
1,Everything Is Pretentious,"What an overrated, pretentious and annoying author. This book started off pretty entertaining, then became unbearable by the time Safran Foer employed his 5,000th literary technique to show off how smart he is. Whoopdeedoo! You're smart! Guess what? Who cares? Well, a lot of people do apparently, but that's only because he wrote about the holocaust. Now, the nerve of this guy, his next book revolves around 9-11. What a revolting way to sell books. And his article in Playboy? The guy wrote an article about blank pieces of paper. He really is atrocious."
2,Frustrating,"I really wish I liked this book more. Having heard over and over again what a prodigy Foer is, and having been more than a little intrigued by the release of the upcoming film version (starring Elijah Wood and directed by Liev Schrieber) I had high expectations. While it kept me turning pages, I found my interest lagging about halfway through. While it isn't without its poignant moments, I was too distracted by the author's showmanship (look at me, I'm a talented writer and I'm under the age of 30 ... aren't you impressed???) to really focus on what the author was saying or the emotional journey his character's were going through.Not recommended."
1,What?,"I thought this was one of the worst books I've ever read. It seemed more like an exercise in self-indulgence and at times wondered if the author wasn't under the influence of various substances - throwing in sentences at random and ideas as they seemed to appear in his consciousness.Admitedly I finished the book after each painstaking page - I kept hoping ""everying would be illuminated"" by the end. But I was left a little angry at having wasted so much time with these people I didn't like or care about in the least."
2,"Funny, flawed first novel","I had better refrain myself from compositing this review in the finesse of ""Everything is Illuminated"" or you will get very spleened or else end up making ZZZs.""Everything is Illuminated"" is a wonderfully fresh and witty first novel with a central pair of characters you really root for. However I found the structure disatisfying. The chapters alternate between the translator and the US hero narrating their adventure in Eastern Europe. It's almost a bargain basement two-for-one approach to novel writing. You compose a couple of parallel stories and then splice them together.I enjoyed the way Foer handled the dynamics of the central relationship in the book, as the two men make an uneasy friendship, but sadly my interest petered out a third of the way through. There was however enough talent on display to make we look forward to his future books."
1,Definitely Over-Rated,"I heard so many great things about this book that I couldn't wait to read it. What a disappointment. The jokes aren't funny and the language of Alex is just plain annoying. Although it seems he intended well, the chapters are choppy and all over the place. It seems to me that Mr. Foer is one who was in the right place at the right time and surrounded by the right people. One is left to wonder if the book would be so highly rated if it came from someone who didn't go to the right schools, didn't know the right people, and wasn't born into the right family. I'm all for reading new authors, but this is one author I won't read again. Ever."
1,Shockingly bad,"Alright, I will admit I've only read the New Yorker short story. But that was awful - mannered, self-absorbed and completely false. I find it hard to believe that the novel can be much better. I have spent years working in Ukraine, speak Russian and Ukrainian, and I found the character of Alex simply ridiculous. Evidently Alex's butchering of English is supposed to be humorous, but unfortunately none of his dialogue sounds anything like a native-Ukrainian speaker attempting to speak English. Caricatures are not funny when they're painfully off-key. I'm shocked that this is the book of the season. If you want a good, funny, real novel about Ukraine try ""Death and the Penguin."""
4,Everything is Illuminated,Great Book. Prompt mailing and good customer service. Thanks for being one of the best sources for unisual book on the internet.MR
1,Let's get serious,"Much has been written about the cleverness of this book and the mangled English of one of the narrators. Let me add to the verbiage: how far can one joke stretch?There's a lot of desperation among readers of 'serious' fiction. The thought of a literate, ambitious young author willing to take chances and make fun of sacred cows (the holocaust in this case) has proved to much. Well, I may be desperate, but I'm not going to lower my standards. I found this book tedious to read, much like the experience of watching someone else's precocious child 'entertain' party guests: fun for a moment, but soon causing a feverish hope that the clever child can be sent to bed, so the adults can talk.And let's be honest: the skewering of 'sacred cows' has become so common that the term itself is without meaning now. There's nothing brave in doing so -- it's become a standard literary, and marketing, conceit."
1,Wrong order disappointed,I actually bought the wrong book on my kindle and did not know how to remove after the blurb for made a mistake ...so I started it but realized it was not what I wanted and I did not read any more .Did not like this book at all
5,Everything is Illuminated Illuminates Everything,"Incredible. Brilliant. Wow. Yes, genius. GENIUS. This is good. It is good that we have a writer like Jonathan Safran Foer who commands debilitating laughter with the same and uncommon ease with which he draws out tears, it is good that this is a book that has something to say, it is good that what Jonathan Safran Foer has to say is good. When you finish Everything is Illuminated, you will catch your breath, wait for your heart to slow down, and slowly come to the realization--like recovering from a coma, like waking up from a nightmare, like surfacing from a pool full of sewage into the light of day--that everything is, indeed, perhaps, just maybe, illuminated. And that is good."
5,Incredible,"As a trendy hipster I consider myself a consumer of new exciting authors. Although Foer has become a bit of a buzz worthy, name dropper author if you want to appear well read, he is incredible. This may well be my favorite book of all time. Could I give more than five stars?"
1,good effort but way pretentious,"Although the kid has talent, he does not have it in spades and the novel is ludicrous, overblown, a fake Yiddish pastiche of third-tier Salman Rushdie and Zadie Smith. Stay away."
3,Just redeeming enough,"I've never even written an Amazonian review, but with this book it was necessary. Chock full of mindless dribble and historical inaccuracies, what could have been a good book enters into idealistic allegory and boredom. This much is apparent from Foer's self-named character (""the hero""), who writes to connect himself to his past and does manage to string together a message, but is overly wordy and strings symbol after symbol into only a shadow of a heartfelt story. Sadly this takes up most of the book!Still, the redeeming qualities were stark. The layout, for one, was creative and necessary. Every so often, the reader needs a break from the shtetl nonsense to the more sincere character of Alex. This side of the story really evokes the need for human connection and the sacrifices that requires. Alex saved Foer, friend, but with every turn of the page I hoped for cataracts."
2,Publishing Industry Smiles,"Young man with thesaurus writes ""funny"" Holocaust novel. Gullible public, eager for ""prodigy,"" obediently follows publishing industry prompts. Book is not funny. Book is fatuous. Very little is illuminated. Gullible public, having been instructed that book is ""brilliant,"" leaps to defend its assigned genius. Outcry and debate only increase sales. Publishing industry smiles"
2,Average Good Simple Book,"A good debut novel, but lacking in substance.Hopefully the writer will gain much needed confidence in hisnext attempt a literary nirvana."
1,Everything is Obfuscated,"The book started off well enough. I laughed at the translator's bad English. Unfortunately the plot never quite took form, and was interrupted by pointless tales from the shtetl that lacked any coherence or relevance to the ""main"" story. I kept reading hoping the loose ends would come together, but they didn't."
2,What?,"This is another book I just did not get. I am starting to feel like a bonehead, or an intellectual midget. This guy is supposed to be some young superstar, but I think he'd be better off waiting tables. I thought Alex was funny, but I tired of his goofy English after about 2 pages. Okay, JSF, we get how clever you are, and how ha-ha-ha funny. Nope, this one wasn't for me. I guess you can't win 'em all."
2,too strange to enjoy,"I picked up this book because everyone raved about it, but I hated it and gave up trying to get through it. I was especially annoyed by the affected fashion of the writing and the strange and disturbing ways the author depicted Jewish life as he imagined it was lived in the distant past in Europe. This is the type of book that ""intellectuals"" love to praise because of its ""complexity"" but I think that the average book lover would, if he or she were honest, admit was badly done. -- Judy Gruen, author, ""The Women's Daily Irony Supplement"""
2,russian new yorker,"I really wanted to like this book. I have many things in common with the author and the topic of his book. And, I read three glowing reviews. Sadly, I could not get past the first 20 pages. I found his writing style and the use of italics and all caps to be TIRESOME. I don't want to waste my time laboring over this book when I have so many other good books I can't wait to read."
1,negative,Unconnected plot. No resolution to convoluted plot. Characters have incomplete descriptions. Can a writer be considered artistic if there are three to five pages of ................ or over-repeated phrases? It was interesting enough to finish (laboriously) but I feel no resolution to many of the plots and characters. I do not recomend this book.
5,Just like Snickers,OMG. This is the best protein bar. It tastes like a Snickers bar. I've lost 70 lbs using the Pure Protein bars and shakes.
1,"If you order this, Order it separate from other orders",I made the mistake of ordering this at the same time I ordered a ball mount. It shipped quick the only problem it was in 3 pieces. Also this product does not fit a 93 chevy silverado extended cab fleetside 4 x 4. It was too big. Still haven't found a mirror to fit it yet.
4,Great Album!,"This is a Great Album. I was first introduced to New Order when I saw the movie ""More"" by mark osborne. It's a great stopmotion animation. Check it out at [.....]and click on More.Anyways, New Order is great, definitly glad I bought the disk."
1,Book 2 not available in Kindle for USA customers,"Do not buy the Kindle version of this book if you live in America, as book two of this series is not available for purchase by Americans (although I'm baffled as to why books one and three are available to us). If you buy this book and enjoy it, you will not be able to buy the Kindle version of the second book in this trilogy."
4,Good story,I adore the tales of Valdemar by Mercedes Lackey with such characters as Vanyel and Skif Talks And so many more. Although it nauseam a bit slow this story is another examples of an excellent author with with her ability to create a fascinating story around the charachter building and set ups for the next two books... I would easily recommend any of the Valdemar series to anyone.
3,IGps-360 USB Adapter,This adapter was purchased for the purpose of connecting a Ricoh digital camera to a Dell 4550 system. This device proved to be useless for this application as the computer failed to recognize the device. As this is the only application I have for the device I can not tell if it actually functions as advertised.
4,The Game that is laying the Smackdown on all other Wwe Games,This game is Great it has the elimination chamber and first blood match it also has a better season mode you can even go to your GM and demand a title shot or jump shows there are several superstars Kane {unmasked} Undertaker Stone Cold Rock Triple HBig show Brock Lesnar A Train Batista everyone has there new music except for Kane
5,Awesome game,"I have gotten all 5 Smackdown games over the years. SD5 is by far the greatest. Only major gripe is that there are no double feature replays, that would be awesome. Tell THQ to keep that up for SD6."
4,Greatest Game Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game rocks. The graphics are amazing, and the storyline is good. The only thing they should change is getting commentary. (at least you get to see JR and the King). Also they nedd to put in Kanes recent entrance song. Also they now have blood that is so cool. Now they have body strength so we won't see the women picking up guys like the big show. Overall THIS GAME IS TIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,this game is the best,this is the best game ever it has the rock rey mysterio hhh goldberg kurt angle kane without a mask there has never been a game like this my family played it and they hate wrestling this game has alot of stuff you could get the animal super fly snukka and you could play a elemination chamber match and throw the wrestlelers threw the glass. the best part is you only have to earn money to unlock anything.
4,da bomb,yo this game is a thriller.u can play elimination chamber and bras and pannies match.kanes unmasked and they have almost every body.eddie goes out with the car u pick and they have there cheat 2 win shirt.nobody could make a better game this year than this.what ever you do buy this game
4,This Game STINKS,This game stinks.WWE RAW 2 for the XBOX is my choce. Who needs the dumb mactchs like bra and panty. That is just stupid. I need hard hitting ation.XBOX is alot better and Raw 2 is alot better. RAW 2 is alot better then that stinky game here comes the pain. Anyways I thought Brock Lensar was suposed to be a bad guy now!I like to watch Smackdown better the Raw on TV but the RAW 2 video game is mutch better!!!
2,HOW HARD IS IT???????!!!!!!!!,"LISTEN I HAVE BOUGHT EVERYONE OF THE SMACKDOWN SERIES AND AN ON GOING CYCLE IS EACH ONE LACKS WHAT IT;S PRE-DESESSOR HAD.WHY DONT THE LEGENDS HAVE THERE CHOICE OF COSTUMES AND ORIGINAL RING MUSIC.WHY DOESNT KANE HAVE THE LYRICS IN HIS MUSIC. IT WOULDNT TAKE UP SPACE CONSIDERING ""THE CREATE YOUR OWN"" MUSIC IS STILL THE SAME FOR THE PAST 3 SMACKDOWNS....PROPER USE OF SPACE MATE. ALSO YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH MACHOMAN, HOGAN AND THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR AS LEGENDS,,,,I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE GAME SOELY ON THERE PRESENCE.I THINK THERE IS ALOT OF TALENT BEING WASTED,THE ENTRANCES ON ""SHUT YOUR MOUTH"" WERE GRAND BUT NOW SEEM RUSHED.PLUS THE SMACKDOWN DOLLAR IDEA ""TO ACCESS THINGS YOU BUY THE ITEMS"".....NEWS FLASH....THERE NOT WORTH BUYING...BRA AND PANTIES COLOR CHANGE,,, RICO'S OUTFIT....BY THE WAY WHY IS RICO IN THIS GAME...I LIKE THE STORY LINES...VERY REALISTIC TO THE ORIGINALS IN TELEVISION...BUT ITS THE LITTLE THINGS THAT KILL.IM NOT SATISFIED."
4,The best game ever! DUH!!!,"If you like wwe raw,Yull love smackdown! Here Comes The Pain! But its stupid theres no Shane Mcmahon. Im not sure if theres Vince though, But it will be a happy day if there isnt a Vince in this game"
1,Gas from the past,"A dinosaur that hasn't been updated since 1974! And it shows. Nevertheless, it's still the basis for many magazines' styles."
5,Still the best,"I've had this book forever and was just checking to see if there's a new edition out. Like other writer/editors, I find this book indispensable. It's much clearer and easier to use than Chicago Manual of Style. Reading further into the reviews makes me want to find a first edition."
1,The quality has change.,"Most of the books that I have read from Exam Cram were tolerable even with all the those corrections. But this book is real bad, if not the worst - I'm not even through with it and I'm looking for another book to work with. This book is just not well put together. SAD!!!!"
4,Great film; HUGE gotcha,"One of the most enjoyable films of the 80s is Big, in which Tom Hanks... well, you already know by now.I liked almost everything about this 2-disc set.One MAJOR gotcha, however. Or maybe two, depending on how you look at it.If you play the Extended Cut (Disc 1) with the Commentary set to On, you get a) no commentary, and b) a Spanish soundtrack.If you play the Theatrical version with Commentary set to On, you get essentially nothing BUT commentary. No dialog from the film can be heard, as far as I could tell.Playing Theatrical or Extended versions with Commentary set to Off is just fine.The Extras disc is nice, but the aforementioned flaws should truly be addressed."
5,EXTRA SCENES ARE A TRIP,That stood out to me the most - having never seen all of these scenes that were edited from the theater and DVD editions. Some are good...some are very good and some were thankfully cut. I don't want to give away any. The blu-ray quality is terrific too.
4,An Classic Tom Hanks Comedy.,"A 13 Year Old Boy (David Moscow) goes One Night to a Creaky Amusement-Park, Fortune-Telling Machine to make him-BIG. But One Morning, he`s wakes up in a Body of a 32 Year Old Man (Tom Hanks), he`s runs away from Home to find the Fortune-Telling Machine but He ables to land Himself in a Toy Company in New York City and he falls in love with a Spunky Assisant (Elizabeth Perkins).Directed by Penny Marshall (A League of Thier Own, Riding in Cars with Boys) made a Clever Fantasy Comedy, thanks to Tom Hanks Oscar-Nominated Wonderful Performance and an Intelligent Screenplay by Gary Ross (Plesantville) and Anne Spielberg (Steven Spielberg`s Sister) made this Film Delightful (The Screenplay was Oscar Nominated). The Film also has a Fine Supporting Cast, Including:Robert Loggia, John Heard and Jared Rushton. This was One of the Highest Grossing Films of 1988. This is a Charming One. Grade:A-."
3,Happy Feelgood movie,"This comedy with Tom hanks starring started out with alot of flash and bang, but after the first half of the movie, kind of lost it for me.Tom Hanks is of course a fine actor, and the supporting cast including Robert Loggia had alot of fun making this movie, but it truly lost steam near the end.Enjoy some laughs"
4,brings me back memories of childhood,This movie features the old school fao schwarz toy store with the singing clock and the big piano which I would go to see every time I was in NYC as a child and playland rye which was a wonderful place to visit as a child and I still do so today
5,Tom Hanks just right,"Tom Hanks just right for this part. get in role with all he got! funny, you can watch it with Whole family)) even more then once)"
1,way off base,"I have studied Ninjutsu for 12 years now, and I have seen alot of people try to teach an art that they know nothing about. This is the poorest example of ninjutsu training I have ever seen. It is not even a training manual as much as it is an absurd attempt to give insight into the lives of the Ninjuts (Ninja). Save your money and buy one of Steven Hayes books."
2,funny at first,"at first it started pretty funny... ninjas are cool...yada yada yada... and i admit i like silly humor. then chapter 4 comes around, and theres nothing witty...its basically the same joke repeated over and over."
1,Yawn,"There were funny parts to the book, but they were all on the website, too. Save your money, go to the website, and see the good parts. The rest of the book is just boring."
2,Not as funny...,"I bought this book blindly at a Barnes and Noble a while ago expecting a good read (as it sat near two very funny, similar books). As I got to reading it, I found that it was not as good as I had hoped. Imagine having an 11 year old cousin who won't stop talking about stupid ninja daydreams that he had while at school. That's about what we're dealing with here. It was mildly amusing and clever at times, but ultimately left me so disapointed that I threw the book away.If you are an adult and looking for a good read from the humor section, I'd suggest ""The Alphabet of Manliness"" (Maddox) or ""The Zombie Survival Guide"" (Max Brooks). Both are extremely entertaining and a far better way to spend your money."
5,Awesomeness,"First, to all you too-sensitive types crapping about how this book or the website are *not* on how to be a real ninja or about how much it defaces the Ninjacular arts, shut it. Heaven forbid someone creates an amusing parody of anything. And if you're still all wringing your hands because you think this book or the website will make your kid flip out and stab his 4 month old baby sister in the eye with a stapler, how about exerting a little parental/testicular fortitude and not let him read them in the first place. What the hell does 9/11 have to do with this?That said, awesome book. Pick it up, read it, enjoy it. If you're broke, flip out, throw your grandmother down the stairs, steal her purse, and buy it. While you're waiting, be sure to pick up a ninja sword and some stars from your local convenience store."
5,I haven't slept in five days!,"I bought your book, I read it through and through, I got so pumped I bit some old lady on the face! Your book is so awesome, I burnt all of the books in my public library and left your book on the smoldering ashes! I'll never look at a ninja the same way ever again. During the course of your book, at the part with the hippos that weren't actually nice, I popped a 3-foot boner!!! I know its nothing compared to a ninja, but I'm trying.But seriously, you book is great, and the side story at the bottom of the pages really got me thinking. I love your site, and everyone who doesnt love it should commit seppuku immediately.Your Fan-Ty McCowin"
5,Maddox rules the universe.,"http://maddox.xmission.com/For the geniuses who haven't caught on, Madox did a satirical page like this on every stereotype. Check out the site for more on Pirates, Clowns, Mimes, and many other totally flipping out mega awesome cliches."
5,Holy crap! This book is awesome!,"My sister gave me this book with very high recommendations, and because of that, she is now my favorite relative. This book made me laugh so hard I literally had tears streaming down my face. However, behind all the humor was a darker story about a troubled little boy, and that side of the story made me want to reach out and hug him. Truly a great piece of work. The people who gave this book one star just don't get it."
2,Tedious,"Don't get me wrong. It's funny. However, if you've seen the web site, the book offers little that is new, and it gets old fast. This might be a good book to have as a conversation piece, or in the bathroom, but let's face it, people will probably think less of you if you own it."
5,NinjaNinjaNinjaNinjaNinjas and Total Awsomeness,Robert is either has a mental problem or he is a natural born comic genius my vote is genius. A book about a young child and his love of the Total Awsomeness that of the ninja. I had to put the book down and come back latter because I couldn't breath from laughing so hard.You want a good laugh and have a good time buy this book now. Or the ninja's will find you and if you read this book you know what they'll do to you when they do.
3,Second mosaics set.,"I purchased this mosaics set because I have in home day care. I already own a mosaics set that is similar to this one and it is the preferred one of the two. The Marvelous Mosaics set does not fit in it's frame as snug as the set I already own. The kids seem to like the fact that the ""older"" set stays together better. It can be held upside down and the finished mosaic will not fall out. I purchased the second set to put an end to the fighting over the ""older"" set. It only helped for the first use and then they were back and wanting the ""older"" set. It works well and does what it is supposed to do and the kids can be creative with it. Had I not had the ""older"" set the kids would have liked this one just fine I'm sure."
1,Not what I believe,I am so frustrated with myself for writing in this book. I could already in the first chapter that I did not share the same Biblical beliefs as the author. Hate that I can't get my money back.
5,Great,Really enjoyed this book. I am going to read and do the Bible study next time. I recommend this for any woman with contentment issues.
3,pretty good,I did this study with a couple really good friends and thought it was pretty good. I'm not sure you'd get anything out of it if you did it by yourself though.
5,Great product!,"I have to use sunblock because of my skin type. I have tried others and Neutrogena is the best! It is non greasy, (I use it under my makeup), blocks the sun rays and stays on long. When I go to work I have morning sun on the left side of my body and when I go home I have afternoon sun on the left side again. I had a ""farmers tan"", the strip on my arm and on my face. Started using Neutrogena and the stripe is gone. I use the regular Neutrogena sunblock on my arms and use the dry touch on my face and neck. I highly recommend these products to anyone who needs a good sunblock."
5,This one works,"I have very fair skin, but this product lets me be outdoors on the golf course or ski slope all day with only one application. This one actually works and has a non-greasy feel and drys very quickly"
2,BURNING STINGING IN EYES,"I thought I should share some info about this product. I am a big fan of Neutrogena. However, this lotion tends to run into my eyes and it really burns and stings. I use their 30+ sunblock stick, and it does not sting when you touch your eyes/face. I am SUPER disappointed b/c I really need to find an awesome moisturizer with high SPF that does not sting/burn when it is applied on my face."
5,Great Product!!,I use this brush every morning after I brush my teeth. Definitely helps get the mouth cleaner. I had always used my toothbrush for brushing my tongue and was skeptical about a new brush until I tried it. The thin profile is MUCH better and more comfortable - no gag reflex. I would recommend this product to a friend.
5,relation through beautiful music,"This is arguably the most relaxing music anywhere. It is lovely to take a nap to, fall asleep to..... use your imagination to......"
3,Get it for free and don't feel bad,"History books must be compared to their sources and to their author(s). This is an ok intro book to American History, but don't expect miracles. It would be a good ""primer"" for Children who are in K-4 depending on their reading levels (girls read better and earlier than boys) and their interest in History. While it is critical to know history, history can be learned and understood at much later ages than Math, Science, English and MANNERS!! So, pick it up for your children if you have a Kindle it is free."
3,What was he thinking??,"Mike Nesmith, even back in the days of the Monkees, was a great songwriter. This CD is a concept album. Kinda like Pink Floyds ""The Wall"" but not as good. It tells a story. The disc comes with a CD mini-book that you are supposed to read as you listen to the music.(That's what it says). Problem is, the music has lyrics, and I have a hard time reading and listening to lyrics at the same time. So I'm like , WTF???It's not a bad disc but, it's different. Cool idea, I guess but...WTF??"
2,Not authentic hero,"Sir Geoffrey is assigned to investigate a series of murders, first by his lord Tancred; then by the Advocate, secular head of Jerusalem; and finally by the Patriarch, head of the Church in Jerusalem. As he investigates with the help of his fellow-knights Hugh and Roger, he also has to dance around the complicated political allegiances and the possibility that one of the men he reports to may not want the truth revealed.Geoffrey is a likeable if not-completely-true-to-his-period hero. Part of the difference is explained by his interest in learning, but he still didn't feel right. I would have forgiven this if the story had held my interest, but it dragged by the time I was halfway through, and I finally skipped to the end."
4,really like this game,I bought this for my 5 year old son. He is really into these games and is capable of completing them pretty much on his own. I like the atmosphere of this game. The graphics are fun and well done. The characters are funny. This is not a dark and serious game like so many. The good (and bad) thing about this game is it's length. This is a very long game. The good part is that it won't be finished in a weekend. The bad part is that my 5 year old played it for over a month without finishing it and has burned out. Hopefully he will regain interest after playing something else for a while. I have really enjoyed watching him. (and playing parts of it when he'll let me).
3,Okay but not top notch,"Purchased this game for my son (Age 12), he got bored and frustrated within a few hours. I tried to give it a play and pretty much had the same experience. While not completely awful it certainly was nothing special. My biggest complaint is the game is just too slow. The character control could have been better and the camera logic needed some work - my son got motion sickness. While some people seem to really enjoy the non traditional characterization, I found the characters to be visually weird and the voice over to be somewhat poorly conceived. Tak mumbles a lot and seems to have a slight English accent, which is somewhat bizarre for a native.I don't recommend this game, if you are interested in it you should rent before you buy."
5,Wow !,"This game not only looks good, but it is so fun to play. My children love it. And it's funny too. From my 11 yr. old down to my 3 yr. old., they have a great time playing it."
5,Mindless Action No Way!!,"Progressively Awesome. If you like mindless action, this game is not for you. This game is about puzzles and challenges. My kids absolutely love this game. The game starts out on a learning level and advances to amazing. This game will give the whole family a challenge. This is an action adventure puzzle game to say the least. The graphics are great! The little movies between the levels are the funniest ever! The wittiness of this game is awesome.I would challenge people everywhere to see if they could solve this game. If you quit after 3-4 levels, you don't know what you are missing because this game gets better and better!!!!Gameplay 8.5Graphics 9.5Replayability 8Fun for all ages 10"
3,"Bad Gameplay, But Thanks Comedy Relief","This game is not that great. The only good features are the Juju powers and the fact that it's hilarious. From rams falling in love with sheep, to Lok being an idiot, to rams falling in love with Tlaloc, to making orangutans naked, to orangutans punching Tak across the face, this game's full of laughs, but that doesn't make up for the fact that it's a mediocre game."
2,Not so durable!,"I ordered this Kong Teddy bear toy based on reviews I read here. My dog is only 15 lbs but he loves to chew and destroy. I needed a toy that can keep him occupied and would be durable enough for him not to tear holes through. I have been satisfied with the rubber Kong toys so I figured I would give the cute teddy a try. My dog loved the toy however it was chewed through in about 2 days. I liked the removable squeaker feature however my dog was able to create a big hole in the face and body that having the feature doesn't really matter. He was able to chew through the ears, legs and arms the first day. By the 2nd day he was able to get to the squeaker. So,....my two cents,...Kong rubber toys are great but these soft plush ones are not anywhere as durable if you have a dog like mine. My dog is a very cute shichon lap dog so I didn't think he would be able to destroy it,...but he did."
5,"Good for a comfort item, fetch","These will not be great for dogs who are especially destructive, or rough on their toys, especially those who've been taught to destroy plush animals. It is great for calmer dogs who just want to fetch, play gently, or want a ""snuggly"" (yes, my dogs are a bit odd)."
5,19 months sober,"Having been a ""social"" drinker since age 20, my dependency on alcohol crept up on me; not until I realized my relationships were going downhill(friends as well as spouse) did I try to cut back drinking---not very successful so I decided to research my condition. This book was full of inforrmation I needed; I didn't change my diet that drastically but relied on the nutitional supplements which I still take altho not all of them or as many anymore. Not sure I could have done it alone."
2,Not Built to Last,"I purchased the sport series pop up canopy. Within 6 months the medium green top had faded to a washed out green - the top had been ripped apart by wind and the frame bent. Shelter Logic informs me a replacement top will be $90 and their pop up canopies are not meant to be left up. So, this if fine as a temporary shade, totally useless if there's wind and it is not intended to be left up permanently, nor is it warrantied for that. A side note, the Shelter Logic sales guy I contacted regarding a replacement canopy was passive aggressive and bordering on rude. Terrible company and a very average expensive product"
3,Review for ShelterLogic Sport Series Canopy,"If I could go back in time, I wouldn't have purchased this canopy. It's sturdy and seems durable but it's NOT made for 1 person to set up. You definitely need 2 people and since there's just me, it was a waste of my money. I would recommend this only if you always have a friend available to help you."
2,"""Corn - the return""","No, this movie's a bomb. The first one was quite good. 'The Return' is a sloppy sentimental mess without any of the discovery or charm of the first. Yes, we return to the issue of 'is it worth leaving this world of sickness, old age and eventual death for a world where people don't seem to be as readily accessable to those maladies"". The science fiction element is almost only a side note in comparison to all the corny family scenes where the characters of the original movie must decide once again whether or not to stay or go. I'm surprised I even finished it."
3,Lacks the magic of the first one,Seems to be one of those movies made just to cash in on the success of the first one.
2,Bulb burn really hot and burn out quickly,The puck gets really hot and the bulbs burn out quickly.I can't find replacements for less than $5-7 a piece
4,Solid Material.. Even for an indie group.,"This CD is surprisingly well put together. Nice solid songwriting here and catchy melodies to boot. These guys have some serious future racked up in Evolution. I borrowed a friend's copy, and I think I need my own. Get it!!!"
4,not as pictured?,I didnt get all these games when i ordered it but a few came in the pack i got with additional ones (was probably sent the wrong one) but I love it and the games that are previewed here that i got are loved as well. my daughter is learning alot from this
5,Awesome fun!,"I love these dice! I use these in my high school classroom to play games. Students LOVE rolling these. In addition, if they get a little competitive and try to nail each other with one of these, they can't hurt anybody. Ha.The only drawback is that the first ones only lasted a couple years. Students start picking at the foam ... and soon they're pretty trashed. However ... for the fun ... totally worth it."
4,"Embarrassing, but Milla's in it, so who cares?","As a guy, you might think it odd that I would watch such a film, and frankly I'm embarrassed by the fact that I did watch it. However, as a Milla obsessed fool, I couldn't pass it up. In the end I'm glad I watched it. Yeah, it's corny, and has pretty poor acting, however, Milla looked great, and her acting, as well as the acting of Brian Krause, improved drastically throughout the film. This is the perfect film for any Milla Jovovich fan, because it showed how she has matured and improved as an actress.Viewer Beware:Just as the acting gets better, and you think the corniness has settled down a bit, they throw a giant hunk of cheddar your way. To say that the ending is cheesy is an understatement.Well, in the end, the movie is cheesy, yes, but if you're a Milla fan, check it out ASAP! However, because of the sometimes-corny acting, and all out teenage-female premise, I'm unable to score this above a 4 out of 5."
1,Fast forward review,"Flicks like this (for sleaze fans) fall into the underage perversion category, jailbait, lolitas, that sort of thing. I'm not sure how old Milla was here, but the point is whether she pulls off the feeling of being sixteen, and the answer is yes. Of course, there's no point if there's no nudity, but there is, briefly.First we got some topless tyke running around, but boy, that stretches the definition in pretty much unacceptable territory. Anyway, it's brief. Then we got a lot of swimming and skimpy costumes (mucho legs and tummy) by the older Milla, but nowhere near as explicit as BG I. Finally, we got a uni-nip mirror scene. That's it, you can stop watching at that point and save wear and tear on your fast forward button. One star for the one nip, max."
3,A little tedious and lacking in mathematical scope.,"This is a wordy, somewhat tedious rendition of living and social conditions in South India and England pre-WW I and is lacking in sufficient explanation of Ramanujan's mathematical contributions. It would have been helpful if Kanigel had shortened the book and given more insight into Ramanujan's math contributions instead of merely endlessly citing effusive praise about him by Hardy and others."
4,very interesting bio,I like their books & I saw the movie so I wanted to read their bio's & it is very interesting
4,An inside look at film design at its best,"This book is a must have for all serious Star Wars fans or anyone interested in film design. The book chronicles the design evolutions of all the major characters, vehicles, sets and props that were integral to the storytelling in The Phantom Menace. Star Wars fans will no doubt enjoy the 'what-could-have-beens' implied by the illustrations and discussions."
1,Beware this is the 44 page excerpt book,"Sellers are using this page to sell a book that is actually titled: THE ART OF STAR WARS EPISODE I: an excerpt of the book written by Jonathan Bresman. The ISBN matches this work, which is only 44 pages in length and was given away with the purchase of a VHS version of the Phantom Menace. The way Amazon lists this book can be misleading because they refer to it as the paperback edition in the review which claims it is a massive volume with over 600 illustrations. They are actually referring to another edition of the book... the TRADE PAPERBACK EDITION. This error has caused me a lot of fuss with two of the used book traders here at Amazon. Know that you are not buying the 200+ page oversize work with this webpage."
3,A great story of businessman as protagonist,"Hawley follows the exploits of several businessman at a top company and the aftermath of their leader's death. The power struggles, personal ambitions, and future of these men are brought to life most vividly. A good period piece of 1950s business."
1,cliche ridden tripe,"Older reporters are ""grizzled veterans,"" younger ones are ""green,"" and sometimes the former First Daughter seems to be piling up so many cliches per sentence she could write today's politicians' speeches! Bah."
4,PullzAll,"This thing does exactly what you want it to do. The price I found on Amazon was by far the best with all other considerations in play.Call me 100% satisfied, the ""WARN"" brand still means something !!I will try to buy all my performance and ""more than average"" quality related purchases from Amazon first if I can."
3,attic hoist,"Installed for use as a hoist in the attic, for lifting heavy storage items through an access hatch.Pros: I like the versatility of the unit. It is lightweight and can be used for outside applications like pulling shrubs out, hoisting things in the garage, trees, etc. It performed well in the Attic application in lifting three window air conditioners that were stored for the winter.Cons: It is a bit slow. It is geared low, and overshoots when you release the trigger, making it difficult to come to an exact position. (not a big issue) I would have liked to have a cargo net available with the unit. I could not find one and had to build a small plywood platform with ropes attached in order to lift items into the attic. This works OK, but a net would be much easier."
2,It was nice,"We purchased this Pullzall two months ago, and have used it about 5 times. It has a nice ""overload/auto reset"" feature to stop you from damaging it. it just stops if it is above capacity and gives you a red warning light. That worked fine for a while, but on the 4th or 5th time it started flashing all the lights, then they all went out. It now no longer works. I wouldn't reccomend this tool if there is any chance you are going to be overloading it."
3,Excellent as far as it goes.,"As far as it goes it is outstanding but the vocabulary included is very brief. It is well illustrated and the definitions are well written so that a first grader can read and understand them. The problem is that because the book is limited to 1,000 words, for every word my child can find in the dictionary there are eight he cannot find. From that standpoint the book is not a good buy. If it were three times as big, it would be.This really a beginner's book, useful for advance First Grade and early Second Grade. As a parent the DK Children's Illustrated Dictionary which has over 5,000 words is useful for finding simple explanations of a word and it is the next step up for a student. Also recommend having the Merriam Webster DK Children's Dictionary, a large hard back also useful to parents and the next step up. Both cost less than $14 and are a good investment."
5,Great Sink,This sink arrived in perfect condition and is a great bathroom sink. It is very deep and works much better than traditional shallow sinks.
4,"Great Bra, great minimizer","The bra fits perfectly and does exactly what it says it does, minimizes seamlessly. It's also quite comfortable compared to other minimizers out there. My only complaint is that there isn't much lift to the bra, but I would still buy it again and plan to soon because the good outweighs the bad."
2,great bra...strange noise,"I am a big fan of Chantelle bras--but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move. Strangest bra I have ever owned...it fits well, but I don't wear it much because of the noise?? Anyone else have this problem? All my other Chantelle bras are great."
2,Not That Fun,i didnt find tak and th epower of juju very fun! It gets to be really hard and you have to collect about a million things and gets really old really fast.
1,WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO REALY,THIS IS THE WORST GAME IVE EVERPLAYDTHEY MAKE YOU RUN AROUND AND: KILL PLANTS COLECT 200 OF THIS AND 200 OF THAT I BEAT THE GAME WITH CHEAT CODES AND IT STILL WASINT FUN!!!THIS IS SOPOUSE TO BE RPG NO THIS IS CRAP!!!!\FIRST THQ CANCELS BATTLE BOTS NOW THIS
1,No way!,".How can this be a 5 star game. No way! It's stupid!! I've had it for 2 days and i'm already getting bored of it. The movies are ok, but the game play is boring, and most of the jokes are really corny. Spend your money on a different game, seriously."
2,Ouch! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!,"I'm a person who like to find redeeming features with anything. This was really hard.. I like offbeat stuff, stuff on filmmaking, etc.. But this was....Words do not come to express the negative, boredom, and darkness and where are you going with this... (oh! No where!)..Umm.. something really good is ""FilmSchool"" Its about a bunch of trainwrecks too.. but at least watching those people suffer didn't make me suffer.. it actually entertained."
4,GREAT book.,"This book is an absolute classic that, if you haven't read, will open up your mind to new possibilities (while entertaining you at the same time).This is a well formatted version of the book. Easy to read with the illustrations (mostly) intact. That being said, I'd get the physical version of the book over this, but if you prefer eBooks, this is a good one to go with.Recommended."
4,Why is this movie like U-571?,"There was a lot of flak about _U-571_ because that movie fictionalizes the seizure of an ENIGMA machine from a U-boat... combining two real events involving BRITISH sailors and ships (the capture of the U-505 being almost irrelevant to the ENIGMA story).No (previous) reviewer had mentioned that _The Enemy Below_ is based on a novel of the same name ... involving a BRITISH destroyer hunting a U-boat. The movie tracks very well with that novel, other than some cultural changes for the US crew of the US ship. Therefore I think that Leonard Maltin may have it wrong when he says this is essentially a remake of a 1930's movie. I believe it really is an Americanization of the (early 1950s) British novel.Yes, the (original) _Star Trek_ episode ""Balance of Terror"" is based on this movie. Both are gripping and suspenseful, and have memorable moments."
4,Submarine,I like to watch sea adventures particularly submarine films. In my own opinion I suggest those who like naval submarine warfare to buy this film. There are some thrilling scenes interplayed by a destroyer cahsing a submarine and the submarine chasing the destroyer. The submarine firing torpedos and the destroyer sprawling depth charges. The irony of this film is when both captains have to abandon their destroyed vessels respectively and the enemy 'below' and 'above' are juxtaposed and seem to become reconcilable. In my own opinion I think that the message of the last scenes is a good message that both enemies suffer as humans and both parties desrve dignity.
5,Outstanding,"As are all movies regarding the "" Silent Service"". I even loved ""Dass Boot"" rven though I do not speak German, so had difficultywith the rhetoric."
4,"Tony, You Stud!","Tony Randall gets to play a surprisingly virile everyman caught up in classic Sixties spy intrigue. His leading lady is the ubiquitous sexy female spy, Senta Berger. The cast is full of those guys you used to see in just about everything back then: Terry-Thomas, for one. So it's like a big reunion for those of us who thrived on every spy movie while waiting for the next James Bond to come out. This reminded me of what a versatile and enjoyable actor Mr. Randall was back in his heyday. Spyjinks ensue as Tony and Senta narrowly escape danger in ways a cut above spoofs like Matt Helm. Unfortunately, the VHS is faded and soft. I would love to see this movie in a sharp DVD format."
2,A Disappointment,"My son asked for this game because he likes the TV program. He was disappointed after playing it for a few minutes. It didn't compare well to Tak and the Power of JuJu, which he already had. He found it apparently isn't possible to save a game while exiting, although there is a menu item for loading a saved game. The little ""user manual"" wasn't any help. We wouldn't have bought it if we'd known what we do now."
3,"great for situps, bad for anything else","I received this mat and loved it at first, mostly because I just used to for only situps. But now I have moved on to doing yoga and exercises involving motions and this mat does not cut it. Through every move in yoga or motions this mat stretches out from underneath of you and you lose your pose and then get bad form from it. Another problem that I have with this mat is that if you get the smallest tear possible in it, it will continue stretching and tearing more and more. So my final though is just get it for only using it to do situps or an exercise required no motions at all."
3,Everlast roll up mat,"Product was shipped from Amazon out of Reno, Nv. UPS pulled up and I walked out to receive my purchase. I found the driver wildly taping up avery large, crushed box. Took the box into my house and opened it. I found the box to be approximately 3 times larger than the size required. Box contained no packing material. The mat itself is a very attractive design and is contained in a fishnet bag with draw string. This is my first exercise mat and I find that it is not wide enough (24""). Moreover, I find myself worrying about how long the foam/sponge material is going to hold up. Width and material type were presented in ""product description"", so I was forwarned. I also find that the shock absorbing quality of the foam is hardly apparant. There are a number of larger, vinyl covered mats availabe from Amazon, and if I had it to do over againI would have chosen from that group."
4,What was promised!,This ended up being a nice 'package' of products that folds up nicely back into the pack after it is used. The cords look very study and the speaker stands fit my Fender nicely. Good deal...
2,Rough materials - not expected quality from purchasing other Chicago Metallic products,"I just received this - counted the disks right away and was happy to have all the disks. The pan looks like it has been handled roughly when being made or it has been used. The bags packed in were not sealed, so who knows. I have not used it yet - but will in this New Year's week. I also have read these take a lot of care not to rust. I will update this after using, but the rough physical appearance of the product was disappointing."
4,It's so easy,I recieved this item faster than the date give. The first time using this brought a tear to my eye. It was so easy that a child could use it.
2,Could be much better,"Kischer's book is seven interviews with old Japan hands, which conceptually sounds fantastic. Anyone who has lived in such an interesting country for as long as these men have (why are all the interviewees male?) should have some very valuable insights. While Kischer's sample may be quite credible and qualified, they are also rather boring on the whole. They worked in Japan, for a long long time, and that's pretty much it. I found only two interviews to be worth reading - Donald Richie's and Kischer's own interview (done by another journalist). Given the massive differences in male-female roles that apply even to foreigners, Kischer's failure to talk with women about their lives in Japan is disappointing."
2,"Uneven, not worth it","An uneven collection, with many kid, or coming of age stories. The stories vary in how polished they are, some seem like early drafts. There are a couple of good stories, Mary Gaitskill's Today I'm Yours comes to mind. The collection reads like the result of a committee selection process, nothing too interesting or different has been included. I'd recommend another collection, such as Best of Tin House."
5,Short Stories are very entertaining!,"At first, I did not know what to expect with this compilation. Once I started into it, I found it very entertaining and diverse. Great for those 30 minutes that you want to read something but not a long novel. I've already purchased the 2007 compilation and am enjoying it."
5,JUST WHAT I WANTED,"Ordered 2 bottles, can not sleep without misting the linens, the Lavender Water takes the place of Ambien!! Came in short time and am pleased with my purchase"
3,THE BOOK IS GOOD,THE SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS ARE NOT POSSIBLE TO SEE THE DETAILS OF THE TECHNIQUE. IT SEEMS THAT THE TECHNIQUES ARE OF DIFFICULT APPLICATION. MORE IT IS A GOOD BOOK WILL COUNT IMPORTANT TECHNIQUES
3,"It is OK, I think it is not always fair",(I'm typing for my 7 year-old son)I think that it is not fair that the AI players always land on the top level and jump over my car. And I'm a good driver and it is hard to win.
1,Stinks on ice!,"Not the product, it's not such a smart buy, I wanted ""Micro Sized usb extensions"", I guess next time I'll order ""Jumbo Shrimp"" from not so smart buy and yes I'll look at the picture!"
3,Gentrify New Orleans,"Everyone in New Orleans needs to read this book. A tad academic, it is, but his points are valid. Preservationists need to understand that decaying buildings are not historical or the 'fabric' of the community, they are blight. If money does not exist in the community, and if there is not interest from outside within a defind period of time (three years, I propose) then razing the building is acceptable. Vacancy and blight are just as bad an evil as yuppies moving in to bring Starbucks and Walmart (only the new, urban version of their stores) to the old 'hood. It is amoral to force the indiginous inhabitants to live in a blighted area just because it ""used to be"" a place of substance or have some historical standing. I mean this in the sense of social history as well as with historical events. New Orleans: ""bring on the chains"" because the city is not getting any better with the local citizenry doing there part, or lack thereof!"
5,Blues-Rock Guitar,"Coen Wolters Band has a great Blues-Rock sound, with fine guitar, bass, and percussion. Guitar style is similar to a wide range of better known blues/rock artists: Jimi Hendrix, Coco Montoya, Michael Burks, Joe Bonamassa, and Leslie West, to name a few. Wolters Band has a new CD release (May 2006) called ""As The Crow Flies"" that is perhaps a bit better than ""Broken Glass."" If unavailable via Amazon.com, go to Coen Wolter's web site where you can purchase a copy."
2,Good But Not That Good.,"Mariachi Los Caporales is a pretty good group and I can't wait to see what they do with Manuel Vargas. But as far as this cd goes, its just another one for the collection. It is a good one to add to the stake, but if you're a first time buyer go with Sol de Mexico, Cobre, or if you know what you're listening to, the best in the world: MARIACHI VARGAS DE TECALITLAN."
5,Yummy way to prepare them,These are a new favorite. They are in a local store and I always buy a jar when I am out to be sure I am always stocked up just in case (god forbid) they stop carrying them! I stuff them with herbed goat cheese and then drizzle the tinyest bit of honey on the entire plate when I am done. They are awesome!!!!!!
5,brilliant,i cant stop playing this cd. Life through the lens was good but this is much much better. It would seem that Robbie is really developing and discovering his own style. This is guaranteed to be a classic.
5,Excellent Lyrical and Musical Album with Style,"Williams hit European MTV with flair. His latest album, I've Been Expecting You, is no different. The UK and Europe has known about this artist for years yet he still rates ""Import"" here in the U.S. That needs to change. Purchase the CD - You will not regret it for minute."
4,robbie,This is a great album. If you like Robbie then buy it - you won't be disappointed. There's a real mixture of ballards like the piano led 'she's the one' as well as the more catchy pop tracks. Look out for the two hidden tracks at the end. Fast forward and you'll find them!
5,One of the greatest American films,"Having seen this in the early 70s, I recently found out that my wife had never seen it. Seeing it again was an incredible experience. It is, without a doubt, one of the finest films ever done in America. Script, Cast, Location, film technique, editing, and also the great soundtrack, it's as perfect as it can be. It's stronger now (for me at least) than I remember it being for me in 71. It seems to have aged extremely well. To put it in perspective, it is to me now what Gone With The Wind would have been to me in 1971, in terms of an old film being seen again. But this has most definitely become better with time, which I can't say about Gone with the Wind. It's almost a documentary, but with a great storyline, of a time and place that doesn't exist anymore. Just do yourself a favor and either buy a copy of this director's cut for you library, or rent it. You won't regret it."
4,Very Informitive,I thought this book was very informitive. I am planning to visit Antietam and this gave me an idea of what the men had went through. I got such a vivid picture of the battle in my mind that I felt that I was there.
5,I really loved it!,"It went into great details about what happened, and more importantly why Anteitam happened."
5,awesome game,bought this game as a gift for my nephew; perfect way to get him into platform games and a funny one at that.
4,Tak is great for kids,"I picked up this game for my son and was very pleased with it. It wasn't very violent and the graphics were great. Plus it didn't have the annoying music that so many other games have. I played this one and although it was very easy for me to beat, my son will enjoy the challenge of it."
5,very happy the alternate blues,I was very happy to find this album on cd. I had it already on an lp. for a long time and could not play it anymore because I sold my old radiosystem
5,"Waking the Dead, finally in the US","I fell in love with this show on BBCAmerica and waited not so patiently for it to come out on Region 1 DVD.Well worth the price I paid, just wish it had some extras, cast interviews, behind the scenes look, etc."
3,Appalling chop-job to good movie,"I remember watching this movie as a teenager two decades ago and loving it, but could not recall exact scenes or lines. Recently, after reading the Amazon customer reviews about the difference between the original VHS movie and the edited ""Feature Films for Families"" DVD, I actually bought them both to compare. I must say I agree with the people who were aghast at how much of the original had been cut out. I was particularly astonished to see that parts that were completely ""family appropriate"" - such as Kathy's exchange about hockey with her mother's date at the dinner table - were snipped. WHY? It made Kathy's darting from the table seem like a complete and confusing overreaction.I can understand if ""Feature Films for Families"" wanted to remove the ""herpes"" comment and the scene involving underage drinking. But they tinkered all over the place. How does a film company obtain permission to (essentially) kidnap a movie and butcher it like this??"
2,Was a wonderful movie before it was all chopped up for this DVD,I remember watching this when it came out. It was such a great movie. Don't buy this DVD. All the humor was taken out and it was left boring and disjointed. Most of the really cute parts are completely gone! Not worth the money. I hope they put the original version out on DVD someday. It really was a great story.
2,If lifetime made a hockey movie,its an ok movie but too much like a lifetime orignal movie. the only show one hockey game. they show the crowd and play the star spangled bannger and o cananda but you never see them play the final game. if they was more hockey in it the movie would be better.
5,Blackheads and breakouts begin to disappear!,"I feel that the overall quality of my skin texture has improved since i started using this produce 3 months ago. I use it at night, but I will do some mornings too if I feel my face could use it. I am a 25 year old female and I have breakouts and lesions in my skin. I also get blackheads. Salycic Acid and Benzoyl peroxide are both a bit drying and this one leaves me feeling a bit dewy after I put on some lotion."
3,easy to use,"this is a good buy and was easy to install with the supplied wire diagram. This harness IS missing the required ground wire to make a completly seamless swap, but I am looking for the extra wire at another stereo dealer to keep me from having a ""wild"" ground wire that does not lock into the harness."
1,Not what I expected,It's a great idae for a gag toy. But I didn't find it to be very authentic in the sensethe farts sound like a big fan instead of actual farts. Plus the sounds are randomly generatedwhich is also a disappointment.
2,Definitely no page turner...,"I have to agree with C. Everett's review on this one and I see we're definitely not the majority. Unlike her, I did manage to finish it-how I don't know-it was a struggle to keep turning the pages. Carly was naive, immature and cold and grinded me from the very beginning and Hank, trying to be an honorable guy, instead turned into a shmuck. I found it hard to believe that mere days after sleeping with him, she knew she was pregnant. She was a real dink to Hank for what happened in the truck and wouldn't accept her own responsibility until the book was nearly finished. He spends most of the book blaming himself for what happens to her and she spends just as much time blaming him. However, Anderson is a good author and she has written some great books. This just wasn't one of them."
2,VERY Disappointed in this one!,"One of the authors that I never miss a book from but was really disappointed in this one.CORNY dialogue and stiff, unbelieveable charectors made this book a real disappointment from this usually great author. People don't really talk like this...especially a ""cowboy"" and if I would have had to read the term ""visual cortex"" one more time, I would have screamed! I think we got the idea after the first 10 times she mentioned it."
2,a real disappointment,"I've read all of Catherine Anderson's books, and by now I can practically write her plots for her. All of her characters are interchangeable, the women are completely helpless (although they are supposed to be strong and independent). But this book takes the cake. While I applaud the author for her use of disabled people, the writing for these two characters drove me insane. Everyone controlled Carly's life, and inbetween ridiculous conversations about why Carly had to live in an unsafe environment through which she could not navigate, we get the doctor's conversations full of medical jargon. This could have been SO much better."
3,Lovely book.,I indeed like most of Jude Deveraux books. And this one is like most of them. They are joyable to read and keep one in nice world while reading it.
3,A suggestion for your study plan,"While I easily passed the exam using only this book and brainbuzz.com's free study notes, there were topics on the exam not covered in the book. If your're aiming for an MCSE, I suggest you study all four of the core study guides, and then take the tests. Microsoft has acknowledged the interdependence of the tests in offical training, where the four classes don't correspond one-to-one to the four exams. These books don't either."
3,Still reading,Not finished yet. Will hope to do so in the fullness of time.Trying to add more words but cannot think of more.
2,Nothing more than a good plot gone bad.,"I picked this book up as a choice for my summer reading list. With the most interesting plot revealed in the summary and my interest in WWII, I chose it over the others. I was disappointed.The plot carries out relatively smoothly but with far too many changes in direction, switching point of views more often than necessary. The character's personalities are well-established, I'll give it that.But the point when this story picked up was in the last 80 pages or so; way too late for me to still be interested. At page 275 or so, I got interested in the book more, only to be thrown for a loop when I got to the ending. That ending was one of the most disappointing I've read in a long time. The revelation at the end, which was not straight out given to you, ruined a good portion of that book for me.Disappointing. Definitely not something I'd consider a good book."
2,Overrated. Decent story but not a thriller,"After reading Robert Wilson's ""Company of Strangers"", and really enjoying it, I sought out another WWII thriller book and came across the Higgin series. I choose this book because supposedly it is his best.I was completely underwhelmed. I found the pacing slow and boring. Little character development and I honestly didn't care who died and who didn't.There was little emotion and it all seemed a bit too much like a story being told, but I wasn't in the story."
4,"Great story, possibly best war time book","The possiblity that this actually happened adds to the effect, great characterisation, mix of backgrounds - wonderfull read, pity most of his other books seem to be rushed formulaic thrillers."
3,I guess you get what you pay for,"Some posts on the Explorer forum recommended this is as close to factory ride. I don't know what they factory ride was like since I bought it used but I don't think Explorers would have been as popular if they rode like this. To be fair, the truck has over 200k miles so other things in the suspension are past their prime, and it did eliminate the total wallowing the truck was doing on its utterly shot shocks, but I would have figured on something a bit more firm. I'd never have bought such cheap shocks except for the truck's age and it not being driven much anymore. If I had a younger truck I'd definitely spend more and get a higher grade product."
3,Not as thrilled as I had hoped,"Since I do mainly jewelry, this book for me was not what I was looking for.. It does contain a lot of good information, fusing times, tools and projects.Pluses is that the photos are in color.Good book if you want to do larger type pieces and slumping."
4,One of my favorites!,"An absolutely wonderful lotion, the scent is very reminiscent of lemon poundcake. The scent is present, but not overwhelming, and fades to nothing after a few hours.While not greasy, it does sit on my skin for a few minutes before fully absorbing, but doesn't get in the way of everyday activities."
5,One of the best films ever,Funny.lots of humor.Very entertaining.Nice old airplanes.One of the best films everhighly recommended
4,Flight or something like it,Fun Family movie. Love the Red Skelton cameo's. Red Skelton could say more with facial expressions than all the politicians say in thier endless speeches.
4,gift for my son-in-law,"I bought for my son-in-law, at his request. It will be easy to wrap, as well as economical to mail to him."
5,One of the RARE Classics,"This is a great movie for airplane buffs and those who enjoy comedy. The filming and stunts are amazing. To think this was the beginning of aviation. A must see for anyone who appreciates comedy and/or aviation. A family favorite at my house, one we view over and over. The laughs never seem to stop."
2,Not Functional,I haven't been able to watch the movie as it is set for regional 1 and I am in regional 4.
4,Magnificent DVD - but not for Europe,"This was an old movie, but a very fine DVD - A good lot of intellligent humor and very exciting for see all those old flying machines in action. I had problems with the replay in my DVD/TAPE machine connected to my TV. Iguess it is because this DVD was for sale in North America and Mexico only and not in Europe (Denmark).I used my computer instead (Windows XP with Media Center) and I succeeded.Regards Flemming"
5,"I've tried all the others, This one is the BEST!","The people who don't know anything are saying this battery is no good. Well try and show me one that lasts longer. There is not. This Kodak CRV3 (NON RE-CHARGEABLE) is the best and longest lasting there is, period.Now don't get this confused with the 're chargeable' ones.No one seems to sell a re chargeable crv3 that lasts hardly at all.I went to the Manufacturers site and looked up the specs on the 'amp hour capacity' and the rechargeables don't even come close. So yeah you can buy a rechargeable thinking you are going to save some money ,but when you are out in the mountains and you find the perfect shot your battery is going to be dead.So just buy this one and you will be able to take 5x's more pic's ,,,easily."
1,Why do you confuse to consumer?,"I ordered Kodak Max CRV3..........I recieved Energizer CRV3.these batteries are not the same and do not last as long I wish to get what I ordered!!!!And then it is more than importat that not a CRV3 Lithium Rechargeable battery but a Lithium disposable.Amazon associates this product with ""What others buy"" and includes battery chargers. The seller and the product description should clearly state that it is not rechargeable.After I received this item, I was very angry."
1,Not Happy!,"I recently purchased two of these for my Kodak Z1085 IS. The product indicates 300-650 digital pictures can be taken with each battery. Not true! I hardly got 150 pictures before it died. I was in England and had to purchase Lithium batteries at quite an expense (pounds vs.dollars). Also I was not using the camera features excessively (zooming, reviewing, deleting). These Kodak batteries are expensive and NOT WORTH THE PRICE!"
5,Great Value,"Bought a genuine Kodack replacment battery for my camera more cheaply than most generic batteries. Great value, the battery was as advertised and I am very satisfyed with the service and this vendor."
2,Good for about $8,"At the time, it was $40.00 on Pre-Order. We pre-ordered. I got it. I looked at the graphics and talking animation. Bad. The developers didn't work very hard. It's totally easy. Graphics and the noises, everything fairly bad. No 2003 graphics. Rather 1998 graphics. Not so bad, but not really recommended."
1,timmy's a butthead,"I saw this game at some's house.crap is what it was.You have to wait to wish for cruddy stuff (not to mentio the graphics).I'd avoid this game.This should be called Superly retarded poopheads.I'm not a good writer, but you get my point.If you want to pay something fun, play ratchet and clank, jak and daxter,prince of persia,grand theft auto,metal slug,mechassualt, or halo.Just don't buy fairly odd parents."
5,FUN FUN,a great game for any buyer.......if ur lookin for a game to buy this is the one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
5,Almost a Post-Punk Masterpiece,"Some of these songs, sound just ok on first listen. But the more you listen it to, the more you become absorbed in it. At least I did. Stand out tracks are:The Drive (too short!)Shining HoursSpectators Of LifeTokyo Twilight (My Favorite)Also included are a couple live songs. Apparently these songs were never recorded in the studio. Sound quality varies. One song in particular ""Burn"" sounds like it would have been fantastic. If only! ""Other Enquiries"" sounds great too.So I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 due to frustration on the quality of the live tracks.Be sure to check out their only album release ""Swimming + Singles"". Also they have another album under a different band name from when they regrouped in the 90's. I haven't gotten a chance to listen to it much; it's a rare cd called Night Vision (and they renamed themselves Jazz)."
3,Average Result,"I purchased it because my skin got ichy when the weather becomes hot.It did work. However, it burned little bit of my skin. Part of my skin got red andit took few days until it got recovered. I do have sensitive skin so maybe that is why.I have not re purchased it after that but still think there is some use for this product."
3,A tragedy,"A sad coming of age story that follows a fifteen year old girl struggling with a number of life's early decisions. Well written, poignant, moving in places, it chronicles well the problems that many kids face today: growing up without a moral compass. There's a lesson to be learned from the book, though I think the lesson is unintended by the author and also think those who could benefit most will probably miss it completely. If you read this book, look beyond the surface; in reality this book is a tragedy."
4,Eclectic characters on a bittersweet canvas.,"This story is told from the perspective of a 15 year-old daughter of atheist parents who move to a new house every year so her father has new landscapes to paint. In her 15th year, Tamara befriends the Baptists who live in the tar-papered house across the street from their newest neighbors and does her best to find a god she so badly wants to believe in. The characters are compelling and the story paints it's own landscape of a family separated by their private needs. Poignant telling. I was moved. I think you will be too."
3,Elisa is the star.,"Nearly all the standout songs (""Sigue El Camino,"" ""Lo Sé,"" ""Es Amor"") are sung by Elisa Brizuela, who unfortunately is often relegated to the background on this promising album. The CD keeps an uptempo pace, and some care has obviously been put into crafting interesting melodies and eclectic arrangements. And unlike many party-oriented bands, their ballads are more than just afterthoughts, as ""Corazón Herido"" and ""Lo Sé"" ably demonstrate. As for Brizuela, she has the voice to lead any group she wants, but the same can't be said about her two male co-lead-vocalists. If the group doesn't make better use of her, it would be hard to blame her if she looked for her own ""libertad."""
5,I truly enjoyed this novel--what a refreshing change!,"Single Man Screaming is definitely different than the norm. It touched on many different issues facing black men and women and caused me to do some soul searching of my own. I was truly inspired by the strong conviction of Terry, the main character, and it was refreshing to read about a strong black man with a true spiritual relationship with God. I also enjoyed the inspirations that accompanied each chapter. As a single black woman, I remember the relationship ""games"" all too well and I particularly enjoyed the Inspiration titled ""Game Time"". This novel was enlightening, inspiring and entertaining. As a member of a book club, we've read a number of books by black men and this was a refreshing change--entertaining without all the cursing and sex. I truly enjoyed this novel--can't wait to read the next one!"
4,read it in the 80's,"yes its outdated bc it was written in 1975, but would you consider Casablanca or Hamlet outdated? put yourself in that era and this book was quite racy for its time. as a woman, i appreciated the chapter where he explains the mans sensation during sex."
1,Duuumb,"This game is dumb, don't waste your money get Sonic Heroes. On spongebob all you do is run around as a sponge named Spongebob( what kind of name is that anyway) anyway all you do is run around solving dumb elements and usless plots. Its just a stupid game copying off of a dumb show. This is a dumb game don't buy it if you do buy it for your little kids, it would make a bad present for a 12 year old. I mean a talking sponge what the heck!"
1,Wrong photo!,The photo is not the product being sold. This one is only for pain relief (i.e. the red cap) and not the anti-inflammatory & analgesic (blue cap)
2,Traumeel for Plantar Fasciitis,"I purchased this because I got rave reviews from a friend who used it on her wrist when she had a carpal tunnel flare up. Since I have been dealing with plantar fasciitis for more than 2 years, I was ready to try anything. I used the product twice a day for 3 weeks, rotating applications with Sombra Heat Therapy. Unfortunately, it did not seem to make a difference."
1,Ragweed allergy beware!!!,"I was very excited about this product based on the reviews I have read. I was hoping to treat my running overuse injury with herbal ingredients. However, after applying the creme to my aching foot soles I broke out hives on my ENTIRE body that lasted for HOURS! I have since been informed that people who have allergens to ragweed might develop reactions. I would definitely be cautious and would advise people not to use this product if you have allergens to flowers, plants, or trees.If I could give this item anything less than one star I would.... Only because I thought I was going to die of an allergic reaction."
2,traumeel,"I had very high hopes for this product, but found it to be no better than what I had been using (Blue-emu). Cost was same but no relief."
5,Great shears!,"I love these shears. The old kitchen shears I had were so dull I had to almost chop through bags, packages, whatever I was opening. The Henckels shears are extremely sharp & cut through everything with ease. But, what I like as much as the sharpness are the large handles. I have arthritis with swollen joints in my fingers, but they fit easily into the holes in the handle. Even if the price seems high, I'd recommend these to anyone. You get what you pay for."
2,WE Will Never Forget!!,"I am so horrified by this movie that I cannot watch it! I saw it when I was a kid and liked it. But looking at it now, it makes me so upset!Just look at the cover! Doesn't it look like the World Trade Center just after the planes smashed into them? Yeah, I know it's just 1 building, but the angle of the building is just creepy!! Okay, the movie was good; lots of blood and swear words, but I just can't get the images of the Twin Towers falling down like a building collapsing with explosives!! They should have a warning on the cover, saying something like:THIS IS NOT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER ON FIRE! THIS IS ONLY A MOVIE!I would like the movie more if they changed the box. But as it is, I can't watch it!!"
4,only 2 hostages shot!,This film is about an off-duty cop that goes to Los Angeles to see his wife but ends up running around the building with 12 terrorists after him. John McLaine(Bruce Willis) does actually get shot but you don't really notice it. I think it is very weird that only two hostages are shot. There is alot of cursing in it. But there are some hillarious jokes in it.
5,CLASSIC ACTION-THRILLER,"A powerful, action movie which keeps you in suspense throughout! Bruce Willis plays a cop who battles with terroists who have taken over the building where his wife and children are. The visual effects are stunning, dialogue fast and very sharp and as always a great, beleavable performance from Bruce Willis. Amongst the rest of the cast include bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alan Rickman and Paul Gleason. One of the best action movies i've seen. A definite classic! Highly recommended!!!!!"
2,Picture Pretty,"I bought this cookbook with great expectations and was quite disappointed. Fabulous photos, but not much for an experienced cook to sink your teeth into. Much is updates or variations on California Cuisine from 10 years ago. I found nothing novel, water-mouthering, or special. However, the photos are terrific and inspiring. Think of it as a food styling book and you won't be as disappointed as I was. I did give it away as a gift and my friend, an occassional cook, was overjoyed."
5,good book,"book is a book , if you were a fan of sammys, read it.... worth the time .!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!"
3,Does it's job,"This a decent speaker system for a small office, the sound is decent and the volume is dependent on the player itself so their's less fuss. However there is a distinctly poor design in a speaker that implys iPod friendliness. The my iPod nano doesn't align with the jack built into its alleged iPod Nano base, so I can't use it! It works fine overall (I'd advise investing in an adapter), but that was a real disappointment."
1,What a disappointment!!!,"I know I'm in the minority, but I found this book incredibly boring. The dialog was stilted and forced. It lacked suspense, was long winded and beyond unbelievable. The only thing I felt for any of the characters was pity - they appear in such a bad book. I got to page 81 and couldn't go any further. This is my first Catherine Coulter and it will be my last."
1,How did this get published?,"The biggest mystery here is: how did this tripe get published? The story is something like an English murder mystery, but it's completely undone by its cardboard characters, flat tone, halting pace, and randomly shifting points of view. Coulter sums up dialogue when she ought to let her characters speak, and sentences meander in tortured ways. Most disturbing is the omniscient point of view--a writing technique that went out of favor after the nineteenth century. She tells the reader what one character is thinking or feeling, then shifts to the thoughts and feelings of another character--all in the same paragraph. Besides being unnecessary and amateurish, it saps the suspense from the story and defeats reader empathy for the characters. After a few chapters I knew I was wasting my time and put it down, though I read a few pages at the end to find out if solution to the mystery was as predictable as I thought it would be. It was."
4,I loved this book,She is one of my favorite authors and I have enjoyed almost all of her books. This one keeps you on the edge of suspense. Definitely worth your time and money.
2,Joining the Minority,"I apologize for all you Coulter fans but OMG can just one of her FBI series books not follow the formula: Big strong FBI man meets damsel in distress and two weeks later decides he want to marry her and have babies? Ugh. I read these sorts of books for the suspense and the mystery which for the most part she does fairly well; however, it is so mired in the thinnest of sexual undertones that it can be hard not to discount the whole storyline."
2,Cardboard cutouts,"I finished the book because I had to see what happened, but I found it a disappointment. The plot was wildly improbable, the characters just cardboard cutouts. I guess I like something a little closer to reality, a little more believable, with some characters that feel real. Did you notice? Everyone was either incredibly wonderful or the epitome of evil. I'm taking Catherine Coulter off my list of authors to read."
5,read it!,first in a FANTASTIC series! Am waiting for book #17 of the series to be published. I HIGHLY recommend to all.
1,Every so often I come across a book & I gotta ask....,"Somebody actually got PAID for this? Is this supposed to be supsense? Question: Where's the suspense? This is my 1st Coulter novel & I'm really disappointed. Coulter relies too heavily on long passages of dialogue to tell the story and reveal character (personally I find that writing style not only annoying but ineffective). If u really want to read it, I recommend checking this one out at the public library but be sure to return it in time -- even a $0.25/day late fee would be too much for this dud."
3,"Eh, not so bad","I have read other Coulter books (the historical romance ""Bride"" series, having to do with the Sherbrooke family) and liked them well enough, so I figured I would give the FBI Series a try, since I like mysteries too. While this book wasn't horrible, it wasn't great either. It got off to a slow start and it never really had me frantically turning pages. I was surprised by some of the plot twists, but they still seemed a little contrived to me once I got to them. The characters had chemistry and it might be nice to revisit them in later books in the series. I would recommend this for summer reading, but not if you want a super-intriguing plot line. I will probably buy the second book ""The Maze"" because it stars Savich and a newcomer, Sherlock, but probably won't go any further into the series than that."
4,Good Low-End tripod,"For small, lightweight, pocket cameras, this is a decent tripod. And pretty handy for making panorama's.I use it for that, as well as a make-shift light stand. Be aware that it WILL move around and/or vibrate in a strong wind."
3,Great... for awhile.,"This tripod was great for its price... and for almost two months. However, if you want a tripod that you don't want to have to replace and you use your tripod more than a handful of times a year, you need to get a higher quality tripod. I used this tripod on a trip (nearly two months after purchase and use) and one of the pan heads broak off. This caused the tripod to rock forward if any weight was on it at all making the tripod unusable."
4,Worth a look...,I picked up this book at a tag sale not knowing Barbara Parker's work and was quickly enamored with it. Her characters are believable and the story line is engaging. No mushy stuff here.I quickly went online to look for the next in the series.Definately worth reading.
4,Try being on both sides of the law...,"Gail Connor wants to be a partner in her Miami law firm and puts in 80 hour weeks to prove she should be considered partner material. Of course, her life outside the law firm suffers... Her marriage, her relationship with her mother, her daughter... and then she's accused of murdering her younger sister!Barbar Parker gives a well-written story with just enough twists & turns to keep it exciting. I was almost finished reading before I thought I had it figured out. First in a series. I can hardly wait to get the next in the series!"
3,Suspicion of Innocence,"This is the first book I have read by Barbara Parker. Actually, I listened to it on cassette. I would've given this book 5 stars, because it was extremely well written and kept me interested to the very end. However, contrary to my beliefs, the writer referred to a character's two abortions in a way that would indicate this as being her choice of birth control. Also, the fact that the same character was two months pregnant at the time of death, but there was no indication of anyone being responsible for the death of the child. Okay, let's add fornication, adultery, pedophilia and masochism to the recipe and the book is not one I would own to read again or recommend to a friend. I enjoy a good mystery, but can do without these all to real sins in the world."
3,Very slow beginning,"I must admit I had a hard time staying with this one. I can only hope the rest of the series is more exciting. I did like the characters but hope that they get built up more in the coming books. The ending did pick up and the book finally got exciting, but to read through all of those pages to get to it was hard for me."
5,Good quality Trowel,"I purchased the Fiskars Trowel, transplanter and cultivator at a good price for a high quality product. Love them."
1,Broke during the first use,"The first time I used this trowel it broke in two! It snapped where the blade attaches to the handle. It looks like it is solid metal entering the handle but it's actually hollow, filled with something gritty that resembles cement. I expected much better from Fiskars. I ended up buying a Craftsman trowel from Sears which is much better quality and was no more expensive than the Fiskars.Update: Well, after several uses, my Craftsman trowel ended up breaking as well. It seems Craftsman quality isn't what it used to be. Not to be beaten, I then purchased the Rumford Gardener Garden Pro Trowel from Amazon and after a lot of use it has performed perfectly!"
5,Great overview of several obscure wars,"We've all read books and seen TV documentaries about the Vietnam and Korean Wars. What I found interesting in Moran's ""Wars of National Liberation"" were the smaller, non-American wars that I wouldn't ever think of reading an entire book about. Think these wars were insignificant? Moran weaves them all into the familiar history of the Cold War and explains their impact on the 20th Century. Read about Mao's China, the French experience in Vietnam, the French in Algeria, the British departure from India and the creation of Pakistan, the continent-wide problems of Africa and South America, and the three Arab-Israeli wars. The photos are numerous and interesting and the maps superb. The book also includes a chronology from 1945 to 1975 leading to these wars as well as brief biographies of the key players in each conflict. All-in-all a great introduction to several conflicts that you may end up wanting to learn more about."
2,elementary introduction,"nice pictures, no remarkable insights. very short chapters on various wars. perhaps the best thing about the book is the bibliography."
4,Great buy!,"My daughter loves this toy, she is 13 months old. Everything goes in her mouth and the letters are to big to swallow. She loves playing with them on the fridge while I am making dinner!"
5,Great precursor to reading,"We bought 2 sets of lower case and one set of upper case letters and love them. We painted a wall with chalkboard paint and added the magnet additive so the letters would stick to the wall. It's been great fun! My 5-year-old uses the letters to practice words she's learning to read at school and to make new words and ""write"" whole sentences. Then we ""write"" sentences for her to read -- instructions for tasks she's to perform, clues to surprises, fill in the blanks with chalk, etc. Even my 18-mos-old twin sons are getting into the act."
4,Armstrong Handles a Tough Topic,"Not only was Karen Armstrong a nun for seven years, but she also teaches college courses on middle eastern history and Islam. She has brought a wonderful collection of history and religion together to illuminate this often tempest-tossed area of the world. Her analysis is effective for the non-historian to understand the political and religions factions of the Jerusalem conflict. Also, her analysis is sensitive enought to illuminate the struggle for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Anyone interested in comparative religion should read this book as well as Armstrong's others."
2,CD Version,"Regarding content: as an academic I can relate to experimental polemic, so I could live with the far out theses, but I'm rating this mainly on the narration. It was HORRIBLE. I recognize that we vary when it comes to pronunciation, but there are serious errors. It's really hard to listen when you repeatedly hear ""Samaria"" read as ""Samareena.""Hard to take the book seriously."
1,Biblically Inaccurate,"I was unable to finish this book because Karen Armstrong's Biblical references are so glaringly wrong. She has the God of the Old Testament splitting a sea monster in half during creation, and Isaiah telling King Ahaz that the Messiah will be his Queen's unborn son, just to name a few. I eventually came to the conclusion that if her Biblical references cannot be trusted, how can I trust that the rest of her research is correct as well? I don't know what Bible she was reading, but it wasn't the Judaic/Christian one!"
4,Cat Ballou,"I had to watch this movie for a History class, so I bought it. It turned out that I really enjoyed it! Good investment!"
1,AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE!,"I think Lee Marvin was a great actor, and I enjoyed his acting in another silly Western (Paint your wagon), but this is the most awful movie I've seen in a LONG time, and Marvin's acting doesn't save it because the director had him do and say really stupid things. I think Marvin must have been given an Oscar for this movie out of pity for having had to be in this miserable movie."
3,the greatest horse actor in the world,comical from start to finish even the parts that are not intended to be. Lee Marvin and the horse makes it a must see even with the dispicable ms.fonda in attendance
4,Cat Ballou,"One of the most enjoyable Western comedies out there. Lee Marvin's performances are a thing of beauty -- though his Kid Shelleen occasionally veers into the overly absurd. Jane Fonda is both poignant and very funny as the lead character who evolves from innocent young woman to criminal mastermind. Everyone is having a blast, but I also especially enjoyed Dwayne Hickman as Uncle Jed. And did you ever think you'd see Nat King Cole performing duets with Stubby Kaye? Well, this move has a lot of unexpected treats; I recommend it highly."
5,great condition!,This atlas provided all the information and was in great condition for something that is used; it seems like brand new. I didn't really use it for my class though but I'm glad I still have it. Great product for a great price. Would definitely recommend it for anyone who needs this and doesn't want to pay the 15 dollars+ in a college bookstore.
3,"Nice Book, but........","This was a nice book, but it did not live up to my expectations. The first chapters and the appendix are the best part of the book. I felt that there were too many chapters relating to projects and not much on the actual process and firing of PMC Also many of the pictures were duplicated from chapter to chapter. I do not think the editing and the publisher were very top rate. All in all it was an ok book, but I wish I had purchased Tim's Mc's book or another artists book. Sorry Maryann.........."
2,"Easily Jammed, Week Sping Action, Not Versatile","This was one of the first cutters I bought for the garden and has been the least successful. The blades easily jam, this is particularly frustrating when trimming suckers at the base of a tree and I pick up a stray wood chip. Part of the problem maybe due to defective workmanship or faulty design because the blades don't make a tight pass and can become easily clogged. It only worked trouble free for a month before I had to replace it with the Power Gear design from Fiskars, a dramatically better product!This might be good for medium duty branch trimming and nothing else, but otherwise I would look at the other Fiskar designs for a more trouble-free and versatile trimmer."
2,I had to return mine,I have owned many Fiskars products over the years and all of them have been of consistently high quality. Except for this one.The third time I used it the bolt on the floating axis on the lower lever popped out. I reattached it but on further inspection I determined that it will soon pop out again.What I think happened here is that somewhere in the manufacturing process somebody did not install all the parts they were supposed to. Otherwise this unit is of very high quality.I gave this two stars because if mine had all it's parts it would be the perfect lopper.
5,LONG lasting GREAT color!,"I have tried many, many different brands of long lasting lipstick and Lipfinity is by far the best!!! It lasts all day and all night and I love color #92!!!"
4,Without time for the next week tournament?,"This book is a fast read-understand book, almost based only in tactics it reviews the most important lines of the closed games, i enjoy playing with the Tschigorin defense and this book was very helpful giving me the basic idea and the basic main line, this book is for novices and if you want to surprise your opponent in the last minute with something different to the usual lines he is used to."
4,Phonics helper,My 6 yr. old daughter struggles with phonics and Title I suggested using the magnetic letters to practice spelling words and others that she has a hard time with. She also uses it to leave me messages.
2,Not sturdy enough.,"I had an old version of this cup holder which was a little different and great until someone broke it. This version is easier to install, but on both of the ones I have the mechanism that holds the holder upright and not tilted down became too loose after a couple of months. Now my drinks stay in the cup holder but they are slanted at an angle--which would cause a full drink to spill."
3,good enough,"I bought this product cuz my car doesn't has any cup holder so I think this one will serve my need. Well when I got it, it looks nice but when I hooked it with the vent it didn't fit the vent well and it's hard to take it off too. Oh!! and it falled off sometimes but it do its job."
3,Cable lengths not what was specified,"I got this cable because I have a case for my AmigaOne computer which has two drive bays side by side. This requires having a cable that is long enough between the master and slave drive connectors to be able to connect it to both drives. This cable works - but just barely! It is about an inch short of the distance given in the specifications between master and slave connectors. I would have given it a perfect 5 stars if it had that extra inch specified in the product specs. As it is, it is a very tight stretch to get this to work with two drives that are side by side."
3,"Good results, bad smell","My mom had bought this lotion at a local salon, so I thought I'd try it. The effects were nice. I switch between lotions alot and I really like the color I achieved with it. Initially, the smell wasn't too bad, it's actually a pretty light scent. But combined with the smell of sweat post tanning the smell almost made me sick. I mentioned to my mom that it smelled like a hot, rotten grapefruit. I know it's disgusting, but just trying to be honest. She then mentioned that was her issue with the product as well. Of course she neglected to tell me that prior to me using it. Before anyone says anything, I'm not an overly sweaty, smelly person, but I think we can all agree lotions smell differntly post tan. Overall, if you can stand the smell, the lotion isn't bad. It feels good on your skins, leaves it soft and the bronzers aren't streaky at all."
3,so-so,"this cd, although beautifully executed sounded a little too much like elevator music. needed more violin and less backround instrumentation"
2,Worked for a year or so,"This worked for over a year before dying, but it didn't work at times during the (central Indiana) winter. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least I gained the plumbing for a tankless when installing this unit. Also, I wanted to use my existing Class B venting and this was about the only tankless option for that, so I knew it was underpowered for whole-house use. My advice would be to pony up the money up front and get a better unit."
1,A big mistake to buy this unit,"I researched the Bosch tankless hot water heaters before buying it; at the time there were only a few negative reviews (unlike now!).It has been a ""worst buy"" for me--expensive install, erratic performance, sometimes too hot, sometime a shower turns cold, sometimes it won't ignite at all. At the moment, it is less than 2 years old and completely non functional.Call a repair tech and have it repaired? Replace it with a HOT WATER TANK and call this experiment a failure?Weighing all the issues with it and after reading that many others have the very same issues, I guess I'll go back to a plain low-tech hot water TANK and throw this expensive piece of junk in the trash.If you are thinking of buying one, my suggestion: BENEFIT FROM THE BAD EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS AND DON'T DO IT."
4,avg. battery life,"These aren't the longest lasting batteries, but if you're using them for simple tasks, they should do the job well."
5,Light and Glory Synopsis - by the Author,"Training Begins...The sun rises on a grey, dismal November morning. And even as Lewis Pratt prepares breakfast for his children, degenerate renegades from another world launch a terrible assault upon Earth. But the disaster is abruptly stopped, and fantastically powered men and women appear and begin rescuing and healing the traumatized Earthmen, who find themselves presented with an unbelievable reality:A man known as Serehahn the Anhar, who rules and covertly puppeteers the distant, magnificent world Nratherme, had enlisted the renegades behind the disaster and will inevitably assault Earth again, he desiring our world and its people in his intent to harness a forgotten force that has forged our past and yet commands our future...So begins the first of the eight portions of the epic Närdamähr, the heroic history of the triumph of courage and hope as brought about by unassuming, simple people like the Pratts."
5,Michelle Kwan The Winning Attitude,"This book is so great. It tell how your children could overcome fear and disappointment. I recommended this book to everyone. Michelle tell what it took to be a champion not by winning, but by over comming fear."
2,You can't expect much for $20,"I ordered a set of white sheets & pillowcases and did not run across the same problems other have had with differing shades, but boy oh boy, do these sheet fuzz up! We've only had them for a couple months and they're already dingy no matter if we bleach them or not.They're already starting to wear and become thin on the areas we sleep on and the pilling is really really bad. BUT. They were cheap and at least we're not out a lot of money. I personally wouldn't waste money on these again - not with how often they're washed & used, anyway."
2,Too small and not the best quality,"The quality is not much to brag about. As another reviewer stated, the colors are slightly off and in clear daylight you can tell they don't match. I don't know if they wrinkle a lot, haven't gotten to that point yet but just by texture I can already tell that they won't wash well. O and lastly, they are really small, a lot smaller than the size you buy. Beware. Pay a little more and get something decent otherwise you'll be stuck with these like I am now!"
2,no words to the music??,The hokey pokey words??? Where are they? put your_ _ _ and your ---and your ---? Not very good without words.
3,"Numbers, No Letters","These are fairly large - one piece is definitely a handful for a little one. There are 2-3 of each number and then one each of the math calculation symbols. Honestly, if you want numbers that is great. I wish I'd gotten letters instead. No way this is any more than a nonsensical colorful magnet to a toddler."
4,Great for learning,"These are great for learning and my 20 month old used these to memorize his numbers! I'm slightly concerned about how tiny the magnets are since he has a tendency to stick them in his mouth, but so far so good."
1,Christmas disappointment,I bought this cd as a Christmas gift and think it is terrible. It does not even sound like reggae music. I was so disappointed.
2,Bad dimensions,"It doesn't fit my tub and is too short. I thought it would be standard width/height, but I guess I was wrong."
3,"When they say ""hand wash,"" they mean ""hand wash""","I've owned this shower curtain for nine months and only recently decided to wash it due to some discoloration along the bottom edge. Well, I thought I could put it in the washing machine - despite the label saying ""hand wash"" - and, alas, I now have several splits along the edges of some of the stripes. All at eye level. I've decided to buy another curtain because it's nicer than a clinging vinyl curtain and I love how it diffuses the light in my bathroom. I'll just take more care the next time I decide to wash it."
1,shower liner??!!,"this thing does not repel water at all, i might as well of put a bed sheet up there. my external curtain gets soaked. i'm buying another liner right now. i should have known better when it was so cheap. the positive reviews astound me."
5,Buying another one I love it so much,"I've owned this same liner in the linen color for several years, washes great, dries fast, I've never had a mold problem, nor any problems with rusty grommets. So when I recently replaced my shower curtain, I had to have the same liner in white. It's definitely more high-end than a cheap vinyl liner and looks more expensive than it is due to the subtle monotone stripes."
3,Perhaps a mini-series might have been better?...,"This is indeed a lavishly produced film. Nicely captured was the opulent life of the upper class, a stark contrast to what the Tsar's family was reduced to towards the end. Nevertheless for people familiar with the history of the last tsar, one would be bothered by the amount of details and facts left untold. Also the editing for this movie is somewhat choppy. ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" is great as an introduction for those new to the Romanov saga (Robert K. Massie's book of the same name, which this movie is based on, is a must-read). For those in the know, however, the movie may come up short, despite its length."
4,"Elegant, Ambitious and, yes, Bloody","N&A, though over thirty years old, still plays with the bravura and sweep that a big historical film epic should and that we expect. It has ripened well with time and has lost none of its power. The fall of the Romanovs and the rise of Soviet Communism would be an extraordinary cinematic undertaking in any age, but few contemporary film makers would attempt so ambitious a project. A shame really; our present epics are more about CGI instead of ... well, anything, and certainly not serious subjects like history. Looking at a film like Nicholas and Alexandra should make us realize how mainstream movies gave audiences credit for intelligence decades ago - and how they need to start doing so again."
1,acting too out there,"I felt the acting was very understated and illogical in this movie. It is rare that I stop watching a movie, but I shut this one off due to boredom. Sorry I purchased now and wished someone had panned the movie before I bought it."
1,WORST MOViE EVER!,"I strongly disliked this movie very much. It was educational, and I guess you can't criticize true stories, but the ending was terrible. It should have gone on to explain where the bodies were buried or where they were out or what happened to the rest of their extended family? I did not like this movie at all."
4,"Atmospheric, brilliant supporting cast","This is one of the more historically accurate period dramas I can remember seeing. Beautifully shot, in a style remniscent of Doctor Zhivago, giving the sense of the politial tension and social hardships of the day. A bit long, but necessarily so. The complexities deserve attention. Must mention Tom Baker's hypnotic turn as Rasputin. When he's on the screen one can't look at anyone else. Highly recommended if you're looking for something a bit more challenging than Shakespeare In Love."
4,"A great, beautiful, and real book","I love this book, not for what it does, but for what it doesn't do. It doesn't romanticize being poor or in love, it doesn't gloss over the story and make things too easy. This book made me feel dirty, uncomfortable, and elated and thoughtful at the same time.In the addition I own, Charles Bukowski wrote the intro, this book shows the influence he took from John Fante. Fante writes strong, real characters who are never all good or all bad. That's what makes them beautiful. Take a risk and read this book if you haven't yet."
3,Fante . . . Fanta . . .,"considering that I read Bukowski BEFORE I read Fante, I was not impressed . . . Mickey Spillane is more interesting . . . I had to fast forward several times in order to stay interested . . . too romantic . . . I won't be getting any other books by John Fante."
2,Very dissapointing,"Dizzy Gillespie is my favorite trumpeter and Oscar Peterson is one of my favorite pianists, actually he is one of my all-time musical heroes. You would think that those two together would come up with something really amazing, but that is not the case. The problem is with Oscar Peterson. He is technically brilliant as always, but... he plays SWING PIANO almost through the entire album. A duo of this kind is a unique opportunity, and I would have expected Oscar Peterson to think through the possibilities that this opportunity offers and come up with an original, integrating accompanying style. Instead, he plays a boring stride background behind Dizzy Gillespie over long passages, which can hardly be inspiring for the trumpeter. The result is that each of the two plays his own stuff, almost without interaction. This session was a great opportunity for both musicians, but they failed to realize it."
5,"Great Flavor, Natural and Crispy",This is a great snack or entertaining product. You gotta love the crunch!
3,small compartments,the medication compartments are small. If you take many meds this is a serious problem. Given that those who tend to need this kind of devise also tend to take several pills several times a day it is rather impractical for the compartments to be so tiny. They cannot reasonably hold more than 3-4 pills each. Worse if the any of the pills are big there goes the entire compartment and sometimes big ones won't fit unless you reduce the number of compartments. Even when the compartments are reduced in number the size leaves much to be desired. The battery cover also falls off easily which can be bothersome. Yet I do appreciate the handiness of having something that can remind for more than 2 doses each day.
2,style not substance,"I was glued to this book on a vacation at the beach until the last chapter then sorely let down thinking I had missed something after all the build up, all the subtle nuance, the supressed eroticism that preceeded it. I think the author needs a bit more experience in setting up a plot and bringing it to a satisfying conclusion, even though I was enthralled with the descriptions of early 20th century Vienna, forensic and psychology research of that era, curious ideas about sexuality and especially female sexuality, and the tidbits of gypsy lore. Like other reviewers, I think this begs for a sequel with Erzebet and Wally. I haven't seen this brought up but there is a real homoerotic subtext in Wally's feelings for and dependence on Erzebet, which would make for a good continuing plot concept. This is a good writer who needs some assistance in following through."
3,"Moody, atmospheric, historical mystery","A good historical mystery, with wonderful descriptions of life in Vienna in the early 1900s. The author obviously did a lot of research, from the dress and conventions of the time down to the items served in a coffeehouse I liked the contrasting storylines between the investigator and his wife, both running their own searches for the truth. I found the ending a bit odd and somewhat disturbing."
3,Lots of interesting facts but the ending falls short to the incredible build up.,"I was very impressed with the amount of research Jody much have conducted to create the many perspectives in this book. But the end was quick and disappointing. It almost seemed as though she was tired producing detailed accounts of everyone's actions, demeanor, and the surroundings and just felt like ending it. I still give this book 3 stars for Jody's ability to portray a mental image of Vienna in the 1900's."
2,I Gave it the Benefit of the Doubt,"I tried. I really tried to finish this book. It sounded so promising and the beginning was a page turner. At page 166, I gave up. I am the type of person who will sit through a horrible movie and likewise, continue to read, until the end, a terrible book if only to tie up loose ends. I blame myself for not having the sado-masochistic tendencies needed to read this book in its entirety."
1,Does not fit e755,"FIrst of all, they come in a pack of 12. I have no need for 12 and one or two would have been fine. I would not have had a problem, if i didn't buy 12 for $20 only to fnd out that they are too small for the e755. Not to mention that I had a very hard time getting all the air pockets out. I threw them all in the garbage."
3,Not the most absorbing book read this summer.,"The book definitely does give some interesting information about the series and the people involved with it, but at the same time, there is quite a bit of rather boring information.The best interviews are those with people who worked behind the scenes (which is most of the book), really - though not all are as interesting."
3,A Good craft to share with my grandchild,"These books are a good source for crafts to share with my grandchild, although I would not purchase a new copy if a used one were available. They are pricey considering the content."
2,Not required,The airlines have nil requirements now so it is a mute point.Anybody can get hired in less than two years with NO experience .God help anybody riding on todays airlines unless you go up front to see who is flying.Make sure he has been there at least ten years.
1,Fairly Awful Game,Its just awful. Bad everything. Yet another terrible liscence trying to get our money by attaching another t.v. brand to a dire little computer game. I was not a happy gamer.
1,stinky,I have this game andit stinks. I don't like it very much. It is stupid and you do the same things over and over again.
3,Great gameplay - VERY FLAWED online system,The gameplay of this game is lots of fun but don't buy it for the online aspect. The GameSpy system does not work as well as the system used for SOCOM2. The biggest problem is finding a game to join. I use a PSX2 connecting to the internet with a broadband cable connection but it's difficult to find matching players and I always lag out of the game. I'm also blocked from joining PC games which seem to have high average ping ratings. If LucasArts can come up with a patch that makes the online play system match that of SOCOM2 then this game would deserve an easy five star rating.
5,This game ROCKS!!!!,"I first played this game at a friends house and was instantly addicted. You can fly TIE fighters around and drive an AT-AT and shoot the enemy. Best of all, you can chose which side you are on, and play against or with your friend(s), since you link up 32 people with X-Box, or play online. Abd you can drive tanks, fight in the clone war, and command your armies with differt commands."
5,"SW fans get ready, this is the game we've been waiting for","I love this game. The negitive reviews are mostly silly and not justified. This is exactly the Star Wars game I've been waiting for and I love it! Get in all the vehicles and shoot all the weapons, from ALL the movies! Sign me up for Jedi class, I'm ready. Exactly what I expected and a lot of fun!"
3,Good Game for Young Kids,"My boys (ages six and eight) have enjoyed this game for hours on end. The two player mode is more fun, since the single player mode doesn't require the player to do that much. I found some levels to be quite challenging."
5,what a star wars kid wants,Star Wars Battlefront is perfect for my child! He gets to play in his favorite movie battles and he can be the empire.Most games don't let you be on the bad side. This is incredible.
2,Gets old very fast,"This game is fun at first, but gets old way too fast. Their aren't very many different places to go so they get pretty old. And although every battle is tecnickly different, the computer played bad guys do pretty much the same thing every time, so even the battles get old. It might be fun to play multiplayer - I don't know, I've never tried - but I doubt it. There are some fun things about it that keeps it relatively playable, but not many. If you find this game at a yard sale for a small amount of money (as I did), go ahead and get it, but it's not worth more than about $10."
4,The Best Video Game I've Ever Owned,"I know what many of you will say.....best ever? That may be a stretch for you but not for me. I've had this game for months and months and I still play it all of the time. I've never had a game that I literally could not get tired of playing.There may be games with better AI, better graphics, better this and better that, but in terms of pure fun, there has never been a game I've enjoyed this much.I've been playing video games since Pong.I've owned hundreds of games.The $50 I spent on Battlefront was the best money i ever spent on any kind of entertainment.Even after all of these months, I can still find a new tactic to try everytime I play. It simply never gets old."
5,Get a clock to put near the TV,"This is the best PS2 game I have ever played (better than NCAA2005 and Socom). Sweet graphics and sweet gameplay.The online features are very cool, but there are challenges connecting initially (as another review pointed out).It is way better than Socom II for online play in the respect that those people with Mics can all talk to each other without hitting a button (and with the computer adding people to both teams, it is really more than 8 vs 8, it is like 150 vs 150)."
5,Well built,"Though very utilitarian, this is one of the best ideas in yard cleanup items I've come across. It's light and manuverable. The bottom handle for easy tipping demonstrates the thoughtfulness of the design. And of course, the space it saves when collapsed for storage is just the icing on the cake."
3,denise,"This version is quite heavy even when it's empty, so not as easy to use as the one with the soft bottom which is much easier to drag round the garden even when full, though this one is more durable."
1,Fiskars Hard Shell Kangaroo,"I have been using these Kangaroos for years. They are totally wonderful for doing yard work and toting along with you. I am very excited that they now made a hardshell bottom because after a few years of being dragged across the yard the wire comes thru. I tend to leave my outside so I can throw dead flowers, branches etc in all week long, and they still hold up great. It's also nice that you can collapse them down to hang in the garage when not in use."
2,"PLEASE UPDATE THE BOOK, no one even knows what a word processor is anymore and no you can not back up your work on floppy disc","This book is rather elementary and really out dated. He has a chapter about buying a word processor. If you have absolutely no idea what written script coverage is then it will give you an idea but other then that, forget it."
5,Versitle,"My son is an avid airsofter and was having issues with his current set of goggles. He is 12 and so many of the goggles are too big for his face. These were a perfect fit and had a great range of vision. They are tinted slightly, so you can see in the sun.On another note, they are also good for chopping onions. My sister was chopping onions in her endeavor to help with Christmas dinner and saw them on the counter and put them on! No tears!"
2,Not worth the money,"First and foremost I'll say that these are possibly the worst airsoft goggles I've ever used. The lens fogs up way too easily and too fast. Not exaggerating- at times, it only takes about ten seconds to fog up to the point where you can only make out basic shadows. I do not recommend these to anyone. That plus the rubber frame doesn't hold onto the lens very well. Poses a possible serious hazard if you're playing against other people."
3,Like a grad school textbook,"I really enjoyed Shermer's earlier book ""How We Believe,"" a well written and engaging book. This one on the other hand feels like a textbook, a labor to get through. He makes some great points, but this is DRY stuff. If you're looking for a scholarly examination of good and evil, pick it up. If you're expecting another informative/entertaining book like ""How We Believe,"" skip it."
3,A Reasonable Effort,"This is a good overview of how ethics might have originated, but not a particularly good (pun intended) justification of ethical rule. Shermer is always entertaining, but he lacks philosophical rigor. A much better exposition on both can be found in Michael Berumen's: Do No Evil."
2,Paperback cheaper than e-book...,"...And I can't lend it to anyone, can't resell it, can't make notes. It boils down to this: I bought a Kindle too early, I have to wait for publishers from the stone-age to disappear."
3,The picture is a little misleading...,"I actually like this product for the way I use it but the picture is definitely misleading. There is no way you'll be able to fit your meter, a pen multiple needles, lancet, etc in this thing. It just isn't big enough.I use this organizer to put both my Lantus and Novolog insulin pens in and a handful of needles and some alcohol wipes so I can throw the whole thing in my computer bag when I'm out working. I do still need to carry my meter case with strips/lancet/meter though."
5,I felt I was with theTerasaki family during the war in Japan,"This book was referred to by Lillias Katesube in her book that I recently read. Both Mrs Katesube and Mrs. Terasaki were contemporaries having both married Japanese diplomats in the 1930's, Mrs. Katesube was Scottish though. Both books give a first hand account of life in Japan pre and post war. What I liked about both books is the love the women had for their husbands.Michelle Watts"
3,Girls first game,I bought this game for my girls who are 7 and 5. They had never had a video game to play of their own so this was the first. I bought them 9 altogether and this is one of the best according to them. They enjoy that they can be barbie (different ones of course) or ken. They also enjoy that it is a two-player game that they can play together. All in all well worth the small price I paid for it.
4,Nice neck pillow for the price,"Like the other reviews of this product, you have to love the smell of lavender and can be overpowering if you are not in the mood for fragrance. I try to use this every week while watching television to help relax my overworked, shoulder and neck muscles."
5,The Grass Is Singing,"I believe the intent of Doris Lessing is not to incite sympathy in readers, but to bring across a poignant tale of human conflicts. Doris Lessing tries to convey the complexity of human emotions, that in reality it is hard to draw the line between right or wrong. I personally feel that The Grass Is Singing is by far the most human novel I have ever read."
4,The Grass Is Singing,"This is the first of Doris Lessing's books I have read.Her subject is a sad one. However, her style of writingis so superior. I felt it well worth my time to read herwork. Two more of her works are now on my bedside table."
5,Faster than fast!,I needed to show this to my students before we saw it as a play in an abridged version. It got here so fast and enhanced our unit immensely!!
3,Would Not Watch Again,"Lots of cussing, using God's name in vain. Drinking. Smoking. Mean guy tries to kill Annie. Woman wears very immodest night gown in one scene."
4,Great gift for $5,My daughter was in the play Annie in the fall and it was awesome to be able to give it to her in her stocking for Christmas!
5,FABULOUS!,I'd forgotten how terrific a movie this is. Great music and wonderful characters. A cast at their peak. Don't miss this musical.
1,Problem with the DVD,"First off, I would like to make it clear that the 1 star rating is for the DVD, not for the film, which I would give 4 stars. I would like to warn anybody out there who is planning to purchase the DVD of this film that there is a major problem in the framing of the widescreen version. Throughout the film, there is a starnge electronic ""zooming"" that often causes viewer to lose picture on all four sides of the image! This is apparent in many of the shots of the film... Although, this problem lies only in the widescreen version, and that people purchasing the disc for the pan and scan version will experience no problems. Just felt I should let everyone know that."
4,"What can I say? As far as I'm concerned, it's a classic.",Cute extra features (especially for the little girls that like to sing and dance along). Also nice section on Aileen Quinn all grown up.
1,widescreen?,what a waste of money-WIDESCREEN- its how the movie was made you morons-spend your money on the out of print edition this one is stupid C.R.A.P!
3,NOT WIDESCREEN!,"please be aware that there's no widescreen format included in this dvd. i bought it assuming that the ""anniversary edition"" would have it, but it didn't. i seriously felt cheated.so, here it is: content - five stars (it's a great musical; smartly written, great performances by an awesome cast, funny and endearing.technical - one star (crappy full screen only)"
1,Full-screen?!,"This DVD of ""Annie"" is the full-screen version, wherein 40% of the picture has been chopped off the sides. It is virtually unwatchable, and Sony should be ashamed for releasing a widescreen/scope film in this way.Sony has previously released the widescreen version of the film on DVD, but without the special features or DTS sound, so it might be best to wait for a future release that presents the film properly and has the bonus features. Or wait for the inevitable Blu-ray release which should be really nice."
5,One of the best movies I have ever seen!,This movie is great especially for children.My friends friend is Aileen Quinn and my friend was in the Broadway version.It makes me happy to see my friends.
4,Not Cheesy for Little Girls,"Cheesy or not - sometimes parents have to weather through the bad movies for thier childrens' sake. I saw this movie when I was a little girl and thought it was the BEST movie I had ever seen! It took my breath away and now it does the same for my daughter. Bash it all you want, but for little girls, its' a dream come true!"
4,Fullscreen is appalling!,"I agree that the full screen version otherwise distracts the viewer from what should be a great viewing experience. If there was any value in John Huston directing this movie, it is in the scope of the sets and the dance scences. In this version, it sometimes looks like some amateur put down their camcorder accidentally leaving it on--like when Molly sings ""You're NEver Fully Dressed"" there is a shot of the ceiling and you only see Molly out of the lower corner of the screen! Bizarre, and I hope they come out with a widescreen version."
5,All the charm of the original!,You can never go wrong with any Annie movie. This is an awesome DVD and has some very cool special features. Not your typical blah re-release of the same old movie. This DVD is worth every penny!
2,Okay Version,"Having spent a month & a half performing in the orchestra for the stage version of Annie, I thought I'd enjoy seeing how the movie version compared to what we did. I was disappointed, to say the least. Especially since John Huston (one of my favorite directors) was at the helm.To me, Annie is family fare, and this movie had some elements not appropriate. There was one expression of profanity, the remainder were some suggestive dance sequences I was embarrassed to have my daughters see. And considering my daughter was an orphan in the play we did, she was taken aback at some parts of the movie, too.And the time the movie was made showed its dated-ness. I thought the musical sequence where the driver (an Asian) and Punjab (an Indian or Pakistani played by Caribbean Geoffrey Holder) dance was stereotypical in its portrayal.We found the Disney version, which I hope is closer to what we did."
1,Copied from VHS?,I am not reviewing the film but the disc itselfThis is one of the worst transfers to DVD I have ever seen or a recent filmIt looks like the took a VHS that was recorded on a UHF channel and burned it to discOh but it has been restored for this special anniversary addition in “HD” - no that was the sound - not the picture.Well it was only $5 and I needed it for some kids that are doing the play in school – but you would think it would at least be in widescreen now that everyone seems to finally have 16x9 TVs – it is not even full frame but pan and scan
5,Great Buy,Books came on time and in perfect shape!My 2 year old son absulolutely loves Clifford books and they are so easy to read.I have 10 of the Clifford books now.
5,MY boy clif,Clifford has hom boy and a hom gril name T-bone and cleo and one day cliffordwas a little puppy and Emily Elizebeth want a dog and she got she saw a lot of but she want clifford and she took it . Home and and he was a very nice dog the love made clifford grow so be they had to move I like this book.
1,"Love the TV show, disappointed in the books","I knew that this was a classic book series, but I was surprised at how old fashioned (in a bad way) and stilted these books seemed. Unlike the TV show, which seems to have heart and lessons to learn, the books seem empty. I have a few and I almost want to hide them so my daughter doesn't choose them! (Which she does sometimes because she likes Clifford, but the contents of the book don't hold her attention.)"
2,"OK for beginning readers, but the scale is all wrong","The Clifford stories are sweet and good early reads, but has anyone else noticed how Clifford's scale changes from page to page? In one frame the kids can ride on his back like a horse and on the next he is bigger than a house. What is with this?! This variation grates intolerably on my (otherwise implacable and VERY tolerant) adult sensibilities, but I avoid pointing this out to youngsters clearly enjoying the book."
2,"Disappointing, repetitive and rather incomplete.",The author states that she doesn't want a deaf dog owner to feel the hoplessness and fear of loss that she experienced when she discovered that her puppy was deaf; then she does just that. Owning a deaf dog is no more of a challenge then owning any dog. A good dog training book was a better investment with much more practical information than can be obtained by reading this one.
3,Eh...kind of unnecessary.,"If you just adopted a deaf dog, it's nice to know that there are other people who have successfully trained deaf dogs. You'll get that from this book, but otherwise this book is kind of unnessary. There are online resources to get you started with training tips (like getting a deaf dog's attention by flicking the lights). But beyond that, training is just the same as with a hearing dog. I don't want to un-recommend it, but it's just not entirely necessary."
3,Throw Mama Off The Train,I was unhappy after watching the movie because mama was still on the train!! I want mama off the train!
5,An essential addition to your video collection,"The music is wonderful. The acting very believable and if I have any complaints they are personal. I do not like bullfights or to see women with underarm hair--but as I said, these are personal prejudices and not a condemnation of the production itself. Certainly the bullfight was essential to the plot! Placido Domingo is wonderful, both in his singing and acting ability and if it seemed to some that he was too old to be so naive...well, a man in love is not necessarily in full command of his wits (nor is a woman). All in all, even if one is lucky enough to be able to enjoy 'live' opera, this video is a must for those times when one must stay home."
5,Bizet's Camen,"Beautiful opera in film mode so you can see a lot more than when on theatrical setting. I got it so cheap because it is on tape form rather than on a dvd. Also it was so cheap compared to other sellers to the extent I thaught it will be in an auful condition, but the opposite it is great. I am fameliar 5to this specific production. So I knew what I was buying but was afraid of the low price lest it would be bad condition BUT IT WASN'T. Thanks to the seller and to Amazon."
3,"Silly production, get another video","My first complaint is that the music wasn't done right. My second complaint is that Julia Migenes is not only not good-looking enough to be Carmen, she cannot even sing the arias well enough. Domingo, on the other hand, is perfectly cast and has a wonderful voice. The movie also has some cheezy moments, they could have been more tasteful. As Maltin puts it, this production is ""overbaked."" Migenes has hair on her armpits and rolls cigars on her thighs... And the music is not well performed. Poor Bizet, I wonder what he would have thought. Although there is still much to enjoy in this video, serious opera buffs may be disappointed. However, I do hope that this movie production helps reach people who are not usually into opera."
2,Gritty realism juxtaposed with the artifice of opera,This film version of the great Bizet opera aims for gritty realism right from the start - during the opening credits a bull is impaled and killed during a bull-fight - of course this realism goes out the window as soon as the characters open their mouths and begin to sing!This is a well-mounted and well-sung production but the juxtaposition of a realistic setting with the artifice that is opera just doesn't work. The cast are not helped by the obvious lip-synching especially noticable during close-ups. The limitations of the singers as actors are also ruthlessly exposed.Lovers of the vibrancy and passion of Bizet's great opera are best advised to look elsewhere.
2,Beta male fantasy,"Of course Brooke's character would want to have the only boy on the island inseminate her; what choice does she have?In a version of this story where the girl shared the island with two boys, as soon as she began to ovulate, she would assess one boy as the alpha and the other boy as a beta, then offer herself sexually to the alpha boy. The beta boy probably wouldn't get any sex at all from the girl, unless he killed the alpha boy (like in ""Lord of the Flies""?), which would promote him to acting alpha boy.But showing the brutal reality of human sexual selection wouldn't make as good a date movie, would it?"
3,It's more than a film on comedy club,"Chaplin said comedy is tragedy plus time. I love the character Tom Hanks plays, a medical student who fears blood and would not have opted for learning in surgery but for his parental instructions. What really moves me is not the lines (they are funny) but the philiosophy the whole film brings out - be yourself, always."
4,A good value,"These 9V Rayovac batteries work just fine for me. I haven't had any problems with them dying prematurely. I've bought other Rayovac batteries and have always had good luck with them. If I have problems down the line, I'll come back to update.Otherwise, love the plastic pack they come in. They are neat and easy to store. I don't have to worry about the batteries falling out or some unsightly package. It's the little things that make life easier."
1,Half of all batteries leaked within a month,NOT FOR SMOKE DETECTORS!!! STAY AWAY!!! I purchased these to do routine battery replacement for smoke detectors in our home. After I installed these batteries into all smoke detectors I had a great sense of accomplishment. Until one night one smoke detector started giving warning signal. I had to take a battery out to find out it leaked. Then it happened again once in the evening and another time in the night. Just last night I had to pull another smoke detector out in the middle of the night. When I got to my battery organizer to get a replacement I found that one of the last two batteries leaked while sitting in a plastic storage box!!! STAY AWAY FROM THESE. Maybe Rayovac makes decent batteries but definitely not these. These are not worth a penny!
1,Questionable battery type?,"I bought the pack of 8 for my guest room alarm clocks that need a 9v for backup when the electricity goes out which it does frequently in the country. I can't get a single one of the five clocks to work with these new batteries. Is this a NEWER type battery that doesn't work in the older alarm clock? My clocks have 00P6 on the inside where the battery goes. All the other 9v I have purchased before work and I have one of the older ones with enough charge that I tested the five clocks with the old battery and they all worked. Should I be more specific when ordering 9 v batteries or did I get a ""dud"" box. The expiration date is 2016 so unless they were stored outside in the blistering sun for months they should be okay."
4,NICE AND UNIQUE BOB DYLAN TRIBUTE,"The song selection is diverse, the singers are diverse, Steve Howe's guitar playing is diverse. What more could you ask for? The only disappointment are the songs where Howe sings lead vocals. I say much better to have used outside singers on all the songs. Each vocalist brings a different perspective to each song. From Jon Anderson to Phoebe Snow. Not some of your most well known vocalists, but immensely talented they are. Especially liked the loose, laid back vocal by Allan Clarke on ""Don't think twice"". If I didn't know better, I never would have guessed this was the lead singer of the Hollies."
1,Johnson Brothers Dinnerware: Pattern Directory and Price Guide,"I was especially interested in the different backstamps of the Heritage Hall pattern, I didn't find them. I was very disappointed in the absence of Heritage Hall pieces. I returned the book."
1,Do not buy,This book will not help you draw people. There is no instruction. this book is compiled of hundreds of sketches from exercise videos and porn. The drawings are mediocre and are not good to learn from. If your serious about learning figure drawing check out Prudhon and Anthony Ryder. Don't waste your money on this book.
1,No muscles at all,"This was not what I expected. There is no instruction provided as to anatomy or musculature, just many sketches mostly from a female workout tape. The ""muscles"" were non-descript. Also, if you're considering this for a younger artist, several of the sketches have annotation that they were drawn from a ""stripper"" tape and are somewhat provocative both in content and ""clever quips"" as commentary by the artist; inappropriate to my way of thinking. I've returned the book to amazon.com despite having to eat the postage."
2,"well written but dull, dull, dull","The Mysteries of Udolpho is beautifully written. Ann Radcliffe writes page after page, after page...of picturesque descriptions of Italy and France's countryside.That being said, I found The Mysteries of Udolpho to be long winded and drawn out. The first two volumes are rather mind-numbing and I skimmed over much of it. I never felt a connection towards Emily and felt rather indifferent towards her well being. I found her to be rather insipid and became tired of her constant fits of weeping and fainting. Her servant, Annette, was more intriguing than Emily and her pathetic weakness.I would personally recommend skipping The Mysteries of Udolpho to read Sheridan Le Fanu's novel Uncle Silas. Young Maud finds herself in similiar circumstances but approaches them with not only grace and sweetnss but a strength that she ""finds from a place unknown"" to herself. You will cheer for Maud in a way that seems impossible to do for Emily."
4,the gothic masterpiece,"this is a very long novel. the story doesnt pick up speed or literary brilliance until 200+ pages in when the heroine Emily finally comes to the mouldering castle of Udolpho for 200+ pages. Here and in herlast gothic novel, ""The Italian"" Radcliffe achieves the most staggering and successful use of literal ""darkness, or night"" effect to create suspense, suspicion, and fear among her heroes and heroines, primarily. It is slightly dull at times early on until the action begins on arrival at Udolpho but then it is a very strong novel worthy of its praise as Mother Radcliffe's gothic masterpiece and the pinnacle of first wave Gothic fiction."
5,Exceptional!!,"A very good book, I can't express it enough.. Very dry and slow moving at first, but once the events and story starts unraveling it's hard to put down - I read it in 3 days time I was soo absorbed. All I thought about was getting back to the book it was fantastic.If you read this book, once you get past the slow beginning, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed."
4,A man and a guitar touring the states looking for something he may never find.,"Ok that sentence may mean nothing to you but that is how listening to this album made me feel. Reading the sleeve notes as I listened were certainly a key part of that illusion.This is not the wonderstuff, the sense of fun is clearly missing. however while different it is not all bad, the songs here are all good, some excellent. Miles Hunt was clearly in a strange place when he wrote the songs here, many of the songs are introspective. His soul searching is there to be heard. While the cheekiness is gone, the wit remians, it is just a little more biiter. wiser but perhaps less confident. from quite introspection to tales of brief encounters and the ends of relationships, this album always makes you feel."
4,Good Miles,Good new music from Miles Hunt in acoustic mode. Now all we need is for him to realise that he needs a good band behind him to make some great pop songs!
5,"Don't worry Miles, you got it right this time","I'd heard most of these songs performed live when Miles performed a couple of gigs in the UK earlier this year, and I'm a big fan of the Wonder Stuff and Vent 414, but I was amazed by this album when I finally got to hear it. Every one of the tracks is superb and each with a story behind it - given in the sleeve notes. Some of the lyrics tell of recent times on the road in America and others give an indication of a wonderfully introspective Miles.Miles shows his talents are not limited to singing and guitar, even returning to the drum stool, and Malc Treece's guitar and Martin Bell's strings and piano contributions and production work bring out the best in the songs.Excellent."
5,Early Cage and Modine hits a home run!,"Fanstastic effort by Cage and Modine in a story of friendship, determination, and break through. The story is told with humor and action. One of my all time favorites films. A must see!"
5,A must-see!!!,This is my all time favorite movie. The characters brought to life by Cage and Modine will touch your heart. They just don't make them like this anymore.
4,ACCURATELY PORTRAYS THE LIFE OF THE NATIVES IN LATIN AMERICA,THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE THAT SHOWS HOW A MAN CAN CHANGE HIS LIFE AROUND. IT SHOWS THAT YOU SHOULD TURN TO GOD WHEN IN TIMES OF NEED. THE NATIVES TOILSOME LIVES ARE DISPLAYED TO US. THE WAY THEY WERE UNFAIRLY AND UNJUSTLY TREATED WAS DEPICTED. THE HORRID EFFECTS OF EUROPEAN EXPANSIONISM WERE ALSO SHOWN. ANYONE WITH A HEART SHOULD GO RENT THIS MOVIE.
5,EPIC,Amazing movie! shows that not all spaniards were in favor of the colonization of America. This movie is about helping and protecting human rights. Great History.
5,Very spiritual and emotional; introduced me to 1Cor13...,"I now have a tattoo of 1Cor13 on my back right shoulder...it is the most beautiful writing i've ever heard...""if i have the faith to move mountains, but have not love, i am nothing...love is not arrogant, does not take account of wrongs, love does not rejoice in revenge...when i was a child, i thought as a child, i spoke as a child, now, that i am a man, i have put my childish ways behind me...now, I see a distorted image in the mirror, but when I know love, know the perfect, I will see clearly again...faith, hope, and love remain, of these, love is the greatest..."" this is paraphrased for easier understanding, but Paul wrote this to the Corinthians, and it says all anyone needs to know; along with the gospel of James (be a doer, not a sayer of the faith)...anyhow, the movie is very realistic with beautiful filming and passionate acting...the scene with DeNiro's redemption is cheap to put into words..."
4,The Mission,this movie was good because it showed that rodigo could change and that he would help the people that he had once hurt. it also showed that the natives were willing to forgive him and allow him to help them.
2,another languishing Native American film until Western Europeons save them,"This movie puts forth the lie to the ethnic cleansing of America. It shows if not for the kindly members of a Western Europeon church, the people would ""really"" suffer. The history in this film only supports the myth that the people of the Americas were rescued by the church. Absurd."
5,great service,"A terrific help and willing to work with me to get the product even when problems kept popping up. Thank you, thank you!"
1,Bad,Terrible movie. Stale dialogue and predicatable plot being the main culprits. Add to the list unrealistic characters and an atrocious overly-sentimental musical score and you have what could be one of the very worst films of all time.
3,Book one was brilliant...number two was lacking,"Book 1...I savored every single word of this work. The author manages to mix clever dialogue with long, well thought out passages of psychological insight. The descriptions of certain characters in this work, the cheating gambler, or the miserly landowner are clearly first rate. Obviously human nature has not evolved since since the 19th century, as I found myself drawing comparisons between people I know and Gogols players.Book 2...I was very disappointed time with book two. Chichikov has an entirely different feel throughout. The pages ramble along, and many thoughts are not clearly expressed or even finished. If after you read book 1, you feel you have had a good experience, close the book, and return it to the library/pass it along to a friend."
5,Great for Sony HDD Camcorder and Digital Elf,"I purchased this case to hold my Sony DCR-SR62 HDD camcorder (with extended life battery) and my Canon 410S digital camera. The case works great and leaves room for memory cards, spare battery, etc. More pockets would be helpful, but this case works great as is."
3,"Carrying Case, nice but too big.",The case is nice but is too big for this camera. Probably you will like it if you use to bring a lot fo cassettes with you. If you want a small case as the camera look for other one.
4,"Where can I find a VHS of ""The Colored Museum""","If anyone knows where to find a video of ""The Colored Museum"" that was aired on PBS in 1991, any advice would be appreciated!My email: carlahealy@aol.com"
4,Power Pruners,This ratchet pruner really does the job. I am able to cut off fairly thick stems of wild-growing stuff in the yard with this handy tool. The ratchet works gives much better leverage than regular pruners. A steal at the price. And they are handy to carry around. My only complaint is the closing/locking mechanism could be a little better.
2,I don't care for it...,"Like other reviewers, I found the errors which fill this book made many of her examples confusing. The errors also make me question the credibility of this text. This is the third edition; there should not be as many as four errors on a single page.Also, her tone is condescending at best. I'd rather not be spoken down to by someone who has produced such a poorly copyedited text...about copyediting.This book is a required text for a graduate class (in an English and Publishing program) and we all spent a fair bit of time complaining about it.In spite of this, it is reasonably helpful. I would, however, recommend purchasing stylebooks instead or at least in addition to this text."
5,Very funny,"A great comedy. This one is a little darker than the original at parts, but still definitely family-appropriate and guaranteed to have you in stitches."
4,Great For Fans of Charming Robots,"Short Circuit 2 is one of those movies in a class all it's own. The character of Johnny Five has an irresistible charisma that I just love. Sure, other movies feature an out-of-it's element protagonist possessing unusual abilities that both benefit and alienate it, but Short Circuit 2 also has believable characters, good dialogue and delivers an emotional impact. Witnessing Johnny Five's trials and tribulations proves to be an interesting experience.The biggest complaint I have is the fact you can't take the movie too seriously. There are some impossible actions taken by the robot that will leave you with a ""yeah right"" feeling. Also, some harsh language is used which I found to be unnecessary. It would've been better to leave it out in order to make the film suitable for all ages.This is one sequel that's superior to the original."
3,HELP HELP HELP,"Okay, the movie is a cheesy eighties flick that we all love.. bla bla bla.. I need help with the song in the movie..I need a hero... la la la la to the edge of the night... cuz he's gotta be strong and he's gotta be tough and he's gotta be making it right (or something)..HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLPe-mail me!"
1,Short Circuit 2 you amazon.com sells BOOT - LEG - DVD's,"Buyers Beware your UPC:NUMBER CAN'T DOESN'T WORK THIS IS THE UCP:505082242881 SUPPOSED TO BE FOR ""SHORT CIRCUIT 2""-DVDPLUS THE MOVIE DOESN'T PLAY SO THAT IS WHERE WE ARE,? I can't give you a video review because still today you haven'tReplaced the movie Short Circuit 2 and i didn't see the movie,the dvd that you sold me doesn't play."
4,Coleman Rope Handle Marine Cooler,I ordered the Coleman Marine Cooler with rope handles but it arrived with plastic ones. I didn't want the hassle of returning it and needed to use it so I just accepted it. It's a great cooler!
4,A much-needed overview of a highwater mark of the menippea,"Blanchard does better than most of the American scholars of the menippea... he is neither a cringeing bootlicker of Bakhtin's nor a servile flunkey of Frye's.He is particularly illuminating with regard to the menippean tradition of the italian humanists, a point which I found even more interesting after viewing an illustration of Pontano's nose in John Kerrigan's History of Comic Noses.Recommended for anyone wishing to know more of Burton and Menippean satire... also a good introduction to a genre which does not readily admit programmatic approaches"
4,A Cult,"This film became cult for me in high school, and has continued through the years. It is a great psychological study, and has incredible talent in the cast. What fun it is, to quote a line in a room full of people and watch the recognition light up faces. It is a must see for everyone from the that generation between baby boomers and ""X""ers."
3,More of the same.,"This is a compilation of Lowry's columns that have run in Black Belt magazine for many years. Some of the information is interesting, as long as you are willing to deal with the author's elitist and dogmatic point of view. Still, some of the information is interesting and much would be relevant to any martial artist. This book is a good read as long you keep an open mind regarding the author's sometime biased viewpoint."
1,Veterans HATE this Movie,"A documentary on the History Channel interviewed many of the veterans who were POWs that actually lived through what the movie attempts to dramatize ... every single one of these vets hated what was portrayed in this movie. I don't care how good a movie was made, if it's an insult to the veterans who were there, then it's an embarrassment."
1,Fictional account of wartime atrocities,"This film is an attempt to sensationalize one of the most horrendous atrocities of WWII in the Pacific Theater, namely, the building of the 'Death Railway'. The film under-emphasizes the fact that thousands of Allied POW's died at the hands of the Japanese in building their strategic railway through southeast Asia. Many of the characters and events depicted in the movie are utter fiction, and thus has no place in my collection. For a more accurate account, read Clifford Kinvig's book 'River Kwai Railway'."
2,Unhappy with video shaking,The movie is just fantastic.I have bought several DVD's released by Columbia. All classic movies seem to have the same problem this DVD has. The picture has a soft shake.The movie is great but I just wish the DVD had been mastered properly.
3,Don't Pay Extra For the Collector's Edition,"I could have bought a single DVD with the movie only for half the price but thought I'd go for the Collector's Edition. In my opinion, the second DVD is not worth the extra money. Mildly interesting background material. The reason you're buying the DVD is to watch the movie on disc 1."
3,Guiness in the Pacific,"An interesting film about a group of British soldiers that had been captured during the Pacific Campaign in World War Two. The British commanded by Colonel Bogey, played by Alec Guiness ( An amazing performance I might add) try to defy the rule of the Japaneese commodant who commands the prison camp. The Japaneese order the prisoners to construct a bridge over the river Kwai to provide troop transport for the Imperial Japaneese Army. Bogy refuses, and a large fued ignites. All in all, a wonderful film, but it does not hold for as long as intended."
5,"Thank you, Alexander Hislop","Still the definitive work on the origin of roman catholic ritual and practice, and NOT that difficult a read, despite the assertions of some (what a sorry TV-soaked generation we've become!) As a former practicing roman catholic for 30 years, I thank God for Hislop's research regarding the origin of the mother and child image in particular. I do think he was terribly off regarding the god of forces (Daniel 11:38) and perhaps was not himself a saved man, but still I thank him for helping me to see the darkness of roman catholicism. I frankly much prefer Hislop's work over that of Dave Hunt (""A Woman Rides the Beast"") and recommend it highly."
4,Excellent source of Pagan history,"For those of us who are part of the ""counterfeit"" faith that Hislop contends is represented by the Babylonian traditions and all of its offspring, this book contains a wealth of historical information. It provides a frame of reference for, and connections between, many of the ritual practices currently in vogue among neopagans. Of course, it is necessary to ignore the Baptist, anti-Catholic, religious bias of the author, but the scholarship is impressive. The connections made are based on numerous ancient texts, from a wide range of languages and cultures. Properly read, this is an excellent pagan historical resource."
4,Eye Opener,"After reading this book and checking out the reliability of the information it contains, I have changed many of my traditions and religious beliefs. It is truly frightening to see how our eyes are blinded by the accepted religious traditions and we do things that are truly unacceptable to our Creator. I found the numerous descriptions of the origins of our religious icons to be fascinating and enlightening. Any person who is truly interested in pure, clean worship of our Creator MUST read this book."
5,A 10 rating is not high enough.,"Alexander Hislop's research for Two Babylons was so extensive and accurate that the book has never been refuted. Not even in one point. This means that you can trust everything in the book to be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Not for Christians or Catholics who cherish their beliefs above knowing the truth. As a Christian, I recommend this book to any serious student of the Bible, and to all who really want to know the truth about religion and its ancient origins."
1,How low can you go? Very Very low!,Hislop is so bad even Woodrow disowned him once he checked itout.( ) Bigots of all stripes will love it because it looks scholarly. Of course it is actually riddled with errors. He even gets his pagan gods mixed up.( ) Try reading Catholicism and Fundamentalism by Keating instead and get the facts. END
1,"Beware: fanaticism, ignorance and the anti-Christ","Forgive me, but I cannot understand why anyone would be so keen to accept, especially in the prevailing atmosphere of empiricism, that which some other person would purvey without having first investigated the truth for one's self.For those of you that are ignorant of what Catholicism is, and for you Catholics who are ignorant of what other Christian sects, be they mainstream or fundamentalist, espouse, please, find out for yourselves before making another's prejudices your own.There is unity in difference, and difference in unity (or: what is the Trinity). Why not try to understand one another, instead of accusing one another? Or are we afraid of finding out that we are ALL children of God?This book will only offend the well-informed, but the ignorant, looking for something at which to point a finger, will love it. Kind of like ""Mein Kampf"" and other philosophies of hate."
1,Not fit to print,"It's incredible that this piece of anti-Catholic propaganda is fit to be offered as valid scholarship. This bigoted propaganda tract deserves one place only; the trash bin. Everything in its is a nonsense, anti-Catholic hatred and bigotry of the worse kind."
3,Deadbolt Kit,"Overall, the kit was a worthwhile purchase. However, the router tool and template were absolutely worthless.There may be better tools out there, but this was all I could find at the time."
2,"rather lousy, fortunately very short","The idea is excellent. Escapo is a world with stable population whose inhabitants beleive that their god does not allow any new inventions. Besides, the intelligent inhabitants don't have opposable thumbs, which would make advanced technology a bit difficult. Then criminals from neighbouring planet are sent out in a spaceship which crushes on Escapo. The young men immediately set to producing more opposable thumbs and start technological revolution. The endning leaves a lot to be desired, and writing is very bad. The summary of the book - mediocre writer ruins a basically good idea."
5,where is pendulum's prodigy mix of voodoo people?!,This is an absolutly fantastic album. i love pendlum. its just a shame you cant buy it off itunes. anyway the problem with this ablum is that the prodigy mix of voodoo people is not among the selection of songs in this album.I would still say this is my album of the century.drum n bass is awesome
3,Harder than the full size pillow.,"It's not as soft and comfortable as the full size pillow, but I'm sure it'll be better than hotel pillows for keeping my neck in check."
1,Cord Exploded at the Joint,"I bought this as a replacement for my laptop cord. The cord worked fine for about two weeks but for no apparent reason, the cord exploded while in use. Sparky loud bang and a bright orange burst scared everyone in the room."
4,It was great to see Glenn Ford and Rita,It was great to see Glenn and Rita. I got the Movie because I wanted to sing Rita sing Amoda Mio. I love the Pink Martini version of the song and they used footage from Gilda in the music video. It was odd hearing Rita sing the song after hearing the Pink Martini version.
5,Put The Blame On Mame!,"I just watched this movie last night and I LOVED it! I think that 'Chinatown' got a lot of it's inspiration from this movie...if you liked 'Chinatown', you'll love 'Gilda'! This movie is probably the quintessential femme fatale film noir. The dialouge is awesome. It's so film noir! Rita Hayworth is wonderful in this movie. This is probably her best film. The costumes are very nice. Even the guys dress cool in this film! This is one of the best film noir movies ever made-- it's right up there with 'Double Indemnity' and 'Matlese Falcon'! WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
3,"Nice designs, execution lacking","The designs in the book are interesting and challenging, though they are certainly not authentic Native American designs. I've put a good 10 hours or so into the ""Indian Maiden"" design only to discover that there is an entire column missing from the chart. I don't know yet if the other designs have problems, but do check them over carefully before beginning."
2,Holding the Line: Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike of 1983,"i was disappointed, because I love Barbara Kingsolver and everything she has written so far. This book was redundant. Could have been written in 25 words or less and conveyed the same message."
3,This is one book that I had few regrets about,"This book details the struggles of the women miners of Arizona. Their hardships were projected beautifuly by Barbara Kingsolver's use of descriptive words. Her often wild style threw me off a couple of times and her other work kind of worried me about the content of this book. I was pleasently surprised by ""Holding the Line : Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike of 1983""."
4,Christine (Special Edition),"I enjoy scarey movies, not gorey, but the movie keeps you involved.The movie has a good storey line, great actors.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys old classic movies."
4,One Of Stephen Kings Best Books Makes One Of The Best Movies,Christine is such a cool movie I mean a car that drives itself how can you be wrong the only movie of this genre about cars I belive is better is The Car staring James Brolin I find it to be more unique but this I saw this movie when I was 10 and for the next month cheked around corners for driverless cars lololol
3,"No, -deleted scenes..? -Wood of been nice for this movie..?","Hay, -what the..? -No deleted scenes in the movie.? -Allwe get it is 20 extras./? -Bought the old bare bones edition.?Dumb, -but the picture holds the test of time and it's deemnot a cult classic.? -But a sleeper Stephen King, -and JohnCarpenter hit in that early 80's, -eara.?This is a waste of time looking at the deleted scenes.?But i will buy it, -with the 5.1. sound on it.?"
5,excellent transaction,very happy with this movie. I saw it when it came out and now our Son loves it too. I wanted to get a better copy then the old VHS so that why i purchased a DVD versio. It is excellent..
4,good movie,This item came by mail on time and in great condition. We have watched it and find no problems with the dvd.
3,The Story's A Bit Old,"This book is clearly biased as it is written from the viewpoint of Laci's mother. So, in this account Laci walks on water. Scott Peterson is an animal and deserved what he got but I am sure Laci had some issues as well. I am only half way through this book but it's not easy and engaging to read."
3,For Laci,"I thought there was so much anger in this book it was hard to read....blamed everyone she could, sure, there has to be anger but when it interferes with the story line, it becomes a hate novel. I read and then threw in the trash...."
4,A Question About the Book,"I just finished this book and agree that it's a moving account by a mother determined to understand such a senseless act. One thing that left me perplexed was this: Sharon mentions the very precise account from a psychic of exactly how Laci was killed and where the body was dumped (which turned out to be accurate based upon the body's location when it surfaced). The psychic said Laci was strangled with a lamp cord. In an earlier chapter, Sharon mentions seeing a lamp shade out of place in Laci's house during the police walk-through, yet she never draws a parallel, wondering if the lamp broke in the struggle, and Scott never disposed of the shade? Did any one else pick up on this?"
5,An extraordinary feat of love,This was truly the best book I've read about this horrifying case. Sharon Rocha's profound love for her daughter penetrates the pages of this book and therefore the heart of the reader. It's quite extraordinary.
4,for laci,"i remember every detail of this case, from the outside looking in...from the moment they announced on the radio that laci was missing and scott had been out fishing (i remember thinking how that didn't sound right) to the very last of his sentencing. i found this book to be a fascinating account, heartbreaking to be sure, but to see the process of how the family went through this ordeal, and to see laci as the person that she was before she became a story in the news, was worth the read."
3,ok,"Tracks 8, 10 and 11 are great. The cd in general could have been better, but it reflects the movie which by the way was excellent."
4,Great little gadget,"Perfect for what it does. Great sound even at 1/2 speed. Looping is seemingless, and guitar effects (distortion/overdrive) are surprisingly nice. However it does not read files converted by Mac softwares such as itune. I recommnend using Realplayer for all MP3 conversions; beside that this little gadget is my best nonhuman friend. Now George Benson, Joe Satriani and other guitar monsters make perfect sense to my ears."
4,Kattan is Fall Down Hilarious. We Want 'Mango' Movie....,"Kattan is definitely one of those actors who is seemingly from another planet. His manic posturing, his wide eyed stares, his innocent, well meaning klutz stance all serves him well in this sometimes over the top comedy with a preposturous premise on how a gangland family has the 'nice' vetinarian son infiltrate the FBI in order to grab hold of the pater familias' record on a series of mob related incidences. The FBI has taken to Py-ssahnt's penchant for wearing obnoxious ties and flubbing his way thru serious undercover assignments. His co-stars Falk, Penn, et al, seem to be enjoying themselves in this comedy. It's big fun for folks who don't mind laughing at something in this vein. Kattan is a Jerry Lewis clone without the 'Hey, Laaaaadaaaay' goofiness. But he's still very funny and very goofy. Can't wait for a Mango movie."
2,Very disappointing,"I almost turned this one off after the tired shtick Kattan played out in the vet's office. But I must say the part with the accidental cocaine buzz right before speaking in front of a bunch of kids was pretty damn funny. Aside from this, I could barely stand it. Some might call this mindless entertainment. Mindless? Very. Entertainment? Not really."
4,Solid Reference Book,I find this book to be a very helpful desktop reference for telephony terminology. I have worked many years as a IS data network professional and have recently been required to interface more closely with the telecom side of my department. This book has helped me gain the knowledge and language I require to speak intelligently to employees and vendors with regards to the telephone network. I highly recommend it to anyone in a similar situation.
2,"Sub-standard, very disappointed.",Not a well thoughtout and often incomplete in many areas of today's telecommunication. Its volume does not justify its contents. Recommend Newton's telecom dictionary instead.
2,THE BORING WESTERN MOVIE,I thought that the movie was kind of boring and not enught acton . for the movies i like to wacth. i would not watch that movie again if i dont have to the movie silvebapo.is not my kind of movie i like to wacth . i like funny movies because it does not put you to sleepi know that this movie was going to be with guns and cowboys. lots of shouting but i dont like western moviesit kind of mad the movie good with music that thay played.
1,I Hate Western Movies,"What I did not like about the boring movie is when the guys went into the house where the lady, the guy, and the litle kids house I think that was really mean cause i dont think that other people would like some big mean guys to go inside their house and disrespect their family just because of something that someone that lives in their house did I think that, that is so mean. But the part that I most hated was when the guys started heating the lady and the litle kid that was really mean why would they do that if is not their fault that the guy did not do what they told him to do so that is what I hated there was a sad part and that is when the guys took the the litle kid with them so that is why I did not like the movie."
4,Great Western,"I don't really watch westerns but when i do there almost always good. The kind of movies i like to watch are action and comedy. ""Silverado"" doesn't really have comedy but it sure has alot of action.The moviewas great but the part i least liked was the ending of the movie. My favorite parts of the movie was the shootouts and when they fought. I think what made the movie ""Silverado"" uniqe was having to African American characters in the movie. The sound track of the movie went with what was happening. The movie had many good quotes but my faorite was ""This use to be a peaceful town."". Before i saw the movie i knew it would be good because most westerns are and i was right."
3,Really widescreen?,"Having rented the DVD from a local outlet, I was disappointed to behold an aspect ratio of 1:1.85 when I distinctly remember watching this great western on a super-wide screen at the theater AND believing the DVD package label which proclaimed it was presented in an aspect ratio of 1:2.35.Someone tell me....has this movie been re-issued in its proper version?"
4,"Has some problems, but I love this movie...","An attempt to pay homage to the old westerns of days past, this film is not meant, somehow, to entirely be taken ""seriously"". It has a sense of humor about itself, that plays throughout much of the film. Still it's mostly finely acted and pulls you in. I enjoy the interplay of the characters and in some ways even more the interplay of the actors -- many of the best actors of their generation. Worth seeing just for the great Brian Dennehy and his interactions with Kevin Kline. (And it didn't really die at the box office, it did okay at the time) You will recognize the fabulous theme music as it's been used everywhere for everything, but it started right here."
2,I dont like Westerns,"Well I dont like Westerns but this movie is about of a chance meeting, four cowboys on horseback are drawn together to defeat a sheriff and his bad posse. An unjoyable bad western.I dont really like westerns though this movie had a really bad story to it.This movie was super boring all they do id shoot eachother for money and then they go to bars and get drunk and then then they start fighting for no reason.There are cowboy,horses,and hookers in the movie and I just personaly think it was a stupid movie. But maybe people who like Westerns might like this movie but I didnt like it at all."
2,Dislike andLike,"when i watch the movie i was looking for action. It had lots of it in the movie.I didnt like it asmuch because it was to old.And plus it was not my kind of a movie.Because i like my kind of age movie.The only old movie i like is like ""Scarface"" and Bloodin and Bloodout. The soundtrack did go with the movie because it was a modern western soundtrack.What must be in a movie i like is lots of action and there must be a guy that gets away with everything then at the end they try to kill him. If i was you i would not spend my money onthe movie.You might like it if you are a senior. And only if you like cowboys'yee ha'."
1,The most boring movie I have ever Seen,"This movie was one of the longest and boring I have ever seen. The movie suck since the begginig to the end. It had nasty music that did not go with it and ugly people that talk funny. One of the things that suck the most was the way they act, what I mean about that is when they died it look so fake, not even blood came out and they look like they wher playing with 5 year old little kids. One of the other things that I did not like was the clothes. I know that they have to be western but in other movies they look beter than in this movie ""Silverado"". So if I was you dont by this dumb movie"
2,One bad movie,"Sadly, I was not all that impressed by this movie. The dialogue in this movie leaves much to be desired, and the overall feel of this movie is more along the lines of a made for TV movie. I have to admit that I'm not an avid Western movie watcher, but still, I've seen many that are much better than Silverado. I will never waste my time watching this movie again."
4,Modern Wstern,"This movie was a great movie to me but it had its let downs. What makes a movie good to me is one that has lots of action, adventure and not to much computerised. I don't usually like westerns because they don't intertane me. What makes amovie suck to me is to much talking and that I'm not beliving what is happening.This is a tipical western by the horses, and the way they talk. What makes this movie uniqe from the other westerns I've seen.I thought that the sound track was exellent and perfect timming and placing.I didn't notice any fore shadowing. All the extra little scenes did kind of help the movie, it gave it it's mood.Over all I did like this movie. Oh yeah one of my favorite quote was ''I don't want to kill you and you don't want to be dead.''"
5,Guadalupe lived here!!!,"Fantastic!!!I couldn't put it down!Respectful without being reverential, scholarly without being pedantic, and above all, immensely , wonderfully, READABLE!!!On his portrait on the back cover, Mr. Hanut seems to be a fairly young man; These are highly auspicious beginnings!!I can't wait for the next one!Give this book to your friends, no matter what their religion or politics are- there is magic in it."
5,WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK!,This book is dazzling- it begins as journalism and ends up as literature; A wonderful pilgrimage- and a wonderful read!!I can't wait for his other books!
5,Does his greatness ever end?,"I have read all of Barker's work and this, by far, is his best to date. A true mingling of fantasy and horror with just a pinch of science fiction for good measure. Barker has always been able to captivate his readers with his visions of Other Worlds and Fantasy landscapes, and here he brings with that an ensemble of characters that just beg for attention as they twine through a history of events quite unlike any other. If you enjoyed Imajica\s sense of adventure and Weavewarld's sense of wonder then there is no disappointment to be had here. This is not just fiction--this is literature!"
3,Frustrating,"This was my first Clive Barker book. The concept of the book was a good one, but unfortunately, the characters didn't have depth. There were many, many loose ends and many topics that should have been touched on more. Sure it would have made for a much longer book, but a more interesting and less frustrating one as well."
4,Looking for something different - No one does it better.,"An excellent effort for an author who continues to defy the limitations of imagination. What a pleasure it is to see an writer take such care with every sentence. Perhaps, it's once again the bizarre paths Barker takes us on, that deprives him of the acclaim he so richly deserves. While most authors churn out another rehashed ""the devil did it"" or court drama, Barker weaves another creative gem. I thought it was much stonger than Sacrament and perhaps his best since The Great and Secret Show. I didn't mind the different direction this book took, because it was done well and still ala Barker. I do however long for him to once again reach back into his horror cook book, such as the chilling short story books he earlier released. The only negative to book was the fact that that the story ended with still unfinished business. Hopefully, Galilee will sail again!"
2,boring and pointless,"This was the first time I'd read Barker, and likely the last. The story doesn't begin until nearly a quarter of the way through the book, and, quite frankly, it wasn't worth the wait."
5,Barker does the fetish!!,Clive does the trick again!Marvellous prose and bizarr erotic.Fantasmagoria at its most extreme.Barker rules!!
4,Kind of wide,"These are excellent quality glasses for the price. I did have to bend and shape them to fit better. They arrived essentially flat without any shape to them, so they fit strange. My only complaint about these is that the lenses are a bit wide apart for my face. They may fit you better but, this is my 7th pair of glasses and they are by far the widest pair in my collection."
4,OPTIMUM NUTRITION COMPLETE DIET BAR FDG TRFL 15/,"The Optimum Nutrition Complete Diet Bar Fdg Trfl is a good product with okay flavor. The fat content and sugar is low, which is what I was looking for. Be forewarned, however, that these bars are pretty small. So if you have a big appetite, these won't satisfy you. Otherwise, good deal overall."
5,A real winner,"I gotta wonder what it would be like to live in Woodstock, NY, from whence at least three of these dudes hail (I think Fast lives somewhere in NJ). Not only are they consummate musicians, but they play good music, too, not always a given (e.g. Dream Theater). No overt showing off, but anyone who knows music is blown away nonetheless.I'm a long time PapaBear fan, from Gabriel through KC to BLUE. But I was quite disappointed in Waters of Eden. Far to mellow for the guy who put together the bass line in KC's Sleepless. So when I read on Tony's site that the new one is a little more reocked out, I bought it sound unheard.I've given it a few spins so far, and WOW! What a fabulous band PG had back in the eighties! And they have matured and incorporated many influences from their musical careers, so that the result is fresh and interesting.It will be hard to outdo this one. Perhaps if PG were to sit in on some numbers..."
4,"levin ""el desconcertante""","Sin duda Tony Levin se ha ganado a pulso el sobrenombre de ""el desconcertante"". De todos los músicos que han pasado por King Crimson es el más dificil de anclar a un estilo determinado. Si analizamos sus discos y colaboraciones vemos que van desde la más melifua ""new age"" (World Diary, Waters of Eden), hasta el Heavy Metal más obstruso (Liquid Tension Experiment), pasando por sus sesiones con Peter Gabriel o David Bowie, o por la música ""étnica"" (From de Caves of Iron Mountain. Este disco puede ser un punto intermedio entre todas esas facetas, hay un poco de todo sin que, por ello, peque de heterogéneo. Se trata, probablemente, del mejor disco de Tony Levin. Un músico que, hasta el momento, era más conocido como músico de sesión o parte de un grupo (King Crimson) que por sus propios trabajos individuales.Este disco viene a demostrar algo que ya se está convirtiendo en máxima: ""cualquier músico que haya pasado por King Crimson"" tiene algo importante que decir."
2,FALL IN LINE,"I wish I could agree with the other reviewers here, but after listening to this I have to wonder what's really going with ""Pieces of the Sun"". Is this CD just an exercise in the selling power of the Levin brand? After hearing it, I simply can't think of anything else. Not that we can reasonably expect sustained innovation and perpetual invention from every musician and every composer, but Mr. Levin's prior and many remarkable accomplishments make this CD pretty hard to swallow.Here's the (generic) experience: Whenever this CD is playing I find that (1) somewhere, about ten minutes in, I will forget what I had put on and that (2) when I take the CD out of the player and remember what it's supposed to be, I tend to let out a little groan that seems to bother the dog. ""Pieces of the Sun"" teaches me once again that, unfortunately, a great name does not guarantee great music. Check out Upper Extremities instead."
3,Decent,"This film had some very creative action scenes with spare use of SFX. It would have been MUCH more enjoyable with a more capable female lead. I was QUITE annoyed by her constant grunting and being out of breath FOR NO REASON. She needs to take some notes from Sandra Hess, Brigitte Lin, or Maggie Cheung. SOMEbody. The only other negative was the percussion obsessed music over the combat scenes.I give it three stars for the futuristic feel, tragic love story, and very creative samarai styled action sequences toward the movie's beginning. The lead character is definitely a trooper though and very likeable for her persistence and resilience. I would have given it four if the lead actress was more convincing. I love chicks that kick butt--and she does that part but she sounds like she's about to die all throught he movie and it was just really frickin' annoying."
1,Don't let anyone tell you this is a good movie...,"good reviews of this movie are another example of the kindheartedness of movie goers... after reading the hype surrounding this movie, i did a foolish thing... i bought it sight unseen. another harsh lesson learned. onto the movie: a transparent plot coupled with terrible acting and dialogue, one would think that at least the fight scenes would redeem this film. guess again. crappy SFX, silly posing and posturing stop any hope of the validity of this as a movie worth watching, let alone owning. the introduction of out-of-place random characters, no explanation of even the secondary characters roles and no evident trace of final resolution all add up to this being one movie to avoid even on penny night at the local vid-mart. in the words of the great urban poet Chucky D: don't believe the hype."
2,Movie sucks,Movie Boring...Story Drags...barely any action...if story drags should have atleast good story to keep interest but it had nothing...booo
3,Ok movie,The princess blade is an ok movie.Plenty of swordfights and action but its secondary story is rather lacking in substance.The character of Yuki definitly could use a sequel where she hunts down the killer of her friends.All told worth the watch.
4,HOFFMAN ON THE ROCKS,"A harried husband (Dustin Hoffman) finds out what it's like to raise a child as a single parent after his wife (Meryl Streep) just packs up and walks out on their lives. Today, divorce stories are a dime a dozen but when ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" first hit the scene on the cusp of the 1980's it was a genuine revelation. And although we've seen the story told and retold countless times since, nothing quite captures the immediacy and sheer energy of this ground-breaking American classic.Columbia TriStar has given us the film in a pretty good looking transfer. Yes, colors are dated but they are incredibly well balanced and, at times, even vibrant. Some minor aliasing in fine details but nothing to distract. The audio has been nicely restored. There's a documentary that's pretty informative, albeit short. BOTTOM LINE: YES - A KEEPER!"
2,Oscars...,"Kramer vs Kramer is a decent movie. Not a master piece or a brilliant movie. It is... okUnfortunately, Kramer vs Kramer will always represent one of the most unbelievable things the Academy did. To give this movie five Oscars and to simply dismiss Apocalipse Now, sounds today as an heresy or a bad joke.Maybe the people in the Academy had too much to drink that year. That is one possible explanation."
5,"This Movie Should Be Called ""Therapy Vs Medication""","In this movie we see Meryl Streep walking out on her 7 year old son and her husband. She does this because she feels ""trapped"" and ""needs to find herself"" or any other cliche you can think of. If you got the impression that the 1970's was a time for self absorbtion and introspection you are quite right.So then she wants the kid and after getting him she decides to let the father have him. This is one flakey chick who kind of reminds me of my ex wife who I divorced but I did have enougth sense to retain the Marital Home.I think Kramer's wife is in real need of Therapy and Medication because she can't seem to make up who she is, where she is at ,what she wants or who she loves. I give this movie 5 stars because thankfully Ms. Streep has disappeared from our screens in recent years after we all overdosed on her in the 1980's."
5,"As ""Human"" as you can get.","There is little I can say of the effect this movie had on me because I was so drawn into the story and the characters that I almost thought I was part of this human adventure of a family caught up in a legal battle to preserve their total existance. I must confess that even though I wasn't there, i tried to offer my sympathy as the story progressed and I felt so deeply involved.Enough that the acting all round was spectacular and, if you don't mind seeing a real ""weepie"", you should get this movie."
4,"slow shipping, but beautiful","Slow shipping, but this frame is just as beautiful in real life as it is on your computer screen."
5,Greatest poem in the English language,"If you think about these things, eventually you will conclude that no English poet has ever used language more magically than the Shaker in Acts II and III of Hamlet."
5,"Frailty, thy name is ""human""","I had previously read translated versions of Hamlet, but I discovered that nothing compares to reading it in the original English. Shakespeare's words are an art form without equal, exquisitely mixed with a story of human anguish and emotional struggle.No staging of this work or great movie of the play can replace reading the play word by word. Admittedly, reading the play is intense and difficult work, but the joy of the journey is quite worth the pain. The charm of the language is equal to the complexity of the story. The genius of this work is not the language alone, but the mastery of describing Hamlet's inner hell. Personally, I think Ophelia was another tortured soul on whom Shakespeare showered extra attention to describe her suffering.This work doesn't need my modest praise; Read this master piece!"
3,"Either good or bad, but thinking makes it so","A classic, but not Shakespeare's best tradgedy. Fewer sparks of brilliance and depth of multiple characters than Macbeth, Julius Caesar or the Richards."
1,Not appropriate for small children,"I bought this for my 3-year-old granddaughter, and it frightened her. Not appropriate for small children. I threw it out. This is the first Disney story I have seen that I felt was inappropriate."
2,Not what I hoped it would be from the box description,"Well, the review title pretty much sums up my feelings on this DVD. While a couple of the cartoons were pretty funny, the packaging makes this seem like it'll be a movie about the villains taking over the House of Mouse, and as other reviews have mentioned, such is only an afterthought and a cool song. It's not just the packaging either--the overall marketing and the trailers shown on other Disney DVDs make the same claims as the info on the box. Let the buyer beware!Having said that, if you're familiar with the ""House of Mouse"" TV series, this should come as no surprise. It's basically an extended episode of the series--in that series, there are several cartoons with a loose plot hanging them together, exactly what you get in this DVD. Still, it would've been a bit more honest of Disney to market it as what it is rather than upping the anty. Rent before you buy, that's my recommendation."
3,Another cute Disney cheapie,"Just like Christmas's ""Snowed in At the House of Mouse,"" this direct-to-video 70 minute film is made up mostly of new and classic Disney cartoons (this time all with a Halloween theme), with little bits of new animation in between focusing on Mickey and pals running a toon nightclub with all the Disney characters in the audience. In this story, about five or six of the classic Disney villians decide to take over the House of Mouse, though their reign lasts only about ten minutes. All in all, it sounds cute and worth it for the nine shorts that are sprinkled throughout."
3,We didn't use it,"A word of caution to new parents. Don't assume your child will need/want all the products that are marketed to you as 'Must Haves'. I'm a little skeptical of the reviews below as they make it sound as though Graco has re-invented the wheel with this one. Our healthy (big) baby boy was disinterested from day one and we tossed it around his four month birthday. (Glad we didn't buy a 'glider'). As mentioned in a review below, the mobile doesn't really work. If you get this product save the box in case you have the same experience. Adequately made but an otherwise worthless bib hanger for our family. We've found our son prefers to be with us or in his crib with a real mobile.And oh yeah, unless you and your child are into 'Electronic Classical' I wouldn't expect to much from the music library on this thing either."
2,carsonsmama,I was not a big fan of this swing. My daughter only used it a few times and she hated it. Her head always fell forward! I do not recommend this swing or even any like it. I wish I would have bought a cradle swing! I put my daughter in my friends cradle swing and she fell right to sleep! I think fisherprice makes one and then there is the baby papasan? That is a good one! I will definitly be buying a cradle swing for the next baby!
1,Don't buy this swing!,"My husband tried to put this swing together twice (two different sets). The first one was missing parts and the second one's fabric cover did not fit right. So, we are now opting to purchase a completely different swing on the third try."
4,Should have been made as a portable swing.,"I loved this swing when we put it together, however our son was 10 lbs. at birth and it seems to narrow for him. I can't imagine he will fit much longer. It's not worth all the money. He does LOVE the bears and it does entertain him, then he falls fast asleep. The music is great and will play forever if you let it I also love that you can adjust the sound. If I did it all over I would have gotten a portable swing since it wold take up less space. There is no need for these large swings unless you are looking to take up space in your house. They shold make this in a portable size and a bit wider!"
1,Don't waste your money!!,"Ugh. First of all, in the forward of the book, the author says that calling a fairy a ""fairy"" is insulting to them and they prefer to be called ""gentle folk"". Right. Then why is the word fairy in the title? This book is more a rundown of current and antiquated holidays with some fairy ""lore"" thrown in from time to time. And really, she only mentions parties in the very last chapter as an aside. A total waste of time and money. If you must read this book, I'd recommend checking it out at your local library. I'm sure there won't be a waiting list for it!"
5,Fun teaching tool for toddlers-preschoolers!,"I am a big fan of wooden puzzles as they are not only fun and educational but also durable. Learning Resources makes some really good educational wooden puzzles which I have purchased for my 3.5 year old daughter. This particular puzzle does an excellent job of reinforcing the difference between ""Left"" and ""Right"", as well as the numbers 1-10. Fun, educational and hardy! Note: I find it really useful to store these wooden puzzles in a drawer or puzzle holder [and little ziploc bags to hold the smaller pieces in]."
1,Background music,This Is a boring Lambchop album!I have the other albums and they are great. Espesicially the first three albums. When I listn to this album I want to do something else than listn to music....This album Is perfect to play In elevators or at the shopping mall.
4,mostly swell,"And boy did I feel like a woman reading this one. I didn't finish it though and when I skipped ahead, it started to sound overly analytical and pretentious. However, I can't talk down this anthropologist. She has so much to offer anthropology and is truly gifted in her influential writing, the detailed subject matter, the matter of fact-but still emotional language is intriguing. I wish I could speak to her!"
2,Eh...,"I am a huge Cassavetes fan but I cant say this one did it for me, and I dont believe it really does Cassavetes any Justice.Watch this one last, the story has alot of corny part. Cheesy lines from the young actor who, gets better as the film goes along, but almost completely ruins the first half of the film with his terrible, and i mean TERRIBLE, acting.Purchase CASSAVETES FIVE FILMSGet this later...."
5,80'S OLD SCHOOL BEST,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ACTION MOVIES FROM THE 80'S. I LOVE THIS MOVIE, NEVER A DULL MOMENT. I WAS GLAD WHEN I FOUND THIS MOVIE ON AMAZON."
1,Facimile means Black and White,"This is a great book for thought and discussion however, the version available here is a facimile. This is a BLACK AND WHITE COPY of the original published book. none of the many photos or color graphs and charts are usable, for that matter visible. Amazon does not have the color version at all. I did get a speedy refund and free return shipping, but I missed the time before my upcoming show to read it. The show DID go on."
3,"Style, absolutely no subtance",This movie is packed with special effects that will make most happy. But if that is taken away then it's no better than the old godzilla films.
1,A vile piece of putrid garbage,I hated this so much I can hardly find words to express my utter contempt for all involved in this monstrous abortion.I hesitate to grace it with the word 'film'. Truly wretched.
2,Crap,"OK, let me say that I love Sci Fi, I loved Jurassic Park, and actually am pretty fond of monster movies. That said, Godzilla really sucked. Whether it's the atrotious acting, the lousy story, or the terrible script; Godzilla sucked. Just to give you and idea how bad the script is here are a few examples.Part way through they just happen to loose Godzilla. Would think it would be hard to loose a 200 ft. lizard but they do. A general claims that he could be hiding in one of the buildings but if that were true wouldn't they just have to look for the building with a big dinosaur shaped hole in it?Another example is when Mathew Broderick determines Godzilla is pregnant by giving it a home pregnancy test. Enough said. The only thing that stops me from giving it one star is the amazing special effects and the terrific helicopter sequence."
4,GOOD GRAPHICS,This video had one of the best graphic that i have seen in a movie in a long time. But the plot wasn't very well planned. So Four Stars.
2,Could've been great,"Godzilla (1998) is a movie that really frustrated me in that it doesn't have any depth to it at all; it plays out like some video game with special effects with a weak and elementary script. There's no darkness to this movie, nor is there much seriousness, doom or suspense. The overall mood of the film is very light, which makes it a laughable experience overall. I thought that the story of Godzilla was supposed to be darker; it lacks the elements of a similar franchise, King Kong. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. The second star is for special effects. Sorry I have to be so honest :-)"
1,Toho Studios should sue for character assassination,"When you find yourself (like me) looking at your watch repeatedly during a supposedly exciting film, you know the film stinks. I can't honestly say I had high hopes for this film, being a fan of the originals, but I was willing to give it a chance. Sadly, it didn't deserve it. Jean Reno was the only person who came out of this misguided project with any credibility. Poor Matthew Broderick looked completely lost, especially in the first half-hour or so he was on screen. And frankly, for a project whose main appeal seemed to be how fantastic the special effects would be compared to the Japanese films, the effects are surprisingly cheesy at times (check out the helicopter chase scene - can we spell FAKE-LOOKING COMPUTER-GENERATED TAT?) PS: Leaving one ""Jurassic Park""-style baby dinosaur alive to carry on the story seems like wishful thinking in hindsight. With luck, TriStar won't make more of these films."
1,"FX rule, the rest sucks","For those of whose intelligence wasn't insulted enough by 'Independence Day', here comes Godzilla. Yes, I'll admit, I bought the hype and rushed out to see it the day it opened. Why can't these people use the gazillion dollars they use on special effects and come up with a script and a plot? Sure, it made a ton of money but did you ever meet someone who said they liked it? The one true highlight of the film is watching French actor Jean Reno do a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The rest is total rip-off of Jurassic Park and every other 'good' movie out there."
1,Is this a movie?,Holy crap!! What a piece of junk. I have never been so angry after leaving a movie theater. Everything about GINO is a big letdown. Dont waste your time on this garbage!!
1,Not Godzilla,There is really one argument that can be made about this not being Godzilla: Godzilla. Does. Not. Run.Ever.Having Godzilla running from the army neutralized any hope n my mind that this was a faithful remake. It's not Godzilla.
4,Why 4 and not a perfect 5,"The movie is great and it is really good to see another point of view for godzilla (American) instead of the traditional Japanese. I am a big Godzilla fan andI think that this is a most for any fan. As for the others who are not femiliar with the title, I think that this movie will give them a nice experience especially cause it is suitable for most of the family members. Action, good story, superb acting, perfect SFX, and ofcourse Godzilla. Finally, the DVD got 4 because it should be loaded with extras or at least double DVD set. and that is why and only why it got 4."
2,Godzilla Imposter!,"I love the Toho Godzilla,but this monster sucks!I can't call it Godzilla beacuse it's not Godzilla!This is just a Godzilla Imposter!The real Godzilla doesn't lay eggs.Godzilla fights other monsters.This fake imposter doesn't fight crap!They shoudn't of called it something like Fake Godzilla, and besides they shoudn't of made it fight a gaint snake or something."
1,Garbage!,"The Big G becomes The Big Sissy in this mindless, annoying, and totally unredeemable pile of celluloid trash. After years of bashing the Japanese Godzilla, America responds with a big iguana(Despite popular opinion, Godzilla is NOT a lizard! ) that runs from the awesome military might of the U.S. Army's elite BoneHead Corps. To pad out the 936 hour running time, Devlin and Emmerich throw out every crass one-liner known to man and then some. Mankind threatened by annhilation? Of course we have time for a tepid romance subplot and goofy jokes that children would scoff at. Why not just send the Three Stooges out after the creature? The results would certainly be a lot funnier. Here's a hint Hollywood; If you can't find a brain down in those deep pockets of yours, then just shut down and go home!"
1,Trash,"They should take every copy of this film, put it on a spaceship, and send it to the moon so no one can ever have to see this piece of absolute gargage ever again."
1,i want my money back,i paid 1 cent for this i want that back. this movie sucked badd i bought this for my mother. she a godzilla fan since her childhood. when she seen this she threw this dvd on the side of the floor. i said i check it out. boy this is a jurassic park rip off. that is a lizzer not godzilla. this movie is STUPID!!!!!!!. im gonna trade this in for jersy shore season 5 dvd when it come out.
1,Godzilla rocks. This sucks. This is not Godzilla.,"First of all, I am a huge G-Fan, so if you think that the old Godzilla movies ""are dumb"" or ""have crappy special effects"", don't even bother reading this review. In fact, you should go lie down in the middle of the expessway. Anyway, on to the review.This is not Godzilla. This is not the indistructable, imortal, invincible behemoth that obliterates Tokyo, beats the crud out of the military, destroys Tokyo again, gets hit with eleventy billion missles, and inadvertantly saves the world from another giant monster. This thing is an outsized homosexual iguana that burrows underground, eats fish instead of nuclear reactors, runs away from the military, blows stinky wind instead of an atomic ray, makes goo-goo eyes with Ferris Beuller, and dies after getting hit with a few missles. I hate this movie, and anyone in there right mind should too. So go ahead, make fun of the old movies. They're way better than any Hollywood trash out there."
3,It is a good Moive. The put down was it was spos to be great,it was great at some parts and not so at other
2,Superb special effects... but no writers to be found.,"The movie Godzilla will blow you away with the special effects. On DVD with a good sound system, you'll be mesmerized. Godzilla running through New York City being chased by helicopters and tanks is just amazming. Unfortunately, they were not able to dip into the $100 million dollar budget and find a couple of good writers. The writing for the old Godzilla movies made more sense and they were in Japanese subtitles. (The Siskel and Ebert jab probably killed their chances of making this movie into a potential classic.) Breathtaking special effects.. but I could have pulled out a couple of kids from kindegarten to do better writing."
2,Not as good as the original Toho creation...,"Well, it is a good monster movie, all things considered, but the problem was, right after viewing this, I put in a Toho G-movie, and was just, disappointed! If you're a fan of the original Toho Godzilla, you'll think this movie is average, if not, this will probably be one of you're fave movies. Good SFX, good characters, average show. Two stars."
1,Godzilla 1998,"I saw the original Godzilla at the movie theater when I was in 8th grade. It was Awesome!! I loved scary movies; therefore, the monster Godzilla was frightening. Raymond Burr as a reporter is great because he advances the plot as relays his emotions to his newspaper!! Now, as far as the 1998 remake...THUMBS DOWN!! There were more special effects and so forth, but this Godzilla is ridiculous. It's like taking Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and redoing it. BOO!!!HISS!!! What a joke! Anyone who loved the black and white original Godzilla should be disgusted with this version. Excuse me, but Godzilla was the STAR of the original one. It should have been left alone."
1,What a load of garbage,"Only the people behind ID4 would churn out such garbage like ""Godzilla"". After all, ID4 was a real stinker too. I can't believe they took a classic character like Godzilla and mutate him into something godawful like this piece of filth that was passed off as a movie. Give me the man-in-the-rubber suit over the digitalized version any day. The writing (or should I say lack thereof?) was pretty apparent, the acting...well I've seen better acting from five year olds, and the large amount of money spent on this turkey of a movie was thrown away. At least the original Godzilla is fun and campy. The overdubbing are so ridiculous you have to laugh but the lack of acting in this modern day version is offensive to this diehard Godzilla fanatic."
1,"Banal characters, banal monster, kill them all","Another big budget turkey from Roland Emmerich, who proves again that it always pays to underestimate the intelligence of your audience. Godzilla is ugly, the characters are boring, the romance is, well, uninspired, and frankly you hope the stupid monster destroys all of New York and then chokes to death. Don't watch this if you can possibly avoid it. Definitely don't buy it. It's a waste of money, time, and plastic. Think 2 hours you'll never get back."
2,Not the real Godzilla,"This movie isn't terrible, but it bears little resemblance to the Japanese version of Godzilla that became so popular all over the world. This version is part Jurassic Park, King Kong, Anaconda, and other similar movies. The producers of this film must have lost their focus somewhere along the way. Also, the 1998 ""Godzilla"" was incredibly overhyped, especially by gullible fans on the Internet who thought it would be a great film."
1,What's the point?,"He doesn't look, sound or even behave like Godzilla! So you have to ask, what's the point? If they renamed this ""Jurassic Park 3: Attack of the Giant Computer Generated Lizard"", I suppose you could write this off as mindless effects yuks. There are much better ways to spend a couple of hours."
1,"BORING, BORING, BORING",One of the worst films of 1998 is here. I loved Jurassic Park but this is a pathetic imitation. How could the studio waste 120 million on this film? What posessed Roland Emmerich and Dean Develin to make this crap? Godzilla looked more convincing in the earlier pictures
1,Simply Bad,"I was prepared for a bad movie, and this one dissapointed me. It really is awful. The special effects are terrible, the plot is non-exsistant, the acting is miserable.I was even in the mood for a smash em-up monster movie!Bad, Bad, Bad."
1,This movie sucks. I would rather die than watch it again.,I think it was a mockery of the first godzilla. If they make another one I know a few people who will not see it.
1,Have a bucket when you watch this movie,"confused by the title? when you watch this movie, you won't be. Godzilla ISN'T Godzilla. IT'S A FREAKIN' MUTANT RADIOACTIVE IGUANA, THE CHARACTERS ARE AS DUMB AS ROCKS, AND THE WHOLE STORY IS POINTLESS!!!!!!!!!!! want good advice? GET SOMETHING ELSE WITH YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"Godzilla was a good movie but didn't come close to the hype the makers made it to be. Matthew Broderick could have picked a better role for himself than this one. If this movie had lived up to even half of its hype, it would have weel some movie."
5,NEW YORK TRASHED,"A fun movie with great special effects. Try and see it on DVD wideacreenBesides, there are those of us who like to see NYC trashed."
3,Really Bad!!,"What in the name is up with this movie? It does not(like many others have said before me)deserve the title Godzilla!! I do think,however, that it is a pretty-kinda-good movie, I'll give you that, but the ending, WAS A TOTAL RIP-OOOFFF!! Why in the world did they take the most important part of Godzilla?? Without his heat-beam he is total not cool!!(it sounds corny,doesn't it??) I can go on and on and on, but I really don't feel like. but anyway, JUST DON'T GET THE MOVIE OR DVD O.K., PLEASESSSS!!!"
1,Godzilla 1998 sucks,"this movie is the only godzilla movie i do not like. the story is dull and uninteresting, and the characters are 1 dimensional(meaning they have no qualities or reason to watch). It was a good idea to make an american version of godzilla, but dean devlin and roland emmerich did'nt carry the idea through. They erased godzilla's(the real godzilla)little respect he had in the states. the new design for ""godzilla"" looked too dinosaue like, raptor to be exact. plus, a majority of the destruction in the film was caused by the helicopters trying to destroy godzilla(and everytime i am forced to endure this films horribleness, i wish they do). also, in the original, godzilla was a metaphor for the atom bomb dropped in hiroshima, and had value, character construction and a good message, this film has none of the qualities of that film or the series that followed. i urge you not to waste your money on this film, instead go by a real godzilla movie."
2,"Jurassic park 4 ,not godzilla","Not godzilla at all.Godzilla was very big and didn't hide in sewers.He knocked buildings down,didnt run around them.He was smart,not just a big iguana.This was more like an escapee from jurassic park.I liked Jean Reno ,hated Mathew broderick .I really disliked this film first time i saw it but later revisited it (this yr) and didnt find it quite so objectionable but still shouldn't have been called godzilla."
1,dont bother,"this looks like a jurassic park movie instead of a godzilla movie. this movie fails miserably its got good special effects, bad acting, terrible leading performances, and is way too long. unlike the other godzilla movies this movie is no fun at all. go rent the original one instead"
1,bad story,The effects were good. But a movie needs a good story to keep my interests. Special Effects without a story is a pretty boring thing.
1,SILLY anyway.,"I don't care if this huge reptile is Godzilla or not. I admit some ideas - like missile dodging agility - were not bad. But the plot is incredibly unconvincing and could not keep suspense. For example, an army loads tons of fish to lure the lizard from subway tunnel. The lizard appears as they have planned and nobody reacts! No attack, no panic, just watching the iguana groaning. Maybe good laughing stuff for cynical audience."
1,"""wimpzilla""","This is not a Godzilla movie, hey devlin, Godzilla breathes fire! Attacks the army! Is invulnerable! get a clue!, The monster looked like the ""Beast from 20,000 fathoms"" He's an iguanna? He spent most of his time running away, instead of on the attack. This was a miserable monster movie"
2,can't put in dryer,"I never got to use this sheet. I pre-washed it and put it to dry on low heat as I've done with all the baby clothes. I later saw the label said to air dry, which seems ridiculous for something that'll be washed so often. Anyway, it shrunk and doesn't fit over the co-sleeper mattress. If you have time/space to air dry it, it's probably a fine product."
3,Sheets fit but are pricey BUT are only choice for small mattress,"Fits mattress, includes velcro to hold in place. Too bad you can't fit cheaper and easier to fit sheets for arms reach can't find in local stores and these are pricey and only come in singles."
4,Perfect Fit,"This bassinet sheet is made to fit exactly for the Arm's Reach co-sleeper. My husband & I tried a number of other crib sheets & none of them worked on the co-sleeper. I have two complaints about the sheet though - on the inside edge of the sheet, there is velcro that sticks to everything else that I wash in the load with it. The other complaint is the price & the fact that I could only find the sheet here on amazon to buy."
5,Great book for a review prior to the examination,"This book will help every student to pass the examination due to it posts most of the question that have appeared in previous examinations but explained in detail. Every plumbing student should acquire this book. It is very helpfull due to it covers most of the aspects of the plumbing trade that will appear in the examination for the license. I personally, recommend this book."
4,Excellent family movies full of morals,You can't go wrong with the Karate Kid. Only problem is some of the discs are mislabled. KK3 is actually the next KK. I was able to correct this with a permanent marker.
4,classic 80's,"The first 3 in the set are what every fan of the 80's genre of movies should have in their collection. They are entertaining and exude that form that the 80's is so famously known for. Elizabeth Shue is in the first one. The fourth is an entertaining addition to the first 3 done in the 80's. I would reccommend this set to anyone who loves the karate movies of the 80's such as Bloodsport, which is also another great."
5,GO ROCKY GO!,WHAT A GREAT SET OF MOVIES I LIKE THE ONE WITH MR. T AND THEN WHERE HE HAS TO GO OVERSEAS AND FIGHT THERE REMEMBER WHEN MR T WAS ON CEREAL BOXES
1,none,"I never got the movie, i don't know what happen, but it's suck, because i'm here in Iraq, and in my free time i like to watch movies, but i never receive the karate kid collection."
5,PART II BETTER THAN THE FIRST,"Sequels usually don't live up to the legacy the first ones leave, but I have to say that Karate Kid Part II is better than the first. Karate is no longer about winning points in a tournament, but about defending your honor and way of life. The final scene is about life and death, not to see who gets 3 points first. See where Mr. Miyagi was born into the life of karate and learn about his ancestors. Find out the reason why Mr. Miyagi left his beloved homeland and first love. It's a wonderful story that has action, drama and comedy all in one. I definitely give this movie 5 bright stars!!!!!"
2,Missing a movie,We received it in good timing. 3 of them work perfectly fine except the the karate kid 3 is missing. There was supposed to be 2 movies in 1 and there was just 1 movie to see.
4,An Exciting Movie!,"I think this movie is the worst of the three in the series,although on a scale of 1 to 10 I give it an 8. I'd give the original a 10 and the third a 9. I still highly recommend it and the other two in the series."
4,from bullied to butt kicking hero,"It takes me back to the 80's watching The Karate kid, when martial arts was all the rage (fashion) it is a good family film which holds something for everyone, laughter suspense and the thrill of what good old Mr Miagi will show young Daniel how to defeat his enemies. Awesome family fun, go and watch it"
3,Contrived.,The Karate Kid Part II is no way as memorable as the orginial but at least it's not unwatchable like Part III. Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita have always had this natural chemistry - you can tell they were really good friends on camera and off. Some of the acting from the supporting cast is just plain awful and the pace of the film is rather slow. So-so sequel - stick to the orginial.
5,A must have for any religious scholar!,"This book delves into the scriptures with uncanny precision and wisdom to bring forth lost pearls and prophecies that have been overlooked for centuries.There is no denying the truth once it is visible and this book brings visibility to the truth that Prophet Muhammad, peace upon him, was to come as the last Prophet of God as stated by earlier prophets, including but not limited to Jesus and Elijah, peace be upon them both.This book even shows Prophet Muhammad's coming in the buddhist and Hindu texts as well as the Zoroastrians and other religious texts.This book if nothing more than a scholarly work of art, is a priceless asset to any library."
3,Adequate,"This high chair is easily put together, very washable, and gets the job done. However, my son is big in the rump and the seat seems to be a little shallow. He may have difficulty fitting in it as he gets older as he is only 8 months old now."
4,SO FAR SO GOOD...,"I cashed rewards points from work in exchange for this, so didn't buy this highchair, although I do believe Target carries it.So far we have no complaints about the chair, however our son is only 6 moths old and we have been using it for about 2 weeks. The assembly is easy to moderate and I like the fact that the seat cushion is not cloth, making it easy to clean up any spills. The chair has recline options, a nice sized dinner tray and a snack tray. I really like the basket underneth the chair, I use it to keep son's toys in. Overall, a sturdy chair, that has alot of nice features to it. I will add on any updates as we go along."
4,The Hatbox Baby is a find!,"On a sweltering summer morning in 1933, a baby is delivered in a hatbox to Infantorium at the World's Fair & a mystery of love lost & found begins among the freaks & marvels of the Century of Progress Exposition.Somewhere in that hot midwestern city, a young woman is giving birth, with the help of a neighboring midwife, to an infant unlikely to survive. The father, in desperation snatches up the living babe & rushes off to the World's Fair because he'd read about a doctor who could save premature babies.It is the life of this tiny baby, born too early, that brings strangers together in a bond of desperate hope, frantic escapes & heartwarming redemption in a far-away time our grandparents might remember well.A beautifully researched & written adventure of a special time & a particularly strange place. A fascinating read!"
4,fascinating look at institution,"H.G. Wells certainly had conflicting views on the instititution of marriage. In this novel, he sets the characters on a course of self-exploration, and an exploration of the whole idea behind the marriage bond. You may not always agree with Wells, but there is no denying the depth of thinking here. Deeper issues aside, its a very well-written novel that makes you care about the characters."
5,Classic Warren Beatty,"A good movie about being a popular hair stylist in the 70's. If you didn't grown up in the 70's as I didn't, this gives you an idea of what it was like during that period."
2,"Little Ado About ""Shampoo""","This bland attempt at sexual and social satire never gels. ""Shampoo"" captures the Beverly Hills milieu of November 1968, but says little about Nixonian America. Except for Jack Warden's cuckolded Republican tycoon, the characterizations are rather dreary. Warren Beatty goes through the motions as the carnally charged hairdresser. Meanwhile, the acting skills of Julie Christie, Goldie Hawn and Lee Grant go to waste. Hal Ashby's directorial style cannot redeem Beatty and Robert Towne's lackluster script. A major disappointment considering the talent involved."
5,waterpik replacement jet tis brj-4,"These replacement tips are necessary if you press the waterpik tip firmly between your teeth. Tips can get weak and crack, but the tips aren't easy to find in shops."
3,Underworld,"Based on the White-Wolf Vampire the Masquerade universe, but without all the coolness of it. Werewolves look like cat-humans. Not the large scary half-crinos wolf men. It has good moments, cool gadgets and a sequel with better looking were-wolves.The writer worked for WW and wrote a few books for them. She then quite and showed up with this movie and WW sued her pants off."
5,"Great movie, smells like sequel","First off, this wasn't intended to be a vampire/werewolf movie, it was intended to be an action movie with vampires/werewolves. That said, this is a really fun movie! You may have heard it said that all the creator did was splice 'the Matrix' and 'Blade' together, and while i can see why people would think that, the result is, in some ways, greater than the sum of its parts. The characters are good and authentic (thanks to good acting), the story is good, the action is great. What's even better: the last scene all but puts up a neon sign saying ""SEQUEL"". Yay! Although the inevitable sequel won't have the awesomely high originality factor that this, the original, has, it will still be awesome. SO, whether you get this extended version or the original, you will be satisfied."
2,Even worse than remembered.,"So I vaguely remembered seeing Underworld, possibly even in the theaters when it first came out, yet didn't quite recall my final judgement of the film. Then came the glorious Blu-Ray release of the film, well HD viewers, don't waste your time or money. The film itself comes out still appearing too grainy in spots while in others is too dark. I remembered this about my original viewing of the movie and I will say that the HD quality improved it slightly. Foremost in my mind is the overall terrible movie that this is. Bad acting, bad scripting and convoluted plot don't help matters at all. Overall just skip this movie, it will not stand the test of time."
5,Underworld,One of the few movies that you will want to watch over and over again. The ending seemed to imply that there will be a sequel so I'm crossing my fingers for Underworld 2.
2,okay...i guess,"This movie is mostly an effects and popcorn driven thriller , much like van helsing, only it tries to be serious.It's got a good solid premise, a war between supernaturals, which could be far more interesting than most movies where one supernatural wins out, but it never goes anywhere with it.The script, the plot, etc...are all pretty boring and mediocre. The action is also disappointing , as you almost never see vampires and werewolves sparring with their powers, just using guns like regular henchmen.I give it two stars out of generosity.One for visual style--it's got a nicely dark, moody and gothic atmosphere and sets, good for setting mood.And one for kate beckinsale in leather--always a nice addition."
5,subtitulos en español eliminados,"Este DVD a pesar que dice subtitulos disponibles en español en carateristicas tecnica, no los trae tengan cuidado ya que el dvd solo viene en ingles o frances muy mal para amazon de la pelicula excelente e doy un diez"
2,"Please, no sequel!","I'll admit, I'm a sucker for a movie involving the world of vampires. Maybe it's the exquisite hedonism. Maybe it's my curiosity of that ""culture."" Maybe it's just the beautiful makeup effects. However, I expected so much more with this movie.The whole love story that was built up between the two major characters was a major let down in being that for starters, Beckinsale and Speedman didn't come across as having any real chemistry. Also, the love story plot was barely touched upon when I felt they tried to sale the movie on that focal point.The music/score was tacky and somewhat cliched for this movie and while I'm tempted to say the same for the costuming and setting, I liked the lighting used for the movie.There was a twist at the end that was interesting, but predictable. My only hope is that a sequel doesn't follow."
2,Didn't I see this movie already?,"""Underworld"" is a film that rips of from the genre of films like ""The Crow,"" ""Dark City,"" and ""Blade."" It has all the style, effects, and cinematography of these films with nothing new to offer. The plot and acting is completely predictable and contrived. I didn't check out the bonus material because watching this film was already too much of a waste of time. ""Underworld"" somewhat reminded me of(atleast as far as subject content) two great Japanese anime films called ""Vampire Hunter D"" and Vampire Hunter D-Bloodlust"" which I highly recommend instead of this film. I also recommend seeing ""Dark City,"" which was the best film to come out of this genre. Even though I didn't like ""The Crow"" and ""Blade,"" I recommend them above ""Underworld."""
1,"Rather than watch this, I got a better Idea!!!!",Did you ever consider playing pick up sticks with your buttocks?
2,Sigh...i've seen better,"well, this movie was ok, but you can't see anything because it's too dark and there is no lighting in it at all. i feel that movies.ign.com best implemented the problem with this film. it tries to include too many new concepts and ideas into one film about the supernatural or vampires(note: not a direct quote). maybe the reason other people that wrote reviews for this movie enjoyed it more than me was because they were capable of making sense of about 1/8 of it which is more than i could say for myself. you may think this is because of my intelligence or comprehension, some of that maybe true but most was in part of a way too complicated storyline. this movie could have been the second movie of a trilogy, seeing as how the producers and writers and everyone else invloved thought it wouldn't be necessary to explain why anything in the movie was happening."
2,Strictly eye-candy,"If you are looking for a good movie, good storyline, or good scare--look elsewhere. If you are looking for poor imitations of the Matrix and a bad but pretty actress in skin-tight leather, this is your movie."
2,Am I being generous?,"Yes, I think I am. If Kat Beckinsale is supposed to be a vampire, I missed it. Underworld is more like a try hard Matrix than anything else. I never want to hear this in the same sentence as Interview With a Vampire quite simply because Underworld has nothing to do with Vampires. It simply uses them to make a group oppose the warewolves. Kate or 'Selene' actually passes out from lack of blood (funny considering she's supposedly dead), when the light in the mansion goes out, the 'vampires' actually need to carry torches in order to see. And lastly, I've never met a vampire that can;t hear trains in a tunnel before. All in all, this is one of those movies that you watch if you're a fan of 'Dracula 2000'(yes, it;s THAT sad)."
4,Underworld Unrated Blu-Ray,"Underworld (Unrated) [Blu-ray] This is definitely on of the best movies combining Vampires and Werewolves. The special effects are excellent and Kate Beckingsale is excellent as the lead. I enjoyed and own both movies on Blu-Ray. And yes, the action is great and so is the mood of both films. I am waiting for a third in the series.."
4,underworld,I enjoy the esthetics of the show along including the action. Should have got the blue ray version.
2,"Spiffy effects, but boring movie","Not much originality in this film. Mostly it tries to emulate the look, feel, sound, and mood of some better films (""The Matrix"", ""The Crow"", etc).Special effects are very good, but even that can't save a dull script and the slow pacing.There's an old maxim in the theatre that goes, ""If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage."" If the script isn't compelling to read, no amount of spiffy set dressing, effects, etc will elevate it to a higher level. Same here with ""Underworld"". It looks good, but the script anchors it down to sub-par level.A friend loaned me this DVD to watch, so at least I didn't have to shell out any $$ for this."
3,Vampires are so sexy,"I think that's why we're so facinated by them. This story had a little different twist to the gothic, vamp story. This time the vamps weren't hunting us they have other enemies, the wherewolfs! Who knew? Can't we all just get along? All the vamps look good in leather and they always live in a castle, classy! I wonder if any vampire's live in trailer parks? The story moved along. Enjoy!"
1,"""The Matrix"" meets ""Blade"" -- and goes home","This was definitely on my list of the worst films of 2003. A boring monster flick starring Kate Beckinsale (who really is a good actress and should have known better), this movie is ostensibly about an age-old conflict between vampires and werewolves. Instead, it's a remarkably tired and predictable plot that exists mainly as an excuse to show Beckinsale in tight leather. The dialogue is awful, the storyline (ooooh, what a big mystery) was obvious from the first frame, and the climactic battle scene relied on one of those movie moments that's so ridiculous you feel compelled to shout out, ""Oh, COME ON!"" in the middle of the movie theater. To be fair, Bill Nighy did make a suitably creepy villain, but he deserved a better movie to do it in. Pass on this flick and rent one of the movies it tried to rip off -- ""The Matrix"" and ""Blade."" Both of them are far more worthy of your time."
3,It's okay but there's nothing new here,"I love Vampires and Werewolves. I thought it would be great to see an original movie where they had battles. The problem with ""Underworld,"" sadly enough, is it's lack of originality.The ""Vampire clans,"" the look of the vampires and the action scenes have all been done before in better movies.The ""Vampire Clans"" idea has been done before in ""Kindred The Embraced,"" ""Blade,"" and several ""White-Wolf"" roleplaying games. The action sequences were unoriginal and uninspired and the clothes that the Vampires wore were just too stereotypical. Why do all the Vampires in modern films have to be covered head-to-toe in leather?I like the movie because I love Vampires and Werewolves but I think the movie would have been a lot better if it had some more originality. This is mainly for the diehard Vampire (or Werewolf) fans. Buy this at the Hollywood Video's ""Two for $20.00"" sale if you are only a casual action/horror fan."
1,nonsense,"This movie makes no sense.....Unless watching a bunch of actors wear nice trendy clothes posing here and there (the vampires) makes sense to anybody else & the plot is so ridiculous you cant help but laugh...This could've been so much more, with the vampire vs werewolf concept and all, somewhere in the terrirory of 'blade II' or something."
3,so so movie....,"These days its hard to go to a movie without seeing matrix spawned CGI effects, but this one does not shy away from it. The movie is filled with CGI, now i am not saying that i dont like CGI im just saying that from time to time they need to cut down. Anyways i gave it 3 stars because of the action, the plot was unoriginal vampires vs. warewolfes or they describe them as likens. CONTENT: feeding from warewolfes and vampires, decapitation, shooting, swords, I also would like to add that becksale or however you spell her name is a very hot vampire."
4,Vampires and Werewolves--oh my!!,"Other than a loud and annoying soundtrack, I truely enjoy this film. I thought the story managed a unique twist on an old theme. Sure there are shots that look as though it belonged in the Matrix but all in all it works. I'm not saying that there aren't a few plot holes or that the movie isn't riddled with coincidences--it is. I mean the finally fight between Victor and Michael was as anticlimatic as one could get. We finally get this vampire/werewolf hybrid and Victor kicks his butt. Selene turns out to be all anyone needs. But hey, all the fighting poses were sleek and elegant. More like dancing than fighting. If you enjoy vampire stories--this film should still make your must see list."
4,Great Movie / Response To Some Past Reviews,"I really enjoyed this movie. Vampires rocked. I read some of the reviews. I see so many people complaining how ""weak"" the vampires were. Look at Viktor, look how strong he was. He fought with the werewolf towards the end then stabbed him with his sword. People say there was no blood drinking. Twice you see blood going into Viktor, once to awake him and once to regain his physical appearance. I can't wait for the sequels. Great movie!!!"
4,"Good, But Not Great","First of all this movie tackled a very hard plot about a war that has existed between vampires and lycans(werewolves) for many years. I thought they did a really good job considering the unbelievable plot that they tackled. The character development in the movie was fair but it seemed as if at times the acting was a little bit to melodramatic. The movie focused mainly on the vampire culture and did not focus much on the werewolves. The graphics were excellent and the werewolves looked great. I recommend that you rent this before you buy it, it is a great DVD to watch but you may want to review it yourself before purchasing."
4,A real pleasure.,Kate Beckinsale in leather. Kick-ass AQ. Vampires vs. Werewolfs. Turn up the surround sound on this one.
4,UNDERWORLD,Underworld (Full Screen Special Edition)Arrived ahead of time; Really enjoyed the movie. I love the series. You don't mind that their werewolves or vampires; excellent chacter development.
1,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen,"My sister rented this a few weeks ago telling me I would really like it, (she had seen it before.) She was definatly wrong. When everyone is not killing each other there is a plot that makes hardly any sense. My dad, who usually likes movies like this wasn't able to sit through it. For the most part it's just a lot of violence with no meaning. I'd never watch it again, and I definatly suggest not to buy it because there are so many other, better, movies out there. Anything is better then this. I really like Kate Beckansile, but I don't know why she would waste her acting abilities in this movie."
3,Birthday gift for my daughter,"This is a nice gift, but we keep misplacing the pieces. There have been times where she has had a hard time getting the pieces to fit. We have decided to wait a little while longer before we take this toy back out for her to play with it."
4,Not for children,"This is a great game, but it's too complex for kids under 13. I got original Tropico when I was about 11, and I was pretty confused. After many tedious hours of playing this game I figured out enough to not get kicked out of office or be invaded by the U.S. after a few years, allowing me to experience the more fun aspects of the game. This game is similar to sim city because you need to keep your people healthy, enducated, safe, and employed(and happy). It also adds new challenges like keeping good relations with the United States and Russia, political factions, and winning elections (or rigging them). What I'm trying to say is; if you like city sims and you understand politics, get this game."
2,beautiful but lofty,"The photos are beautiful as promised. But if you're really looking for a sourcebook of ideas for your home, as this one claims to be, you may be disappointed. This book treats stone and tile with nearly religious reverence; all I wanted was something nice for the kitchen! Some of the treatments are absurdly elaborate, and the text even analyzes the provenance of many of the stones. More creative people might find inspiration here, but for me it was much ado about nothing."
2,DAVID'S DISAPPOINTING DOODLES,"David Leavitt is getting lazy. This book was embarrassingly mediocre and unworthy of the talent that gave us Family Dancing and Lost Language of Cranes. C'mon David, get back to WORK!"
3,Good for beginners,"Fairly good book, but mostly for beginners. The general approach is no-nonsense, well explained and very tilted towards indexing, as in the Random Walk. Unfortunately, for non-US readers, the last tilt is not very helpful since there are few available indexed vehicles to use for investing in emerging markets. Personally (I am a pro in investment, but with no specific expertise in EM) I did not find a lot I did not know already. Also I am skeptical of the application of Peter Lynch's growth-to-P/E ratio to comparisons between paired advanced- and emerging-market stocks. As a lesson in sensical approaches to long-term investing I still much prefer the Walk."
1,Stopping Scoliosis: not a reason to have hope,"I was thrilled to receive this book, however after readng it cover to cover I was saddened by the one sided view.There are other ways to heal scoliosis (and other serious conditions) without surgery, one just has to look!My daughter was dissappointed in the bias stories and how everyone ends up with rods. Dr. Harrington wouldshudder at the fact that his invention is the only cure with today's technology."
4,It's entertaining and fun.,Fun movie to watch. It's even ok to watch over again. I do have a question though. How in the world did Reggie survive all of the shots into the van? Was he was able to anchor himself to the top of the van while the Bucum was shooting?
4,Convenience,This was a good buy for the convenience and packaging. They are getting the job done of lighting my emergency candles.
4,"Not just a calendar, but a great source of ideas","This isn't just another guide to holidays and anniversaries. Chase's list is extensive, making this an indispensable resource for event planners, activity directors, advertising, and media professionals. As a former librarian working in advertising and marketing, I found this publication to be a popular source for creative ideas for special events, and for brainstorming in a team environment when everyone is stuck on doing the same old thing. I recently recommended this title to the events planner where I currently work. The price may seem high, but considering the volume of information, and the inclusion of a CD-Rom, this book is less expensive than many other directories."
5,Brando at his best,"I hate to admit it, but I never really got the whole Brando thing. Then again, I really only had The Godfather to base that on-and I'm not really a mafia-movie chick. This is film making at its finest. Brando shines-and was clearly a pretty boy in his time. Strong script and great performances by both Brando and Steiger. While I like the ""contender"" scene, I think it paled to the scene when Terry is trying to connect with Edie in the bar/cafe scene. Overall-great film. If you haven't had a chance to see it-do yourself a favor."
3,a voice against,"A classic I felt I had to see-it was good, Marlon Brando was good and passionate in his classic role. But I never really felt it was the achievement in filmmaking it has come to represent. Viewing such films, for more, is more an essential exercise in cultural literacy in order to understand other, later, references to them. For instance, the oft-quoted, ""I coulda been a contender..."" or references such as in the Lloyd Cole song (later redone by Tori Amos) ""Rattlesnakes"", which states, ""She looks like Eva Marie Saint/ in On the Waterfront"". These references are lost to the uninitiated. Does it mean I thoroughly enjoyed or appreciated the film? No. I enjoyed the performances, enjoyed the social commentary and the voice against corruption in general. I am sure this could have been and is a powerful film; it just wasn't for me. But that's my taste or lack thereof."
1,"DVD Special Edition of ""ON The Waterfront"" Misleading",Ordered and Received from Amazon this edition - a sham Special Edition one of the great American film classics. The aspect ratio is not the director's. It is your Supper Market supper cheapo version. 1:33:1 ratio. Shame on Amazon for not making this clear. Perhaps we should blame Columbia Pictures for putting out the product to begin with given the poor quality of the picture as well as using the full screen aspect ratio. Nevertheless Amazon should have given the above important imformation in their description.
3,Not all unions were MOB run,"This movie has some great acting in it.But looking back, it may have been somewhatmisguided as the ""union toughs"" were actually important inresisting the ""management toughs"" of hired thugs and security guardsused to break unions.In many states unions were broken and the workers suffered at the will of management.The coal mines of West Virginia are probably one outstandinghistorical example with black lung disease and long hours, bad safety conditions and no real representation of workers.The dock workers and teamsters were MOB run, but many others unions in the trades suffered from ""piece work"" and union breaking tactics , even to the present.We don't picture the Marlon Brando of this story as being a corporatestooge in breaking unionism, but that may have been the ultimate result?"
2,Hopelessly Antiquated,"Another victim of the bewildering practice of forcing older movies to be shown in the useless black and white format; knowing that computers can add vibrant colors to these movies, and that studios fail to take advantage of it, is extremely saddening. There are likely thousands of new viewers (who, like me, can't stand black and white) who will be turned off by this close-minded practice.Let's all band together and tell the studios what we want: classic movies looking as good as possible! And in bright, beautiful colors!"
2,Not good,There are 2 types of people who like black and white films: old people and clever clogs know-it-alls. Why watch this when you can buy Picture Perfect with the lovely Jennifer Aniston for the same price. The emperor's new clothes!
5,one of the best,"On the Waterfront is justly considered one of the best films in hollywood. But most don't realize that it was based on a true story -- that of Father John Corrdian S.J. He was the 'waterfront priest' working ny and nj ports in the late 40's and 50's trying to help Catholic longshoremen from the tranny of the mob and others abusing the local unions on the waterfront. Fr John or 'Pete' as he was called, is a great example of how a good Catholic Priest can be a manly and strong force to help save others."
3,Product satisfaction,"Movie need to be in blueray for better sound quality. The cover does not match this one you have displayed, which makes me think I purchased a dubbed copy."
5,Haunting thriller...,"I saw this movie on the big screen in 1988. I loved it then..and I love it now. It's a dark, intellectual, emotionally draining, and completely enjoyable thriller. Demi Moore does a fantastic job playing a pregnant neo-Madonna, in search of answers about her haunting dreams and odd renter. Bit-by-bit, the movie uncovers the secret of the ""seven signs,"" and teases us with flashbacks of ancient times. The ending is only predictable seconds before it happens, but the movie keeps our brains working as we second guess the next scene. Out of all the movies I've ever seen, only three or four would rate four or five stars. I suprise myself by including this one amoung them because it's not my typical movie genre. If you hate typical blood, guts, and gore thrillers (Friday the 13th, Scream, and Halloween), look into this one."
4,Love this video,saw this video years ago on vhs....ordered it on dvd and watched it again for the first time in probably 20 years. Still love it! It is a very good movie. They should reissue it in theaters....same problems going on in our world now.
4,The Bible Serves as Fodder for Head on Thriller,"Demi Moore plays Mary to Jurgen Prochnow's Jesus in this dark and elaborately filmed psychological phenomenon. Married to Lawyer - Michael Biehn, Moore is a pregnant and depressed housewife/artist who is thrust into a Biblical nightmare beyond her wildest imaginings. As Prochnow's character breaks each of the ""seven seals"", the worst of God's punishments is visited upon mankind. How can Moore, in her state of depression lift herself above the fray and overcome the power of the Seventh Sign?"
2,"Great book, just poor workmanship",I ordered this book and had to return it right away because the print was cut off on the bottom of many of the pages making the book unreadable. I re-ordered the book and the same thing. I will look elsewhere to purchase the book because I really want to read this book. :(
4,Butch and Spike,"I thought this book was okay. It was way better compared to My Side of the Mountain, one of my required and very boring summer reading books. The book is about the two Couture cousins, Butch and Spike, who are the two ""main enemies"" of Jasper Gordan, a straight A student in Theodore Elvin Elementary School. Jasper sits in between them, acting as a ""role model"" for them and his class. During the story, a couple of crazy things occured, like when the two cousins went skinny dipping on a field trip when Mrs. McNulty(AKA Mrs. McNutt)lost her patience with them.I thought the book was sort of funny because you can tell that Butch is the one who gets hurt a lot and Donny is the great baseball player. I think some people should read this book."
2,Not what I thought it would be,When I ordered Bejeweled & Alchemy (Mac) I thought it was Bejeweled 2 Deluxe. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that has. I was somewhat disappointed.
5,Awesome hat,I love when I buy something online and it actually looks in person like it does online. Awesome hat; Ive been wanting one for a while now. SOOO happy and the shipping was crazy fast.Thanks!!
4,Lots of fun,This ball pit is big. It's a lot of fun for preschoolers. My 2 year old loves it. And what a bonus that it is Sesame Street! The balls do end up ALL OVER the place. But that is to be expected with a ball pit. Good value. One point: there is no way to blow it up without an air compressor. I couldn't imagine trying to blow it up with your mouth! :)
1,Sesame Street Ball Pit,"What a waste of money! I gave this as a birthday gift and unfortunately, the parents opened it up at the party. It was embarrasing! The image shows a much larger ball pit. The two little ones could hardly fit in it together let alone play. It also didn't come with nearly enough balls in it and the cheap plastic balls that they did provide dented up once they were stepped on. I have never been so humiliated! Had I any idea, I NEVER would have given this as a gift."
2,Disapointed,"My daughter loves Elmo so I had to get this for her!We got it, blew it up(that took for ever) and she was so excited to see it. First off there is NO slide, why call it a slide? Next after playing in it for an hour I noticed that the front was collapsing. I inflated it again, an hour later it was deflated again. We tried to find a leak and could not. So now it sits on my porch in the corner unused. My 2 year old is so dissapointed"
2,The Deep End,"The movie had a great foundation but was lost in stupidity. I ended up hating the stupid control freak mother, vapid grandfather, puny hit henchman...; What little scenery I saw was great. All through the movie, I wanted to slap most of the characters, especially the mother and tell her to wake up and get real. The only real characters were the son's lover, the little kids, and the money-grubbing really bad guy. She hadn't the guts to tell the naval operator that her call was an emergency just to get through to her husband so he could help her do his job in raising the kids (no wonder he was on a destroyer). I could have done a better job in writing this movie."
2,Not a very smart thriller,"A mildly interesting storyline is let down by an amateurish screenplay, unbelievable plot and uninvolving characters. Tilda Swinton otherwise is a fine English actress however in addition to adopting an American accent she adopts a pained blank expression whenever she tries to connote emotion - well if this worked we would all think that Kristin Scott Thomas was a fine actress."
5,Wonderful!,"This is wonderful! I love Freddy Fender's music, and this just really features his beautiful voice and interpretation of lyrics. It features a collection of classic trio music. I keep this one on repeat for the whole work day. Everyone that comes in comments on the soothing quality of the music and how it takes them back in time. They are always surprised that it is Freddy Fender."
3,A decent book... BUT,"While this book is perhaps one of Edred's best work to date, I would like to point out that he is actually more into Satanism than anything runic. A lot of his dark philosophical beliefs permeate the work. You have been forewarned."
3,"brilliant music, mediocre mix","I have been listening to this CD for about 3 weeks now and I must say it is quite enjoyable. The track selection is nearly impeccable and would be perfect if not for track 11 which seems almost comical in its excessive melodrama. Furthermore, Yost's mixing seems hustled at times and unworthy of such extraordinary songs. The overall innovative sound, however, makes the CD worthy of purchase."
3,"Not the best, but not bad","First, let me say, I have been a huge fan of Billy's since 1990. I have attended concerts, bought T-shirts, and played his music full blast on many a day.The album contains a few gems, a few mediocre songs, and a few that are painful to hear. Being a HUGE fan of the British Isles, I found the song ""Take Down the Union Jack"" to inspire a bit of melancholy and a bit of acceptance...the Isles have changed.Other songs like ""Baby Farouk"", ""Distant Shore"", and ""Tears of My Tracks"", bring you to remember some of his older albums quite fondly.This album is fairly decent, but is missing something. Compared to William Bloke this is one notch below. This album most directly corresponds to Don't Try This at Home...So, if you are a Billy Bragg fan, you should buy this album (if only for Take Down the Union Jack). If you have never listened to Billy before, then I suggest you go pick up Back to Basics or William Bloke before hand."
5,"This is magic ""soundtrack music""","I have an inclination for instrumental music of many sorts: new age, ethnic (now world music), lounge, some chill out and a variety of new ""tags"" of instrumental music. I hear it as today's calssical music in some respects.I heard two songs of this record in a music store a couple of years ago, got the name of it and brought the piece of paper in my wallet for a long time. I was just looking for an excuse, for something to celebrate. I finally thought recently that it was time to buy it.When I finally heard it for the first time in full, a whole range of emotions and good vibrations went through me. And it only got betters as I listen it again. Many times I just play it while I read or do other minor things at home, and it becomes for a moment the beautiful soundtrack of that day."
5,Powerful intellectual and ethical exercise...,"This is one of my favorite films from the '60's, and I saw a superb stage production of it as well, two years before the film version. Sir Thomas More, chancellor of England, is asked to choose between his King and his Catholic Church. He refuses to take a side, publicly, but everyone in the nation knows he opposes King Henry's decision to break with the Pope so that he can marry another wife. How More (Paul Schofield) tries to stay alive via a silence that shouts a rebuke makes for compelling drama. A young Robert Shaw does a flamboyant and wonderful job as King Henry, but then, the entire supporting cast, as is common in British productions, is great. Faith and greed, power and the loss of it, survival and sacrifice...all are elements of this fine film."
3,this movie inspires me to review my choices on morality,this movie was morally compelling i feel it was great movie that makes me take a look back in my life and review my choices.it makes u think that if he would give his life up for an issue of morality that could have just been ended with a signiture.what choices do i make without thinking of the consequences or without thinking of the situation at hand. would i be willing to give my life. the truth is i dont think so which makes what thomas moore did that much more special. all in all it was a great film and taught me alot about the choices we make in life and the consequences of those choices.
5,A Movie for All Seasons.,"A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS is a motion picture based on the later years of Sir Thomas More (author of UTOPIA among many other things). The film opens with a messenger delivering a summons to Sir Thomas from the Chancellor and Archbishop of England. The Archbishop was played by Orson Welles and though I strongly admire the work of Mr. Welles, he looks like a giant ocean liner in this picture. Anyway, the film quickly moves from one event to the next. The Archbishop dies and More replaces him as the King's Advisor, an argument errupts between King Henry and More over Henry's maritial affairs, and eventually everyone turns against More, ending with his execution.I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The costumes are magnificent and the scenery breathtaking. What is most enjoyable is More's wit. The film is more (pardon the pun) for the intellectual and not for morons. A great movie."
1,complete loss. While removing disc from the case it broke into three pieces.,While removing the disc from its case it broke into three pieces. So...no view or review. Complete loss to me.
5,perhaps the best movie ever,"It's not an easy film to watch. Once a year is probably a good interval to wait between viewings. It is a very important film, especially these days, but also so well constructed, it overwhelms you. aesthetivally wonderful, perfect as a Beethoven Sonata or his 9th. It is difficult to be articulate about a film this good. You need to watch it, everyone should. A masterpiece. That's it."
5,Not Disappointed,"Timeless. The story's still powerful, the performances still splendid in spite of the passage of time since the film's first release. That's quite a treat. This is an historic drama with wit, intelligence and a refreshing lack of heavy handedness.On another note it's great fun to see ""early editions"" of some of the cast. Leo McKern (Cromwell) was Rumpole even then and who could have imagined Robert Shaw (Henry) as the shark hunter in ""Jaws""? Come to think of it, fortry years ago who could have imagines ""Jaws""?Too often seeing the re-release of an old favorite has left me wondering what I liked about it in the first place. Not so A Man for All Seasons. Great flick then, great flick now!"
2,Printhead Problems,"I brought this printer about a year ago and it has work great since than. I only used the printer serveral times per week. Most recently the printhead went out. I talked with cannon technical support and I found out that you can only buy the printhead from cannon at 49.00 plus tax and shipping. By the way the print head is not guaranteed, so if you buy it, you better be sure that is really the problem."
5,BEST PRINTER EVER!!,The Canon s750 has got to be the BEST printer available at such a great price. For the great low price you get all you ever need. Whether you are replacing an old printer or purchasing your first printer. You HAVE to buy this one. You wont be disapointed. It prints at high speeds and prints clear and crisp. So from me to you BUY THIS TODAY AND DONT DELAY..I'M NOT KIDDING FOLkS..
