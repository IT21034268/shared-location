5,YOU HAVE TO OWN THIS ONE !!!!!,Very short and sweet... this is the funniest stand up I have ever seen in my life.
5,Blue Collar Comedy Tour-The Movie,I received the item in a timely fashion and in excellent conditiom. We truly enjoyed this DVD and will continue to buy from Amazon.com.
5,you might need to laugh if,"I had no idea what to expect with this movie and thought I would hate it, boy was I wrong! I have watched this several times since each time I hear something I missed because I was laughing to hard to hear it the time before. This should come with an advisory not to eat or drink or even expect to breathe for long periods of time. I would recommend a trip to the bathroom before you start this movie also. And be warned you will be prone to fits of laughing as you think back of bits in the movie."
5,Prompt Delivery!,I received it in just a few days and it was in excellent condition. Good job! I love amazon.
5,Bond,This is one of the funniest standup shows I have seen. Ron White made some jokes from the phoenix area that were funny because its true. Larry the cable guy just as many laughs. All four of them are funny this is one that I would recommend to any one even if you never seen it before its worth getting A TOP TEN ON MY LIST.
5,Blue Collar Comedy Tour 3,This is an hilarious pack - even incredibly funny for the Australian humour - this may seem strange to Aussies as American humour isn't to most of us - give it a try - I laughed until I cried.
5,Never laughed so hard in my life,This has got to be one of the funniest things I've ever watched in my life. It's the kind of comedy that makes your abs and jaw hurt the next day from laughing so hard.
4,Blue Collar Comedy Tour,"You know you're a redneck if you watch the ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"". Seriously this is a funny movie. They took material from their tours and edited to make a movie. I enjoyed their stand-up routines. If you enjoy their comedy you should certainly enjoy the movie. Includes a few scenes of them interviewing people on the street. The DVD quality is good and it has fair replayability."
3,NOT WIDE-SCREEN,"The content is excellent. However, the DVD is not widescreen and has been REFORMATTED. I do not believe that a widescreen (the original format of the film) DVD is available. I am planning to return my purchase."
5,"""Come here you Devil-log""","One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Despite the fact that Heavyweights is targeted at a younger generation, this movie ranks as one of my all-time favorites. The plot is hillariious, and Ben Stiller does a downright amazing job. Watch for the little innuendo's that Heavyweights throws in there for the ""big"" kids; such as a beginning scene where the kids arrive in their big yellow school-bus. The scene slow-mo's with a direct allusion to Schindler's list... It's these little nuances that help push this movie over-the-top. A must buy!"
2,Mediocrity,"Heavyweights was a quite a disappointment, considering the presence of Ben Stiller.The movie sheds light on a popular summer camp for fat children that unexpectedly finds itself under different management. The new administration will make it clear very soon that some major changes are to take place...The plot and the acting are surprisingly (!) average, while the humor and the dialogues are below average.Ben Stiller's character, a cross between Zoolander and Dodgeball (both being AMAZING movies), was unexpectedly plain and bland.As for the rest of the cast, this film does not seem to be their thing.Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really... No masterpiece here."
1,Boring,This bored me and my son. We both fell asleep. I felt this was just pushed out without much thought put into it.
1,Will not prevent theft!!,"These locks might stop a 10 year old from attempting to steal your racks. Don't bother with them. If someone wants your beautiful Thule rack, they will take it whether these dinky locks are there or not. Save yourself $54 and don't bother."
4,SUPER MOVIE,VERY GOOD MOVIE GREAT FOR YOUNG PRE TEEN GIRLS! WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. MY DAUGHTER HAS WATCHED THIS OVER AND OVER.
2,No breathing room,I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I thought it was going to be about the horrible events after the disaster. Instead it was mostly about soviet policy and things of that nature. I found it kind of boring.
5,Provokes a renewed appreiciation of American freedom.,"Grigori Medvedev presents an accurate, disturbing account of censorship and secrecy in the USSR. In his struggle to publish warnings of impending disaster (Chernobyl) Medvedev is met with resistance which Americans cannot fathom. Threats of imprisonment, death, and dicreditation are all too common to an author and scientist simply trying to prevent catastrophe. Medvedev's persistence is most commendable, and is his faith in God very apparent. Such courage, faith, and intelligence is far too rare in the world and Grigori's struggle makes U.S. freedom all the more gratifying."
1,Improperly Labled Product,"The product is advertised as ""Clear Plastic Clean/Polish"" which I wanted, but the picture of the product is ""Clear Plastic Detailer,"" which I didn't want. ""Clear Plastic Detailer"" is what showed up. Waste of 11-bucks..."
2,Would nt buy again,Heard this was great - very similar to Orvis lead...neither my husband or my dog could get used to it.
1,"Daily Dilenshiister: Just in, aware boy doesn't use shampoo!","He takes one or two showers a week, but hasn't washed his hair in years because he ""does not want it to be poofy"". That's just how he likes it, slick and greasy. Next week, we will have an extensive catalog available of the species that are currently inhabiting the unsightly rotten carcass that he calls hair. Why buy a book from such a dirty person?"
1,In the words of my brother...,"My brother told me about this book, and I read it. Only his words could put it best: (on talking about Geoff) ""After reading his 'book' , i wanted to scalp him. ""."
1,Buy a different model/brand,"I had two of these units in my house. They seem to be engineered to fail just beyond the 5 year warranty. In both cases, the units complained about a low battery condition and refused to clear the warning when a new battery was installed."
4,Good product,I've been using this product for a year now. I have a total of 3 units in my house. All are working as they suppose to. No complain so far.
4,"nice, practical glasses",they fit well and are very light. they provide good protection and are quite stylish for something that is padded and floats.
1,"Thou shalt not waste hard earned $$$ to see ""The Ten""","OMG,after reading the other two reviews I just had to weigh in on this film.I saw this film last week and decided that it was probably not worth the time to review it.After reading braver souls than I, I now have the courage to put in my 1 star.My least favorite commandment among them all was ""Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother.""A white woman and her husband give birth to twin black boys which grow up to learn that Arsenio Hall was their true father! Oh brother was that one stupid.I,also, have got to say that this movie was by far the most nonsensical mumbo-jumbo that I have seen in a long time.What was the goal of this film? It left me stunned at how cheesy and low brow it was.I,too, agree that this film seemed to have no purpose.If there was one, then it was lost in translation.Unfortunately, I did pay $11 to see this.SHOW ME THE MONEY."
1,Smarmy and painfully unfunny,"I normally am not moved to type out a review of a movie, but after having watched the first 15 or so minutes of this P.O.S., I felt compelled to render an opinion. I don't think I've seen a movie that went to such lengths to hit its audience over the head with how witty it was, when in fact it really wasn't at all humorous or clever. Whoever was responsible for how this thing turned out (the writers? the director?) should think twice about pursuing a career in film-making."
3,Not a total waste of time,"I can watch a movie with dry humor; I just usually don't go for movies loaded with such crude sexual content. But the absurdity of every situation was so extreme, I got caught up in the anticipation of seeing what stupidity the writers would come up with next.The movie is like the cliched train wreck. It's such a horrible thing, but you can't look away. Was it funny? I had a few chuckles, but no good laughs. Do I recommend the movie? Yes, if you like the sort of movie that does its best to creep out sensible people or if you want to see every movie Jessica Alba has had even a bit part in. No, if you have any sensibilities or are easily offended by crude sexual or irreverent content."
4,The Ups & One Down of the Micro Pro Steamer,"Small & compact, which was the purpose of the purchase. Overall a decent design, the steamer got the job done. The downside, which really isn't bad if you're on holiday with no time schedule, but could be a problem for the business traveller, is that the Steamer takes a long time to heat up; especially compared with others tried in the past.But if being somewhere on time doesn't invlove a flurey and rushing out the door, & packing lightly is a factor (don't worry, it takes too long to heat up for TSA to try it when they search luggage at the airport), then this little steamer is a charm."
4,Steamer,"The product is light weight and great for traveling. However, it does not put out as much steam as I had hoped. It takes too long to actually steam press an article of clothing."
3,"valuable, but not a good choice for a first book on Jung","Boundaries of the Soul seems to have stood the test of time, especially in updated form, and it does give one a nice sense of a Jungian practice at work. However, Singer's writing style is uneven and meandering, and unless the reader already has a reasonably good conception of Jung's thought as a whole, much of this volume may feel like navigating in an entirely new country without a map. The book's fairly substantial lenth makes this even more of an issue. For an introduction to Jung, it would be best to look elsewhere, and then come back to Singer."
3,A little redundant but great to have laying around,"The book is redundant in that it is a book of quotes from, yes, the movie with the same name. And probably most people who are interested in the book will own the movie. Or will have seen it so many times that they can already quote it. I like the book, though. It's funny, everyone gets a kick out of it, and you just can't get enough of Napolean."
4,Napoleon wins another,"Very funny. Great reminder of the highlights in the movie. I bought this for my wife as she is a fan of the movie, and she read it cover to cover and laughed loud and often."
5,This book is a must have for all Napoleon fans!,This book is a must have for all Napoleon fans! . . . . . . . . . .
1,A One star rating given due to a lack of negative numbers...,"The subject at hand, the sleaze of the Hollywood elite and how ""they"" are trying to infect the rest of us with it, is presented in a (so-called) writing ""style"" that was last seen in the pages of the Enquirer prior to the election Richard Nixon.The constant references to ""the heterosexual Tom Cruise"" were enough to gall, as if anyone truly cared if he is or is not.While I understand the point that was being made, or rather, attempted to be made, and even agree with it to some extent, whatever was the point of writing an entire book railing about Hollywood sleaze in a manner that can only be described AS sleaze???If a titillating tale is your cup of tea, I would suggest Hollywood Babylon (1 or 2) by Kenneth Anger, rather than this tripe."
1,Tabloid gossip passed off as social science,"This poorly written mess of a book presents the premise that leftist Hollywood celebrities are too screwed up to be role models for their own children, much less the rest of us. Unfortunately the sampling of old tabloid stories of dubious truth are compounded by constant contradictions to the premise. So some stars are good single parents, some are absent parents, some are neurotic ex-hippies. Is this not true perhaps, of say, parents in Idaho?The fact that entertainment welcomes more eccentric personalities to it's fold than perhaps accounting does not necessarily mean they create them. Some kids get screwed up whether dad is Marlon Brando or George Bush. Among the many problems with this sloppy book is the fact that in spite going back to the ancient movie scandal history, most contemporary juicy details are about family members of recent ""celebrities"" we already can't really place."
1,More right wing propoganda,"Thank God I got this book from the Beverly Hills Library instead of buying it. If I had taken one look at the jacket cover, I wouldn't have even checked it out for free. First thing, one of the authors works for Matt Drudge. Second, one of the reviews on the back cover comes dangerous right-wing schizo Ann Coulter. I made it through about the first 40 pages. It's all typical one-sided Rush Limbaugh-style rhetoric. However you feel about celebrities, this is just a vitriolic hate piece with questionable documentation. If you're a right-wing extremist and you hate celebrities - this is the book for you. Be my guest."
1,Relentless Trash,"If you like reading gossip rags at a supermarket checkout counter, this book is for you, but don't expect anything more. Much of this gossip isn't even fresh. For instance, Polanski's story is decades old. Other sections could have been lifted from People magazine. What's new is ugly or petty.I expected some balance or some redeeming features when I see something like this in book form, but there was nothing. This book is one long session of carping, and the writes come off as bad as the people they are writing about. It takes a certain kind of mindset to enjoy this nasty worldview."
3,Too Much Information,"Hollywood Interrupted got off to an interesting start but lost my interest about halfway through. The book is basically an expose on the insanity of the Hollywood culture in general and specifically the celebs themselves. Much of the material is what you've already glanced at in the celeb magazines in the grocery store checkout aisles but with a little more detail and a little more harsh. Although I'm a fan of Breitbart and enjoyed his most recent book, this one was a disappointment. The bottom line was that the book merely detailed trivial information about Hollywood and celebs behaving badly. The truth is that I didn't care enough to want to keep reading. The book's basic thesis is right--Hollywood is whacked and why do we care about it as much as we do?"
5,Hollywood--Hardcore,"Forget the ""juicy gossip"" -- this book hits Hollywood hard and where it hurts, pointing out hypocrisies, cover ups and lies, with wit, humor and a sarcastic sense of outrage. It's more than just gossip--it's a cradle to the grave outline of how Hollywood celebs who screw up their lives are allowed to dictate policy from fashion and child care to religion and politics and how the mass media allows them to keep up this tastemaker inanity, never questioning the stars' talking points. Don't get me wrong--there are great pieces of guilty pleasure (the action hero who videotapes himself ""decorating"" a pair of shoes then mails the footwear and the tape to his cyber stalker;the adventures of B-list actors selling pots and pans to audiences at county fairs; the Dr. Feelgoods, etc., for example)and quick turns of phrase that make this the ultimate smart star-lit read. It's intelligent, fun and informative, read it for pleasure, and you'll learn a lot--painlessly."
1,"Idea isn't bad, but the execution stinks.","In competent hands this could have been a good book. Good Hollywood books make the top ten. These lousy authors can only dream about it.The authors claim they want to debunk the cult of celebrity. Instead they try to suggest they are superior to it in a moralistic and boring tone. Even worse, these two half-wits don't make a whole. They use old tabloid tattle as evidence then sneer and snarl. Dullsville.I got the idea they are trying to tout this book as the antidote to the cult of celebrity. Instead they are part of the problem, not part of the solution.This book is a waste of time and money."
2,Very disappointing,"I usually like reading about the seamy, scandalous side of show business but this is a bad job of reporting. There is far too much editorializing and with aone-sided socially conservative stance. Bad behavior in the entertainment industry is not limited to liberals.The book is far too opinionated as if the facts can't stand by themselves.The authors have a moralistic tone rather than an entertaining one and they come off as holier-than-thou. If they think Tom Cruise is homosexual (if that is so important to them), why don't they have the courage to say so directly instead of bitchy, multiple oblique references to ""heterosexual Tom Cruise"".I tried to finish it but it got to be too tedious."
3,Hoyle Word Games,My wife needed something to stimulate her thinking besides the other games she was playing. A little hard learning the playing rules but otherwise was an okay game.
2,Even non-Americans must be skeptical about reality TV!,"Though this was in Spanish, it might as well have been speaking of reality shows in the US. Here, contestants are put through things just to keep viewers watching. Contestants have their own exhibitionist and self esteem issues. Some contestants are obviously chosen to play stereotypical roles based upon their identities, etc. This movie asks, ""When are these shows going over the line?""I believe this work was made in Chile. I am very disappointed about the homogeneity of the cast. I heard that Chile is racially diverse having indigenous people, Spaniards, and many of mixed heritage. In this film, all the characters looked 100% European. No Chileans with any drop of indigenous ancestry were given roles. I find this very problematic. Critics have said that Latin American TV and film often act like people of African or Amerindian ancestry don't exist and this film is glaring proof of that. For shame!"
3,The chains seem flimsy,"I have had a very hard time finding these type of baskets. After reading other reviews and examining the baskets myself, I decided to follow the advice I read on other reviews... replace the chains."
4,Keeps you involved!,I really liked this book and how it revolved around a family; their support for each other in spite of many difficulties led to a believable tale. I read this during a time of extreme cold weather and it was a great book to curl up with.
5,Nice surprise,"This was a great book. A quick page turner. I finished it in 2 days. I loved the characters, the dialogue, the story....It wasn't quite what you'd expect, which made it good.Worth the time!"
5,Adding this one to my permanent collection!,So much has already been said about this book that I don't really know what I could add. It's a great story with a mysterious combination of being both light and magical yet also deep and tragic. I have a feeling I'll never find another book like this one again.
5,Through the eyes of a child,"In the tradition of To Kill a Mockingbird, A Day No Pigs Would Die and Wringer, we find another youngster capable of touching our hearts with his story. Reuben Land and gives us the clear-eyed, though often naive truth. My favorite part...I have so many marked! I have often used Reuben's oh-so-honest commentary on his trial testimony to help hook adults on the book. Enger gives us a loyal, surviving family that proves our family is not always our blood."
4,Wonderful Read,This was excellent book with great storytelling and lyrical style of prose. The narrator's voice is that of an 11 year old boy and rings very true. This is a quality read.
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I had to read this book for my English class, now normally I love reading... I read on average 5-15 books a month. But this book took me at least 3 weeks to read because I couldn't stand reading it for more than a half hour at a time. The plot isn't very exciting, and you never get very attached to the characters. The only character you ever have any sight into his feelings is Reuben. Unless you have to read this book, I wouldn't."
4,Such pleasure. From an Author with such talent.,"This book is so lovely from the first sentence that you will have to put it down (reluctantly) once in a while in order to reconnect with reality. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is not Huckleberry Finn, To Kill a Mockingbird, or Lonesome Dove. But, gosh, it is sure beautifully written. Enger's use of the English language, both to place his reader in the setting, and to place the characters in the heart of the reader, is prodigious. I am an atheist, but I accepted the miracles. Now, THAT is writing.Enger's writing is so precise and quiet that you care deeply about these people, even before you realize you know who they are. It's been a privilege and a pleasure to participate in the reading of Peace Like a River. No hack writing here. Read this book."
5,If you had a 6 star rating...,"I read a lot and rarely stop to write a review. But this book is so profound, moving, highly readable, and memorable that I can't not let others know. A work of art... I wish I could rate it more than 5 stars."
2,Moses and Jesus,"I don't mind flights of fancy as long as they are launched in the known universe. The characters were never true to themselves and the plot wandered as if the author wasn't sure of the direction or outcome of this book. But most of all the Renaissance 9 year old Swede got on my nerves. I can believe that there are child prodigies out there that can recite and retain knowledge beyond their years, but emotionally they will still throw tantrums in the toy section when they don't get their way. This baby Moses was a terribly conceived character and then there was the wizard child that performed Jesus-like miracles and the whole thing went right down hill from there. I gave it an extra star for its originality and high concept, but that's as generous as I could be."
2,What's the big deal?,"I finished this book last night and was so utterly disappointed I wanted to scream. Perhaps Enger is a marvelous writer, perhaps his literary skills are maginficent, but the story really bites. I was so disturbed by the appearance of ""the villian"" (Jape) and the fact that he is still lurking around in society after shooting up this family and their home. And I could hardly believe that anyone could be excited for the love story that transpires at the end. I mean come on, what do we know about this girl and why should we like her? I spend a lot of time reading this book that should have been spent doing other things and it's all because of the hype surrounding the book. I thought for sure at the end the book would be redeemed and I would agree with the masses, but I guess I'm going to have to stop trusting popular opinion. Ughh."
5,Delicious,"I wanted to devour this book, but forced myself to read it slowly so it would last longer. The best book I've read all summer."
4,Not perfect but still worth a read,"I agree with many of the reviewers that some of the miracles are a little far-fetched, some of the writing can be a little questionable (a little too clever at times, incorrectly using words), and the younger sister is a little too advanced to be believable. However, I could forgive all of these and I got a lot of enjoyment out of the book. However, the thing that bothered me the most was the introduction of Waltzer around page 220. This whole part of the book just felt horribly wrong to me, and I would describe my feeling at the end of the book as one of slightly disappointment; I say disappointment because for the first 2/3 of the book I was thinking it would be one of my favorite reads in recent memory. Still, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it."
2,If I ruled the world......,"I don't know why I put myself through this type of torture in expecting people to do one thing, when I know that they're going to do the exact opposite. It is for this very reason that I don't buy either the DVD or VHS versions of television series' until long after the show has been canceled, (cries to herself). I would love to have this series in a more convenient format than VHS. Unfortunately however, buying it would be a total waste of money, considering they'll just come out with the full boxed set anyway, and then of course, charge up the yinyang for it. As with most things today, it's all about money. Those greedy producers do this to us purposefully to get more money, that's all there is to it. Themed episodes? BAH"
2,BEST OF ONLY,I think this show is fantastic - new cast every episode & plenty of surprise endings. Perfect for DVD. I loved this show when it was on tv. The show deserves 5 stars no doubt about - but it needs Season releases.On the website TVSHOWSONDVD there is a rumour that a boxset for Season 1 will be released in November 2005. I suggest if you only want the 1 box you buy this set for variety but you are like me (and obviously a few other fans who have made their point clear) you should wait at least til November to see if this rumour turns out to be true then you can buy the first set and build your collection from there - I would definately buy all the seasons if released.Like another viewer mentioned I had no idea this a remake until I saw the original version in a shop. The original version is available in 2 season sets so I am hoping this new version will follow.
1,Where is Stream of Consciousness?,"I have been trying to get this on DVD for 4 years. I did record it, but would like to have it without having to fast-forward through commercials, etc. I would like to know why some episodes have been released and others have not. What is the sense of this? I can see that I am not alone in my frustration here."
3,More themed discs coming out,"According to the MGM site, this will be a 6 discs set that includes the previously released Sex & SciFi and Time Travel discs, along with 4 new themed DVDs also available seperately:Aliens Among Us Collection""Quality of Mercy,"" ""Afterlife,"" ""The Grell,"" ""Relativity Theory,"" ""Alien Shop,"" ""Beyond the Veil""Fantastic Androids & Robots Collection""I, Robot,"" ""The Hunt,"" ""Resurrection,"" ""The Camp,"" ""Glitch,"" ""Small Friends""Mutation & Transformation Collection""The New Breed,"" ""Descent,"" ""The Joining,"" ""Double Helix,"" ""The Gun,"" ""The Inheritors""Death & Beyond Collection""The Second Soul,"" ""The Other Side,"" ""New Lease,"" ""Essence of Life,"" ""Human Trials,"" ""Black Box""I give it a 3 stars mostly because I glad they're releasing some, but not a big fan of this ""piecemeal"" thing. There's a huge number of great episodes they're skipping over entirely."
1,i wish i recorded these when i had chance,"MGM again shows their total lack of respect for the outer limits fans . as for me i will not buy this crap or any other MGM movies/shows until a true box set comes out . wish i recorded them all when i had chance. maybe its time we boycotted MGM sense money over fans seems to be the way they would have it. when they get poor FOX a outstanding example of how good things can be when u consider fans over profit, will buy them out and give us what we all want for some seven years now."
5,seaching for the facts,"I gave this 5 stars is that all the ""reviews"" complained about the method of release but no one really commented on the episode. I thought that is what reviews are for. I only saw a few episode so I would really appreciate if some who actually saw the episode shared something besides complaints. Be a completer not a complainer. So if someone actually has seen the shows write about them! Thanks."
1,"Love the series, hate this release","Like everyone else I can't imagine why the rights-owner of this series won't release full seasons or even a complete series collection. I guess they don't like money. I would incur my wife's wrath and buy it instantly. In the absence of such an offering, I opted to get this 6-disc set just to enjoy some of the episodes (it was under $14 so not too bad). Although I don't regret buying it, let it be known that these are flippers... another thing DVD collectors universally hate. Also, the compression quality I found to be VERY poor. On a widescreen 32"" Samsung and when played in either our dvd or bd player, I'm looking at mediocre (at best) VHS quality. At least a few of my favorites are in this set, so if MGM (or whoever now owns the rights) never decides to release any more of this series I'll have some of them."
1,Bad Formatting,"The formatting for this ebook doesn't work well with my Kindle 3. There are many lines of text that are just one or two words. There is no TOC formatting and the table of contents that is there is jarbled beyond my ability to read. The information in the regular text is there, but it is a chore to read instead of a pleasure. I would recommend getting a different Kindle version even if it costs a little more. The poor formatting is very irritating! :("
5,Great Middle School Book!,"S. R. Martin does a great job of writing quick, captivating mysteries that will grab your middle schooler's attention. Great for kids who are struggling readers and are overwhelmed at the thought of a thick chapter book. Also, great for read-a-loud."
4,rock and rap confidential tell us,"The band that made its mark with a chart-topping norteno arrangement of ""Aserje"" (""The Ketchup Song"") on its bubbly debut last fall. this (is their) darker follow up. Funky bass, guitar and accordion pushed by the group's female vocal duo, particularly Yessica Ruiz's whiplash rasp."
5,Wow!,If you're into RVs and Campers than this is definitely a good book to get - fun to read and look through -
1,Terrible!,"What a horible, horrible book! I teach graphic design and web site design and this book is absolutely terrible! I'll never use or recomend this book to anyone and I'm a design professional."
1,Limited View of Internet Design,"This book is a study in limitations for Web design and formatting. The Internet is cutting-edge & fluid, not a static medium. This book is for beginers only. If you're serious about becoming a web designer, do not limited yourself with such a rigid design code; realize that the web is a dynamanic element. Seek other books to further your web design work from real designers/art/design schools - not the Yale's Medical department."
1,Bad Design,"This book is laughable. As a design graduate with an actual degree, I can tell you that this book is NOT used as a reference to web design in any promient design school. Couple that with the fact that if you've been doing web design for a few years, like I have, you'll see that there is so much changes in both trends and design that you can't limit your pages to the outdated ideas that are portrayed in this book."
1,No style,"This book made too many promises that just didn't pan out. This book does not have any good examples of what decent web design should look like and how it should function.You can't create solid pages with all the ""don't do this"" and ""don't do that""s that are listed here. Serious web designers and graphic designers should avoid this book."
3,Nail clipper,"Quality was not as nice as I expected. Handle lock does not work well. The case for a pro tool should be good, but this one is not. It is not anywhere as nice as the one my podiatrist has. Of course, it isn't very expensive either. I would pay more for a class tool."
1,Too Difficult to Use,"So far I have been unable to use the Smoke/Fire Detector. I worked for quite a long time trying to insert the battery. Finally I had to give up. I am hoping that when my granddaughter who is in college gets home for Thanksgiving vacation, she will be able to figure out how to make the detector work!"
5,The best Challah Mixer Graet Power,This mixer is rated as the best Challah Mixer in the Market If you want to make a real Heavy religious Sabbath Challah this will be the best mixer for that.Ask around people who use it love it I make every Week a 9 Large Challas and all my neighbors and Family come to share itOh they they think I Should make the Challah for messiah!!! Hey listen to me this is the greatest Mixer
3,dissapointed,"I wanted to know more about setting up to shoot food photos. More about the strobes and less about cameras and fstops. If you have made it to the point that you are doing this type of photography, you already know about those things! Half of this book was wasted on stuff people of this level already understand"
2,Expected More - Disappointing,"I am a semi-pro photographer and was looking to expand my photography. Food photography from what I've heard is an advanced art. But this book covers too much basic photography and not enough on how to shoot food.The chapters on food and prop styling where good. The chapter on composition was also good with lots of examples from the bad shots to the keepers. The lighting chapter was a joke with no real advice on how to best light food. His description of lighting ratios was less than half a page and didn't explain how to setup the lights to achieve the ratios.His Photoshop retouching examples are very-very basic. The last chapter on ""Getting into the Business"" has very general and basic business advice.If you are new to photography and looking for your first photo book, this book could be helpful. Amateur and advanced enthusiast photographers should look elsewhere."
3,"Good, but...",The first 82 pages are un-necessary. The real 'meat and potatoes' of the book is the last two thirds. I learned form this part of the book.
4,Digital Food Photography,"As a food writer I frequently photograph food for publication. While only an amateur, I need to turn out good quality photos. This book is the first one I have found that addresses only digital food photography. It has been very helpful and encouraging for me with its information so specific to my needs. I use it as a reference each time I do a shoot."
5,The Best Cat Story in the World,"May Sarton, poet and journal-writer extraorindaire, wrote a novella/poem to the Cat, the Gentleman Cat, called ""The Fur Person"". I have reread this masterpiece every year for the past 25 years. ""The Fur Person"" is for children and adults, for everyone!"
4,THIS ALBUM IS BRAND NEW,"YO THE PROBLEM WITH THIS ALBUM IS THAT IT CAME AFTER THERE BEST EFFORT IN MOMENT OF TRUTH. IT IS STILL FIRE! THAT'S LIKE ANY ALBUM MICHAEL JACKSON DID AFTER THRILLER. YO THESE BEATS AND DUETS WITH FREDDIE FOX, FAT JOE, JADA KISS ARE THE TRUTH. GURU VOICE OVER PREMIER DANGEROUS BEATS ARE LETHAL. RIOT AKT, CAPTURE, SKILLS ETC ARE RIDICULOUS. GANGSTARR IF YOU HAPPEN TO READ THIS KEEP DOING WHAT YOUR DOING. YOU CATS HAVE BEEN ON IT FOR A WHILE AND GOT CRAZY LYRICS AND BEATS."
5,Just another classic!,"This album is mindblowin! The beats of Premo are still incredible and Guru is ahead of his time! This album got real bangers like""Who got gunz"" or ""Put Up or Shut Up""..and songs like ""In this life"" which really touches! I just wanna say it like Missy: ""Cop That Ish"""
1,Bluetooth may have a cavity?,"I'm still trying to get the Bluetooth connection working. I was trying it on a Mac Mini with no Internet connection. When the printer (which is really excellent) prints out text it also prints out extraneous characters when using Bluetooth.I am going to try it on another Mini with Internet access and see what happens. I really wonder why Canon's manual is just not detailed enough. Of course, it may be me...."
3,Coffee maker,"The product does all it claims to do, but falls down in the quality factor.Ive owned one for nine months ,using it once a week, and already the plastic pourer jug lid disintegrated and I can,t seem to find a replacement.For a lid that does two jobs, [Controls the stop and start feature] it certainly is not strong enough and should be thicker or made of a stronger substance. Jim Anderson"
5,The West Wing Season Seven,"It was in great shape for the price. In fact, it was new. It is one of the best seasons."
3,The Box,"This is the WORST BOX EVER.""At the center of the West Wing lie, of course, Kristen Chenoweth and Stockard Channing! The President's kind of on the side, and everyone else is just distracted."""
1,West Wing Season 7,"I bought season 5,6, and 7. All were OK but season 7. It contains disks 1-6 but this one had 1-4 and 2 number 5's. No disk 6."
5,The West Wing-The Complete Seventh Season,Once you have seen the seventh season of the West Wing you will want more! Excellent story lines and a cast that well acts their character to the fullest.
4,"not cured, but WAY BETTER!","I'm more than a little afraid to fly, but can't realistically avoid it, so I was in a pretty tough situation. Flying Without Fear really helped and I'm about a week away from my next trip (a long one from Seattle to Boston!) and though I still have some anxiety and can't say I'm looking forward to the flight -- I'm really handling it a lot better than I would have before I read this book. I was expecting a miracle cure, I guess -- certainly an unrealistic expectation -- and didn't quite get it, but this book has helped me. What it helped me do that was most useful was identify WHY I'm afriad to fly (Okay, turns out I;m a bit of a control freak) but I was disappointed that it didn't tell me how to solve that problem. Still, having identified that, and just not feeling like a big baby, this book has done its job!"
5,Authentic Information in an Easy-to-Read Story,This book is a quick page-turner but rich in information about the Holy Land. The reader can participate in the re-discovery of significant events in Christian and Jewish history. This is another Michener classic.
5,"Insight into sameness of Judaism, Christianity and Islam",Mitchener's trick of interweaving short stories from eras of history and prehistory with a contemporary story kept the pace snappy while educating the reader in the contextual settings that formed three of the big religions of our time. One was left wondering what the real differences are between each set of faiths.
5,The Source - good course on world religions,"Michener's The Source has helped me learn about the evolution of religions and as a close parallel, how human thought has changed over the centuries. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of Christianity and/or Judaism and/or religion in general. This is one of the top ten books that I feel has truly educated me into the knowledgeable and tolerant person I am today."
4,at a dig in Israel,"""The Source"" goes slightly off Michener's usual track, because the history of Israel is revealed during the digging at the archeological site (fictional city ruins), where various items corresponding to different times in history are found, and the story is based upon them.The scheme, nevertheless, is similar to other novels by this author, the chapters based on important events from the point of view of one, usually fictional, individual. The characters in the further chapters are often descendants of the more ancient ones and references are made to the past.As usual, for people who want to get some knowledge about the area in the novel form, this is an excellent book. I have enjoyed this novel very much, and for anybody, who likes this author, it will not be disappointing."
5,Probably the least known of Michener's works and his best.,"The best of Michener's books. The insight into humans, humanity, inhumanity and religion is unequalled. A must for students in the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences"
5,One of my all time Favorites!!,"I first read this book in the 70's when religion was not always in the forefront of the news and in politics. So I wanted to read it again with many more years of knowledge under my belt. Well, I loved it then and I love it now! I loved every one of James Michener's books, and I read them all, but this one taught me so many things. Even though it is a novel, Michener always tied the details to accurate history. I learned so much about the beginnings of Christianity, and especially gained knowledge about Judaism. The characters were so alive, my only complaint was that I would get so involved with one set of characters, then the book would move on to the next time period. Very timely in this day and age. Not much has changed. A MUST read."
5,THE SOURCE,Enjoyed this book immensely. Although it is a novel I found it very informative regarding Jewish heritage. James Michener's book's are always a wonderful read.
1,A Windy Disappointment,"A very long book, that's really a medium-sized book that's been relentlessly padded to outlandish lengths. Despite his massive success, Michener's writing also suffers from an unpleasant clunkishness -- his prose is anything but elegant. Frankly, halfway through, I threw the book into the ocean."
1,Disappointing,"It never arrived. I ordered it, paid for it to be sent to my cousin in the U.S.A., and although amny other books before it had successfully arrived there, I was told that it was an incorrect address and as such my order had been cancelled. Thoroughly disappointing."
4,The soul of jazz guitar...,"This is a must read for all Grant Green fans, or anyone who wants a glimpse of what the 60's and 70's jazz scene was really like... How he got started in St. Louis, the years in New York at Blue Note, the good times in Detroit in the 70's, and that last fateful trip to the Lighthouse in the green Caddy... Grant was truly the heart and soul of jazz guitar and everybody, including Wes and George Benson knew it... Written by Grant Green Jr's ex-wife there are lots of personal stories from the folks who knew Grant best! Lots of the great Blue Note Album cover photos by Frank Wolfe too!"
5,Can't live without it!,"I have used the Gregg for more than twenty years. I thought I knew all I needed to know about grammar, punctuation, and word usage...until I read this book and realized how much I DIDN'T know! The most important thing about this book is to read the introductory pages that describe HOW to use the book. If you don't, you may get easily frustrated. More often than not, I use this book to help explain something I know to be true--but can't explain why (e.g. use of fewer vs less, use of further vs farther).I used this book in an administrative support workshop I taught and found that having participants use the worksheets (purchased separately), really reinforced how to use the book most efficiently. For personal use, they aren't necessary (just helpful). You will not regret this purchase."
3,cheesy but cute,"This book is neither deeply philosophical nor realistic, but that's okay because it is written well enough to qualify for a quick cheesy fix. With both previous points in mind I doubt that anyone will remember this book after a couple of months.If the book had spent more time with Carter and Angie and spent less time trying to keep them apart I would've enjoyed it more. After all, they were an appealing couple, even though they only had what seemed to be a few pages of actual contact. Another flaw with the book is that it oversimplifies the different groups of people. Sk8ers and Preppies? Come on. Then there's also the rich against the workers of the mill. Nothing is as clear cut as that, not even in Torren.That aside, it's cute, it's well paced, and it's cheap. So if you're looking for you're next fix of cheesy teen lit than this is a perfect choice. You'll gobble it up before you know it."
3,Well...,"Before I got a Kindle, I owned this book via paperback. I first read it in my teens so naturally it was right up my alley of secrets and forbidden romances I favored so much. So when I purchased my Kindle, I knew this had to be on here. However the typos were so distracting, it took away from the story. I was really disappointed with who ever typed this for Kindle; one of my favorite books was butchered because someone couldn't watch what keys they were typing. Overall, if you are a hopeless romantic and a sucker for a scandal like I am, then this is the book for you. Just buy the paperback to really enjoy it."
4,Good Vacuum; Great Bargain,"No, these do not come with the accessories, but they are good vacuums. I purchased a Eureka 5856 a year ago, which is virtually identical to these 5860's, except for the color (yellow instead of maroon). It is the best vacuum I have ever had. It is really good at picking up pet hair. After a year of use it performs like it was brand new.These refurbished vacuums show signs that they have been used - on the wheels, and scratchs here and there, but they are cleaned up, the filters are new, the brush is spotless. You really can't go wrong, since they come with a one year warranty. Replacement filters for these vacuums are almost half the cost of this refurbished 5680.You have to put the handle on, which is easily done by two phillips screws.The vacuum comes with extension devices for getting into hard to reach places, and a replacement belt."
4,Outstanding singer,There's no doubt Trace has an outstanding voice. If you are new to country music I definetly recommend this album. !
4,Just Beautiful,"These crayons are basically a lipstick for kids that one draws with. Colors are gorgeous and the art work, however scribbly-stunning! Any child can become an instant abstract artist. There are two drawbacks to this product. One, they do not last long and it is on the pricey side because of that. Also if it gets on your clothes, you have to wash it right away. But one look at all the drawings my 22 months old has created and they are priceless!"
4,The book served as a good brief summary.,"I was looking for a book that would give me a simple, brief review of the events leading to, during, and after 3 Mile Island and thats exactly what it did. Much of the text read as a journal of the author's actions as a reporter covering the event, but it still was interesting reading since I knew nothing about the sequence of events of the disaster and this was well described by the author."
5,Teach us to Pray!,"(...)Thank God for books like ""The Power of a Praying Parent"", which offers encouragement and practical support for parents who want a deeper, richer spiritual life in the home. For another book on prayer and parenting, look into THE FAMILY CLOISTER: BENEDICTINE WISDOM FOR THE HOME (Crossroad, May, 2000) and THE CHRISTIAN FAMILY TOOLBOX: 52 BENEDICTINE ACTIVITIES FOR THE HOME (Crossroad, Sept. 2001), both by David Robinson. (...)"
3,Great idea done slowly and boring,"I really like the idea of having a story about Elaysian Melora Pazlar's homeworld, Gemworld. Being a big Barclay fan, I was glad see him again, especially a main character. I was very intrigued by the many sentient species on Gemworld, and how they all live with each other. However, the plot, even tough somewhat interesting, was very slow moving, which discourage me a bit. I've already move to the next book and I hope it is more fast moving than this one was."
2,Remarkable light on the substance; disappointing purchase,"I read a number of the reviews here and was quite excited to read this book when it came in the mail. Much to my chagrin, the material was very light and pretty much common sense. There were no great insights and a remarkable lack of specific examples. The author discusses her suggestions in generalities, but does not support those suggestions with specific examples forcing the reader to long for clarification on exactly what she is trying to recommend. All in all, a disappointing purchase. This book may have been great in 2000, but today is obsolete."
1,Yuck!,"I couldn't even finish this book and I have most of the Krentz books. The heroine was a wimpy fool and the hero wasn't any sort of a hero. He was just abusive. Sheesh!I ran into this same problem with the re-issues of Krentz under the Stephanie James name. Foolishly, I bough the first 6 because of Krentz's reputation. Won't be buying any more of those old issues!But it's nice to see how well she's risen above those earlier books, isn't it?"
1,Awful!,"I would bet that JAK would love to have this book disappear. Unfortunately, that means it will probably be republished along with some of her better efforts. Somehow, our mistakes are always with us. Didn't Shakespeare say something similar?The entire plot of this book is one of an abusive relationship. It consists of a basicially insecure Neanderthal man and a submissive female.The book came as a shock to me after being fond of JFKs other books. The only thing this book deserves is being thrown in the trash. Probably to the great relief of it's author."
2,Would be a great tool...,"Would be a great tool...if there weren't so many overlooked problems at the factory.Cons:1) One battery was dead and had to be replaced2) Charger didn't work and had to be replaced3) Isn't compatible with newest 18v ""M"" linePros:1) In Milwaukee's defense they did replace all defective products (which is what was supposed to be done in the first place.)2) This tool has ample power and performs amazingly.Recommendation:Buy it new. I'll never buy a refurbished tool again."
4,Great Book for anyone,"Illusions by Richard Bach was a Great book! It talked of many daily problem solving topics. It had some good quotes in it, even one of my friends who just picked it up to look at it and looked inside read some of the quotes and she said that there were some that really touched her."
5,an inspirational way to look at life,"Long a personal favorite of mine, Illusions presents a different way of looking at life and our place in it. I do not, for the most part, take it literally; rather, I believe it to be a metaphor for going beyond yourself and your preconceived notions. Richard Bach reminds us that there is much more to life than anything we can imagine.The one part I do take literally is the example set by the blue feather. Keep a question in your mind and an eye open for the answer, and eventually you will find it--though there is no guarantee it will be any time soon.Every time I open this book, I learn something new about myself. You will, too."
5,A great fable,"A friend got me to read this in college and I've re-read it many times over the years since, passing it on to other friends that have enjoyed it!It has a wonderful magic about it and while I still have to clean my windshield I like to think that maybe there are fewer bugs these days."
5,novella,Everyone should read this book at one point of there lives. Illusions is a book for the soul and I love the Messiah's handbook. This help me full my blank pages of my elusive reality. I would advise many lost souls to read this novella.
3,The Illusion of Illusions,"Illusions is a good book that questions the way we as human beings think. Throughout the novel we are informed that this world is an illusion, we are living different lifetimes in our every action, much like movies. We are told we can walk on water or sink in earth if we believe we can. We are capable of being happy or unhappy, we control our every whim. However, is this true? Perhaps not, the reader is informed in the closing line that perhaps none of what they have been led to believe is true. Is this just another illusion which allows one to make their own decisions as to if they are happy or unhappy? Maybe thsi gives those who cannot handle this new found truth an escape that all they have learned is false."
5,simply magic,This book came to my hands when I was going through a hard time. It was magic. Best one ever. From all I have ever read.It is up to you.
5,"PICK UP THE HANDBOOK, AND BECOME THE MESSIAH","We could all be gods, unwilling or willing. And we could all have followers that we do not want. A new twist on an ancient idea, and an ancient being.....I think you'll like it."
5,Thank you!,"How can I thank you, Richard Bach, for writting down what happened in Illinois that summer? It's so wonderful, so perfect, just THANK YOU! Shimoda explained the things I-and I guess many others-had deep in our minds and weren't daring enough to put in words. He feels like as a closest friend, but the best fraze in the book is the one right before the epilogue. Thank you, Richard Bach! Thank You!"
3,"If you like spiritual fiction, it's good","I'm not a big fan of fiction, so biased to start. However, it is a quick read and does provoke some thinking about what it means to be enlightened, or in this case, ""the reluctant Messiah."" If you are strongly set against considering alternate theories regarding what is ""real,"" this may not be the book for you, but if you are spiritually open and enjoy fiction, it's a definite good and quick read."
5,No other book . . . no other auther,". . . Could make life seem so wonderfully great and yet simplistic. When life gets tough, I often pull out my well worn copy of this book. I've loaned it out many times and bought copies for friends. It will continually stay on my keeper shelf. My favorite quotes on life come from this book because Bach makes us realize we write our own futures through each decision we make and yet everything in life we can learn from and have the power to change."
5,Men Discussing God and Having Fun too.,"Illusions by Richard Bach is the kind if book that your either getting nothing out of, or walk away from changed. I first read Illusions during High School, and NO book effected my way of thinking about life and my relationship with God. To read the story of two guys barnstorming around the wheat fields of the Midwest, and their adventures along to way is enough alone to make it enjoyable. To scartch beneath this book and to go back to the story again and again after years or months, makes it a magic book. I return to it's pages time after time in order to restore my relationship with God and the magic of life that this book reminds of that exists, If you enjoy this book I would also recommend an earlier book that had an equal effect (Nothing by Chance"
2,Why?,"I really don't understand the overwhelming popularity of this book. I mean, what did people actually learn from it? How did it benefit their lives? I think you need to be extremely open-minded to enjoy this book. I thought it was too vague and manipulative - any thinking person can find fault with many of the principles included. Unlike some reviewers, I'm not going to burn it, but neither can I say that it's ""A Great Way of Looking at life"" as my copy proclaimed."
4,Ilusions,"I think that this book is really great. The idea of the Reminder of the Advance Soul is really good. There is good quote that had helped me to find the direction to my problem. This book had given me another way of looking at life and challenge my old view. I am sure that if this book hasn't help anyone with problem, then they must have enjoy it like I did."
4,a 1st step on a great journey,"For all those beginning this quest, this book is a great place to start. It summarizes well all the salient points in a succinct little package. If you're still feeling adventurous after this book, I recommend The Education Of Oversoul Seven by Jane Roberts."
4,"Great book, lotsa words to live by - nondenominational",Universally appealing. Bypasses the usual dogma and gets in to the true spirit of what religion should mean to everyone. Follow the spirit not the word.
2,poor cover,The book was very old and the cover was very tatty. It was ripped and pieces were missing. It felt like it was someone's favourite book and had been carried around with them for fifty years.
3,New Age Redux,"Clearly Richard Bach is a cult figure for certain New Age fans who tend to look for easy answers to why we're all here on Planet Earth (assuming there is an answer. I tend to be agnostic about these matters). He's not a particularly skilled writer, but there is a certain appeal to his basic persona: barn-storming pilot/lightweight philosopher seeks the Meaning of Life. This is actually the third Bach book I've read (have also read ""JLS"" and ""One"") and methinks the last. I read the book, like all his books, in an hour or two, there was a certain charm in the execution, the Bach character is appealing, but it's all way too simplistic and pat, as New Age stuff tends to be. Not a terrible book, but not one that will stick with me either."
1,poo,"give me a break. oooooh....squirt, splat. spiritual poo. inspirational...blah, blah, blah, and gab, gab. disIllusions. Come and find me. I'll poo you. The best self-improvement: to get over self-improvement."
4,LOOKING AT LIFE,"a good book about looking at life. got some more of his work, gonna read it...after the shadow line."
5,How Illusions by Richard Bach changed my life.,"My friend suggested this book to me. I read it, and found that it described a great way to look at life. It presented it in an open-minded point of view which set it aside from other books I have read. It has definately given me inspiration, and I have read it quite a few times. I cannot wait to read it again.I have selected a favorate quote from the book.""Don't be dismayed at goodbyes. A farewell is necessary before you can meet again."""
5,great movie,i get tierd of those cheesy love stories. i loved this one though. it made you think of love diffrently and took a step outside the box. the two leading ladies did this movie justice. i would definately watch anything they are starring in and have since purchase two other movies they where in.
4,No more need for a Bra,This cami is absolutely wonderful. It gives support and even my friends who have substantial breasts find that they no longer need to wear a bra. I just wish that they made a summer version as it is not comfortable in high temperatures.
2,Flexees Body Cami,"After all the hype on tv shows about this cami and other products that help prevent the fat from hanging out too far, I am very DISAPPOINTED. I purchased the L and can only guess that I have too much to control! It also does not offer much support and in the heat, it's too much to wear between a bra and a blouse ."
5,Love the sound,"Sound Bright and have lasted a little over a month of solid playing, Arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery date and they couldnt be in better condition for the proce, being the nearest music store is over 30 mins away"
4,4 1/2 stars Above Average Death Metal,"First of all, I had heard about Divine Empire before but I never really considered buying one of their CDs until I saw them live. Divine Empire was absolutely amazing live and I just had to buy their CD after seeing them alive. They are just as good in the studio as they are live. The music is ferocious, the vocalist delivers absolutely sick vocals and the music is brutal and heavy all the way throughout, with a few heavy breakdowns thrown in for good measure. If you like bands like Dying Fetus, Skinless, or pretty much any straightforward American Death Metal band, than by all means check Divine Empire out, you will not be disappointed."
4,refreshing,"certainly an odd movie - it had a very surrealist feel throughout, I could never quite tell if it was an old, clich? mystery, a comedy, or an art film. it had strong philosophical undertones, and all and all I think was very well done. it was beautiful, without taking itself too seriously."
5,My Favorite Movie,"Shadows and Fog is my favorite movie of all time!!! It works on a lot of different levels. The script is intelligent and humorous, the production is brilliant, and the acting is fantastic. The end is profound. I watch Shadows and Fog over and over and see new brilliancies each time. I wouldn't be surprised if 50 years from now, people consider this Woody's best movie."
5,We need more books like this.,"This book was eye opening to me. Because the author limits his scope to 100 drugs, he was able teach me the philosophy and some history behind the creation of the most useful drugs of today. As an experienced physician, the author is able to insert is own opinions and experiences about his chosen top 100 drugs. This makes this book much more useful to the average person then those other ""pill books"" which cram thousands of drugs and mind boggling technical info into a single book. If you have found yourself caught up in, and maybe discouraged by, the ""natural supplements"" craze (like I have), then you may find this book will bring you back into the 20th centry of safe FDA approved drugs."
3,My Experience,I borrowed this book from my local library; I was simply unable to follow the arguments due to my lack of the necessary Latin knowledge (also mentioned by another reviewer). As I am very interested in Anselm's philosophical argument for the existence of God and the response of philosophers and theologians to Anselm's work I was disappointed that I just couldn't figure it out. Perhaps with a Latin Dictionary or an annotated version of Barth's work I could decipher it as I too think it could be worth the effort. I have high school French but no Latin and I am a beginner at philosophy so perhaps others will be more successful if they are willing to work at it.
5,DOES THE JOB.,This seed catcher was exactly what I needed to keep the bird seed from falling onto the ground. I can't say every drop of seed the birds scattered went into the tray but most of it did.My husband had to drill a hole in the bottom so it could be attached to the feeder that I have but it could be done.
1,Towels?,"Towels are supposed to be absorbent, these swoosh the water across your body...Not good towels, pretty, yes- just for ""show"" though."
1,The Groove Squad review,"This is actually worse then the Battletoads ploit from 1992. Would you belive they actually got Jennifer Love Hewitt to star in this film. At least when Battletoads was ripping of TMNT,it was still popular at the time but The Groove Squad was ripping Power Rangers in 2002 when Power Rangers was long gone and no long popular. The cast is bland and forgettable. The villains are obvious and phoned in a mile away. The battles are chessy & corny at best. The Animation is so-so at best. The story is tired and done to death. The only reason I will watch it because the 3 main girls are hot but even then I will still hate in the long run. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
4,Nice,"I haven`t worn them yet, but the product is good. They look just like on the picture. And I just like it."
1,Returned it!,"Very unhappy with the seemingly poor quality, unnecessary complicated voice mail setup, volume control, etc., etc. Returned it and bought a Panasonic -- a mfr with whom I've been very satisfied in the past -- instead. So far I'm very happy with the Panasonic."
5,A Treasure of Practical Help,"What a terrific surprise to get ""Order from Chaos"". I read it in one day because I couldn't put it down. What an important book! A treasure of practical help.It's just what I needed, especially now. I've already organized my office, garage and storage shed, and gave away and threw out lots of ""stuff"". I feel more in control and less burdened already. And I love my pending file.I know I'll keep referring and rereading Liz's book to help me learn to prioritize continually--my biggest weakness."
5,Tony Banks' A Curious Feeling hasn't lost anything over time,"I bought the LP a long time ago and wore deeper grooves in it for all the times I played it. The atmosphere created by Tony Bank's composition style, weaving keyboards/synths, and intelligent lyrics always takes me to another place. I don't get to play my LPs much anymore and picked up the CD version. Once I played it, the wonderful feelings all came back and I appreciated the creativity and musicianship even more now. I strongly recommend this album for anyone with a hunger for something different and inspiring."
5,20 years later...and still my favorite album.,"As others have noted, Tony Banks was the musical brains behind Genesis. So of course Genesis sounds like Banks and vice versa. A Curious Feeling is at least on a par with A Trick Of The Tail or Duke...beautiful and at times, thrilling.As for the vocals, they're harmless. At least they're not in the current ""operatic"" style of Dream Theater or Rush (or Styx!). Nor will you have to put up with the brougue of that character from Marillion.A nice companion to A Curious Feeling is Mike Rutherford's Smallcreep's Day which was written by the other hidden talent in Genesis, Anthony Phillips. They really don't make records like these anymore--and why should they? Phil Collins records a song with 3 chords and a drum machine and sells millions."
4,Good-Looking Paper Towel Holder,"This is a nice looking paper towel holder, a good height/size, and it has good heft. The one drawback is that the top and bottom half don't fit perfectly together, but this doesn't affect its usefulness and is hidden within the paper towel tube."
1,item non functional on opening,"package arrived intact and undamaged. All components also intact,including battery. After carefully inserting battery, and following all directions, unit simply didn't function. It turned on, but none of the buttons worked in a manner consistent with the instructions, and the laser didn't work at all. I'm sending it back."
3,not great but not bad either,i bought this seven years ago . but a reviewer opened my eyes my some of the mistakes in the book . mostly weak on books by winston churchill . couple of errors to . furthermore the book was pretty expensive . but it covers a lot of material. and i spended many hours reading it .
4,Pleasant,"This is a nice humidifier, cute, space saving and quiet. It looks a lot better in real life compared to the picture."
5,Box in a Box,"I ordered the Rubbermaid SF21 Deck Box from Amazon on a Friday. It qualified for free shipping. It arrived the following Monday, just three days after my order. The box snapped together easily as soon as I followed the instructions. Because of double wall construction Rubbermaid storage products are sturdy when assembled. This is the fourth Rubbermaid storage product we have purchased over the past 20 years. They have all survived cold Iowa winters and hot summers. When we need to add another outdoor storage product we'll go Rubbermaid again."
5,Excellent box!,"Perfect box...great size and looks nice. Using it to store pool items like hoses, vacuum, etc. Looks very nice in my backyard and really seems to hold a lot! Would definitely buy again!"
1,OMG what a piece of junk,"I purchased a Lifetime 60012 storage box prior to this and was very surprised with its high quality and durability. I wanted something smaller, so I chose this. I have to tell you, it is shockingly cheap quality. Absolutely no comparison to the Lifetime box. I would not recommend you waste your money on this. I figure if it lasts two years, I'll be lucky. If you can get it for under $40, then I'd say you probably will get your money's worth."
1,What a Piece of Junk,"Sturdy, you can't be serious. Waterproof, you can't be serious. I'd like to meet the engineer who designed this piece of junk. The box won't even stay together. Rubbermaid should send a roll of duck tape with this to hold it together. Please don't waste you time or money on this. Both Amazon and Rubbermaid should be ashamed for selling this to consumers. The funny part is the box shows a women sitting on it. The next picture should show the box falling apart and the woman falling to the ground."
3,Slightly damaged in shipping,"This is a nice heavy duty notebook. The rings are very easy to pull apart, and don't offer too much resistance. The only problem is that my notebook was damaged by the rings during shipping. They tore the front plastic pockets on the inside front cover of the notebook (see the picture I posted). Something must have been pushing hard on the front cover during shipping that made the rings dig in.It still does the job though, and since I don't need to use the front pockets, it's not too bad."
1,Does not work,"Title claims it is a non-stick binder, but after cramming it with women, I found that many of the women did in fact stick to the binder and were not able to get out in time to go home and cook dinner. I'll be looking elsewhere."
3,AK-47 Bonus for Single Moms/Single Parents,"It's clear that Avery is trying to broaden its customer base. Single moms who purchase this binder will receive a coupon for a 20% discount off all AK-47's purchased through November 6, 2012. In addition, background checks will be waived for all members of single-parent homes who present the coupon. I would have given it 5 stars but I don't personally qualify for the bonus (I'm single, but no kids). But, gosh, I thought it would be a great idea to at least tell you about it."
5,Great Binder,"These are probably my favorite binders. Avery has always proven to have quality binders, and we use a lot of them at our home. I like many of the features about it.* Heavy Duty - for a 2"" notebook, I really like the heavy duty binders. They need to hold up to use.* Clear View for adding your own cover,* D ring for holding more paper, we tend to fill notebooks up here :-)* the wide width, so dividers don't stick out and get all messed up,* non-stick plastic, so your ink doesn't glue your pages to the notebook,* the 4 inner pockets are handy,* the hole and peg fastener of the ring - is probably my fave feature, regular binders (with the jagged edge rings) don't hold up well under use.* And extra nice is the 1 touch open - truly helpful."
5,"Great Product, Big Improvements!","I am an artist who has to show my works in portfolio form from time to time. So I've gone through quite a few of these binders over the years. As well, I've added quite a few pages to my portfolio, so this binder arrived just in time.The one touch EZD ring is really cool, very easy to operate. And inside there are extra pockets! This is a huge thing for those of use who have contracts or other loose sheets that need to be handed out. There's even some small pockets in the spine, great for business cards.I know I'm going to really like the larger size and the ease of use. The pockets were a nice bonus that I didn't realize would be there. Thanks Avery, you have really improved an already useful product!"
4,Very sturdy and efficient,"This binder is sturdy, and has a large ring that holds a lot without being bulky.No matter how secure the rings are supposed to be in a notebook, after time, they seem to become misaligned. This binder seems quite sturdy, even with a lot of papers in it. It only has a lever on one end, which I think will prevent it from getting out of alignment.The front has a clear pocket, so you can personalize it if you wish.The front and back cover have several pockets."
3,Lasted about 6 months,"After using it for about 6 months (light use, not opening and closing it all the time) the middle rings became misaligned and would not close all the way. Any time you turned a page, the middle hole would come out of the binder."
4,Good Binder.,"This is a nice large-sized binder. The D-rings work exceptionally well and make the page lay nice. The rings are very easy to open but not accidentally. They close nice and tight. Inside the binder has three pockets on each side. I don't feel like the binder itself is overly strong, but for most uses I think it will hold up just fine. I don't love that you can slip paper into all three sides...I feel like it is too easy to end up stretching or ripping it. However, I can see how this could come in handy."
5,Good Binder for Heavy Loads.,"This binder is sturdy and well designed. Inside both covers are three document sleeves. The ""D"" shape of the rings allows more sheets while making paging through easier. There is only one opening lever for the rings, but it is much larger than usual, padded and works much better than the others I have tried. The outside cover has the customary transparent sleeves for inserting custom cover art or information. This is a good binder. It is well worth the money."
2,Don't be fooled by the cover!,"I only saw one naked guy in this film, not plural, not ""men."" This is about an older, married writer falling for a younger guy. This plot has often been done before, but in recent light of famous men getting caught doing risqu'e things, it may be timely. It could be my busted, hooptie of a TV, but any time the English subtitles were more than 2 lines long, I couldn't see the last line. Still, you can guess what they were saying from context. I love the way that there's a burgeoning body of films about gays in Eastern Europe. A film major could probably write a great paper comparing and contrasting them. Some may think this film was all flesh with no plot. It's really the opposite: a plot and scant amounts of flesh. This is not Kristen Bjorn: it's your typical, foreign, indie movie."
4,Another excellent British band,"Valentyne Suite: To me, Colosseum showed Chicago how it's done. Jon Hiseman, Dick Heckstall-Smith and Tony Reeves formerly with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.."
1,Not for the serious gilder,"Projects presented are not traditional -- distressed this, distressed that -- if you're looking to learn serious craftsmanship in gilding, this is NOT the book."
3,Poorly packed for shipping,"The box arrived in a partially crushed state with both ends broken open. (Shipped from PSI) Incredibly, everything was still there. When I tightened the setscrews on the joiners for the two long aluminum guide halves, it made visible bumps in the opposite side of the aluminum--disconcerting but hopefully not a problem. The instructions state (and I confirmed) that there may be edge-burrs in the aluminum where it joins, and to sand or scrape them smooth. Why couldn't the manufacturer have done this already? I haven't tried the thing out yet, but I am hoping for the best."
2,i don't own this but....,"before buying this..if you are serious...and you can afford it... look into festool's version of this concept. light years better, one of the best purchases our shop ever made. especially good for site work when you need precise cuts but didn't bring the table saw. i shunned such 'snooty' tools for years but now i'm convinced that most of what festool makes is the best in it's class."
4,From Domination to Partnership,Ms. Anderson has added a scholarly and authentic voice to the research on the origins of male domination. I highly recommend this book for anyone who would like to know more about the damage done by Christian missionaries to peaceful egalitarian societies. I explore the same subject on my website...Werner Krieglstein Professor of Philsophy
4,"Plagiarism, murder and authors....","Plot It Yourself is a interesting peek into the publishing business, which Rex Stout understood, with the added spice of blackmail, murder and Nero Wolfe finding himself having problems getting a clue. Archie Goodwin has to push and shove and poke to get the great detective's mind working on this case. Plot It Yourself and Death Of A Doxy are the first books I read by Rex Stout so I have good memories of the books. This is more of a Archie Goodwin book as he seems to do much of the work, as always, and also seems to be the most upset by the killer always being a step ahead of them. As always there are tons of clues as to who the killer is but they are so buried in the rest of the story that it is truly a mystery to the reader, even after reading it more than once over the many years."
5,Lily of the Valley Spray,This was a gift for my wife. She was thrilled to recieve this fragrance. I was pleased at the way it was packaged and delivered. This was a spray she had when she was young and could never find. Thank you for supplying it and I am sure I will order more in the future for her. She would like to see if it is sold as a roll-on stick to carry in her purse. Thank you again.
1,Disappointing,"This doesn't smell anything like lily of the valley. It's very spicey -- similar to a man's aftershave. I checked the box and the bottle because I thought they may have sent me the wrong product.I was trying to find a lily of the valley scent that wasn't as pricey as Evelyn & Crabtree's, but I'll be going back to them because their EDT spray smells wonderful and the scent lasts a long time."
2,Not comfortable,I found these gloves to be itchy and confining. The wrist was way too tight. My wrist is small. I wonder how anyone with a larger wrist could fit into this.
2,>_>,"I still use these despite the fact that they're a bit too short in the wrist and the stretch out in the wrist area like it's nobody's business. Glad they were cheap, but I won't repurchase."
3,It's Okay,"According to the directions (not stated on-line) you have to treat the teak with 3 coats of the oil, and they recommend you put the stool out inthe sun to dry. I have not had the time to do that. I gave it one coat and let it dry. It went back to the same color as before I started.Maybe one 3 day weekend when I have the time to devote to it, I will do as the instructions said."
2,Adulterated teak oil,"Did I miss something in the product specs? Nope, there weren't any. I thought I was buying teak oil, not finish. This may be good protection for outdoor furniture but is too sticky for indoor furniture. Has a strong smell from the additives."
3,Not for the developer,"If you are a developer looking for examples and tutorials covering the BizTalk tools (Editor, Mapper, and Application Designer), don't buy this book. There is very little information about how to use these. The concepts of e-commerce and workflow strategies are discussed in detail. The title is misleading because it really does not explain how to ""implement"" the BizTalk server. I guess I am just spoiled from reading WROX books."
5,Built like a hammer. Better than some hammers actually.,"I have one of these, as well as several other microphones. The SM58 is a good all around mic - the reason it's an industry standard/go-to, but the Beta 58A is a better (in my opinion) vocal-specific mic...basically giving (again, in my opinion) a higher quality sound. The SM58 by comparison sounds muffled/muddy, where the Beta58A is clearer, stronger, and more articulate. If you're used to the SM58, then the Beta58A can sound thin and harsh, but, that is adjustable at the board - end result is that it's a tighter sounding mic with more clarity.Pattern-wise, it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds - I play drums and use this mic for that reason, is that it picks up less of my drums than a SM57 or a SM58."
1,hahahaha,"This book is out of print? Why am I not at all surprised? And you can own a copy for the price of 1 cent? Hahahahaha, That's bad. I made the mistake of reading this book years ago, and I felt a little less intelligent for doing so. It is nothing but the same marshmellow fluff Rush has been preaching for years."
1,Rush Addiction,"Rush Limbaugh addicted to drugs!? I thought he was addicted to FOOD! He sure had me fooled!Seriously, The Way Things Ought to Be is that hypocrites like Rush get the hell off the airwaves and out of the bookstores so people like me won't have to waste our money.This book reeks of fat pomposity and reading it again (after the news about his addiction) it really does sound like a goofball ego-maniac who is fueled entirely by drugs.Don't waste your time on this one. If you already have a copy, you can put it through your shredder and use the waste material for packing items you send through the mail at Christmas time.Good luck."
1,Tripe,"Sorry, that's all I can say about it. Read Al Franken's _Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot_ Or check out Fairness and Accurace In Reporting (FAIR) at the obvious URL. It debunks many of Limbaugh's claims."
1,Goodness!,"A hard hitting fantasy book in the grand style! Now Limbaugh can join the ranks of other greats in Fantasy Literature. Like Tolkien and Lovecraft, Rush has dreamed up a dark little frightening world, excect in Rush's land, the Lefties are evil and the Righties can do no wrong, and the Middlies must convert to Rightism or face the wrath of God! Spooky stuff!I had ordered this book, but had to cancel my order once I found out that he was a drug addict (an OxyCotin Fiend) and should be imprisoned. Instead I had no choice but to read a library edition, since I did not want to support his illegal habit."
1,Worthless,When are people going to stop listening to this idiot and come to their own conclusion about the way things are or ought to be?
4,Zareba 07106-96 Premium Lightning Diverter,"I personally like Zareba products for there price and quality. However, I am rating this 07106-96 only 4 stars vs 5 because after I installed same, I noticed after a heavy fog &/or light rain that my electric fence was shorting out! After some trouble-shooting I found it was this product that was the cause! A simple fix is to add some 100% silicone to the top-of-the clear plastic dome where you attach your ground wire because it dose leak just enough mositure for the clear plastic tube to become coated with some-sort of ""algae"" growth that will short your fence out -- as I live in the Pacific Northwest/damp at times. Since I added the silicone I have had no problems with this product and have not had any lightning and I would recommend this product for cheap insurance against possible lighting strikes close to your electric fence."
2,A waste of time,Having watched The Outpost with Ray Stephenson I figured this movie would be on the same order. I was in error. One character is so bad that he tries to commit rape. The other tries to stop it and is beaten into unconsciousness. David Warner is probably the only saving grace of this film. The airborne soldier who deserts is shown as sympathetic. He accidentally kills a woman and child during combat. the rest of the story makes no sense. IMHO the movie is made to depict American soldiers as less than honorable.
5,sensational overview of american pop music history,"Feinstein is one of the most knowledgeable historians of pop music, and these 3 CDs are full of ACCURATE information (not what you will usually encounter in surveys which claim to be histories). Yes, they are also about his life both personal and professional, so if you don't want to know what it's like to be a obsessive collector and historian like Michael, then you may not like these CDs. His views are well expressed and supported by some excellent, rare footage of performers from the 1920's through the 1940's. By the way, he is also a remarkably gifted pianist and singer, but the CDs are not predominantly about his performing. Even those who are not lovers of his performing will find much to enjoy here! Finally, these are the most beautifully produced DVDs I have ever seen!"
2,A bit disappointing,"The content of this book was truly engaging, but the author's disjointed manner of writing and her constant display of self-importance put me off."
5,A Pioneering Album of the Early Ambient/New Age Era.,"In 1980, I made the pilgramage to Philly by bus to the coolest import record store in town to buy this pioneering electronic record. Rainbow Dome Musick had been playing on college radio for months and I was hooked like an addict. A precursor to New Age but best filed under ""electronic"" or ""ambient"" music. This is NOT disposable wallpaper music like most new age. This is spiritual and meditational experience. It includes a great guitar solo by Hillage and both pieces build in intensity over their 17+ minutes each.. This was long before MIDI and digital sampling so except for the synth sounds, the guitar, electric piano, natural sounds and bells are real. This is one of the most transcendental albums ever."
1,Poor Quality - Get the Pioneer,"I liked the price, only about $11 but the $8.98 shipping made it less of a deal. I still purchased it only to have it arrive defective. When you look closely, one of the pins is out of position so you get no sound from the left channel. I emailed Discount Jungle. I got the ""send it back including all packing, manuals, description of problem"", etc. For a $11 cable??? Well, I simply threw this in the trash and bought the Pioneer version. $30 but shipped free and it is very high quality. Take my advise and stay away from this product and what I believe was less than superior customer service."
2,Works sometimes.,"The connection on this product was a bit finicky on the IP-Bus side. It had to be aligned with the moon when the wind was blowing at 3mph and only worked when turning left. Jokes aside, it was always halfway working."
4,Works as Advertised,"When I purchased this product I had read some reviews saying that I should buy the Pioneer cable, however this is cheaper and I'm kinda glad I saved money and bought it.I installed this myself on my Pioneer DEH-P6700MP head unit. The connecter fit snuggly in to the back of the receiver which was a relief, because I didn't want that falling out on me. I hooked up the RCA inputs to a RCA-to-3.5mm (1/8"") audio connector so I could use my MP3 player in my car (I don't have an iPod). That all worked out awesome as well, everything fit tight, and work as planned - I could now get sound from my AUX input.PS. It worked with my laptop as well.Unfortunately, I no longer have this in my car since my entire center console was stolen -- but I enjoyed the product while it was in my possession. I hope who ever took my stuff enjoys it too...100% satisfied recommend you buy this"
3,No difference,Just the same as the other ones although it may just be my tv it is 1080i hd tv but is worth the cost
4,Component Cable is Excellent,Excellent quality. The resolution of my Wii with this cable is as close as 720 p with an HDMI.... I recommend this products to everyone.
1,Defective cables — distorted image!,"These cables were malfunctioning on arrival. At first I thought it was my Wii, but now that I have tested my Wii with different HD cables and tested these cables with a different Wii, I have discovered that the cables themselves are defective. Of course the return policy was extremely short-lived, so it's far too late now to return them."
4,Works good.,"The cables work well, it's just impossible for the Wii to look good in 480p on a 1080p TV because the pixels are enormous."
4,It's a cable,"The cable itself is exactly what I thought it would be and it is a nice heavy duty cable, however, it did arrive two days late but I'm sure that was the bottleneck of snail mail."
3,Worked great! Saved my Wii!,"Our wii sat unused for over a year because after a lighting storm that took out a few of our other appliances it no longer showed video, but you could hear the audio. Ran into someone who told me to get an HDTV cable for the WII cause chances were that the AV went out on the WII. Researched several on amazon. Lot of bad reviews for these cheaper cables, but wasn't willing to fork out the cash for a OEM one in case that wasn't what was wrong with my wii! I choose this one because another reviewer said it worked for a similar issue. Shipping was a bit slow, but it was worth it! WORKS GREAT! My wii is back to life!! Picture is great on our HDTV."
4,hilarious!,"This book is so hilarious! I'm a Christian woman and I don't like churches and people who take life too seriously and don't think about having fun.This book is so hilarious and I laughed so hard until tears were coming out of my eyes. This is a great book, I reccomend this to any laid back Christian."
4,Artful and Well crafted synthpop,"After a dreadful early career as a glam rockband, Japan metamorphasized into a very sophisticated synthpop band. Obvious influences are Bowie and Roxy Music, but what saves this album from being derivative is a combination of beautiful synth arrangements, innovative bass (Mick Karn) and percussion, and David Sylvian's charismatic vocals. Standouts on this album are Nightporter and Swing. A British critic wrote that this was the most evocative deep soul ever made by white boys. Judge for yourself."
5,The Experience of Sublime,"Well - What can I say - This album is probably one of the most sonically adventurous releases from the whole period (early 80's). The keyboards are very subliminal - they work to create sonic ecosystems within which all the other participants may inhabit and bring their own contributions (including the listener).All said, Richard Barbieri is one of the most creative keyboardists alive.Steve Jansen's percussion is spot on in rhythm and feel and economical in approach."
5,In Retrospect....Still Great.,"Its been a long time since the first listen of this classic from the 1980's New Romatic hey day. But New Romantic, it never really was.... if you consider it's longevity.Over 20 years later, and still it stands the test of time.Mature crafted pop songs, with well thought out arrangments. It is clear they spent a long time putting together each track, to capture exactley what was best for the song.The singles ""Gentlemen Take Polariods"", and ""Swing"" open the album, and the further you dig, the more drawn in you'll become. ""Burning Bridges"", and ""New Career"" are two milestones tracks which pave the way for the rest of the album.The rest of the album goes by as smoothly as it began, including the ballad ""Nightporter""........ a small piece of songwriting history.A bonus on this album is the collaboration with Ryuichi Sakamoto on the closing track, ""Taking Islands In Africa"".If your after well written, and thoughtfully put together songs, this is for you."
1,NEGATIVE 6 QUADRILLION STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIES IS SO BAD IT'S SCARY.WHAT IN THE WORLD ISTHIS SUPPOSED TO BE.THE EDITING IS HORRIBLE,THE JOKES AREHORRIBLE........THIS IS SO BAD ITS ONLY GOOD TO USETHE DVD TO SCOOP UP VOMIT AND BILE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Deserves More Stars,"AHHHH!!!That's me venting my frustrating. I'm frustrated because writer Eric Kraft hasn't been getting nearly the attention he deserves for his work. It is hard to describe this book, I don't remember it in words so much as feelings. Feelings of joy, disappointment, sadness, anticipation, and above all satisfaction. Do not listen to the mediocre reviews, they are blind to the true genius of this book."
3,Disappointed in Soundrack,"I love all of this music, but each track is very brief and I'd wished for more music. It seems like each track could have been included in a longer edition. I was disappointed, but still love the music! There is 39 mins. of music total."
2,A Great Score?,"Am I listening to the same soundtrack as everyone else? I found the score of this film amazingly bland with each track having an average running time of 2 minutes. There's no substance, very little style, and at times is unbearably slow. What little color is there is very thin and pale and the ""orchestra"" (made up of perhaps five instruments) seem to just peddle along in a quick vignette without any time to reach a climax. I understand that this is a Jane Austin film and am not looking for a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" theme, but similar period films have been able to achieve soft music with depth, emotion, and substance. After hearing the first few tracks I was unbelievably bored and could hardly force myself to finish the CD. I'm definitely passing this one up for a ""real"" movie score. This hardly qualifies!"
5,Beautiful Music for a Beautiful Movie,My 16 year old daughter is the one who wanted this soundtrack. I am so blessed that my daughter would rather spend her money on this gorgeous soundtrack than the garbage that's out there in the music world today.
4,"Lovely music - suits the movie to a ""T"".","I very seldom buy a soundtrack but I made an exception for ""Pride and Prejudice"". I thought the composer not only captured the time period in which the movie took place but also the gamut of emotions throughout the film. One of the standout pieces is ""Liz on Top of the World"". After I bought the DVD, I decided I had to have the CD, too, so I could import some of the soundtrack to my iPod. Highly recommended if you're a hopeless romantic like I am!!!"
4,Powerful,"Pride and Prejudice is my favorite among Jane Austen's work. I was skeptical when this movie came out, because I enjoy the mini-series by A&E, but the music made me fall in love with the movie. The music is powerful on so many different levels and is its own character in the movie."
5,Excellent!,"I've now watched this 5 to 8 times. It's so good...we often are graced by more then we think we deserve, as Elizabeth is."
4,Introduces Dr. Laura Hobson,"Fans of PBS Masterpiece Mystery's ""Inspector Lewis"" may be interested to know that this is the book where the Dr. Laura Hobson character is first introduced. This was a good read that kept me guessing."
4,A pleasant read,"This should be a pleasant read for anyone who has watched the Inspector Morse shows on Masterpiece Theater. The character in the book is consistent with, but more fully developed than, the one on television."
1,Do not buy this recorder,"I bought this recorder for the purpose of recording meetings. The recordings needed to be transfered to my computer. All in all, it's a wonderful product. The reason for the bad review is in the difficulty (nigh unto impossible) of retreiving your recordings if you should happen to lose the CD that comes with the recorder. Panasonic's tech support is horrible at best. There is appearantly no way to replace the needed software or drivers via mail or download. The best solution I was given from Panasonic's technical support was to ""buy another one, copy the CD and return it."" Aside from the dubious legalities of that suggestion, I recommend not supporting a company that doesn't support their products."
1,Can't Recommend this or any other Panasonic Voice Recorder,"There is nothing wrong with the hardware. It is a fairly straight-forward implementation. My beef is software.Panasonic records in a proprietary format. It requires proprietary software to transfer your recordings from the device to any computer. Panasonic no longer supports the software, has not updated it for any operating system post Windows XP and provides no support for any other operating system (Mac OS, Linux, etc).Since this device is clearly abandoned by Panasonic, they should release the source code for a reference driver that would allow others to write drivers for it (Linux, MacOS, more modern Windows versions).Panasonic clearly does not want to support their customers. That is a real shame as I am now very unlikely to consider any Panasonic product in the future. I will also attempt to influence anyone else that I can do do the same.Do not purchase this or any other Panasonic products."
2,Don't Lose the Software!!!,"As was stated earlier, the recorder only works with the included software because it records in a proprietary format. After upgrading our network and having to create new user accounts, the software no longer worked and said it needed to be reinstalled and I have since lost the CD. Again, as stated earlier, there is nothing on the panasonic site that helps. I call and they want $25 for the CD, plus $8 shipping on a device that costs $70. Terrible, terrible customer service."
1,"Bad,BAD,BAD",This book has NOTHING to do with Forensic Accounting-the title is VERY deceptive-if you want a history of crime like who the Mafia is then go ahead and waste your time.....bad book
5,My favorite gluten free licorice,I have found good substitutions for most gluten filled foods with the exception of Licorice until now. I love this although it is expensive.
4,Almost totally pleased,"I loved the original Album and wanted it in CD, however I wish they would have included the original song list with (It bring a tear). Its a much better song than (Eye to Eye). Otherwise its the best Audience you can listen to."
4,Daevid Allen - 'Good Morning' (Caroline),"Originally released in 1976,as this was Daevid Allen's second solo outing.A rather good art rock/Canterbury record,I thought.'Good Morning' is a more acoustic set(w/no drums)that showcases some really nice glissando guitar work.Noticed that fellow Gong mate space whisper mistress Gilli Smyth shows up here.Tunes I was most impressed w/were the title track ""Good Morning"",""French Garden"",the eleven-minute ""Wise Man In Your Heart"" and ""Euterpe Gratitude Piece"".A should-have."
3,A great waste of time(i mean that in a good way),"This movie is clearly a ""B"". but what sets it apart is how much effort was put into creating it. Overall the CGI (Computer Generated imagery) wasn't outstanding but, the actors and the plot up to about the 3/4 mark was decent. the setting was new I have never seen this genre represented in a desert and it was well done. the fight scenes could have been given a little more screen time than they are but over all I would say if you are a fan of B movies than this will be a good time sink! Nicely done to the Actors and the support staff on this one. Have a good time and enjoy the movie all!"
3,Great TV Series - but the packaging can be improved,"I LOVE the show, and hence I had a friend to buy it from me, and deliver it across the ocean. However, there are a few things about this collection that disappointed me.As what were pointed out by some other reviewers:1. While the packaging looks great - it doesn't protect the DVD from being scratched. It's so bad, that I am afraid of taking the DVD out of the sleeve. I'm contemplating getting a separate case for the DVDs, but if that happens, what am I going to do with this fabulous box?! Just for showing off?!2. No English subtitle! Why?! And I thought all DVDs from the US will at the very least, provide subtitle for the hearing-impaired folks!3. I am not sure if any of you noticed, but the Pilot Script book that I got in the package had a printing error. Page 15 of the book should be on section 12, but instead it printed section 33 which is repeated from page 47. I want my original page 15!!"
2,POOR QUALITY OF DVDS,I just received the complete series and really enjoy the West Wing.I have watched the first 52 episodes. But the quality of the DVDS is very bad. Despite my best efforts at cleaning the disks I have missed 9 episodes so far. My DVD player will not play them. At this rate when I am finished I will miss about 26 episodes. So you may want to think twice before buying this series.
5,had to buy...,"We (a Canadian and an American) were watching via Netflix DVDs and just couldn't wait any longer, so bought the series.This is one of the best TV shows we've ever seen. We've been through the entire series several times.Highly recommended."
5,Never gets old!,"These series made me laugh and made me cry. Masterpiece! I was surprised to find additional DVD's included in the box set (interviews with actors and producers). Now my brother is also hooked up to The West Wing!Fast delivery, great quality. Thank you Amason!"
5,great tv show,A very enjoyable series. It is great to be able to watch the shows at our leisure without waiting the week in between episodes.
5,Great gift!,I got this as an amazon deal of the day and as a Christmas gift! I saved so much money I can afford to add to the gift and my sister is going to love it!
5,Fantastic,"This is a fantastic show that takes a bit of dedication to understand. The plot is both fast and drawn out, there are story arcs that are multiple seasons and story arcs that last less than a single episode, it's a great show."
2,Very disappointed,"Very disappointed in my purchase. The packaging was not as shown on the web site. Disks were not in a organizer as shown on the web site but in cheep protectors and thrown randomly in a red box. After some organizing, found two (?) disks were missing. Site says it is a 45 disk set, but received only 42. When vendor notified of missing disks, two replacement disks were sent and one was wrong. Still waiting for correct disks. Both had different labels and ISRC numbers from the ""collectors"" set. The set also did not contain the pamphlet that is shown on the web site. This can not be considered collectors set."
1,The Complete Series is Incomplete!,"My husband is a huge West Wing fan and I got him this set. He's been watching the series on the weekends and it was only this past weekend (months since I purchased boxed set)that he finished disk 17 and eagerly loaded disk 18. Unfortunately - disk 18 was not included. Instead - another copy of disk 15 was where disk 18 should have been. How can a set be called ""Complete"" when there is a disk missing?"
2,SCRATCHED DISCS,"Many, many dvd's in this collection are scratched. This was brand new, wrapped in plastic - so that's hard to explain other than poor production quality. Sadly, I'm finding this out as I go along on the series....very disappointing for the price."
2,Bait and switch,"I purchased a new set but when I opened the set it was evident that they sent me a refurbished set. The disks in series one were not in their proper sleeves, the flap on the outside of the set was torn and the season jackets were dog eared."
5,west wing,I bought the series and have watched it over and over!! I love the people and the stories.The tone of the stories were very informative.
5,The best of the best,I have been watching TV since Eisenhower was president. and a wide screen was about 13 inches. West Wing is by far and away my all time favorite series
3,mixed up discs,I have a hearing problem and the first five seasons of West Wing were great with good sound and closed captions.For seasons 6 and 7 I had to really jack up the volume and the only closed captions were in French and Spanish. useless to me.I am going to see how I can return a produThe West Wing: The Complete Series Collectionct for the very first time.
2,Nice show but not so good quality packaging,"As mentioned before by others, there were scratched discs in the set that came to me, now awaiting the new replacement, hopefully no more scratched discs.Today when watching season 6, discovered there were no english subtitles, which is strange as the amazon desription of the individual set of season 6 has got english subtitles. How come my set got no english subtitles, is it their production forgot to add in english subtitles?! Hopefully the new replacement will also fix this subtitle problem.."
3,Butt Out,"I don't expect MK & A videos to be deeply educational or fabulously PC, but I do expect them to be nice. The song BUTT OUT, sung to their younger sister, caused me to fast forward this video and then to tell my children we weren't going to watch it again. Other than that, it's the same as any of the other videos in terms of quality, storyline, etc."
5,One more true progressive gem.,Their second album i think. Not as good as Pawn hearts but almost. Haunting and unique music and voice. Highly recommend all VDGG records.
5,Why not in USA?,"Why isnt this movie out in Region 1 (USA) yet? Somebody should tell Disney to release this film here. Its one of my all time favorite movies. I would LOVE to have it, and I know there are others like me who would love to have it also."
2,HWHAT?!,"This is a powerful fan that can shoot a jet stream straight through your house, but it is quite loud, even at the lowest setting."
5,Great family flick!,"This movie was fun to watch with my kids! I love when I am able to find a movie the entire family can watch without worrying about bad language, sex and violence. Definately a must to own! I'm glad I ordered it! Love the families house in the movie....I would like the name of their decorator please. :)We love dogs in our home, so no matter how many dog movies there are out there...we do not tire of them!!"
4,Kids liked it....,"We (family) liked this movie. I expected it a bit more,... more action, more luaghs,... but it was good. I liked the story. Great for a saturday or sunday afternoon. Kids liked it (10 yol sister, and 6 yol brother). I guess you can't go wrong with the combination dogs and kids. Our 6yol son, was enchanted with Sonny. Nice dog. I can't remember watching another moive where a bulldog had a prominent role in it. Was about time. I'm thinking Nerf-fanatics will also certainly like this movie. It has to be inspirational to them. By the way,.... I loved the title."
1,Racist,TOTAL RACIST TRASH. Hitler could could not have done better. The negative racist stereotypes and racist portrayal of Sicilian Americans is disgusting and shocking. Any parents who allow their children to view this film are evil and degenerate and racist. RACISM MUST NOT BE PROMOTED.
5,The DogFather,"Very good movie for the entire family, kids just seem to love it and we all enjoyed this movie, Great DOG and fun to watch and you don't have to worry about content or words."
1,Wrong Size,"It works as a stylus, but it is too small, and does not stay in the Nintendo DS Original stylus slot."
5,Just what I was looking for.,"I don't know what the other reviews are saying about the stylus being too small. I ordered them for my original DS, and all three that came in the package fit perfectly. Maybe they were mailed the wrong ones. There is something on the back that says sometihng is adjustable, but I can't find it. Maybe that has something to do with the other reviews."
1,"Shipped Product Does Not Match Picture, Does Not Fit Original DS Holder","The primary picture for this item shows a pack of three original DS styluses that look exactly like the ones for the original (i.e. phat) DS.The shipped products were knockoffs that were too thick to fit the holder in my original DS. The shipped items have a clear nub while the original DS stylus is grey throughout. This would not be a problem except for the mismatch with the DS stylus slot. These MAY fit a DS Lite, but I don't have one so I don't know. I would, however, stay away from this item due to the uncertainty.Item is not as advertised. Buyer beware."
4,Disappointed with Amazon,"I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with Amazon. I paid $217 for this product. Page 2 of the manual listed what should have been included. Clearly it says replacement earpads. Three times I have contacted you. First by phone and was told I would be credited with it, second email which was ignored and 3, emailed customer service . I received a reply saying it would be investigated and would be in touch with me and then to be totally ignored leaves me totally disillusioned with the way Amazon handles customers.Pat Quinn"
4,It serves it's purpose,"I will start off by saying that I bought this product for my girlfriend. On the occasions when she stays up later than me, the TV is an issue. I bought these for her, and problem solved.Sound quality.The sound quality is not the greatest, but good enough. If you are a sound freak, and are planning on listening to piano concerts, this might not be for you. But for watching TV, it certainly serves it's purpose, much better than the speakers on my TV. My girlfriend seems quite happy with the product, specially since we both like to watch TV at different volume levels.Comfort.I find the piece to be a bit tight. I don't think I could use it for ours at a time. My girlfriend on the other hand doesn't seem to mind (yes, of course her head is smaller).The earbuds do stay in place though.Overall I am glad I bought this product. It solved a problem and made me a happy sleeper."
3,Easy to use,"I was concerned that brushing my new dogs teeth would be difficult, but he seems to be okay with it. The toothbrush is like a heavy duty version of ours, and it stands up to him biting on it. He seems to like the toothpaste.My only complaints are that I am unsure how much toothpast to use or even how much I have put on since its clear and soaks into the brush. Also it says it has grape seed in it and I read that grapes are poisonous to dogs. I am sure the makers of this product know what they are doing though.I'd buy it again, but I may buy a different toothpaste."
5,A excelent path to get the CCIE Security Certification.,The book covers basically all key areas involved on the Security network environment that is important to be prepared to the CCIE Lab Exam as well for the professionals on Security area. Excellent in content and it brings a real world exercises that links the theory to a practical hands-on scenarios. Execellent buy
3,SLOW,It had the basis of a good story if the author would quit continually rambling on and on and on about each of the main characters thoughts. I mean before either main character would speak at all you would have to read 10 pages of what they are thinking. Grrr get to the main story please!
3,Had The Potential!,"I admit to being a bit disappointed. The potential for a hot steamy romance was there. However, the pages and pages (really) of inner thoughts and conflicts instead of dialog between the characters made the story slow and tedious. It was too much of one and not enough of the other!I can't find too much fault with the story line. I thought Duncan could have been more feeling towards the child (regardless of his sire). The way he treated the child was odd and down right sad. Otherwise the story line was different, which made it interesting. The writer just wouldn't allow the characters to converse out loud.Hopefully, future works will correct this style of story telling. I'd be willing to give the author another read and hope for less focus on inner thoughts, descriptions and things that I spent too much time skipping to get to some dialog."
4,Shake your faith.,"This movie is a shaker.A rich mans tomb is found in Jerusalem, with a crucified man in it, from the time of Pontius Pilot.The implication is that Yeshua (Jesus) didn't raise from the dead.What a mystery. Everyone is shaken in this one. Antonio Banderas plays a priest sent by the Vatican to deal with this 'problem'.The content really makes you think as the many implications and possibilities arise for the Jews, Muslims and Christians in Jerusalem.Good footage of the city of Jerusalem.It is a PG rating, and has one swear word in it.Don't miss the very end!!!!!!!Recommend it....Pastor Brian HowardNew Water FellowshipSumner, Wa. 98390"
2,Interesting premise that becomes a really dumb film,"Finding the body of Christ is the key theme of this film. If the body were found, would it destroy Christianity? I will let you see this drek to determine the final answer.The film asks an interesting question. Unfortunately, it gets bogged down in setting up the question, that the author's answer is revealed long before the final reel. It is almost anti-climatic to watch the ending. Hollywood formula gone mad.The dialog is stilted and stupid. There are scientific, as well as storyline, inconsistencies, and it is, overall, a boring movie.There is one highlight. The cinematography is excellent. Some of the aerial shots will take your breath away, esp. if you enjoy glimpses of Jerusalem."
1,Good Concept Poor Execution,"This film adaptation of Richard Ben Sapir's novel ""The Body"" largely misses the impact the book makes. I do give credit to the screen writers for altering the book's plot to completely write out the role of the Soviets in exploiting the possible discovery of the unresurrected body of Christ. Of course, the book was written in the '70's when the world was deep in the Cold War so this element would be meaningless today. First off, I had trouble understanding the characters since everyone had heavy accents from several different languages. The movie plodded along without ever capitalizing on this rather novel concept: a discovery so powerful it could profoundly alter politics, the balance of power, and, of course, religion forever. Skip the movie, search for this out of print novel and read a rather exciting book."
3,"Nice looking frames, if not exciting","These are good frames. Nothing exciting, but they are as advertised. Good for school pictures and things like that. A decent value."
3,"Tried to cancel order, but it came anyway","Tried to cancel the order via email, but got no response. Product is sitting here still unopened because I didn't need it. It did come promptly, and it is probably nice."
1,Save your money,"Cute little book if your wallet is to big! Not a bit helpful, just cute. Spend your money on a book that is actually informative."
4,Accelertainment!!,"I bought this because my kids had seen the first one and I didn't even know it was a series of 4 movies. These are great movies, even I like watching them. My 3 year old loves watching these and uses their stories and characters when playing with his own hotwheels cars. I only wish they would continue making more as the story is very entertaining and kind of leaves you hanging even after the 4th movie. Can't wait for more."
4,what a bunch of no spellin' whiners,"I've been looking forward to this game after seeing screen shots for awhile.Im not as knocked out as i had hoped,but this is still a fun combat flight game.Very much an evolution in this category,but no revolution,unfortunatly.The graphics stand up well with the detailing of buildings and vehicles.There is noticable horizontal breakup/rolling in the background as you turn.It will be interesting to hear how it compares with the xbox version.Like GUN im sure this began life as a xbox title.Frankly speaking with elder scrolls, advanced warfighter and ea boxing out there,games that are truly beginning to use the 360s power.I would recommend a rental before purchase.Im having fun playing it.The best parts remind me of EAs Desert strike games."
2,blazing angels,this game was fun movement was kinda restricted due to the controller but the seller was great the game was in great condition and it was in a sealed packeage even though it was used
3,"Game is OK, needs a joystick.","I think the graphics is realistic, but compared to MS Flight Sim 3 it's not as good. Fun game, but there are better. Also, not the easiest to fly with the provided Xbox controller. You definitely need a joystick with this game."
4,excellent read.,This book is all that the historic novel reader might be looking for. I highly recommend it.
4,I Vote with the Maryland and California readers...,"I agree w/ Maryland and California that the contemporary part of the book was a little too pat to be believed. However, the historical parts of the book were fascinating -- so much so that I'm giving this book 4 stars. I'll suspend my disbelief in the contemporary (and instant!) romance.(After all so many novels out there are too unrealistic to be believed -- I'm thinking of Judith Krantz's stuff, Danielle Steele, Eileen Goudge, etc. etc.) A little escapism is okay, but I'd wait for the paperback if you want to buy it."
2,The Ghost of Hannah Mendes,"I was disappointed in this book. I had expected an historical novel juxtaposed with a present day moral crisis from a Sephardic Jewish perspective. While the storyline follows this format, the character development is extremely weak and the romantic relationship development reminds me of a Danielle Steele novel. The story centers on two sisters and a grandmother. We are not even told which sister is older, and are given limited insight into their childhood. I am almost finished the book, and am still waiting to get to know and to care about these characters. I had hoped for much more."
4,Great Book for IM residents,If you are looking for a comprehensive introduction to kidney disease as a resident - this is the book. It has as much information as you would want as a resident (probably more than you want!). Great reference for renal fellows who are just starting out.
4,Chinese Character Fast Finder,"A really helpful book in quickly looking up Chinese Characters, however, the book only covers 3,200 characters and therefore cannot be the only dictionary the you may own. It works well together with other dictionaries, and is especially helpful in finding common words that do not have a clear radical. Remembering that the common less complex words in Chinese are often the most difficult to find, this is where this book excels. Please also note that the book does not cover compound words therefore you need another source to truly understand the meaning of the word (especially in combination with other words). Just as in English if you did not know the meaning of the word ""honeymoon""; looking at the word would lead you astray. A Chinese equivalent is ""ma shang"" ""horse up"" means ""at once"", this book cannot help you with this situation, and therefore you must have other dictionaries together with this tool."
3,Good General Information,"Interesting reading for those who are looking to buy or sell their own properties. Very general, but some valid points in contract creation."
2,so so reading,"I agree with other posters and found this book to be pretty dull. For some reason I felt I had to finish it, but it wasn't an easy read. I kept adding up how many pages until the end."
2,Superb writing; not very interesting subjects,"Interracial relationships are neither as new nor as interesting as Ms. Lee seems to think. If she had self-knowledge - or the courage to acquire same - she could unsparingly examine her obsession and, hopefully, move her work beyond it."
5,The Lion's Game,I have not read this book but have enjoyed other books by Nelson DeMille. It was also a gift for my daughter in law and she was thrilled to receive it.
4,Good,It was very predictable but a fun read. I would recommend it for easy reading. Ending was not very satisfying.
4,great but that last page............,"I am a huge DeMille fan and waited with baited breath for this book to arrive. I wasn't disappointed through 647 pages.......it's only the last page that through me for a loop. That's it? I feel that a book this smart, this witty, with such interesting, intriguing characters and fast paced, well researched plot should have come to a far better conclusion than it did. It was a great read but I felt cheated."
3,Very Good Start...,"My sister had raved about how captivating this book was and I suppose my expectations were much higher than if she had said nothing. The very beginning of the book was very interesting, packed with action. The further I went, I found myself getting bored. The constant back-and forth between the good guys and the bad guys was tiresome. I wanted to say to the author ""C'mon, move it!""...This book should have been at least 40% shorter."
3,And..................,I read this book based on rave reviews from friends and family. Sorry to be negative but after somewhat enjoying two thirds of the book I found myself counting pages at the end wondering how the author was going finish off the book. As page after page turned I thought this has got to be one frantic ending until it fizzled out in front of me all the time screaming sequel!!!!I have been reading non fiction as of late and was thrlled I might have stumbled onto a new fiction writer I could enjoy and back track through his other novels once finished. Instead I was left with alot of promise unrealized. I suppose I will pick up another as there has to be some reason for his popularity but hope they end more definitively than this.
2,Game over,"Nelson Demille's The Lion's Game, featuring the enigmatic John Corey begins with considerable premise before descending into stereotype and obscurity. The type is typical action/mystery fare- a flight arrives in America with all its occupants dead. While this may seem riveting initially, Nelson Demille continues unsuccessfully to maintain interest through a string of murders as John Corey pursues the antagonist, with limited success.By far the book's biggest drawcard is its realism- Corey is often confused and at a loss to explain his failure to catch the assassin. However, this alone is not sufficient to raise the reader's interest. The ending, in particular is not satisfying."
4,A fun ride!,"REPOST of a review I accidently left under my wife's name/account. She would have given this book a 5 stars vs. my 4.One problem I had was I didn't feel there was resolution to the story. Talk about setting you up for the next book! Other than this, the book had very enjoyable characters, kept you guessing when the good guys would finally catch on, and had some side-splitting humor. The only other irritation I had was the feeling that it this book was one big marketing ploy: 1) about a half-dozen references to other books(with the hopes to get you interested in the others); and 2) already mentioned the end feeling that resolution never happened. If these two things don't bug you too, then the book is a must read"
4,GREAT READ!!!!!,"This was the first Demille book that I read. I used to only read Tom Clancy, how ignorant was I. Well needless to say since I have read the Lion's Game I just finished Gold Coast and now I am reading Plum Island. The plot of the Lion's Game is a little awkard with everything that happened on Sept 11th."
4,The Lion's Game,"Fun and enjoyable...I looked forward everyday on the train to see what was happening in the world of John Corey...very enjoyable. I did find it a little hard to believe with his romantic envolvement, it seemed to perfect and unrealistic..."
4,Can't put it down,"I open the book just as my flight departed Sydney, Australia and was left with only 100 pages before arriving in Boise, Idaho (No, it was not a slow plane). Being on my flight only added to the atmosphere and reality of the plot. I have a voracious appetite for novels and have only read a dozen in which I could not put the book down, and this is one of them. It was great to read something in which you can't see the sub plots, direction and outcome after the first 5 chapters. I highly recommend this to anyone."
3,A Disappointing Demille,"I rushed out and bought his new book the first day on the stands. I couldn't be a bigger fan! The book was entertaining but lacked the excitement of a twisted plot that to me is the fun of Demilles books. The plot was terribly predictable. The relationship between John and Kate was not developed...from bed to marriage for John Corey was inconsistent for his character. The roles, personalities and dynamics between the FBI, NYPD, and the CIA was tedious and overplayed...enough already! It lacked both plot and character development and intrigue. Corey's humor and banter were entertaining and there are some good story moments. Like one other reader expressed this won't keep me from waiting eagerly for the next book. But this one wasn't the quality of Gold Coast, The General's Daughter or Word of Honor."
2,Fairly disappointing,"After the fantastic 'Spencerville', 'Charm School' and 'Plum Island' reads, I was anxious for DeMille's latest. Unfortunately, after a great beginning, it turned out to be much like 'Gold Coast' in that not a whole lot actually happened in the book. And the ending was a complete disappointment. Obviously, he's left himself open to write a sequel, but at the reader's expense in this case, I'm afraid. Seven-hundred-and-some-odd pages, and you're just left hanging! I think the author's actual reason for writing this was to see if he could set a world-record for beginning paragraphs with the word 'Anyway'! He's had so many good books, though, that I'll give him another chance..."
5,I Couldn't put it down,"I was hooked and reeled in from the very first page! This was the best book I read in 2000. Nelson Demille's humor throughout the book along with the ability to make you a part of the chase, the desire to catch ""the bad guy"", all the more appealing. I could not put this book down, and was sorry when I finished it - I didn't want it to end! I cannot imagine anyone giving ""The Lion's Game"" anything less than 5 stars! I went out and bought ALL the Demille books I could find. Please thank this gifted story-teller for wonderful reads! Sincerely, Kathy Ames"
4,Good book!,I loved Plum Island so when this came out I ran to the store to pick it up. It was a large book that took a little longer to read (about a week) but it was very much worth the extra time. Something about his characters that keeps your eyes to the pages. I have no regrets in buying this book.
3,"Good, but Disappointing.","Fairly well done thriller, but one expects much more from this author. Certainly, it isn't up to his usual standards. This book has an odd structure and the ending seems rushed and perfunctory. A very disappointing effort and much less than what has come to be expected from N.D. I'm glad I waited for the paperback issue."
5,Worth waiting for!,"I have been a fan since Mr. DeMille's first book. I loved Plum Island and the John Corey character in particular (I have the same sarcastic sense of humor). I loved this book and cannot wait for the next installment of the Life Of John Corey. Hopefully the next book won't take so long but if it does, I'll be waiting!"
1,for tension and subtlety and grace in writing,"and then the villain thought his terrible thoughts and threatened with his terrible threats and wished his terrible wishes and then he killed the first person who was his assistant because no one should know he was there and to show he was really really nasty and impervious to disdainful odors and then he killed again and here is a nice list of yuck methodology wow, and then tried to kill the second person and told our hero he would kill him and then he killed his second assistant so no one would know he was here and then he phoned the police so they would know he was coming and then he killed again and thought his terrible thoughts and then and then,,oh and our hero thought he would get him and not to mention newsday who gave that bad book review, oh and then we remembered Reagan, and then,,,yawn"
4,"SERIAL KILLER ON A JIHAD. NYPD,FBI,CIA,TERRORISTS - WOW","In my wildest nightmares I couldn't have come up with a story line like this one. After the first 50 to 75 pages you are hooked. It's hard to see where this story will take you. The twists and turns are as wild as the ride to the ranch. The patter between the sexes was corny, but believable. This will be an HBO movie or a made-for-TV miniseries, bet on it. Not great literature, but an exciting read."
4,The Lion's Game is roaring good fun!,"Demille is aptly named, for ""The Lion's Game"" could just as easily be a blockbuster movie for that other Lion that Cecil created. What is most engaging about this book, beyond the patented satire and rapid-fire repartee, is that, not unlike other felines, the beasts in this story (FBI, CIA, ATTF) do indeed eat their young. Even though the body count continues to mount like dot com television commercials, Demille somehow maintains an aura of authenticity. If you love to read books that grip you with the flip of each page and that keep you awake at night, I strongly recommend this book and another book of like pedigree titled ""Inside Job: Deep Undercover as a Corporate Spy."" The only difference between the two is that ""Inside Job"" can be found in the non-fiction section of your virtual bookstore and it is at least five times as frightening...because, as I said, it can be found in the non-fiction section of your book store. Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!"
3,An ok read,"The other reviews cover the basic plot well, so I'll just add my general comments. I mostly liked John Corey in Plum Island but his crassness seems forced in this book. His detective smarts come across nicely but they are difficult to fully appreciate behind the rough veneer. I was disappointed * Spoilers Coming * his relationship with a previous flame falls apart without much explanation. The new affair is built mostly on a coworker relationship and is very artificial. The resolution to the main conflict in the book is not particularly satisfying and is a clear setup for a sequel.Overall this is an eerie book to read in the post-9/11 world. It has some fun, thrilling moments but it is too long and has the other flaws."
2,A Real Disappointment,"Compared to DeMille's other works, this is a total wash with unbelievable situations from the beginning. The book lacks depth and realism, he seriously overdoes the wisecracking, falls in love in 2 days, and the end is the greatest disappointment of all. Leaves the situation open for another book I will not read."
5,Great Characters,Nelson DeMille has done it again. John Corey is a great. Interesting story and a great ending for another Corey story. Can not wait to hear the lines that Dom Fanelli would bring if his character joins Corey in a higher profile.
3,Lost steam by page five hundred.,"Two thirds of the way through I was tired of all the wise cracking and hoping the plot would pick up. It didn't. Lousey ending, too many 'X-files' references and did DeMille have to take a shot at every critic who did not like the 'General's Daughter'. The movie did stink Nelson!"
2,Too many words and a terrible ending,"I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books but this may be my last. His stories are always interesting and fast paced but this one was far too wordy, too long and the ending was a real let-down. 673 pages of chasing a terrorist with no resolution at the end. Additionally, I am getting a bit fed-up with his abundant use of the ""F"" word. It adds nothing to the story or the characters. It was excessive in his novel ""The Generals Daughter"" and was even more so in this one. I can understand occassional profanity to make a character life-like, but he went overboard this time. It cheapens the story. Grisham doesn't do it and neither does Clancy. Both write great stories. DeMille should take a lesson from them."
1,Lion's Game,"This book was disturbing. After reading through page after page of ""meaningless details about the hero and his girl"" I found the plot eventually be unrewarding and the ending absolutely assinine.I will never pick up another DeMille book."
1,Wordy,"The first 40 pages were facinating. It was all down hill from thereon. Too long, too wordy and too predictable. Don't waste your time."
5,I'm a DeMille fan forever now!,"I read this book along with The Lion while we were on vacation. DeMille is a wonderful writer. He definitely masters suspense, but I expected that. What I didn't expect was how witty the writing is. The way he writes his main character, John Corey, is a humorous as it is humanizing. I really felt as though I got to know the man. When I say humorous, I don't mean cartoonish. He is believable but and remarkably adept at his work, but he takes a light approach to horrifying situations, perhaps as a defense mechanism, but it gives him a warm appeal. At the same time, the way DeMille writes about the villain in the story, the Lion, is terrifying. I kept opening and reading this book every chance I got and was sorry when it ended. I know I'll be reading more from DeMille, as my husband had just ordered more of his books!"
2,CAPITAL S-U-C-K-E-D,"i love robert pattinson but this movie it was boring it didnt get me interested, i actually wanted to watch it because it having to do with salvador dali but it was just confusing and i didnt like it at all :/"
5,Pleased with this movie,"To fully appreciate this movie, I think one needs to have a greater understanding of the kind of person Dali was. I enjoyed this peek into his eccentric lifestyle, which I have read was ultimately far crazier than what you'll even see here. Robert Pattinson pulled off this role beautifully and I could almost not imagine anyone else doing it so well. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly."
1,"Perhaps useful to quell anxiety, but it's not the best...","resource.The point of writing the application essays is to emphasize your candidacy while presenting yourself as unique ""fish"" among the ""school"" of applicants. While the examples and critiques are mildly interesting, they don't do that much to help you be yourself.A better, and more holistic analysis of positioning your entire application is presented in the Richard Montauk book, ""How to Get Into the Top MBA Programs.""If you're interested purely in the essay portion, the Harry Bauld ""On Writing the College Application Essay"" is much better because it adds a human (and humor) element to writing. (Don't be misled by the undergraduate flair: Harry Haggard and Sarah Bleary review B-school applications, too!)"
3,price increased,I was given a price when I checked out and it increased once the seller packed & shipped it.
3,In the top 35% of neo-Swing,"I've heard two of the tracks here on collection CDs (""Did Somebody Say Swing"" and ""Jump Up & Boogie"") and they rate in the top 35% of those tracks to my ears. On ""Enter Sandman"" and ""Buddah' Bounce"" at least, contrary to the negative reviews here, they play perfectly in tune, the trumpet playing is fine, the rhythm section is very energetic, and my feet tell me they do swing. Whatever they have done to get the bad karma of these other reviews, it isn't evident in these two cuts. The other tracks, I can't say. As for my own tastes, Lavay Smith (One Hour Mama) and Big Kahuna (Hawaiian Swing) top my own contemporary Swing charts."
1,Very bad recording,"This is a poor record. I have purchased records from most of the 'new' swing groups (i.e. BBVD, CPD, Brian Setzer, etc...) and this is the bottom of the barrel. I am very disapointed by what has turned out to be the worst purchase I have made in a while. Save your money."
2,Okay...yeah.,"Tihs would have been an AWESOME album...had Jaymz Bee done it. I am a lover and collector of swing/lounge covers of very NON Swing/Lounge songs, but this album just misses the mark with me. New Morty Show's lead male vocalist just grates on my nerves. Even Jaymz knows when not to sing! Want a VERY COOL swing/lounge cover album, try ""Cocktail: Shaken & Stirred"" or ""Sub Urban"" by Jaymz Bee, the Lounge King of Canada. He knows how to do it! :)"
1,NO THANKS!,This band is flogging their dead-horse style of weak cover material and lame distorted guitar on this debut album. The original songs are dreadful and the production is god-awful. I have seem them live and the project is equally and uninspiring and weak. This is a band that clearly lacks a direction and vision. What on earth do they think they are? Boring.
1,"""Mortyfied"" by this CD","I don't expect neo- or retro-swing to sound like the 1940's, this being the end of the 1990's. But at least the bands have to have a feel for swing, good instrumentals and great vocalists. I can't believe so many people rated this ""5"". I thought Lavay Smith was great and I enjoyed Squirrel Nut Zippers and Royal Crown Revue despite their un- evenness. This CD is not listenable. It sounds like a bunch of high school kids doing a bad revue from the mid-40's."
3,"monotonic, to say the least","Klaus Schultze first began as a drummer with names such as Ash Ra Temple and Walter Vegmuller. This is very clear on this album, since he holds the ability to make the almost absurd monotronic titletrack to swing. Its basically 29 minutes of one melody, programed on an analogic sequencer. In my opinion it's too heavy-going and you certainly need patience to really sit down and listen to it. But then again, perhaps this is the point exactly from the composer, since he sometimes holds the view that his music is best appreciated when NOT listened to very carefully. The second track is just bombastic big chords one after the other and it comes as no surprise that Klaus Schultze has dedicated this album to Richard Wagner. A bit too pretentious, even in my book."
5,Elektronik Impressionen,"""TIMEWIND"" is a real masterpiece. And it`s amazing to know that it was recorded in one go... I`ve been listening to it about every week since I got it. Every thing about it is fascinating!... Have a good listening, Tchau!"
4,Superb bag,The bag was compact - it packs down to something a bit bigger than a loaf of bread- yet had a decent temp. rating and enough wiggle room for a mummy bag. I liked the pillow pocket feature and the colors (blue and silver.) A slight downside was the zip does not extend the full length of the bag- it goes to about 3/4 length. It is probably a summer summer that could also extend into fall or spring. Due to the cool summer we were having it kept me warm through the night.
4,Great compact bag,"I got this bag recently and have so far used it for two nights. This is a terrific sleeping bag. The 30deg rating might be a bit optimistic, but if you use a sleeping pad underneath and don't sleep almost naked, I think you can pull it off.I'm 5'2"" and got the regular size. I can slide all the way down so that my feet touch the bottom of the bag and close up the top, leaving a small hole for air, for a really snug and warm sleeping cocoon.The bag packs down small enough that it fits inside my backpack, and it also very lightweight, at a little over 2 lbs. For this price, this bag is a great deal."
1,"Packs easy, not very warm","I bought this bag because I do hike in and hike out camping. I needed something light that packs small and at a 30 degree rating I thought I found the perfect bag. I do a lot of camping and I've never been as cold as I have been in this bag even at 50 degrees not to mention the zipper on this bag is lousy and very frustrating. I ended up buying a fleece liner and a down blanket to sleep on for extra insulation. Now I find myself defeating the purpose of packing light when half my pack is sleeping gear. I've finally had it with this bag after giving it enough chances so, I've decided to give it to my son for summer camping. If you are looking for warmth this is not the bag. Look into a good down bag, they pack easy and are made to keep you warm. I will miss the compactness of this bag though."
3,"For the price, great. For the critic, average.","After paying only 59.99 for a down comforter (and knowing what top quality ones cost) I surely cannot complain. Living in Texas the lightweight will do just fine; however if I move to Maine someday I would recommend spending a bit more on a thick comforter. The fill is average but what can you expect for a lightweight comforter AND it was marked down to a reasonable price. If you are looking for something to ""sink into"" then up your price range and keep looking."
3,Looks can be deceiving...,"Not a smart buy. The manufacturer's have definitely skipped on Quality, and the supposed price reduction is still not enough to compensate...You would do better to buy another product..."
2,Don't Lets Go to the Dogs Tonight,"Like my childhood wasn't weird enough, I have to read about another one? This was for my book club but I couldn't finish it."
5,"Powerful, lyrical, altogether transporting","I was stunned to see a series of negative customer reviews in and amongst those of readers like me who adored this book unreservedly. ""Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight"" is an amazing coming-of-age memoir of life in pre-revolution Rhodesia. Hilarious, furiously intelligent, and profoundly sad, Fuller's vibrant passion for her beloved Africa overrides all. I can only imagine that those who were bored with this book weren't up to the challenge of Fuller's dynamic and gorgeous prose."
5,The End of Rhodesia: As told by an average person.,"Those who are upset or dissatisfied with ""Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight"" tend to be too concerned with the fact that it didn't meet their own expectations of what a white person should think and feel about Africa. Women's issues, the treatment of Black Africans, and the Rhodesian War, for example. Fuller and her family are not members of a privileged, white ruling class, as some reviewers would have you believe. I inferred from the book that they are relatively poor, rootless, and prone to drink. They stay in Africa, even after the end of white-rule, because of a love of the land and the people.Fuller tells her story of an African youth the way it happened, and makes no apologies. ""Don't Let's"" is a terrifically interesting book, told from the point of view of someone who struggled time and time again and survived to tell about it."
5,"Alexander Fuller, my favorite -","I have read three of Alexandra Fuller's books. This is my favorite. The story begins, written by a young Alexandra, told almost abruptly, with both passion and a nonchalance at the same time. It is told as she lived it. Her 'unstructured' family, living in the bush of Africa, experiences both the agony and ecstasy of living in wild places, caring for wild animals and each other. I have recommended this book to several friends without an African connection. They all enjoyed it."
5,A Remarkable Childhood in a Remarkable Time and Place,"I was drawn to this book because I am a White person who lived in Africa under Black Rule.Alexandra Fuller got to experience White Rule, the transition to Black Rule, and Black Rule. But she was a child. And she remembers how those changes looked to her, how they affected her and her family, and how they molded her. But always thru the eyes of a child. A remarkable book."
3,Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight,Loved reading about life in Africa. The characters were very well rounded and interesting. My only complaint is that the story did not flow smoothly. I would just get into a phase of her life and then in the next chapter she was on to another phase of her life and did not finish with aspects of her life in the last chapter.
2,Too internal for my tastes,"Strange that a book centered around Africa, and so rich at times with descriptive passages, should leave me feeling so left out. The book really jumps when the narration concerns itself with the others around the Fullers, both white and black. However, the prose is overwritten when focusing in the family and self, and I never felt the narrator was more interesting than the landscape."
2,"Errrr, ummm ??","I usually devour every Stuart Woods I pick up. This is the first one I've put aside after about 2 1/2 chapters, simply because I had no sympathy for or empathy with protagonist. He struck me as an opportunistic lowlife, and I had no interest in following his career. It's probably a good story, otherwise, but I don't know firsthand."
3,No redeeming characters,I don't know what Mr. Woods was thinking of but this book is laden with people of an ilk that would defy most people's taste. I know...the title is L.A. Times after all. But surely there they can't all be bad....the ones not dead that is.
3,"Terrific album, lousy reissue","I have to warn people before plunking down the cash for the EMI reissue of 'Real Life' since every review just focuses on how good the album is. It IS very, very good! I'm not going to describe it too much since it's probably done better in other reviews. My complaint is about this reissue! It stinks! In the age of downloading, the only reason to buy a CD reissue is because of the packaging. This reissue has the story of Magazine in text and that's it! I opened the CD packaging hoping for photographs, lyrics and the obligatory liner notes which are fun to read. This was done by a major label so one would think they would have put more care into this. The reissue includes the two preceding singles as bonus tracks but it would have been nice we got to see photos of the picture sleeves. But no, just a thin book with some text. Otherwise, the album is a great, pioneering post-punk release from the former Buzzcocks singer and future PiL guitarist."
5,"Unseen but, true","As with many things in this so-called advanced civilization here in America, people(the media included) do not want to beleaive anything that an African American says has any merit until it hits Suburbia. I hope that the author of the Amazon review reads my review. This is a true depiction as best as I can tell from similiar stories from, you geussed it(people who were involved). As far as I can see, which seems to be a lot farther than the writer of Amazon's review this film is a very close depiction with true to life circumstances and outcomes. This after all was a documentary not an entertaining anecdote."
1,"This book is out of date, misleading, and worthless.","The Border Patrol has changed remarkably in the twenty years since this study guide was published. The Patrol Inspector position no longer exists, and the qualifications and testing procedures for the Border Patrol Agent (Trainee) position are quite different. This book is out of date and worthless for its intended purpose."
4,Joe Gunther: another Jesse Stone,I have read two in this series and like it very much. So far. Amazon compared Archer Mayor's Joe Gunther to Lee Child's Jack Reacher. I beg to differ. Gunther is more like Robert Parker's Jesse Stone. Very human. Self doubting. Borderlines is a successful second act to Mayor's Open Season. A solid first book. I will read the rest of the series.Gunther is a solid small town cop. He knows the territory. And the people. No high tech here. But the evil people are just as evil as those found in other successful series.Great story telling. Solid plot development. Good character renditions.
3,not adjustable,"This review is for the prenatal cradle with the V2 support. I am 5 mo pregnant with twins and feel huge. I bought this hoping it would relieve pelvic pressure and support my growing tummy. I bought a size that was completely by a few lbs larger than my current weight.Pros: It does work to support.Cons:The velcro that tightens the strap to support your tummy is at an odd angle and pokes uncomfortably through most panties. unless you wear great granny bloomers, you have to fiddle with it to even get it to fall within panty linesThere is absolutely no way to adjust the hip -- It is already uncomfortably tight! I don't see how this is going to last me thro even next 25 lbs though it claims all the way thro 50 lbs more when I am expanding sideways as well with twins. What a waste of ninety dollars.The other reviewers are right on about the straps always showing everywhere. If it worked comfortably, that would not be an issue for me since I need the support when I have to walk around."
4,I don't know...,"I really am not that sure about this oen. OK Japan were running out of steam after Tin Drum and The Quiet Life. But here he distanced himself somewhat too much from what made the combination of personalities in Japan so great. Actually his voice is not that great for these kind of intimate sketches that he delivers her. Red Guitar was good but not great and I rememeber the disappointment when I received the single back then. It is till a very beautiful record but I do not listen to it anymore, obviously. In that sense even a CD like Bestial Cluster by Mick Karn was musically more accomplished and I do still listen once or twice a year to it."
1,"Would work better without the ""vocals""","Interesting music and rhythms, if a bit austere, but the singing (I'm being generous) would have been better left out completely. As it is, it works as background music for the pretentious.As for 'a debt to Kraftwerk', mention of Kraftwerk in the same breath as this cd is laughable. ALL electronic music made in the last 30 years owes a debt to Kraftwerk, but that's as much as can be said vis-a-vis this work.Invoking Krafwerk is akin to keyword spam on internet auction sites."
1,Brutal.,"27 minutes of gibberish. Purportedly about the Sumerian 'gods', Zacharia Sitchen's research, and 'ancient astronauts', this mish-mash of whatever happens to strike the presenter's fancy (from Gilgamesh to the Yakima Valley to Bigfoot and beyond) is, at best, an amateurish compilation of utterly unrelated topics, and at worse, pointless nonsense. This isn't even the Cliff Notes version of any of the various subjects Ms. Andersen presents. Why this abomination ever made it to DVD is the only mystery left unsolved."
2,buyer beware you are not getting a deal...,Nowhere does it clarify that you are only getting one filter (perhaps purposefully?). I guess I should have read the other reviews more carefully but who in their right mind would only want one filter when you obviously need 2? If my TV remote needed new batteries would I go out and buy just one batterey? So considering shipping is $5 you will save your money buying one of the other ones.
5,Awesome Bag,When I first received this bag I was disappointed at the size. I had bought it to replace another bag I had been using for 10 years and wanted a larger one. The measurements made me believe it was larger but it looked smaller. I used it 3 weeks ago on a trip to Laramie/Denver. Wow I just kept putting clothes and items in it and there always seemed to be room for more. I love the square zipper on top and the side pockets. The front pocket it nice for toothpaste and tooth brushes and other long shaped items. The handle is very nice to carry the bag with. I couldn't believe how much stuff I was able to put in the end pocket. It was great. Built well and looks good. The zipper catches at times when zipping it but I don't mind.
1,Junk !,"Bag is a piece of junk, save your money,was working ok for my needs but out of nowhere 2 months into owning seems starting falling apart. Save your money and buy something else."
2,"Nice bag, but starts to fall apart after 3 month",I purchased this bag 3 months ago.The size of the bag is perfect for gym lockers. Side pockets are nicely designed for shoes and a shaving kit.The inside cover started to show signs of wear and tear in the 2nd month.The shoulder strap is connected to the bag by a metal latch. The metal latch has caused the nylon to rip. this results in the shoulder strap becoming disconnected from the bag as I walk down the street.Zippers are not as smooth as they were 3 months ago and are already showing signs of wear and tear. A quality gym bag should last at min 12 months. I am rather disappointed that I will be shopping for a new gym bag so soon.
4,Almost perfect.,"It's expandable, I like that, but the zippers aren't heavy duty enough. The green color is easy to spot from anywhere."
5,LOVE this bag!,"I purchased this one in green and I love the color. Very sporty looking for both men and women and not overly bright. I love this bag because it not only holds everything I need for my daily morning workout and necessities for getting ready for work, but it is also small enough to fit in your average gym locker. It has 3 exterior pockets: one for shoes (which are stored inside the bag, just entered from the outside), another pocket with a vent for wet wear or worn clothing, and a front pocket for whatever: money, cards, lock, phone, music player, keys, etc. I do not pack my dressy work clothes in this bag...I wouldn't in any bag. Nor do I take a hair dryer, but it would fit one plus my toiletries, my gym clothes, underclothes, a small towel and of course my shoes. It has a platic handle that snaps together as well as a shoulder strap with comfortable pad. It is smaller than your average gym or duffle bag. But, I see that as an advantage."
5,KATELAND,"FINE ART..My Plasma has turned into an Art Gallery by putting in MUSEUM TOUR i am being shown ONE HUNDRED PAINTINGS by all the GREAT ARTISTS such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, John Constable, Renoir, Edgar Degas, Jan Van Eyck, William Blake ect. All these magnifcent paintings are filled with beautiful color. AN ART LOVERS DREAM. Some of the scenes you will be seeing are BIRTH OF VENUS... NIGHT WATCH... THE TERRACE at SAINTE... THE LADY of SHALOTT... ROLIN MADONNA... THE THEATER BOX... THE HAY WAIN... THE BOATING PARTY LUNCHEON... MONA LISA... FAMILY REUNION... CREATION of ADAM... NEW ORLEANS COTTON EXCHANGE... HYLAS and the NYMPHS... And, WHISTLERS MOTHER is sitting there in her CHAIR. An EXCELLENT Display of ART. Accompanyed by nice background music. I Highly Recommend MUSEUM TOUR."
1,Triangular Bandages,"I ordered Dynarex Triangular Bandages, I received Ever Dixie triangular bandage. I contacted seller he tells me they are Dynarex, I have purchased Dynarex triangular bandages before. Dynarex puts there name on everything they sell, these were just generic in a plastic bag no labeling at all. Unless you knew what they were you would not. Would I buy again NO not only did they lie about the product they charge way to much for shipping"
5,You will learn more about relationship...,"I have been reading its book below: GOLDWYIN, R. M.; The patient and the Plastic Surgeon. Boston, Brown and Company, 1981, 256p. You are very clear in the statements. It is worthwhile to enter in contact he/she eats the information on the plastic Surgery. I like the way a lot and of the cases that it presents in your book. I am clinical psychologist and teacher of Vocational Guidance. I am in the middle of the doctoring. I do for the University of So Paulo."
4,Fresh and imaginative!,"Children's books sure aren't what they used to be! Landon Snow and the Auctor's Riddle by R.K. Mortenson is a charming, original and highly intelligent book. Landon is a likeable character, who, much like Alice in her Wonderland, finds himself thrust into a bizarre world that makes much rhyme but little reason. The Auctor's Riddle reveres learning and doesn't dumb anything down for the sake of the younger crowd. The imagery is top notch; the word play is fresh and imaginative. It's a book young readers will certainly enjoy, and one that older readers will delight in reading to their children. If this is the kind of work that Mortenson does in this impressive first novel, I look forward to seeing more from this writer in years to come."
3,Almost What I remembered,"Poor Picture quality and possibly a few scenes were cut or changed. I understand that this was a made for TV movie, but having an old Richard Pryor movie is worth the faults."
5,Black Brigade,This movie deals with racism...and the acting is first rate. It follows a platoon of soldiers that have a difficult task ahead of them...and feelings from the soldiers get revealed along the way.
1,Wait for paperback,The inaccuracies start very early. It really needs to be edited again. I am sorry I bought it. A wasted opportunity and a big step backwards for the author in my opinion.
4,Put a little bounce in your weight-loss steps!,"One of Diet Simple's most valuable contributions is that the author infuses the challenge of weight loss with an upbeat, can-do attitude - one that doesn't underestimate the obstacles to changing one's eating and exercise habits. Naturally, not every one of her suggestions will work for every body. But most folks are bound to find among these nuggets some helpful and doable steps to ease the journey to healthy eating."
5,Keep this book handy!,"Diet Simple has become my go-to guide for delicious and healthy meal and snack ideas. I keep it on my kitchen counter right next to the refrigerator. I pick it up before going out to eat or when I'm planning to cook for friends at home to remind me how to avoid piling on the calories just because there's a special occasion. The hearty soup recipes were all new to me and have become big favorites. I love that the sensible healthy eating tips are nothing drastic and so easy to incorporate into everyday life. And it was fun to read - like being with a really nice personal trainer. I'm looking forward to the new version, especially for hopefully more great recipes!"
1,Wrong Model # and Description,This is my second time trying to buy the Maxxum 70 model with the Digital Maximizer. Important feature. The model shipped to me was the Maxxum 70/SC. This is a small difference in model number but frustrating if you know the difference in performance. Talked to customer service and there are issues in getting the correct product shipped.
4,Bugdet but Good,"A good story with budget feel. I am a fan of WW2 movies and Fortress does not disappoint. This story of WW2 air battles and the emotional struggles of the individuals who fought them is both exciting and compelling to watch.Although, aside from Chris Owen (the Shermanator from American Pie goes airforce grunt), I did not recognize any of the actors in the film but I found their performances both strong and understated which helped me connect to the characters they portrayed.If you are a fan of war dramas like I am Fortress will be a good addition to your library."
2,OK but not what I was expecting.,Movie is OK as far as story but that is about as far as the good goes. The acting was amateur at best. Reminded me of a bunch of re-in actors trying to act. The in flight scenes were very nice even though you could tell they were computer graphics. The scenes showing the airfield were to cartoonish for me. All in all I am very disappointed in the film. Having to put out so much money for such a low budget film was the worst let down of all.
2,Ehh,"I love the fact that a movie showcasing a bomber crew was made, however without a huge budget, movies like these just won't work. The movie made due with what budget it had, and presumably got the best actors they could. However, no matter what, it just fell short."
3,Fortress,"The computer animation was impressive. The animation made the flying sequences seem real.The acting was OK, but they had a handicap with awful dialogue."
3,Kathy women handbag,"The item is OK, just a color is different from the image that the seller showed in the website"
5,Good Replacement,With an older ibook I didn't want to spend a lot for a replacement battery. This non-Apple replacement cost about $28 and it fit and holds a three hour charge after about a month of usage. I'm happy.
1,"DO NOT BUY, THE PRODUCT IS FAKE",Do not be tricked into purchasing this product. The product is NOT the really Cadbury Flake. Please see the other reviews as it will say the same thing. DO NOT BE TRICKED
1,stay away from Omron products,"This product sucked. I sent mine back to the company for service and they told me nothing was wrong with it. My doctor disagreed with the machines readings so a year after I bought this machine, I am in the market for it's replacement. I will never buy anything Omron again."
2,good but not consistent,I bought Omron HEM-711AC after reading all the good reviews. My only test if the unit is good is to check the blood pressure in both arms. If you get consistent results most of the time then you can believe the unit. In this case most of the time the reading were not consistent. Even the manafacturer recommends that you average out your last 3 readings.On any rate I returned it after testing it with all of my family memberes.
1,A very poor product,"I bought this product for my elderly mother, so that she could check her blood pressure at home. She was having a lot of trouble with her blood pressure, and her medications were being adjusted. She followed the directions very carefully. The readings that she got were extremely high and alarmed both her doctor and her. She had to make multiple trips to the office as a result of these readings. She brought the machine with her, to show the doctor how high it was reading, and each time, when he checked it with his machine it was much lower. It is obviously defective, and she contacted the manufacturer several times and got no response. I would recomend not buying this product."
4,blood pressure,Works well. Sometimes have to reset and do again. Hopefully will get better as I use it more.
1,Not reliable!,You can check your blood pressure three times in a row and each time you get a wildly different reading. Don't waste your money!
1,Very Disappointed,I recently purchased this product based on its good reviews. The other day I took it to my cardiologist and found that the Systolic Pressure is way off. Now I can pack it up and send to Omron to get fixed which means I won't have it for another 2 weeks. My health issues are very recent and I am trying to cope but something like this doesn't help!
2,Not satisfactory; am considering returning it.,Monitor is all over the place and never agrees with the one in the doctor's officde.
1,Don't recommend this BP monitor even though Consumr Rpt says it's top rated!,"Consumer's Reports just rated this a top buy (ranked #4) in automatic BP sensors. I was excited. Came quickly via Amazon, but the readings seemed quite high, over and over. I compared it to my neighbor's model, which commonly read about 8-11 points lower for each of us --- over and over. I then took it to my doctor's office and compared it there. Again, it came up about 10-12 points above their readings. I sent it back. I do not recommend this model at all (HEM 711-AC). Not sure what to recommend, but not this model. thx."
5,Exceptional product,"Well designed, well made - very well worth the money. In this age of crappy consumer goods it is remarkable to find a product this well made and designed."
3,Omron HEM-711AC for irregular pulse,Omron recommended the HEM-711 for obtaining blood pressure values for irregular heart beat. It does not give accurate values for an irregular pulse. It is fine for a normal pulse.
5,a winner,"we gave this to my son last year for christmas when he turned three. he was very happy with it but was on to other things. now, past three and a half years old, he loves it. he takes it with him and loves taking pictures of everything (yes, there was one of mommy on the toilet..i could have sworn i locked that door...that i promptly deleted). he also loves the games. there is tic tac toe, a memory game, and a match up game. the system is very intuitive, as he has no problem navigating here to there. he also feels good about himself when he matches correctly or takes a picture he thinks is great. it also is very durable. it has fallen several times with no problems. i don't even worry about it. battery life is good. he plays with his alot and we have had to change the batteries three times. it also has the wonderful feature of turning itself off when it is left on. we have also used the cable that connects the camera to the tv. my son enjoyed seeing the videos and pictures on the big screen."
5,Lots of fun,I bought this for my 3 year-old when he kept trying to use my camera. He loves it and takes pictures of everything. The picture quality isn't great but it's certainly good enough to make him happy. No complaints at all.
2,fun but poor photo quality,"My 4.5 year old son LOVES this camera he got for Christmas. He takes pictures of everything, and I don't feel I need to supervise him at all since it is a toy. He's dropped it once already, and it bounced quite nicely.However, the picture quality is HORRID. My old 110 camera I had as a child took better photos. Outdoor photos are better than indoor photos by a long shot, but all of them have a certain distance you have to stand at to get any sort of focus.I wish there were less features like graphics and games and more basic quality to the pictures."
2,Frustrating and poor quality,"We bought this for our 5 year old thinking it would be fun.What JUNK.This thing has to be keep still for 8 seconds, EIGHT SECONDS to acquire an image. It is like taking pictures in the Civil War.Needless to say, no 5 year old can stay still, or should have to stay still for 8 seconds.As for the good the ""good"" reviews, those people must have some really low standards for their technology.Our little boy was really sad that Santa sent something, broken.We sent it back to the North Pole for good.Don't bother with this product."
2,See for yourself,"Length:: 0:53 MinsThis is actual video that I shot in a very well lit room. This is the BEST video I have ever gotten from the camera. The photos are about the same quality.I would be happy with the camera as a toy if I hadn't paid $85 for it!I would say it is worth about $20-$25, but even my 4 year old think the pictures and videos stink."
4,Pretty good...,"We got this for our 4 year old son this past Christmas. He loves to run around with it and snap pictures of everyone.I only wish a few things for it: that it had recharge battery, that the flash was better (the pictures are quite dark) and that the screen had more light.My son has a hard time finding people in the screen to take their picture.Otherwise, its cool."
4,Wonderful First Camera,"This was purchased for my soon to be 3 nephew. He is tough on his toys as most boys are. He loves to walk around and take pictures of everyone, but when he is done it gets tossed. It is rugged enough and takes decent pictures, mostly with half of someone's head cutoff, but I am sure that is the photographer. Wonderful first camera."
4,Nephew loves it,I bought this for my 5 year old nephew for Christmas and he just loves it. He was taking pictures of anything & everything in sight. It took seconds for him to learn how to use it.
1,Deceptive POS,"Great idea. Miserable execution - false premise. This is not a multi pixel camera. It is .3 and you have to do some hocus pocus with each picture to get it up to its claimed resolution. But you don't get there and it is a PITA. Too bad as the kids loved it; but even the 3 year old said, ""Why are the pictures nut (sic) clear?"" For $70 a few $ could have been spent on the sensor. That would make it 5 star, as is it gets 0 stars as the picture and video quality are miserable."
1,Maybe we got a lemon?,"The camera has a delay when turning it on or taking photos. It's pretty frustrating for my 6 year old to use, and me too. I wouldn't spend the money on this again."
4,Satisfied Parent,"I have 2 and 5 year old girls and after the older got over the heartbreak of it not being pink and having rindstones as she had original asked for she warmed to it quickly. Especially when she was able to snap a picture of Santa in her house less then thirty minutes after opening the present. Picture quality is passable (1.3 mpix), movie quality a little worse but still easily viewable and recognizable. Camera has withstood a week in the house and still function which is more then I can say for some of the other Christmas presents. Overall excellent for kids to learn on or to practically pretend like they are taking pictures like the older folks. Lots of kid interesting features and the interface seemed easily mastered by the 5 yr old. Great first camera for kids to learn on and get respectable feedback on their efforts."
4,Excellent first camera,"This camera is a big hit around our house! We bought this as a Christmas present for our 4-year old son, and both he and our 2-year old love it. Lots of 'extra' fun features, and very intuitive. He's already planning on regularly e-mailing his pictures to family."
1,What a piece of junk.,"I haven't been this disappointed in a toy purchase...ever. I bought two of them, one for my son and one for my daughter. The only positive thing is they seem durable. Image quality is crap. Software is crap. I could have bought something great for the money spent on this worthless little plastic piece of garbage. I am sorry I bought them - I cannot recommend this product under any circumstances."
2,"Great Camera, but crap quality...","My nephew loved this camera when i got it for him, but after about a month it stopped working at all. We thought the batteries were dead when it would not turn on at all, but when we put in new batteries it still will not turn on at all. We called Vtech and they told us to push the reset button on the bottom of the camera, no luck. For $30-$50 i didn't expect a great quality camera, but i certainly expected more than 1 month out of it. From what i have read it is going to be pointless to try to get a new one from Vtech, i should have bought the fisher price camera even though it was cheaper with less features."
2,Terrible Pictures,"My 4 year old daughter received this camera for Christmas. While it is easy for her to use and very durable, the pictures are just TERRIBLE. The quality and the focus is awful. It is too bad, because I really enjoy seeing what she thinks is important to take a picture of -- but barely any of them are of good enough quality to save or print. I'd rather buy a slightly better, but less durable camera and just teach her to be careful. I almost never write reviews, but the functionality of this camera is such a disappointment, I felt I needed to let people know."
1,Hope that yours doesnt break... It takes 4+ months to get a replacement from VTECH!,"My 3 year old son received this as a christmas gift.It broke... I mean broke (whole thing shut down) several hrs later. Mailed it back to VTECH and we STILL have not received the replacement... seems they have been out of restock inventory for more than 3 months... funny since if you walk into any Target or Walmart in the country, you will find it on their shelves.I would not recommend this product based on the lousy customer service from VTECH."
1,Stoped working after second use,"This was a great camera for the 2 weeks it worked. My son was using it the second time and when he came back to play again it would not turn on. We replaced the batteries , set the reset button to no avail. He is so upset. he wanted to bring it on the vacation and now will have nothing. save your money"
2,Not a camera to take real pictures with,"I bought 2!! of these cameras for 3 year old daughters for Christmas. They love to take pictures with disposable cameras so I thought this would be a great gift. However, it does not take good pictures at all! If the subject is too close, the image is bleached out. If moving, it is blurry. Out of 100 pictures, none turned out. I even tried taking pictures with it. It took a great amount of skill (and completely still object) to turn out a not-so-great picture. Save your money and buy a disposable camera that can take pictures you can actually develop."
4,Better than I expected,"Although the picture is really dark- like you can't see what you are taking a pic of until the flash goes off and the pic is on the screen, I think it's pretty cool. My 5 year old boy just loves it. We have gone on special scenic trips so he can take pictures of lots of stuff! It has been dropped several times already and seems to be just fine so A+ for the durability!!"
2,Henckels Steak Knives,Not worth the price. Stamped steel. Save your money until you can get the forged version.
4,an excellent stand-alone for any pin-up/fetish gallery!,"An in depth look into the history of Stanton and his illustrations. Additional info into the publication of his work. This book will save the Specialty Pin-up and Fetish curious reader much time in that it covers a large variety of styles - year to year and publication variations - A very full overveiw of the style. As an art book, it is large, and may dominate some coffee tables. Also bear in mind that the subject-content isn't for the mainstream. Stanton's publications bring you through a wide variety of views, and Kroll's editing is very complimentary. If you are only a bit interested in the genre, and do not wish to buy lots of books, this one is your best find."
2,item was new and in great condition BUT the size was rediculous,this top was horribly wrong sized. it was very square and big... i havent worn it once and was very disappointed.
4,Cherry Bon Bon Molds,I have not used this product yet. We make Cherry Chocolates every Christmas. Have not beeen able to find deep enough molds. These appear to be deep enough.
2,"Works, but no great.","This card is a major pain to get to work.I installed first with the software on the cd and could not get rid of the 1 mbps problem. I then uninstalled everything, including removing the reg keys according to Linksys's forums. I also uninstalled my ethernet card and all its drivers.Finally I let windows install it and just installed the drivers from the Linksys website. It finally works but still does not get great speeds. It gets 4 bars and sits around 80 meg. Every so often it drops down to 30 or so and then bounces back. I can at least surf the network and was able to play some diablo 2 with little problem.This was a wrt160n -> wmp300n setup on windows XP pro and the wrt160n is wonderful, so I am blaming the card. I also have to keep the router set on 20mhz and not 40mhz or the card defaults to 1 mbps."
1,Run away,"I have had the wmp300n for almost a year. Built a new computer and everything worked like a dream until I threw in the 300N adapter. Lockups, dropped connections, hours and hours of reading support forums and trying diff. things. I even asked the Geek Squad at Best Buy if they knew anything about it and they were very tight lipped until I told them that I wasn't going to pay to have them come out because I already knew wmp300N had problems. No support. No patches till now. After installing the new patch, my up and down connection has leveled off at an amazing 1 meg/sec. Thats right, for a product that advertises extended range and 270mb/sec connection, its giving me 1mb/sec. What a bargain. Worst product ever. Do yourself a favor and visit the forum at linksys to see just how bad it is before buying this."
1,4 USED on amazon?,"Every time we find number of used item consist of same model we better watch out that product doesn't worth your shipping cost and time.I purchased one of open box/refurbeshed/used PCI wireless card here on amazon, I never found it working properly, it disconnects me every 5-10 minutes while my USB wireless adapter on different PC never had any issue, I contacted amazon to return this product right away..amazon refered me to the seller and sellers sent me some web link to visit and fill out the form, the link does not work and I replay back to the sellers, there was no response, today I try to fill out that form by visiting their website, this time it worked but told me that it is been over 30 days so I can not return the item!!!!!Fine I don't mind to lose some thing under $30.00 but I will make sure nobody else will get the same used item and lose the same amount of money and time.Thank you Amazon...and thank you the dishonest seller!!!!!!!"
1,Very unreliable,"This may be an XP problem, but I reboot weekly and have to re-associate with the access point at least once a month. I am preparing to toss this in the trash and buy something better (just about anything at this point)."
1,Do not buy this Adapter,If you run your computer for a few hours you will get the Windows Blue scree of death (A serious hardware error) This is a known issue with this and a few other Linksys adapters. They haven't done a good job here with the driver software. Do search on BSOD and WMP300N to see all the posts.
1,"Linksys WMP300N, crashes PC!","I'm returning the product tomorrow! Product worked great (!) the first day and I would've given it 5 stars if I posted the comment here that same day. It was fantastic to see 200+Mbps registration and worked as advertised. But subsequently the following days the computer intermittently crashes and you'll be greeted by the BSOD. Yes, as the other reviewer noted....DO scour the internet with the keywords ""BSOD WMP300N"" and you'll find out this is a recurring problem, unsolved as of this writing. Uploading new drivers at Linksys web sites and going through all the forums for tech advices did not help. It's a shame after all these years as a Linksys fan, I will have to see other competitors out there will be earning my business."
3,Depressing character study,"I agree with the other reviewers when they say that this book works more as a character study than as a novel. And it really succeeds, through the reactions, thoughts and dialogue of each character. Steinbeck shows no compassion for his characters here, as all of them hide dark, deceptive motives for the way they behave. In the end the book works like a mirror on which we are reflected, and the image that we get is shocking and depressing.The plot moves slowly, specially at the beginning, and then picks up as the bus starts its journey. I also thought that it would make a great play, its format seems to be more of a play than a novel.Read this novel if you like a good, realistic character study, but don't expect much entertainment."
2,A disappointing read,"I really struggled with the herione in this book. I found her immature, foolish in her actions and undeserving of the hero. Her continued dishonesty and professional ignorance went on for far too long and it hindered the story. It was hard to agree with her reasoning for lying to the hero when verification of the facts were so readily available. At no point did it occur to her to verify the source. By the end of the story, I was exhausted with her and the tedious storyline. However, the hero was wonderful. Jordan deserved a lot more. I felt he should have run from her, rather than to her at the end of the book. This woman was an idoit."
2,"Enjoyable film, horrible audio","This is a fun film, but the audio is horrendous. Terribly distorted. Hard to understand some of the dialogue. The old Roan DVD has much better audio. This picture, however is much improved on this blu-ray."
5,As much about poetic imagination as postwar Japan,"torn between a redemptive vision of culture and a globalizing hegemony of the right, this is a splendid and pithy novel that unlocks the sublime visionary power of William Blake (as revolutionary figure) to do global work inside post-imperial Japan and the US/Anglo hegemony. The son is caught between Blake the father and Los the son, and figures a way forward for all: Mutual Forgiveness is the Path to Eternity, said Blake to real politik. I love this novel, it taught me more about Blake and poetry than most poems I read, odd for a Japanese novelist to be tutoring this way!"
3,Over My Head,"This book has a lot of references to the works by William Blake, which makes it a difficult read. Additionally, Oe explains the writings of Blake and combines it with how it teaches him to understand his handicapped child. I felt like the novel was more autobiographical than fiction. Too deep for me at this point in my reading skill level. A good message though all throughout the novel."
1,Overrated,"Garbage. Often these sales advice books hide thier inanity under writerly flourish. Forget about that--we're talking about sales here, not freshman english. The only book that anyone looking to double, triple thier sales commissions should read is RJ Shook's ""Successful Telephone Selling in the 90's."" Everything else is ostentatious, ineffective sales rhetoric, including this junk...."
5,Surath's Book is Good Stuff,"Loved Don's book. Not only are his insights, advice and exercises clearly the result of trial and error over a long and successful career, but the information is highly useful for those of us not engaged in sales positions. Don's ability to write directly to his reader in a warm, approachable but seasoned voice made reading his book pure pleasure. His humor (often winningly self-deprecating) enhances the experience. When's the last time you read a motivational or business book you could call a page-turner? Highly recommend this book for anyone seeking a more confident, effective approach to winning, whether in sales, presentations, interviews or elsewhere."
4,"A new perspective of a principled, dedicated advocate","Essays and transcripts of speeches by Helen Keller, which reveal her true concerns and her work on behalf of others. For example, she advocated on behalf of public health measures to prevent causes of blindness. She advocated for social and economic reforms which she believed were morally just and socially necessary.Keller's concern for others shines through this text, transcending the specific political alignments she felt were necessary to achieve her goals, so that any reader of any political persuasion will find herein much value.Highly recommended."
4,"Early, Raw Lucinda","You can hear the youth and early songwriting from Lucinda on this cd and it gives us a glimpse of the talent that was just starting to emerge. I think this is one of the most overlooked records by Lucinda. I love her voice here and her songwriting is amazingly strong considering its just her 2nd record. It has a raw , rootsy feel to it and its still one of my favorites."
2,Pot developed a bulge on the bottom,I have had this set for many years and it was fine until one of the pots developed a bulge and it won't sit flat on the cooktop anymore making it pretty useless. I started looking for contact information and seems like I'm out of luck since they are out of business. The warranty was appealing when I bought the set but doesn't mean a thing if no one can honor it.
5,Excellent Start for a Tough subject,"I didn't think it was possible to have a Dummies book for SAP, but it seems that Joey and Jim did it. As an experienced basis admin I read with skepticism, but I truly believe this is a valuable asset for any technical resource looking to venture into the vast world of SAP. Joey provides comical yet expert commentary that would allow anyone new to this difficult landscape to get a leg up. Thanks for the enjoyable and educational read. When are you coming out with SAP for Advanced Dummies?"
4,Wish I had this book a year ago,"When I was first thrust into the arena as a BASIS administrator, the dirth of materials showing how to do even the most basic of tasks, made this a daunting task. This book would have made my job much easier a year ago. For the beginning administrator or consultant, this book would be an excellent addition to ones SAP R/3 library (If only for the chuckles you would get for having it on the shelf)"
5,Bravo!,"Page turner and very entertaining quick read. Bravo! Obviously, not as good as the great classics of the era but a very entertaining ""new"" book to quench the thirst for more Rebecca, Emma, etc. books without investing too much time."
4,Like Barbara Cartland rewritten by Edith Wharton,"Set in Victorian New York,this is a romance, a mystery and a pleasure to read. The plot concerns Mario Alfieri, the world's greatest tenor - and lover. Searching for a house to rent, he encounters the mysterious Clara Adler, 19-year old Jeiwsh ward of a multi-millionaire, recently deceased. Clara has rarely been seen, living in seclusion in the house in Gramercy Park, and was so ill after her guardian's death, which left her destitute, that she was not expected to live. Mario falls in love with her, and marries her, rescuing Clara from the clutches of the evil lawyer Chadwick. But not for long. Clara's past conceals a horrible secret...P>What saves the novel from mere historical romance is the author's love of her characters, her evident passion for opera and a grasp of Whartonesque wit. Throughly enjoyable."
4,A useful mini coffee-table type book.,"This is a ""mini"" coffee-table book. It's a pleasant read, and pleasant to go back and read every so often. Interspersed throughout the book are photographs, quotations, and a number of helpful small hints about helping you get organized. It goes over general organization issues, including organizing/storing clothing. It doesn't hold your hand and go through how to organize in 1 particular way, but it offers helpful small suggestions in how to do so."
2,The Oxford Companion to the English Language,"There are many things I would like to know about the English Language, but too few of them are here. For example the history of English is disposed of in three pages. I should have liked to have seen 30 or so. To be sure there are other historical entries, though insufficient cross referencing. The chronology following the above entry is largely of English history rather than of language history. In place of these things are pages of information one could do without; trivia relating to broadcasting or editions of dictionaries. A topical index would have been nice. Every true philologist will nonetheless want this work."
4,"Cute boots, but runs small in calf!","These boots are great for their purpose (Wonder Woman costume, which shouldn't surprise), but to echo other feedback, the calf size is VERY small. My calf is about 16 inches around it's widest part, and I can barely get the boots zipped halfway. They are not stretchy at all because of the patent leather. If you can sew (as I can), you may be able to insert elastic on the back or zipper to accommodate this, but otherwise you might want to consider a different purchase."
2,Not the Greatest FOR ME.,"An ok read for me. I'm not to much into Ed McBain themes, yet I thought I'd try once more and give him a try after I had read others' reviews. Now, you may find this a great mystery(killer) book. I just didn't."
1,Unable to Get Correct Item Ordered,As hard as I have tried i have been unable to receive the correct product. I ordered the body fat analyzer and was sent the body fat loss product. I need help to get the correct product. Help me Please!!!
3,Very reliable but they could still make improvements,"I like this holster, but I enjoy hiking alot but I find that the hard plastic holster actually make my hip a bit achy after a couple of hours. I wish that they could make a rigid type holster, but would be more comfortable while wearing after hours of very active physical activity."
1,Mounce on Pragmatism,"The Two Pragmatisms is for and about Mounce. The four pragmatists covered (Pierce, James, Dewey, Rorty) get a few pages of summary at the begginning of each chapter, the remaining bulk of the book is about the authors personal ideas. Mounce is a religous man, and strongly attacks both Dewey and Rorty. If you are interested in Mounce and his ideas, then read this book, otherwise take a pass. I found it disappointing, poorly written, and really only suitable for Mouncian scholars."
3,Am I being picky,"Let me start by saying, of all the posters I found, I did like this the most. It's giant, laminated. Looks great, but right in the center, right dead center is a big square about 4x6 and it says, ""Antique Style World Map. American Map Company.""I would be much happier if that weren't right in the center. Maybe I'm picky. I'd say buy this, it's beuatiful, but when it arrives and you hang that darn.... 50x38 poster it's awesome. But please tell me if that little label bothers you."
3,Nice map,"I have this on my wall,and everytime I want to find a place in the world,I look at it.It's very useful.I like it alot.Happy to have it.Would recommend"
3,Definitely worth it,"4 and 5 star reviews tend to be given out quite liberally on this site, so it may seem that 3 stars would signify dissatisfaction with this album. This is certainly not the case, as it is a damn good album. Trying to compare is to Nasum's work is something I can't really avoid, but it is a useless comparison between two very different bands.This is good stuff here. It's very worth buying, even if only for the awesome packaging and art. The songs are heavy, fast, and skillfully performed while still sounding pretty raw. The guitar playing is particularly impressive, and it is what causes this album to cross genres from grindcore into more melodic metal territory. The vocals are nice and gritty and blend in nice, and I really appreciate that the drums are not triggered, which gives this album a unique and, as I said, raw sound."
5,My favorite step counter yet!,"I love that this step counter is very easy to use. The cover never pops open, which was an issue with other step counters. Also since there is a cover, you don't accidentally reset your steps. For the price, it is the best value."
4,WOW,I DON'T HAVE TO CONSTANTLY RESET IT!! THE BELT CLIP IS WONDERFUL. SUCH A LITTLE PRICE FOR A GREAT PRODUCT.GET IT !!
3,No timer,"This was one of my first pedometers when I started walking and like everyone else, found it easy to use. I recently found it, bought batteries for it, and it's great, but I realized that it has no 'timer' on it. It has a clock, but it doesn't tell you how long you have been walking. I ordered another one while my first one was lost, but will probably be sending it back to purchase one that has the actual timer, not just a clock. Otherwise, it's great for people that are more interested in steps and not so much time because once set up right, it's very accurate."
2,count your steps while sitting!!,"This pedometer is for real couch potatos! It is overly sensitive, even with the sensitivity adjustment turned down, so that it over-counts steps. This is most notable when worn around the house where it just doesn't keep an accurate count at all. It does work fine for walking for esercise, when you have a steady measured pace, but this isn't the time most people really want or need a pedometer....."
3,Nice Product,I really liked this Pedometer and wore it everyday till the battery ran out. Then I could not find a replacement anywhere. I tried the web site and they did not offer any help. Will keep looking because I really liked this pedometer. Easy to set and use.
5,"Slim, Sleek, Sturdy, Silent","The Omron HJ-105 Pedometer is Slim, Sleek, Sturdy, and Silent. It is slender, fitting smoothly against your body. It can be worn almost unnoticeably under your outer clothing. This pedometer is nearly silent; much quieter than the other two pedometers I own. It probably has a noise dampener in it. The belt hinge and face swivel is studier than other pedometers. My Sportline broke within the first week."
2,Too complicated for the task,"I have used pedometers before and they just show the number of steps. I did not want or need a course in how to program a complicated system for computing many things in order to use the pedometer. It matters not how long my strides are or how much I weigh. All I want to know is how many steps I ordinarily do and then increase them to increase my lung capacity leg and back strength. It builds self esteem and self confidence.I will continue to use my old pedometer and try to program my new one, but the ones I bought for my husband and daughter to encourage them to more physical fitness will lie in a drawer with the instructions because it took too much time and effort to analyze.Please quit trying to make things more digital and complicated when it is only a $12 item and wanted for one thing.Thank youAlice Brown"
5,Great Little Pedometer,Got this for a walk group at work. Came quickly and is really easy to operate. The instructions indicate that if you are wearing sandals that it might not record your steps. This is absolutely true with my athletic styled sandals. Not true with the dress sandals I wear for work. Has to be parallel to the floor. I clip mine on my waistband or in the middle of my bra (hooked on my bra it worked with the athletic sandals - go figure!).
3,Too much detail - more action needed,"I agree with Peter Werner's review. I have loved the Alex Deleware books in the past. This is one of his first that i just happened to miss. However, it was boring in many parts - lots of detailed abot phych that was boring and could have been summarized. I started not to finish it, but I finally plugged on. He certainly has improved his writing since this book. CJ"
5,Helpful collection for teachers and fans,"Hearne has provided Beauty and the Beast fans and teachers with two valuable resources. Her first book, Beauty and the Beast : Visions and Revisions of an Old Tale, discusses the history and various versions of the tale. This book, Beauties and Beasts, is a collection of tales that are related to the well-known Beauty and the Beast tale. The tales come from various cultures and periods in history. Hearne provides short discussions of the tales, but mostly allows them to speak for themselves. The stories are suitable for all ages so the book will work well in the classroom, library or at home. The book emphasizes humanity's similarities and differences across time and space by presenting a small collection of its folklore."
1,Don't buy from company,"Power board failed within a couple years of purchase. Company won't help and independent service centers don't even like dealing with them. Apparently, Delonghi, never heard of service after the sale. Customer support people were rude and made me feel like they were doing me a favor talking with me. I will never buy another product from this manufacturer and highly recommend you don't either."
2,below average,"I paid for 2,3 day delivery and did not receive the product for almost 2 weeks. I don't know if it was the seller or the post office but I think it was shipped by mule train."
5,"Nature's Way Hydraplenish with MSM, 60 Vcaps.","I have used this product for approximately 1 year-I use to have cramped fingers from using the ""mouse"" and ""keyboard"" however, the pain and aggravation is gone-I will continue to order and use this product as directed."
5,miracle!,"Five years ago, I had painful arthritis in my hands, especially in my thumbs, which xrays confirmed, despite taking a glucosamine preparation for years. At the suggestion of Dr. Whitaker's newsletter, I started taking first hyaluronic acid and then this combination. Within a couple of months, all the pain was gone, and I have never experienced a moment of pain since. Get this and take it faithfully and you may be amazed!"
4,Collagen AND Hyaluronic Acid,"When I ordered this product, it was the price which attracted me. However, I couldn't find anything about the ingredients or dosage. It ended up not being as economical as I thought, because the dosage is TWO capsules, not one, like other products. The incredients are Hydrolized Collagen 600 mg, Chondroitin Sulfate 200 mg, Hyaluronic Acid 100 mg, MSM 500 mg. I am already getting chondroitin sulfate and MSM in a larger dose in another supplement, and I never tried taking collagen before. I would have like more information about the dose and ingredients before ordering which is why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars. We decided to give the product a fair try, and so far it seems to be helping."
3,"Elegant writing, short on action","As with the previous four Aubrey-Maturin books, this one is well-written. Humor abounds, and the richness of character is beautifully done. It's also similar to the other four in its paucity of action. Alexander Kent's Bolitho series and Dudley Pope's Ramage tales are much better for vivid action, and include the same level of detail that O'Brian used so well. I plan to read the rest of this series, partly because I enjoy the interplay between the main characters so much. One minor point that grows irritating as the books go on: O'Brian used ""cried"" as a verb much too often, would have been nice if someone had mentioned that to him as constructive criticism early on. Overall, though, ""Desolation Island"" is recommended reading."
4,The Best Yet,"O'Brian has warmed up to his characters in Desolation Island, especially Dr Maturin. Maturin's fascination with exotic creatures, both animal and human, his addiction to opium, his activities as a spy, and his tragic losses in love make him the more interesting of the two main characters. But it was the cliff-hanger ending which forced me to head straight for the library to obtain book 6 in the series on the day that I finished Desolation Island.This is my favorite so far, but each one gets better than the last. I highly recommend Desolation Island."
5,THE BEST!!!!,"I just received my package today and I couldn't wait to try this. These Strawberry laces are the BEST! They remind me of my childhood, before they started adding all the high fructose this and that to products. Best of all, I can actually for the first time in my life eat a piece of licorice and not be sick! I know some gluten free items don't meet up to the expectations and taste of the ""regular"" stuff. TRY THESE!! They will be on your shopping list all the time and anyone who is on a gluten free diet will LOVE to be sent this treat! Make sure you have enough for yourself as you won't want to be without it."
1,More like shoe laces,"We recently discovered my daughter has food alergies. Since before Halloween, I've been trolling the internet looking for candy that she can eat. She loves chocolate but it's not enough variety. When I saw these I got very excited because she's wanted to try twizzlers but can't. Fortunately, I tried them first. There is a very faint taste of strawberry-like flavor but what little flavor I was able to crush out of these things was not worth the work my jaws had to put in to get it. Even as I write this, having tossed the package away 20 minutes ago, I have a rather nasty after-taste even Lifebouy might not get out. Nice story on the packaging about how the company came about but the story is far more satisfying than the product. No thank you."
2,sony should stick to TVs,"These speakers are big in size but short on performance. Except for the price tag, not much else excites one about them. They make a good surround sound system with the Sony 3 speaker set for surround sound, but for listening to music you are better off with a set of good bookshelf speakers with a decent sub. These speakers lack bass inspite of their size, and sound quality is poor at higher volumes"
3,They do the trick,"At one time in my life I had a good 2k in my stereo system. So now I'm not in that kind of situation, and I've been making due with half decent PC speakers for a couple of years, opting to do most of my listening in a good pair of Grado headphones (recommended also.) Then I'm in this thrift store and I see a couple of these things for $15. They're pretty beat up and of course the grills were gone. So I'm thinking hey how can I go wrong? At 15 bucks at least they will be a nice base for a coffee table. I was surprised. They aren't my old Meadowlark Kestrels, but you know what? They're not too shabby. If I were paying 150 bucks or so for speakers, I would likely get Celestion bookshelves. But if you can find these for about a hundred or less you won't resent your purchase."
5,Great shoe! Cool looking and comfortable.,"I love these shoes. I am a teacher and the kids in my class think my shoes are ""cool""... and so do I. I will likely buy another pair for when these wear out.... if they ever do."
5,simply wicked,"Disappointed by family life, particularly her relationship with her mother, Mini rebels and becomes a person without remorse. She becomes a prostitute, in fact her stepfather is her second client. They start an affair and eventually team up to drive her mother insane, it works too well, and soon are investigated by a detective. Mini's First Time has no moral conscience so its definitely not for everyone, but for those who love imperfect characters and like femme fatales then this movie might be for you."
4,Another stupid man falls victim,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! The only reason that I didn't rate it a five is because the ending was a little too predictable. However, I always enjoy seeing a beautiful, relentless, intelligent woman whose skilled in the deception of man. This movie just reiterates the fact that men lose their whole entire focus and common sense when consumed by the power of lust and the beauty of flesh. Very well done!"
1,Sheer trash,"This is a really bad movie. Badly directed, bad taste, bad acting by the leading actress. Every character is annoying and the few attempts at humor ares disastrous."
2,Silly,"A silly movie, typical Baldwin old man young woman movie. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Waste of money and time."
3,"A few gems, but otherwise for ethnomusicologists only","There are a few gems on this compilation of Eastern European field recordings. The two Lithuanian lullabys, sung by Veronika Povilionien, are lilting and wonderful. (And especially charming is the giggle of one of the singer's grandchildren during the first song.) There are also truly stunning examples of Tuvan throat singing---the best I've ever heard. I listen to A LOT of Eastern European vocal music, and I have an appreciation for the raw beauty of the vocal techniques and styles. However, most of the other material on this recording is music that only a hard-core ethnomusicologist could love. Still, they are excellent examples of the kind of regional music that was passed down from generation to generation."
5,charms,"Very sturdily made and packaged very well. It arrived promptly. A very pretty, shiny charm that looks lovely on my bracelet. Be sure you read the dimensions for the charm so as to not have any misconceptions of the size."
4,Country of origin,"This is a delightful boot. The shearling liner is nothing short of luxurious for cold feet. Construction seems good (but I'm only wearing them for the first time) and the fit is exactly as described: these boots run large.A note on why I withheld a star: I chose Uggs over another Aussie brand and paid considerably more because I thought I was getting an Australian boot. Wrong! I was dismayed to see the sticker on the bottom of the boot explaining the lambskin came from Australia, but the boot was made in, where else, China. I was most disappointed. Country of origin needs to be noted so purchasers may make informed choices.I was also less than thrilled with shipping time. Amazon Prime offers free two day shipping, but it still took my boots twice as long to arrive, even though they were offered as a Prime product.Still, my feet ARE toasty, and that makes me terribly happy."
5,Must wear them in bare feet,"So warm......especially love to wear them in my bare feet. They are very comfortable, like wearing a big socks. I told all my kids to get them."
1,Really?,I am unable to fathom the success of these hideous boots. If I wore these I would have to kick my own a$$.
4,Only when the sun shines brightly,"Fans of Magnus Mills would enjoy this short collection of stories. Mills writes in simple, understated prose and has become famous for his dead-pan style that contains dry, dark humour."
5,Great!!!,"Perfect product and fast shipping. Affordable price. Facts about math and other stuff. Very educational. The book is heavy, but contains a lot of great facts."
5,Beat's Cutter,This is the best stuff. I just ordered another 6 bottles. It tames Houston mosquitoes. They are really vicious this year. I don't think the city is spraying as much.
3,Actual Performance Data,"I have collected actual performance data for this LED unit, as installed in a 3 D-cell Maglite operating in air at 65 F, with a Sekonic L-508 Light Meter. Since the Sekonic only reports Exposure Values (EV) to the nearest 10th of a stop, there is significant coarseness to the data, but the trend is obvious. Assuming the Sekonic is accurate to the displayed precision, after about ten minutes of operation, the LED brightness stabilizes at approximately 15.4%, +/- 1%, of its initial brightness, even though the supply voltage is maintained at 4.5V.time (sec), EV, Percent of Initial Brightness0, 12.5, 10010, 12, 7120, 11.8, 6240, 11.6, 5460, 11.4, 4780, 11.2, 41100, 11.1, 38140, 10.9, 33180, 10.8, 31220, 10.5, 25260, 10.4, 23300, 10.3, 22400, 10, 18500, 9.9, 16600, 9.8, 15"
2,"Not comprehensive, questionably organized","This is a decent book, but I find many, many mushrooms which simply aren't represented. I also dislike the organization by vegetation zone; there's simply too much crossover in a place like Hawaii. There's no taxonomy key either, so I find myself falling back to the aging standard:Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi"
1,not impressing,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. The playing is simply bad, no intonation=nothing for me and that's what this record is to me by listening to the samples which were enough for me to determine how bad it really is..don't waste your money."
4,Thoughts in Upheaval,"Though Velikovsky's theories are varied and somewhat happen-stance, his suggestions make one take notice or our planet's strange past. Like many other researcbers Velikovsky tries too hard to make ""everything"" fit his ideas when one or two would be satisfactory. By making everything ""fit"" together he tends to discredit even his most sound concepts. Still, an enlightening read."
2,disappointed by size,"I'm very disappointed because of size. I ordered size ""M"".It seems that tag is incorrectly attached. I's obviously ""L"" or even ""XL"" size.Was not expecting such stupid mistake from Outer Banks.Quality is good and color, but size..."
3,Not The Original,"This book was read to me as a child, so I bought it for my son. While it still held its charm I noticed it was not exactly the original. This 2000 re-print bowed to the alter of political correctness and removed the references to Indians. The two ""changed"" pictures are a distinctly different quality as well.(In the original, he doesn't hunt bank robbers... and his ""dream"" is different...)"
4,Good set,"I got this table and chair set for my two-year-old a few months ago, and I've been pretty happy with it. The table is a perfect size, and looks MUCH better with the crayon marks than our dining room table did. The set is durable, but light enough for my little girl to carry it out to the living room when she wants to color while watching cartoons. The only complaint I have is that the chairs do tip somewhat easily, but in spite of that I would recommend this set. Just don't try to use the chairs for ""time-out""..."
5,Works for my 1.5 year old,"He sits in it when watching TV, flipping through a book or playing with his toys. Durable, light, and cleans up well. Can't go wrong."
3,"Good value, but moves too easy","Good value for the table, convenient and small, but each piece is so lite that i have to hold the chair when my child wants to get on it or else they fall. Have to find suction cups or some kind of gripping adhesive for the bottom of the table and chairs. Otherwise, i recommend placing this on a carpet to limit the movement."
4,Loving our Litte Tikes Table and Chairs Set,"I bought my 21 month old daughter this table & chair set, and we love it. She loves it because she can easily sit in her chair and play with her puzzles and play dough.I love it because of its color & the fact that she will sit there for at least 1/2 hr to an hour playing herself!Just one tip (based on experience), adults should not sit on the chairs (no matter what you weigh) because they really are just for kids."
4,Great for review of Spanish I,"I am on the look out for more materials to challenge my Spanish 3 students. This is a great little booklet, but the Level 3 (I am assuming) refers to the third in line of this series, not for Spanish 3 Students. I'm glad I ordered it - it has a good review of verb conjugations, some simple translations, prepositions, and lots of little line drawings to make it interesting. I'm happy to see a little paragraph reading, some irregular verbs, clothing, weather, lots of good topics to practice a little at a time. I'm sure I'll come up with some sort of incentive to get my students from Spanish I to use this during the summer months to be sure they don't get rusty.If you're looking for Spanish 3 material - conversational, advanced Spanish, this isn't it.Hope this helps others! Good practice for simple basic Spanish, and a bit of grammar tossed in. - Oh, and an answer key in the middle!Sra. GoseMother, Teacher, AuthorFlip Flop Spanish Series"
5,Great Fun,"I purchase this item for my ""new"" grandchildren. We popped ""chestnuts on an open fire"", just like the old Christmas song. It was a great success."
3,Pretty good..,"This all-ages comic is relatively good. While it is not going to revolutionalise gothic-esque comic genre, it is better than Lenore and most others of its counterparts.While the manga-style art is just lovely, particularly the frames when Courtney enters the non-human/faery world, the plot is a little meandering and quite weak and basic at times. While I have not read the follow-up works, which may include this element, I would have like to see Courtney explore her own magic a little more. Additionally, there was minimal interaction between Courtney and her grandfather, and yet we are meant to imagine that they had become close allies.I did however feel that the character of Courtney was quite interesting and completely identifiable. Similarly, the parental characters were suitably ghastly and disinterested.This is a short but cute enough read. If only there were more comics examining the same topic of magic and childhood isolation, just slightly more adult and fleshed out."
3,Easily-corrected errors mar an otherwise fine book,"Ted Naifeh, Courtney Crumrin and the Night Things (Oni, 2002)A fun little tale about a girl whose parents drag her out to the very odd suburbs so the family can take care of ailing Uncle Aloysius, who doesn't seem to need taking care of at all. Courtney comes of age, and discovers her powers as a sorceress, under the tutelage of Uncle Al, coming up with inventive, and sometimes quite nasty, ways of fitting in at her new school. Very amusing stuff, this, and exceptionally dark (one wonders how much of this rubbed off on Holly Black; the more recent Spiderwick Chronicles bear more than a passing resemblance). Some rather odd typos (which one doesn't expect in hand-lettered work, to be sure) and a couple of non sequiturs that made me wonder if I was missing a page, but greatly enjoyable nonetheless. ***"
4,Fun Pink Cruiser,I ordered this bike for myself as my Mother's Day present. Hubby's present to me was to put it together. It only took him an hour or so. It is alot of fun to ride. I ordered the 17 inch because it was the only option. I wish I could have ordered the 19 inch since I'm 5'11 but so far it looks like it should work for me. It has been years since I've ridden a bike and I've already taken it for a spin around the block. The paint is awesome and it arrived on time with no damage. The price is a bit high but if it lasts...it is worth it. Hubby was impressed that it is a licensed GM product. Looking forward to riding with my nieces and nephews around the block and on the beach :) Terri
4,Unique view of Jesus' life and story,"I loved this DVD - the alternative representation of Jesus as a black man was unique and thought-provoking. The movies' portrayal was a good one - and it lets you know that racism was alive and well a long, long time ago. Quite the eye-opener - that Jesus would have been treated badly because of his color and not just his message. Makes you think...and it's rather sad that things still haven't changed much."
3,"Black Jesus your cup of tea? Good moral, but movie stresses race too heavily.","This story supposes that Jesus was black and positions him as a race martyr. While Jesus may have been of a dark race - such as Mesopotamian or other - it is made more important here than it needs to be. There are some good performances, while others are ridiculous and overwrought. 20th Century Fox cleaned up by buying this shortly after Mel Gibson's controversial and successful ""The Passion of the Christ"" and put it in select theaters and on DVD. Worth a look to see Debbi Morgan."
5,outstanding,"This movie was amazing, unforgettable!! The soundtrack is a large part of why. ""the wings"" makes me cry every time i hear it. It is such an emotional, beautiful story. This soundtrack is destined for Oscar status!"
5,THANK YOU STRAIGHT PEOPLE FOR THINKING OF US!,"It is a great movie, but not sure if it is because of the actual movie, or because this movie went mainstream. One big comment is that it is sad we have to resort to straight actors to make it mainstream, and then remove any intimacy from the film which futhers certain stereotypes. I don't mean porn style intimacy, but parts of the movie where a real gay couple snuggles, kisses, and behaves like any other couple. Instead, we get a one spit in the hand quasi-rape sceen that makes everyone (gay/straight/bi/trans/other) cringe. I wanted to take my mom to this movie, but the beating in the end just re-inforced what lots of mom's think that being gay results in being gay bashed."
3,Good Film -- bad soundtrack,"Great film, but the songs selected in the soundtrack could have been better. It seems to be a Willie Nelson meets Spaghetti Western Movie Music styles. It is typical background atmosphere music you readily forget as soon as you leave the theater. Buy the DVD of the film, but leave the soundtrack alone."
3,The music brings back memories of the film,"While I do not remember all of the songs being in the movie, much of the instrumental music evokes the beautiful scenery and the beautiful men. The song by Willie Nelson, ""He Was a Friend of Mine,"" is perfect for the film, and the song Emmy Lou Harris sings is nice, too. However, ""King of the Road"" and ""It's So Easy to Fall in Love"" would have been better left out. Rufus Wainwright and another male performer on the album are very good, as is the woman who sang in the movie at the dance Jack and his wife attended with another couple. If you loved the movie, you'll like this album."
5,Heartbreakingly Beautiful,"I have not yet seen the film, but if the music is any reflection, this film will haunt me after I do. The music is spare, elegant and clear. The list of artists who perform here are a select group of country masters. Should be remebered at Oscar time, both for the score and Best Song-either Willie Nelson's or Emmy Lou Harris' songs could be the winner. If you enjoyed this music don't miss the composer's other recent score ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" another affecting soundtrack that seemlessly matches another superb film.Highly reommended."
5,Great music for a great movie,"Well, being European I am not that familiar with country music, so I don't really like or not like it. But this music goes perfectly with the movie, especially the instrumental pieces writter by Mr. Santaolalla, in addition there are some really great songs, the best example ""Love that will never grow old"", beautifuly performed by Ms. Harris. The only song, where I didn't really feel comfortabe was ""It's so easy"". Don't get me wrong, it might be a great song on its own but somehow in my oppinion does not belong with the others. Great music with the movie or on its own."
1,snore...,"It is my opinion that the oscars were rigged. No one who listens to the instrumentals on this soundtrack along with the glorious music of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" or ""Pride and Prejudice"" can make any comparison, unless they have no musical background. It's like comparing the wailing of a hound dog to the strains of a Rachmaninoff masterpiece.Your money could be much better spent, unless you want to be lulled to sleep by monotonous music without a singable melody."
3,Anti-climactic,"After the excruciatingly detailed build-up on how the Portuguese, Dutch, and British competed for the spice trade in the 17th century, the role of Nathaniel Courthope, while decidedly and heroically British, seems trivial.Lots of foreshadowing about the grisly torture and merciless slaughter that unfolds after a couple of hundred pages... plenty of details of shipping routes.Not a horrible book, but also not worth the time it took to read it."
3,Too much history,"Very nice compendium of the English point of view about the birth of spice trading. I found it fascinating, but too many phrases from original documents make it a bit too boring, though vivid. I expected some more maps, or even pictures."
3,"If nothing else, read the Introduction","The introduction to this book is the best part. I burst out laughing right in the bookstore.The Carpet People is Pratchett's first published work but has been extensively rewritten since then. As he puts it, this is now ""a collaboration"" between the younger author and the older.I love Pratchett's Discworld series and the only reason I can't give this book more stars is because his other work sets the bar so high. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
4,Great quesitons,"This book has great questions and is a fantastic companion to the review book. Some quesions on this book are repeated in the review book and CD so beware. Otherwise, a great book that will help solidify your test taking techniques and fill in gaps in your knowledge base.That said, I really benefited from doing tons and tons of questions. I would get this book but also spend some extra cash on getting more questions and full length tests with answers/explanations and grading scales to really asess where you are.Good luck!"
1,Not worth the money,"We started with these knives, but quickly traded them in forJ.A. Henckels S.O.S. High Carbon Stainless Steel Steak Knives, Set of 4The Mansion knives just don't cut steak, while the S.O.S (aka: Zwilling J.A. Henckels) do a terrific job and look great!"
1,NOT AN AUTHORIZED RELEASE,PEACOCK FILMS is a rip-off artist. They never paid director David McCormick one cent for the video release of this film after 10 years of sales and they also illegally released this film on DVD after being sent a termination letter by the director years prior to the release. Although their original contract has now expired they have flooded the market with this cheaply done DVD.DO NOT SUPPORT THIS UNSCRUPULOUS COMPANY.Please note that this has nothing to do with the vendors who are selling the DVD on-line. They are unaware of the situation.
4,Nice!,"I have a membership at a gym, but sometimes I find it easier to do arm exercises at home. I have enjoyed having this resistance band, because I can use it while just sitting on the couch. The medium strength is perfect for me since I am only trying to tone up my arms and not add bulk. Great price, too!"
3,IT REALLY WORKS !!!!,"When I purchased this I was skeptical because the band is rather thin, but I found out that the band works in my fitness routine."
3,Disappointing,"I must say that Dorothy Whipple is an undeservedly neglected writer, and we must be grateful to Persephone Books for rescuing her from obscurity. That said, I enjoyed this much less than other books of hers such as 'They Were Sisters' and 'The Priory'. Characterisation is usually Whipple's strong point but here the characters are largely pasteboard, two-dimensional creatures: Ellen, the virtuous, betrayed wife, Avery, the weak, charming husband, Louise, the calculating femme fatale. The two teenage children too, are amusingly free of adolescent vices. Nevertheless, one reads on, wanting to know how all fare in the end. However, for a book with a similar theme, but infinitely more subtle and nuanced, I would suggest Elizabeth Jenkins' The Tortoise and the Hare', an acutely perceptive, beautifully observed and exquisitely written book on a disintegrating marriage."
5,Macdrive 7,"Pretty simple said...the product works.I have used this product since its first inception, v1. I owned a graphics studio and professional commercial print shop, and I use this product to transfer data back and forth between PC and Mac.Back then there was nothing else...and now after all these years, it still is seemless"
1,Dumb and Sickening Piece of Trash,"I truly feel sorry for the author's children----this little piece of junk is ignorant, ignorant, ignorant--ignorant of history, ignorant of religions, ignorant of the world! Sad."
4,This straight to video film deserved a lot more!,"I rented this film (and then later bought the DVD) with fairly low expectations. I knew it was straight to video and low budget. I rented it because I am a huge Michael Wincott fan and he actually has a starring role in the film. Basically, there is a whole lot more to this film than you would think. It's about redemption, honor, deception, love, friendship, and the ability to make the right decisions and gambles to change your life, all tied together.... I thought Michael Wincott was brilliant in it (Diane Lane and William Peterson were also solid). I can't talk about my favorite scenes without giving away the end, but when his character, Frankie, sees what is happening, you see the realization on his face and it is heartbreaking. He rocks thru the end of the film. I felt his performance was extremely underrated - I'd never even heard of this film. Check it out."
1,Bad disc ruins movie,Amazon is the 3rd vendor I have tried to buy this movie from and all copies I got including the one from Amazon were bad. Something seriously was wrong and the disc wouldn't play at all in DVD player or on my computer.
5,Gunshy is great!,"This movie has it all...as far as I'm concerned: Great story, great acting and great location.Petersen is, as usual captivating on screen, Diane Lane is beautiful and talented and Michael Wincott...wow, what a character creation.I think you'll enjoy it, I know I did!"
5,Good Movie,This is one of those stories that I guess could actually happen to someone that is at a low point in their life. Well acted by the cast. William Petersen makes his character come alive and with his hesitations becomes real. By the end of the film you want him to have what he seaks but also want him to be safe. I would recommend this and did share it with friends.
1,Waste of time,"Very disappointing. Purchased the VHS video & CD ""Box Set"" edition. The music CD was very good, but the VHS tape was almost totally worthless. If you are looking for an introduction to Western (Swedish) massage, please pass this title by. Over 90% of the tape deals with Eastern massage styles and give only fundamentals without any coherent order. Not appropriate to help prepare you to give a massage."
3,Bachman-Turner Overdrive - 'King Biscuit Flower Hour' (King Flower),"Show took place on March 8, 1974 in Chicago. I vaguely remember this tour, when they had Styx as opener. This live archive King Biscuit recording is okay and all - I mean I liked hearing their staples like ""Let It Ride"", ""Roll On Down The Highway"", their smash hit ""Takin' Care Of Business"" and the timeless ""You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet"" - but this live concert is WAY too flipping short! I mean - come on! Just seven songs? I saw them awhile back open for Van Halen's '5150' tour and I'm sure they played at least this long, just as a support band. The thirty-minute interview with Randy Bachman is okay. Pretty much aimed toward the die-hard fans. Sound quality is good."
2,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this drive. The hardware itself is great, it matched my expectations. However I am very disappointed and angry that the burning software that is bundled with the drive is only A 30 DAY TRIAL VERSION. WHAT KIND OF GAME ARE YOU PLAYING?????????"
1,Poor Support from Lite-On For Problem with this Drive,"I easily installed this dvd drive in my Dell PC, but when I went to play a DVD the sound was distorted. It played music CD's fine, but the DVD sound was bad. So I went on Lite-On's website for a live chat with a customer support representative. The support rep responded quickly to my question and suggested that I needed a dvd codec. He told me to go to Cyberlink's wbsite and download PowerDVD. In other words, he was telling me to pay more money than the drive cost to be able to properly play DVD's on it. I asked him why they didn't include PowerDVD with the drive, but he couldn't answer me. I am returning the drive to Amazon for a refund and getting another one - and it won't be a Lite-On."
4,"David Pyatt, horn","David Pyatt is an excellent player, depending on your conception of the instrument. He plays with the traditional ""American"" sound, i.e., without vibrato. All of the pieces were composed for horn and piano (no transcriptions). This CD is an excellent addition to any serious horn player's library."
2,Just another bad Gary Daniels movie,"Gary Daniels plays a bounty hunter in a futuristic world similiar toThe Road Warrior. His brother in-law's sister is pregnant and her baby has an anti-virus that can help save the world. A guy named Little Ray (Bryan Genesse) wants the woman for himself because he is a bad guy.I can't even describe how horrible this movie is. Gary Daniels is basically playing Isaac Florentine's version of Mad Max. There is a lot of mindless talk and no real story, and a Gary Daniels fight thrown in every 10-15 minutes. The action is not bad, certainly a lot better thanFatal Blade, but it is hard to get into a fight when there is no point to it. Even when they could have had a really cool finale, ther is no creativity involved. The 2 guys just go up in the air and kick eachother like it is a kung fu movie from 1971. I made it all the way through this, but it was very hard. Highly not recommended.1.5/5The DVD from Image Entertainment has good sound and very good picture quality."
5,Great and fun to watch,These are fun to watch when it rains and look a lot better than downspouts at all times.
5,A Must for Every Blues Fan,"As raw, as earthy, as real as the blues can get. If you like blues, you need to hear this recording."
5,Excellent burner!!,"I am using this writer for the past 6 months. I never found a single problem with this writer. I have written many home and backup dvds. The burn process was always successful. For writing 4.7gb with a 4x dvd-r or +r it will just take 12 minutes. For a cd-r or +r it will hardly take 2 minutes. Although it is a little pricey, I am totally satisfied with the accuracy. It is better to put some extra bucks on the writer than wasting time on scrapping your expensive blank dvds."
2,Just OK,I've had this unit for a very long time.There have been times that it did not work and then all of a sudden it starts working again.One big drawback - it will not work with (+) disks.
4,Battlestations Midway,"Battlestations MidwayI am, without a doubt, a WWII combat game addict! This little piece of work is not at all bad for the occasional battle fan, however; it takes more than a little getting used to in order to play it well!I figured this more for a load and play fun game. Not so, with many different ships, planes, ground troops, etc. each area has to be learned from the ground up.Fairly good graphics, cool water images, reasonable ship and plane rendering.Over all, if you are willing to spend a fair amount of time learning the ins and outs, I'm sure you will enjoy this game."
2,"Reasonable Sound, Bad Quality","Even though this speakers don't sound awful, the only rating that I feel is appropriate is 2 stars --- the speakers are not durable, the piece of plastic that contains the radio dial came off mine.The LCD clock sounds like a cute idea, but I would guess most people use these speakers next to a computer, which usually displays a clock already. The radio reception is not very good indoors (as could be expected), which makes all the extras these speakers seem to offer rather useless.I've tried several cheap computer speakers, and these are definitely not among the better ones. For good cheap computer speakers check out the Creative SBS260 Speakers (ASIN B0002V9IKK). The sound quality of these is amazing considering the price."
3,Smaller than expected,Clips were suppose to fit all size rollers. Clips don't fit jumbo rollers. Would not have bought if I knew this in advance.
4,Wonderful Old Folk CD,"This CD was a gift from an old girlfriend of mine and is a particular favorite. It is very raw and I think it gives an idea of what the folk music coffeehouses of the 60s sounded like before Bob Dylan went electric. Very much an understated set of music though unfortunately some of the tunes are in a way dated because the topics are forgotten news stories. Nonetheless, a very enjoyable CD which is unlike anything else in my collection."
4,Ian Hunter The Secret Sessions,"Great CD. Ian Hunter et.al. The ideo clip of ""the outsider"" is grainy but fantastic! That clip is worth the price of the cd."
4,Awesome industrial dance,"Do you ever get in one of those moods where you just want to thrash around, dance and headbang all at once? For me, there was a time when KMFDM was the band for those moods, but I got tired of the guitars... Enter Blank. Davide's monotonous, heavily processed vocals hearken to Skinny Puppy, but when layered over Ricardo's high-bpm four-on-the-floor beats and driving techno hits provide the perfect soundtrack for intense dancing, running or just working out frustrations. This is a CD that any fan of Euro dance or industrial music should own."
1,Its too rough,"I bought this for my daugther when she was a newborn and never used it cause it is way too rough for babies skin. She's 2 now and not into winnie the pooh at all, she's more of a Dora and Wonder Pets type of gal, so it was just a huge waste of money."
3,An Archive of Tuvan Melodies,"This CD was one of the first to feature the unique musical tradition of Tuva. This CD was recorded in the yurts and natural areas of Tuva, so sometimes the sound quality isn't top notch. This is also more like a sampler. None of the tracks are very long and it moves through the different styles of throatsinging and melodies very fast. It does feature some of the revered masters of the styles though. I think this would be a good introductory disc to throatsinging, so a person can find what they like."
3,Clear body for RC18T,Typical polycarbonate clear body to trim out and paintOne somewhat minor disappointment though- there is no over-spray film on this body as is typical with most other clear bodies that you purchase. Not a real big deal- you just have to spend a little more time masking the outside edges to avoid overspray.Still a good fit in the associated RC18T and a reasonable price for a clear body.
3,Blender Blues,"The price was great and the glass jar is heavy...but the lid does not fit properly and is made of some cheesy rubber. Functions well, but the ill fitting lid takes away from any quality usage."
2,SO/SO PRODUCT,"My boyfriend set up the bed in the living room, when it was all set we moved it to the bedroom. The next day I noticed the screw that holds up the side so the baby would'nt fall had fell out. I tried screwing it back in but it would not stay. We ended up putting that side against the wall. I was really disappointed with this product."
2,I returned this bed,This bed looked so cute when I bought it! The items in the box did not match the instructional diagrams. Not only that but the screws didn't all fit. It was so annoying when I started to put it together that I took it apart and returned it. I'm buying a StorkCraft wooden bed for my son now.
2,Booo,"This book is disappointing and concerning. This was a wasted opportunity for the author to set a good example for young adults. By allowing the characters to show some emotional maturity while dealing with the hormone induced teenage lust, the author could have added some depth to the story. Instead they had perfect (and unrealistic) sex, days after meeting...at school. Entire chapters are dedicated to mundane daily tasks with some noteworthy prose stuck in randomly. Lacking in action, intrigue and realism, this book was a waste of a good idea."
1,"Interesting idea and well written, but conscientious parents need to know . . .","This book is riddled with lust and sex. It is not just mentioned as an aside. It is throughout the book, culminating in the main characters having sex repeatedly. I am about two thirds of the way though the book, but I am not even going to finish it. I feel, as an adult, the content matter is not something I really want to read about. I am horrified this book is marketed to young adults, though I am no longer surprised."
3,A Certain Slant of Light,"A good book for a young adult or an interesting light read for an adult. Unfortunately, I picked this up at a popular bookstore because it was advertised for teenagers. I bought it for my sixteen year old daughter thinking that it would be appropriate. The B&N bookstore should not have labeled it ""Teenagers"" since the first time our heroine gets in a body she skips her class and has sex with her boyfriend in the auditorium..Great!!Just what I wanted my daughter exposed to....oh well. I liked it but not for her...Thanks."
3,"A Sad, Sad Story","This book is aimed at the young adult group because it focuses on the lives of two teens, but seeing as Helen has been a ghost for 130 years, the teen view is skewed. The story is much more mature as it is seen through the eyes of an adult masquerading as a teenager in a time that isn't her own.Looking at the different types of families one can be raised in is painful the way that Whitcomb writes it. Helen is part of a very religious family with it's own secrets hiding within and she pushes them to the surface to be dealt with. Most difficulties come from Helen struggling to do the right thing and try to please her family while at the same time she must try to be with her true love.There is little happiness to this story, which would be the biggest downfall, it doesn't make you feel good reading it, even though there are some good events within the story. The most wonderful part of the story is that it reminds me of Romeo & Juliet, if Romeo & Juliet were ghosts."
2,Spectral slant on teen romance,"Twice shy of werewolves ? Dried up on vampires ? Have you tried lost (literally lost, abandoned) soul teenage hunks ? The twist here is a unique solution to the lack of a corporeal body problem presented by the material world we live in. Let's face it, to enjoy getting all hot and bothered you need to actually sweat. The solution here will strike some readers (mostly adults) as too convenient, but may pass muster with a very young person. So-so stuff."
3,"Nothing to do with ""Paradise Garage""","The depiction of NYC's legendary ""Paradise Garage"" nightclub on the cover of this CD set is a misleading marketing trick. The music here, mostly from the mid-90s, has nothing to do with Larry Levan or the Paradise Garage that closed in 1988.The U.K. term ""garage music"" does not refer directly to the music associated with Larry Levan or the Paradise Garage nightclub. There are several very fine compilations which document the music of Paradise Garage. If that is what you are looking for, pass this set by don't be deceived by the photo on the cover."
2,Itchy and does not wash well,I expected the blanket to be a lot softer then it is. My new born still sleeps on it so I gave it at least 2 stars. I washed it and combed it out and by the time I was done the blanket looked like it was many years old not to mention it took over an hour to comb. Not worth the price. My sister has same type of blanket and it is much softer. I will try a different brand next time.
2,disappointing,"I thought I was getting a book that would tell about the lives, in general, of Liverpool seamen. Instead it is a very detailed history of social welfare initiatives to help the men and their families. If that is what one wants to read about, then this book is for them. The very broad title of the book is misleading, and even the jacket blurb does not give the impression that the information is going to be so heavily slanted toward the history of organizations for seamen. I was highly disappointed in the subject matter of this book. Seems like it should have had a subtitle to more clearly define its scope."
3,The case of the missing deodorant...,This shaver chews up my armpits so badly I can't wear deodorant. I give it a three because it does do a pretty good job on the legs.Given the results I probably will investigate shaver comparisons to find a better one for sensitive skin.
1,In my opinon Junk,"We have few of these scanners. They are continuously jamming and we have had to replace the feeders on some of them. Cheaply built, I would not recommend these scanners. We have alot better luck with Canon scanners."
4,A good read if you're a fan of Dostoevsky's other works....,"The plot wasn't particularly attention grabbing; however, the stories that are spun by Kolya's father are fantastic. I also like the feel you get of the Russian culture in each of Dostoevsky's books, and this book is no exception. I found it interesting that Dostoevsky suffered from epilepsy, just like the Prince. The idea that ""those kind"" are particularly loved by God is a relief in an age where ""those kind"" are avoided like the plague. Overall, it is the least favorite of the three novels I've read by this author; however, it is still worthy to be called a Classic."
2,not a fan,"well, i've used it three or four times. then i bought a different razor. couldn't get a smooth shave, and how in the world it cuts my skin without cutting the hair above it i really don't know, but it managed it."
3,i thought by other reviews it would be a good shaver but..,I bought this shaver hoping for a good alternative to the razor but it did not perform as I wanted. It takes several passess to get the hair and then sometimes leaves patches behind. It was not worth the money I spent and wished I had never bought it.
2,"Say what, you guys?","Who's writing all the reviews of this album? I have a feeling at least a couple of them are written by the band. That's the only way to explain it. This album is not good. Are you kidding me? Why listen to this when there is SO MUCH music out there that blows this out of the water? Listen, for what you have to pay for this mediocre CD, you can go out there and get two Megadeth or Judas Priest or Motorhead CDs. So just do that. Pass this one by. You won't miss it."
4,dumbass prices from the store,"I bought a copy on Ebay for $40 inclusing shipping. It's an awesome album. I see there are a couple of morons selling it for $250 and $500. Cripes, they aren't that good to dish out that kind of cash. I feel sorry for the sucker who does buy it for that price.Anyways, great album for me being from Montreal like the band themselves, but I want to spit on my palm and slap the guy who's selling it for $500."
3,Slow Beginning,"It took me a couple of days to get into this book. Once I did I found the chapters easy to digest and before I knew it I was hurrying to finish this book. Very light read, I liked the characters, but I wouldn't say I was very invested in them."
3,An Average Read...,"This book was a quick read and I was pleased with it for the most part, but it certainly wasn't anything special in the chick lit world. The ending was different than what I expected and seemed a lot more emotional than the rest of the book. I wish the whole book had been as emotional...it would have made for a much more interesting and gripping read! The character of Betsy's mother cracked me up and was my favorite by far even though she didn't play as large of a role in the plot as I think she could have. Overall, I'd recommend this title to anyone looking for a light read. There is a touch of mystery mixed with various relationships and life decisions. I would borrow this one from a library or purchase it used if you can find a good deal, but it's not a book that I can recommend paying full price for."
3,still has problems with Firefox,"I have used version 6 for over a year and just tried this version 8 to see if the bugs that bothered me in v6 had been fixed.They have not.An important case in point is the photo-album tool. It creates code that works fine with Internet Explorer, but not with Firefox. Thumbnail table of pictures is fine, but when you click on one to bring it up for view, it gives the following error in Firefox:Firefox can't find the file at /C:/Documents and Settings/Me/My Documents/WebPages/PhotoAlbum1/%7.I generally like the program (as an experienced computer user, but one who only creates web pages occasionally and doesn't want a more powerful tool), but if they can't make it work with Firefox as well as IE, I may have to go elsewhere...Word of advise - download their trial version, ceate some web pages, and then try using IE and Firefox to view them before buying the full product..."
3,Just ok,"Thought this version of Namo has some user flaws. Highlighted scrolling is WAY to fast, and makes it impossible to copy anything by highlighting with a mouse if it is not already on the screen. Don't know if there are options to change it, if there is I haven't found it. Undo doesn't work after a copy of the HTML has been saved - very annoying. Still works for what I need though."
1,Wrong item,I ordered this toy box and they sent me the wrong thing. I called customer service and they sent me a replacement and it was still the wrong thing. I asked them why it showed one thing one the interent but shipped something different and all they could tell me was that Amazon had the wrong item listed for that part number. To me it was to much of a hassle to send both of them back. In turn I ordered it from Walmart.com and got it in three days and in perfect condition.
3,"Good on substance, lacking in style","I can't comment on the scholarship of this book, but sytlistically, it clearly was missing a strong editor! Topic sentences are non-existent, leading me to have to re-read pages over and over.... Also, I was disappointed by the lack of information about any substantive area of history that doesn't interest the author (for example, Christianity's treatment of Jews, or scientific advances). In sum, I would have gotten much more out of a focus on ""society"" than ""state."""
2,Hoped for better,"Trims well in detail places without guide.Does poorly with uneven cut on heavy beard.Tines on guide are wide, tend to push beard down instead of combing through.Will not make a heavy cut.OK for travel kit."
1,Wont buy it again,"The product does not work. When you turn on the tooth brush the brush head twists off. This is bad design for the product. It starts to brush, the brushes move, but the brush head twists off the toothbrush with the vibration of the toothbrush."
4,Preschool Class,"I currently have this toy in my preschool classroom. The age of the children range from 2.9 to 5 years. They all absolutely love the spooky theme for Halloween. After a few lessons from the older children the younger ones have figured out the pattern of movements to be done before the car can roll all the way down.I have to be honest, I paid nothing for the toy, I found it at my local dump! Not sure if the previous owner hated it but we are truely enjoying it!"
3,Fun except when the Van is Stuck,"Like others, I bought this toy b/c it resembles the Mystery Machine and my child loves Scooby & haunted houses. A great design overall with cute action & sounds...BUT almost every time the van goes through one of the turns, it gets lodged inside. You have to get it out with a hand or shake the toy to get it rolling again. If it didn't have the one catching place, it would go smoothly. This had an initial great 'wow' factor and my child was most excited opening it out of all their Christmas gifts, but soon tired of the van constantly getting stuck inside."
5,A very good read.,"I had never heard of the author previously, but someone handed this book to me to read and it showed many of the troubling legal issues arising from the Patriot Act from someone that seems to actually have a knowledgeable background in the field of law and the Patriot Act.It is written from a bit of a liberal slant, but captures much of what is good from the left political spectrum view and capsulizes it in a character (perhaps a lawyer based on Terry Olsen's own legal background?) trying to navigate through the legal problems created by the Patriot Act in defense of his client.I find Olsen's style of writing to make this book an enjoyable read as well: Creative, entertaining and very insightful as far as the human aspect of his characters and the story."
5,Building Blocks,"This book is fantastic! Step by step detail of training tips for a puppy,then repeats to make sure you understand. The pictures illustrate manytechniques. She trains you just as you should train your dog.I use this as a text book or manual - read, re-read, highlight items, writenotes in margin."
1,Not Written by Stephen Hawking,"Just to remind people of what has already been said, this book was NOT written by Stephen Hawking and should be avoided!"
5,"Finally, beautiful music with energy!","I have worn out this CD about 5 times already! It's beautiful, mystical, energetic, and truly inspiring. Anyone who has an ear for really quality music will appreciate this. A haven of joy to anyone who has been previously disappointed with instrumental music!"
5,Best Flip Flops Ever - BUY THEM,"I had been told about these by my family and friends for awhile and finally decided to give them a shot and I am so glad I did. They are without question the best pair of flip flops I have ever owned. The traction is great, they are well made and they NEVER ever stink no matter what. I love how comfortable they are and look forward to buying several more pairs when summer approaches next year. BUY THESE SANDALS!!!"
3,Quality not like it used to be,I have 2 other pairs of Havaianas and these new ones just don't seem to be made quite the same way. The straps are twisted at an odd angle so they don't lie flat against the foot and they're wider-set than the older ones. Maybe just a glitch?
4,Unique and very beautiful,"Sharing the same characteristic resonant- nasal sounding intonations of vocal group `La Voix Bulgare', this rendition of Palestrina is particularly tasteful and well-developed. It is performed and sung in an Medieval Russo-Eastern European style with reminiscent Mediterranean influences.Palestrina performed in a manner unlike any Palestrina recording you've probably ever heard - a highly unique and original setting."
1,1999? I DON'T THINK SO!,"We were looking for an up-to-date video about massage and this looked up-to-date! Well, not so. It must have been filmed in the early 70's. Also, they spend very little time showing massage techniques and more time showing diagrams. Then to finish it off they have a full 13 minutes of the 70's couple fully naked. May have been good but I couldn't get by the bearded ""peace"" man. Gag! Get something up-to-date so you can at least watch it without having to throw-up!"
3,It is Okay,"The quality is okay. It probably is a little over priced fro what it is, but it did the job."
1,Mac version does not work,"Dont buy this for mac. Game first started o.k. then froze up, then the product code was no good. No tech support."
1,bad,bad book don't make any other books please don't please don't dude just don't I hated this book! please just don't
1,Horrid,This book is the biggest pile of excrement ever written. It is also full of cryptic run on sentences that waste paper and ink. This book should not be allowed.
2,Pitiful,"A book only for the most committed scholar of William Pitt's political life. Written in an arid style, Professor Turner's book neglects the broader context. The general reader is offered no feel of the interesting times in European history within which Pitt the Younger operated."
4,"A delightful book to dip into, and a great gift!","I enjoyed ""visiting with"" Mrs. Whaley again, although perhaps not as much as in her gardening book. When reading, you feel as if you are sitting in front of her, engaged in listening to stories about Charleston, her past, and her family, and about making guests feel at home. I don't think the recipes will take the world by storm--most are variations on old favorites. But you pick up tidbits about entertaining and the relaxed southern style. This book and/or her gardening book would make wonderful gifts, and would be perfect to tuck into a gift basket along with some other items. It is the kind of book you want to pick up when you've had a hard day or have a rainy afternoon to enjoy!"
3,The Art of Deception,"The Air Sterilizer seems to be working well, but I have an issue with the company that sold and shipped it to me.This item was advertised as being ""NEW"", and that it why I purchased it, but when it was delivered, it was not in a Factory Sealed Box, there was No Instruction Book included, No warranty Paperwork, and it was very poorly packaged.This was the first and last time that I will buy something through Amazon.com.The vendor, in this case, has deceived Amazon and me. I just don't think that I could put my trust in Amazon, as the ""Middleman"", in future transactions."
5,"watch it, it is great","absolutely the best crime drama on tv worldwide.None of the characters are likeable, all seem ready to go to bed with whomever- whenever, but areobsessed with doing their job and doing it well."
5,"Fundamental of death metal, do not miss","A roaring onslaught of streaming sound, this album moves away from the choppy, explosive riffing which emphasized guitar as percussion instrument. Instead, texture and shape are emphasized in highly relativistic phrases which narrate the development of themes like a classical pop piece. Unholy bass-heavy vocals merge with detuned distorted guitar and deathlike prowling bass, creating a peristaltic wash of sonic attack that is irresitably violent and well-composed. Of the many early death metal releases, this one stands the test of time."
1,Too expensive,"At first I was very excited to get this toy as a Christmas gift for my Grandson, however when he opened the package he was so excited to get the weed timmer and while Daddy took it out of the box it fell apart. Needless to say he was so disappointed as was I. I did e-mail Amazon who notified the company and I received a replacement in less than 24 hours. While I was waiting on the replacement from the company I found the exact same toy on line from Toys R Us for $30.00 less than I paid for it. But the worse thing is that the company I received it from was ""Toys R Us"", talk about rip off. I don't believe that I will order any more toys from this company, even though they replaced it in a timely mannor."
3,Beach Book,"This was a fun little book that will give you an easy summer read. Jemima Jones, overweight and dateless, takes on the perils of an internet romance, which changes her life and leads her to true love. I loved the way that Jane Green kept changing the narrative voice. It was a little disconcerting at first, but it was a refreshingly unique approach that kept the pace of the book moving at an upbeat tempo. Of course, as any summer beach book must, this book has a happy, if somewhat unrealistic ending. I'd recommend picking this one up and tossing it in your beach bag!"
1,A lame Cinderella story,"I plodded through this book in the hopes that it would eventually become interesting. It never did. The author tries to knock-off ""Bridget Jones,"" but the title character, Jemima J, never develops enough charm to make her somebody you'd want to root for. In fact, she's a rather dull and very unrealistic character...the woman lacks basic common sense, yet the author wants us to believe she's above average intelligence. Nothing about the story makes sense, and it's far too unexciting to ever be considered a fairy tale."
3,Good,"This is book was really cute, but I kind of felt like I was being pulled in 10 different directions through out it. Bookends was better, but if you like that then you probably be happy with Jemima J."
1,book gives a horrible message,"I have to admit-I almost couldn't put this book down. I felt that I identified with the ""first Jemima""-that is the heavy one. But I really resented the fact that as soon as Jemima lost weight, Ben-the love of her life, became interested in her. This can really make women feel that weight is everything. It doesn't teach you that being thin will not always make you happy. I resent that. The book would have been so much more realistic if Ben didn't like her despite her losing weight. Coming from someone with an eating disorder, this book can really encourage a girl to stay or become anorexic or bulimic..."
3,For my first Jane Green Novel it's OK!,"I, too, was a little sad in the beginning. Being an overweight JJ, I so wanted her to embrace her curviness. I enjoyed her relationship with Brad, but thought the reason it ended was silly and unrealistic, unless people are really that superficial. I wouldn't know. I have learnt to love my curves however JJ has motivated me to become healthy and not obsessed."
2,"oops, again??","first, when i read this book, i found myself in this book.jemima j was quite similar.. no, she was just same with me.i expected some curvy or over weighted girls(women, anyway) to be proud of their own selves at the end of this story.but, oh gosh, it's again..why do those writers always think ONLY slim, well, SKINNY women can make men's knee to be weak??jemima takes some serious diet, she is eventually being skinny.i'm so exhausted by this kinda story. really enough!"
5,Best Jane Green Novel,"I have read many of jane green books with my first book being babyville, Straight Talking & others... Jane Green books really didn`t account as great books but its kind of entertaining... But for Jemima J, which I had read about a year ago & still leaves a very deep impression for me, Ms Green scored it! I was so captivated by Jemima and her obession of being skinny that I found myself laughing out loud & cheering for Jemima many a times. The ending was believable too which I`m sure will be inspiring for all. I hope Ms Green will continue to produce works having the same brillance of Jemima J... A GEM! I Love it!"
5,I couldn't put it down!,"It was amazing how much I related to Jamima! It was like reading about my self! It was had a great flow and wonderful asides... I loved it! I would highly reccommend it to anyone who has struggled with their weight, crushed on someone you thought you could never have, and found that it didn't matter what happened to you in the end you were still a beautiful person."
3,"Entertaining, but not her best work","A good book, but not Jane Green's best work. The story is entertaining, but predictable. Still, it's a good book for curling up with on a rainy day."
4,fun but unrealistic,"This book was a quick and easy read. It is charming and makes the reader gain empathy for the main character Jemima J. I liked the book, however, I think it was unrealistic the way JJ lost all the weight; how she just changed to drastically. If you are a big girl you are not suddenly going to have the energy to become a gym rat and begin eating in a completely different manner. Also, the scenes in LA were a bit unrealistic as well. I live near LA/Beach and most of her depictions were stereotypical. She gave an image of what people think it is like here. Overall, I would recommend the book if you do not want a serious book. It offers a nice twist, but it ultimately proved to be pretty predictable. It was good, not great. Instead, read Good in Bed it is a GREAT book!"
2,silly,This book was silly & unrealistic. It was an easy read & entertaining enough to read all the way through but that isn't saying much since I hardly ever decide not to finish a book. I doubt Jane Green has ever been in a book store in LA since she thinks the chain book stores sell nothing but books on the film industry.
2,"Cute, but...very odd","This book is very readable, but at time to time it reads very srangely. Its told in first person, then third person, and some of the plot left a yukky taste in my mouth,and was quite disbelieving. It's quite a sophomore effort from Jane Green, and lets hope with more writing practice she gets better."
4,Great chic lit -- Why all the bad press?!!,"I had a tough time putting this book down which is why I don't understand all the bad press! I thought it was absolutely delightful and left me with warm and fuzzy feelings. It's definitely cinderella-esque but in a much more modernized way. Jane Green keeps you on your toes -- she offers the best climaxes! She guides you through fate and how it can affect all of us. I just loved this book, almost more so than her other book, ""Mr. Maybe.""It's a quick read too so go and decide for yourself. Cheers!"
3,"No depth, but would be a great beach book...","If you are strictly looking for an entertaining read, Jemima J fits the bill. The writing is tight and witty without being overtly cheesy or dramatic, and an author with less talent could have turned this story into a boring Jackie Collins-type rehash. Issues of weight and body image are addressed, and the author uses the familiar ugly-ducking-to-swan theme, but adds twists within the plot to keep the story interesting. During my reading, Wally Lamb's wonderful book She's Come Undone kept coming to mind; if you want a story that documents an overweight girl's transformation with more depth and more believeable characters...but for what it's worth, Jemima J is fun to read."
1,Horribly written,"I didn't think the plot was very well developed, and I didn't particularly buy into the assumptions underlying the story, but all would have been forgiven if the novel had been witty and well executed. Very disappointing!"
2,I Couldn't Even Finish It!,"Being that I could not force myself to waste another minute of my life and finish Jemima Jones, I might not be the best reviewer. Once I decided to quit reading it, I felt myself being shallowly pulled towards it. Though, when I considered the completely unrealistic plot and annoying tense shifts, the pulls weakened. The character transformation of Jemima Jones was laughable. A woman who could never control her eating habits suddenly becomes practically anorexic in the name of an online love! It would take a little more motivation than that to completely reverse all your bad habits and food mentality. Don't waste your time on this book. I suggest ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" and ""Bridget Jones': The Edge of Reason."" They are so much better than this fairy tale!"
3,Not all it is cracked up to be.....,"The book started out great-I thought I was in for another ""Marian Keyes"" type adventure. Quickly enough though it turned into a sappy Cinderella story. It just became so unbelievable that I could barely finish it. Sadly, Jane Green seems to have watched too many Baywatch episodes."
4,Gotta Love Her,"Jemima J is full of characters that I love to hate and hate to love. The characters were written about in a way that made me feel like I was walking down a street in London with them. While Jemima's drastic weight loss was hard to believe, the story stayed true to its characters. Jemima's character showed the readers that no although she was thin, things werent as perfect as she always expected they would be. Although the book seemed to have an awkward writing style, I found myself totally engrossed in her life and couldnt wait to turn the page to see what would happen next. A great brit girl novel!"
4,A Great Light Read...,"I found myself really enjoying this book. The main character, Jemima, is both depressing, yet inspiring. I found myself entrenched in her life, making it difficult for me to put the book down. It is a very light read, and teaches us how we all can transform ourselves into what we want to become. I would definitely recommend this book to a person who is looking for a light, entertaining read."
4,like looking in the mirror,"This is the first book I have read by Jane Green. I hadn't heard much about it, but it was recommended by a store employee where I purchased it. I really enjoyed this novel because I could honestly relate to Jemima Jones. I know what it is like to be overweight and overlooked or stared upon and I loved how she one day woke up and decided that she wasn't going to be fat anymore. Although I didn't appreciate her motives for her sudden weightloss-fetish (a guy), I still thought it held a lot of motivation. Overall this was a great feel-good novel and for anyone who wants to feel what it's like to be someone else, Jane Green is the author to help you. The one complaint I have is that the narration was a little awkward. Overall, it's still a great book to read!"
2,Little Substance but Light Entertainment,"The well known drama for a woman, Jemima J. is overweight and insecure, and has a crush on a co-worker who is ""out of her league."" In a miraculously unrealistic amount of time, Jemima begins a quest to make herself over. The rest of the novel is about her conquests and experiences in her journey to create the new Jemima and try to get her man. The writing style is very elementary and there isn't a lot of substance here, but it is a perfect beach read-and has it's entertaining moments."
4,Deliciously entertaining!,"Reading this book is like eating a wonderful rich chocolate cake and enjoying it guilt free. I honestly couldn't put this book down. I found it to be wonderfully written, funny, and easy to read. If you are looking for something light and easy to read, this is the novel for you. What I love most about Jemima J is that it doesn't take itself seriously. This is not a politically correct book about how ""fat"" women should be, look, act ... this isn't some self-help guidebook for women who wants to be thin. It's just a light, funny story told to entertain and amuse. It does however have a message to give to its reader. And it is simply to believe in ourselves and embrace our flaws."
4,Just enjoy the ride!,"Had to write a review because everyone I know is hatin' on the book. It was fun fun fun! I can totally relate to the character and even though you have to suspend reality time to time in order to accept what is happening- IT IS FICTION FOLKS- it is suppose to be fun in that way. It is really little more than a cinderella story, but hey, it is light and frothy and has way less calories than chocolate!"
1,Love Jane Green but didn't love this book,Love Jane Green's other books - hated this one. Had heard it wasn't good but downloaded it anyway as have never gone wrong with a JG book. Don't go there. Full of outdated technology & references and unpleasant and stupid characters. Sorry Jane but wasn't good at all.
4,"A Guilty Pleasure...Unrealistic, but who cares?!","Ever tried in vain to change yourself to meet your own standards of beauty only to find out that you may have been liked better just the way you were?That's what our plump heroine finds out after undergoing a Cinderella-style transformation after meeting the man of her dreams in an online chat room. She doctors a picture and sends it to her online flame only to realize what she's done...and then resolves to actually LOOK like the picture she's sent.Hey, I'm a skinny girl and I loved this book! It's pure FUN and I can't understand why some take it so seriously. At any size, any woman can appreciate what Jemima is going through and let's admit it...unrealistic as it is - we ALL love a Cinderella story!After reading this, I felt like I knew Jemima...in fact, I wanted to hang out with her. The story line is ridiculous, it would never happen, but hey...let your mind wander a little and follow Jemima on a fun journey through self discovery and back again."
5,Great chick lit,"I read mystery novels for a few weeks and decided that I wanted to read a chick lit book - in steps Jane Green. I had heard many good things about her as an author, and have been following her on Twitter, so I looked around for a book recommended by many people - I found that Jemima J seemed to be mentioned most. It took me a chapter or two to get into Jane Green's style of writing (she uses commas a lot more than I'm used to, interestingly enough), but after that I got interested in the story. After the basic plot was revealed, I had a hard time believing it, but I was far enough in that I had some attachment to Jemima, the main character. The end events turned my thoughts more positive about the entire book, because everything didn't end up exactly like I expected it to. I liked it enough to pick up another Jane Green book at the library, and am glad I have several more Green books available to read."
3,Like it or Not,"The truth is we are a society that is fixated on weight. The way JJ thought of herself or better yet did not think of herself (even after her makeover) serves as a reminder of how painful and almost debilitating it can be. My book club chose to read this selection this month and I started off generally enjoying the book and not wanting to put it down. But the ending was so cliched and kinda off putting. I mean really girls need to start thinking more about themselves than to take someone who would not give you the time of day (even when they connect in the more real ways) simply because of their outer appearance. But of course I am being naive to think we could live this way, I know I know. Still and all, it was a fun read just kinda anticlimatic!!"
2,Too long~~,"This book is tooooo longgg. THe author added a lot of useless descriptive details in this novel.That part with Brad and Jenny is really disgusting....shouldnt even include in the story.there's no point~Why only skin and fit people can find love, but not the fat ones?A lot of misleading points in this JJ novel."
4,Every Woman Can Relate to Jemima,"Jemima Jones is the average girl - she wants to be thin and beautiful. She has a secret crush on a guy she works with but can't seem to think that he would ever like her because of her size. I don't know one woman out there who hasn't felt that we weren't thin, pretty, tall, short, muscular, smart, (fill in the blank) - enough to get the guy we dream of. I feel this book speaks about our society and how we place emphasis on appearances. What this book made me think about is even if we attain what we believe will bring us true happiness, does it really bring happiness? Jane Green shows in this book that appearances aren't always what they seem."
5,"By far, the best book I've ever read",I couldn't put it down. I cannot wait to read the rest of Jane Green's books. A wonderful summer read.
3,Take it along to the beach,A quick easy read containing no real depth or insight. Translation; a good book to read at the beach or when the kids are under foot.
5,Couldn't put it down!,"What else can I say, but Wow! I loved it, and totally related to the story. I started reading it on a Friday night and finished it by Sunday afternoon. So Ladies, sit back, relax, and enjoy!"
5,Non stop entertainment!,"Jemima J. is a well written, thought provoking novel with a hilarity of content! The characters are all believeable and the story is written through Jemima's eyes. Basic content: She goes from fat girl, social reject to slim and trim with men adoring her wherever she went. The major plus for this one: the climatic unexpected twist with her romance and the blunt thoughts of the main character...a must read for a great chuckle!"
2,I think I laughed once...,This book isn't even worth the time and effort that you're going to put into it. I think I finished it out of principal... It's completely unrealistic and anticlimactic. But if you're really into online relationships and crushes then yes... this book is defiantly for you.
2,"shallow, predictable, but strangely likeable","Reading this book is like watching a fluff movie. It is sappy and predictable, but you watch, and read it anyway. I don't think I'll eagerly await the next book, or seek out any more of Jane Green's books, but I finished this one. A light summer read."
2,Not a good message to readers!,"I liked the beginning and the very end. It's the rest I have a problem with. With the author's description of Jemima, I pictured her at over 350 pounds until the author reveals that she is about 5'7 and 217 pounds. That was a shocker! A real woman that size does not match the author's description of the character. I also have a BIG problem with the way Jemima quickly lost the weight. It was not in a healthy way! It also seemed like a lot of the book dealt with outside appearances and not what's on the inside, which is what actually matters."
3,slightly disappointed,"I started reading this story last summer and had to put it down because the main character was, what I thought, [sad]. Just recently I picked the book up and decided to give it another shot. The main character, Jemima, is overweight and lacks self confidence. She is in love with a coworker but she realizes that he would never love her as the fat girl she is. So what does she do? She meets a man online, lies about her life and appearance, then goes on an exercising binge to lose 80 pounds and suddenly become a goddess. With her new looks slowly comes the confidence she has been lacking most of her life but a whole new set of problems....The book has a good theme that beauty is only skin deep, I will give it that much, but I still found it a bit shallow. Green did a much more realistic job writing Mr. Maybe than Jemima J. If you want a good Jane Green book to read, I suggest you bypass this one."
1,overpriced due to markup,"More than doubling the retail price is hoggish. I wish Amazon exercised at least some control over resellers like this who hugely mark up products that can be bought elsewhere on the web, such as from the manufacturer. I recommend you shop around, both to save more than 50% of the price and in order not to support resellers like this. By the way, a similar review to this one was just removed from the website. I guess the reseller doesn't want it to be known how much they mark this product up..."
1,poor,"Bought this CD player in April 2007 from Best Buy. It started failing in August, but I thought it might have been the CD's I was playing. Tried multiple different CDs and now it doesn't even recognize there are 5 CDs in the carousel. Tried to take it back to Best Buy with a receipt from my local bank (didn't have the original) and now I'm out $130. No more Best Buy for me..."
1,Cheap but poorly designed,"This changer takes forever to load a disc, on the order of 20 seconds. In shuffle mode there is also a long delay between songs. It is much, much slower than the Technics changer it replaced in my home. Also the mode selection is confusing and it can't be set to stay in ""shuffle"" mode even though that is where most users will want it. This was really not designed with a user in mind."
4,sexy look,I love these because you can hide any marks on your leggs and the shimmetr looks real good. They wash very good also. They don't run easy but do snag easily
3,rose-colored glasses,"I think that this book is a good introduction to the process. I found, however, that the description of the process is a little too optomistic. After reading this book I found that I went out and starting talking to Modern Orthodox who made it clear that it is their role to dissuade proselytes. The auuthor states that her husband's conversion is based on marriage. I later learned that this is not considered a ""Kosher"" reason to convert. I am currently looking into studying Orthodoxy. It is my advice to the person considering conversion do likewise. Your conversion otherwise may not be observed by the Orthodox.Hopefully, the rejected, inadequacy feeling won't happen to all of you. I am still on my journey. I have found this website to be indispensible..."
5,Highly Recommended,"This is a rarity among English-language books on the subject: an examination of the posthumous appeal of Joan of Arc's case after the war. The book contains extensive excerpts from the testimony given by witnesses during the appeal, similar to ""Joan of Arc By Herself and Her Witnesses"" except focusing on the Rehabilitation testimony. These accounts from people who knew Joan bring the subject to life in a way that no other format can."
4,Nice stands,"These stands matched the finish of our home theater setup, and more importantly fit onto the speakers. The bases are well weighted. The speaker wire runs through the stand, and there is a finish cap to hide the connection on the back of the speaker.My wishes are few: 1) That the price would have been lower, and 2) that the stands would have been flexible (they are pre-bent).Thanks to Sony for making these. I didn't have to hope that non-specific models elsewhere fit our needs and speakers."
1,Sitting in the basement,"Since I was getting the expensive Sony DAV-X1 DVD theater system I thought I would do it right and get Sony speaker stands. They don't work with the system because you can't feed the fat speaker connection through the hollow stand like you would with just speaker wires. Maybe there is an adapter to get for whatever extra $$, but the speakers work fine on each side of the TV. Not worth it for me to send back."
1,The Mighty Johns,"I was really expecting something special after reading Publisher's Weekly's review. I thought the story was predictable and rather foolish. One football player sends six opponents off on stretchers because he knows physics? I also got a little tired of hearing how ""brilliant"" Tor was. Make the point and move on."
3,Pretty good,"Most of the stories were good. There were a few that actually insulted my intelligence.Baldacci is still the master, along with Lahayne and Meltzer. The short stories should be short. Ann Perry is too windy. Mike Lupica is too crude.All in all it was a pretty good read"
3,Read with caution,"I read this book to my 7 and 4 year old children. They really enjoyed having the time with me and the story was very exciting. I would caution parents to the fact that even though this is a highly regarded author for children's book, there are alot instances of nasty name calling by James' aunt and the Centipede refers to another insect ""ass"" on two occasions. When I was reading to my children I just skipped over that but I would be concerned if my child had been reading it alone. My second grader reads above level so parents should be aware that the writing is for an slightly older, not so impressionable child. As a conscientious Christian parent, I object to seeing children's books with harse adult language. This book comes a little too close to that and that is why I recommend this book with reservations."
3,James & the Giant Peach,"I was not happy with the delivery. It took forever and came in three shipments. I ordered another set of class books from Barnes & Noble weeks later than this order and they came first! Although the books were new, the book covers were in poor shape; they were all mottled and rubbed; the finish was damaged. We can use them, but if they had been gifts I would have returned them."
2,Not My Cup of Peach,"I would give James and the Giant Peach, by Roald Dahl, two stars. I thought it could have better details and the words that described the characters were not as vivid as they could be. For example the aunts were mean, fat, skinny and all the rest of the boring words. I think that an awesome writer should have much better details or words to describe someone or something. After all, details make the book more exciting too read. Also the title should have amazing details that catches a reader's attention. From beginning to end, I didn't find it very catchy."
2,Intented for a Christmas Gift,I should have researched it more I guess. It was recommended to me by Amazon when I purchased The Story of Babar. But James & the Giant Peach is NOT appropriate for my 1 and 5 year old granddaughters. I am holding it back in case they ever have a friend who is dealing with abuse.
3,James and the Giant Peach is a good book.,"The story James and the Giant Peach is a spectacular story in wich James is forced to live with his two mean aunts, because his parents died. When the weird little man gives James a package that has magical crystals in it. James gets a little to exited and he trips, falling and breaking the bag. James scrambles around trying to get the magical crystals but they just sink into the ground. After that spectacular things start to happen that will change James life forever. This is the funny, wonderful,and shocking story of James and his journy on the giant peach."
5,"If you like action, this is the book for you!!",This is an awesome book! It is about a boy named James. James' parents die in a plane crash and James is sent to go live with his aunts. His aunts treat him like dirt. One day James meets a magical man. He gives James a bag with little green things in it. James runs home with the bag and suddenly... he drops it. He wakes up in the morning and cleans the mess his aunts made. He soon gets to go into a giant peach and the book tells all about the adventures in it. This was an awesome book!!
4,... Book Review,... I liked it because the person who wrote it had a great imagination. Because the book just blew me away. It wasn't serious. That's why I loved it. All in all it was a great book.
5,READ IT!,"This book was good, because it has some funny parts and some sad. Any how this is a great book to read.This book has a amazing ending, and movie.You should trust me....read it.If you like the author Roald Dahl,thats who wrote this book."
4,"After reading this book, it will instantly become your favor",I read this story to my second grade class and everyone fell in love with James and his insect friends! We were all transported to their magical world. This must be read aloud to all ages! It is great fun!
2,Leaks,I quilt garment and sew and this iron doesn't get hot enough for my needs and now after 18 months it leaks like a sieve. unhappy wish I'd brought a Rowenta which I probably will.
3,not as great as I expected after reading the reviews,"I seem to have bad luck with irons, they leak, just stop working etc., so when I read all the reviews for this iron, I thought I had found a good iron for a reasonable price. I was very dissappointed with the iron. I liked some of the features, being cordless was very nice. I like the burst of steam, but that is where I had a problem. I could start out with a lot of steam, but then have to wait for the iron to get ""Hot"" again, before I had enough steam again. I even wrote the company asking for assistance, that maybe I wasn't doing something right.I never heard back from them. Since, I just got this iron, I decided to send it back right away, because it was not what I expected. I wish I had gotten an iron that worked as well as all of the other reviewers."
5,"No cord, no problems","I bought this iron because I am making my daughter's wedding dress. I needed an iron that wouldn't drip on the expensive fabric, gave me maximum room for all that fabric on the ironing board, had finely controlled temperature, heated evenly, and was neither too heavy or too light. I also hoped that an iron with all those capabilities would also turn itself off after a period of non-use. (I have a bad habit of forgetting to turn off my iron after a long session of sewing.) What a list!After reading lots of reviews I chose the Panasonic NI-L45NR cordless iron and hoped it would live up to those reviews. I can honestly report that it does. It meets all my requirements, and I'm sure that when I'm finished with the wedding dress, I will discover more of its capabilities as I use it on a wider variety of fabrics."
2,beans without meat,"An interesting cookbook, but left me a little disappointed in that I was looking for more ways to prepare beans in general, rather than more ways to cook beans without meat. I'd imagine this book would be more appreciated by a vegetarian than this omnivore who'd prefer a few bean recipes that make use of a ham bone, ham hocks, or even chicken stock to bean brownies."
5,I know it by heart!,My daughter loves this book. She will ask for this book a couple times a week and we have had it well over a year! A very sweet story that my 3 year old can't live without!
1,didnt like the flavor!,"i hated the taste! not good at all for me, i literally have the whole box since august!! tastes reaaaally bad!!"
3,aunt Vi,"My aunt swears by this product. She says that it helps her digestive problems.It also sooths her stomach. She has been using your product for over the past several years, and looks forward to her shipment every month. It has been a positive in her life where her health is concerned."
3,Bad after-taste keeps you at 3-stars,"I use the whole line of shakes but it's a love/hate thang. The initial taste is great but OMG, that after-taste is YUCKY..Those of us who are of a certain age will remember when certain canned foods and drinks left that 'tinny' can tste in your mouth only when done.PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE! Let me enjoy the Butter Pecan, the Vanilla, the Strawberry and the wonderful Chocolate without having to rinse my mouth out after drinking the shake.I know many of you out there can taste it but weren't sure what to think about it."
4,Excellent foundation for motherhood,"I love Sally Clarkson's stories and approachable spirit. She does not put up a facade of flawlessness, but is real with her emotions and reactions. She is also full of grace and wisdom. I'm reading more of her books now."
1,Too Heavy,"Star batons are generally too heavy for beginners. If someone trained on a mid-weight baton, this is too heavy. I do not these heavier weighted batons."
4,Cat approved,I have a very finicky cat when it comes to things applied to his fur- usually tries to lick it off.The scent of this foam was very mild and it was light in texture; he didnt seem to mind it at all.It left the cat's fur shiny and free of residue.
2,You don't get what you pay for,I have not tried the product yet. My shipment arrived today and the bottle is only about half full. Very disappointing for the price.
2,Ehh,"This is more runny than it is foamy, it's literally like giving your cat a bath just without the water and the smell is not that great.."
2,"Contains ""questionable"" parabens",I never used this on my baby. After receiving the product I read the label and noticed it contains parabens. This ingredient has been linked to being a carcinogen. Although I'm not certain it is known to be it is still questionable and that's enough for me not to slather it on my baby.
4,I liked it but...,"I ordered this as a gift for christmas and I got it shipped extremely fast, in plenty of time for christmas. My only problem with it is that it did not come with the wooden rollers to make the ice cream cone shaped Krumkake. There was a sticker on the box saying that the roller was not included due to manufacturer problems but that was never stated in the product description. I wish that it had been, as it would have effected my decision to buy this iron. The iron itself works wonderfully, but I have to hunt down a roller inorder to make what I want to make since it was not included like usual."

3,good but not great,"For 30% less of the cost of this book, you could (as I did) pick up a superior book that details the history of conservation in the country's diverse geographical zones (seacoasts, prairies, jungles and volcanic highlands). That book is ""Costa Rica: The Last Country The Gods Made."""
1,PC USB Controller Converter Review,"Recently, purchased this PC USB Controller Converter but never got to use it. The disc that accompanied the hardware was corrupt."
5,Very good and easy to use!,"For the price of the converter and since it comes with a CD for use of installation, it's worth it. It had 2 red LEDs so im assuming i've got the SUPER DUAL version."
2,CRAPPY Right Analog functionality.,"This lame device will waste your valuable time. Sadly, you will discover that Dualshock 2 controllers lack full right analog functionality on any PC engine. This is due to the way in which you connect them, which is called ""DirectInput"". Full 1:1 controller-->pc support is only true when you connect via ""ActiveX"". And so, that type of functionality is only available via an Xbox360 controller."
1,Failed,"Note that this isn't a Sony product. Nor has it seemed to have been tested prior to release. It provides power to the controller, but if you're looking for more functionality, forget about it. If you've already ordered it, then save yourself the manpower upon delivery and just throw the envelope in the bin."
1,Awful...,"I bought this to play StepMania on my MacBook Pro. It didn't work. It will not register a step if you are standing on another arrow, nor will it register a jump-step. It does not register the ""dance pad code"" - start, select, up for three seconds. Do not buy."
1,Pretty color...pretty useless junk,"Plug it in, load the disc and the driver software loads. Great so far. But as soon as I tried to assign buttons in a game's config options, controls began erratically switching. What I set for Button 10 will switch to Button 4, or 6, or whatever after about a second and repeat.So I figure maybe the ""help"" file will help; if someone manages to understand the file's broken English and severe grammar issues, they deserve a prize. Don't expect to find a better solution at the developer's site either; pretty much the same thing is going on there.I tried numerous drivers provided, and other's completely unrelated. So, unless you plan on screwing with this for DDR purposes, leave it alone. I couldn't get it to work for an rpg or anything. I bought a G-E gamepad later that works great."
5,Works great with Stepmania on Mac OSX,"I purchased this adapter to plug two Red Octane Ignition dance pads into my computer to play Stepmania. I adapter I received is black, and the box says ""Super Dual Box Advance."" It comes with a disc of drivers for Windows. To use on my Mac, I downloaded GamePad Companion, an application that allows Mac to recognize game controllers. Works like a charm in Stepmania! I had to map all of the keys manually, but other than that, it works wonderfully."
5,Gamepad Adapter,"Mine was black, but that really doesn't matter! It works as expected, I used mine with my PS3 to use my PS2 controllers for more players. It works fine in that capacity with the exception of the SixAxis functionality of PS3 controllers. Good product overall!"
4,Works Great With Up To Date Drivers!,"got the see-thru blue converter with the Red LED. this converter did not come bundled with any kind of software or Drivers , but with a little bit of researching i was able to find an up to date driver that works great on my XP Operating System.Also with the Driver Update you can set up Dance Pads with the ""Dance Pad"" Option under Controller Properties and even shows a dance pad layout which works great to check if all the sensors on the dance pad works great. after doing a few small sensor tests for the Dance Pads , Stepmania was able to detect my dance pads with no problems or configurations. I was dancing away in no time.Overall i give this product a 4/5 simply because it did not come with any software , but wasn't too impossible to find. great converter for your PS1 and PS2 Gaming!!"
1,Plug N' Fail,This device didn't work on Windows 7 or 8.I would not buy this product. I should have bought a USB gamepad immediately.
3,Wonderful product for the money,"This adapter does work with Windows 7, but it takes a lot of doing. My computer recognized it upon plugging it in, but I had to go hunt for drivers online because the included CD's drivers didn't work. But after half a day's search I got most of the control buttons to function - all except for the joysticks. So if you're willing to look around for drivers and have some patience, this product will probably satisfy you. If not, you may want to look elsewhere. (Note: I've read a lot of other reviews that say Windows 7 recognized and allowed the controller to work without looking for alternative drivers. I guess it's just the luck of the draw? But for about $5, I can't really complain all that much.)"
3,Not well for DDR Pad,"I got this thing 1 day before its estimated date.when it arrived, only the converter was in the package,no cd.i mapped the bottons for my stepmania game and i cant do jumps on it.no Left+Right or up+down.it works well on the ps2 controller,so at least the controller works"
1,Does not work as advertised,"""This product is not compatible with Windows 7 or Windows XP. The adapter was not recognized by the either system. The CD that came with the adapter supposedly contained the necessary drivers, but installing them did not solve the issue. I would stay away from this product. Then again it is pretty cheap so you might want to give it a try with the hope that it will work for you."""
3,Doesnt work with most PC games,"I got this converter to play GTA VC and SA on PC, however the games do not recognize it as a controller and cannot map controls to it. I was kinda annoyed but it didnt cost that much money. I should have gotten the look alike controller instead which would have worked.PC Emu's will detect it though and work fine. I just really wished it worked for the games I bought it for.Other then that, I got a black colored one, which was fine by me and installing it was quick, vista detected it and installed drivers automatically just by plugging it in."
4,Not too shabby.,"The only bad thing I have to say about this, is that at times it does not want to recognize PS1 controllers, but it seems to pick up PS2 ones just fine. For the price, it's not a bad little cord, and does the job well."
1,Junk,"Could not get my system to recognize the device,said unknow even when pointing to drivers.I have good knowledge of PC stuff and tried different drivers and other options none worked.Try a different one!"
5,Awesome,It works. The only problem I had was when I clicked the dialog settings instead of the analog button. That's about it.
4,It works when it works.,"Well, I have mixed feelings for this adaptor. It acted weird with my Super NES emulator, and didn't work with my MAME at all.I intend to keep it, but I'll wait for a good PSX emulator.I'll get a real PC joypad or joystick.Wii Classic Controller Pro - Black"
1,Doesn't Work With Stepmania,"I bought this to play Stepmania with dancepads. I did everything right - I installed the drivers, mapped the keys, searched for driver updates (there are none), and even tried that bizarre ""up-start-select"" combination, but to no avail. This adapter registers single button bushes, but won't register two buttons being pushed simultaneously, which makes jumps in Stepmania impossible. I assume this works great for normal Playstation controllers (because most games don't require a simultaneous up-down button push), but if you're a DDR nut, spend the extra few bucks to get something that will work - you can get excellent recommendations on the Stepmania forums. Good Luck!"
3,cheap and plug and play,"to product cheap so there the no update or anything addition to the product, the virbration I cannot get it work in game"
2,Almost trash,"I bought this converter because the PS2 controller is a nice pad for fighting games, but this converter has a frustratingly noticeable input delay (using Windows 7) that disrupts timing on technical fighters. The device should be sufficient for general game emulation, though. As others have noted, the converter is black, not see-through blue."
4,hard to get on,I have always liked berkshire tights. They are very smooth and comfortable but they are hard to put on. You have to put your legs into the strap that goes around your waist and then line up the garters on each side. takes a bit of time but they are very comfortable. i like them better than sheer to waist ones. next time i think i am just going to purchase thigh highs though.
3,Dictionary of book talk,"Great book which came highly recommended by serious collectors. This is a great book for bibliophiles, but for general book lover this work is somewhat highly priced. This book teaches one the lingo of book talk and contains names on pages, cover, jacket, etc.I would probably go as far as saying that this book is definitely over rated. Author is well known in book circles, therefore anyone who's who in book collecting business will give a high regard to this work.Generally speaking, other than interesting remarks like 'this page is called verso' its just a dictionary of book terms. Most, if not all of the price guides contain same information such as 'Official Price Guide to Collecting Books' and 'Book Collectors Price Guide'.For antique book collector this work is a must have, but for general collector price guide will suffice."
5,My guinea pig's favorite toy!,"I've had to buy two, because he misses it when one is being washed. It's his favorite, he sleeps with it, talks to it, pushes it around with him."
4,"An exciting, yet complicated read.","I read ""The Truce at Bakura"" when it first came out in paper back and the ""Trilogy"" was just a wonderful movie memory. This book brought all the excitement of the movies back. I was very leery of the book at first because I thought it would never live up to the movies, but in it's own complicated way it exceeded the movies. It takes many twists and turns but the real pay off is the author's understanding of the characters and the way she stays true to Luke, Leia, and Han. Because this book captured my imagination, I have read everyone of the new ""Starwars"" novels and will continue to do so."
5,THIS IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this one out of curiosity, but when I started reading it I finished it in one day!!!! Finally someone describes Luke as a normal person who thinks of other things than ancient mysteries and strange powers. And the Ssi-ruuvi are definitely the best aliens ever imagined in Sw or other universe!!! But why did this one have to be so short? Why couldn't it have at least three parts as long as this one????????? Keep going, Kathy Tyers!!! And by the way, Luke IS a blonde!!!!!"
3,"Dissapointing, but worth a read","For a story to continue immediately after Return ofthe Jedi, I was a little dissapointed. You just can'tcompare it with the likes of Tim Zahn or KevinAnderson. It just lacks the Star Wars atmospherethat would usually be expected from a Star Warsnovel. I would have expected a stronger bookthan this to follow on from ROTJ. I fear that anyonewho reads this book first (of the Star Wars books)would never want to read another Star Wars bookagain. I suppose it's worth reading once, but Iwouldn't read it again"
4,A good stroy... but not great.,"This was the 1st Star Wars book I read in the post-RotJ era. I must say, it was not bad... but not good either. It lacked action, the entire middle was boring... but at least the story kept itself along. Good points were the new invaders, the forced peace between the alliance and empire, and Liea's visit from Anakin Skywalker. Bad was the boring relations between Luke and that one girl, and Dev's ""enslavement"". If you really want to know what happened after Jedi, then read this... but if you want action like in the movies go read Zahn's books."
5,Anything to do with Luke is good but this is amazing,It was nice to see Luke finally fall in love but it was just a pity that he never kept her. It was written in true SW spirit and would be very interested in reading more of her books. MTFBWY.....always.
1,Sucked Out the Life-Force Like a Ssi-Ruuk,"In this installment of the EU, the rebels learn that not everybody hates the Empire and loves the Jedi. The storyline is awful, and the only thing in it worth reading is what happens to Luke because of all the Force lightning. If you want to retain your sanity, do not read this book."
2,A good idea but bad writing.,"I did not like this book ,although, I love all the new ships and the new characters. The aliens and there ship were very cool. The book started very well, but as the went on the plot nearly end and everyone just sat around. As the book neared the end the story got more interesting, but there was know reason for the alien retreat. They had lost there flag ship but they still could have defeated the rebels and the empire. They should scrap this book and have Timothy Zahn rewrite it."
2,Please wake me up when its over!,This book was way over rated. It was so boring I actually looked forward to falling asleep. I think if you read this book you really have to be into Star Wars.
4,"It was very informative and political,needed more action.",This book is definitely for high level readers.It has a lot of politics and neogociating by words.It has action action a little fight here and there.Suspence arous however more to the end.But sad to say the last few chapters are the best part in the story.
3,This book didnt stack up,This book just did not live up to the high standards set by Zahn's books. I suggest you read Heir to the Empire if you want to read a good book.
5,This is the best place to start reading the SW novels!,The Truce at Bakura is hands-down the best place to start reading the novels if you're looking to pick up right after Return of the Jedi. The book starts the very next day after Vader kills the Emperor. Luke and Leia team up with an unlikely ally to defeat a common enemy. Follow this book up with The Courtship of Princess Leia.
3,"Lets say ""cooperation"" everybody!","This novel is set just hours after ""Return of the Jedi"" A group of super aliens (from outside Star Wars' Galaxy) have come to invade this outer world, Bakura. The Imperials and Rebels form a truce (which is held loosely on both ends) in order to prevent these aliens from entering the Star Wars Galaxy. I think this plot has been done, though (Earth forces team up to stop evil aliens?) and that detracts from the uniqueness of Star Wars. It is an okay book, but I've read better."
5,Let's just say this book ROCKS!,"I've read some of the other Star Wars books, and they've all been boring.THIS one, however... The whole book was really interesing, funny, emotional, in-depth, etc., a masterpiece. This is not just my favorite Star Wars book or science fiction book, but my favorite book of all time. Kathy, PLEASE write another book."
2,Not the Best Star Wars Book.,"While perhaps worth reading if you enjoy Star Wars, this book was slow, boring, and contradictory."
3,The regular run of the mill star wars novel,"Just another SW novel with lots of explosions and trickery, the characters are unrecognizable, they are felt somewhat tired, our galactic heroes are the only persons to whom something interesting happens in the whole galaxy. The bad guys in this story could have been further developed, if you analyze the concept of taking someone's mind to inhabit inside a battledroid it really sounds very scary, but they were easily defeated as ever. A fun read anyway"
4,"Enjoyable, but I have a question.","I really like this book, but I have an important question:On page 81 (paperback-middle of chapter 6), Nereus says, ""His Imperial Majesty {aka Emperor Palpatine} should never have trusted a Sith lord.""Was Palpatine not a Sith lord himself? I have always believed that he was. I referred to Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Characters and all that I have found in the biography of Palpatine regerding the Sith is that Palpatine ""and the newest Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, instigated a great Jedi Purge.""Am I missing something?"
3,Mixed feelings,Actually the only parts I liked was the fights betweenthe Ssi Ruuk and Luke.And when Luke falls upon the earth and puts himself ina Jedi trance to fool the Empire that his heart has stoppedbeating.I tend to like new creatures unknown to the New Republicand the technologies these creatures use.
5,Nice product,"I purchased an 18"" chain. My order arrived very quickly. The chain is nice and appears sturdy. In my opinion, this is a good product."
2,"Sorry, was this the VHS version?","I know small companies will never be able to technically match big ones like Dreamworks, 20th Century Fox etc. but they could at least make some effort.""Body Strokes"" looks, for all it's worth, like a bad copy of a VHS tape. The film is blurry, the colours are smeared and washed out. Overall picture quality is horrible.Sound is your basic stereo, and there are no extras on the disk, but it was the lousiness of the picture that got me the most. I should have bought the VHS version..."
1,Gamecube controller disappointment,I ordered this for my son's birthday gift and it doesn't work very well. He is not able to turn left on any game. Major disappointment!
4,A good controller,"I would rate this controller a 5, if it had a larger d-pad. For retro 2d gaming, using this d-pad is painful. I haven't shopped around, but I would imaging there are gamecube controllers that have a larger d-pad, you may want to consider them instead unless they are poorly made."
4,my new/used platinum gamecube controller.,"I bought this controller as a birthday present(for myself) and it was a great product for its price. The buttons all worked great, came with rumble pack and everything So it was great. The only bad thing about it was some minor scratches, but overall it works great."
4,Great for 2year's!,I got this controller in June of 2002 after I got my gamecube for my BDAY. Today they both turn by themselves in games and my dad loves Sonic Mega Collection so it drives him nuts. Otherwise its good and I think 4 stars is generous.It has been stepped on by a 300 pound person when I dropped it on the sidewalk and survived so...
3,Stiff,"The controller is my least favorite thing about my Gamecube. The joystick dosen't move like a ps2 controller, it is very stiff. The second joystick is a yellow nub like on a psp. The d-pad was the stiffest."
3,I called it...,"I purchased two controllers because I had heard that the chances of getting a working one were risky and these were cheap. As I suspected, one of them works perfectly; the other does not (the charatcers on my games continue walking left or right).That's what you get when you purchase from someone you don't know and can't see.~Charlie"
4,Good and cheap,"I needed 4 of these and, being a poor college student, wasn't looking to spend much money. These were just the right thing, cheap and name-brand. They were listed as used ""good condition"", but it hasn't been an issue. Especially due to the fact that they don't get used on a daily basis.Also, very fast shipping, although the tracking wasn't very impressive.Overall, I am very pleased."
5,Great,When I ordered this product I was hoping I'd get the legit Nintendo Gamecube Controller and that's exactly what I got. Minor wear and tear like the seller said but still works precisely as it should. Very satisfied.
2,Forgotten for a reason,"This was to be Mike Heron's entry into the late seventies American pop market that had the misfortune of being released the same week that the label (Casablanca) that issued it declared bankrupcy. This glossy, over-produced album never had a chance. Instantly bound for the cut out bins, it never got promotion or airplay, this is his most removed from the ISB style that he ever released. The songs themselves aren't bad, indeed he has keep performing Mexican Girl and a couple of others but, the layer upon layer of slick studio sound tires the ear quickly. Producer Hugh Murphy had hit it big with Gerry Rafferty about that same time, but missed with Mike Heron. For the most rabid ISB/Mike Heron fans only."
5,Royal Danes - back again!,"It seems as if Danish royalty has some allure all of its own and I'm thinking this is due to good old Shakespeare. This book is a wonderfully exciting account of life at court in the 17th century. The main characters are all well-rounded and, despite their flaws, likeable."
5,A great historical read,"Coming from Denmark and having Christian IV as my ""favourite king"" I was a bit apprehensive before starting a book written by someone from England. Rose Tremain put my fears to shame. It is a truly excellent book, and Tremain shows that she masters the art of combining historical facts with a riveting fictional story about people who in one way or another is connected with the danish court. It is not the last time I will pick up a book by Tremain."
4,It depends on what you are seeking.,"If ever there was a book which treated Christmas as a dry, historical narrative,this is it. Very well written, with insights I had never considered, it is not going to make some people happy because it is so academic.The details and chronology throughout the history of Christmas were fascinating, although she cannot seem to help making personal commentaries. This was especially frequent in Chapter 7 where she lingered far too long with far too many commentaries on the ""Black Christmas"" experience. While I found the chapter thought provoking, I could have done without all the soap box.If you are truly interested in the history of various Christmas traditions and their evolution, this is the book for you - dry, but detailed.If you are more interested in beautiful pictures and fluff (I have MANY like that)you should probably pass."
5,nice!!,this is a THICK book on the history of american christmas celebrations. read it in 2 sittings and really enjoyed it
1,Ricky Martin Europa,"True Ricky Martin fans beware!! This DVD promises alot, but delivers little. I was very disappointed. The sound is muffled, and the pictrue quality is poor. The special features and bonus material are a joke. ..."
4,A fine book.,This is a fine piece of literary scholarship. It really created a whole way of looking at texts. I use it every year in my Postcolonial Studies class. More examples from popular culture could help.
5,One of the best for young adults I have ever read,It was the title that first drew me in and then it was one of the few books I have read that I couldn't put down. That's why I gave it five stars.
1,Why album only?,"seeing the songs I truly only wanted ""pass the flame"" however I have absolutely no interest in anything elsethis is why songs get stolen, why pay 10 bucks for 1 song and toss the other 9? My $1.29 is better being spent on a burger from Mcdonlads"
3,Sputters way too much,"This unit looks great when clean, but start using it and it makes a really big mess upon itself and a 2 foot radius around the exhaust hole. My old ""National"" had a very light aluminum lid without a hole which used to lift up to let the steam out, but the Sanyo EC-505's lid is quite heavy and the little exhaust hole isnt good enough to control the steam. The result - a very messy kitchen."
5,Great Multi-purpose product,I love this rice cooker/steamer. The non-stick surface makes clean-up a breeze. It is compact and efficient.
1,"Mess, Mess, Mess","I don't understand how anyone cooks with this. It blows out an immense amount of gooey steam water! I cooked brown rice, followed directions exactly, even soaking for an hour first. It was only 2/3's of the capacity, but it blew junk out the sides of the lid and out of the little blowhole and left a large puddle of gooey rice water around and under itself. A MAJOR mess.I haven't even tasted the rice. So what if it's good? You can't cook with an appliance like this unless you put it in a giant sink or outdoors somewhere. What in the world is the deal? I don't even know if I can clean it up enough to return it...."
1,Lid broke for no good reason,"I had high hopes for this simple, small rice cooker. Unfortunately, disaster struck on the first time out. I cooked 2 cups of brown rice without washing it first (my preference). The rice cooked perfectly. There was a little spitting but nothing like the other reviewers describe. I scooped out about a cup to eat and, because the instructions say not to leave the unit on ""warm"" with a small amount of rice, I turned it off and let the remaining rice sit while I ate. After about 15 minutes or so I heard a loud ""bang"" in the kitchen and found that the lid had broken into a million pieces. I don't see any other complaints like this, so it was probably some kind of defect, but that's what happened!"
4,Very interesting,Great WWII story that probably not many people have ever heard of. Not many men of women could have survived under those circumstances for so long as Jan did.
2,rather disappointing,"Coincidences, improbabilities and technical errors don't make a hell of a book. WHen the women escape they are picked up by the one looney in the world who would advance the plot - ugh contrived.The hostage takers and the hostages are in the area of the hospital that is the old x-ray deptartment and is heavily shielded so the cops can't get it - BUT they do use a cell phone - doesn't happen. The shielding works on all radiation including cell phones.Most suprising, the pathologist starts to write her autopsy reports from memeory - is there a pathologist in the US that doesn't dictate while the autopsy is going on? - not in the last 20 years."
3,"Fair story, poor character development","I selected this book, to test if I could enjoy the authorUnfortunately, what I have found was a light crime novel with poor character development with the exception of the portrayal of Jane Rizzoli, the hero of the plot, whom one can feel in her emotions and endeavors. The story as a whole is more suitable for a 2 two hour TV series because for a plot in a book its quality goes far below the standards of other American Crime authors. For the future, I will not read any other Tess Gerritsen book with the exception of ""The Surgeon"", which was highly recommended by readers"
5,Terrific high concept thriller,"""Vanish,"" the latest novel from bestselling author Tess Gerritsen, is a terrific ""high concept"" thriller -- a story built around an easy-to-grasp premise that grips an audience right away and won't let go.It begins with the body of a beautiful woman in the Boston morgue. Just another accidental death -- until she suddenly comes back to life. At the hospital, she seizes a security guard's gun and takes several hostages. One of them is homicide detective Jane Rizzoli, who is due to give birth at any moment. It is up to Rizzoli's husband, FBI agent Gabriel Dean, to get his wife and unborn child out safely.From that basic set-up, the author weaves a spellbinding tale of government conspiracy and white slavery, with themes as current as the morning newspaper. Some of it might be a little overblown, but there's no denying the power of Gerritsen's storytelling.""Vanish"" is a perfect example of the best-selling thriller: action-packed, entertaining and compulsively readable."
2,Great start but then fizzles out...,"The book starts off fantastic... Sets up a great premise with Jane in labor after a courtroom incident. Then she's suddenly involved in hostage situation while still in labor with any rescue attempt having to helplessly wait outside, you think you're about to go on a wild ride.. but instead what you get from that point on is a long drawn out character study of others and then zooming back and forth and sideways into situations that were not just far fetched but that I found just no emotional attachment, so that for me made it very tedious and boring .Jane is the one we care about and to put her in a dangerous, very vulnerable situation only to switch gears and to then not even make her the central point was totally deflating for this reader. If Tess had stayed more focus on the initial scenario I would of rated it much higher"
4,Good thriller,"Could give this book 5 stars, but the ending was rushed. The characters acted irrational. But I did enjoy the plot and characters a lot during the reading."
2,so disappointed,"I tried using this thing to play Melee fresh out of the package, but the buttons are infuriatingly unresponsive (C-stick is totally busted!). I'd give it one star if it didn't fit in my hand just like a real first party controller, even though it feels cheaply made...well, at least it's orange."
5,Robinair 18192 R-134A Coupler set,This Robinair R134a manual replacement coupler set fits standard size lines and allows transfer of freon as it is designed to do
5,Challenging,"Completely different from what I expected. Solidly grounded in truth, this book was both refreshing and challenging. A great read."
5,lovely,A great comfort and encouragement! Practical and beautifully written. Sally is a kind neighbor to chat with after chapter one and your very dear friend for life after you are finished. Her teachings are so simple but can cause profound change in how you go about your mothering. Love it!
2,Blooper spotting is the real fun of this video; but not bad.,"It's only too bad the rather fun idea of a vampire running a major corporation in LA is run in to the ground by the over acting of the principles. For real fun count the continuity errors. Also, the dumb cop side-kick is fun to watch. He at least had the good sense to have fun with his role."
5,THe Moffatts are THE band!,"Now, if you see a picture of the Moffatts, you'll probably just think that they're just another bunch of kids trying to make a living by strainig their voices,and yelling in the microphone. WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!These guys can sing. AND they're are so absolutely adorable. You have to buuy this CD. If not, you're missing something good."
2,uhn...,"i didnt really like this cd. and i didnt love their concert.... sowey, thats my opinion.... if ya want a really good cd, buy: Live from Albertane, by Hanson! its an awesome cd!or significant other, by limp bizkit.... but slim shady, by eminem is the best cd ever! keep on rocking! buhbye amy"
2,"Hardly tastes like chocolate, too sweet, too thick","This barely has any chocolate flavor at all. What it does have, however, is an excessive amount of sweetener. I prefer things not to be very sweet, so your taste may differ, but I find it almost intolerably sweet. I also find that when I make it in a blender with ice as recommended it can be rather unpleasantly thick. Here's what I do to make it more to my taste: use only one to one and a half scoops (the instructions say to use two); use skim milk rather than water; and add a tablespoon or so of plain cocoa powder. I've doctored this in many other ways for variety: add mint extract, or cinnamon, or half a banana, etc. Of course, some of these modify the calorie count and nutritional content of the finished shake, so adjust accordingly."
1,Can't figure how to attach it.,"I've put on toilet seats before and they are pretty much no-brainers. However, I can't figure this one out. No directions so I went online and got directions for this model --- except that Kohler has changed the pieces used to attach the seat to the bowl. My Ph.D. husband is stumped also."
2,"great stuff,bad sound",jackson is my favorite soul singer and the material is great. poor sound quality like one hears when the recording was done with a mike. chuck jackson live is worth having so the buy was worthwhile if you are a fan. but a best of would be better for someone just looking for a representative album.
4,my 9 year old daughter loves it,My 9 year old daughter played this game at a friend's house and asked for it for her birthday. She is happy with it and we have had a good time playing it.
4,It's fun but the party doesn't last,"I heard from many people that this game was great, and at first they were right. My wife and I played a couple of the ""boards"" and we enjoyed ourselves. I think my wife still likes the game while I see it only fun if you had, say, four people total. It's an interesting concept and the boards vary a bit but that's really it.There's a few other things to do but they seem to be just filler. If you can get this on sale and have four people in the household, I say get it. If it's just you...rent it."
5,"This is a very fun game ""family"" game",I got this game for Christmas from all the reviews about how fun for the entire family this was and it did not disappoint.My 6 year and 4 year old are having a blast with it. The mini-games can be challenging even for grown-ups but it all in the name of good fun. This is one of the few games in my collection that is constantly being played.
2,Returned after one day,"I heard a lot about this game and was very excited to finally buy it. Unfortunately, i was extremely disappointed with it. The game was very boring and after about an hour of repetition, we gave up. We returned the game the following day."
2,They do too much!!,"These games were awesome on n64 and mario party 4 and 5 were pretty good, but ever since then they sucked honestly, the first two were the best in my opinion, they were simple and fun, but i think the 1st was a little better then the 2nd, so i think they should stop making these games, and also super smash bros. on wii is great but not as good as the 1st 1 but good"
3,Meh...,"I'm not sure why, but I was excited to get this game. It was rather disappointing. Menu system is slow and kludgy. Gameplay is so-so. It can get a little slow or boring with 4 people.I'd say invest in WiiPlay, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz or even Warioware: Smooth Moves before you get this game."
3,Girls can't put it down.,"I picked up Mario Party for my family and I to play a video board game together. Little did I know my Wife, her stepdaughter, and our daughter would go nuts playing it over and over. This really is a family game, but I feel like girls will like it more than guys. We still play it over 3 weeks later and we're now trying to unlock everything in the bazaar. If you're a first-time Wiier, and you have a family with at least 50% girls in it, get this game. You will get them into it just as much as I did with my family. The only downside is it can get monotonous and strategy is pretty minimal, but the minigames break the monotony just enough to keep it fun."
4,mario party 8,good game. Easy enuogh for my 6 year old daughter. not good reader but shows illusrtations which is enough
2,"Slow, like a board game","First impression: This is my first experience with the Mario Party game series. The board games are fun, but the downside is parts of them can be slow. This game takes a minimum of an hour to play with just one player even with the fastest settings. Most of this time is spent watching the same video animations over and over again. There isn't a way to save the game (unless I missed something) so you can't stop halfway into a stage. The tournament style does start you at the beginning of the stage you were on before, but I wish it would save in the middle of a stage. Each stage is well designed and creative. The minigames are fun, and once you unlock them in the normal board game you can play them by themselves.SUMMARY: I expected something faster paced and I am disappointed. It could be used to relax at the end of a day for those with time, but I don't think I'll play it much and I regret choosing this game."
1,Lame Game,"I love mini-games. I love casual games. I love multi-player games. I love Mario games. I hate Mario Party 8.The game was so lame I tried to take it back to the store for a refund. The controls are sluggish and there is hardly anything to the game. Instead of getting this, get Super Monkeyball (with it's large collection of mini-games, some good and many lame), or Big Brain Academy (all good), or something else, anything else.This game moves so slow, that my son wanted me to make the game start, while we were towards the end of playing a game."
5,super fun for the whole family,super fun for adult and child alike. so far haven't found another game like this one. We'll be ordering Mario Party 9 when it gets released in the US.
4,"Fun, but there are some caveats.","Mario party games are a lot of fun for a group of people to play. The mini games are usually pretty well thought out, the graphics are cartoon-y and appealing, and the board game approach works. This game does a good job of bring the interactivity of the Wii and the party style of the original 7 party games together.That being said, I guess my only complaint is, apart from the new Wii control scheme, nothings really changed. You still have to sit through computer players turns, the graphics haven't really been updated, and the ""single player"" is tedious and not worth your time.However, I still highly recommend this game for the Wii because of the multiplayer. This system is supposed to be a ""party"" experience and this game is very fun with a big group. The learning curve is almost non-existent, I was able to get my grandparents playing this game in less than an hour. Get this game and invite your friends over. You'll be entertained for hours."
4,Fun for a while....,"when i first heard that the wii was coming out with mario party 8 i was very excited. i had high hopes for this new game, since i am a big fan of the mario party games. once i recieved the game, i was pleasantly surprised! there are 5 different boards (the goomba board is pretty lame though) and numerous games to play. after all the games were unlocked, the game became somewhat less exciting and repetitive. i didnt have the problem with the checkboard border around the screen like some of the other reviewers had talked about, so it must depend on your tv!"
1,No power indicator,"I just purchased it and I am not sure whether it will work or not, but the 1st thing I noticed is that it has no power indicator. So how will I know the battery is out? Until the bugs bite me?"
4,Lots of fun,"My son loves his &amp;quot;rev-ups rev-ups&amp;quot; as he calls them. He's almost three and plays with this all the time. We bought him the other playsets to go with it and a few more cars too. The only draw back we have is the tracks fall apart easily and for a three year old he can't fix them himself, so we were constantly repairing the tracks. We finally just used a little hot glue to secure them a little better and now he's good to go."
2,Disappointing,"Being a faithful follower of the Shabby Chic style, I was disappointed to see that most of the material in this book (pictures also) were pulled out of her TV show.If you have seen her shows then you don't need this book.I was expecting new pictures, new material, new ideas.Her last book was a constant inspiration for me when decorating my home."
1,Much ado about nothing,"This book was an extreme let down. I even showed my sister in law just to make sure I was not judging it too harshly, and she agreed that the ideas inside were not very great at all. If you are looking for a truly original book on parties and gift giving with lots of ideas, beautiful photographs and drawings, I would recommend Tracy Porter's Inspired Gatherings."
1,Boyle Over For Lisa!,"Do yourself a favor - leave your brain at the door for this one. Lisa Boyle plays a domineering tramp who likes to play psychological games with her lover. Destined to beat her at her own game, he follows along, only to find himself at her constant whim. If you're going to purchase this movie, so you can place it in your video collection right next to ""101 Dalmations"" and ""Shindler's List"", that's your fault. This is the best case of an overseas billionaire investor producing an ""artistic, erotic picture"". If you're purchasing it for a certain pleasure, and not for Lisa Boyle's not so stellar performance (sample dialogue: (in a baby voice) ""He won't share me. He was piggy!"",then knock yourself out! Just remember to hide it somewhere in your closet, with the rest of your ""classics""!"
3,"Hawkwind - 'Winter Solstice, 2005' (Hawkwind)","Reason I'm giving this concert DVD a three star rating is because the sound quality is pretty decent - I thought. Funny how I was unable to find many reviews of this particular DVD. I find it strange how the entire fifteen song / 80 minute gig was taped from a SINGLE angle + about (I'm guessing maybe twenty rows back). What's the deal here? Should have had (maybe?) every other song normally filmed. Regardless, it was still good to hear the set list here, some fine tunes - like ""The Right Suff"", the new (er) ""Angela Android"", two tracks off their 'Hall Of The Mountain Grill' lp - ""Paradox"" and ""Psychedelic Warlords"" as well as ""Spirit Of The Age', the (always) *ss-kicking ""Assassins Of Allah"" and the old B-side rarity ""Brainbox Pollution"". Just glad to see this DVD selling for the reasonable price that it is."
5,Introspective Beauty,"I was 11 years old when this album was released.I saved up my allowance an bought it on cassette, which wore thin from playing a billion times. (slight exageretion). I am now 30, and the exestentialist, lyics still haunt me as when was achild and could'nt possibly understand what true pain and loss was.I was however able to recognise the honesty and beauty (however bleak) of the minimalist songs like King of Pain, and Wrapped Around Your Finger. The messages are even more profoundly relevent today in my adult life. This is art that has deeply affected me."
4,murder by numbers,"i'm annoyed that they tacked on 'murder by numbers' to the end of this re-issue, since it wasn't on the original LP. a previous reviewer says it ruins the mood of empty existentialism of the album after 'tea in the sahara'. i could not agree more. it's a fine song but it's so clearly not a part of the carefully structured narrative of 'synchronicity' i think it should be listened to separately. sounds like nitpicking, i know, call me a purist."
4,Good,"The one thing I miss is the reggae feel they had on their first albums. But this is a fine piece of work and the last decent piece of work Sting did, or probably ever will do. He's recorded the equivalent of Muzak on his solo albums. So do yourself a favor and listen to SYNCHRONICITY instead."
1,Not that great,"I was buying enzymes from GNC that almost worked too well. They left me constipated and were extremely expensive. I saw these at the store and they were much cheaper, I tried them and it was like taking nothing at all. I had some left and gave them to my older dog because she was going loose and they did nothing for her either. I'm looking for a better brand with a muliti-enzyme foruma. These only have papain in them which helps digest proteins. Some enzymes help digest fats, milk sugars and carbs."
4,Happy Seventh Birthday!!!!!!,I loved this book!! I liked the part where Elizabeth and Jessica take the presents they got for each other!! They must have loved there birthday presents!
2,Not Kat Martins best,This book was similar to her last book. This was predictable and a bit boring. I hope Ms.Martin goes back to her earlier form of writing.
1,anecdotal praise from outdoor living enthusiast,"Anecdotal proofs are compelling but mean almost nothing. These electromagnetic devices are not new, but it is amazing at how the claims purport to repell rodents, insects, and everything else while being harmless to people and pets.. I repeat my appraisal that if you want to throw away your money, you are welcome to buy one of these useless devices. They do nothing and there is no evidence anywhere to prove that they have any useful effect, other than the promise of unimaginable successful control of every pest under the sun. Good luck... by the way I am a Board Certified Entomologist and work in this field. I am always looking for better methods and approaches to pest management. I would be delinquent if I didn't warn consumers about this kind of useless product. Wonder who the outdoor living enthusiast is..?"
1,Pass the DEET...,"Doesn't work against mosquitos - at all. Does not claim to be effective against other biting pests, either.Stick with a DEET-based repellant if you don't want to wind up as some bug's lunch.Zero stars."
2,I think it worked,"I used it on a long weekend in the woods. I didn't get bit much. But it was hard to know when it was on. 2 of the 3 made a high pitch sound when turned on, the 3rd just clicked.I did get bit once and put the device near the mosquito and it never flinched. Found them cheaper at CVS drugstore."
1,"scratch, scratch, itch, itch","While wearing one of these items, not only did I find that it didn't repel mosquitos, I could have sworn it attracted them! Once, in the space of 15 minutes, I ended up with over 20 bites. As for the basics, it was difficult to tell whether it was on, and it also kept falling off.If you're looking for better mosquito control, try the ""Off!"" brand's Mosquito Lamp, a candle-based mosquito repellant. It works best in smaller areas like porches or patios (15' x 15'), but I can say that in my experience, as long as I had one of the lamps lit, I got no bites."
1,Annoying characters,"I read this a while ago, but it still sticks in my mind as one of the worst books I have ever read.Twila is whiny and annoying and indecisive. I found her obsession with her egg cells selfish. Also, I hated the love interest she ended up with.This could have been a good book -- the world was certainly interesting -- but Twila's whininess and the overall bad writing style ruined it."
1,Utterly Useless,"I bought this card for use in my Nokia 6230 phone, only to find that this MMC card could not be accessed with my phone OR my computer. My computer and phone have absolutely no problems reading the 32Mb card that came with my phone. I thought that the first one i had ordered was just a fluke, only to find that the replacement card (which to Amazon's credit arrived promptly the same week) had almost the same problem-useless. Because of Amazons good customer service (so far,anyways)i will order a replacement MMC card made by a different manufacturer through them."
3,"Works fine, but size is off !!!","Got this for a Nokia 6230i it worked fine and was easily detected by the phone. However, it seems that the dimensions on this thing are a bit smaller than they should. The card fits, but with a bit of space left in the socket, so the card moves somtimes if the phone is shaken or dropped.This causes the phone to no longer access the card until it is read adjusted into its place. I solved this by placing a small piece of masking tape above the card to keep it from moving."
5,A convincing and compelling novel,"I was recently traveling in England and saw a review of Olshan's latest novel in the Guardian. I cut it out and then read the book. Vanitas is quite fascinating and compelling reading -- all-in-all an extremely ambitious effort. It demonstrates his abilities both as a story-teller and as a keen observer of human character. I confess that though I thought Vanitas had many brilliant moments that I preferred his previous novel, Nightswimmer. Nightswimmer was less ambitious and yet somehow more crystalized and more lyrical. Still, Vanitas is marvelous reading."
3,Interesting and moving but made me sick (literally!),"While the emotions of this film pour forth and one can feel the life that Rosetta is living - I could not watch this movie in one evening's sitting. The free movement of the camera might allow a more intemate feeling to the movie, but it was overdone to the point that my head and eyes hurt. Sorry, that does not provide the type of enjoyment wanted when watching this type of movie."
3,Thoughtful,"This movie is not entertainment--it's meant to provoke thinking.No music, shaky camera work that'll scar off 98% of American viewers, no special effects--it's definitely not appealing.But we can relate to Rosetta's desire for a normal life and to simply have a job."
4,Almost perfect,I would have given this 5 stars but the top pump is a little flimsy. I like to fill it with hot chocolate but it is just a little to small to fit all the hot chocolate in it the way I make it. Other than those small things it is perfect.
1,Not worth the money,"Came with a piece missing. The company shipped me the missing piece, but that was disappointing. I find it very difficult to pump and if you move it, it leaks. A huge disappointment all the way around."
4,It does the work!!!,"I never used a pump dispenser before...just a call to C.Serv. and this really worked very well,specially after delivering my baby girl, making my life easier....I wish I had it with me at the hospital!"
5,It's HOT!! ....,"I don't like how hard it is to open it to pour liquid in/out. You have to press a button AND at the same time; get your finger-nail somehow into a crevice that looks like it's one piece and doesn't come apart. Once you open it, it looks like a bird beak opening up. Also, I wish that the top came all the way off so it could be washed easier since it looks like it would not be a good idea to get water into the top....Otherwise it's great! And for anyone who has a child, (or for adults) the sticker on top says: ""CAUTION: May contain hot liquid...""It holds a full pot of coffee, a 14-C if there was one made that brews more than 12-c, so it's great for many people. And it even comes in different colors!Thermos makes a pretty reliable product and this one is one. It deserves 4 stars, but I've given it 5 to offset the harshness of another. Between our 2 averages, it gets what it deserves, 4 stars."
3,Not quite what you see in the picture,"I bought this airpot to replace a nearly identical one which had a lever instread of a button on top. The pot is made in China, and is just OK, if a little cheaply made.My problem is with the plastic coated paper label that was glued onto the outside of the pot. The label is large and unsightly and covers the entire bottom half of the pot all the way around. It is not just 'tacked' in place either, it has glue on 100% of the paper surface.I had to soak, peel, and then use a toxic solvent to get it and the glue residue off to make it look like the picture.If youre buying for the shop or the garage, it's OK. If it's for the kitchen or dining room, I'd get a different brand if I had a do-over."
3,Disappointed,The thermos vacuum-insulated pot worked ok keeping liquids hot. I was just disappointed in how the pump opened. Other pump pots I have used were much easier to open. SCB
4,great but,"hey, it IS a two quart insulated thermos pump pot as advertised. what is missing from the photo is a thick paper band around the base of the pot making sure the world knows this is a thermos product. perhaps after six months of repeated washings this band will work itself free of the pot. removing it now would require scraping which would ruin the surface of the pot."
2,"Works well, but beware of label!!!","This product worked well for keeping liquids warm, and we didn't have the problem with the push pump that others have reported. The huge problem that we had was a Thermos label stuck with pretty aggressive adhesive all the way around the exterior of the item. My wife spent over two hours with soap, water, Goof Off, etc. to try to get it off, and once off, you can still tell it was there. I have no idea why they would have done that--a simple paper sleeve would have worked just fine to tout their brand (and really, it was in a Thermos box, so any sleeve or label was superfluous from the start). If we didn't need it to entertain so quickly after it arrived, we would have returned it out of frustration alone."
3,For beginners only,"The book is quite mediocre, very framed, a lot of redundant and repeating information. The author tried to summarize all the concepts together, but, understandibly, this is quite difficult to do. The questions to be asked in each particular scenario sometimes irrelevant. There is not enough consistency between frameworks in the first part and actual examples in the second. In general - I would advise this book only to those, who have never seen any case before and never heard of any."
4,Pokemon Channel,"I'd like to admit that this game is really fun. I was greatly excited when I saw the commercial for it. The thought that a new pokemon game for Nintendo Gamecube is out now was exciting! I rented it at Blockbuster a long time ago! Eventually I bought it and had a lot of fun raising and traveling with a graphical pikachu; meeting other pokemon, collecting pokemon cards in the game, and getting to watch new fun pokemon related channels every day! My favorite was ""Shopping Squirtle"" and Pichu. Bros.-wich is a cartoon about (not video game like,it was real animation) - about the 2 observant pichus you saw in Pokemon 3 the movie! You would like it too."
4,Just as advertised (mostly)...,"Excellent quality product that does exactly what it's supposed to do. Everything is incuded. The hardest part is finding a good, secure mounting location, or creating one in an older home. The only complaint is the size of the ""integrated cable routing channels"". Most HD TV's use component cable sets plus audio plus DVD component sets with audio etc. There is no way most home theater cable sets will all fit in the channels so a ""perfect"" install is really not possible. For me it was no big deal but it might be for some."
1,Review,Product is great. I already have one and bought this one for a gift. They think it is great too.
2,Expensive and doesn't work as well as the aluminum pans,My mother in law gave me this juicer and it looks WAY nicer than the old aluminum juicer that we already had. I use both of them together since we do several bushels of grapes every year. The aluminum steam juicer is much faster at processing the grapes and it keeps the steam in the bottom pan. This stainless juicer also doesn't drain the juice as well and sometimes the juice burns onto the back side of the pan. I know it's crazy but the aluminum juicer works much much better so save your money.
3,Not bad for a book I had to read.,"Steven Mintzs' Moralists and Modernizers is about three resopnses to pre- Civil War social problems in America: moral reform, social reform and radical reform. This book is about the reforms that abolished slavery, guaranteed womens rights, free public schools, educating the deaf and blind, sexual discrimination and many others. This book is about breaking up corruption, the social breakdown, doing good, virtue and liberation. This first reform in the U.S. has shaped how the U.S. is today. For a book that I had to read in college U.S. history is was not as boring as I thought it was going to be and it was quite insightful."
4,Nice present,We have talking microscope. It's great.Now we are waiting for next occasion to surprise our 5 and 8 y.o. grandsons.
3,Flag good but shipping an issue,"This was purchased as a gift and was listed as an. ""In-stock"" item. It turned out it was an ktem that had to be made and took 3-4 weeks to ship. It didn't come in fime for the birthday so fhat was a big disappointment. Fhe flag ifself was great but the wording as to availability/shipping was deceiving."
1,"Okay, time to face the truth","V.C. Andrews was not a good writer. period. I guess the books are great if you like reading the same poorly written story about kids and incest over and over. I'll admit, reading about sick stuff can be entertaining. I would suggest a true crime book about a serial killer. The writing is usually better and the content far more interesting.Come on now, how many good writers would have new ""ghost-written"" books published in their name long after they are dead? Answer: Zero."
1,Just too predictable. The same as Annie in Gates of Paradise,"I was very disappointed in this one. This book is almost the same as the ending of the Casteel series. This book is written by the ghost writer, and it seems that all of his books are just a like. It's predictable. It's so similar to Gates of Paradise, it's almost like the names were just changed.Flowers in the Attic is much better, as well as the the first three books in the Heaven series.This book is trash."
1,If Only it Worked on Mosquitos Like it Did the Dog,"This product doesn't do anything near what it advertises. It doesn't repel bugs, frankly, I think it attracts them. While it's supposed to be quiet, I did hear a high-pitched buzzing/humming noise, distractingly reminiscent of an impending migraine. My husband said it sounded like the ringing that they used as an audio effect in ""The Shining,"" and he wasn't far off.The only thing it did repel was the dog, who refused to go anywhere near it while it was on, without howling and whimpering. Exactly what we felt like doing when we got near it too. Save your money, buy some OFF!. It may stink, but it stinks less than this gizmo."
2,Hard to install batteries in,"I buy 4 Mosquito Repellers SB160 in order to use when camping.The good thing is the order is coming as quick as usual.The problem for 4 repellers is hard to put the batteries in. I try very hard, my finger nail (thumb) is broken, but I can install only 3 of the repellers.I will not refer the repeller to anyone."
4,It's pretty good.,"I laughed at this book..it has the biting sarcasm that Jimmy Fallon is really good at, that not everyone understands. I liked a lot of the phrases in here..but I wish it was longer. The pages have about one sentence per page..so the price is kind of high for it. (I still bought it...but..) this is a book mainly for the fans-or someone who wants a quick laugh. If you don't like Jimmy..save your money."
3,:),"I thought this was a really cute book and it made me laugh out loud in places, but it was really small and it was an extremely short read. I live in Canada and paid 12 bucks for it, and although it was good, I really don't think it was worth that amount. My advice? Read it, but don't buy it unless you are a Jimmy Fallon fan. :)"
4,A good introduction book for Japanese garden,"If you are a beginner of japanese garden, this is a good book to start. It introduces different garden styles and the spirit of Zen."
1,AWFUL,This is a terrible purchase. It is really flimsy and my poor child kept sliding around in it. Don't waste your money!
3,it's okay,"i found it very difficult to get the seatbelt through the back when we were getting into the taxi at the airport. there are slots for the seatbelt to wedge into and trying to do this with a line of impatient cars behind you is a little stressful! okay for emergencies, but definitely practice at home!"
3,Can be purchased for $40.00 elsewhere,This car seat can be purchased for about $40 at Buy Buy Baby in NYC. It may be worth saving over $200 (!) to call the store and order it from them directly.
2,Don't buy this,"This car seat is NOT safe enough for your precious. I used it once and will not use it again. The car seat moves easily and is not secure enough. If you are thinking of buying a car seat because of safety reasons, you should not buy this one. Why would anyone risk his/her child's safety because of convenience reasons?"
3,It's OK,"I went to visit my family in PA from FL. I didn't want to lug around my BIG carseat so bought this and used it on the airline and in the car. Well it didn't work so well on the plane. My 1 1/2 yr old was able to move alot and made the 3 hr plane ride hard because he didn't want to sit anymore and the more he moved the more the seat moved. In the car though this seat works GREAT!! He can't move, and he cannot move the seat either. This is VERY safe to use!"
1,My review of current product shipments,"I am very disappointed with the product ""Scroll Saw Workbook"" given that I ordered this product on May 17th and have NOT RECEIVED IT! I also sent numerous emails to Quality7 on this product. They never once contacted me by phone even though I left my phone number. Anyone who wishes to work with a customer who is very frustrated and can't get resolution CANNOT DO THIS VIA EMAILS. Having worked as an Software Development Director for over 38 years, I have found that there is NO replacement for direct contact with the customer. Quality7 and others that avoid this and won't offer solutions, will never be successful. I also request a full refund on this product."
4,MUST HAVE!,"If you got a gamecube, you just got to have this one. Zelda windwaker is finally complete. Thanks Amazon!"
1,amazon did not give enough info,"This is how amazon described this product...Product Features:- Exchange data between your GameCube and Game Boy Advance- Use your GBA as a supplemental controller- You can even unlock game secrets and new game levels!Well, Amazon failed to mention that the cable only works with certain gamecube games. We have 6 games, and none of them has the icon that the cable instructions says to look for. Of course, the package is now opened, so I can't even return it!Amazon should have included this important info about the cable's limitations."
5,worked like a charm!,"i bought this from marketplace seller Kandel's Korner. it's not a nintendo product, but it worked GREAT with absolutely NO PROBLEMS. i don't know what the other people who have reviewed this product did wrong, but i simply followed the directions in pokémon colosseum and now i have bayleef, croconaw and cyndaquil in my emerald game, ready for breeding and trading to diamond/pearl!"
4,link cable,Came just as described and it was exactly what our son needed to hook up his old gameboy advance to the gamecube.
5,These are great.,"For the money these are the best pipe cutters I have owned. I typically cut 1/2 and 3/4"" pvc, which they cut well. They don't spring back in the middle of a cut as many others do."
4,Interesting and insightfull,"This book is a good resource for managers trying to develop brands where experience accounts for and important portion of the value perceived by the customer.It is well structured, goes beyond the obvious."
5,works great,We have a bat problem right above our front door and this product definitely keeps them away. The sound is barely audible to people. It is mostly out of view since we have it sitting on top of a light fixture near the front door.
1,Very poor adapter,"I purchased two of these S-Video Female/RCA Male Bi-Directional Adapters. One of them only produced a black and white picture, and the other did produce a color picture but it was distorted and the colors bled. I have removed these adapters and replaced them with others which work perfectly. I did not change any cables or other connections, which proves the adapters were the problem."
3,A few problems; still useful,"The first one got smashed in shipping, and a second one was shipped. I have used it for a few months so far, 5 shirts a week. Press does not get hot enough to make steam reliably except on hottest ""linen"" setting, so I use the spray bottle. Under the cloth cover, an aluminum coating on the board wore off on the edges and brown stuff from the board oozed through the cloth cover onto my clothes, which was fixed by putting aluminum foil on the board. The hinge at the back pinches fabric and has put holes in two of my shirts. There is no marked temperature setting for ""polyester"". Still worthwhile to use; Next I will get a bigger one."
5,Great Idem,I really am glad I got this machine... It works perfectly... it is convenient and easy to store... I recommended this machine to anyone.
4,Love it but its not for everything ironed,"Great for shirts pants and other flat things but for dresses and women's blouses my wife find it a hassel and difficult. It is fast, but like other reviewers it does not hold the heat well. Three or maybe four items pressed and the steam or the iron function shuts down until you give it time to reheat so its not great if you have a lot of ironing to do. It is good to use if you are ironing something just before you get out the door. I did see this same table at a embroidery store, so it can't be that bad."
2,not recommended,"My kids LOVE the Tintin books. I have many of them. When I saw this book I thought it would be similar to Tintin. However, my kids did not like it at all. There is no comparison. Sorry!"
4,Great fun,"Hoyle Mahjongg is a great game for the mind,you know if you don't use it you lose,and so many variations I love it, the best $10.00 I ever spent."
1,Not Hoyle Majongg,"For $10 I can't complain because it is still Majongg, but the game I received has Hoyle Majongg on the box, the CD, and the splash screen along with the Encore branding, but once installed it shows that it is Mega Majongg by Inertia Software. To be honest, I felt cheated because other games from Encore who took over the Hoyle titles from Sierra are as advertised. Hoyle Casino, Hoyle Card Games, and Hoyle Puzzle Games are all produced by Encore and contain the same games that we enjoyed when Sierra produced them. I was expecting the same situation in this instance."
2,Hoyle Mahjongg not challenging enough...,"I originally was excited to get this game b/c there are so many different layouts; however, the game is not challenging what-so-ever. I was sadly disappointed. The game lets you 'shuffle' as many times as needed until you've won the game. I prefer something w/more limits, & actual levels to reach. If you want ANY type of challenge, this game is NOT one you want to buy."
4,Attractive and accurate,"Looks good, works great. Only peeve is how hard it has to be ""tapped"" to start the zero calibration."
4,"A good book, but definitelly not Chistie's best...","After getting quite tired of Hercule Poirot's character and style, it was refreshing to read a Ms. Marple novel, especially since other characters, such as Lucy, help her out, so it's not a ""standard"" Agatha Christie book (most of Hercule Poirot's books, for instance, usually have Poirot arriving in the scene after the crime, Poirot observes and talk to people, often there are an extra crime or two happening before he solves it, then he gathers the survivors and in turns puts the blame on everyone until he finds the guilty party). but there are others, such as ""And Then There Were None"" who are much better than this one..."
5,EXCELLENT!,I have read all of Christie's books and I must say I enjoyed this one the most. It was solved through actual detective work and not just some detective who percieved the solution through out. Miss Marple is my favorite of Christie's detectives and Lucy Eyelesbarrow is a very admirable young lady.
2,You can skip the 4:50,"Agatha Christie is a phenomenal crime fiction writer, however I was slightly disappointed with this novel. Miss Marple's aged, feeble detective efforts hardly impress, and the main character does not accomplish much outside of a fantastic pudding and roast.I would refer readers to other mind-bender classics such as And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express."
1,"Lets be Honest, this is a terrible Book","I am extremely disappointed with this book. I have read Agatha Christie. Here are the ones I read and liked: Appointment with Death, Hercule Poirot's Christmas, Evil under the Sun. The problem with the 4:50 is there are too many characters! I can't keep them straight. There is no plot about the timing of the train which is what I thought it would be. The only reason I finished the book was to make sense of all the time I had wasted so far. No luck there either. Even the Queen of mystery can fail miserably at times. I just wish someone had warned me. Here is your warning. Go elsewhere, maybe to Hercule Poirot novels."
5,Excellence 3/8 inch hose...,"Bought this after a cheaper PVC hose I bought from a big box store failed on first use... This is an excellent hose, much more flexible, higher quality construction... just remember it comes with 3/8 inch fittings. Highly recommended."
1,this is rediculous!!,"waiting......... waiting..... waiting some more........ why would this item even be advertised, if it wouldn't be available for several months?????????????/"
3,Not a very good book.,"In this novel, a girl named Poison lives in the Black Marshes with her father, step mother and baby sister. She sets out on an adventure to find her sister that was kidnapped by the Scarecrow. They live in a fantasy world with humans, fairies, and many other monsters that try to defeat them. Along her journey, she meets a man named Fleet who allows her to travel in his wagon. He takes her to the portal that goes into the Fairy world and decides to camp out for the night in case she turns back. So, Poison goes to the castle of the Bone Witch. I won't give too much away as to what happens next, you will just have to read for yourself.I honestly didn't like this book too much. It was pretty boring and i'm not all that in to fantasy and adventure. There were only two or three parts that were suspensful and kept me reading, but other than that I didn't enjoy it. I do not recommend this book if you don't like fantasy or adventure."
1,Do not buy this,"I have had 3 of these headsets, the first one a wire in the connection jack seperated and they no longer worked. The second one snapped in the back (i think it was a manufacturer defect). And the third and FINAL one stopped producing sound on one side entirely, I cannot figure out how to fix it, I have taken it to 2 different places to get it fixed, and they canot find anything wrong. while it looks cool save yourself money and invest in something either way cheaper or take a step up for only like $10 more."
1,This microwave is so terrible.,"... I've had this microwave for about 2 years now, and I'm glad I finally found a place to vent about it. I bought this microwave because I was thinking that the all microwaves are about the same, but this is one of the most terrible pieces of trash I've ever owned. Just to heat up water for coffee, it needs to go for a full 4 minutes. The internal dimentions are small, so I can't fit some of my plates inside it, and when I want to heat up my travel mug, I need to take out the rotating plate. Today I just realized that you can't cook at different power settings. Normally it's not something that I would thinking to look at think about when choosing a microwave, but it becomes an annoyance when you need to use it..."
4,Highly recommended. Pros and Cons.,"Highly recommended. A great read.PRO: Very well written. Nice mix of action and procedural. End twist never suspected. I learned a lot about unseen parts of London.CON: The last part of the book, leading up to the final scene, is very rushed, and out of character with the care shown in the rest of the book. Almost as though the author had to meet a deadline or word limit."
4,Enjoyable read,"Enjoyed this book, especially as it is written with the same two main characters as the first book but from the other one's perspective this time. Moves along nicely."
5,Absolute Favorite Book,I didn't expect to love this book as much as I did. I am amazed of how an abused girl got so much courage to work through all of the hardships of her life. I am so amazed that she finds so much courage and love to help others. Her spiritual guide is so amazing. She deserves 20+ stars. I am starting to read the Proud Spirit by her.I have read lots of books on this subject matter. So far this one is my absolute favorite. I could not put this down.
4,THE FRUITION OF ACCEPTING SPIRITUAL GIFTS BRINGS MIRACLES,"Rosemary Altea makes some remarkable claims in THE EAGLE AND THE ROSE, but the story of her struggle to accept and develop her skill as a spiritual counselor makes fascinating reading. Altea gives us the facts behind the TV demonstrations which have made her a popular success as a medium, and I was left wanting more case studies and less autobiographical references. That her discovery and acceptance of strange, spiritual powers has led to an improvement in her life conditions speaks volumes in favor of the healing power of this avenue of self-discovery."
5,"A powerful, soul searching book that feeds the spirit","Like humming the melody of your favorite song, this book stays with you long after you have read it. Never has a book reached inside me and grabbed hold of what I didn't understand was already there. It touched a nameless place in my heart that I now call my soul, and I am forever changed.A celestial blend of spirits, angels, gentleness and love, seasoned with piercing insights to the mind and soul, this story leaves the reader searching for their own beliefs and finding their own path to self discovery."
4,Great read,This is an excellent book but not quite as fast paced as his others.Suggest you read all of his books.
2,A glib and superficial presentation of English culture,"As an admirer of some of Leavitt's other books, I was disappointed in this novel's sloppy and inaccurate portrayal of English life in the 30s. Just having people say ""frightfully"" a lot, and call each other ""darling,"" doesn't convey the real flavor of either the country or the period; the portraits of both the upper-class and the working-class characters, and their milieus, seemed borrowed from other books (second-rate ones at that), and were little more than tired stereotypes. There were also too many American locutions in the mouths of English characters, which finally got me so annoyed that I stopped reading halfway through. Perhaps the book gets better later on, in which case I am doing it a disservice, but I felt I had given it enough of a chance."
3,A pleasant work,A reasonably well done first effort. some songs have a delightfully bluesy flavor which I think is the best use of Barbara Lane's voice and style.
2,It's An Alright Book!,I like Nan Ryan's older stuff! I don't know why but I really did like that herione! I just thought she was a jerk and I really didn't care what happened to her.
5,Serious inspiring history,"This book is simply fantastic. It is one of those few inspiring books Germanophile history-freaks cannot put down once opened.I marvel the proud warrior traditions of our ancient Germanic forbears, and it hurts to know that these traditions vanished forever with the forced Christian domination of Europe. Michael Speidels 10 year study is probably only a scratch at the surface of all the ancient and now unknown traditions all the European people had before the Christian age.Highly recommended."

1,"Poor quality, difficult to insert knife","I tried Messermeister, Blade Saver, and Wusthof.Messermeister was of the worst quality -- very hard plastic, unprocessed edges. Also it was the most difficult one to insert a knife into.Wusthof is the best. The soft inner lining is gentle on the blade. It holds tight enough, but not too tight -- it is easy to put it on/off a knife."
2,NOT A GOOD RECORDING,"I loved the Lusty, vibrant Leadbelly on my old LP. Man, his voice and that great 12-string guitar just filled the room. But this cd remastering is a flunk, sounds like a whine in an adjoining room. This is not the first disappointing cd remastering I've bought on line. But I have some great ones as well. Seems like the poor ones are a product of low remastering standards. I'm gonna stick to buying in a store."
1,Horrible mattress,We got this mattress as we were in an apartment and did not want an expensive product. very very uncomfortable. so soft that i would sink in totally making a dent. got backaches and neckaches. had to just throw it away
5,"This author is channeling a 14-year-old, I swear","How else to explain the fact that Rosemary Graham manages to inhabit the mind of a teenager in this book? And what a terrific read HIPPIE HOTEL is! I am (pretty much) grown up, and I found it hard to put down. Any young teenager would love it, too. This is the kind of story that you just fall right into, a great place to escape from the outside world. (Kind of like the Hippie Hotel in the story, come to think of it.)Janis Jaquith -- author of BIRDSEED COOKIES: A FRACTURED MEMOIR"
4,Funny gift idea...,"I did not read the book, it was bought as a gift. For my serious and sensible great aunt who is retiring this year, I gave her this book and a pair of fuzzy red slippers for Christmas. It got a good chuckle out of everyone, including her. :) And now that she's retired, she's got the time to read it and dance in her slippers..."
5,World's Best Calculator for the PE test,"Best calculator allowed for the NCEES Professional Engineers test. Does integrals, derivatives, statistics (one and two variable), Matrices, vectors, second order polynomials (the quadratic equation) and simultaneous equations. Easy to read and understand solutions for the quadratic, including the complex solution. And it costs less than $20! You can't get a better deal!"
1,SO BAD!!,"They don't deliver the righ items. I will give 1 out of 5 as a rate. Ii I could, I would give them 0 out of 5"
5,Helps avoid errors,"I agree with the views of ""Anonymous"" about this calculator. Rather than repeat what he said, I would like to point out that an important feature of this calculator is fractional input. This is important when there are complicated numerators and denominator (something like (45+ 6 sin(pi/2))/(sq root(1.006)*15.0987). Using this mode, the display type is smaller and the entire complicated fraction can be viewed in natural format. Not having a single line of type scrolling off the screen helps avoid errors. Usually, an entire complicated expression fits on a screen.This is the best scientific calculator I have ever used, and I own calculators by Casio, Sharp, TI, and HP. I do think that the ""best"" calculator of all is the TI-89."
4,quite good stuff,"it was sent in a short period of time and the quality is quite good. by the way, the package is also good."
5,Casio Calculator,"Very smart product for high school ,and to use at the begining studies of maths, engineering, phisics"
5,Best calculator ever!,This is by far one of the best calculators I've ever used it is very simple and yet very powerful... it can fool some teachers...
4,Very enjoyable,I actually liked this BETTER than Primary Colors and enjoyed seeing Stanton from a different perspective. Charlie Martin was a great character and Klein hides a great love story in the midst of two exciting campaign stories. The book benefits from the advantage of hindsight now that we can see the presidential election of 1992 and the congressional elections of 1994 in their historical contexts. I enjoyed the story a great deal and hope Klein;s next novel picks another one of the characters as the centerpiece as he did here.
4,A political junkie's fix,"I'm the first to admit I've waited for this latest work by Joe Klein. I'm a political junkie, and love to read about the inner workings of contemporary political life.Running Mate is a good read; the Great American Novel it's not, but who cares? We don't get enough political fiction (unless you count thrillers, which I don't). I devoured Primary Colors when it came out and, while waiting for Running Mate, was reduced to reading nonfiction -- Katherine Graham's autobiography -- to satisfy my need for political knowledge. Needless to say, novels are more fun to read and Running Mate does not disappoint.Another piece of political fiction I enjoyed recently was a lighthearted look at the motivations of people who get into political activism -- a novel called Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf by Asher Brauner."
1,Dreadful!,"If the upcoming Presidential election is anything like this book, God help us. This book is simply dreadful. It was hard to turn a page, let alone finish one without questioning why I invested money and, more importantly, my time into it. It was hard to follow, the writing disjointed at times, and not very fun. There was nothing educational nor entertaining about it!"
1,Tell us something we don't already know,"It's clear that Joe Klein fancies himself as the consummate political insider, but ""The Running Mate"" fails to deliver anything that might back up his claim to that throne.This book is page after excruciatingly slow page of political stereotypes and charicatures, without a solid plot line to hold it together."
1,Not Arrived,I have not yet received my textbook and the semester is half over. I am not sure it is worth keeping if I haven't been able to use it.
4,Creating Web Pages Review,"excellent books with step-by-step instructions for creating web pages. I am new to IT so am glad it's written in ""regular joe"" speak and not ""IT speak"" which is very helpful to someone like me who is making a career change."
3,Book binding was broken,"The book binding on this book was broken. Since class started the next night, my huband taped it with packing tape. There was no packaging in the box to protect the two books in it. The box was damaged during shipping as well."
4,Simpsons continues to rock,"After 10 seasons, some reviewers were lamenting about the drop in quality, but I found Season 11 to be refreshing and still a gem for the gags and provided nice (although extreme) insights into the ugly side of human nature.However, quite a number of episodes for Season 11 seemed to have contrived endings with no continuity involved any more. That is fine for the halloween episodes, but for the normal canon, it seemed to be ending due to lack of time or imagination (or both).Not having caught the later seasons, I sincerely hope it improves."
1,"A Total ""D'Oh"" in Packaging","I am w/the many others who have given this review a One Star due to packaging alone. Don't get me wrong ... I love The Simpsons! All the episodes are GREAT (and they are all new to me seeing that I haven't actually watched television since the mid 90s). But this packaging SUCKS!! I ordered from Amazon to get my season nice and early because I needed a new season fix! Little did I know that this box was one of the dreaded HEAD BOXES that don't fit in w/the other ""normal"" DVD boxes. I picked up a ""normal"" box set from Target and my Amazon HEAD box will be given as a gift. Another thing that SUCKS is how the DVDs are stored w/in the box itself (head or no head). They are just shoved in the cardboard without anything to protect them from getting scratched. Mine were already scratched when I got them. How cheap can you get? Recap: The episodes of Season 11 ROCK! The packaging SUCKS!!!!!!"
1,No More Stoopid Cases,"I just bought the latest Futurama DVD and altho nice and colorful it was the cheapest piece of crap I have ever seen. I could have printed a Futurama image on a piece of cardboard and folded it in half myself. And now it seems The simpsons DVD collections are following suit. Well...Im out. I have avoided the stupid ""collectible head"" sets all the way to season 10 and now even the standard boxes are ridiculously constructed. I am going to buy the Krusty Head box for a massive TEN DOLLARS(thats 25% for crying out loud!!)cheaper than the standard box and then I am going to buy a 96disc wallet and THROW AWAY ALL MY SIMPSONS DVD PACKAGING!!!Other than that...The Simpsons is awesome. And I absolutely love the commentaries! Keep em coming! I wonder if I could get a discount on shipping by just having the discs sent with no case..."
1,Crappy packaging!,"The packaging of this box set is one of the worst I've purchased. It's difficult to remove the DVD from the sleeves. I almost had to rip one of the sleeves to get the DVD out. It's great that they're trying to cut down on packaging, but there must be a better solution than this terrible box."
5,Simps ROCK,"I love the simpsons. I've loved the simpsons for a long time. I only have one problem. WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG TO PUBLISH THE SEASONS TO DVD??at this rate, season 20 (which is going on now, I think....) won't be published until 2018. F**K. My wife and I just baught season 11. Listen Fox video/Matt Groening, step it up PLEASE."
2,"This is why I stopped watching ""The Simpsons""....","...and only watch the first 8 seasons ( which rock by the way!). The humor takes a downhill turn in this season. Not as funny. Not as witty. Just boring, mundane and trying too hard to be funny. The ""Treehouse of Horror"" on this season even sucked which was very disappointing. Oh Well."
3,Stupid boxset!! Don't make me come in there!!!,"Like many fans, I still enjoy The Simpsons and always buy each new release of DVDs that comes out within the first three days. As some have said cerain episodes have their ups and downs. Overall the season itself is great.However, like many other people, the boxset is truly asinine. Granted Fox wants to be more eco-friendly and that is fine but, damm having the DVDs inside the folds, makes it hard to remove the DVD without scratching it.Really foolish on the part of Fox. I mean if they really want to push eco-friendly boxsets then they could have at least have used the DVD release of Benders Big Score and The Beast with the Billion Backs as a template for this boxst; at least the DVD is more easily accessible and less risk of scratching the DVD.SO in the words of Comic Book Guy.......WORST BOXSET EVER!!!!"
1,Thanks For The Honest Reviews. I Won't Be Buying This Box!,"You have to really appreciate Amazon reviews - the bitter and the better. I love The Simpson's and have bought every boxed set. However, thanks to these reliably frank reviews, I'll save my money or wait until the the cheapskates at Fox wake up and change the box. - ""It's funny 'cause it's true"" - Homer Simpson"
3,Its a good book but.....,"These are books are good but its title is misleading. The books are for everyday Kanji but not for everyday OUTSIDE JAPAN. Most of the things pertain to how to live, work, go to school, rent an apartment and grocery shop **in Japan**, so if you are looking for something that is about life in general, then this is not it. Having said that, the books are not a total waste of time and money, hence the 3 stars, especially if your goal is to someday go to Japan to live or work. They do have some good basic Kanji that can be applied to everywhere, like rice, water, bath, reading labels, certain foods, etc. So they are ok books to get the extra vocabulary in but as far applying most of it to people outside Japan, they are useless in that respect. I am liking them because I can use them for the extra input of vocabulary, as there seems to not be any Japanese books out that focus on just learning new vocabulary, sadly."
3,"Good, but outdated","This book contains excellent ideas, but it's obvious that its 13 years old. The examples are most useful for the traditional family with at-home mom. I found the cartoons and text a little too simple for my tastes. The concept bothered me a bit because the authors assume that all siblings hate each other. My kids do fight, but they are friends, too. For good ideas on raising siblings try these books: Loving Each One Best and Kid Cooperation (There's a chapter about siblings, but the whole book has ideas that are helpful when it comes to raising more than one.)and The 10 Greatest Gifts to Give Your Children (Not about siblings, but all the ideas covered do apply.)"
3,I'm not a fan,"Although I enjoy quirkiness, the characters personalities seem imcomplete or muddled at best. Didn't see much of a concept here or how different this series will be compared to what's already offered. Was only mildly amused, not impressed."
2,sound trac not very good,"as background music in the movie, seemed like a good choice, but listening to only the sound trac, nothing to brag about"
5,outstanding contribution,"Yampolsky's curatorship of the Smithsonian Folkways Music of Indonesia series reaches a new height with this release. It's probably more easy than ever to find dangdut music in America, but the selections here are standouts for their revelations about the genre. As far as I know this release also presents the only langgam jawa tracks available on CD in the US. A must-have purchase for anyone interested in Indonesian popular music of the 20th century."
1,"Eh, not as good as expected","I gave up on it, it wasn't what I expected. I might try picking it up again later. It was relatively cheap because I bought it used, so it wasn't a big loss."
2,no support,Seemed like nice nylons but provided no support so I was unable to wear them. The price was good but I am unable to comment onthe longevity of the item as their extreme looseness made them unwearable as support stockings.
4,Best of all types,"Pantyhose are always over priced, but this is the best deal for the money. Comfortable and looks nice, and last a little longer than the other brands I have tried...but pantyhose never last too long before getting runs, which is why I hate spending so much money on them!"
2,Not worth it,"I got the size A, and this size was too big for me. I wore these stocking when I was 7 months pregnant, at that time I was about 120 pounds, I'm 5'2"" (my pre-pregnancy weight is 100 lbs). The stocking were loose especially around the ankles and I got a runt in it after wearing it just once. The part that goes over my belly fit just fine. For the cost, I just don't see that these stockings are worth it. I would not recommend these hose."
4,My dog loved it,"This is the first toy that my dog brought back directly to my hand so that I could throw it again for her. The large size helped me to grab one end while the other end was in her mouth. It seems durable. This was her favorite toy for several days, although she seemed to lose interest after about 3 days. I will probably put it away for a few weeks, then bring it out again to surprise her. The squeaker inside makes almost a musical scale of noises, which delighted my dog."
3,Good but not Great,"This book is informative yet not too detailed on some calculations are done. I have to do side research on how to do certain averages and some information can be vague. This book is not for begginners, if you have a good amount of knowledge or experience, then this might be a great book, yet if you are just beggining, then it can be very confusing."
4,Electrolux canister vacuum,"I purchased this as a gift for my son and daughter-in-law. The source provider (Photoland) was prompt in their delivery, the package arrived undamaged and my daughter-in-law says she is pleased with it."
3,The Little Big Horn,A movie which captures the essence of what went on behing the scenes leading up too the devasting defeat of Custer at The Battle of The Little Bighorn. The movie contains several young actors who went on too have great careers in television & movies. It is a very suspensfull movie for its time
4,Very good cookbook,I have been extremely pleased with this cookbook. The recipes are not complicated and can be served for a weeknight dinner or a special occassion. Would love for the Birmingham JL to release another edition!
2,Wonderful Read--Publisher needs a copyeditor,"The collection of three of Miller's greatest works in volume looked too good to be true. It was. Miller's great, brusque voice is here, but the production quality of the volume is very low. The text contains far too many errors, as if it were transcribed with no proofread prior to press. Buy another edition from a more reputable company."
2,fix for dry ink problem,I had the dry ink problem also after not using for a week. I was ready to order a new cartridge but first I tried soaking the printhead in distilled water about 10 minutes. Do not soak the cartridge just the printhead. Place in about 1/8 inches of water. Now my cartridge works fine.
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,"What ever you do, don't buy this book. It is a waste of money, time, and every thing else. It's one of the worst books I've ever read. The plot, or lack there of, is pathetic, the characters are less than one dimensional, and the writing is atrocios. The author uses every vampire cliche and every southern hick cliche (the main character is in love with his niece) that exists. The book fails on every level, as a horror story, a love story, a vampire book, and especially as a readable book. DO NOT read this book, it is terrible."
5,What a nifty book,"If you like dragons, and are not into the real details about what chinese dragons can and can't do, go ahead and read this book. If you bothered by little details....what's the matter with you?"
4,Review,First time making pizzelles and this machine worked me right throught it without any problems. I followed the receipt and it came out great. The clean up was easy and we earned lots of raves for the product and the machine.
2,What am I doing wrong,I have a Villa Ware Prima Pizzelle Baker #5000.The problem is that all of the pizzelles stick to the top of the iron when I open it up. Is this the way it is suppose to work? Doesn't seem right. Also it took me awhile to realize that the light actually has nothing to do with bake time. Wish they would explain that in instructions.
4,Good product,The VillaWare Pizzelle Baker is a good product and a great value. My wife wanted a pizzelle iron like her mother's (which is probably 30 years old) and this product was almost identical. Works great and makes great pizzelles!
5,Wonderful,"What else can I say - excellent and fast shipping - a machine that's second to none. I've made over 200 pizzelles, 28 seconds for each duo, unlike the Cruisant that took 4 minutes! I'm a happy buyer."
1,Not Impressive,"Sure, its not without some charm, but seriously, there are important reasons for discarding this book. It may strike some as cogent and accesable, but to a comparativly larger number it drips with incomplete analysis and misplaced traditionalism. He's probably a good guy, and I think his fundamental points are related to good ideas, but his book's certainly not much to read. On the whole pretty unconvincing."
2,This book is a rag,"Say you take a gifted writer with no musical background, hand him a fiddle, and tell him to play ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia."" How do you think that would sound? Or the opposite: let's take a talented musician, enthusiastic but undereducated, and ask him to write a book. How would that book come out? A lot like this, obviously. The reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 star is that it was really quite interesting... interesting to ponder what sort of person would write a book like this, and what sort of person would enjoy it. My thoughts on this sort of writer: if he had been born in Afghanistan, he would be Taliban. But instead he was born here, so he spouts off about Jesus and Patriotism. Thank God this is still a free country and folks like this can't tell the rest of us how to live! Keep your fingers on that fiddle Charlie, but please don't write anything but your grocery list ever again."
5,Worked When Bissell Shampoo Failed,"Our yellow lab became ill, and uncharacteristically urinated in my home office. I tried to remove it several times with Bissell's pre-cleaning spray and shampoo, both for pet stains, without success. I was afraid that I'd inadvertently set the stains. I decided to try this product after reading the reviews. My experience was just as positive; it totally removed the stain and odor. The carpet looks great. It's by no means limited to just pet problems; it's a great general purpose carpet shampoo. Also, if you have any questions, their customer service is great."
4,dated but interesting how-to,"A how-to book covering various hobbies, some of it is outdated but can still make a good start for the beginning hobbyist. The ham radio section is probably the least useful by modern standards, as regars the equipment discussed."
3,Works best when sitting on the couch...,"I purchased this monitor because I wanted to check my heart rate while exercising, and it was much cheaper than the kinds with the chest strap and watch. However, it seems that there are a lot of things that interfere with the monitor reading your pulse. Specifically, mine will not read accurately if I am moving at all. It is difficult to check your pulse when exercising if you have to completely stop moving first. Even when I'm stopped, sometimes I cannot get my finger positioned just right on the pad, and I can see that it is reading my pulse erratically (there is a little heart that flashes.)If you only want to check your pulse occasionally, and you are a patient person, this might be the right monitor for you. If you want to monitor your pulse more closely during exercise, you may be happier with the traditional chest strap models. In the end I wound up buying one of those, and I'm much happier with it."
3,Tachycardia check-ins,"Useful to me to check my heart rate at various times during the day. Have to be still to get a reading, so not useful if walking, biking etc. But for the price, worth it to me."
4,"Blues By Roosevelt ""The Honeydripper"" Sykes","Approximately 39 min. Digitally remastered. This is a prime example of blues shouter Roosevelt Sykes in all his glory. Recorded in 1961,not much else is known about the session. Interestingly,this album was produced by Memphis Slim,who also recorded for Folkways Records. Sykes is in fine form with his powerful vocal style and his always lively piano work. The tracks are paced very nicely and of course it wouldn't be a Sykes recording session without an instrumental (R.S.Stomp) to really liven things up. There is probably no other blues singer-piano player who seemed to put out so much electricity in everything he recorded,and this is no exception. Even old work-horses like Sweet Old Chicago or 44 Blues get the ""Honeydripper"" treatment. If you are looking for an example of post-war blues by a solo singer-piano player-look no further. This is the real deal."
1,NO! This man is a fake,"Not that I believe everything 60 Minutes reports on, but their February 7, 1999 report on this man makes clear (through photographs and difficult questions) that Wilkimarksi is a liar. Men like Frankl and Wiesel actually experienced the Holocaust; Wilkimarski (sorry about the spelling) is a fake and should NOT be supported."
5,Great corn popper,"It was a Christmas gift for my son, daughter---n-law and grandsons gift and I have been told they love it..."
5,awsome,i think its awsome make perfectly good popcorn!!! and its great for the kids!!![[ASIN:B0001V48KG Nostalgia KPM-508 Old-Fashioned Kettle Popcorn Maker
2,DEEPLY UNSATISFIED!!!,"Item came 14 days late, damaged (not from shipping), and still no word of them shipping another one to me. It has now been 26 days since my complaint to them via e-mail, and nothing has been resolved. Never doing business with this company again!update:I was sent a second machine after a couple of weeks. this one also needs to be sent back because they gave me a used one. It's dirty, rusted, scratched and I'm really upset.Update September 22nd 2005: It has now been 3 whole months. My complaints are still not resolved. I told the company the second one they sent me is a used one (I paid for a new one) and they told me everything would be taken care of. It's not. Dont buy from this company if good service is what you expect."
1,It just plain did not work.,This item was purchased as a Christmas present for my father.It simply did not work. Burned the popcorn without popping more than a handful of corn. Our guess was that it does not get hot enough to actually pop the corn - but does get hot enough that it will burn it after enough time.The item was returned for a full refund.
1,Plexi Glass put on backwards,"I received this product as a gift and the crank is supposed go on the right side of the machine but the hole for the crank is on the left side. The basket won't fit in backwards so I'm stuck with trying to tip the basket by hand which is not a good idea. Machine also looks like it was put together very cheap, especially the caulking which is very un-professional. Would def not recommend."
1,"NOT ALL THERE, VERY DISAPPOINTED","The popcorn maker looks great, and was very excited to get it up and running... only to realize that the crank (shown in the picture as the lever with the red ball at the end of it) was not in the package and no where to be found. Exremely disappointed I would stay away from this product."
4,popcorn popper,"The door is somewhat hard to open. For the price, we like it a lot. We love the sound of popping corn and we have popcorn almost nightly. It is less expensive than microwave and better."
3,Average biography,There is not much in this book that I have not read before in other books. I found the organization to be a little confusing and repetitive. One of the timelines also gives the date of Hitler's suicide as 3 weeks after the end of WW2.
1,Too difficult if you have no previous knowledge of Ada 95,Book to difficult for readers heaving no previous knowledge of Ada 95 - even with some programming experience in other languages such as C++.
1,very bad,"An awful book. I could barely understand anything, as no examples were complete. The object oriented section was incomprehensible at all. I would recommend leaving this book aside and get a real Ada teaching book. ( )"
2,Unsuitable for an introduction to Ada 95.,"This book was used for an introductory course on Ada 95. Big Mistake! It may be more useful for intermediate students studying the language. The author's use of code fragments does not convey how to code complete programs. I got a better understanding about Ada by examining the completed programs provided on the enclosed CD-ROM, which, by the way, came mostly from the Feldman book. Barnes only provides six complete programs of his own. It is like, ""Here are code fragments with obtuse explanations for why they are right or wrong and here are six lengthy complete programs to show how creative I can be"".To make the language more relevant, provide real-world examples. Explaining the machinations of the Ada compiler would be also helpful."
3,Needs a lot of light,"The scale is excellent when it does work. The readings are consistent, and quick. However, the lighting in my bathroom is not sufficient to power this scale most of the time. I would have to hold the scale up to the light to let it charge up the solar batteries before I can use it. Keep that in mind when making this purchase."
3,"Easy to replace, but not as effective","One of the easiest to replace filters, but according to a older Consumer Reports review, it wasn't one of the more effective models."
3,Bad science,"The good:A lot of information and opinion about the short game in one place.The bad:Bad science. Example: a table (Figure 2.8.1, p. 20) showing data results expressed to tenths of a percent, based on a sample of five players!Inflated. The useful information could have been presented in about 10% of the book's 429 pages.Flagrant salesmanship. Items offered for sale include The Pelz Report, Dave Pelz Scoring Game Schools, Dave Pelz Scoring Game Tour, and thirteen different ""learning aids.""Shameless self-aggrandizement.Not user-friendly. Example: no index."
5,A must have...,Any serious golfer must read this book. Without it we are just guessing and not playing with intent. This book does take all the guesswork out of it and allows you to build your confidence. It has done wonders for my short game and my overall scores. I wish I had read it earlier.
5,Enjoyment from golf,"If you would like to enjoy your golf better by getting into more scoring positions, this book will help you. If you enjoy the feeling of pitching balls effortlessly next to the pin, this is a must."
1,MORONIC CUSTOMER SERVICE,Easy Spirit Women's Racearound Slip-On ShoesSadly this company's internet service department has a total IQ of zero - they could not even fulfill the simplest request - We will never contact them again.
3,"Good statistics, mediocre execution","Pelz's method is a little too mechanical. The short game needs good mechanics but with more emphasis on instinct and feel. Pelz's ""dead hands"" philosophy is not something I want in such a feel-based thing as the short game. You don't have dead or passive hands when you swing a tennis racket or baseball bat, and you shouldn't when swinging a golf club either. But I do like Pelz's clock positions. And I think he did a great job in compiling his statistics."
5,Excellent teacher,What a masterful book. In trying Dave's techniques my game has gotten better. I now have a very repeatible chip and pitch swing. His concept of a finesse swing is great. I have used the finesse swing on many irons and now have many more options for yardage. Formerly I would pick the closest club for the job and go. Now depending on the lie and landing area I can choose my best option. His explanations helped me to better understand his techniques. Illustrations are good. I recommend this book.
4,A must read for any golfer.,"You'll learn a great deal about the short game and will apply key ideas into your game. I now have three distances for each of my wedges, when I used to have only one. Thanks Dave for those instructions."
1,Waste of Money,"This book is full of self-congratulatory remarks, name dropping, and product promotion. There is some good information in the book but you will need to look hard for it. Overall I would estimate about 50 out of the 426 pages are useful (about 20%). That's why I gave it one star."
1,american telecom junk phone sys.,"over a period of 14 months american telecom has replaced my phone system four times. ra218 and ra2364. the longest lasting went for 60 day before crashing,always the base unit goes bad.buyer beware"
3,Keeps your doggie warm,"After trying many different types of coats and then this one. I have to say this one covers more of you dogs torso than most coats, thus, keeping them warmer. It does have some minor drawbacks. To put it on,one has to put the feet through the arms holes first then flip the coat over the dogs head, then attach the velcro underneath. I found the shoulders a bit snug on my dog but on others it may not be. It does seem to look a might funny, more like human clothes on a dog than dog clothes on a dog. But it does keep them warmer than most of the jacket-types I have for my dog. It is washable, and this is always a nice feature for dog wear. If warmth is what you want and not a fashion statement then I say go with this item!"
2,excellent writer but,"his main character has nothing to hold my interest. He needs work, something to give him a spark. I think I'll stick to Elvis/Joe Pike and Jack Reacher."
5,Sharpie Killers,"This pens are absolutely amazing. They dry extremely fast, they write on basically anything and they are extremely permanent. I have used these pens for four years and they are by far better than Sharpies in every sense."
2,Thumbs Down,"Heinlein, best known for his science fiction, was over his head in the fantasy genre. He has many die-hard fans that are loath to criticize any of his stories, but believe me, the fantasy is second rate at best. Try Jack Vances Lyonesse trilogy for high fantasy at its best."
4,Feel the Magic,"Half Magic is about a magic penny that grants half wishes. The penny came from an ancient temple. You need to wish for twice as much as you want to get the whole wish. But most of the time you get half wishes. Before you wish, you need to think seriously about what you want. That way you have a better chance of getting your whole wish granted.Half Magic is about magic and adventure. The main characters go on many adventures because of the penny. Four children go on three main journeys. They go to a desert, medieval times, and one of the kids changes families!I believe that Half Magic is a unique book because the magic is powerful and special. I also like the adventure. My favorite part in Half Magic was when they go to medieval times!"
5,Half Magic,Half Magic is about four kids who find a magic coin.Only it works by havles so you have to wish double the amont you want of some thing. They many adventures.If you enjoy books about magic you will like Half Magic! If you enjoy Half Magic read 7 Day magic.
3,half magic review,"This a great book. I liked the creativity that the author put into the story. i thought that it was a story that younger kids would like more, compared to older kids."
5,Delightful!,"Every child needs to have been read ""Half Magic"" aloud before they grow too old to stop believing- and if the parent's funny voices are expressive enough, and the child is willing, they will /never/ stop believing in magic. The delightful children (Jane, the adventerous one; Mark, the solid one; Katherine, the dreamer; and Martha, the little terror) never stop entertaining, with their wild experiences with magic in halves.In my opinion, the very first Edward Eager book to be read should be ""Half Magic""; it's adorable, and books such as ""Magic by the Lake"" and ""Knight's Castle"" will certainly be appreciated more if preceded by this one."
4,A terrific book full of fantasy and lots of imagination.,"I read this book originally when I was in grade school - 20 years later, I still have a copy of it. This is a wonderful fantasy where you don't have to settle for everyday things. Once you figure out the logic of the magic coin. My children are now enjoying this book"
1,This truly is one of Eager's poorist work!,"The book made absoulutely no sense! I hated it! Mark, katherine, Martha and Jane were poorly chosen characters that obviously didn't know what the were doing. And the ending about the little girl and the baby didn't make any sense. I DON'T RECOMEND THIS BOOK!"
5,Invaluable advice,"This book is similar in content to Ogilvy's other masterpiece, ""Ogilvy on Advertising"", but with more emphasis on the sales aspects of the advertising business. ""Confessions"" is also more autobiographical. Ogilvy's stories about his background, building his agency, and dealing with clients are fascinating.Given Ogilvy's talent as a copywriter, the book is obviously a pleasure to read. For example--""How do you decide what kind of image to build? There is no short answer: Research cannot help you much here. You have to actually got to use judgment. (I notice increasing reluctance on the part of marketing executives to use judgment; they are coming to rely too much on research, and they use it as a drunkard uses a lamp post, for support rather than for illumination.)""Anyone engaged in any aspect of advertising, marketing, or top level management should get plenty out of this book. It's a how-to manual for total success."
1,Filled with ommisions and inaccuracies,"I'm not sure if this is a officially licensed poster, if it is it's horribly done. There are numerous errors and ommisions. For example, Champ Bear was yellow, not blue. For a serious Care Bear collector this isn't worth the paper it's printed on. If this is for a child who has no idea what Care Bears are or their history, then it's just a substandard decoration. I mean come on, key original Care Bears are missing and the likes of America Bear is included, what a joke."
2,Hardly Worth the Effort,"""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" takes its formula from the ""quest"" genre. It's essentially the myth of the hero, and our interest depends on the novelty of the adventures or trials our hero undertakes. Quest stories also seem to depend on the hero's naiveté, which often borders or crosses the line into all out stupidity. ""Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" is no exception. The problem is the quest doesn't seem all that important, and the outcome is a set-up without the thrill of discovery. We learn a few tricks along the way, get a picture of an India few of us will ever see, but it's hardly worth the trip. ""Sorcerer,"" also seems to be a misnomer implying wonders greater than any revealed. There are better examples of its type, (any of the Carlos Castaneda series,) and you could probably find one set in India. I'd say to skip this one."
1,my review,"I saw this at a friends house and it was a very stupid movie.so if you have any sense, unless you buying it for a 3 year old don't buy it."
2,Not Worth It!,"I am a public administration student in a top ranked gradute program. This book was one course's required textbook and only because the editior, Anthony Kovner, was the instructor. While few students enjoyed the course, no one felt that this book is worth purchase. The only people that I would recommend this book to are foreign graduate students who have no working knowledge whatsoever about the US healthcare system. Otherwise, there are numerous books on the market that are cheaper and much more informative and intellectual."
1,piece of junk,"It tells your weight, accurately to within 100 pounds or so, depending on how you stand. No instructions on how to stop the wild fluctuations, and differences of as much as 20 pounds even when you're trying to stand in the exact same way. If I wanted to know that I weigh between 150 and 250, I would have looked in the mirror. Total garbage."
1,CHINGY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"CHINGY SUCKS BECAUSE HE LEFT DTP.IF HE DID NOT LEFT DTP THIS ALBUM SHOULD BE BETTER.POWERBALLIN' HAS LOTS OF STUPID TRACKS LIKE BALLA BABY REMIX,BALLA BABY,FALL-N,AND MORE!!! I DON'T KNOW WHY SOME PEOPLE LIKE THIS ALBUM.I WISH CHINGY IS DEAD BY A CAR ACCIDENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,WHY? I MEAN WHY?,"I could not believe Chingy came out with another album I thought he was done after his debut because both these albums suck beyond believe. The people that like this kind of pop are young white girls that think this s**t is cool. I hope no real fan of hip hop bought this album and if you did then shame of you for supporting this kind of pop music. Anyways do not buy this garbage support the new album from Ghostface called ""Fishscale""."
1,Everything you might need to know about this generic rapper.,"""Ey yo, err1 nos who I iz, I pimp hoez.Makin' munny wit my fellas makes people juz jealous.I got escalade, so u wanna hate, well u gon fade,blow!... Dat's wat my AK juz said.From hurr to thurr i'm supurrb, so lemme lite dis hurrb to smoke sum, while i drinks hennessey str8 from da tennessee!""The one and only story he needed to tell you went something like that. Did someone call him a good storyteller?Support some real hip hop!"
1,Please stop offending my ears,"One reviewer wrote that Chingy used ""an old school stlye"" in this current album. Chingy wouldn't know what old school was even if I slapped him with a Rakim Allah cd. Chingy is wack as hell. What's even more wack is the battle of the wack between him and Nelly. I would rather see two 6 year olds fight than hear this war of unlyrical lyrics and infantile subject matter."
1,thanks to chingy....i have a earache,"this album is terrible!!!!! when are people going to realise that artist like chingy rap about the same crap over and over again.... he has no originality whatsoever...maybe if he stayed with DTP he would have ad a better 2nd disc (i did say maybe)... for crying out loud he sounds like a 4th grader!!!!!!the only reason i would pick this lackluster is because janet jackson is on it... i am a huge fan of hers...im tired of these magazines giving chingy 3 or 4 stars out of 5 just because he has a pretty face... pretty boys will lose their looks ladies (sorry if you did not know that)...if the world wants true rap music to survive, dont buy this crap...."
1,Booooo!,"Chingy go hang yourself. Please. I swear this cd sets African Americnas back 50 years. Any female rapper could shut you up, your flow sucks, your lyrics make me sick and please go back to English and learn the language.. Right Thurrr? ok hold on :throws up on the keyboard:"
1,"This guy actually has a record deal?? If there were negitive stars, this would be the album to get it","Chingy is the worse excuse for hip-hop that I have ever heard. Cliche lyrics that could be written by a forth grader, horrid beats and sampling, and a voice that would make the deaf run for cover, this album gets my vote for worse album of all time. Yes, worse then albums made by Don Johnson and Bruce Willis. Worse then anything from Blink 182 or Fall out Boy, even worse then 50cents latest nightmare. I would even say that Milli Villi would be considered a classic to the mess. If you want bad hip-hop, this is the CD you have been looking for. Shame on you Capital records for wasting studio time and money, along with other artist that would probely dropped to sing you no-talented skinny, a**. Shame on you who support this garbage, and put money into his pockets. Then again judging from the way he is dressed on this album, he might could use the money to buy some new clothes."
1,This album was pretty Wack!!!,"There is only 2 songs that i liked of this album, and the rest sucked big time.he is so dumb for leaving DTP, expecially after the success of jackpot. this album went str8t Flop, did'nt go no where!!!"
1,"Lousy, generic mainstream hip-hop","""Powerballin'"" lacks the infectious jams that Chingy's debut ""Jackpot"" had, and that spells trouble for Chingy. That's about all that this run-of-the-mill St. Louis rapper has going for him. If he can't re-create any party jams like ""Right Thurr"", Chingy won't last much longer. Leaving Disturbing Tha Peace was Chingy's biggest mistake, as Ludacris was the man responsible for making Chingy pop radio's ""flavour of the month"".His lyrics are just too generic and played-out already, the same topics of women, clothes, money and cars overrun ""Powerballin'"". The production lacks any punch at all - it's all about sugar-coated pop beats with Chingy. He's just another unoriginal rapper that comes along once in a while, and is forgotten about not much later. He even had to bite Nelly's type of slang (Nelly of all people), another sign of Chingy's lack of originality. If Chingy can't come up with something that hasn't been done before, he won't last much longer."
1,Worst Rapper ever,"chingy, you are the worst rappper ever. all you rap about is women and bling.2pac has never rapped about how rich he is.Why do u think Ludacris dropped you from his label. Because YOU SUCK. Believe me, 2 years from now, I'll see u in the Mcdonalds near my house with your best buddy,Mike Jones. if u wanna keep your job:rap about how bad it was growing up.St. Louis has crappy rappers"
1,B**** like Chingay need to give up!,"People who give this album four or five stars don't know nothing about rap, do you call this rap? it's just some party songs and some songs about girls, that's it. how can you say it's a good rap cd. THIS IS NOT RAP. THIS IS POP. THIS IS A JOKE. So called ""rappers"" like Chingay are a discrace to hip-hop. They just need to put down the mic and let the real rappers, the big dogs of the rap game to do this rap s***.OUTLAW"
5,thats what friendships are about,this book is one of the best graphic novels i've read. i liked the drawings a lot. simple but spicific. i liked the friendship between black and white. and the freindship between the two kids and chocolate the gangster. i recomend it very much
3,"Starts slow, but a good ending.","The book itself arrived quickly in perfect condition save for 1 small ink splotch on one page toward the end of the book. I'd say that's probably something that happenned in printing. The story was pretty good but I had a hard time getting into it til' I was over halfway through it. Not at all what I'd call a spell-binder. Once it fianlly took off it got pretty good, though much of the ending was fairly predictable. I like Tom Clancy and on the advice of a co-worker I am checking out Vince Flynn. This is my first Flynn novel. I have now started reading ""Transfer of Power"" and it has a much better beginning."
4,What a concept,"Vince Flynn has re-energized the political thriller genre with this gem by making it so much fun to read. The stroy begins with former commandos killing three politicians that are corrupt, which is quite an interesting concept. The SEALS feel they have ruined America and deserved to be taken out -- literally. It all provides the ironic backdrop for the climax as other shady characters try to take advantage of these deaths.Flynn writes with as much knowledge and as much exlosiveness as David Baldacci and Brad Meltzer, but I did feel he gave away the ending well in advance. His characters, particularly the political figures, were so real and portrayed so accurately that parts were almost laugh out loud funny. Gee, I wonder who the drunk, gray-haired senator that gets whacked might have been?With other bestsellers already on the shelves it is clear Flynn will be a force in this area for a long time. If his other books are as good as this one, his future is bright."
4,I hope this doesn't really go on!,"This is my first time reading Vince Flynn and was quite impressed. The story moves along a at quick pace and is really quite disturbing!Character development really picked up for me in the second part of the book. If even 25% of the subject matter in term limits was non-fiction, it would be enough to keep me up at night!Thank goodness for fiction. Anxious to start Memorial Day!"
4,Term Limits - Damaged CD,"The book was excellent, however, one of the CDs was damaged. I didn't expect this in a new product. We were amazed at how Vince Flynn's story so mirrored the current Congress and Presidential administration."
4,Term Limits,"Very interesting book involving politics, assasinations and intrigue. Based on our current political atmosphere Vince Flynn may have figured out the real way to get change (maybe the only way)in Washington."
4,SIMILAR TO 24,I finished this on 12142007. A good book but not up to Tom Clancy's early novels. I found the plot to be similar to the television program 24 which does not mean it is a rip-off of the program. The book was published in 1997 so a case could be made that the writers/producers of 24 were influenced by this book. I liked the book and wanted to start with this one since this is Vince Flynn's first published novel. I plan on reading all of his stuff.For those reviewers who gave Mr. Flynn a thumbs down due to no minority - read black - characters or too many killings of prominent politicians and/or the lack of sympathy for their deaths; well - people need to remember this is a novel and it is the authors choice on where he wants to take the story. I recommend this book to those who like thrillers and who are sick and tired of PC.
5,Term Limits,"Great book! I am now reading his first, American Assassin and it starts at the beginning of how Mitch Rapp first became involved in this line of work."
5,Another great one from Vince Flynn,"While Mitch Rapp wasn't in this story, it was still a thriller from start to finish. There were some familiar characters from the Mitch Rapp series, but Flynn developed some other strong characters to ""get the job done"". The story fit into a familiar situation with the partisanship, bickering, and deficit spending that we're all familiar with from our ""leaderS"" in Washington DC. This is one of my top 3 favorites from Vince Flynn."
4,My first Flynn book,"I enjoyed term limits, and will read more Flynn books, it was not however quite as gripping as some of my other favorite authors (Coban, Child). Term Limits is a good plot, with some originality."
5,Term Limits is the embodiment of literary excellence,"The plot for this book is reason enough to read it. With the political cauldron boiling with politicians intent on restoring prestige and prosperity to the American People as well as their nemisees... corrupt politicians with only personal gain and self-interests in mind, action and drama combine to captivate the reader from the start. The moral stature of the characters is well defined yet the predictability that would usually be found in such a plot is nowhere to be seen. This is amongst the best books I've ever read. I find this author to be comprable to David Baldacci and Nelson Deville."
4,"Explosive, you won't put it down","I love political thrillers. And this one was first rate. Michale O'rouke( protagonist) was a truly likable character. It was a lot like the NBC show the West Wing, only it was good and there were terrorists"
1,A waste of time.,"400 pages of unbelievable, awkward reading. From the unrealistic ""address the nation"" presidential speeches, to the virtually glitch-free assassinations (wasn't there anyone walking around DC those days?) this book had me shaking my head all the way through."
3,"Not bad for a first novel, but...","- Too long. Jesus, so much could have been deleted.- A congressman as a special operator that covers up murders. Uh-huh. Little too much."
2,"An adult plot, written for juveniles","I purchased this book because of the 4-star rating on Amazon. Next time I will need to take the time to actually read the reviews, but I don't know if that would have helped. The most important criteria for me when judging a book is the writing style and level of intelligence of the prose and especially the dialog. This book fails miserably at that so I give it one star in that area. It reads like a novel for teenagers, while having too much violence and a political storyline that has no appeal for that age group. Another star for an interesting premise, or plot, but I don't agree with the author's basic ideology.Granted this is Vince Flynn's first book, and I will give him the benefit of that fact. I hope his subsequent novels are more mature."
4,Term Limits,The first time I have read Vince Flynn. This book so mirrors todays goverment it was uncanny. I really enjoyed it and will read more of Vince Flynns books.
5,Loved It!,"I loved this book, it really offers a deep look at the world of politics in Washington. It made me sick to realize this kind of stuff probably happens every day. It was a super quick read for me, I was so engrossed I just lost track of time. I highly recommend it. It's a great alternative to TV and more exciting!"
5,Full of suspense. Very exciting.,"I enjoyed this book. The suspense began the minute the book opened and continued to the end.Although I don't see this book as being realistic, I thought that only added to the enjoyment of reading this story. (sometimes too realistic is not fun!) The characters are fully developed and the reader is able to see their thoughts as they develop, which only adds to the plot.I appreciated the 'innocent' type of outlook Michael has about his job. It only added to the excitement as he struggles to learn what exactly is happening.enjoy."
3,thriller,"I must admit I got hold of this book at a special price in our local bookshop and I gave it a try and have not regretted that. Since than I have been going 'round looking for Vince Flynn books. This book started a little slow at first but once it picks up the pace , you will never want to put it down until you finish the book. In fact I have lost some sleep reading it. This is I think his first novel. I managed to get hold of his next one ""transfer of Power"" and it was even better with great improvement in Flynn's writing. Exciting right from page one. I have also learned something about the control of power in the US from reading this book. Vince Flynn has found a place in my library alongside authors such as Michael Connelly, Stephen Hunter, Lee Child, Harlan Coben, Wilbur Smith and many more."
4,A GOOD PERK....,"for the money. I really wanted a Regalware because of the stainless steel. The West Bend 58002 is made by Regalware but it is made of Aluminum and about 1/2 price. Short safe cord. Easy to clean. Spout Locks for continious pouring or bends back for single pour. Light comes on when coffee is perked. 2 & 1/2 cups of Percolator Grind Bean makes a nice 42 cups of coffee, but I use just a little more bean. Does not use a filter! Coffee comes out HOT and stays HOT as long as you leave the Urn pluged up. I like it better than I thought I would. I might have paid a couple dollars more by using Amazon but Amazon is one of the best and safest retailers on the 'net."
3,Works fine if it arrives with all the pieces!,"My job requires that we host several large events every year. We bought one of these and it worked great, so we bought 5 more since our next upcoming event was very large (500+ people).Turns out 1 of the 5 we ordered arrived without the power cord in the box. Very annoying! We didn't open the boxes until the day before the event, so we didn't have time to return the item. We ended up just brewing one, then swapping the power cord to the one that was missing its own. It worked, but was less efficient than I would've liked.I would've given 5 stars if not for the missing parts, because the ones that do arrive intact work great considering how cheap they are."
1,Pre-Damaged Item Shipped to Me,"Upon opening my box from amazon, I found that this item was damaged BEFORE it was boxed up and shipped to me. The original box of the item had already been opened, and the entire base of the item was damaged. On top of that, a note was attached stating ""please damage out."" Unfortunately, the person who boxed this item overlooked the defective piece and shipped it to me anyway. I was very disappointed to have to go through the hassle of returning this item."
4,Good product,The coffee urn is very good and reliable. The only problems is the power cord is very short and needs an extention cord to fit into most outlets.
2,"Use with caution, fanboy","Yeah, so this is kind of the red-headed stepchild of Ravnloft 3rd Edition. It has some pretty nice tidbits in it: I liked a few of the prestige classes and most of the feats. However a lot of what is presented here comes off hammy and two-fisted, and there are some widgets in here guaranteed to unballance your game. There's a smattering of good stuff here on secret societies and what not, but with the exception of the Fraternity of Shadows (which I think was covered already in Van Richten's Arsenal, Vol 1.) it's all retreds of 2nd Edition stuff. Fanboys, if you wand good 2nd Edition material, go on eBay and spend the scheckles to buy the source material. Why settle for two pages of Carnival when you could own the whole thing (and a much better supplement THAT is)."
2,Disappointed,"I was not pleased at all with the quality, fit or design of the slip. It looked very cheap and didn't hang well. I've never worn it. Maybe I can use it for a craft project."
3,"comfort, but not enough support","I own several other Vanity Fair bras, and really liked them, so I figured I'd give this one a try. The material was very comfortable, but I didn't feel I got much support from it. The adjustable part of the strap isn't very long, so I couldn't shorten the straps enough. When you add the stretchy fabric in the straps, I was not being held in place much at all. Maybe if I worked a desk job, this would be okay, but I'm relatively active, on my feet and moving most of the day, and this bra didn't cut it."
4,Bad BAD Ronald!,"Like many people I had seen the 70's TV Movie but never read the book. I think there was only one printing of the original paperback, which accounts for the steep prices as it has become a cult favorite. I do not want to spoil anything but will warn you the book is far darker than the toned down TV movie. Ronald is really really bad!For example (spoiler alert), the original crime that forces Ronald to hide in his own house, in the movie, is an accident. In the book not only is it not an accident but he rapes the girl first and she is only 11 years old.In Vance's depiction of Ronald, he still manages to make you feel some sympathy for him. Though he manages to blame his victims in his own mind and reeks a lot more mayhem before the anti climatic ending. It is a page turner and I think the whole concept, of a murderer hiding in your house, is wonderfully creepy."
4,The Blue Butterfly,"An excellent family film that follows a few months in the life of a young boy that has cancer of the brain. His lifes ambition is to catch a special blue butterfly. He and his mother try to enlist the aid of a leading entimologist to go to the rain forest with them to find it before the boy dies. He has spent most of his life restricted by his condition and yet he has built an amazing collection from those limited resources. The adventure in the rain forest that is teaming with all kinds of flora and fauna is inspiring and shows one of lifes miracles as both the boys attitude about all life and his life are changed in a profound way. William Hurt and the rest the cast do an excellent job. The camera work in the rain forest is incredible. Good music for background. Great quality DVD with excellent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Fly Away Home"".CA Luster"
4,Historic songs and Good Words,"Forty years later it is too easy to forget or too easy to have missed the courage and passion that fueled the Civil Rights movement. While America is still far from perfect, it is a better nation for all its citizens because some citizens took great risks for high principles in the years from 1954 through 1965. Our pledge speaks of ""one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all"" the inspiration provided by these songs and sermons helped make this a truer statement than it ever was before.Everyone who is proud to be an American should own and listen to this CD."
2,Subscribe and Save delivers OLD bags of mix! Two thumbs down,"I've subscribed to receive Pamela's GF cookie mix and after the second delivery of OLD mixes I am returning to buying them in the store. All of the last mixes during the last several months (6 bags per order x 2 = 12) have been OLD -- not expired, but the chocolate is dried up, light brown and crumbles to a powder. I discovered it's not possible to return a subscribe 'n save order (for some reason) so I have to throw out the chocolate chips and use Ghiradelli instead. Whenever I have bought Pamela's from Whole Foods the chocolate in the mix has been dark brown, fresh and never has crumbled to powder.AVOID subscribe and save on this item. Buy them in a store."
3,Thank you Rode!,"I've tried the different settings and I've come to conclude that -10 DB is the best setting. I'm using a Canon HV30 with this mic. I can't find anything wrong with it, it works great... I do however think that the instructions should be a little more informative. Describe the settings and what they do. 0 I assume is regular pick-up, -10db cuts 10db of noise distortion from the mic and so on... at least that's how it seems to be working. All in All I'm going 3 stars, mainly because of the lack of details for new users in the instructions. Thank You though for a great product!As a follow up I would have to say that since I've been using my camera I haven't really used this mic. It is very nice, but I don't really need it. Once in a while I'll use it to film outdoors. The on-board camera on my HV30 works just as well for the filming I do."
4,Quick shipping. Everything was in order.,The Mic is what I expected. I am using it on a canon t3i and on a zoom h2n audio recorder. Everything seems to be working fine and it sounds great.
4,Useful,Has helped us to do a number of interviews with pro sound quality without having to wire the subjects up with a lav mic
4,Can't beat the quality for price relationship,"I needed a shot gun microphone to fit the hot shoe of the Canon HG10. I am shooting a documentary and needed to interview folks in loud surroundings. This was the most valuable and important upgrade to my camera. The sound difference is unprecedented for the price. For $149 the mic comes with a build on rocker (so you don't get all the bump noise) and can be adjusted to avoid the truncation of the peaks of your sound waves. The mic comes ready to use, but I would suggest changing the volume to -10dbz to combat this problem. You get a clean sound, but the cord attaches to the camera with a short earpiece jack. You cannot extend this mic out on a boom or you would get buzz and hum. For the average user and camera mounting, this camera is perfect.It does not overwhelm the profile of the camera and is very light. I would suggest that you buy 1 along with a 9 volt battery (not included). It seems like a steal."
4,rode videomic,"i have only used it once, but it made a huge difference in the audio. i use the nikon d7000 and just shot a short film with kids. all the voices were picked up very well. not much noise."
2,Not sold on the construction,"After opening this package, I didn't even bother testing out the sound quality on the mic. While others may be more gentle with their equipment, I knew that this would be destroyed in a matter of weeks with me. It seems extremely flimsy and overly bulky. Additionally, if you plan on taking still images with this attached you'll have to use the large lcd viewfinder as the small viewfinder is obstructed by the mic housing. This thing is enormous. Sent it back immediately and purchased the videomicpro. The return process was fantastic by the way."
1,Too subjective !!!,"If only Mr Timmerman had tried to know who Jacques Chirac really is, why he thinks with his heart rather than his wallet, and what his values are, he would have got the issue.Living in a country for years does not make you more open-minded as long as you go on thinking the same way. Trying to understand others, Mr timmerman, means being able to think their ways, certainly not the way you would like them to think."
1,No mention of Saddam's deadly Anfal Campaign,"The one he committed against the Iraqi Kurds (killing 182,000 Kurds in just one year). The author talks of hundreds of Kurds getting killed by insurection forces in Iraq more recently with no mention of the much larger deadly campaign.On other matters the author refers to 1951 as the year of The Ten Commandments film starring Charlton Heston. Actually the Ten Commandments was released in 1956 and was made only after 1951.Back to Saddam she does mention him going to big war with Iran but tries to possibly blame the USA for the war. Ms. Rossi, Carter, the weakest president the uSA ever had (and one of the most pacifistic) was in office when Saddam started his war with Iran. Doubtful Carter could've stopped any war between the Middle East countries. Even more doubtful Carter's government caused it either. Saddam creepily mostly started that war on his own business (the rest of the blame fell to Khomeini of iran)."
2,Insightful but one sided,The author provides some truly amazing information on who controls much of the world. Unfortunately she argues that all the bad guys are right wingers as she never accuses the left in any of her expose. Therefore her credibility is questionable in my opinion.
4,"We all know it's happening, and this book tells it.","Being Catholic, I've always felt the anti-catholic slant in my local newspaper. This book opens your eyes beyond what you see at your local level. This is the last acceptable prejudice, and the author does a pretty thorough job of explaining the history behind the mania. I recommend this read to other Catholics just for the awakening of media all around you. Remember, ""I am sending you as sheep among wolves."" But that doesn't mean we can't be alerted to the wolves predatory actions, which allow for our safe passage around them."
2,"Dance mixes suffer from ""radio edit"" syndrome!!!","I was so excited to stumble upon a mix I had missed by peak hour house remixer Norty Cotto. But when I received my CD I was devastated to find that the mix only runs 3:55! Another dance mix, softer house, by Waves of London, is 4:45. All other mixed are under 4 minutes, and are a mix of hip hop and reggae. Just wish they had put long dance mixes on this one."
5,more than I expected,"Being a music lover of all types and already having collections of songs from this era (the era is a small window of time between the advent of electronic recording and the commercial influence from the spread of radio and TV), I expected this to be just another collection of songs from this time period. It is much more than that! It stands alone as a work of art. There is one booklet that come with it that will explain the history of the anthology, its influence on the music of the sixties, and how much effort went in to cataloging details of the music. Another booklet was by Harry Smith and part of the original release. Every collection should have such a helpful and interesting book as he included! These are part of the experience as well. The songs are honest and excellent! It is hard to put a finger on it, so just put an ear to it. Harry Smith was an expert musicologist, a master in the field, with a huge and mysterious talent."
3,Beautiful Illustrations but for which age?,"This is a wonderful book for its concept and illustrations. If it's meant to help teach the alphabet to young children (which I believe it was judging from the picture of the toddler on the last page), then some of the bird choices for letters are too complex. Examples: A is for Atlantic Puffin, N is for Northern Cardinal, W is for White-Faced Scops Owl. This is an ambitious attempt to be precise, but it is does not match the cognitive and linguistic stage of a very young child. Still, it's a nice book, especially if you want to inspire a child's curiosity about birds."
1,"Wow, what a drive-me-nuts read!","Hong Kong is in the Formosa Strait? (page 208) A Taiwanese official could get security access code and connect to join a highly classified Pentagon-U.S.Pacific Command-U.S. Air Force base at Guam top secret video conference to say hello and blab,blab from Page 193 to Page 199? When Sun-Tzu wrote his ""The Art of War"", he never wrote anything about Yangtze & Yellow Rivers.(P.208) And based upon the whole stupid story and/or scenario(if there is any), there is nothing actually to do with ""The Art of War"" but a day-dreaming writer made up a total 448 pages' mumble-jumble without even checking the maps! My God, what a shameless and irresponsible writer!"
5,Great for traveling,"I bought this CD because I was very tired of the same old kids music as we traveled. This is a nice collection of songs. Some of them are upbeat, some of them are nice even tempo and some of them are slow. There is a nice combination of songs. My children (ages 2 and 4) have really enjoyed the music. I will admit it's not their favorite CD, but they enjoy it and will sing along with some of the songs. Woody is truly a classic in music and well worth introducing children to and well worth revisiting as an adult.Enjoy."
2,Windows Laptop does not hibernate with this connected,"Yes, it is quick to pick up signal but has one major problem and I guess it is with drivers that it comes with. I am using windows XP and it does not come out of hibernation if you hibernated the windows with this gps receiver connected. I contacted Holux support also and after number of emails back and forth, they said that i have to ship the unit to them. But I guess that this is a universal problem with this unit. So if you want to hibernated and want to successfully resume from hibernation, then disconnect this unit from the laptop first and then hibernated it. If somebody comes across any solution, please post here."
5,The Right Words at the Right Time,"Excellent book! It's a good feeling book, and knowing that the proceeds support St. Jude's Hospital makes it even better."
1,Target audience: the overprivileged,"If you're over 50, white and wealthy, this book is for you. If you are someone who has dealt with many of life's hardships, please do not look to this book for inspiration. It is such fluff, I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in it. Nothing profound lies within, it is poorly re-written and, seems to me, a quick way for Thomas to make some money and keep her name out there.Written by a wealthy older white person, for other wealthy older white people.P.S. I am white."
5,Excellent story,"When i bought this book i wasn't too sure about it, but when i started to read it, i was very entertained and impressed. This reminded me a lot of my middle school years, which i thought was very uplifting. Keep up the good work."
3,Hmmmm,"Okay, so, I just got these dolls for Christmas and I think they're really cute. Skimpy, but cute. Mind you, be very careful when dislocating the dolls hair from what it's attatched to...if you aren't careful, the hair gets frizzy and messed up...well, that's all!"
3,Disappointed in this book...,"I had attended a dream Dinners near my home and liked the concept. Since I prefer to use organic meats and produce, I thought that this may be a good opportunity to use some of the recipes with my own ingredients. I was very disappointed. There was only a small section on dinners, there were sections on breakfast, salads and deserts instead. My kids won't touch most of the meals."
1,Not What I Expected,"I purchased this cookbook hoping it would have some of their wonderful recipes offered at any Dream Dinner location. I was sadly mistaken. These recipes seem to be old family favorites, and not the delicious meals created by the expert Chef's at Dream Dinners. I did however, find 5-10 recipes that I will try. You've probably seen most of the recipes in here, only they put their own little twist on it. Overall, its not a horrible cookbook, just not what I expected."
3,Not as good as the franchise,"I love the Dream Dinners franchise--the food is out of this world. I was hoping the book would be as wonderful, perhaps with recipes for some of their signature dishes. I have come to the conclusion, however, that these are the recipes that will NEVER be served at Dream Dinners...they are not anywhere near the quality and taste of the franchise options. Very disappointing."
1,A complete rip-off,"I was a frequent Dream Dinners customer before we moved to a new area without a Dream Dinners franchise. The book info states it contains ""Dream Dinners favorites"", and everyone in the family eagerly looked forward to its arrival. What a disappointment. None of the more popular Dream Dinners recipes were in the book. Only one recipe that we have made at Dream Dinners over the years was in the book. The recipes contained within are stereotypical of any junior league cookbook most of us have lying around the house. The directions are vague. I would return it but it is not worth the return shipping cost to do so, so I will probably donate it to one of my college bounds kids. As a (former) Dream Dinners customer, this book is a huge disappointment, did not live up to what was promised and I feel completely ripped off."
1,"Poor recipes, little time saved","I was really excited about trying the Dream Dinners concept. As the mother of a very busy one-year-old, I hoped to save time. But as other reviewers have mentioned, the number of errors in the recipes meant that I had to make replacement meals after the Dream Dinners recipes failed. It was a waste of ingredients and of time. In addition, many of the recipes were not up to our standards, with very high salt content and bland flavor. I am very disappointed. I still love the concept, but this book is not the one to get if you want to save time and plan ahead."
3,Dream Dinners,"This cookbook is written well and the recipes are easily followed. The taste of the dinners for the most part leave something to be desired. There are a few that we enjoyed but on the whole we were not impressed. You have to like casseroles for one thing. But for the busy person, this may be the key. Just wish the recipes tasted better!!"
4,Not perfect but...,"I would give this CD 5 stars, but it's not EXACTLY perfect; no album would be unless it came WITH the guys live. :) Anyway, the first version of ""For the Girl Who Has Everything"" is the same as on the US self-titled debut album. The second has Justin singing the second verse instead of JC. The third has both mixed in and a little different (VERY slightly faster) beat. The Lion Sleeps Tonight is the great oldie, and thanks to these guys, goodie. Chris sings the main part and in the last verse Justin echos him. Lance is in the background giving a beat and all the guys are harmonizing with ""wee-muh-wuh-wep""'s. *NSYNC sounds amazing as usual--Great CD!"
5,This CD is sooo neat!!!,"Hello! I recently purchased this cd and it's awesome!! Aside from the unreleased track, The Lion Sleeps Tonight (soo sweet) it's enhanced. You can see all the European videos and clips of them talking or just acting silly. It's so awesome. This is a must have for any 'N Sync fan. And, hey, even if you're not a huge fan you might change your mind after this. :)"
1,Goes to show a five-minute comedy sketch can't be lengthened,"Billy Madison (1995) Adam Sandler, Darren McGavin, Bridgette Wilson, Bradley Whitford, Josh Mostel, Norm McDonald, Mark Beltzman, Larry Hankin, Theresa Merritt, D: Tamra Davis. A spoiled and lurid slacker-who spends most of his time getting wasted-must repeat grades K-12 in order to become heir to his family's hotel business before his scheming opponent does. Weak, moronic calamity shows off Sandler's infantile behavior while keeping the drunk/stoned and flatulence jokes alive, which mostly lose fuel over a single, on-running situation that is elementary school funny. Sandler's comic buddies from the SNL skits, Steve Buscemi and Chris Farley are unbilled. Running Time: 89 minutes and rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, language and brief violence."
3,Probably Sandler's best,"There is a disarming sweetness to this film that makes the usual juvenile humor and one-joke plot bearable.Adam Sandler seems to be best at playing this sort of character,a goof-ball with sopophoric sensibilities,but ultimately is very good-natured.I'm not the biggest Adam Sandler fan in the world,but I rather enjoyed this.There are some genuinely funny moments,and surprisingly,it does a good job of capturing the grade-school experience from a kid's point of view,which,when you think about it,Sandler pretty much has a corner on."
4,One of my favorites!! :D,"This movie is stupid, silly and weird but in the best possible way!!! A great movie to watch with friends. I think anyone 13 and over would enjoy this leave your logic at the door film :) It may be older, but its still worth a watch."
5,O'Doyle Rules!!,"This is the 2nd best movie that I have ever seen in my entire life(Happy Gilmore is the first).But this movie is not far from number one.Here is what the movie is about:Billy Madison is someone who must go back to school or else a total mean person named Eric gets the company.One of the funniest characters in the movie are the O'Doyle family.They beat everyone up and say ""O'Doyle Rules"".If you are looking for a seriously funny movie,then get this movie.Trust me,you will have absolutely no regrets.Peace Out."
5,2 THUMBS WAY WAY UP!-Ally and Jenn,An awesome movie!-Jenn The funniest thing I've ever seen!-Ally THE BEST!-Ally and Jenn
4,SANDLER AND HIS FRIENDS ARE FUNNY IN THIS GOOFY COMEDY!,"What can I say?.....I like this film. It is juvenile, but Sandler and friends are very funny in this goofy movie. Sandler plays a rich 30 something kid who will lose control of the family business and his inheritance if he doesn't go back to school and complete kindergarten through 12th grade in a short amount of time. The plot is pretty thin, but it rolls along with many familiar faces from SNL trading punches through out. The DVD transfer looks good."
1,disappointed,"An otherwise funny plot is ruined by f-bombs and other inappropriate language. Recommend to those who find inappropriate language hilarious. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money."
5,Excellent product,"These cookies are excellent in flavor and texture. They are the best wheat free, gluten free and non-dairy cookies I have tried. My son is on a very restrictive diet and is a picky eater. He just yums up these cookies. I often have to battle him to eat something else because he wants his cookies. These are the only cookies of this type he will eat. I don't know much about the other flavors but this flavor of cookie is tops.The only complaint I have is that Amazon will not package them correctly. They will not cushion the bottom of the box and so a lot of cookies are broken upon arrival. I have E-Mailed a complaint but have not heard anything. Hopefully my next shipment will be packaged correctly."
4,A KID Shield,"This is a great kid shield. and it is for a kid, it is only about 13 in wide, as said in the discription."
5,Awesome shield!,The shield was better than I'd expected. I thought maybe it was one of those really flimsy types of plastics but it was a lot sturdier. My son was Cap for halloween and even now he's still banging into everything that gets in his way...including me. Awesome!
5,Very well done,"This is the story behind the 2002 University of Maryland basketball championship season and also serves as mini-biographies of Gary Williams, Juan Dixon, and the University of Maryland basketball program. Very well written and organized, it will be interesting for sports fans, even those not U. of Maryland fans. The many tragedies suffered by the institution and individuals associated with the program are heart rending and compelling.The Maryland championship season is a real life triumph over tragedy story. Regardless of where one's rooting interests lie, I dare say nobody can read Juan Dixon's story and not marvel at his perseverance and leadership. A true, shining example of heart and courage."
2,dry reading,As a college student I find this book to be very dry reading. The explanations and definitions are accurate which is its only saving grace. Very frustrating to read and memorize when you find yourself wasting time simply trying to understand the sentence.
2,Ouch.,"I just bought these the other day and they are going straight back to the store. The sound quality is good. Noise canceling works somewhat and I can hear better when I turn it on. However, turning on noise canceling seems mostly to just increase the volume. As a test, I turned my TV on in the background at a very low volume. So low that I couldn't distinguish any words but could still hear voices. I could hear those voices even with noise canceling turned on.I could put up with that, though, since they more than serve my purpose and not too expensive. The reason I am returning these is because they HURT! I am a woman with an average sized head. After only ten to fifteen minutes my ears begin to ache from being squeezed so tightly. I am constantly nudging the headphones to different positions in an attempt to ease the discomfort. But it's just too persistent. I can only imagine how they must feel for a man or somebody with a larger head."
4,essential,"There Goes my Gun is BRILLIANT on this one, even better than it is on Doolittle, Manta Ray is cute and sometimes you can't get it out of your head. It has got a live feel without compromising quality of sound. Wild...Pie and (in Heaven) are messy but who cares? The whole album is filled with passion, Levitate Me goes wild here. You HAVE to have this is you a true Pixies fan, but if you are there would be no question about it anyway."
3,Good but unnecessary,"Pop Kulcher Review: Capitalizing on the semi-resurgence of popularity for this underappreciated late-80's Boston band (following the release of last year's greatest hits package), Elektra has compiled a collection of BBC sessions by the band from 1988 through 1991. Contrary to the cd's packaging, this isn't exactly ""live"" so much as live-in-studio -- think of it as alternate versions of random tunes throughout the band's career. A few are among the band's best songs (""Wave of Mutilation,"" ""Is She Weird""), and there are a couple previously-unreleased songs (a noisy cover of the Beatles' goof ""Wild Honey Pie"" among them), but most of this is definitely for fans only; great sound, fine tunes, but not an essential part of the Pixies' catalog."
5,Give joey one note and he's made five,"this is in effect a greatest hits, although some may argue why isnt ""insert song title"" not on here. But basically that is all it is. It doesnt really offer the chance to here them live as they are in the BBC studios, and they are also not recorded within one set (over three or four years)BUT dont get me wrong, what they have done on here is good. There are variations on older songs, such as dead and wave of mutilation, which in my opinion sound slightly better and more up beat.The recording does also allow for you to here ALL the parts equally. As with the 'special' mixing on Sufer rosa, you cant quite always here the guitars or bass (the drum levels were deliberately turned up - very special, eh?)This is good, just basically to here old Joe on his Les Paul playing around with one note making an entire fistful is worth the price of a cd."
5,Ahhh.... relaxation,"I have these used these on and off since i was a kid. These are great for getting rid of the nervous feelings so you can sleep before your big meeting or exam, or if you just need a little extra something to put you to sleep."
4,so sleepy...,I had trouble winding down and sleeping at night so my Naturopathic doctor suggested this sleep aid. It definitely pushes me to the edge of sleeping. My eyes get very heavy after 30-45 min. I've never taken more than 2.
1,THIS IS A DVD-R DISK - NOT DISCLOSED IN DESCRIPTION,"This is a DVD-R disk, not a mass produced commercial disk. Nothing wrong with that but it needs to be disclosed in the item description. Defective disk would not play in any of my devices. Disappointed."
1,be careful,BAD C.D NEVER COULD GET IT TO PLAY WE HAVE 3 MP3 PLAYERS AND ALL3 SAID BAD DISK TRYED TO CLEAN IT BUT STILL NEVER WORKEDI GUESS THATS WHY IT WAS CHEAP!!
4,Great Escape,"A romantic trip through the covered wagon days when life was hard and sex was inspired by love - not porn. Missed it so much when I finished, had to order the next in the series. Amazon was kind enough to get the next-""Another Dawn"" here within days so I didn't have to wait."
1,Boringly Wicked,"The plot was uninteresting. The characters were dull. A Very Boring dialogue.... Nothing to capture ones interest in the story. I could not continue reading.......I wanted to give the book a chance so I tried and kept reading along, but it did not work............"
4,"Reply to Nowfan35?s ""NOW Needs Improvement...Now...""","The reason Amarillo is featured on here, is because the CD is an import from the UK, where the song was re-released and got to No. 1."
3,Now 60!! Okay ??,Its Okay album but the only songs i like on this cd are:Gwen Stefani: What You Waiting For?Nelly: Over and OverLl Cool J: HushAshanti: Only UCiara feat. Petey Pablo: GoodiesAkon: Locked UpU2: VertigoThe Killers: Somebody Told MeJoJo: Baby Its UI Like The American Series better.This CD has to much Pop andDance songs.
3,Nice cases but not a very nice price--ANYWHERE,If you need the space and like your DVDs in one case(each case stores 2) and a durable plastic clear outer case for cover art then this is the best deal I could find.I'll be honest the price is not worth it unless you really need the standard size cases..The 5 DVD cases are MUCH cheaper and just as durable.I needed the space so I paid the price
1,WTF,"I got this while it was on sale and thought ""hey what a great deal from cyber monday"" but I ended up with only the special features disc, no movie. WTF?"
5,One of My Personal Favourites,"This film really shows the appeal of the X-MEN property, I have watched it many times. It actually had heart, unlike others like 'The Phantom Menace', and didn't feel fake or overdone. Unknown actor Hugh Jackman shows tremendous talent as Wolverine...his appeal is in his lack of a backstory, there can't really be a star to the X-team, but Xavier is the anchor. The cast is great, McKellen and Stewart are a nice match and dialogue can be thoughtful. The DVD is great, containing everything you might want connected to the film..."
2,Looks like a pilot for a series.,"This is interesting, as I never read the X-Men. So I did not have any preconception or know if any of the charters are important or known.The story is clear. You can tell the bad guys from the good. They do not try to mask anything and did an excellent job of telling the back-story. They picked the right actors for the parts and the actors did not over shadow the characters they played. You have to stretch your imagination a bit but it is worth it. The only drawback was the morals of you get what you ask for in spades.Bottom line is it is worth watching once to say you saw it."
1,Just bad,This movie was a diapointment. How could Stan Lee just let some director butcher his characters like that. Wolverine wasn't nice he had attitude where he didn't give a damn and was more of an aggresive fighter. But in this movie it was just done wrong. Magneto is too old. Rogue dosn't do any thing. It is clear that the director has never read a X-Men comic in his life. This whole movie is just about wolverine and rogue. The sequal was some what better but not great.
3,Not Bad.,"This is a great little show. It is about these mutants (in the movie they ruined it by saying it was evolution, but the comic said it was nucular waste) and they want to have rights but everyone says theyre just horrible freakds. So some mutants tryed to kill AL the normal people. BUt they X-Men try to save them. Which is a mistake because in X-Men 2 the villans in 1 turn good and the people try to kill the mutants."
