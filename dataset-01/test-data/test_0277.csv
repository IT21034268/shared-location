4,Good Deal For The Price,"I ordered this item toget my dvd's off the floor. I have a hometheater room as nice as a screening room at the public theater.I needed something to use as soon as possible and even in my veryexpensive home theater room with a 113 inch screen and highest dollar projector I was glad to get my dvd's off the floor andI now have 150 dvd's in these little units and will be purchasing3 more. They have style and serve the purpose for me. It willtake awhile to have all my in-wall units built and my dvd's lookmuch better in them. I found they fit in each slot very well andyou may have to be careful with them but I really think they look quite nice and for the price I think they are the best I could find and held the most. Some discs do close differently andthat may cause those to look less even, But, They are off the floor and I really do like the design. I wish I could have found some that held 100 in this stylish design."
2,"Great music, awful singing","Don't get me wrong - I love afrobeat, but I got to it from the other end - Albino! and Antibalas, so I got used to great arrangements, perfect production and excellent musicianship. Then, I decided to check out the source of it all, Fela Kuti, and alas, I was greatly disappointed. There is no doubt about his talent and musical vision, but the quality of musicianship is inferior to the newer bands. Whoever plays keyboards in the band sounds like he just bought his first keyboard the day before. As a vocalist, Kuti is not much better - his english is awful and he does not know when to stop - he can take a phrase or a word and repeat it until you see stars and stripes. The band sounds pretty good as an ensemble though, but still, I prefer the new bands."
5,a classic,"i loved it - if you want a very funny take on the end of the clinton presidency, this is it."
3,"Sweeps great, but difficult to use","The duster part is great, but the handle is not so great. It really collects the dust, so no complaints about how well it cleans our hardwood floors. The sweeper head is a pretty good size -- small enough to fit around furniture, but large enough for open areas; however it is too bulky to use on our stairs. It's a little heavy, but not enough to be a nuisance or cause any problems. The handle is high-quality aluminum, both light and sturdy. It is adjustable for length, but even fully extended it is a little bit too short for ultimate comfort, but definitely still easily usable -- I'm 6'1"". My real complaint is that when I maneuver the duster around furniture, the handle either unscrews itself from the head or the twist-lock unlocks and the handle collapses. Sometimes both happen at once. These problems are not just a once-in-a-while occurrence, I have problems pretty much every time I sweep. And that keeps me from really loving this duster."
1,"Cheap, but.........","Everything crushed after 3 days of using, if You buy it don't use turbo settings from the bios. I bought the same mainboard again (only newer version) nd it works ok."
1,Less than one star,"This book is embarrasingly bad. It reads like a highschool fanzine/blog. Perhaps that is the intention? Do we really need to be TOLD who Audubon was or have yoga positions and zen concepts explained to us like a child? Condescending and stupid. Too bad he didn't describe more incidents when Jim hurt people. That would have at least been interesting. I think the DRUMMER and the KEYBOARDIST have written enough, but Ka-ching goes the cash register, breakin on through to the consumer side..."
5,Thoughts That Take You Heavenward,"This is truly a masterpiece that combines God's Holy Word, with music that lifts the soul to Heaven, and prayers that take you into the very presence of God. Sara Singleton has done a wonderful job of integrating all of these elements in a way that truely challenges your heart, stirs your soul, and prompts a response that causes you(the pilgrim) to praise and glorify our great God and King. These daily devotions are sure to bless you as you travel along on your earthly pilgrimage."
3,A must read for those Richtofen last flight buffs.,"The authors confirm the earlier judgement of P.J. Carisella's work ""Who Shot the Red Baron."" This most recent work contains numerous first hand accounts, particularly from the Allied side, of Richtofen's last flight. Particularly interesting are the actual reports submitted by those involved.The authors combine their own practical flight experience, along with photographs (both period and today) of the famous ""last flight"" route, to convincingly determine and at point in the ""last flight"" Richtofen received his mortal wound, and who inflicted it. Addionally, they contend Richtofen made a ""map reading"" error that greatly contributed to the final outcome.World War I aviation buffs will want to add this work to their collections."
1,The Dumbest $#!@ I ever Said....(My name is O.I.),"This album is no doubt the worst album I have ever heard ever since that Eazy-E Album. I brought this album thinking C-Murder ot out of his old ways. But sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeyet, I was wrong."
2,Could have been a lot better...........,"There are only a few tight tracks on this cd. C-murder should have took more time on this project since he ain't going anywhere anytime soon. The only tracks worth listening to are My Life, Yall Heard of Me (Single), Camouflage and Murder (only because Mac and Currency), and Mama How U Figure (which is the tightest cut on the album in my opinion."
5,PalmOne Tungsten Handheld,"PalmOne Tungsten Handheld.Excellent as always from Amazon. Great vendor, right on-time delivery. Product exactly as advertised and then some.Thank you for being there.Keep up the great service and selection of reliable, trustworthy sources.Jerry"
2,Probs w/ the Mac (OS X.3-Jaguar),"I loved the look and feel, as well as text entry capabilities of the T3, that is, until I went and tried to load the software onto my Macintosh Powerbook. It turns out (after spending 6 hours in vein on the phone w/ Apple and Palm) that OS X.3 Jaguar is NOT supported and Palm refuses to release a timeline as to when it will be available. Wait a while because right now I have a cool device that can't hotsync... Poor customer service on Palm's end, in my opinion. This fact was not listed in the Macintosh-related FAQ on the Palm site and was no where to be seen on the requirements page (ie., that it was flat out incompatible w/ Panther, and that new software is currently under development)"
2,Palm Tungsten T3,"I was expecting a T3 in ""like new"" and ""mint"" conditions, as advertised by seller. Instead I got a unit that would not hold charge and had too much friction in the sliding mechanism. At least the seller had the decency of accepting back the unit right away and refunding all charges, including return shipment."
4,Learn a Language,I wanted to learn Armenian and thought this would be a good start. It tends to jump ahead too quickly to grammatical aspects of the language. A tad too advanced for my needs.
5,a exceptional cookbook,"This book is more than just a cookbook,it has great advice for buying cookware,mixers,knives etc.Also gives you a guide to what you really need in your kitchen. The recipes are great too!"
1,Save your money and give to a charity,"I purchased a copy of this book through one of Amazons sellers. Thank goodness I didn't pay full price. The book cover in no way resembles the book cover on Amazon's listing. After looking through the book intently, I put in the pile of books that will go to the thrift store. Recipes are one's that I would never use. His methods are so outdated that it's laughable. For example, he doesn't want you to use a food processor for mashed potatoes. He says they're too mushy. I make mashed potatoes and they're fine. I just FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. I found none of the recipes useful and all of them time consuming.Wish I had saved my money. If you must spend your money give it to a charity and it'll be better used.I have a great many cookbooks and some are more useful than others. This is the first one though, that I've put on the thrift shop pile on the first day I received it."
2,Uninspired.,"Note that this was the last album by the old lineup (only founder Ed Wynne and flautist John stayed on), and by this time what was once fresh and powerful became trite, formulaic, and needlessly overproduced. In particular I don't think there was a single memorable riff by Ed the lead guitarist on the entire album, something I cannot say about any of their other CDs. Overall the album is lacking something which you can usually find on most of their other albums-energy? Inventiveness? In any event go elsewhere if you are an Ozrix newbie."
4,I would recommend it to anyone.,The software is very insiteful. The reason I gave it four stars is because it is not the easiest to use.
2,Beware of Edits,"While I'm glad that Season 2 of Dragnet is finally released, I was disappointed to find the Pilot movie to be edited. It's missing the 2 minute Prologue that leads into the Opening Credits.The Uncut movie begins with Jack Webb doing his ""This is the City..."" and shows scenic L.A. including the Crime Scenes that Joe and Bill are going to encounter. Also, rather unique for Dragnet, is the showing of one of the victims right before she gets killed. All of this leads into the Universal logo and the famous Dragnet theme. In this DVD version, the movie begins with the Universal logo and Dragnet theme and skips right over the first 2 minutes of the movie.When AMC was showing the movie a couple of years ago, they showed the complete movie. TBS also ran the complete movie back in the 1990s.I understand the movie is included as a bonus, but edited movies on DVD are no bonus.I haven't watched all the episodes yet, so I dont know if any of those episodeshave been edited as well."
1,Bike lock/cable,"""If you're not on your bike, make sure we are. Thieves will take the path of least resistance. Pack of three, keyed alike six foot cables are ideal for bicycles, skateboards and sports equipment.""Nice feature for the thieves:I found this item (exactly the same) in Wal-Mart. They had 5 sets on the shelf.The set of keys did fit 4 of 5 other sets of locks too.So much of protection... :("
3,"cool, but sucky durability",This is really cool and has tons of secret compartments and is fun to build but it has terrible durability. After i built it I was showing my mom the stuff it does and the most of it broke off and hit the ground and went into peices so i rebuilt it and the same thing happened again. So if you get it be really careful holding it and picking it up. Its especially fun to play with if you have the jedi starfighter cuz you can make them battle or have jango fett and obi-Wan fight. It has 2 heat seeking missiles and jango fetts guns. It also has a place where you can put bombs in and make them come out of the bottom but i wouldnt try it cuz itll probably break.
5,"Nice Set, Niiiiiiice","i was lucky enough to pick up this model for half price at an unnamed retailer and I am very pleased with it. There are some nice features such as the cargo storage units and bomb bay. Of course the set includes the awesome Jango Fett and clone ""son"" Boba. My only complaint is that the design of the wing covers are rather flimsy (not the wings themselves, but the rounded parts that hide the wing's connection point). they keep falling off or loosen when handled. A little pricey, but well worth it!"
4,Nice Old Fashioned Christmas Romance Story!,To Wed At Christmas was good it was a cute little old fashioned romance story set in a small town and about the relationhip of a guy named David Shepherd and a lady named Harmony Martin.
4,Ambrose delivers a rousing yarn,"Ambrose's books are always interesting and different from each other and most other books. This is no exception. It's an intriguing idea, and well thought out, although it can make your head swim trying to make sense of it sometimes. A satisfying read, with a logical (so to speak) ending."
1,Good Film - Lousy DVD Transfer,"One of the last 'buckle-your-swash' actors, Cornel Wilde gives a rousing performance in this good film. Unfortunately the Platinum DVD is not worth your money. No re-mastering, looks like a bad print that was transferred to VCR and then copied to DVD. Grainy, with streaks throughout, fuzzy, fluctuating colors bad sound. Wilde deserved better than this. So do the fans."
1,Not What It Should Be,"Perhaps this item is more for storage on the shelf, it is definitly not for the tech on the go. First, when open, it does not lay flat, but at an awkward angle, thus the weight of the open pages and CDs rests on the end of the zipper. The zipper did not last long. Second, the slots for the CDs are a bit too tight. If you use just one side of each page, it is marginally acceptable, but using both sides makes it too tight and binding on the CD. Even using just one side, the top 1/8"" of each CD on the bottom row overlaps the plastic slot from the row above instead of resting all nice & safe on the material.I think it is a great buy and unit for storing CDs in at the office if you do not have to use it daily, but on the road or frequent use will destroy this item."
4,Excellent !,"320 CD/DVD, durable, double sided storage... a really nice choice when you have hundreds of dvd or cds."
1,High Priest of California,"The late Charles Willeford isn't for everybody and if he were judged by this book he'd just be another hack writing bad books at an alarming rate. You gotta love the day when writers were paid by the word. This one features a car salesman with no ethics and only one goal in life- to seduce an innocent lady just trying to get along. He, like the book, has no redeeming merit. If you're new to Willeford, try Miami Blues. That's the acid test. But be warned, Willeford didn't hang around in nice neighborhoods with virtuous people."
5,awesome,my boys loved it .. i bought a few more sets for the kids for christmasthe boys play for hours with this toy.. and that makes me very happy.. thanks
1,horrible product...,"made my fight night 3 times worse then it already was, paid 17 dollars for this true crap at wallmart. CD wouldnt work and it dint have major scrathes, just bunch of light ones. all it did is shined em up so i can see them better. dont buy this. i could've gotten a new game for less !!!"
2,I really wanted to like it...,"I had such high hopes for this book. I think I gave it a fair chance (I stopped on page 122). At 700 pages with a smallish type set, there is enough material here for a few books. Cantor's style of tangent-laden sentences, skipping through multiple time periods without much segue make for slow-going work. MANY different characters with similar sounding names and all with secondary names as well add to the confusion. Might pick this back up in the future if feeling more adventurous."
4,Very Good!,This was the first romance book I read and I was hooked at the start. The storyline has so many twists and turns that you never know what will happen next. I was surprised that this type of book was so entertaining but I couldn't put it down!
3,worth the money with some suggestion for improvement,"pretty good device and loving it so far. come on, merely over a $20, and this is money well spent.Cons: the signal strength could be a little better with more frequency channels. Theree ain't enouhg. And as far as mine is concerned, not even all three are working but only one.The seller is known to ship out the item not necessarily to the request of the buyer's color choice. And that was the case with mine. I ordered White but instead a Black one arrived. I could've called the company and asked to be exchanged but what the heck... i ain't that picky.the plastic material that the item was made out of could be a better quality one. but then again, its only a $20 something bucks, right?Pros: fits well into the socket and holds tight. does what it's supposed to do at an acceptable rate. I would recommend to those with tight budget."
3,"Buy this, only if discounted.","When I bought this, the price was at around $20.00 with free shipping!! I figured, even if it tasted horrendous, I'm getting such a great deal anyway. Well, the taste is not horrible, but it wasn't that great either. Now, I realize that this is protein and not a gourmet shake, but I have tasted many whey protein products that were quite tasty! This stuff is just okay.I'd say, If you can find this protein at a very discounted price, go for it. Otherwise, I'd try something else."
4,Good toy for 4-6 year old,"My son received this for Christmas last year. He was almost 4 years old, and he has enjoyed playing with it. We had no problem getting ours to work. The sound and picture quality is great. This Viewmaster is different from the classic kind in that you have to insert the plastic case (it has a little cartridge attached to it) into the back of the toy to get the sound to go along with the picture reels. Each of the reels has three discs with 21 pictures total. Right now (August '07), the supply for this and the reels is low, so Amazon's price is not the best. I've recently seen them in Target and Wal-Mart for a lot less."
5,Awesome Toy!!!,"Its cool except for a couple faults. The faults are: It's ALWAYS falling apart, there are only 4 troopers. Except for those its great"
3,Kinda does it,"Lyrics are not as socially relevant, the funk isn't as biting, but at its best the seduction is nearly as smooth, as Curtis continued sailing back to earth with this soundtrack after a trailblazing solo career introduction. There aren't enough great songs to justify a wholehearted recommendation, plus a few watered down crowd-pleasers and a direct rip (New Orleans= Grapevine), but LDIA still deserves attention and would belong in any Mayfield aficionados's collection"
2,Large wrists,"Lovely watch but it is on the large scale. If you have small wrists like the majority of the females i know then it won't fit you, despite being for women"
4,This vacuum sucks!,"I love how it sucks! The red light goes off to tell you if you need to keep cleaning. I have had the vacuum now for over a year and love it.Few downsides... The front light has already gone off and it come with a short hose. The powered nozzle attachment is a gimick, yet the main vacuum works wonderfully.I like having the options to switch from bag to bagless.Update 11-15-2007 We had to return the vacuum back to Costco because it stopped working."
4,"Cute, just as pictured","As pictured, very cute. The belt looks a little rough but goes with the look. Love the boot covers and tunic."
3,Publicity Stunt,"The book would have seemed so much more clever had Blair Witch not successfully made us ponder the truth or fiction question first. Instead it just seems like a weak publicity ploy for King to squeeze a few more dollars out of his fans. The book itself was a smooth easy read, if rather vague. It really wasn't worth the money, however, for such a short book. I think, too, it could have been more believable if it hadn't been so extreme. I was more likely to roll my eyes than to shiver with fear.As for the question of whether it is a hoax, if there is still anyone unsure: Beaumont University's website is not a '.org', which all institutions are, and it is copywrited by Hyperion, the publisher of the book."
4,Captivating Read,"I'm sorry I didn't discover this book before I saw the movie, Rose Red. It might have made the movie more interesting. As it was, Rose Red the movie seemed scattered and silly to me, with extremely unlikable characters. This book would probably have made for better TV viewing. It gives a very clear (if at times racy) picture of the life of a woman in the early 1900's. Ellen Rimbauer's personality comes through on each page. She is a very interesting character. This is a fast and captivating read."
5,"The is no reason to be ""DUPED""","one person here wrote that he thought this book was terrible because it is not an actual diary but a work of fiction. The book is sold in the fiction section of bookstores and it has a sticker on the front of the book tying it into a King miniseries. To my knowledge, ing has never done a ""True Story"". This is a work of fiction and as such was a well written tie in book. People need ot understand that."
2,Rose REd,I have admittedly not read the book BUT the TV movie was a steal on The Haunting of Hill house!
4,No Way a True Diary,"This was an excellent read. It was extremely well written and very detailed which leads me to conclude that there is no way this is a true diary. Nobody who keeps a diary writes this much or this explicitly. The sexual overtones were immense. I believe, having found the Steven King clues as well, that this book has to be Mr. King's fulfillment of a desire to write a romance novel and the only way he knew how to do it was to wrap a haunted house around it."
4,Probably the best written book on the paranormal I have read,"This is a fascinating book which flows easily through Ellen's life. I could feel her anticipation prior to John's marriage proposal. I was happy for her as her children were born, and felt her sorrow at her losses. The accounts of her growing love for Sukeena were heartbreaking as John added his perversion to their friendship. An easy read, I bought the paper back and finished it almost at once. I have tried accessing the omitted sections from Reardon's web site to no avail. I will also try to find friend Tina's diary pages. This one is a worthy read!"
4,"Good tie-in, interesting read","First, let me say that the book will make sense whether or not you saw the Rose Red mini-series on ABC. If you did see it, the diary offers much more background information, and if you didn't see it, you probably will want the DVD after you're finished reading.For Stephen King fans, the book has similarities with several others (peepholes through animal heads, sex perverts, lots of realistic portrayals of bodily functions - name me another author that describes vomit or going to the bathroom so eloquently?!?)Don't let that scare you off - it is a quick read, and a finely woven story. Just when you think it can't get any stranger - King throws in another twist or turn."
1,Horrible. What a disappointment,"After getting over the anger and disappointment that this was not an actual diary, but a work of fiction (dispite the fact it was being sold in the non-fiction section of the store) I decided to give it a try, figuring that if Stephen King is involved somehow (and even possibly the original writer) it must be good. What a HUGE mistake. The book was terrible. The plot doesn't flow or grab your attention in any way. The characters (especially Ellen herself) are pathetic and underdeveloped. The actual ghost story of the book isn't even good. It was a complete waste of money and time."
4,My Life at Rose Red - book,I really did like this book...wish there was a little more towards the end. There was so much in the beginning and the latter part was few and far between. Just wish there was more. But I liked it and will most likely read it again.
5,A Wonderful Illusion,"Okay I admit I was suckered in!! The book was absolutely awesome, and I even went so far as to look at the website given in the book for further diary entries. Hmmmm...that's funny, the only section that opens on the ""university"" website (where Ms. Reardon is evidently one of 3 professors!!) is the information page for Rose Red. Before I figured that out I actually gave my e-mail address for Ms. Reardon and her colleagues to keep me posted on supernatural occurences in my area. (storm watch for ghosts?? sign me up!) Nonetheless, I was so impressed with the book that it doesn't matter if it's true or not. Although, now I have to cancel my plans for a trip to Washington in hopes of a tour I suppose. Back to the review, this story gets you so involved in the lives of the characters that you actually fear for them (some of them anyway) and you can't stop reading until you see what happens. LOVE IT!!!!"
4,A very Haunting tale.,"I could not help but see the similarity of this book to Edgar Allen Poe's ""The fall of the House of Usher"". A house that seems to be ""alive"" and how it controls the life of Ellen Rimbauer, to the point of madness. A very easy read and not boring or dragged out at all. This is a Haunting tale that really keeps you reading."
3,Don't expect too much,"First, remember that this is a movie tie-in book. They are usually written in a hurry and are basicly the script fleshed out. In other words, don't expect too much from this book. Second, Stephen King did not write this, thank goodness and neither did his wife, Tabitha. It has some lovely, spooky moments and is low key, atmospheric horror mixed with a large dose of woman-as-eternal-victimolgy. It's not the greatest or even extremely good but it's not bad either. It does what it set out to do, which is to promote the movie."
4,what Anastasia thought of it.,"I THOUGHT THAT THE BOOK WAS VERY GOOD. IT KEPT ME INTERESTED IN IT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE BOOK. (WHEN MOST CAN GET A LITTLE SLOW FROM TIME TO TIME.) I WILL HAVE TO SAY THAT THE MOVIE TO ME LEFT A LITTLE TO BE DESIRED, ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I HAD AN IDEA IN MY OWN MIND AS TO WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE AND IT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT. I DONT THINK THAT THE MOVIE WAS BAD, I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER THAN IT WAS. MOST MOVIES FAIL IN COMPARISON TO THE BOOK. THAT GOES FOR ANY AUTHOR. SO IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING READING THE BOOK, I WOULD DEFINITLY SAY GO FOR IT.ITS DEFINITLY WORTH YOUR TIME!"
3,A Good Opportunity Spoiled,"The author missed a tremendous opportunity to write a masterpiece. The access to players, inside information and details of the PGA Tour was very impressive. Unfortunately, the stories were disconnected and often incomplete. It seemed as if the author had a difficult time maintaining a theme or train of thought. While this is understandable for information collected over a long period of time, it made the book fragmented and difficult to read."
1,Mark Twain said it,"You would think from all of the hype over the years that Mark Feinstein uttered the phrase, "" a good walk spoiled"". Not true. Mark Twain said, ""Golf is a good walk spoiled"". Nice try Feinstein.David Pendergrass"
5,Great book,"I first read this book years ago, and have since read it again. This is one great book. If you are even remotely interested in golf and/or the goings-on of the PGA Tour, read this book."
5,You don't need to be a golfer to enjoy this one,Excellent work on a frustrating and fun game. The background info was particularly interesting.
5,Running the SaharaP How the impossible is possible,Truly amazing and inspiring story. I watched it 3 times and will teach you how the impossible can be made possible
1,Very Buggy Game!!,"I love playing risk with my friends when we hang out. We used to just play the board game but I recently bought this one hoping that it would be a faster alternative...and maybe more fun. But, after playing this at home by myself, I discovered there are far too many bugs in this game to make it playable. On my 3rd game, I beat the game by completing the mission, or so I thought anyway, but then it gave the win to one of the other computer players who I had just annihilated. Also, I don't like the controls...its far too easy to accidentally end your turn or fail to move your troops by hitting the circle key. The designers should have implemented a yes/no command option for this reason. Honestly, I found the old Macintosh Risk computer game made over 15 years ago to be a better version than this one. Looks like i'm going to have to return to the old board game version."
3,Risk Fans Only...But Forget About Online Play,"In a nutshell this game is a faithful translation of the popular board game. The developers have tried to make the game more interesting but adding a host of unlockable items to keep you interested in single player mode. But the most attractive feature of this version is also the biggest let down. The online play feature works well and even supports the use of a USB headset. However, since Risk is not as popular as say Madden 2004, the pressence of online players is lacking(to put it mildly). Having said that if you are even a passive fan of the board game(and don't mind playing agianst CPU opponents) for the affordable price this is a good buy."
2,This just fell apart.....,"A first I couldn't put this book down, then I couldn't pick it up. A good read till midway though it simply fell apart. Too implausible, the ending seemed like a good reason to throw in some unrelated overglorified instances that had no bearing on Astrid's life. It tried to tie up loose ends but got lost in it's own language. I got bored. I wanted to see a solid ending...this one was not only unthinkable for this girl Astrid that I came to like--but unimaginable, and silly. Oprah, what were you thinking? Just because a story is about an abused foster child doesn't make it a ""must read"". Give us something with tooth!"
4,Beautiful Tale,"This book was one of the better books I have read recently. It was sitting on my shelf for a lot longer than it should have. Something about the cover told me to hold off, but I should have known that looks can be deceiving. Ingrid and Astrid are mother and daughter. But not your typical American mother and daughter team. Ingrid is a poet with a bohemian lifestyle, and her daughter Astrid a very talented artist. The fundamental difference is that Ingrid's and Astrid's longing in life are opposite. Ingrid wants everything outside of the norm, and Astrid just wants a normal home life. Of course, Astrid gets anything but a normal childhood from her mother, or the subsequent foster mothers she encounters after Ingrid is jailed for murder.Narrated by Astrid, this tale is so fluid in description and feeling that you just float through the book. I was disappointed at the end, not only because I didn't want the story to end, but because I wanted to know more.Don't skip out on this great book."
4,Great Page Turner,"White Oleander was a huge suprise. I had ordered it months ago, and then it sat in my bookshelf. I was searching for my next book to read when I decided to finally pick this one up. I had forgotten what it was even about, but from the first page I was hooked. I just could not put the book down without knowing what happened to Astrid. It was such a moving and intersting novel. I read it in two days! Any avid reader will love it!"
2,The wordyness gets in the way of the point of the book,"I thought that the book was too descriptive, and flowery. I found that all of the excess words got in the way of the point of the book and what the author was really trying to say. I just couldn't get into it."
1,Saw it coming from a mile away,"The writing about CA is beautiful. BUT...Although I've gotten through a fair amount of this book so far, I've actually started skipping through the chapters to see if what I thought would happen would. Ray, Clair, knew it. Let's see, murder, underage sex, beautiful of course, shootings, mauled by dogs, suicide. What next, kidnapped by terrorists? White slavery?. Pretentious Ingrid to make us take it seriously. Huge plotpoints with minimal impact on the characters, little meaning. Would work better as soap opera or Jackie Collins; there wouldn't be the assumption that this is ""literature."" You have to wonder about publishing criteria. This story has been told a dozen times lately, Bastard out of Carolina, Liars Club, etc. even The Color Purple 20 years ago (MUCH BETTER)"
2,Very over-rated tale.,"I agree 100% with the reviewers who found this book silly, filled with transparent melodrama and feeble development in plot and characterization. I suggest you take the advice of the many reviewers of this book and read something worthwhile like THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, or if Oprah books are your only fictional desires, MOTHER OF PEARL, or I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE."
3,Reader beware...another depressing Oprah book!,I've read many of Oprah's books and found most of them well written but sooooo depressing. This one is no exception. Astrid's search for love absolutely grabs your heart and squeezes til you can't even breathe. Ambiguous ending leaves one dissatisfied. Adios Oprah!
5,From a former foster youth,"I'm a former foster youth (19 years old) and I am absolutely floored with how accurately Janet Fitch depicts the foster care experience. I've lived through 19 homes and tears came to my eyes as Janet touched experiences that struck home to me. All the homes (save Claire's) are realistic, believe me! Even with the caring Claire's home, we are given meat. We are shown the beauty of an ideal foster parent, the kind we veteran foster youth dream of.This book is exactly what American's should be reading. Too few people fathom, let alone understand, what a crisis the foster system is in today. This book not only opens the door, but it does it engagingly. Its a page turner.If you want to learn about the foster care system, and you don't like getting bored, read this book."
1,one star is one star too many for this,"I read the first 41 pages of White Oleander & decided to give up, it was so boring. The language was not appealing or descriptive, more like excess baggage---get to the point! I could not care for the mother or daughter character at all. They seemed so distant & apathetic to their own lives. I have read many of Oprah's picks & this one was a huge disappointment, as was River Cross My Heart. Guess I'll read Tara Road again."
2,Don't like the genre,"I think the reason I did not like this book is because I don't like the genre - alternative hippies or poor trashy people mad at society, always assuming any sort of conformity is evil and wasting all their lives trying to ""find themselves"". The writer seems to be very talented and if you don't mind these type of characters, I'm sure it's an excellent book. But with the exception of the little girl, who I'll only hope grows up to not be like her mother, that's the setting. I ready about 50 pages and think I'll just move on to something else."
2,Kinda disapointed,"Oprah raved so much about this book on her show, that I couldn't wait to get it. True it was very poetic and lyrically beautiful, but that was all it was. The story itself was nothing new, and that was disapointing."
5,Characters that you will become emotionally involved with.,"This book was worthy of the time it takes to read. It was very involving. The characters were well rounded and the storyline real. The author obviously spent time researching to make this fictional work seem factual and realistic.All those Australian readers out there, spend the $22.95 it's a real treat. Julia"
3,Good,"I believe that thanks to Oprah this first novel by Janet Fitch will turn into a best seller. Whether it deserves to merits some debate. I found the opening 100 pages quite good but when the main characters mother is sent away to prison I found myself longing for her to come back for the next 300 pages. It has some very good parts, is entertaining but I have read better. Try Elinor Lipman next time."
3,Keep away from the audio version,"5 stars for the story; 1 star for the performance. After reading some of the glowing comments that have been posted, I have to write my review regarding the audio version because the story was done a great disservice by Oprah Winfrey's terrible reading performance. Often lapsing into an inexplicable ""honey chile"" Southern accent or a fake ""la-di-da"" upper class eastern accent, Ms. Winfrey did not give any character a single sustainable (and therefore recognizable) voice. In fact, the main characters had so many different voices, depending on Ms. Winfrey's mood at the time, that it was sometimes hard to figure out who was speaking. She never found the North European/Southern California voice that permeates the words of the book. I know Ms. Winfrey has done a lot to bring public notice to many deserving books (including this one), but when it comes to reading, she should let the pros do the books on tapes."
3,It was just okay...nothing great.,I found the book sad and disheartening. I prefer to read books that are more uplifting and positive.
3,"Very interesting, but the language got in the way at times!","I enjoyed this book however, I found myself skipping lines because there were times when I felt the author was trying too hard to be poetic. I was intrigued by the girl's experience but her bad luck was so emotionally draining at times thatI had to skip reading the book on somedays."
1,PARENTS BEWARE!!!,"This book was placed in the hands of my daughter by a student teacher. It explicitly describes several sexual perversions, endorses drug abuse, discloses suicide options, bashes God, and is full of profanity. It has since been removed from our public school library for its obscenities."
5,i want more!,"My only disappointment is that there isn't more from Fitch to read! Her writing style is poignant and harsh in a engaging way! I loved this book, not only for the devious characters but for the unique way it was written.BEWARE: the movie, will still entertaining, hacks characters out of the plot!"
1,This book was a dissappointment,"I have read three of the Oprah bookclub books and won't read another. White Orleander was something I kept reading thinking it would have some redeeming value otherwise Oprah wouldn't have stamped her approval to it. I heard some reviews and women raved about how the author opened their eyes to look at the world differently. To me, their coments were like saying a porno wasn't so bad because it had good music. The book was tasteless. The topic was not uplifting at all, there was no social value to be gained. It was trash."
2,"Predictable, drawn out, lacking excitement",This was one of the most boring books I have ever read. Had difficulty picking it up again after putting it down. I only kept reading it because I thought for sure there was going to some kind of suprise in store for the reader. Did not happen. I found the story unrealistic; one foster home disaster after another. This was the first book I have read from Oprah's recommendations. I found myself even wondering if Oprah had actually read this book. What did Oprah find appealing about this book.
3,"Good, but not to the last drop!","I first found the book to be irrisistible, couldn't put it down. Then I began to feel like she was beating a dead horse. The last two chapters for me were sooo dispointing. I am sorry I finished it.....I should have made up my own ending."
4,Good book,"I really liked White Oleander. This was a fast paced interesting book almost all of the way through. The author could have left maybe the last 50 pages or so out. The book was great up until the last few chapters, and then it became repetetive. I would recommend this book though, and did pass it along."
5,Beautiful,"I read this book when I was in college, it was one of my absolute favorites. Granted it is not the most cheerful book on the shelves, as many people have pointed out, but the characters and the struggles feel very real, not the stuff of made-for-tv melodrama. Astrid is an unlikely, imperfect hero but this only served to make the story come to life for me. The coming of age theme is portrayed a bit differently here but is still as universal as ever."
4,Enjoyable summer read,"Janet Fitch's rich imagery and flowing descriptions are at times a little too drawn out but the plot and well developed characters make the book hard to put down. My sister just become a foster mother and unfortunately ""Astrid's"" life experience is not unique. Sometimes depressive...but it's a book that you'll think about long after the last page."
3,Another depressing Oprah pick.,"Fitch did an outstanding job of developing the realistic characters in White Oleander. The theme is clearly one that we have often seen in Oprah's book selections that revolve around the ugliness of life and the ability for some to cope. I found it extremely depressing and when I finished it, I wondered what Fitch was trying to tell her readers. She made it clear that life can be very difficult and that bad things continue to happen. She also reinforced the fact that people can not rely on those people that are supposed to take care of them and serve as role models. I prefer more inspiring messages."
4,are there mothers like this out there?,"Having a wonderful mother, I find it a little hard to believe and comprehend motives of women who don't respect or show love to their children. Needless to say if I was Astrid, I would be keeping clear of her mother, Ingrid!I felt great empathy for Astrid, being ripped here and there, finding unlikely allies and friends along the way, love in the wrong places with the wrong people.... and I felt despair for her when she concluded that she was scarred on the inside, so she might as well show them on her skin. I was glad when Paul returned to the story as I liked his character.This story just seemed a little too long for me, it could have easily been 50 pages shorter and arrived at the same conclusions. Still it was an interesting eye opener into the world of 'lost children'."
3,Becoming a little disappointed in Oprah's book selections,"When I was given ""White Oleander"" as a gift, I was very excited because I had watched Oprah raving about it on her show. I enjoyed Janet Fitch's writng but I was disappointed in the content of the novel. I found Astrid's character to be too profound and insightful for a 12-17 year old girl. Her insights about her mother and her foster families were too unbelievable. This was on my mind throughout the whole book and I found it difficult to relate to her and her situation. The writing deserves 5 stars."
4,Well read and captivating.,"Oprah did a great job telling this story. I could really feel myself in each place the young girl lived, and I could almost cry each time there was a change in her life. It really captured me. The writer is very descriptive and precise. But I must say I was somewhat disappointed at the ending, not because it wasn't good, but because I wanted for more."
5,Pretty Good,"This is one of the best lego sets i've ever had. The wings are a bit flimsy, but if you put them on tight, they won't come of without being banged around. overall, i'd give it 9 out of 10."
4,Very durable CD Wallet,The material and make are really good. The CD pages are not at all flimsy. The only draw back to the cast is that the pages aren't removeable. I like how it contains a small cloth to clean the CDs.
3,CD Album overpriced about 1000 percent,"These albums (which are made in China) are given away for free in China when you buy 10 copy DVD's. The DVD's cost about a dollar each, so for a $10 purchase you get one of these for free. Must be quite a markup to get to $25."
3,"Not bad, but don't rely on it","The book was a good read. It really explains the whole deal but only in a practical sense. You will get a good understanding of Proxy but if you are looking to pass 70-088, you will need more than the book. There are topics on the test that are not covered in the book and it would be in anybodys best interest to use multiple sources to study. I used the book, Technet documents and Transcenders (as a study guide, DONT JUST LEARN THE QUESTIONS). By using multiple study sources the test is relatively easy. I got an 867. In taking sample questions, I studied the subjects that I was weak in. I found many topics missing from the book. Good luck to all"
1,Are you kidding us?,"Don't ask me how I was duped into buying this one. I am ashamed. I read on the label web site that Lansing-Dreiden is a corporation? Not a band? I don't really have enough energy to get a handle on what this pseudo-intellectual mumbo jumbo is all about, particularly considering the fact that the record seems to be little more than an impersonal, rock genre study at best. This ""corporation"" seems to be playing some kind of joke on an audience it will never have --- ""ha ha ha ....we can make music that sounds vaguely like Duran Duran and Miami Vice and put it on one record!""....is this funny? A Google of Lansing Dreiden seems to suggest art world or art school origins ....which makes sense. Pretentious BS."
5,"Yoda, Dooku, Geonosian Speeder, Crane= Best EP2 lego","YESSSSSSS!!! A Yoda/Dooku lego that represents the battle at the end of EP2. Very cool detail on Yoda, and the Dooku mini-fig is pretty cool, the schimatar-handled saber is a great feature. The crane is awesome, and if you put Obi Wan and Anakin near it, it's just like the scene where Yoda's lifting it from almost crushing them. Endless fun, really cool set, not extremely educational, but it's still pretty cool."
2,Lacking Support,"The design of this bra should lend itself to great support. However, somehow, it still manages to be flimsy and floppy. I don't mind wearing a bra that is essentially unattrative if it gives great support and shaping under clothing. This bra gives poor support and shape and is ugly to boot!"
3,Women Don't Know..........,"I just felt that this book only told about the situation, (which I do find is the case in my experience as a women--basically I shut down when it comes to negotiation, and my boyfriend welcomes it, saying that ""everything is negotiable"". Problem is shown, without any real solutions--basically some people are more assertive than others I guess. Thanks anyway."
1,should give book to celebs only!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS BOOK IT NOT FOR YOUR AVERAGE WEDDING, VERY DISAPPOINTING.WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY."
4,Masterpiece?,"Roger Ebert described this movie as a masterpiece. While I agree with many of Mr. Ebert's reviews, I'll respectfully disagree on this one. It has an mediocre plot about a man who is released from prison and is invited to live with his brother and his two sons. The older son has been labeled as a trouble maker and the other one has a bad habit of eating things like mud and paint. There is some bad blood between the two brothers that leads to murder and the two boys go on the run with a stash of gold coins their father had hidden away. The movie is filmed in rural Georgia and is intent on showing life on ""the wrong side of the the tracks"". The acting is universally good and the story kept my interest, but I found it depressing and vaguely unnerving. The ending was uplifting, but not enough to boost it from 4 stars to 5. If you like to be entertained with lots of stunts, explosions & special effects, this movie isn't for you."
5,80's great show with a touch of Sci-fi and ACTION!!!!!!,"I like Street hawk series. Back in 1985 and 1986, I remember watching this ABC show on Friday night. This show has action, suspense, and comedy(more on the cheesy side). The quality of the DVD is okay of the time period( remember most TV show from the 80's were tape using poor quality film). One thing, some(not all) of the music(popular songs from the 80's) in certain scenes have been replaced with generic music (I think, not 100% sure). Beside that I would recommend this DVD set to anyone who is a Fan of Streethawk or if you like any of the 80's action series(A-Team, Airwolf, Knight Rider, Powers of Matt Starr, and etc). I miss the 80's ( I HATE REALITY TV BIG TIME!!!!!!!!!)."
3,Worth buying for 2 tracks,"Like most everyone else who has reviewed this, I have been listening to this album for years and am glad to see it in CD form. However, only two tracks are really great - Dark as a Dungeon and the heartbreaking Deportee, which has me weeping every time. These two tracks are so wonderful they are worth the price of the CD."
4,Very Informative,"I am an assiduous student who is working to get into Princeton University. This book is mostly for those wanting into Dartmouth, but it can surely be applied to other colleges as well. The thing that was best was an explanation of the AI (Academic Index). Ms. Hernandez, however, was a less than adequate writer. Her writing was not very good, as is testified by other reviewers before me. Still, it was a good book, well worth 4 stars."
5,Save Yourself Hours of Research,"As a parent with a son who wants to attend an ivy league school, I've done a ton of research. After all, we all want our kids to have every opportunity to pursue their dreams. The information found in this book summarizes most everything I've had to find the hard way. It also contains the information everyone wants to know; that being, the real criteria used for admissions, and what can be done to present an application in the best possible light. Additionally, the book presents a realistic view of an ivy league education. It explains that the value of an ivy league education is largely in the exhilariting educational environment, rather than the status it lends or the economic benefit it may (or may not) bring. I wish this had been the first book I read, instead of the tenth. If you are applying to highly selective colleges right now, I guarantee this will help you."
5,A step by step guide book,I purchased A is for Admission in my son's freshman year of high school and followed it every step of the way. The step by step advice was extremely valuable and kept him on the right track. He is now a senior and was accepted to an Ivy League College. Thank you Ms. Hernandez.
5,Excellent Theory and Perspective for All Admission Applicants,"In ""A Is for Admission"" Michele A. Hernández provides a real world perspective for college admission students. In the college admission writing process it is necessary to engage the reader with clear concise communication, follow the formal academic structure guidelines, and include the theory that the admissions officers seek, all by connecting through the admissions perspective. The people granting your admission must connect with what they are reading before they will place your application in the ""accepted"" category.This undergraduate communication professor and The College Student Coach highly recommends ""A Is for Admission"" to all of her college student admissions clients.synergyintuitivecoaching.comcollegestudentcoaching@gmail.com"
4,Very helpful,"I definitely appreciated this candid look at the admissions process of the Ivy League, and actually found it rather reassuring- Hernandez goes a good job of dispelling the paranoid rumors that have been spreading around my high school, (like, we'll be at a disadvantage because of our state, etc) and also provides the much-desired AI formula. However, I have a feeling that as admissions standards are rising, the formula has lost accuracy. For example, when I plugged in my scores and GPA, I came out as slightly above average for accepted Dartmouth students. I know for a fact that this has changed! My only reservation at giving the full five stars is that I don't believe Hernandez fufilled her promise of providing tricks to raise your AI."
2,"Good, but not enough.","It does give you some hints, but it isn't that technical. It's more an ""imitate me"" book than a ""understand it"" book. To me it wasn't very illustrative...The exercises are a little bit ridiculous, so it's kind of hard to try to practice if you don't want to bother any nearby person or neighbor, or if you get easily embarrassed.Right now I'm reading ""The New Voice: How to Sing and Speak properly"" and it seems more reasonable, it talks about making your voice before singing, instead of making it as you sing... like in this book.I will give it a 2, because it does help you improve, but this book doesn't cover the ""understand everything that is happening"" part good enough for me."
5,"Dee Lundgren, counselor in Langhorne, P",Great book. A very practical book that takes you through the exercises that will help a person to develop a better speaking and singing voice. There is a great CD that occupanies the exercises so that you don't just need to read about them. The author boasts that he has trained many famous speakers and has had great success in helping them develop their voices. I'm not a singer but would like to enhance my speaking voice since I talk with clients and also do public speaking. This book was just what I needed.
1,"Mr. Love, not an authentic expert.......................","I am sure that Mr. Love is passionate about what he does. I would not consider him to be an expert concerning the voice, nor does he demonstrate the correct training and understanding of what happens physiologically. Dr. Morton Cooper on the other hand is an expert. How many of Mr. Love's clients have had to go through voice rehabilitation?Change Your Voice : Change Your Life : A Quick, Simple Plan for Finding & Using Your Natural Dynamic VoiceWinning with Your Voice"
4,I recommend this book,"I picked this book up on a whim, and I was very pleased to read that someone had put together a book that contains much of my own philsophy of teaching voice. I'm only giving it 4 stars because the name-dropping throughout the book is irritating at best, and as some others have noted, his descriptions of what the vocal folds are doing during vibrato, etc. are not very scientific or accurate; however, the descriptions do help with visiualizations and it truly isn't necessary to know the science to learn to sing well.Other things I like about the book are:-connecting the speaking voice to the singing voice-encouraging people to train their own ears by recording themselves-exploring the middle voice-the ""do-it-yourself/imitation"" approach; this works for many peopleIt's good that a CD is included; it really helps people hear the difference between doing it wrong and doing it right.This is a good place to start if you want to learn to sing."
1,Unimpressive,"A surprisingly juvenile book of stories that only loosely connects itself to the Gulf War--the humour is embarrassingly weak, the writing is steeped in cliche, the political references are thin and empty. Without that linking motif of the Gulf War, this book would be seen for what it is, a barely capable, immensely derivative, work of fiction by a young writer blissfully unaware of how sentimental he is."
2,Would be great if it stayed together,"I got this for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas. It's a cool looking toy and he enjoys it, but it isn't very sturdy. He plays like any other kid and it just falls apart on him. He gets frustrated with it very quickly but really likes it at the same time. It is a neat toy and I'm glad I only paid $13 on black friday other wise I'd be extremely disappointed. So....my over all opinion is that is really isn't worth the hassle."
1,I hate t rex mountain,"Don't buy this toy unless it is for a 15 year old who can rebuild it himself everytime it breaks. It's great to look at, but don't make any sudden movements! My son received this as a Christmas gift. I was crushed to discover it in a million pieces that needed to be assembled. I knew it would not survive my 3 year old. He begged me to put it together, so I finally did. Two hours later. It fell apart at the very end when I tried to put all the plants and accessories on. Fell apart again when I moved it to his bedroom. He now probably knows every curse word and then some. I know that I sound crazy, but I need to vent. How else can you get revenge on a toy, but give it a bad review?"
1,Keeps falling apart,"This toy looks like it could be alot of fun... if it would stay together. I like the super glue idea. I play with the kids and even it breaks apart from a 30 year old mom playing with and I think my motor control is just fine. I can't even pick it up to put it back on the shelf without the bottom ""pond"" falling apart. Just don't waste your money on this."
1,Very Sad Disappointment for Dinosaur Lovers Birthday,"My daughter is a dinosaur fanatic and was so excited to get t-rex mountain on her birthday. It took me over an hour to put it together and with the cool sound effect I thought it would be so much fun. I am not kidding when I say that it literally falls apart whenever you touch it. I could not find any way to keep it together. Very disappointing to spend that money on something that is sitting in pieces all over the floor. I hate to write anything negative about a toy, but, I really felt that I should warn any parent who is about to spend their hard earned money on this item. I would put the money towards some of the cool dinosaurs they have out and even some animated ones. DO NOT waste your money!"
2,NOT USER FRIENDLY,"I purchased this item for my 4, almost 5 year old, for Christmas and have seen him play with it, maybe twice since then. My 2 year old loves to tear it down which in turn means that I have to reassemble it since there is no way a 4 or even 5 year could do so. I have to makesure I am constantly reading the directions in order to get it back together. There are multiple ""set ups"", but the instruction book only provides detailed instructions for the set-up pictured on the box and on amazon. I would recommend this toy for older children, maybe between the ages of 10 and 12 due to the level of assembly. The added accessories do not really stay on...and typically pop off once you think you have them assembled. As an earlier review stated...it is very cool to look at, but unless you are going to put it in a safe place after assembly...not so user friendly...for the ""user"" that is intended, (i.e. small children)."
1,"Poor, poor offering from Imaginext","I chose the title I did because I didn't think that piece of monkey excrement would clear filters. I have seen many imaginext sets and have liked all of them until we opened the box on this one. Its in 10,000 pieces, literally. The screws are too small and strip out. There are entirely too many pieces that can fall apart. The set is supposed to be ""interchangeable"" but there are too many components that work in tandem for this to really be the case. I am really disappointed in this set. My advice, is to either buy some super glue or just give your kid a cardboard box and some crayons. Not only would it be more fun than this contraption, it would cause less frustration on mom and dad..."
3,Do NOT throw away the directions,"We bought this for our 5 year old. Although he loves the dinosaurs, the mountain itself has been pretty disappointing. It has a ton of pieces and very specific instructions. Unfortunately, it's also top heavy and falls over and apart easily. He hasn't played with it much because it's such a pain to rebuild constantly. It's also pretty tall to store while it's fully assembled."
3,"Good toy, but comes apart too easily","This is a great toy if you have a child that likes to put pieces together and does not get frustrated easily. We have had this toy 2 years and have used it a fair amount, but I wish the pieces would stay together better, once put together. There really is no reason why it should come apart, other than storage. You can reconfigure the pieces, but it really works best put together the same way each time. Wish it were sturdier, but the kids still love the chomping sounds and tunnels."
2,"not ""like new""","I bought a book from these guys that was described as ""used--like new."" It was not. The binding, front and back cover had sticky black marks on them. The rest of it was in reasonable shape, so it wasn't worth a return, but watch out for their potentially misleading descriptions."
5,We Need more Donny Osmonds in this world.,"I applaud Donny. I read his book within 2 days and I started reading it again. As a child in the 60's I was teased for loving Donny and I don't regret it. Admiring and following the Osmond family, and the support of my own loving family, kept me straight and out of trouble all my life. Donny shouldn't have to be embarassed about being Donny Osmond. With the way children are teased and abused and victimized by other children in today's world, the kids today should read his book and learn how such actions could affect someone. If they are the ones being teased, then follow his footsteps in dealing with verbal and emotional abuse by society. Maybe if more people read his book they will think twice about not accepting people for who they are. I hope Donny writes additional books in the future, he is as talented in writing as he is in entertaining."
5,Amazing...I couldn't put it down!,"I have been a fan of The Osmond's for 30+ years now and this book shed alot of light on the trials and tribulations of being Donny Osmond...a talented man who never quite got the respect he so well deserves.I have just returned from a book signing with Donny, whom I've had the pleasure of meeting many tmes before, and felt compelled to thank him for all the wonderful memories and music that he and his family gave not only to me, but to thier legions of fans.If you're a child of the 70's or just enjoy Donny's talk show, take the time to read about the man and his life...you won't regret it. I personally poured over this one in 3 nights...a fabulous read if there ever was one!"
4,worth reading,Donny doesn't sugar-coat his life and career. I appreciated his honesty and enjoyed learning more about this talented performer and his fascinating experiences in show biz. An excellent read.
5,Different kind of approach,"There are many books, arguably too many, that focus almost explicitly with Monkees history. This book is different. If you really look at what the contributors in this book write, you can actually see the history of the Monkees FAN through the years--from those who discovered the show on a September evening in 1966, to those who found them through the 80's MTV wave of Monkeemania, to those who have recently found the Monkees through recent reunion tours and related projects. After reading the stories of all these dyed in the wool Monkeeholics, it will become no surprise to you why the guys have so positively affected so many people, and why their fans are so loyal. I was glad to help you out, Ed...best of luck with this!"
1,Worst Movie of 2002,"I love movies, but never have I been more pained than watching this one. Kieran Culkin plays Igby, a spoiled rich kid who has nothing better to do than whine and complain about how stupid life is. He is a wannabe Holden Caulfield. But while Holden was intelligent and likeable, Igby is just down right annoying. Along the way he meets characters who are so pretentious by trying to be weird and strange.I really wanted to like this movie. The title is very interesting and the cast made me want to see it. But I must tell you that I wanted to walk out of this movie thirty minutes into it. It is so horrible. Ryan Philipe is flat as the older brother and Susan Sarandon's talents are simply wasted. A terrible, terrible film."
4,"Excellent ""Catcher""","""Igby"" has a quick wit and darkly comic mentality that set it apart from just about everything I've seen lately. Unlike most black comedies that are anything but funny, ""Igby,"" partly due to its terrific cast, delivers a funny, sardonic, surprisingly poignant look at a very messed up family.If it is a rip-off of ""Catcher in the Rye,"" at least it's a good one. Despite a lack of confidence on my part with the acting abilities of Ryan Phillipe and Kieran Culkin, they delivered great performances, as did Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes and a host of peripheral characters."
3,good but you shouldnt watch this again,"the first view of this one if great but ones who see it again and again and again are gonna get bored out of their frickin skull. Culkin does a great job as Igby. Phillippe and Danes spark good supportees. Bill Pullman is gold and on the money as the skitzo dad. I was glad when Phillippe put a plastic wrap over Sarandon's head, she was annoying and Peet sheds some chest scenes as well"
4,Igby Goes all the way!!,"Igby Slocumb, a rebellious and sarcastic seventeen year-old boy, played by Kieran Culkin, is at war with the oppressive world of his family. His father is schizophrenic, his mother is cold and distant, and his big brother is an arrogant wannabe aristocrat. Igby figures there must be a better life out there, and he sets out to find it. After flunking out of several Prep Schools, Igby escapes into the bohemian underworld of Manhattan. His darkly comic trip, which he share with a deviant cast of characters, including his terminally bored, part-time lover Sookie, his Godfater's mistress Rachel, and drug dealing performance artist Russel, veers from bizarre to tragic in Igby's ultimately noble attempt to keep himself from ""going down."" This film has a stellar cast, an amazing script, and superb direction. It is quite possibly one of the best films to come out of 2002."
5,"Dark, funny, moving and briliant!","Igby is, in an age of over-hyped blockbusters, pretentious Roads to Perdition, bloated Chicagos and solipsitic Adaptations, quite simply, the real thing. The wittiest script since The Graduate, maybe All About Eve! And ultimately full of real people who break your heart. Every performance is pitch perfect. Of, course, the real credit goes to Mr Steers, who has created a Holden Caulfield for the new millenium. I cannot praise this work of art enough!-- Nicky Silver"
1,More teen pap,"I'm wondering if the people here reviewing this movie saw the same film as I. I've never been in a movie theater where half the audience walked out, until ""Igby Goes Down"". I should have followed their example really...I can think of nothing to recommend this movie whatsoever. I love Claire Danes and Susan Sarandon, but even they couldn't hold my attention away from the fact that this movie isn't entertainment, it's not thought-provoking - it's just nothing! I thought ""Vanilla Sky"" was self-indulgent, but I'd watch that 100 times over before seeing this again.Don't get me wrong: I can deal with teen movies, and I'm a fan of ""Catcher in the Rye,"" but this movie is the most pretentious [movie] imaginable. I didn't care about the story, and I certainly didn't care about the characters. I also don't care to see a poor little rich boy's ""struggle."" To those saying this is believable, I can only ask which world they live in! I want my money back!"
1,Psychobabble new-age mood-ring music,"Yuck! This disk has so much echo-chamber effects on it that it reminds me of the Lennon Sisters from Lawrence Welk!! Lyrics like ""all limitations are self-imposed"" say it all. Lots of sound effects cover up the fact that there isn't much melody either. Maybe a few teen-age girls will find it meaningful."
1,Heavy Piece of Excrement,"The kind of exploitation Kurt deplored.So much made up information in this book, it made me jump out of my chair and pound the wall. Where the author couldn't get the facts, he invented them. I know. I was there during Kurt's short life. Those who turned down Mr.Cross for an interview were punished by being specifically targeted as villains or crazies. Mr. Cross was successful in one aspect, and that was to nail those book readings. Congratulations, Mr. Cross for adding more salt into one family's wounds. RIP, Kurt."
1,Too much fiction,"This book read like a novel, not a biography. Too much guessing and errors make this a book to pass up for sure. I thought this would be a great read. It read more like a tabloid newspaper."
3,"Awesome info on Kurt, but the ending is all wrong.","The information you get on Kurt's life is awesome. A lot of stuff from his journals is put in, and the ""time line"" format is great. The problem is the ending. ... Buy the book for the information about Kurt's life...but not about his death. Or Rome."
2,One of the best,"Ive read many books on the life of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana. I have to say that this is one of the best. I couldnt put it down.However with that said. I refer any future readers/buyers to the post below from Brieann Oonner (Kurts half sister) Even if it isnt the real Brieann i still think that she has a fair point. People should allow Kurt to rest in peace. Insetead of writing books and making profit off them. Im repulsed by Courtney Love releasing his journals, and the Seattle Police Department for releasing things like incident reports, snapshots and for not re-opening this case and giving Kurt the justice he deserves.So a final word to Kurts family and loved ones. Keep going strong, take back the Cobain estate and hand anything about Nirvana over to Dave and Krist.SincerelyAn Australian Nirvana Fan."
2,Heavier then Heaven Review,The book is average at best. I expected alot better when i paid $50 for it but I was pretty dissapointed.
2,Not pleased.,I was not pleased with this cook book. Despite all the positive reviews I was disappionted. When I first saw the recipe using a can of soup I knew it wasn't for me. I do love the Sopranos but as far as cooking goes I will look elsewhere for my Italian recipes.
3,Would Tony Soprano Like This Book??,"From Frankie Frog Eye's ""Organized Cooking"": ...Okay, so at this point in checking things out, I'm sure you realize that I'm very worried about reading the recipes, right? Right. So I put the book down for a while, take a few glasses of Brioschi and try to think about something else. The first thing that comes into my mind is the time I put my glasses on my ten-month-old nephew Rosario and he screwed up his face like the world had gone haywire and crawled into a wall. I almost bust a gut, but I think you had to be there.So I start to read some of the recipes: Marinara Sauce, Sunday Gravy, Linguine con Vongole, Pizza, Pork Chops with the Vinegar Peppers. Basic stuff. But guess what? The recipes are all pretty accurate! There are even one or two made exactly the way I make mine! Thank goodness for Michele Scicolone and her recipes!..."
4,traditional old world family cusine,"For those of you that can't find the one or two recepies you have been looking for over the years, this is the book. If you follow the recepie, your efforts will be rewarded with a fine entree you will be proud to serve."
5,Fantastic presentation and taste!,"Before I even got my book I made ""Quail a la Sinatra"", as it was offered for free on the page advertising the book. The recepe was easy, and after substituting cornish hens for the quail, the ingredients were too. The dish was out of this world and looked as if Artie Bucco himself was going to bring it to the table. In addition, even little kids liked it although the flavors were sophistocated. My husband and I enjoyed it so much, we served it to company a week later to oohs and aahs."
1,Yuck,"As an Italian-American, I cringe at anything associated with the continued presentation of this ethnic group as stupid, violent, abusive gangsters. Why other Italian-Americans want to take part in and further promote this stereotype is beyond me."
1,Oh my god is this movie dumb,"First time I have ever bothered to review anything, anywhere but this movie was so bad that I had to do it. This film is such an amazing mix of creepy and stupid that I really wonder what the actors were thinking when they signed up for it. Spoiler alert : there's a ridiculously long and tedious sequence involving a power gun. I used to think Javier Bardem was hot. Not anymore."
2,Waste of time and talent,"If you rent this for a buck, you MIGHT not be disappointed - it all depends on your expectations of a movie which stars two superb actors: hilary swank and jeffrey dean morgan. and like a previous reviewer stated, the cinematography, score, direction, are all above average. what's totally subpar is the absolutely derivative writing and lack of any real character dimension(s). For what you would assume would be a highly intelligent person in the role of an ER doctor, Ms. swank acts completely doofus while mr. morgan wanders around like an updated quasimodo...the only exciting(and hardly that!) moments occur during the last 10 or so minutes of the film - but you already knew what was coming - unless you fell asleep much earlier!! the two stars are for the two stars; without them carrying the movie, this would be a total and utter disrespect for one's own time...."
2,"""Resident"" evil","We who were happy to see Hammer resurrected after thirty film-less years may wish it'd stayed dead after seeing ""The Resident,"" the first film produced by the notorious schlock-gothic-horror production company since the 1970s. There are two core faults. The first is the casting of Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the antagonist. Morgan is just too lovable, too blindingly charismatic, to play a character we're supposed to fear or hate, although Morgan's performance is almost astonishingly good considering the material. The second is the script: co-written by the film's ruthlessly unimaginative director, Antti Jokinen (this is his first film), the story was a dead horse two decades ago, and the writers can't even fathom why it might need to be injected with something fresh or original. Who can't predict every point of the plot progression? ""The Resident"" is offensively dull, a sure disappointment for Hammer fans. On the upside, Christopher Lee is amusing."
4,The Resident - 4 out of 5 stars,"I watched this movie on a dark and stormy night! What fun, as it added to the heart-pounding factor.It's not a jumpy movie and it does not take long to figure out what is going on, but all-in-all it was a fun movie.Jeffrey Dean Morgan was hard to watch. After seeing him in other films, I am not sure I loved him being the 'bad guy', but he was outstanding.Remember, always look under your bed before you go to sleep.(Do not judge the movie to harshly. The ending could have been a little better, but it was a fun film)"
1,Bad,Bought this DVD thinking it would be pretty good since I like movies that are a little scary but filled with suspense. What a disappointment. Ended up throwing this DVD in the garbage. That's how bad it was in my opinion.
3,The Resident,"Why is there a horse in the lead?(No Pun),makes for a good movie but we have seen these plots before,predictable and repetitive.Did I mention Hillary Swank?She leads on some guy in the movie,and turns out the guy is pretty demented,and of course by the cover you can tell what happens next.Christopher Lee is Great but The return of Hammer Films could have been better."
3,It falls apart... (2.5/5),"The Resident is about a landlord that is obsessed with his new tenant. It started off well, but ended terribly.What did I like? It had some great tension; every time he was creeping through the apartment, I felt the suspense and was always asking ""will be get caught?"". The acting was decent. Overall, I really liked the first half of the movie.What did I dislike? The ending was terrible. It quickly changes from a creepy little movie to a very generic slasher. You'll be able to guess every twist and turn; it looks like that killed him, he pops up somewhere else, repeat (like a Friday the 13th movie). It was also a very abrupt ending. Overall, a terrible second half.Overall, I don't recommend directly paying to watch this movie. If you want to watch it, it's available on Netflix Streaming so save some money.This movie has brief nudity, sex, violence and blood."
4,Tasty Even for a Chocoholic,"My Dad has mild diabetes but loves chocolate. My mother will not let him bring any chocolate into the house. When I found these cookies, I hoped they would make them both happy. I got a subscription for these cookies to be send every month for a few months. My Dad, who is a man of few words only said ""Yeah, I got the cookies"". But when the subscription ended, he asked when his cookies were coming again. That's the best endorsement - the chocoholic wanted more of these cookies!"
4,Great tasting for a sugar free cookie,"These wafers are a tasty treat for those of us who need/want to avoid sugar. My body cannot handle much refined sugar so I am always lookging for a substitute when everyone else is having a dessert that I cannot eat. The taste to me is just fine. I also grab one or two whenever I feel the need for a quick sweet-Fifty-50 Sugar Free Chocolate Wafers, 3.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8)tasting snack."
4,How Eddie and I are Alike.,"I started to like the book from the begining. I liked the way Gary Soto wrote Eddie's {the main character} feelings. I liked how short it was, and the way he mixes with Spanish and the English.I like the way Eddie tries to keep his nose out of trouble, but bad things happen to him anyway. Sometimes, it is not his fault.That happens to kids like me, too. Onions to Eddie might be the ghosts of family and friends and he sees them when it's hot out and it's just get done raining, the steam rises from the ground. I liked the way he got a job rather than get into a gang. But when he was so tired he said ""I forced myself, pushed on the pedal, because like that red ant, I had top come home with my own crumbs.""I think teenagers should read about this book and think about this book."""
5,Perfect,I loved it I was so happy when I got it I looked for years for that cd and my wife told me to look on your website because she order a movie from you so she look it up and there it was so thank so much
1,Virtually a keyboard,The first one I received would work for ~15 minutes and then all the lights would come on and it would lock up. It did this on 3 different computers. The replacement didn't lock up but only half of the keys would register without significant pressure on the keys(as in old manual typewriter.) Forget about touch-typing with that. Looks like a good idea but the quality control needs serious improvement.
2,No so much,"I had an old ""Virtually indestructible keyboard"" It worked great until the left control key died. I had it quite a few years so it wasn't a big deal to replace it. The new one totally sucks the space bar never works and there is a bit of air trapped in making bubble up. I'd rather type on my cell phone."
2,My kids destroyed it in about two weeks.,It is spill proof. The buttons tend to fall off the keyboard unless you are a careful adult. This is a difficult to use keyboard.
5,"Yeah, what they said. :-)","A well-written, entertaining book, with excellent training advice-- even long-time dog owners might pick up something new. Highly recommended."
5,It's like literary candy ...,"The book is a pure joy. Browsing is such fun. The layout puts all you need, usually, on a two page spread. How easy and obvious it makes my dog, now that I know the way he thinks. Thanks for the treat and the appoarch. Praise works wonders. I wonder if our bosses know this?"
5,A must-have book!,This is a great book! I've read a lot of books on puppy training since this is the first time we own a puppy and don't know anything about him. This book opened my eyes. Brian really understands dogs! I espeally like some of the tricks that puppy corrects his behaviour himself. I just need to setup the scene and praise the puppy when he stops wrong behavior. A must read book!
4,"Good Owners, Great Dogs",Enjoyed the guidance and insight into the psychology of learning from the dogs point of view. It immediately had positive effect upon my training and my dog's retention.Wish there had been more emphasis and detail on training techniques as the author seemed to generalize alot.
2,Not pleasant,"I was skeptical about ordering this but figured I'd give it a shot since it wasn't that expensive. As I first started using it I thought it was great. But, after I did part of my leg and had stopped to take a phone call, my leg had a slight burning feeling and itched! I followed the instructions and didn't apply hardly any pressure. The burning and itching, even after applying a ton of lotion, lasted for a few days. I do have pretty dry skin so that may have been part of the problem. Personally, I'd recommend looking for another option."
2,Just like shaving,I was so optimistic about trying this product on my legs. I have coarse hair and I saw no difference between shaving and using this conair hair removal system. My legs were actually smoother when I shaved. I gave this product 2 stars because of the way it removes dead skin but as far as a hair removal system it was a complete failure for me. I still felt a lot of hair stubble... Maybe it has to do with the type of hair I have because I know a lot of people who had this system work for them. I just wish it worked for me :(
1,Hair Removal for Men?,"Total fail. I bought the Conair to remove back and shoulder hair. My results were less than satisfactory. The hairs were cut near skin level, but just high enough to leave little stubby hairs. Results lasted maybe 2 days, and I used up all of the discs included with the system. I guess it is back to waxing."
4,Seems to work OK,"I don't really notice that this removes my hair all that well but then again I have dark coarse hair and maybe this isn't quite up to the task. However, it leaves my skin exfoliated and very smooth. I also notice that using this in between my normal shaving routine helps drastically cut down on my ingrown hairs/shave bumps...maybe due to the exfoliation? So although it doesn't work to remove hair (at least on me) it still has its benefits and for the price its well worth giving it a shot."
1,Waste of money,This item doesn't work at all. At least I can cover the sanding head with a detaling shammy and use it to buff my car outside with an extension cord.
3,"Works as advertised, but . .","Worka well (and does eliminate ingrown hairs as advertised), but incredibly time consuming. I have switched to Veet (Nair) because my skin tolerates it."
2,Had To Be Replaced After 2 Months,I'll begin by saying that I definitely do not recommend this hub. After about 2 months it completely malfunctioned. My pc no longer recognized devices that were connected via the hub. The indicators also stopped illuminating. I replaced it promptly with a D-Link DUB-H7 and have not had any problems. The D-Link has been in service for about 7 months.I'll end by saying that I definitely do not recommend this hub!!!!Good luck with your search...
3,Useful but the Flylight doesn't last very long.,FlyLight on top burned out very soon after purchasing which is too bad since that light was very useful in dark situations and was one of the reasons I bought it.
1,Junk,This product is poorly made. It fell apart. Half of the slots did not work.I sent it back to Kensington for a refund. (The company did stand behind their product and gave me the refund.) NO stars for this one.
3,"OK, but not perfect","The dome shape is nice, and the weight is good, keeping the hub from being flung around by all the cables connected to it. But the LEDs don't really work. Light bleeds from the LEDs that are fully on, making the other ones look dimly on. This wouldn't be so bad except that some of the ones that have things plugged in correctly are only dimly on, so you really can't tell from the LEDs what is going on. Kensington technical support said that they know about the problem and were working on it, but that was a year ago and I haven't heard anything since."
3,"Good looking design, but...","The good looks attracted me, and it worked quite well for a couple of weeks, then it died... Anyone interested in a paper weight?The three stars are for when it it was working. :( ........AK"
1,Don't buy it!,After reading all the reviews I bought this in July. It worked for a grand total of three months.
2,Broken down after 6 months,"I bought this in July 2010. It was very easy to set up and was working fine. Today, after 6 months, all of sudden it just doesn't work. The power indicator was still on but all the devices were plugged in didn't work first. I tried to unplug some devices then all of sudden the power indicator also turned off.It's not a reliable product. Suggest you to consider other options."
2,Poorly updated edition of excellent book,"The earlier editions of this book were one of the best mapping job ever to be found in a trail guide for the West. However, this new edition seems not to have been field-checked. In my neck of the woods (Lassen National Forest) re-routes made a few years ago are left out of the new edition. Specifically, the re-route in Chips Creek is missing. Also, the new view point on Hat Creek Rim is missing, although the old dirt trail was converted to a paved sidewalk for 100 yards. New 1:24,000 maps have been published by the USGS, but Wilderness Press still uses the old 1:62,000 maps in Chips Creek and other places. The earlier editions were nearly flawless, but this effort is Wilderness Press resting on its laurels and re-issuing old material with a new cover."
4,Great for historical knowledge,This book is a good read so far. I heard the author of this book at a conference I attended last year and bought the book out of interest. It is interesting to see how our field has evolved.
5,Enlightening reading! Ricky Watters is the real deal!,"This is definitely not your typical sports autobiography. I finished it in a day. It was entertaining, fun, educational and gave me a heavy dose of reality of life in the N.F.L. The title says it all. I felt as if I were experiencing Ricky Watters' journey first hand and could relate to many of his challenges in life, even though I am not only not a professional athlete, but I am a stay at home mom. I definitely recommend this book and I am going to pass it on to my son, who plays high school sports,as I believe he can benefit from it as well."
4,Balance to Malthusian / Neo-Malthusian Environmentalists,"This volume presents a well reasoned and heavily documented balance to Malthusian and neo-Malthusian authors. Chocked full of statistical data, it is quite at odds with what many of the hyper environmentalists are saying. The author of the epilogue creatively divides the two camps into the doomsayers and the cornucopians, as he seeks for a balance between the two. This is an excellent choice for readers who are concerned about the environment!"
4,"Guns for show, knives for a pro","If you are fed up with tha lousy cues at the local pool club and you are just a person loving the game playing at amateur level, this the cue for you; cheap but still quite good for basic play; one of the few drawbacks are the light weight and bad quality of the coating of the case(it can't stand heat); this things are in the same time neglectable when you have the opportunity to have your own cue to play with; conclusion: great value for the money"
3,Good general reference,"Hits most possible topics of interest, but refrains from going into enough detail about side issues such as: How to do various forms of mounting prints and matting (only skirts dry mounting); print toning, such as Sepia and Selenium techniques; leaves out hand coloring entirely. Excellent job of describing the ""art"" aspects of black and white photography, lots of visual examples."
5,Replacement school Text Book,"My daughter's room is very disorganized and so at the end of the school year when she had to hand in her text books, this one was missing. I bought this one as a replacement for the missing text and of course one year later the original was found behind her desk. The price I paid for the replacement was much less than the school was going to charge for the missing text and was in better condition than the school's text."
4,Great book,I couldn't put the book down when I read it. I thought it was very well written. Well worth the price of a book!
4,"I enjoyed it, but. . .","I enjoyed about ninety percent of this book. The author has a terrific eye for detail and it was like opening a time capsule from the late fifties/early sixties to read this novel (who knew people hated power steering when it first came out, for instance). The characters were believable and the hero sufficiently hard-boiled for the noir label, and I was absorbed in the story from the first paragraph. But it's the last ten percent of the book that will stay with me. The ending of this book is so appalling, so horrifying, so inhumane, that I'm not sure I will ever forget it. It was almost more than I could stand to finish reading the book. An over-reaction? Maybe. And I can't give the book a bad rating because it is so well-written and the story was very good. But that ending...yeesh!"
3,It doesn't give much of a workout,"This was the first step aerobics video I had, so at first I liked it. Then it got really old and I found the instructors to be annoying. Plus, I wasn't getting much of a workout. I then got Kathy Smith's Power Stepping workout, which I liked a lot better. The instructors don't switch so much, and there are more choices as to how hard you want to work."
4,Great Photographs!,"I have always loved David LaChapelles work. He is a fantastic photographer and this book was well worth it. Depending on your taste, i think i prefer his first book to this one, as this one is a little more provocative. But all in all, he is amazing, and anything he does is worth owning."
3,"Doesn't sound too ""Pooish""","The music on this CD doesn't sound like typical Pooh music mainly because most of the songs are performed by the Chieftans. I played this CD for my 4 year old brother, and he didn't really enjoy it that much. The songs without the lyrics sound like songs that could be for adults. Nonetheless, the music isn't horrible."
5,If it makes your 2 and 4 year old dance and sing is it great,We have played the cassette tape version so many times that I am now replacing it. The songs go from sweet and soft to upbeat and silly. My two little ones beg me to play this over and over in the car and at home.
1,THE BOOK OF HELL,"This is by far the worst book i have ever read. I was forced to read it before i went to spain and i cant explain the agony i went through to read this piece. She goes back and forth on all of these tangents and you dont know what she will talk about next. It's HORRIBLE! Do not read this book, you will regret it , unless u are an extemely boring person and this interests you...to all you people who gave this book 5 stars, shame."
5,great abdominal workout,"This is a great video. There is no way that you will not feel these exercises working. I like the fact that this video is only 8 min., sometimes that is only all I have, but in these 8 min. you get a terriffic abdominal workout. The first couple of times I did the workout my neck was sore, even though I was doing the exercises correctly. But my neck got stronger after the first week and it hasn't hurt since. The ab exercises were challenging at first, but after doing them for a week they got easier. Doing this video faithfully 3-5X's per week really stregthens your abdominals and improves posture. You will feel and look better within a month. This video is wonderful, a must have for your abs."
3,Buy the Tape But Not the Diet Aids,"This tape is pretty good, although I prefer the 8 minute abs workout by beachbody. However, if they try to contact you later to send you free diet vitamins, don't take them. You'll soon start getting vitamins every month and find a recurring charge on your credit card that is impossible to get cancelled! (This is NOT something that is done by Amazon.com, which is a GREAT place to buy anything.)"
3,Good Exercises but Gets Boring,"This tape shows you some really great exercises that work one your abs but I found that it took some time even combined with a reduced calorie diet to see real results. I also found that it got boring to do because you are suppose to do it often but its the same thing every time. By the time I stopped doing it I was sick of the music in it, sick of the exercises and the order they went in. But even so, it is a great tape that does show you some good techniques and moves but if you like variety and tire quickly like me I don't reccommend this tape for you."
5,great ab workout,The eight minute ab workout is the same on all three tapes - so choose what extra bonus you want -buns or arms. Good music and on screen count down for each exercise keeps you motivated. Great tape!
2,"Once fat, always fat","""Forever fat: essays from the Godfather"" seems to be the author's clever excuse for proving himself deserving of the positive attention he never received as a child. A universal thread: childhood scars that carry themselves into adulthood. Who hasn't been on the receiving end of a sucker-punch? While I admire Gutkind's honesty, oftentimes at the expense of too much information, I am not convinced that, as a middle-aged man, he's really dealt with any of his demons. In fact, his writing style seems overly structured and forced, and the book reads more as an in-your-face comeback to all the people in his life who've wronged him than a work of literature. And I'm still left confused as to what this problematic genre of creative nonfiction really is, which is perhaps a good thing. This book is a testimony to the statement: you can take the man out of the fat, but you can't take the fat out of the man."
5,"101 of the best, and then some.","When you first open this book you can't help but turn to those shows that have become your favorites. I first turned to Gypsy, then Evita, Phantom, Cats, and on and on. All my favorites were there. Most of them, showed the original cast from the first production.Gypsy featured Ethel Merman as Mama Rose, Sandra Church as Louise/Gypsy in the original production. The book then goes on to other Rose's: Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters. In each case it talks about the unique characterizations brought to the stage by the leading lady.This is typical treatment for this book where most of the plays (the really popular ones) get similar treatment. In addition there are side bars that give details on some of the other people (directors, composers, custome people, etc.) that have made these shows what they are.There's only one problem with the book, you can't put it down. I know, I've tried, and somehow it falls open to My Fair Lady...."
4,Broadway Musicals: The 101 Greatest Shows,"This was a gift for a Broadway buff. She loved the book, but was a little disappointed that ""Rent"" wasn't one of the shows included."
4,Real Tatum but horrible sound quality,"The tracks on the first half of the CD are well known from other publications (though not all, 3 were entirely new for me). The tracks on the second half of the CD (12-21) are so poor in sound quality that you can only recognize the extraordinary capabilities of Tatum if you already knew them. The sound quality suffers from a poor (upright) piano, lots of surround noise and poor recording equipment. The tracks 12-21 are in no way comparable to the Ray Heindorf recordings, that were also taken in a private situation. Ray Heindorf had at least a decent grand piano, and the public was at least willing to be silent. The tracks 12-21 are far worse in sound quality than the private recordings on de well known CD ""God is in the House"". Nevertheless, if you are an admirer of Tatum you should have this CD."
1,extreme caution,"after reading this book, i have found it to be an exact copy of the unsuccessful high fat, ""starvation DIET"" OF THE EARLY 20TH century. controling blood sugar with glucose tablets is not a solution. i would not recommend this book."
5,Both the book and the authors' web site,"This book marked the crucial turning point in my Mom's diabetes management! After 3 years of losing the battle on officially recommended diet (her sugar steadily climbed up into 190-200 counts), we turned to Dr. Atkins' diet and stumbled on Dr. Bernsteins' book. The Diabetes Solution addresses every detail of diabetes management, enabling one to understand the mechanism of the disease and to master the techniques of lowering and leveling blood sugar. Dr. Bernsteins' web site is also a guide to other low carbohydrate diets - thus, it has led my Mom to glycemic index literature through which she now enriches her low-carb, high-protein diet with carbohydrates that do not increase her sugar level that much. My Mom is now able to control her sugar at the level of 120 - 130 counts and is hoping to achieve even more. Thank you, Dr. Bernstein!"
5,Unconventional but brilliant approach - saved my life,"While his approach is unconventional, so is life with diabetes. Because I found out at a young age and now use this method to control my blood sugar, I'm excited that I may never require medication. My doctor recommended this book among others and advised me that living this way would be hard work. It is, but also completely worth it. BTW, once you are in the habit, it's not very hard anymore. I eat more lean (low fat) than the regimen requires, but the control of carbs has obviously controlled my blood sugar, cholesterol, and weight.If your diabetic or love someone who is, you should read as much as you can and put this book at the top of the list."
5,Makes more sense than anything I've read.,"Dr. Bernstein's approach to controlling blood sugar levels is absolutely right on the mark and is based on good common sense. All one has to do is recall Science Biology 101 to know Carbs are a NO and proteins are a DEFINITE to control blood sugar levels in the diabetic! Using Dr. Bernstein's approach, my blood sugar level stays in the range of 91 and 97 mg/dL. I feel great, and the Neuropathy in my feet has been reversed.This book is a MUST for all diabetics!"
2,Forget about this product if you need red-eye reduction!,"I bought this product mainly for removing red eyes from my digital pictures, and it does not even work! I tried and tried, and nothing happens when I try to correct my pictures, which are in the standard .jpg format. They stay exactly the same, and I had some pictures with very bright red eyes. When I do it with their sample images, though, it works, so I don't know what's wrong. Later I got two other red-eye removing softwares, which worked great. Other than that, this software has a good lighting correction tool when your pictures are too dark, too bright, etc."
2,A big disappointment,"The first chapter, a roaring historical account of a storm at sea and a soon-to-be-lost treasure, almost seems to be tacked on as an apologetic for this slow-moving sea tale. The excitement starts late as we read chapter after chapter about sailing lessons and grandma admonishing Tony to be safe. Now, we're all for stories about Portuguese grandmothers, but this is supposed to be an adventure! Once the action starts, more disappointment. We want our protagonists to drive the story forward with ingenuity and bravery. Tony, however, is more of a screw-up who does incredibly stupid things and stumbles across plot points by accident. For a more satisfying sailboat story, tryThe Lion's Paw, an old favorite that still engages today's nine year olds."
5,Great book. Innovative and still readable.,This is more than one book's worth of information. Years of research and innovation are woven together tightly and the result is an extremely informative book that is also a page turner.The book includes enough technical detail to be of use to current experts in the field and the writing makes the data accessible to the newbie as well.This would be a particularly good read for anyone in business who's looking to improve the bottom line while simultanteously lessoning the negative impact of operations on the planet. The authors show clearly how businesses can reduce costs by implementing eco-friendly practices.
3,A Good Starter Book,"Although this book definitely sees multiplicity as a disorder, it has two advantages to it. First, it covers the entire dissociative spectrum, starting with the mind of the average singleton and moving up to that of a multiple, so even people that are mid-continuum may find something of use in this book. Secondly, it explains things very simply, so even a someone new to the concept of multiplicity should be able to understand it. That said, it's damn short. Not a lot to chew on here, but enough to get you started."
5,How did this one not get airplay?,Heard this the other day of course years after its initial release. Was it music maturity or an aging process that had my ears in musical ecstasy? From start to finish this album simply ROCKS!Lead singer has a great voice! One would be hard pressed to select a bad song from this classic. If you love rock music then you must own this one. I feel guilty that I enjoy it so much and never contributed to helping the band out when this one came out.
3,Disappointing,"Great idea but rips towels. Doesn't come with the 100 towels as stated in the description. Amazon did nothing about fulfilling the order (I paid for shelf which included towels). Healthy shelf did nothing about sending the promised towels. FALSE ADVERTISING. Buyer Beware. Amazon, Target, nor Healthy Shelf returned my emails. Nobody stands behind this product. You are on your own if it is shipped and doesn't include the advertised features."
3,Plastic shelf,"On the positive, this product is a step up from the Scott paper towel holder I had been using. On the negative, the plastic seems to be flimsy. The construction is very basic (no frills). However, if you adorn the shelf with something decorative (e.g. a small planter or candle holder), it improves the appearance."
3,"not the complete ""Selva""","This isn't actually the complete set of the ""Selva morale e spirituale"", an adventurous and extensive collection of sacred music which Claudio Monteverdi completed in 1641, only 2 years prior to his death.In this CD by the ensemble Les Arts Florissants you will find only highlights. May I recommend, for your complete listening pleasure, the version recorded by Cantus Cölln (directed by mister Konrad Junghanel) on the Harmonia Mundi label. It is a 3-CD Box Set and yes, it is more expensive. But once you're touched by the ""Selva"", why not go deep into it?"
4,Good introduction for those who know only Monteverdi opera,This is the first Monteverdi work other than opera that I've heard. It is good to hear some of the other work that he needed to produce to live.
3,"A great cold war thriller, but not much else.","This is book is excellant for a US vs. Russia cold war spy novel. If you long for the mid eighties, when a nuclear strike was seconds away and it is obvious who is good and who is not, this is your book. If you expect anything more, anything, then your making a big mistake"
4,A letter from ex-USSR,"Hi,Usually I do dislike what Americans write and film about us Russians. Oh, please cut this 'Kalinka', bearded generals(they don't have beards in army!), bears on streets and so on bullsh*t. But thanks to DeMille, he depicted USSR mostly correctly. The plot itself is very interesting. How irrealistic it is? Mostly, but I've just seen an interesting story of such a kind on our TV. It tells about American named Hamilton who was considered by his family as MIA. But really he was an agent working for KGB in 60s. Later he escaped to USSR where he completly went mad. So they showed a really thrilling picture: a mad old man living in a rural Russian house for mind disabled persons, who doesn't speak any Russian and who is believing all his relatives killed by CIA. He refuses to talk to any Americans, thinking they come to assasin him. So, DeMille's story turns out not to be such irrealistic."
3,A good cold war thriller without transcending the Genra,"This is book is excellant for a US vs. Russia cold war spy novel. If you long for the mid eighties, when a nuclear strike was seconds away and it is obvious who is good and who is not, this is your book. If you expect anything more, anything, then your making a big mistake"
4,my fave spy novel,"I've read The Charm School twice. It may not start out action-packed, but once it starts, i couldn't put it down."
5,One of My Favorites!,"Great book - well worth reading and re-reading. You hit the ground running on page one and never stop. Even with all of the political changes since the book was written, it's a keeper - masterful, suspenseful, full of style and intellect."
5,This is a tell-a-friend book.,"I read a lot of books...and trade only good books with several friends. This story entices you while you read and stays with you. The premise is so good and told with such depth that this book just stands far above anything I've read recently. You will definitely want to share DeMille's work with friends! Plum Island, Gold Coast and Spencerville are all wonderful books as well."
3,Borrrrrrriiing........,"This one could have been a good 300 page story, instead its a 600+ page book. Its full of unnecessary detailed description of events which has little or no connection to the plot. Being a Demille fan this one was an utter disappointment."
2,"Just another ""bad Russians"" book, not more","Fast moving book, easy to read, but... Do you really think that Russians are so stupid? All of them? Only Americans can see the truth, only Americans can save the world... Nothing unusual, actually. That self-importance getting boring sometimes. Victory against equal costs much more..."
5,Soooooo relevant for today,"This book was AMAZING! I read it in 48 hours. I probably would have finished it sooner, but I have two toddlers. Fortunately, my husband took care of them for nearly two days while I was engrossed. The idea that there are terrorist cells in the U.S., brought to light on 9/11, makes this book more scary, as it describes how someone can melt into American society undetected. The Cold War may be over, but the story presented here is every bit as scary today."
4,Nurture by Nature,"I have three distinct children, recognizing their differences is always a challenge for a parent. This well-thought out book rejoices in their differences! I have 2 pre-teens and 1 teenager--and I found their personalities here. It's fabulous and a must-read for parents! You'll feel better about your child and your parenting."
3,Typing method flawed,"I can't say this to people enough; that MBTI method typing is flawed, because of the following reasons. First, the test you take on typelogic dot com determines your internal self. Myself for example-internally I am ESTJ but in reality I am INFJ (ESTJ is my dual-the person who is the best match for my personality type). Second, as you can see from my example of testing ESTJ my internal dual-seeking self is menefesting outwardly flawing the resaults of the test thereby putting you in a pool of people you wouldn't get along with. For correct resaults, type yourself using How to Find Yourself and Your Best Match Socionics by Rod Novichkov then take the MBTI test and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about."
5,This is the tenth copy I have bought of this book!,"Why? Because I give them away and wear them out with people I care about. It is that practical. OK, I admit to being a certified instructor in the Myers Briggs and a licensed children's counselor now working as a leadership development consultant, but TRULY the insights of Type have helped me to be a better parent (my most important role)to my beloved children. Try it. Take a MBTI assessment for yourself and learn about what each aspect of your own Type means. Follow thorugh with helping you child learn about their type. You will see the bridges to cross together that lead both of you into a richer, more productive relationship with greater joy."
4,Adorable But still hurt,"Ordered it online without even trying it in the store. Perfect size. I'm size 8 normal width. So it was true to size.It's lovely and comfy. I have problems with my right toe so it isn't perfect yet but it's just my feet not the shoes. wore them for a good friend wedding and with jumping, dancing and enjoying myself for at least 5 hours for the first try, they did hurt my legs but notice what I did so again not the shoes.Worth the price as well!November 2007 update:i gave these shoes 5 months and tried to break them in but they still hurt my toes. they are my most uncomfortable shoes ever and i withdraw my recommendation. i will give the pair only 2 stars for looking so sexy on your feet."
2,This book didn't have the infomation I was looking for,"While I liked his titles for the chapters, I didn't find this book very helpful or informative. What I was looking for was solutions, how to prevent, advice, and tips on how to keep toddlers, children, and teenagers from being materialistic, spoiled, or trapped in one the ""seven deadly sins"" he was talking about in the book. I felt the author gave too many examples about how kids may have fell in the materialistic trap and the interviews he had with teenagers didn't give me any infomation on how to keep from kids from being too overindulgent."
1,"Please spend some extra dollars, this is not worth it!","I bought two of this item, one for me and another as a gift, and both the cues were warped big time. The only thing good were the cases. If you want a inexpensive cue go to a local store so you can check for quality yourself, I later went to a store locally and bought a decent cue for $25, and it is perfect.Regards."
5,it is buggy!,"The first night his mom read it to him my great grandson told her, ""This is gross!"" Since then he has requested it be read only a couple of more times. He likes it but he likes the others better. Still, a worthwhile purchase."
5,A Classic Book in great condition,"This Book is a true classic which every Steelheader should have in there collection, time proven and tested and still works today. A must have."
2,motor went out,"it stopped working before 6 months was up, ans was only used 5 or 6 times 4 more words required"
3,"Good start, falls off later","The early parts of this book, covering the reigns of Shaka andDingane, was very well-done and interesting, making a decent history.The book gets very dull later on when it turns into a military history in the 1870s section - unless one is interested in military history, I recommend they stop as soon as this shift occurs, or else they might get bored to sleep. This is not, in my opinion, the best history of the Zulus out there - the more comprehensive Shaka's Children is more recommended."
3,Fun Rock n' Roll,"As far as I know, there's nothin' wrong with playing some rock n' roll, and D Generation do just that, with a bit of punk and a hint of sleaze thrown in for good measure. They may not be the most talented musicians I've ever heard, but they play with energy and passion, and sometimes that's good enough in rock n' roll. It won't win any awards, but this is a fun record and enjoyable to listen to, which will impress on occasion, with a killer second half (""Wasted Years"" and ""Ghosts""...and especially ""Vampire Nation"").Rock on!"
2,Not enough details,"After reading this book, I was very disappointed that it lacked the details of how to actually comply with the HIPAA regulations in the real world. About half of the book is the act itself which you can download from the US Department of Health and Human Services. The other half contains the background of HIPAA, how to determine if you are a covered entity, and very general information that you can easily obtain by searching the Internet. I would not recommend this book if you are looking for specific details and examples on how to interpret the act and create your own HIPPA compliance plan."
4,All praises to Hami !!!,"Truly a descendant of royal funk! This CD is unbelievable (and sorely overlooked) Reminiscent of Toni, Tony, Tone' and Damian Dame (R.I.P) with a taste of Musiq (before there was musiq!) Could easily be re-released today and blow up without being dated."
2,Cheap Intake Hose and HORRIBLE customer service,"Spend your money elsewhere. The intake hose, which is made out of cheap vinyl, will spring leak after a couple of days. Good luck trying to find a replacement. E-mails to the manufacturer's ""customer service"" go unanswered. Don't waste your time or money. REEL PATHETIC"
1,"Please, for the love of God, do not buy any ReelSmart products!!",Can I make it any clearer? I am just glad I was able to return it for a refund through Amazon. If you go through the manufacturer you will not be happy.This is no joke!
5,LarryV review,"I never appreciated the Spenser series when it was on, but fell in love with it on the re-runs. Sadly none of the networks show any of them???? Robert Urich and sidekick Hawk make the perfect pair of tough guys with big hearts. This movie was true to the series and very enjoyable. Now if someone would put the entire series on DVD's. Just who the heck owns the rights?"
5,BEATUFIUL,This book is beautiful .. both the photographs and the quotes from the women of posed for them. I have decided to buy several to give as gifts to my favorite women friends. I am 69 and most of my friends are in their 60s and 70s. This book helps reinforce the knowledge that inner beautfy shines and just because our faces and bodies change doesn't mean that grace and beauty are gone.
3,Just Okay,I have a lot of garnishing books... always looking for new ideas. This book is limited in what garnishes it offers. There are other books that are so much better. (Gourmet Garnishing by Mickey Baskett) or (Garnishing by Dr. Oetker) These are two of the best with wonderful garnishes we can all do!
2,A Disappointment,"After using this stand for about a year, I've found three rather frustrating design flaws. First, it's impossible to tighten the wing nut that attaches the desk to the stand enough to prevent the desk from flopping back if you add much weight. Second, the desk shelf is only an inch deep, and as you add sheets of music, before long they begin tumbling to the floor. And third, the telescopic stand has a tendency to collapse under weight unless the nut is tightened as much as possible, which can make it difficult to loosen to adjust the height. Since I don't need a collapsible stand, I'm replacing it with a Manhasset M48."
1,I'm surprised it didn't come with a pin-up poster,"Perhaps some people buy a cookbook to see the author's picture on every page. Or if not his picture, then at least his name, please--I might forget the star power of the author. But alas, no such luck. Since he's even got his name embedded in the title, he can be everywhere all at once. I guess some people are impressed with hype, could use even more of it than is dished up every day in our culture. I, on the other hand, could have used some recipes that didn't involve cooking for family reunion size crowds. And I could have used some recipes that involved more than cooking everything indoors and then lugging a pot out to the grill to finish it off. A waste of time--unless you want more pictures of the title-bearer himself."
4,A Fun Book To Cook With,As a life long NY Yankee fan and constant tailgate partier I love a good BBQ. And as much as I love hotdogs and burgers sometimes you want to do something different.Bobby Flay's book as his TV Show chilling and grilling show you some easy to make great stuff to cook on the grill.There is not much that needs to be said here other than the book is easy to follow and the food is good.Check out the Tuna burgers!
2,Get something else,"As much as I like stack the deck styles, this book was a bust for me. The only quilt design I like is the one on the cover and the one with the hearts. Perhaps it is the color and fabric choices featured in the book, but I just feel like the designs are not fun or new."
5,Excellent reading,"Thank you very much for the book ""Children of Willesden Lane . . . . . . . ."" The book arrived exactly on time. I enjoyed reading this book immensely. I could barely put it down. I even loaned it to my 95 year old neighbor, she finished it in 4 days.Thank you again,Elisheva Gold"
5,"Ingmar Bergman's Magic Flute... Magic, indeed!","This is another DVD I've been looking for. There are many versions of Mozart's Magic Flute and this is the one for me. I saw it years ago, perhaps when it came out, in the theatre and it stuck with me. It's wonderful on many levels. Full of humor, passion, color, emotion and of course wonderful singing, in lovely Swedish (with optional English subtitles)."
5,Great toy,"I bought this toy based off of the reviews and could not be happier. My daughter is six months old and although she can not yet understand about putting the shapes into the container,she loves to put them in her mouth and they are durable enough and large enough where I don't have to worry about her choking. They also have beads inside them so when you shake them they make noise, and have been a wonderful ""crawling incentive"" for her when they are placed just out of her reach. The colors are vivid and I know she will like this toy even more when she gets a bit older."
5,favorite toy!,my 8 month old son loves this thing! it fascinates him to no end. i can leave him with this in the play pen and he will be busy for 45 minutes. he loves the sounds it makes when he shakes it. he's also dropped this from our kitchen table onto the wood floor several times and it's never broken. i would buy this again.
5,Rolling Shape Sorter,"This is made of durable plastic. The shapes are also very durable. Each shape makes a small noise. All together, the toy can be pretty loud, but not too bad compared to other toys. I like the fact this is not made of wood. I did not want wood.There are six different shapes and both sides of the roller have inserts for the shapes. Both ends can open easily to get the shapes out.This is a very nice toy for the young ones!"
4,Almost perfect,"My son got this for his first birthday. He loves it and spends lots of time playing with it. Its well constructed and durable. My son likes that all the shapes make noise ad enjoys banging them together and putting them in the holes.I have 2 small issues with the toy though. I wish it didn't basically have 3 flower shapes. They could have used a square,a moon or even a trapezoid to change things up but they didn't which is why I took off one star. Also I wish the holes were just a smidgen bigger. Sometimes if my son doesn't get them in perfectly straight the shapes go in the hole but get stuck half way through. I have to help and push it through for him which frustrates him.All in all its a good toy and I'm glad we have it."
5,a toy a child can grow with,"I bought this toy for my grand daughter when she was 4 months old. She loved the noise of the little shapes and bright colors and put all the pieces in her mouth! As months have passed she learned to put the shapes into the holes and roll it around. Now at 22 months she still loves this toy, she names the colors puts the shapes in the holes, carries it around. Well made, safe toy that can meet the needs as a baby grows. A big hit."
3,"Not bad, but still could have been better.","This self-titled CD, released in 1994, was Michael Sweet's first full-length solo release following his departure from Stryper. Michael Sweet has long been recognized as a great vocalist by both Christian & secular observers, and his vocals sound great on this CD. Musically this album combines elements of Bryan Adams, Bon Jovi and perhaps even a little Def Leppard. Lyrically, this CD represents a return to the upfront Christian message found on Stryper's early records. There are also a couple of ""relationship"" songs as well--""Together"" & ""Tomorrow, Tonight."" Some of the better songs here include ""Take Me Home,"" ""All This & Heaven Too,"" ""Someday"" & ""Forever Yours."" Altogether, this is not a bad CD, but I still believe it coud have been better. ""Real"" was more of what I was expecting, and I do think it's actually a better record. ""Truth"" is Michael's best solo effort to date."
5,It touches the Soul,"To be honest I love the Beats and the words. I'm a str8 hip hop fan anyways and I can truely Say I will get your album Cinque. Keep doing what you do. And Remember any things is possible threw the Eyes of ""God"". I'll keep you in my prays but once againI'm feeling the Cd"
4,Looking forward to the new one,Get Clark Smart was great in its time. But Clark has a new book coming out this summer. Can't wait to get it!
3,Good but not quite what I expected.,"Most of the more interesting fonts are in the Elegant Fonts and Fantastic fonts. Although, those fonts are shown they are not available for use in the professional fonts. I may have to end up buying the other two (Elagant and Fantastic) to get what I was really looking for."
5,Challenger 2,I am so happy to have found this resource. I use it as a reading tutor. It's an excellent series.
4,"Very good, but not quite as spectacular as I had hoped","This is a very solid biography, but I have to say that it just failed to be brilliant. I had seen it listed several places as a very good one-volume biography, but it clearly feels like a biography from an earlier, more genteel generation. There are very few probing questions about Washington as a person, and a respectful distance from the subject is maintained at all times. This is a one-volume distillation from a multi-volume work undertaken by the author. The very famous biography by Doughlas Freeman is also available in a one-volume abridgement, but that one was not done by the author, and therefore represents the editor's and not the author's belief about what is most essential in the book. So curiously, while the Freeman biography in its unabridged form may still be the definitive biography of Washington in English, this abridgement by Flexner of his longer work may be preferable as a short biography."
4,Fascinating factually; stylistically stuffy,"Washington's life was interesting almost beyond believability, and Flexner stuffs the pages of his book with mountains of well researched detail. The reader will be fascinated by everything he/she didn't learn about Washington in school. However, Flexner's writing style is dense and unnecessarily scholarly. His favorite bad habit is jamming lengthy parenthetical details into the midsections of already-lengthy sentences. This too often places a sentence's subject and its predicate a taxi ride's distance from one another, necessitating too much re-reading of sections to grasp meaning. Still, I devoured this book eagerly, which I attribute primarily to Washington's brilliant life, not to Flexner's stuffy style. I recommend sampling online pages of the book before purchasing to discern your own willingness to wade through the thicket of prose."
1,"Good features, unsatisfactory implementation","I always used Panasonic and Technics consumer electronics and considered it reliable and high quality.This system is my worst Panasonic ever. I bought it from Circuit City.Talking of features, it is nice. Powerful sound (considering size), good radio reception, ability to play mp3 disks, nice remote.The problems began 2 days after expiration of 30-day return period. Right speaker stopped playing and was producing loud noise instead. Since it was too late to return the unit to the store, I had to take it to the warranty repair shop, where they fixed it in 8 days.Unfortunatly 2 weeks later the same problem returned and I had to take it to the same shop again. No surprise that 2 days after this second repair it broke for the 3rd time. Very frustrating experience.I am starting the negotiations with Panasonic and will try to get my money back"
1,POOR SERVICE AND QUALITY,"THIS ARRIVED BROKEN AND WHEN I SENT IT BACK AND ASKED ""NOT"" TO BE SENT ANOTHER ONE THEY SENT IT ANYWAY...I NOW HAVE TO RETURN ANOTHER ONE OF WHAT I DON'T WANT"
4,You'll howl till you pee your pants,"I read this book, and I hollered, I rolled, I laughed my ass off. He's not only funny, but he makes a lot of great points, and he speaks the truth just as often. I reccommend everyone to read this book. It will keep you sane when all else fails."
5,George Carlin - The Master of Comedy,"Let me just say that this book came at a great time when I needed something to read late at night and make me laugh out loud until I woke the annoying neighbors up next door. George, you are the master of comedy and I admire you and your brilliant writting. You are a pleasure to read, and hear! Truly one of the funniest and most inspiring comics today. What is so amazing about this book is that it is not only funny, many of Georges ideas....make sense! Believe it or not....I found myself agreeing with him many times. Thank you for the laughs George. For you I have nothing but praise!!!"
5,THE LAUGHING CYNIC,"When I first started listening to George Carlin a few years ago, I reacted with mixed feelings. I laughed until weeping at his hilarious observations, but often cringed when he'd say something like 'I want to see people in the streets killing policmen.' His manic nihilism often scared the cheese out of me. However, as I patronized his comedy more and more, I learned to just relax and go with his maniacal flow. That is the way to read BRAIN DROPPINGS; with an open mind and a desire for belly laughs. I may be speaking from a less-than-impartial point of view here since my own worldview is a few shades darker than the Roman catacombs, but I still think that Carlin's brand of hilarity is humor at it's most visceral, boundless and prickly best."
4,Recommended,"i recommend this book, it is entertaining and easy to read (and of course, very funny). but i think Napalm & Silly Putty was probably funnier. it's only one cent (used), so you might as well buy it."
4,Good Read,"A mighty fine read. The first Carlin book I've read, having been introduced to him via the joys of VHS video. He's not well-known in Australia, but he should be. I am now hanging out to complete the Carlin Collection..."
3,Not overly funny,"After reading Napalm & Silly Putty, I figured that this book would be pretty much the same. I didn't find this book funny at all. Veteran standup comic, George Carlin takes his own shot at authorship. Unlike many comics who focus on a limited range of subjects, Carlin has a versatile talent and his book covers everything from pitiful puns to classically structured jokes. He is less successful when he examines things he deeply cares about, like politics and justice. His anger is too close to the surface. Many of his jokes are taken straight from his stage act and they suffer by being reduced to printed page. I do recommend his other book, Napalm & Silly Putty."
1,what happened?,"I used to love George Carlin, but this book?! What a disappointment. I could forgive the mostlyweak humor if it weren't backed with such bitterness and bile! It reads more like the rantings of a sour Ebenezer Scrooge, than the insightful observations of a keen satirist. My advice? Buy one of Carlin's old albums instead. Now those are funny!"
4,George Carlin Brain Droppings,Book arrived on time. Good comedy for anyone OVER the age of 21. If you know Carlin you know what I mean.
4,Brain Droppings,"This is the first book I read by Carlin. I've seen many of his shows and found the book to be more of the same carlin-comedy. Stories, rants, jokes, one-liners... they are all there. The book is a great mix of it all. I can recommend it to all who like George and the comedy he brings.Before reading the book, I would recommend seeing at least 2 of his shows. That way you have an idea of what he does and how he delivers his jokes."
1,Not remotely funny,I have to admit that I didn't read the entire book. I probably read about 1% of it but that is all I could stomach. I picked up the book because I had run across quotes from George Carlin on the Internet and thought they were very funny. I put the book down not because of the type of humor or the vulgarity -- I enjoy both in a good comedian. The problem with the book is that it simply is not funny. It's boring. It's so boring it hurts.
1,There's no fool like an old fool,"What exactly does an old millionaire have to whine about? This book, which I acquired for nothing, unfunnily tries to answer this timeless question. Occasional clever Carlin quips are offset by pages of venemous, unfunny rants. One good grouch deserves another: ""The covers of this book are too far apart."" --Ambrose Bierce"
1,Not sturdy. Invest your money elsewhere.,"The rakes bent after a couple of uses, then they fell off after a couple more uses, making the product completely useless. Also, I found it to be small. Definitely not a sturdy product. I would invest my money elsewhere."
2,Teeth bend very easily in grass,"The handle, fulcrum, and scoop body are all fine. However, the teeth bend very easily, leaving a gap between the scoops, which makes picking up poop a challenge. Yes, you can bend them back into place, but not the most appealing thing to do when they are covered in dog poo."
2,crappy pooper scooper,It's very rickety and hard to maneuver. The tongs bend easily. We ended up separating the arms and using them as a shovel set. We will be finding a new scooper soon.
1,Not durable at all,The prongs on the rake bent back in the first use. I have not used it since. I am pretty disappointed.
1,ouch... part two,"I know, I should have waited... when I wrote the first review... but now, I must add that this video titled Cruising Guide to St. Thomas and St. John... spends too much time on the BVI... which I had thought would have been the subject of the Cruising Guide to the BVI... and since when does horse racing in the BVI, a large segment... be a guide to the USVI..?I am disappointed"
5,Adventurous Fun,"Most travel and relocation guides aren't read past the first chapter because they're so freakin' boring. This one is not, because it tells stories while it educates. If you're moving to Barcelona for a year or forever, pick this one up. Paa-Kerner enthuses in the fun to be had, and also shares her insights into the wonderful mix of cultures that will inevitably shape your experience as you soak into the great city of Barcelona."
1,Visit Catalonia and see the truth,"If you want to smile with the abilities of ""guiri"" at grocery's and her superb vision of Catalan culture, this is your book. But if you want to learn about my city, please refer to any serious guide around there, just recall the '92 Olympic Games or see citizens of Barcelona on TV ""fighting"" against war."
4,A Great Price for the Product,I currently own a covered hose reel that was double the cost. This reel works fine and seems to reel in quicker than the older model. I have 125 feet of hose on the reel. My only concern is that there is no guide for the incoming hose to keep it even on the reel. Regardless it was a great buy for the money. I would recommend this model to all.
5,Great Read!,"This was the first James Patterson book I've read and since I finished it (in less than 3 days time)I've been hooked. I've read all the women's club murder mysteries, The Honeymoon and now I'm starting on the Alex Cross series.The Beach House is a great read. I thought I wouldn't like the short chapters, but as great as this book was I didn't even realize the chapters were over before I'd turn the page. I love the characters, the story, it's something that anyone would love to see done if it happened to their brother. Now you have to read it to understand. You won't be disappointed!"
3,take it to the beach,"In Patterson's latest book he once again comes forth with another page turner. Taking a turn away from his usual psychological thrillers, Patterson delves into a world of money,greed,seduction and lies. In the beginning, Patterson pulls you head first into the story of a young law student desperate to find out the truth behind his troubled brother's death at the Hamptons. Unlike his other books where he keeps you hanging onto his every word, Patterson lossens his hold throughout the middle of the story. Of course in the end he comes back with a conclusion that has a suprising little twist. ""Beach House"" is a good summer beach read, but I'll take a roller coaster Dr Alex Cross novel any day."
2,Lame,I agree that this book is a total soap opera. There is very little character development and you just really don't care about the characters. It does feel like a contractual obligation. Better luck next time Patterson!
1,Never Again,"This book was on the best sellers list for a while on cnn.com, so decided to buy it once out in paperback....Big Mistake!!!! I read it about half way and just couldn't take it anymore. It took me about a mth to get that far. It normally takes me less than a week to read a book that size if it is captivating enough. I usually try to force myself to finish a book even if it turns out not to be too interesting, but I just couldn't do so this time. There was really nothing in it to captivate me and keep more coming back for more. I eventually had to just give up and move to more interesting book. In the process, I discovered Harlan Coben. The one book of his I've read was really good and I plan on reading the others. The book is ""No Second Chance"" by Harlan Coben."
2,Did I miss Something? __ Dumb Book,"I really did not enjoy this book. Was a nice, quick read and had some humor....but at the end I felt like i wasted the few hours it took to read.Really just kind of a twisted, ""fixer-upper"" book that short changed itself with an unbelievable solution.Read it, but dont buy it"
2,The Beach Dud,I recently finished reading The Beach House. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I started reading it after having finished a lengthy and complicated novel. This book was exactly the opposite. It was as if the author was spoonfeeding his audience the plot. The too short chapters read like some screenplay. I won't blow the ending for you but c'mon! The characters were either all good or all bad. There was so empathy created for anyone and the people were flat and underdeveloped. Maybe this was a good book for those who didn't want to think about anything when they read it. Maybe it'll make a good movie.
2,Trashy Summer read,This is one of the emptiest books written by Patterson. It has glaring holes that leave the reader frustrated. This is a cheap attempt to capitalize on people's interest in how the rich live and reassure them that they wouldn't want to be rich. Save your money unless you want a quick read that leaves you empty.
3,Classic Legal tale of David and Goliath.....,"This is a classic tale of David and Goliath. In this novel the ""little guy"" is the brother of a young man found dead on the beach after a huge party at a millionaires beach house. Many signs point to murder as the cause of death, but strange things begin to happen, autopsies change, testimony changes, people disappear and the motives for murder appear unclear. What could a handsome young man have done to warrant such a brutal attack? Who is involved in making the whole case vanish and how deep does the conspiracy go? Who is actually responsible for this savage murder? How can a working class family fight against a politically connected, wealthy family and see justice properly served? This novel if full of twists and turns that will hold your attention through to the ending. The ending may seem obvious to some readers, but the manner in which it is reached will definitely surprise you."
4,I liked this one,"This is the first James Patterson book I have listened to, but I really enjoyed it. I took it to the beach and for three days that is what I did. Sat at the beach and listened. I thought it moved fast and was a very good story. Even though some of it was predictible, it was a nice way to spend my vacation. I would recommend it."
1,Don't bother with this one,"This is the first Patterson novel I have read, and I guess I shouldn't have started with The Beach House. The story was basically unbelieveable and it read like a hurried made-for-TV movie along with the very short chapters and the simplistic plot. But maybe that is what he was after when he was writing it. The story starts off with a murder and our ""hero"" is off and running - trying to find out who would kill his brother. Along the way, he finds all kinds of terrible stuff about his sibling and fights with all the big wigs in the world. Wait for the paperback."
1,Hopelessly Bad...............,"Once again, after the poor 2nd chance, Patterson did another poor fiction again!! sorry for using so many 'agains', because this Beach House is really bad! Perhaps Patterson is writing too much for the past years, then the quality of works are diminishing enormously.Anyway, i think i will not buy anymore...."
2,What was the motive?,"The book wasn't all bad, in fact it was enjoyable and easy to read, however the plot was incomplete. What was the killer's motive? It was not totally clear... A bit of a disappointment for Patterson as he usually excels in this sort of plot, just not this time."
1,Beach Depression!!!,"I thought this was going to be a slick, stylish and suspensefulbook when I saw the cover and Mr. Patterson's name on the top. But instead of an enjoyable read I was submerged into some kind of sick and perverse world. The characters were unlikable and the dialogue was inane. Mr. Patterson must have had a high fever and was delirious when he wrote this. I've enjoyed his previous books but Beach House was a downer. Maybe a tidal wave will take the house out to sea. My greatest fear is that this becomes a series..."
3,A side trip from the usual,"I am an avid Patterson reader and have read all. I enjoy mostly the Cross series, but really did enjoy Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. Beach House is another venture off the Cross series and unfortunately, although I did enjoy it, just not as much as some other novels. I must admit that I did have several instances where time would pass between readings, but I still found it difficult at times to keep up the story line. I found myself going back to re-read sections to remember the names of the charactors and who was who more than usual.As I said, this is a good Patterson book, no question, just not his usual level of excitement."
3,Just OK,"The good -- This is a real page turner. I made the mistake of starting it before going to bed on a night when I had to work the next day. (oops!) It is a fast and quick read, rather like watching an action film.The bad -- It is like watching an action film. The plot is a bit thin and asks us to accept a few things that just aren't quite believable. There is very little character development. The motivations of the characters are very simplistic.Overall -- Just OK. I'd buy it in paperback or borrow it. It wasn't worthy of the hardcover price. If you are in the market for quick entertainment, then it is great. If you want a book with a little more complexity and sublety, this one strikes out."
1,A PAGE TURNER BUT...,"I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book."
1,A big disappointment,"I bought this book looking for a fun, fast-paced read - instead, I found myself struggling to finish it. The plot veers between the ludicrous and the utterly predictable; the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical. The denouement is silly and mawkish. Overall, a waste of time and money."
2,Save time and money!!!,"True is this is the first book I read from Paterson. I finished it because I have discipline. What a joke the book is. Very square characters with no shades. Common grounds and with a very poor facts based proposal. There were moments where I was asking myself why I continued with this nosense ""mystery"".I guess it was not the right one to start a Patterson library."
3,Keeps you reading,"This is an enjoyable book. This is hardly a ground breaking read...yet it keeps you engaged. You feel a connection to the main character Jack and empathize with his scituation. Only to imagine what you would want to do with the same injustices. Macklin is a loveable character that you relate to immediately. As the story unfolds it is taken to the extremes almost unbelievable. Yet the reader is still pulling for Jack & Macklin, the average American vs. the extremely wealthy. Hoping for justice. All in all Patterson gives us a satisfying story, not much different from his other easy, short chaptered reads."
3,Beach House - Rent It!,"I took the audio by Guy Bellows along on a business trip. Very nice voice! But the story -----because it was JP, I listened to it all and it was OK. As a former Long Islander I had a lot of trouble when the main character described the Hamptons, Long Island RR and Ronkonkoma with the accent on the 'koma'. Did I pronounce it incorrectly all those years with the accent on the 'kon'? That kind of 'undid' it for me because I tried so hard to like this book and believe it's strangeness.JP writes the shortest chapters in history and ends up with a book of about 115 of them. Ya gotta love the guy! He makes you want to read ""one more chapter."""
2,Kills a few hours ...,"I found the book to be a fast read and the short chapters and rapid descriptions flowed easily enough.I particularly enjoyed the class struggles represented by the characters'conflict underneath the main plot.That having been said, the characters were all a bit shallow and the twists of the story were a bit obvious. I found the last dozen chapters or so to be completely without credibility. The prospect that a ""pirate television signal"" could operate over a few days without the police and military resources of this nation having any clue from where it was originating ... preposterous.Though the author appears to seek to leave the reader with a sense of righteous catharsis, book left me with a sick feeling at the INJUSTICE perpetrated by the protagonists. The mockery of forcing someone to endure an illegal legal proceeding (itself a literal contradiction)did not bring satisfaction."
3,"Good, but has a Hollywood ending","I enjoyed the first half of the book, but the story soon became predictable. I recommend it as a light, non-challenging, summer read."
1,Just Awful,"I do not believe for a moment that James Patterson had anything to do with the writing of this novel.If by chance I'm wrong,........please, please, Mr. Patterson, stick to writing of Detective Alex Cross.I found ""The Beach House"" quite infantile and was highly disappointed."
1,Dull and unrealistic,"This was a real disappointment. The situations are contrived, the characters are unrealistic and either cloyingly good and well-intentioned or unremittingly evil. The plot is pedestrian. Not even good beach read."
3,Very Predictable,"I found this very good, however within the 2nd chapter, any ideas on ""Who dunnit"" and ""Who will end up marrying whom"" were too obvious."
2,Patterson is delusional.,"I read on Patterson's website before this book was published that he was excited about the Beach House because of the exciting, groundbreaking courtroom action at the end. Trust me, nothing was exciting or groundbreaking about it. A good courtroom drama has quality characters and twists and turns. The only thing changing here is the setting. If Patterson would focus on writing good characters, the twists will come. I can't say I reccommend this book unless you have a few days to spare and 20 bucks to blow."
1,Juvenile writing and plot,"... effort by best-selling author, something I might expect from a teen-aged writer -- plot is ridiculous, dialogue is a joke. An easy and fast read, but hardly worth the time. How often do you read almost 200 pages and then decide it is not worth another minute of your time?"
4,The Beach House By: James Patterson,"Peter Mullen was a valet at the most exclusive East Hampton party. During a break, he was advised to go to the beach by an anonymous perfumed note. He thought he'd get lucky. Instead, he lost his life.When his body washed up on the beach, the authorities called it suicide. Jack Mullen (Peter's brother) knew it wasn't true. His brother would never go swimming in a stormy tide, much less kill himself during a work break. Mullen's family and other Montauk ""townie"" friends demand and investigation. However, the authorities are less than cooperative, preferring to protect Barry Neubauer, the wealthy CEO who hosted the party that fateful evening.Jack risks his future law career to find answers regarding Peter's death, but his inexperience is no match for Neubauer's counsel. When Jack's friends are threatened, the covered-up murder is confirmed."
1,VERY Disappointed,"I've really enjoyed James Patterson's other books, esp. the Alex Cross series, so I was looking forward to cracking this one open. I am so disappointed. I made myself finish the book, even though I really didn't care what happened to the characters. The book is VERY choppy, the plot is a bit ridiculous, and the ending is... well, I expected better of Mr. Patterson. Maybe because it's jointly written it's not quite as good as his regular stuff. Hoping that the next one I read meets my expectations."
2,Blah,"This one was truly a disappointment. Patterson & his co-author started out well enough and continued just fine until about halfway through. Then, it's as if the deadline was looming and he just had to come up with something to finish it up. It was just a little too ""out there"" for me. Just started ""Judge and Jury"". Hope this one is better!"
2,Didn't like it,"I didn't like this book at all, for reasons I can't give without spoiling the book for everyone. If you like Patterson, you might like it. I don't really care for Patterson. Even after reading ""Sam's Letters to Jennifer,"" which was a good story, I just don't care for his style. He writes very simply, with not a lot of character description and I feel unattached and not a part of the story. I get lost easily and find myself skipping paragraphs and not even missing them.I think this was my last Patterson read...I've had enough.Read it if you like but you may be disappointed. The rating should say that.."
2,Boring,"Peter was killed off to soon ,and most of book talks about his death aand his brother trying to find his killer . Book is boring to me and at halfway through the book I am ready to toss it . This is not one of Pattersons best but of course I had already read Lake House before reading this one ."
4,first patterson - loved it!,"I have to disagree w/ some of the other reviews. I loved that each chapter was only 2-3 pages long. I have 2 kids and am a stay at home mom so shorter chapters makes it easier to steal away and read a little at a time and next time you pick up the book you don't have to search through a page in the middle of a chapter to see where you left off. Patterson has come highly recommended from friends and family and after reading this book, he did not disappoint. I am starting 1st degree now and can't wait to get my hands on when the wind blows b/c the lake house is sitting on my nightstand waiting for me too!"
2,Midly entertaining,"Patterson's book The Beach House is a mildly entertaining read, which just about managed to hold my attention throughout. The characters are convincing and at first its interesting though I thought the ending was a big letdown which didn't do justice to Part One - it was highly inplausible. I only stumbled across it by accident - It sufficed as a timefiller but I wouldn't advise towards buying this book.Daniel O'Carroll (14)Cork, Ireland."
1,Beach House Comic Book,"The best part of this story it its plot. That's being charitable since the fate of The Fixer is anticlimactic and nearly irrelevant to the story's conclusion. The last half of the story, while it has plenty of action, is right out of a Marvel comic book.I must conclude that this book was written on contract and the last part was done in a hurry to make a deadline. Patterson is a better author than this.All this said, the book isn't totally useless. It can serve as a bad literary example in nearly every aspect of modern storytelling."
2,Good airplane book,"I just read this book on an overseas flight from Germany and it was a perfect read for my trip. Rather mindless, but it kept me from boredom while buckled in my seat."
5,Return to the Valley of the Go-Go's,If you are a fan of the Go-Go's then this CD set is for you! I have really enjoyed it.
3,watered down pop slop is the problem,"With U.S. Bombs, you pretty much know what you're getting.On this record, the group is able to compose cuts containing more memorable melodies. The addition of Curt Stitch on 2nd guitar may prove why. The bridge hooks are this record's strongest points. The more polished production doesn't take away from what the band always aims to do; create an honest, energetic, and angry punk record with no pretenses.However, I've quickly noted that these memorable bridge hooks are repeated throughout a number of songs. Other than this, I enjoyed it!As a long time punk lover, I more partial to Die Hunns because of the dual vox between Peters and his wife, Corey Parks. The overall rock n' roll vibe is more for me! ;)"
4,Good overall,"Comfortable and roomy, the seat was relatively easy to install, especially with the LATCH system. The design seems better suited to forward-facing configuration, though. There is no leveling indicator like other seats.The ""crotch buckle"" seems a bit snug already, so we're not sure what we'll do when our daughter gets even bigger, but the shoulder straps seem to offer plenty of room to grow. We also really like the cup and snack holders, these are definitely important as baby gets older and more active."
5,A Tree grows in Brooklyn,"It is a story about a poor Family struggling and living in Brooklyn. I t is thoroughly enjoyable and the performances of all the actors deserved to each get an ""Oscar""."
4,Excellent moive,my wife and I watched this movie and we enjoyed it a great deal. It captures the depression and a time when people tried to make do with very little money.
5,They don't make 'em like this any more,"A poor Irish family in Olde New Yorke. It's a life-affirming period piece like 'It's a Wonderful Life', but without the pretension or the longeurs. It manages to keep on the right side of sentimentality 99% of the time, and the music is integrated perfectly, like they used to know how to do in those days. Not a twee weepie, but a sweet, well-realised family drama."
3,No hot seat mutiplayer!,"The game has great graphics and sound, but too many bugs that can't be corrected by patches. And no hot seat multiplayer, it REALLY needs that option. Another thing that bugs me (ha ha) is that in the battle maker you can't change the placement of victory locations. Also it can be disappointing to not be able to play your 3 player game except on the internet. Still PGIII is a big improvement over Panzer General 2 in that in PGII the only way to win is to take over all the victory locations or destroy all the enemy's units. In PGIII there are 4 ways to win, which really adds to the flavor of the game."
4,jah volt herr general!,"This was my first PG video game, but about my eigth that I have been searching for to quell my desire to be a general and use my brains to do something similar to what they did in WW2. PG does that! I find it fairly accurate and a lot of fun. What could have been done to make it more challenging, fun and realistic would be to take into account supply and logistics. Guderion, nor Karhkov, could just click a mouse and wait a turn to be completely refitted! Maybe the next PG, PG4, they will! docv"
5,An interesting rhythm captivates children 2 to 5 years.,"A simple tale of two trains racing from Kalamazoo to Timbuctu.Ms. Brown has a way with rhythm. Her stories build a tempo with the words, as do other childrens books, but then she breaks it. This captures the attention of young children as no other author has done. Her best known work is Good Night Moon. Yes, they sound like the usual bland works for youngsters, but watch the eyes of a four-year-old as you read it. It's magic!"
1,Yuppie Crap,"I've picked stuff outta my nose after a long ride which contained more character and advice than this claptrap.1 star because ""No Stars"" was not an option ..."
1,Worth the cent,"Just before writing this review, I noticed that there were over 100 new/used copies available from sellers starting at $.01 (thats a penny for the bikers that failed math). Even at that price it isn't worth it. Here is a quick summary of Biker Code:Look like everyone elseRide the same bike as everyone elseTalk like everyone elseTravel in a pack (with everyone else)Then call yourself an individual. What a load of crap."
4,nightlight plug,"was very easy to install, and bright enough for a child room. received the item very quickly. will be ordering more"
1,Where's the Documentation??,"When an author on a medical topic purports to offer a miracle, my antennae immediately extend. This theory reminds me of similar stuff that was popular back around the US Civil War, nearly 150 years ago and long discredited. Where is the documentation? Upon what science is this material based? We don't know, because the good doctor didn't tell us. Either we should infer that since this book is aimed at a popular audience he considers footnotes inappropriate; or, perhaps there just isn't any hard science backing this up at all?"
1,Don't buy....don't follow Young's advice,The authors of this book have no formal training in medicine or science - 'Dr' Young got his degrees from a certification/correspondence mill.The premise laid out in this book is sheer quackery that has no basis in reality. Get your advice elsewhere.
2,Useful but flawed.,"I have felt some of the benefits of adopting the Young diet - but I do not believe that these results can be ascribed to the causes postulated by his theory. The theory that alkaline means energy (and that acid means energy deficit) is simplistic and is unsupported by credible evidence. I do not believe in the efficacy of Robert Young's patent medicines. I have found that sodium bicarbonate has equally beneficial 'alkalising' effects - at a fraction of the cost. Fundamentally, Robert Young is advocating nothing more than a routine healthy diet. But he tries to disguise this fact with pseudo-scientific jargon, unsupported assertions, a paucity of real evidence and an array of unnecessarily expensive commercial products of doubtful efficacy. Nevertheless, the type of diet which he recommends may well produce some beneficial effects."
1,The pH Miracle,This book is vegitarian propaganda. Mix a little truth (acid vs alkaline) add vegii tales and you get new age nutrition fiction.
2,Might read other perspectives,Based on our family experience a plan like this helped to cleanse us and make us feel better SHORT TERM(6 mos) but over a number of years following this protocol lead to demineralization ( now if one ate enough fats...maybe 5-7 avocadoes per day like the author seems to possibly do( have fun with that!!). Even so It would be very wise to read other authors with huge amounts of success but very different protocols....our family is very health conscious and I regret having implemented this protocol long term.It may be wise to read on this topic by authors such as these with VERY DIFFERENT opinions as many of the same topics are addressed and very different conclusions are attained:Joseph MercolaDr. Weston A PriceMark SissonNatasha Campbell-McBrideDonna GatesJust to name a few who address this issue with great success from a VERY different angle.
1,Superstitious Junk!,"I started looking into Ph/Alkaline diets after reading some research on how Ph imbalances in Scientific American (a source I deem credible).A friend bought me this book to encourage my interest. However, after scanning the first 4 chapters or so it became clear what this book is...The author talks about ""studies"" he organized where athletes on the Ph ""Miracle"" diet who wore special ""EMF protecting Amulets"" performed better than those not on the diet. AMULETS!!! OK!!The author's diet advice is based upon his claim that Louis Pasteur's germ theory is wrong and instead germs spontaneously appear based on what we eat - WOW!This book is a joke, based on junk science, superstitious belief (AMULETS!) and is a waste of time. It has me seriously questioning the intelligence of my friend who recommended it."
5,A very fine album.,"""Wilder"" ranks up there with the best of Julian Cope's solo albums (Peggy Suicide, Jehovahkill, and World Shut Your Mouth). The songs are often slow and moody on ""Wilder"", which probably intentionally contradicts the album's title. The songs grew on me more than any other album I own. Not many people have heard this album, which is a real shame."
2,poor qualitty,"picks up poop with lots of effort. It smears and breaks the poo, so you have to take care to really get under it and shake it as you pull up from the grass. Smears all over the grass and our grass dies in those pots. Kids can't play there even after pickup b/c so much residue is left. I left it outside and it broke - came unhinged. Poor product."
1,scooper is a pooper !,"The third day I used the scooper and the teeth broke off,making retrieving poop a rotten scoop. All that money for this cheaply made failure a ripoff. The plastic used in this dud , was/ is a low grade plastic that is very brittle and and weak when exerting closing pressure on the handle.The item is held together with cheaply made plastic washers, I rate this failure as poor,poor,poor."
1,Decent Effort,"CD is alright, innovative use of outside instruments, but the vocals need some severe resuscitation."
1,*sigh*,"I'd rather listen to Limp D*ck than this audio suicide! Mixing emo with techno and pop? It's the equivalent of mixing gas with strike-anywhere matches; bad things happen to those unprepared. I do not see how anyone could ever bare even a minute of this, let alone a whole album of it! You might as well listen to a man sodomize himself with a rusty spoon while horrible techno is going on in the background. There isnt much diffrence.Recommended for 14 year old shallow minded girls, people with little or no soul,and those with really, really, really bad taste in music."
1,Start panicking,"This band sucks. My roommate will not stop playing this album. All of the songs sound exactly the same, but have completely unnecessary and random bridges. The canned techno in the middle of track two almost made me barf. The lyrics make no sense at all. Awful awful album."
5,Love it!,"Great album. Songs are somewhat similar in style, but the musical quality of the album is great. The songs are catchy, interesting to listen to (some tell stories), that use a wide variety of instruments and synthesizers. Great stuff."
4,Intriguing,"This is a very intriguing listen. You don't know whether you should drop everything and dance or else just kind of sit there and listen. Very cool synth, cool songs, just an overall pretty cool album. Would've given it five stars but the lead singer sounds a little too much like Fall Out Boy, not that that's a bad thing...just kind of makes it harder for P!ATD to be taken seriously. Spend your money though, you won't be disappointed in your investment."
2,So Sad,"I thought this was gonna be a great album. The song ""I write sins not tragedies"" is simply amazing. But don't be fooled, the rest of the album pretty much sucks. If you heard ""I write sins not tragedies"" on the radio and loved it, like i did, do your self a favor and just buy the single."
1,what happened to the good music!,"This band really sucks, after hearing fall out boy i was like man can music get any worse, then panic came out and now i just dont know what to do. if i could give this negative stars i would, what has happened to the good music, like the smashing pumpkins, nirvana, pearl jam, led zeppelin, weezer, pink floyd, rush, the list goes on. This is a really bad album, i listened to it once and i sold it right away, so dont make the same mistake i did and go buy it, listen to real music. i know i sound harsh to all you panic fans out there but seriously, come on!!! panic at the disco, what is that??"
4,Awesome!,"This was awesome. My favorite songs were It's Time To Dance, Camisado, But It's Better If You Do, Build God Then We'll Talk, but my number one favorite song was I Constantly Thank God...This was a great album!"
2,FOB rip off much???,I enjoyed about 4 songs on this album...the rest sounds IDENTICAL to fall out boy. When i put the album in my stero I could have SWORN I was listening to FOB. I must admit a few of their songs that are very original I do enjoy. After looking at the book though The lead singer and the Lead Guitar man have so many other instruments under their belt I can see this band being so much BIGGER and BETTER if they run as far away as possible from Peter Wentz. Too much talent to be run by a man who wants a carbon copy band.
1,Panic! at the sounds exactly like fall out boy,"c'mon now. These guys sound exactly like fall out boy, and fall out boy is bad enough. It's annoying, whiny, and completely uneccesary. There's plenty of decent emerging rock bands but these guys just aren't one of them. I'm not usually one to put down a band because i have respect for all musicians, but i feel it is necessary in this case. It's just plain bad. Even their song titles are obnoxious because they're long and meaningless. Please, do yourself a favor and do not listen to this band. If people listen to and encourage this kind of music modern rock and roll will just continue on the downward spiral it's been taking ever since the emergence of this kind of god awful music. Bottom line: do not listen to panic! at the disco"
3,3 and a half stars!,"Panic! At The Disco is getting a lot of comparisons to Fall Out Boy. Yes, they have VERY similar voices. Buts its like someone took away Fall Out Boys electric guitars and put in more dance/disco sounds. I could imagine listening to it at a party! I have mostly all their songs on my iPod and they are very iffy. It really depends on your taste. Some songs are GREAT but some are..well horrid.I Constantly Thank God For Estebanis one of the best songs they have! LOVE IT!Maybe try the CD from the library and see what you think! If you like it..buy it!If you like more guitar and personal lyrics go check out Fall Out Boys - From Under The Cork Tree. Thats a great CD!"
4,good but odd,this is a awesome cd but really wierd... plus this guy from the band ryan ross looks like a girl but w/e th songs r pretty good but really unusuali love track #2 and track #10 theyr awesome i nkow i souns like a poser or w/e u wanna call it cuz those are the popular song that everyone know cuz they always on the radio but w/e yeah it pretty good most people will probly like it but if youre a real hardcore music fan i mean the style of music or like real rock music this is a little more pop or techno pop or w/e u wanna call it its good u might wanna listen to some song online before you buy it cuz its the kinda music thats its like either you like it or you hate it its wierd but preview th songs or sumthin before buying it i own it and i like it just not as much as some other things but yeah it good buy it if u like unusual sounding music... yeah hope i helped!
4,Just good music,"Chariodic just calm down and breathe alright buddy it will be okay. Some people do enjoy catchy punk/pop tunes. And what are you talking about how you can't combine the two? You can combine any two genre's of music! Its quite simple you just include certain qualities of both in your songs. Your either thinking way to hard about this or you are one of those conforming non comformist who hates anything that hints mainstream. For those of you who just enjoy great music this is a good album, not great, but good. Their style is not original but they add their own flavor to it. In one word ""refreshing"""
3,An ok cd,This was a pretty good cd it kind of gets annoying though because of the singers voice he sounds like exactly the same in most of the songs and most of the songs sound the same
3,what?,"This show was OKAY! I think it was simply overrated while on tv. I personally don't understand why you'd waste $200 on some dvds. I think it's pretty silly to spend that kind of money on dvds, but I guess if you have the money to throw away!? Overall, save your money the show wasn't that great."
1,I'm sorry,Friends just ripped off their fans. Asking for more money for a complete series box set. That's sad to hear.
1,Not worth it!!,"I have attended this event every year since 1997 and the festival organizer switched video production companies. The result is a poorly shot, poorly edited overpriced video, which is really sad because I was at the actual event. There were horrible camera angles, muffled sound and the whole winner's ceremony was cut out."
1,Disspaointed,"Having read the original I was very dissapointed in this version. I really looked forward having the portablilty Kindle offers on this biography. However, so much has been edited out that I remember and looked forward to. This does not replace the orignal. I look forward to seeing the original on Kindle. If you read the 4 book series don't buy this."
5,12 Months and Up a WONDERFUL bib,Loved this bib once my oldest turned a little over a year. He is now 2.5 and it works great. It is still too big/uncomfortable for my 10 month old though so I cant reco this for under a year. I actually purchased this at BuyBuy Baby but loved it so much it was worth writing a review.
2,A bit too bulky,"My son hated this. Even though it is soft, it was just too much bib for him (even at 15 months) because it is rather big at the bottom. Because we use a Fischer Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, it's a little snugger than a regular high chair, and the bottom of the bib impeded his movements somewhat. He also didn't like how the bib attached to his neck; he was really bothered by it. We were really disappointed because we thought it was so cute and were excited by all the good reviews. Oh well, I guess we'll try it on child #2 when the time comes and see if we have better luck."
5,Best bib you can buy!,I had this bib for my first two children. Then I had a third baby this past spring and needed a new one. I ordered a pink bib that has the softer silicone material. It truly keeps baby clean and it is a breeze to clean up. It is the only bib worth owning!
4,BabyBjorn BIb,"Great product. Nice colors. Easy to clean. It catches most of the food spills. The only one thing, it could be a little bit wider on the shoulders. My 6 moths old moves her head from side to side and very often food ends on her clothes."
5,nice baby little thing,"I bought this for a present for my friend's baby. It looks like a really good thing to have when you have a baby. Very helpful. I wish it was made from just a little bit softer material. But maybe it will last longer when it is not, so I can't tell that's a bad thing about it. It's a good purchase, I would buy the same for my baby. I have it in red, the colour is so good, looks really cute."
3,Material too hard,"Great for catching drips when training for open cup and starting finger foods. However, the material this is made of was much harder than we expected. My son is constantly yanking at it and he doesn't like it (seems uncomfortable). The pocket in front sticks out too far, making it difficult to fit behind the tray on our spacesaver high chair. Overall, good idea, but would work better with a more flexible material."
2,Doesn't fit around the neck comfortably,While I do have a chunky baby this never fit him correctly. I purchased this when he was four months old. It fit then but was very uncomfortable looking. I tried it the other day again since he is starting to feed himself now and like the idea of being able to just wash it in the sink. He is now 9 months old and it does not fit at all. it would not fasten and he would not leave it on. I love the concept and if he was not so chunky it would probably be a great product. My son is 23.6 pounds at 9 months to give you an idea of his size.
5,The Best Bib,"Baby Bjorn did it again. The Soft Bib is the very best bib that we have found. We went through alot of bibs (and $) before we found the Soft Bib. I was orignally reluctant to buy the Baby Bjorn because I thought it would be too small, and I thought it was a bit pricey. I therefore bought a cheaper brand of the formed bib, but it's hard plastic edge dug into my son's neck and left red marks. When I finally got the soft bib I was so impressed. Well worth the money.It is so well designed and durable. It catches EVERYTHING! and is very comfortable for my son. The plastic is very soft and flexible. And it turns out the size was not an issue at all. My son is large for his age (97th percentile), but this bib still fits him just fine at age 2 1/2. And it is a snap to clean. Just rinse under the faucet. If I was designing the perfect bib, this would be it."
5,Great for self-feeding toddlers,"This bib was a little too big for my infant when we first purchased it, but beyond his first birthday, it's our favorite bib. It catches everything his little hands drops, washes up easily and even goes in the dishwasher. Must have."
1,Baby yanks it right off,Baby is able to tug straight down on this bib and it comes right off. Super frustrating! In search of the other plastic bib that has a more locking-like closure.
3,"Great, until she learned how to take it off","What a great bib, and so easy to rinse off or clean in the dishwasher. Nice that it catches water too, as my daughter learns to use a cup.But once she hit 9 months, she learned how to pull it off and now pulls it off every time we put it on. We've given up, and are now using cloth bibs with velcro that aren't as easy for her to pull off."
2,Not Wearable For Baby (great otherwise),"Both my girls complained that this bib hurt them. They have tried numerous other types and brands of bibs before, and this is the only one they said hurt. Both of them refused to wear this bib. Neither the fastening strap that goes around the neck or the plastic bib material are soft. The fastening strap around their neck especially bothers them. The stiff bottom part of the bib pushes into the high chair tray and makes my daughters' uncomfortable.The bib is a breeze to clean and the pocket is by far the very best of any bib for catching and holding fallen food or spills. The colors are attractive and the material durable.I hope Bjorn can find a way to redesign this bib so that it is actually soft and comfortable (wearable), while maintaining its excellent function."
5,The best of all bibs,"I tried a lot of bibs, and felt this was the best. There is room for my little one to move her arms in front of her to pick up food, where that was a problem with a similar design bib. It connects around the neck with out choking her and has more than 3 notches to choose from when adjusting to fit around your babies neck. The food obviously makes it in the bottom of the bibn(most of the time), as inteded. Easily washed off. I've done away with all my other bibs and will be requesting more of these."
5,The BEST beginner book on stock trading!,"I have bought this book at least six times since the 5th edition came out, simply because I recommend it to EVERYONE who asks me for a good beginner's book on stocks and I loan them mine, never to get it back again!I read dozens of books on the ins and outs of buying stocks and found none to be as detailed as this. It starts assuming you know practically nothing and explains everything in laymen's terms. The parts on dealing with a broker (defining all the common terms), and short selling are especially excellent. You can become a stock trading expert (or at least sound like one :) very quickly with this book. Even ""old-hands"" will learn a thing or two from this handy book.If you like this book, I also recommend the older title, ""How I made a million dollars trading stock""."
1,Waste of time and money,"Far too basic, primitive and irrelevant to be useful for anybody trying to understand the stock market. Do not even get close to the today's stock market with the book. No PRACTICAL value at all. Go for ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" by W.J.O'Neil - a far superior practical guide to what, when and how in the stock market."
2,Confusion Reigns,"A friend of mine and I have been debating this book for awhile. He called it a modern day classic western (an oxymoran, but hey)while I was just confused. I seemed to have missed some major chunks of plot. Like the ones that connect the story into something cogent. Or, maybe I missed an intricate one-liner hidden amoungst the terse prose that would have explained everything. I know there's a couple of bad guys and there are a couple of good guys, and the bad guys are killing the good guys and the other bad guys over some heroin money found by one of the good guys. Some of good guys die early on in the book and then you're left to root for an aging sheriff who ruminates without much advancement of the plot. Or did I miss the point of that also? I've never been the biggest Cormac McCarthy fan, and now I know why. Read it and see for yourself."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is a tedious read. I haven't seen the movie, but I am sure the Coen Bros have done a great job as always. Nevertheless, McCarthy's writing style is painful to read. He is too cool for quotation marks--what is the point of that? Is it the IMPACT? That's what the whole book seems to be about, so again, it is probably a fantastic action movie. But in print form, I'd say it would be much better as a graphic novel. Unfortunately it comes accross as something that an 8th grader might write if he were held captive on a snow day and forced to spill his adolescent imagination onto paper (I imagine he'd write in red ink)."
3,book- NO Country For Old Men,I purchased this novel because I enjoyed the film adapted from the Book and wanted to see how they compared. I think I might have enjoyed the book more if I had read it before I had seen the film. The writing is different. The thoughts of Sheriff Bell seem to be dragged out. I wish that there were more descriptions of the characters as to how they looked. I would like to read more of this author's works.Rick
5,Great,I am a huge fan of Mr. McCarthy. I have read all his books and this is one of my absolute favorites.
4,A Book about Life and Outcomes,"Good read, asks some good questions and made me reevaluate some things. My e-book version was missing much important punctuation including quotation marks. This complicated the read."
3,sad country for old men,"Gripping plot, authentic description of the desert country, hard,cynical concluson about the human condition. good read"
4,Not for the faint of heart,"I picked this book up at the library after seeing a preview of the upcoming movie starring Tommy Lee Jones. Therefore as I read the face and voice of Tommy Lee Jones became a part of the book -- which might have actually helped me get into this.As others have summarized the story, it is way violent, brutal, depressing, and cold. However, there are some real jewels of wit, compassion, and wisdom scattered throughout. The one thing that made me give this a 4 rather than 5 was the sometimes too lengthy and detailed description of guns and weapons. I don't have a clue about one gun from the next; however, I'm sure someone more familiar with this would appreciate this.This is not my favorite book of all time, but I'm glad I read it. It's a fast paced crime/detective novel that is well written and has some places that are impossible to put down. I'm anxiously awaiting the movie."
4,"great book, great author","First of all, Cormac McCarthy is one of my new favorite authors. I read this book before any of the others, and was immediately struck by his unique writing style, which was difficult to navigate at first. I was almost tempted to quit the book because it was so strange. But his narrative concerning the atmosphere, the world around his characters, is so detailed, so remarkable, it makes it an incredible read. You begin to love the characters, and truly want to fight for them. I read this book in two days. Once you're in the meat of the story, it's a ride until you finish it. Sometimes you beg for the happy ending, (which isn't possible with McCarthy), because his characters seem intent on following the long road of their demise. Can't wait to read 'The Road.'"
3,Not As Bad As They Want You To Believe!,"In the wake of The Road and its near-universal acclaim, this admittedly lesser work has been ravaged by critics. It's quite a backlash. Yes, The Road is a far-superior work. A true masterpiece. But No Country For Old Men isn't bad at all! It's a totally different style for McCarthy, and it's a welcome detour.No Country For Old Men is more of a comedy than anything. I think the movie adaptation will be fantastic. I would highly recommend this to anyone, any day of the week. Will it get you thinking like The Road? Will it have the emotional impact of that novel? No. But it's a fine, entertaining read in its own right."
3,Lost Me,"I recently read McCarthy's ""The Road"", which I enjoyed quite a bit. I thought it was a powerful and important novel, one that I won't forget. I didn't feel the same about ""No Country for Old Men"". I thought that several characters in this novel were one-dimensional and forgettable. Sure, the story had some intense moments that got my heart pumping quickly, but the story seemed to drag -- at least for me. I ended up skimming the last thirty or so pages."
4,Short Changed,"I would love to see the original manuscript, whilst the publishers will be happy with the success of Cormac McCarthys book ""No Country for old men"", I cant help thinking that this book has been trimmed to appeal.Yes it's a great story, it will make a great movie. But it could have been great (and probably was ) rather than very good."
2,Reads like a movie script for a shoot em up movie.,Story stumbles as the characters stumble through the events in the book. Prose is often appealing but there is no plot development. I do not recommend this book.
5,best of Cormac..,"my favorite Cormac McCarthy book..gritty, harsh, blunt and bitter..a gem..McCarthy's world is a desolate wasteland inhabitated by harsh men and even harsher realities..not for the faint of heart..."
3,An average entertainer,"It's an entertaining story, but I didn't find anything deep or profound in either the narrative or the underlying themes. Indeed, from the beginning, the book feels like it was written with the objective of turning it into a movie in mind. There are also a couple of questionable aspects. Why does Moss not kill Chigurh when he has the chance? Why does Chigurh - an embodiment of out and out evil - deliver the bounty to some random figure? While one can come-up with a reasonable answer to the first question, the latter is unbelievable."
1,"a disjointed, disturbing novel","where the sociopath kills everyone. Maybe we should build the wall between Texas & the US, rather than Mexico & the US. And if we can make the wall retroactive to the 1980s, we would all be better off."
3,A schizophrenic novel about a psychopath,"NO COUNTRY is an uneasy hybrid of pulp and literary fiction. The portions which follow a psychopathic killer and his doomed prey are highly effective; that's the ""pulp"" part. Much less effective, in my opinion, are the ""literary"" portions, in which an elderly sheriff sinks into a disillusioned retirement. Thus, you have a book containing many moments of electrifying suspense, followed by dull moments of deep ruminations, which are supposed to give weight to the bloody sequences of violence. Although the quality of the writing is strong from beginning to end, this book kept me at a distance; it just didn't engage me."
5,FROM A SOLDIERS,"This is my first time doing this. I seen this movie here in Killeen,Texas in 2009 after finishing my 2nd tour. This movie hit home for me because it tells my story and my fellow soldiers story like i never seen. I will have everone i know go and support this film and i will show my sister so she will have a complete idea of what we go thru when we are deployed. Jake Rademacher has done the impossible and i thank him"
3,Well written but.............,"Although Strip City is very well written, Burana's insights are often frustratingly simplistic. There's no bigger picture here, in terms of both herself and the human condition. I still have no clue as to what truly drives her journey, other than it being a vehicle for her to get a book published.Strip City has an immature quasi-honest feel to it- most ""confessions"" coming too easily and predictably.I finally had to put the book down at the halfway point - I was so irritated. Granted, the second half of the book may have improved enormously, (although I saw no signs of that) but I don't think that makes it worth suffering through the first half. Burana is obviously very bright and articulate, but she needs to dig a lot deeper."
1,Vacuous and superficial,"This book was tedious reading at best. The author wasted the first 32 pages descibing how a cowboy with a missing front tooth swept her off her feet. She was dazzled by this cowboy's statement ""I may not win every fight I'd get in to defend you, but I'd die trying."" Please, is this a line from WWF?? The book deals with the women and the men in the clubs in a very superficial way. The reader never really gets any great understanding of the dynamics of this business. Don't waste your money!"
5,Best of Preston&Child I've Read Thus Far,No cliches here...Simply more entertaining and gripping than Relic which I also enjoyed. The suspense builds to a crescendo and resolution is satisfying. Pendergast is is revealed to be mortal after all but we begin to understand the forces which shaped his being.Dave Marain
4,Best so Far,"I have listened to the first two books in the Pendergast series through Audible and bought this book only because Audible didn't record The Cabinet of Curiosities. Of the first three books this was the best, you got to see a side of Agent Pendergast that was not shown in the first two of the series. He became a little more human, more real than the pale man in the black suit. A tiny bit of his history is revealed.My only complaint with the books is the way that the authors portray the police in New York City. In all three of these novels- with the exception of one character, the police are made to appear bumbling, idiotic and arrogant. It gets a bit old.I will continue with the series as I find Pendergast to be intriguing and hope that his character fleshes out some more."
4,Why?,"Why is it that I can buy a paperback edition of this book for $4 and the kindle edition is over $5??? When I bought my kindle I thought wow great but the prices of the non paper non reselling books are way more that I can buy real books for. Books that I can resell, trade or give to friends. This is very disappointing and really totally unjustified. There are no printing costs no paper costs which I thought as a consumer would be passed on to me as a much less expensive end product. To say that I am disgusted it the least of it. Why is everything about money any more? I miss the 50's and the 60's.Possibly if the prices were lower the volume of selling would be so much that the people that ""so desperately need"" the money so badly would make it on the volume of sales. When I was a kid the more people used a product the less it cost. Now it seems that is the opposite the ore use it the more it cost."
4,Good book but bit of a drag,Plot is excellent but the book is too long and a bit boring at a few places.
5,Just creepy enough!,This was a great read! I was anticipating The Sureons next move up to the very end! A few parts drug a little but then it picked right back up! This entire series is fantastic!
4,Another great book by great authors,If you have ever read any of my other reviews then you already know that i am a huge fan of the Preston-Child books. COC was a great book that reminded me so much of a Jack the Ripper sort of tale in this day and age. Many characters from previous books come together to make this just a very fun read. The best part about these books is that even though characters from other books are in their books you hardly ever have to read the other books to catch up. You can almost pick up any other their books and enjoy the read.COC was probably one of the best books i have read in a while. Take some time and read this thriller and i guarentee that you will get hooked on this series of books.
1,Awful. How can people like books like these?,"The characters are as cliche as a bad soap opera. The plot is as believable as an issue of The National Enquirer, and it has about as much suspense as a Sunday morning news show.I just can't understand how people can read this garbage and think it was a good book."
4,"A Little of the Old, A Little of the New","Douglas and Preston's Cabinet of Curiosities will be a treat for their fans and could even create a few more to add to their number. The set up is fascinating with thirty six dead bodies being unearthed from the 1870s before the dead bodies in the present time also start piling up. The authors keep the pace moving and the tension high, even at points where credibility dips and the twists become a little more predictable. The horror shifts from creeping terror to gross-out squeamishness and then back again with relative ease. It is a fast-paced summer type read that makes one wish it was not the depths of February."
3,Not as good at the authors' other books,"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed all of the other Preston/Child books. The Ice Limit and Riptide are my favorites.One of the things that make the books a cut above other science/adventure books written by authors like Clive Cussler, is the fact that the subject matter is plausible, and the characters are not too over the top.Cabinet of Curiosities was hard for me to enjoy because it was just too unbelievable to take seriously.Not a bad book, but their earlier offerings are all superior pieces of work."
5,This is not an anti-religion book,"As a Christian who is disgusted with faith healers and televangelists, I applaud Mr. Randi for writing this book. He carefully dissects the ""ministries"" of the con artists he looks at, showing each to be built on a mountain of lies. He does so with passion and a touch of righteous fury. He is also careful not to disparage people of faith in general, but only those who abuse religion for their own despicable ends.Whether Randi is an agnostic or atheist, I do not know. But I do know he is a man of conscience, who has sent out a warning message that all should heed. It is a tragedy that more Christians aren't willing to listen.I fully expect to see Mr. Randi in heaven. I thank God for him and pray for his well-being. I do not have the same sympathies towards the monsters he exposes in this powerful book. Benny Hinn, Robert Tilton, and the rest of you scum, be warned: you can't hide behind sheep's garments anymore."
5,Great teaching tool!,Beautifully filmed and directed!! I use this fim in the classroom but also enjoy watching it as enlightened entertainment. Would recommend!
4,Great!,"I think the camera work and picture quality are superb in this video. On par with the Central Park DVD as far as that aspect is concerned. The only bad thing (in my opinion) is that the show itself wasn't super awesome holy &*#@ spectacular (like say...the Central Park concert). Would have been better if they had made Live Trax 10 from Portugal a DVD instead of this show. Nonetheless, if you're a DMB fan, you'll love this dvd!"
4,What one would expect,"It was just the 100 lb addition. There were no surprises in getting the upgrade; you get more weight, it gets a little harder. The bowflex weights are highly unrealistic though. I am able to bench all 410 lbs more than once. I weight about 180 lbs and there is no way I can actually bench 410 lbs. I can probably do half of that, but the bowflex was made for convenience, in which it has succeeded. The weight is worth getting if you plan on staying with the bowflex and you need more weight."
4,Excellent home gym,I have owned a Bowflex for more than ten years now. The one I have now is the Bowflex Sport. For overall size and weight this type of home gym is excellent and easy to use. The power rods are especially good for injury rehabilitation and for older users. The resistance is less at the beginning of the exercise and helps to prevent strain on joints and tendons.
2,Program is great but CD's are a waste of time,"I don't know who wrote it originally, but I concur: the software program 'Family Tree Maker' is great. It's easy to use, offers a variety of ways to organize your family data, and lots of options for printouts. But you will be wasting your time and money to purchase any edition with the CD's. In the first place, you'll be wasting your time viewing the CD's. I've studied about 15 of them and never found one piece of pertinent information or genealogical leads. However, if you insist on looking, then go to your local LDS Family History Center where most of the CD's are available for viewing. A better use of time at your local FHC would be to study the materials they have available. In addition there are live people working there who are both knowledgeable and helpful and who can and will answer most of your genealogy questions."
4,good value for the price,fits perfect into the FZ8 camera but unfortunately not the same capacity than the original
2,look good but fit wrong,i bought these for my R6 they look good in picture and in person. but they fit very badly on bike. I guess you get what you pay for
2,BLIND ME!!!!,"I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A NEW STROLLER AND WHEN I SAW THIS ONE, IT WAS JUST TO UGLY TO BUY. I LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT, BUT THEY COULD JUST HAVE MADE A DECENT COLOR FOR IT. THEY KEEP MAKING STROLLERS SO UGLY NOW!!!!!!! AND THE GREAT LOOKING STROLLERS ARE CHEEZIE OR ARE SO EXPENSIVE. COME ON MANUFACTURERS'."
2,Still a great voice but...,A great voice but no Jim Steinman on production and it shows. The songs have NO epic quality to them. Just compare them to the hidden Bat Out Of Hell track and they simply don't compare. Everything seems SO under-produced compared to Loaf's other material. It's a great shame but I would strongly suggest you give it a miss. It's a let down.
2,Don't believe the subtitle!,"This book is quite an interresting reading, but has absolutely none common part with the MCSD exam '70-100'.There are the so-called 'case study' parts in the book, which form a continuous story, helping very well to understand the basic principles of MSF, Microsoft's architecture model. I think this part of the book is very good. The other parts - well, not my style. Dry text and theory. Frankly I almost fell asleep reading those chapters.However the real problem is the subtitle of the book, - referring to MCSD and 70-100. I have just passed the exam (some hours ago) but I haven't met a single question connecting to this books' material. Simply the exam is entirely something different.So if you are interrested in MSF, read the 'case studies' of this book. A best to understand it. For any other purposes (including exam prep) I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Absolutely nothing about 70-100,"70-100 is one of the hardest exams for MCSD certification. You really need a lot of experience for this exam.This book is a very nice for organizing or restructuring your company or team to use MSF, but DO NOT waste your time preparing yourself for the exam. Find something else. The exam does not contain anything about MSF and it's models. It just tests your knowledge of the real world problem. How would you do this, What would you suggest, etc. This book does not contain this sort of information. Either you gain a lot of experience or some experience + some other book. So why three stars. Well it helped me realise how the big companies prepare for the software development and the methods they use. It is also a very good reference."
1,DO NOT buy this book!,"This book has absolutely nothing to do with what's on the 70-100 exam. It's over 650 pages of wasted time. I can't think of a single question on that exam the this book helped me answer. I am not exaggerating. Instead go for the Exam Cram book, if you can find it... ISBN 1-57610-378-1."
1,Terrible book!,"Please, please, please if you are a true Moody Blues fan don't bother buying the book. There is nothing NEW in this book that can't be fond on the internet or the Moody Blues Web site or ""Higher & Higher"". The pictures of the band are nice."
1,"Snap, crackle, pop","The cordless extension handsets make loud clicking and popping sounds at random times during conversations. These are extremely annoying and are sometimes uncomfortably loud. There are other glitches as well, but this is by far the worst. If you need a cordless phone, I strongly recommend purchasing a different product."
1,"The 2420 Was So Bad, I'm Afraid of This One","I have the 2420 . . the 8825's predecessor. When I first got it, I thought it was great. My partner and a close friend both got them on my recommendation. Within weeks, we all experienced what can only be decribed as ""garbled"" conversations . . . like we were talking underwater. Called Customer service and they said to just reboot the system. Cleared it up for a week or two. Switched handsets around. One would always have the problem. We all had this exact experience. I like the looks and functions on the Siemens, but my experience, echoed by those who have apparently purchased the 8825, makes me fearful to replace my old junk with new junk. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on ME!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SYSTEM,"I was an owner of Siemens Gigaset System. Nice concept but AWFUL, AWFUL hardware. The system finally gave out this past week after numerous gliches. Siemens did not stand behind their inferior product. I just bought the Panasonic 5.8 ghtz set. Much better."
1,Siemens Bad Deal,"We ordered this phone and have had problems with it from Day 1. The base station phone has a strange connection that may occur at any time during a conversation that sounds like you are in a barrell. This appears to be a common issue with the phone, as we have had numerous conversations with Siemans Customer Service working us through several complicated steps to correct the problem.After these efforts failed, we were instructed to return the phone for a replacement. We were not informed that Siemans does not have any phones to send us, so we are waiting for over 3 months to get a replacement. When speaking to their Customer Service, they offer no compensation, no refund, no nothing. Just tell us to wait. ""They don't have any ability to help us"".What a horrible phone, lousy customer service and lousy factory response.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!"
1,Don't even think of buying this product,"It simply doesn't work well and Siemens won't accept any responsbility. I bought the base and 4 extensions. None of them work well at all. When listening, the earpiece ""warbles"" so you can't carry on a conversation. This is near the base, far from the base, everywhere. It doesn't do it all the time, but is totally exasperating. Staples was nice enough to exchange some of the handsets, but nothing changes. Also, beware the microwave oven! Anytime you are near an operating microwave oven, you can't hear a thing over the interferance. I really liked the phone when I first got it, but within a week or two, it started developing problems. My sister in law got the same phone system and has the exact same problems. Don't ever buy Siemens products... customer no-service is awful!"
1,Don't waste your money on a Siemens phone system,"It's unfortunate that one star is the lowest possible rating available, because this company deserves a minus five stars for its poor product and complete lack of customer support. Our very expensive system with five handsets worked when it was brand new, but four of the handsets have failed one by one and cannot be repaired. The company offers no support whatsoever, and the ""self-service"" web site doesn't work either. As of today the base unit of our system also stopped working on one line, so we are down to one line with one handset. We are shopping for a new phone system, but it will not be a Siemens."
1,It was good while it lasted...,"I replaced the 2400 series with this 8800 series unit. At the beginning, I was so excited... This system sounds wonderful, has improved battery life, and sports a very solid build. But guess what, months down the road, all the problems started to hit. Display died on one handset, voice started to clip and gets choppy on another. The answering system started to malfunction-hanging up on people before they finish their messages. While much improved over the 2400 series, this newer system definitely has a set of problems of its own. Don't buy it! I've dumped over $... between the 2400 and 8800 series, but at the end, my old $... Panasonic analog sounds better and lasts longer. I guess the myth about German engineering and quality control is only a myth..."
1,Box-Office Poison,The viewer from New York overrated this film by giving it only two stars...what a waste of time!
5,Excellent,This product arrived in excelent condition and on time. I would not have a problem ordering from this vender in the future.
4,This mics are really cool,I just recieved these mics and put the batteries and and they were ready to use. The range on them is amazing. I ran through my house singing and never lost signal once. A totally great value in my opinion.
1,Waste of time buying this product,"A microphone does not work, not to load the batteries instruction manual is very poor information is a complete dump these products; do not waste your money on this.I'll definitely going to return this item."
1,The Emperor's New Clothes;Again,"There is no requirement that Jews take Judaism seriously-and there is also no reason-or requirement to define Judaism without God-or to use the title,'Judaism Beyond God' as Judaism in any sense.Sherwin Wine,who was ordained as a Reform rabbi,came to believe that God is irrelevent to Judaism-and founded ""Humanistic Judaism"",marketing himself on TV talk shows and the local Detroit Jewish News(currently JN)-and is unfortunately taken seriously-but not by PT Barnum.Fans of his,with any sense of consistency,hopefully also believe that The Constitution should be irrelevent to lawyers. If anything,this book-written in the eighties- formally solidifies Wine-who believes that God is irrelevent-as one of the three most overrated Jews of all-time ,along with Spinoza(God and nature are the same)and ""Rabbi""Mordecai Kaplan,founder of ""Reconstructionist Judaism"",who believed that 'God is a cosmic Process.' Buy the book by Hans Christian Andersen,instead."
1,"worst shoes EVER, DON'T BUY IT",I usually don't review products but I had to tor this one. ITS THE WORST SHOES EVER. it ripped after 2 weeks. my knee started hurting like nothing else. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Its low low quality product.
4,tennis shoes,"This is really a nice shoe but was half size smaller so i can not wear them.Also I wanted to buy a mid version, but unfortunately ordered the low one."
1,'05 Element owners beware!,"2005 Element owners beware! Even though this Hopkins claims this part fits your '05 Element, it doesn't. The actual connector that is suposed to plug into your car is completely different from the one in the package. It's very frustrating to pay Blue shipping, tear the rear of the car apart and then find out it doesn't fit!"
1,Dont like,"I dont like anything about this shoe. I ordered this shoe along with a different pair both same brand. Both size 8. This pair was a little too big and the other pair was too small (my foot hung off the back). I dont like the way this shoe looks on my foot. It looks quite ugly...the top, bottom, back.. all parts of the shoe is ugly. And theres splotches all over the entire shoe. Im honestly not sure what color the shoe is supposed to be bc half of it is dark and the other lighter. But its in splotches. I would be embarrassed to wear it out bc it doesnt look right. Dont buy this shoe. Its ugly and it has mistakes."
2,dissastified,i was unaware that this dvd was a blue ray i only wanted a regular dvd either i missed it or it did not show
4,entertaining and funny,"City Island is a story about the dysfunctional Rizzo family. It is really all about their individual secrets, which each of them tries to conceal from the others. While the movie is funny in spots it does not have the clever dialogue that would make it stand out among other more funny family-oriented movies such as ""Juno."" Some of the characters could be fleshed out a little better, but overall City Island is a pleasant movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family."
3,ELECTRONIC POP SAMPLER INDEED,"The first thing I noticed was that none of the 14 singers with (the exception of FREEZEPOP)have good voices, in fact they are quite bad.I felt that there is nothing new or fresh for me in this cd, plenty of Depeche Mode, Erasure, Soft Cell, Human League & High Energy sound and bites to all of the songs, but, then again... nothing really good or that stands out other than FREEZEPOP, SILICON 39, NASA ( so remind me of LEVEL 42) and the best track "" EVERYTHING I THOUGH I HAD TO BE "" by COLOR THEORY are the only highlights of the CD.Great as a sampler, but, would really doubt if I will purchase any or the artist individually in this CD other than the highlights I mentioned."
2,Many of these are not the original songs!!!,"You know I have many fond memories of this album. Especially, my brothers and I running around the living room to Beep, Beep. However, that song in particular is not the orignal version and the new one is terrible. You can almost make out the original playing behind some guy ranting about his new Cadilac. Which adds nothing to the orignal song.Songs I thought could tell were originals - Purple People Eater, Charlie Brown, Here comes the Judge, The Jolly Green Giant and Mr. Custer.The original was The Playmates, ""Beep Beep"". I should have been more careful. Use the titles to look up the original artists and buy them elsewhere."
5,Not enough stars for this one,"Okay, so Alter Code F stunk, right? So this should be no different, right? Wrong to the max! This game is off da chains 30+ hours of entertainment extreme! This was the best game I've played since Dragon Quest VIII, and my favorite Wild Arms ever. I just couldn't stop playing. Fun but simple platforming, innovative battle system, unique characters, and nostalgic enemies galore (gob gob). To the non-WA fan, maybe not so, but to the WA fan, maybe so!"
2,No CTCSS subcodes,"I ordered these and was terribly disappointed to find that they don't support CTCSS subcodes. That means that you're limited to 14 channels, not 14 channels * 38 subcodes = 532 channels. As you can imagine, the difference between 14 and 532 makes a huge difference when you're trying to use these at someplace crowded, like Disneyworld. Their performance is OK, as is the build quality-- not bad for the money-- but the lack of subcodes is a killer."
4,Good product for the money,"These radios have worked well for us under most conditions- at the lake, in Mexico, and car to car. The nice part about them is the rechargeable batteries and the included charger. The sound quality and range has been within acceptable limits for us, and has surprised us on occasion when they have been loud and clear thru forested areas and over hills. They have been subjected to jolts on the jet ski and minimal amounts of waterspray without apparent damage. They hold a charge for a long weekend. Overall we have been satisfied with the performance of these radios and feel they provide good performance at a fair price. My only (minor) complaint is that I have to consult the owner's manual to understand some of the various functions as the lettering near the buttons and dials is small and difficult to read."
5,Lovely!,A beautifully written book that is part of a tale that fits in well with S. M. Stirling's Change series.
3,"Reliable, easy to use","Ideas are presented clearly and explained well. I have tried some recipes and have been overall happy with them. I would like to see more illustrations and background info on certain topics, but overall this book doesn't really leave any major gaps nor does it provide way too much info for the competent, non-pro cook to ""digest."""
3,"Pretty book, but shallow","This is a very pretty book, and it does cover a breadth of material, but it's very shallow. An entire book could be devoted to each chapter. It provides a good overview of what can be done with clay, but in the end, I have to turn to other books to get more than a cursory understanding of individual processes."
5,Pottery book,This is the best potter's handbook for teaching beginning students that I have ever used. Wonderful ideas and great examples for the illustrations!
4,Well worth it.,"I really am enjoying reading this book. It applies to all the people you love in your life. If you have the desire to improve your relationships, you will like it. The book is written in a very conversational manner, and is easy to understand. I think husband and wife (or significant other) would benefit from both reading the book. Taking turns reading each chapter, and then discussing it, and working to put it in practice. Maybe read a few a week, spread out over time. Thank-you to the Carlson's for sharing these insights."
5,THIS BOOK IS GREAT,"AFTER 46 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, I READ THIS BOOK AND LEARN SO MUCH THAT COULD HAVE MADE MY MARRIAGE STRONGER THROUGH THE YEARS. IT IS A MUST-READ FOR MARRIED COUPLES AND ANYONE IN LOVE."
2,"entertaining, but...",The book is entertaining but very light. It took fewer than 2 hours to read. I wouldn't say it's worth purchasing.
2,Snippets of Information,"The Year 1000 by Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger has some interesting facts peppered throughout taken from a number of varied sources but most of the book is so light that it can float away, often while reading it. It takes the reader through a year in the life of an Englishman, although it sometimes feels more like the author's interests than the interests of the average medieval Englishman are presented. This book will not interest the person with more knowledge of the medieval period and could give a distorted vision of this time for the non-buff and leave the reader with more questions than answers."
3,"Dry, dull","Though the subject was interesting and new insights were provided, the book as a whole was dull and dry. The concept of showing everyday life on a seasonal basis could have been a complete joy to read, but unfortunately the authors seemed to think they were writing a Calculus book or other such thing of unenjoyment. As in the latter case, interesting facts get stale fast if not presented with some sort of readablility. Give me a work by Keegan or Ambrose anyday over this."
3,A very slow read...,An exhasperatingly detailed book that only chronicles the end of Gary Gilmore's life. Does not delve into his childhood or family history. Goes into great detail on things that are of little interest and importance to the overall story. Reads more like a textbook than a biography.
5,What about the afterwards?.....,"The BEST BOOK I have ever read. I have breathed and lived this book for about two weeks. I keep hearing the song from the new movie out (Meg Ryan, Nicolas Cage-can't remeber the name), anyway, the words are in essance this whole book. It is Gary and Nicole's song.BUT...I keep finding myself wondering what happened to Nicole? Her kids? Did she ever fall in love again? What about the other characters?**IF ANYONE HAS ANY INFO about any of the characters, please email me!! (davandtam@bigfoot.com).READ THIS BOOK!! Also, Shot in the Heart by brother Mikal Gilmore. Excellent job, Norman."
5,"Even the fan who knows ""everything"" will love this book","The greatest book about the greatest entertainer of all-time.This book is excellent and, of course, the best Elvis biography ever. The extent of Guralnick's research makes this a must read for everyone, even the Elvis fan who knows ""everything.""This book is told more from the Elvis' point of view than its sequel, and is, consequently, a much better book.This book goes a long way in convincing those ignorant in the history of music that true Elvis rock-n-roll is simply a melding of Country and R&B."
1,A semi-talented writer with NO ELVIS BACKGROUND,I am not impressed over Peter Guralnick whatsoever!WHO IS HE ACTUALLY?A longtime Elvis fan? NOAn Elvis collector? NOSomeone who followed Elvis around? NOA friend of Elvis'? NOJust how many Elvis concerts did ole Guralnick go to WHEN ELVIS WAS ALIVE? (impersonators don't count here?)
3,Quite good,"Really nice and detailed. The main body is out of 3 pieces, 2 fuselage parts and another one that goes over the cockpit. The fuselage parts fit good but that over-cockpit one was tricky, didn't fit that well so you will have to work on that with lots of patience. Pilot and co-pilot included."
1,???,This product was advertised to be compatible with the siriusXM Onyx radio which I purchases after I got theXact xS097 unit. I asked many people in the field of sirius radio know-how andall concluded that the unit camnnot be used with the onyx sirius XM.I hope You can either refund the charges or credit my sirius account in some way to compensate me.Please respond ASAP.Thank YouPaul Gordon Order # 189637 placed 6/8/2012
2,CD Player no good,"We thought this would be a good product for my daughter so she could play CD's in her room. Unfortunately, the CD player only worked for about 3 months. Now it says ""NO Disc"" for every disc we put in the player. It's not worth the cost of shipping to send it in for repair. The sound was good and we didn't use the satellite radio, so I can't comment on that feature."
4,Great pricefor a so-far good CD player,"I needed a new CD player for listening to audiobooks while doing kitchen chores, and this fits the bill perfectly. I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on it, so the low price and generally decent reviews sold me on this one."
2,very poor FM reception,"I purchased this as a radio boombox, but the fm is only pulling in one powerful radio station. My 40 year old 9 transistor pulls in 15 stations---go figure. AM works fine, speakers are loud enought, but on the flat side."
4,A Well Written History of the 2nd Punic War,"This book is full of wisdom and insight regarding the war between Rome and Carthage, part 2. The author looks at the primary sources critically and attempts to draw out the probable scenarios of the major points of the war. Personally I thought he did a great job regarding that. He has many maps at the end of the book so you can find out where the major action is happening without any problems. Although I wouldn't recommend it for a complete novice (i.e. someone who doesn't know a thing about ancient Rome) I think it is an excellent introduction to the finer points of the Second Punic War for anyone else."
4,Yu Yu Hakusho,"Yu Yu Hakusho was a very well-planned, well-drawn, and well-figured manga. It was my second manga I've read, and got me really interested in the artwork of Japan. Reading Yu Yu Hakusho caused me to become interested in other mangas, such as Rurouni Kenshin (READ IT), Naruto, and others...the author did very well with it. Read it! Honestly, I'm not joking. You'll like it. Yusuke, the main character, is a work of art and someone you can't help but laugh at...his misfortune and stupid bad luck make the book worth the while reading!"
1,rubbish,"My friend, Susan Morris -Haire also worked for the Galveston Daily news at this time. She is a wonderful artist, recently returned to the island. Please!!! Do not confuse her with the author of this ...trash. They are NOT the same person."
5,"Wonderfully accessible, relevant information","""The Young Athlete"" is a wonderful book containing comprehensive, accessible, and relevant information in an easy-to-read, thoughtful format about the many and varied issues confronting the young athlete. I think this book also has relevance to parents of children who may not be that athletic as the book discusses the development of children in general. The numerous anecdotes make the book interesting to read and convey that Dr. Metzl is a concerned physician who is genuinely interested in the welfare of his patients. The section at the back summarizing what should be done in certain emergency situations (which the authors encourage we photocopy and take with us in case the book is too bulky!) is a great indication of that concern and of the practical nature of this book."
5,informative and witty,"My husband and I both really enjoyed this book. We found Dr. Metzl's style to be informative, warm, and engaging. We have 4 young children involved in various sporting activities, we are never without at least one injury, and this book has several anecdotes that we really can relate to. Of particular value is Dr. Metzl's guide to emergency situations - which of course I recommended to the kids' coaches to keep in their first aid kits! We will be following some of Dr. Metzl's advice and look forward to his next book."
2,A FIASCO,"Yes, really dessapointed me.Where is Piazzolla ?, only in his voice.Hi Perspective, is fine.Compare with Madredeus Electronico, that one is a gem.More Hi-Perpective you can listen on the great Aubade Lecons de Tango CD. Another gem."
4,"A romantic coming of age story, with a vampiric twist.","Although the book does have it's grammatical errors (associated with Roeder), it is the plot that counts - and this story has a wonderful one. Graham is a fragile teen coming to grips with his homosexuality, throw into that the School Stud taking a liking to him, with a mysterious European kid named Josiah. And you get a formula for a great piece of literature."
3,Ha ha ha!,"This author's juvenile bumbling of the topic of lithium in general and hydrides in particular caused a distinct curving of my naso-labials. Ha ha ha! Of course, Mr. Amoretty (if that is his real name) did get the bit about thermal gravimetric analysis spot on, so props for that. All in all, more fun that weeding a pumpkin patch, but less fun than taking out the recycling after a big ole party."
4,Must see - Must Re-release...,I saw this movie as a kid and have been looking for a copy ever since. I can remember renting it over and over again and waiting until I was sure my parents were dead asleep before popping it in. A delightfully naughty movie! I'd love to see how it has held up among the recently attitude driven animation we are hit with today. (And to see if the movie was really that funny)
1,This book is a complete waste of time and money!,"This book completely ignores the mental aspect of Chi Kung.If you are interested in Chi Kung look at ""CHI GUNG"" by L.V. Carnie. ""Chi Gung"" covers both the physical (Wai Dan), and mental (Nei Dan) aspects of Chi Kung, and Tai Chi Chuan. ""Chi Gung includes between 80-110 exercizes.There are three spellings for the Chi Kung dicipline. Chi Gung, Chi Kung, and Qigong"
1,battlenet,"I have played this game since it came out..Unfortunately battlenet has not improved at all over the years, magic drops are low and bad(personally i think servers get cut of ebay sales)and the gameplay would be good if battlenet would clean up the frequent problems they have with lag and droping u from games, yes i have a high end comp, with a high end card and connection so dont ask."
3,"FORGET SOUNDTRACK, BUY SONGS 1 AT A TIME","ON THIS ALBUM, ONLY 2 SONGS ARE WORTHY OF YOUR TIME, BOSSA NOVA (GREAT SONG) AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY.IF YOU WANT TO BUY SONGS FROM ANY ELVIS SOUNDTRACK, I SUGGEST BUYING THEM ONE AT A TIME, AND NOT THE WHOLE ALBUM. YOU CAN SAMPLE THESE WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR A LISTING OF ELVIS SONGS (LIKE MP3) WHERE ALL OF HIS SONGS ARE ARRANGED ALPHABETICALLY AND NOT JUST THOSE TO ANY PARTICULAR ALBUM.ITS BEST TO SAMPLE EACH CLIP THEN DECIDE IF YOU CAN DEAL WITH ALL OF THE SONGS.PROBLEM WITH ELVIS SOUNDTRACKS (NOT ELVIS HIMSELF) IS THE MATERIAL HE WAS GIVEN, AND THE SONGS WERE WRITTEN FOR THE SITUATION IN THE FILM, AND NOT INTENED TO BE MORE THAN THAT.I WOULD APPROACH ALL OF THE SOUNDTRACKS THIS WAY. DON'T CONFUSE THE SOUNDTRACK WITH A NORMAL STUDIO ALBUM. ANY SOUNDTRACK TIED TO A MOVIE IS WHAT i AM DISCUSSING"
3,Oh! What it could have been.,"This is, unfortunately, a mis-titled book. It's really just a history of technological and organizational innovation in the five major armed forces it covers. It totally fails to discuss how the weapons and force structures that developed were used in combined arms systems on the battlefield.And this is odd. The author obviously understands his subject. Detailed examples and analyses are sitting in his brain. But they don't make it to the page. And this is unfortunate because this book is virtually the only one available that makes an attempt to address this crucial theoretical aspect of modern warfare.4 stars as a book on military evolution in the 20th Century. 2 stars as a book about combined arms. Average 3."
4,Riveting and haunting,"A compilation of short stories set in the rural South about the lives of African American men and women. The stories may be short but they are haunting and beautifully written. They are stories of love, fear, pain, acceptance, resignation, romance and determination. Not all the stories are pretty. Not all the stories are sad. But all the stories will leave a lasting imprint on your soul after you've read them."
4,Not great,"I like that you get to see the very first episode, but some of the other things bugged me. Like Ross' wedding to Emily. It was a cliff hanger - and it was REALLY a cliff hanger on these tapes - the second part doesn't come immediately after the first part - it comes after some other footage. That was extremely aggrivating. And some of the funniest episodes were left out and replaced by more familiar (read: I've seen them a hundred times in reruns) episodes. I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he's content with watching the same ten episodes over and over and over and OVER! But I'm not - I'd rather watch the reruns - complete with annoying commercials. I gave this four stars, though, because it IS a hilariously funny show - especially if you're seeing it for the first time."
2,It's okay but ...,"Okay, the show is good, very, very overrated but good. But paying... for this DVD is a waste of money! They show enough Friends reruns as it is! Just pay ten dollars for a pack of video tapes and tape them! Every time I turn around a Friends rerun is on! Geez!"
3,"If you are a ""Friends"" fan like me, DON'T BUY THIS!","When I first heard the they were having these couple episodes of the on DVD, I was very happy. I pre-ordered the set. But then I heard the news that Warner Brothers just released this set as a test to see if people would actually buy them. Knowing now that the DVDs were successful, they are going to begin releasing the show in seasons later this year. Instead of having to settle for the supposed 10 best episodes, you will be able to enjoy the series as a whole. So, don't waste money now with these, because in a few months us ""Friends"" fans will finally get what all of the ""X-Files"" and ""Sopranos"" people already have, the complete release."
1,DON'T BUY THIS SEAT,This car seat should be recalled we tried everything and it still tipped over:( Call the manufacturer if you have/had this seat and help get it recalled NO baby should be in this seat!!!!!! I'd give this car seat negitive stars if I could!
3,Beginner's?... Yes.... ....and no.,"If you've got experience in learning other languages; the format is extremely formal and logical. Yet because of this, even just as a beginner, one can find it very useful: the lessons are very condensed, short, and cover a lot of ground for a book of its size. (Mastering 'ty' books can get you back to the airport in a breaze... Mastering this book can have you sharing anechdotes with strangers once you're there.) To avoid grunting: find a friend to help you with more casual grammar and pronunciation. (the only REAL way to do it)"
5,Mel's video helped me fly fish five times better,"This DVD is so helpful. I had problems with my roll cast, but Mel's instructions helped me improve and move on to the next level. My friends used to laugh at my fly fishing, but now I can fish without being afraid of being embarrassed. I have all of Mel's videos and DVD's and I would recomend them to anyone who fly fishes, from a novice to an expert."
2,Not the best!,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book does something that very few self-defense books can, it gets the reader thinking about how they might possibly use their environment to protect themselves. However, the author demonstrates some ""iffy"" self-defense techniques with a hodgepodge of improvised items. Having taught realistic improvised weapon use for close to 10 years I can tell you that some of the techniques in this book could actually be more dangerous to the reader than the attacker.I might recommend this title for some ideas on the use of improvised weapons but would not recommend the application of all of the weapons covered or the techniques demonstrated."
2,There is a better way! Go to: www.gmedicine.com,"This book is decent but definitely NOT the best for your money because of one big factor: by the time you reach 3rd and 4th year in med school, this book has become way out of date!In the rapidly changing times of medicine, competitiveness for any particular specialty waxes and wanes. (...)"
5,a gentle listen,Phoebe's voice reminds me a stream with ripples flowing over and around the rocks. A very pleasing album.
1,THANK GOD ITS OVER........,"with the conclusion of this album,we are mercifully spared further ""punk rock"" classics from this pretentious group of egos -if you want to hear some innovation from this time period,pick up anything by the Minutemen.your money will go a lot farther..."
2,too small,"A good idea, but they are too small to cover the toilet seat. They should make them a bit bigger."
3,Like a LifeTime movie but no Judith Light...,"The author has real trouble with the way kids talk -- in this book they're like mini-adults. Granted, they ARE supposed to be gifted but I found myself wincing more than once. The too-helpful librarian also gave me pause and Mattie's mother's heartfelt chat with her ""Strange, solitary son"" was just awful.Wait for the paperback."
4,Crash Course on Crimes,"I left first year criminal law a little underwhelmed. After a lifetime of Law & Order, I just assumed that a law school crimes class would overwhelm me. But when class ended - and I felt normal - I figured I must have missed something.This book put criminal law into prospective and made it a little clearer. It's pretty much in outline form, with some memory aides, and a lot of sample questions (essay and multiple choice). What I found helpful, though, was that it found a way to be concise while still be thorough.The reality is that Criminal Law class really isn't that intense. You'll cover murder, privileges, common law crimes, and perhaps some of the Model Penal Code changes. Other study aides I've seen however, are overly long and unnecessarily complex. Criminal Law isn't that complicated. And this book makes no bones about it.The bottom line is that if you are looking for a criminal law study aide, this is a fine book to go with."
2,Condition of Book Ordered,"I am not happy with this product. I ordered, and paid for, a NEW book! This book was dingy, and smelled as if it had been in a garage or cellar for a long time. It was damp and the pages smelled of mildew. I am not exaggerating. I'm thinking of putting some Febreeze on it, as I'm just hoping the smell is not harming my health. I'm a law student, and I needed this book fast - so I have to keep it, and use it. But clearly, I'm not satisfied. And unless, the seller, fixes this and sends me another book that is (in fact) new. I will NOT recommend using this seller to anyone of my fellow students, friends, colleagues or co-workers.This is unfortunate."
2,"Decent features, bad sound",1. There was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when I tried multiple jacks for the base.2. Phone features worked as advertised. but the Voice Enhancer is useless and actually makes it sound worse.3. It was kind of a pain to sync the phone books which are separate on each handset.I returned it mainly because of the buzzing.
3,The Osbournes,"I'm not a BIG Ozzy Osbourne fan, but this show is pretty cool. The only thing I don't like about it is the constant swearing. The profanity doesn't offend me, but the 'bleeping' censorship does. Just about every word they say is 'bleeped' by the darn T.V. censors. But if this video is really uncensored, then I'll surely be buying it. The Osbournes is funny, crude, and moving at times. Ozzy might be old, but he's still cool. I don't care for his music too much, but The Osbournes are pretty cool."
4,Learn From My Fail,"I put this netting on top of three blueberry bushes in my back yard. Unfortunately, the netting was draped in a way so that I caught it in my riding lawn mower. Please note that this netting will get caught up in the lawn mower blades, wrap itself around the blades and then cause the mower to stall. Thankfully, after an hour of cutting this away from my blades, my mower was in working condition again. Alas, the netting is a jumbled mess and I have to order it again.Pros:-Keeps the birds off your blueberries!Cons:-Will get caught up in your lawn mower if you don't stake it down! Learn from my Fail"
5,Quality & value,"I had wanted an exhaust tip for my Toyota pickup to dress up the ugly exhaust pipe. Most I've seen at retail outlets are oversized tin cans. This was the right size for smaller vehicles, looks good, nice quality, good mounting system and reasonably priced."
4,Good intro to spey casting,"This is a great intro video about spey casting, especially for someone who has been a single handed overhead caster and wants to get into spey casting and double handed rods.The problem that I have with the DVD is that it is a compilation of several presentations from different instructors. As a result, there is a lot of overlap of material from one presentation to the next.The other gripe that I have is that when Lani Waller interviews the presenters, he asks of everyone, ""should single handed casters be intimidated by spey casting techniques?"" Its a good question, but it gets tiresome to hear 10 different people answer the same question."
5,Eastern styled rock at its best,"The Edges of Twilight is a hard rocking middle eastern styled cd. Hauntingly beautiful at times and hard rocking at others. The use of authentic middle eastern instruments enhances the sombre mood of the album and provides more depth than the traditional guitar, bass, and drums, and also highlights the incredible musicianship of the members."
2,good quality...bad desciption,Good quality hat but it is NOT adjustable. Desciption states it is adjustable but it is not there is a bit of strech in it but it should say strech fit.
2,ESL workbook,"I teach ESL and a friend had this book lying around and passed it on to me. Although some of the stories are interesting, others make one wonder, such as the story about dying and manners. Some of the follow-up questions about the ""Manners"" story are laughable. For instance, Question 2. When a lady's maid is working, her dress should be _________ (choice of colors); Question 4. At a very large party, how many dressing rooms should you have for your guests? My students live in a tiny apartment and can barely make ends meet. This is hardly the kind of information that is useful or interesting to them at this point in time. Some of the exercises are useful but some of the vocabulary is not. I use this book mainly for ideas and then rewrite and revamp to suit the needs of my students."
1,"Since when is the Democrat ""mascot"" an elephant?","This must be a real ""find"" since the elephant represents Republicans!"
4,"Really good book, also read sequel","I really enjoyed this book. After reading Gone With the Wind, I was craving a similar book. This was similar and turned out to be very enjoyable. I stayed up very late reading it, and finished it in a few days. If you read it, you must read the sequel, On Leaving Charleston. The book leaves off without a clear ending. The second one gives an explanation."
5,Charleston by Alexandra Ripley,"Great book about the City of Charleston SC and the people living in there during the Civil War. Not only a novel with a lot of history about the area but a great saga about how the Civil War affected the lives of the people of Charleston. The people of Charleston were a very proud and gracious people who's families had lived in the area for generations, the Civil War destroyed their homes and lives but not their spirit.There is a sequel to this book "" ON LEAVING CHARLESTON"" also by Alexander Ripley, which continues the saga of the people in the ""CHARLESTON""."
4,The girl's got some serious pipes.,I ran into Dana while having dinner at Don Cuco's one night and on a whim ordered this CD when I got home. I must say I was really impressed. The musicianship is excellent throughout. The writing is intelligent and interesting. The choruses have good hooks and I found myself humming one of the tunes in the shower the next morning.
1,Don't waste your time,"Characters are cookie cutter, the writing is poor and rather cheesy. Far too many cliches for my liking. The story certainly has potential, but this book was a colossal failure in my opinion. This is my first Barry Siegel novel and I hope that it is not an indication of his other works."
5,Asleep at the Wheel: Swing Time,"My husband brought this cd home and I was skeptical! Once he played it, the family fell in love singing the lyrics together. My parents came to visit and enjoyed it so much I gave them our only copy. Ever since the family has bugged me to buy another copy and that's why I am on-line today!"
3,Very Different,"Being a barrel racer I just had to buy this video. Not knowing what to expect, because there wasn't anything written here about it. On the back of the box it reads ""I wanted us all to remember the simple joy, beauty, ad spirit of barrel racing."" Well they show the good, the bad, and the ugly runs of the 98 Houston Livestock show all set the the music of the ""Nutcracker Suite"". There isn't any talking at all, just the music. Holiday borders are added around the screen, and plus some little special effects. It left me thinking, I wonder what her time was.....I do how ever appreciate Jane Weston for trying. There needs to be more exposure like this for barrel racing the growing sport that it is."
2,agree with last reviewer,"I downloaded the software to see how set up was and found that, while it is powerful software, it is a nightmare to set up. I don't want to learn programming (applescript) in order to have a business phone system. I want to buy a car, not a kit car with assembly (and some fabrication!) required! If you want to make a career out of setting up a voicemail system this software/hardware this appears to be the product for you! I have ordered a competing product, Phonevalet, and plan to write a review on that product. (they do not offer a download to take a look at the software but they do offer a 30 day moneyback guarantee) I hope this helps you."
1,"""Slow Ride"" is EDITED ONCE MORE!!!!","Once again, as I have stated in my previous reviews about 'Foghat The Essentials' and 'The Best of Foghat' this CD also only includes the short 3:30 version of Slow Ride. This is one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) songs in Rock-n-Roll history. The original album version is about 8:00 minutes long and it ROCKS!!! If you were counting on the long version on this CD, count it out. You'll want to purchase ""Fool for the City"" if you are looking for the long, original version of ""Slow Ride."""
4,"Great price, plenty of customization","We were looking for something to accomodate our new 42"" plasma tv. This was a great deal and was at the top of the list on Consumer Reports. It was also said to cost another $75-100. You can always find it cheaper on Amazon though. I set it up with the speaker that is self-configuring. Afterwards I did a litlle tweaking myself but not much. This has great dolby 5.1 and can even synth stereo surround sound to those not so great local channels too. All around a great buy."
4,Pass Through,Just make sure you understand this is hdmi passthrough. No sound will come through the speakers if u use hdmi cables. It literally passes through.Great otherwise.
4,Loved the shower scene,"While the movie was rather predictable, (blood, gore, killer) I really liked the actor that was in it. Michael Hurst made this movie come alive! :-) Its worth buying to see him in action. If you like Hercules:TLJ, this is a must see!! Desperate Remedies is another video to buy if you like Hurst. You can buy it at Amazon, too."
4,Nowt New but a Good One to Have Around,"Your standard compilation of quotes from the boys. Especially apt for the Manics considering Nicky's big mouth, wee Sean's bitter take on everything and James' frankness. Very few bands merit a collection of ""dumb-things-we-said-to-the-press"" book, but MSP do."
4,Very cool but LOUD,"I love this product, we saw one in our baby Dr.'s office and were mesmerized and finally found it here on Amazon (of course). It requires a little bit of work to mount it if you want it flush against the ceiling (the other option is to hang it from an already established ceiling hook). The reason I only gave it 4 stars is that it is pretty loud (it requires batteries to spin the hanging crystals), louder than I expected. Apparently there is a ""deluxe model"" that is not so loud and has a remote to turn it on and off but that was not made clear in the description. I would highly recommend the remote because you will not want this thing on all-night in a babies room especially."
2,a little disapointed,"I have them in other colors and like them, but I didn't like Twilight because the colors are a little dull. Also, the texture is not as good as I thought, it is too creamy. Despite that I still like the other ones I have. I think Revlon Beyond Natural Cream to Powder Shadows are better cream shadows and stay on better than this one. But remember: the Beyond Natural line is intended to look super natural, so you should consider that when deciding."
5,I'd recommend it!,"The charger combo for my mom's Samsung arrived quickly as usual throuh the mail. I can't remember if it was ups or usps, etc. Anyways, the chargers/cables worked great and the quality was decent enough for everyday use. I really dont have any complaints as of yet. I'd recommend this to anyone! ;)"
5,Steve,"These clamps are a must for the steel stud framers. You'll wonder how you ever did without after one day. A real time saver, made in America and warranty is great."
3,Oh what a relief,"I have chronic headaches and the Occipivot has helped with them. I love it when my masseuse massages my head and this has the same shape as her fingers. It is wonderful! I would have given it a higher rating, but I'm still trying to figure out the best way to use it. It tends to slip out of position on occasion. I would still recommend this product to others."
4,Provides some help for mid-back pain and improves posture..,"The thoracic pivot is a fairly good product, helps the mid-back muscles release. I noticed better posture after using it but go easy at first or you'll be sore the next day. I would recommend no more than 3-5 minutes at first till you see how it goes. The key to using any pivot device is to relax you muscles so if it's uncomfortable and you can't relax laying on the pivot move it around some."
2,not impressed,"I usually like Sennheiser products, but for the price of these earphones the sound isn't that good. Very poor bass. And the earbuds themselves don't fit comfortably in my ears. I like the style of the earbuds they use in their sport version of this, but the coiled cord in that is a pain."
2,Disappointing Tinny. Don't fit.,"I have had these for a few days and one gym workout. Compared to the stock iPod buds, the sound from the CX300's is tinny and lower. I also noticed that they distort at levels that are easily handled by the stock iPod buds.I have tried all three sizes of the cushions and none of them seem to provide a good noise seal or make the buds stay put. I also find that rounded shape makes them difficult to insert. When I try to push on the rounded end to seat them, they seem to go in the wrong direction.I would return them if I didn't already recycle the packaging."
2,"great sound, cord too short","I really want to like these headphones. I've had them for about six months and I think the sound quality is great for how much they cost. They're really comfortable, too.But the cord length on these things was definitely designed for someone who is wearing this on an armband or something. This is great, if you are one of those people. Unfortunately I'm not. The cord is so short that I can't have my mp3 player at my waist comfortably. That's kind of ridiculous! It does come with an extension cord, but when you have the extension cord on, it's way too long. A bunch of tangled cord in your pocket is not cool."
1,Much worse than E2C,"I already have an SE530 and an older E2C & Etymotic ER6 with frayed wiring. I bought these mostly to use in the gym. I was very disappointed with these, even though they only cost $20. The sound isolation is almost nonexistent, the sound quality is terrible, they're really uncomfortable and hard to put in my ears. I did't expect them to be as good as the expensive SE530, but they don't even compare to what you can get for $60-$80. These are unusable to me. I can't bear to hear my favorite songs destroyed by the horrible sound.I'm going to get a new SE110/115-K."
2,Poor durability,"When first purchasing these headphones I wrote a very glowing review. I like these because they sit right at the edge of the ear, it is not difficult to get a good seal, and they stay in. They don't quite have the clarity the higher end ones do, but I enjoy the sound as it is warm with plenty of bass. On top of that, they are cheap.However, I soon found out why they are so cheap. They don't hold up well at all. My first pair lasted a couple of months, until one of the ears stopped producing any sound. I returned it under warranty, and received a new pair. After a month, I had the same problem, and returned that pair. My third pair gave me small shocks in my ear, right after opening it from the box... sweet!"
2,Good sound quality...make sure to insert them correctly.,"I ordered these as a replacement for the earbuds which came with my Sansa hoping to get an improvement in sound quality. I was very disappointed at first because they had almost no bass. After playing around with them for a few days (and cussing a lot and writing a scathing review) I discovered that I had not inserted them properly in my ears. They should go into the ear canal until a seal is formed, almost like you're trying to seal out water. Then the bass kicks in. The sound quality was much better when properly inserted. Overall a big improvement over the stock Sansa buds. Should be 4 stars, but I can't edit the rating."
1,Disappointed,"I returned these because none of the various-sized earpieces fit my ears. However, I also was disappointed in the sound. Almost a metallic sound, poor bass. Even the iPod earbuds sound better. I have other Sennheiser products that are great, but these were not."
3,CX-300 Ear Buds,The wire is flimsy and will most likely wear out in a few months and I hate having one ear wire shorter than the other.
3,Great until you lose your ear bud covers,I loved these things but the problem is they aren't really that durable. The ear buds just keep popping off.
1,"earbuds sound fine, but poorly packaged and very unreliable","I like the sound of these earbuds, but they are very unreliable. One of the buds failed after only 30 days! Thankfully speedy-shipment (amazon marketplace) sent me a new pair, which they were not obligated to do, big props to them for that.Packaging also poor, just cardboard and plastic. Sony earbuds come with a nifty little custom case, Shure earbuds also come with a case. Lame!Update 11/2/08: Replacement earbuds failed after less than 3 months! Nasty!"
1,Believe the bad reviews,"I bought these on the recommendation of ConsumerReports. The buds sound good, not great. The real problem is that when you move, the wire makes a hum which is quite annoying. I returned these immediately. That is the absolute truth about the issue with these ear buds, and CR was plain wrong. Any good review for these would be from people who do not move with them on."
4,Great sound quality for the price; long-term cable quality is iffy,"This is my 2nd pair of these, and they sound GREAT for the price. My previous pair had the stiff rubber sleeves right by the earbuds detach after a couple years of use, but they still work fine otherwise (I use them primarily at work). I imagine the same thing will happen on the new pair eventually."
1,Disposable Earbuds - Don't Bother,"The sound quality is good, the external noise blocking is good, fit is decent, but durability is non-existent.After using these all of about 15 times or so, I noticed the sound had become muffled and weak in one of the earbuds. I sent them back to Sennheiser and they sent me a brand new pair under warranty no questions asked (thumbs up on their customer service).I took extra care with the replacement and handled them as delicately as possible, taking care to never pull on the wires, or bang them around or subject them to any other abuse. However, after a month of so of use, same problem as the first pair. Sound is dead in one earbud and muffled in the other.Stay away from these headphones. They sound good at first, but fall apart fairly quickly even when treated gingerly. This is a disposable product."
2,Not Worth It,"Overpriced and second rate. They will work well if you've never owned a decent pair of headphones before, but it's a stretch to say that they measure up against generic ipod/iphone buds - they can't lay a finger on similarly priced over-ears such as the Koss Porta Pro. Highs sound tinny, mid-range is weak, and the bass is over-done. In addition, there is a noticeable hiss any time they are plugged into a device. Save your money."
2,Good at first but it didn't last.,I bought these less than a year ago. The sound quality was quite good for my standards (I'm by no means an audiophile). Then the weather turned cold and every time I wore them outside I'd get little static shocks in my ears. This didn't happen if I was wearing them indoors. Now there is hardly any volume coming from the left bud. I was quite happy with these at first but now less then a year later I am very disappointed.
1,Returning - Right earphone is weak !,"I have been using V-Mode Vibe ( Gun Metal one ) for more than 2 years . I loved my V-Moda and now that its has wear and tear ( The Joints /Pins Ear buds , started loosing the isolation leading to some loose connection ) I wanted to try something else . I ordered this one , since it seemed to me good balance of price/quality . I really had a bad experience with this headphone. May be the one I got is faulty piece or so . The right channel is very weak and audio is imbalanced . I am returning it !"
2,You get what you pay for,"Much as I wanted to love these earbuds, they are more or less unwearable when you're walking anywhere. The cord is very nearly too short to tuck it underneath your shirt and then run it into your pocket, if there's any wind at all they create this obnoxious whistling noise when in your ear (like the wind makes when it's blowing really hard, except it doesn't need to blowing hard at all to make the noise in the earbuds), and the cord noise is almost unbearable unless you can keep it completely still and out of contact with any fabric. On the other hand, they're cheap and comfortable, and sitting still out of the wind (say on a bus) they do an ok job. Sound quality in situations like that is not bad, it's just when you get outside that it's absolutely wretched."
1,Defective!,"I give up. My 3rd pair of the exact same buds just died. Sennheiser does a great job of replacing them when they are under warranty (they did this for me twice), but these buds inevitably go bad. I won't buy them again."
1,dont buy from these guys.when its time to return they dont bother returning your emails.ill never buy from them again..,please dont buy from a1accessories they will keep your money and not return any of you emails when you need to return something..
3,The Sound of My Shirt,"As over 1000 reviews have already said, these earphones are a good value. They have great sound quality and feel comfortable in your ears.What other reviews haven't emphasized enough is this: CORD NOISE. I mean, wow, it's absolutely terrible. Some days, when I'm wearing them to study, I find myself taking them out and putting on Apple's crap earbuds just to get a break from the cord noise. For example, if you have these on, with the volume low (very low, like to study and block out ambient noise while listening to quiet piano etc) then you can literally hear your breathing moving the cord on your clothes louder than the music. And forget about eating or drinking with these in.When the volume is up loud, you never notice it and it's fine but if you listen to quiet music, DO NOT BUY THESE."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on Sennheiser,"After having the Sennheiser product for only a few weeks it developed a short near the headphone jack. The sound isolation is poor at best, and the sound is no better than the headphones that came for free with my player. The product was returned to Sennheiser for a warranty repair, but they refused to acknowledge the problem. Requests for explanations have been ignored."
4,Good value,Sound is great. Not a bad entry in the commodity level earbud market - very cost effective. My main negative is the use of a rubberized material covering the connecting wires. These wires are sticky and tend not to slide past each other easily and this promotes tangles in the wires that is annoying. Perhaps this will give the head set greater longevity but the tangled wires is a daily pain. The selection of several ear inserts assures a good ear fit and these earbuds are exceptionally good at muffling outside noise and isolating the sound. Great help on airplanes.
3,"Great headphones, missing case","I recently purchased these headphones and expected them to come with ""Dynamic Transducer Carrying Pouch Sennheiser Color - Black"" but they did not. Be careful of the source that is sending them out."
4,"Perform great, but could use some changes in design","Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black)These Buds sound great, have the bass fully covered and seem to be able to handle the power. I use them occasionally with various players, but I use more in studio and live stage monitoring systems (playing drums & bass) - the sound is great from high to low, the only cons are in physical design - the cord is too short; I prefer an evenly split cord design not the lopsided as these have; The stereo mini plug is a 90 degree plug - a straight plug would be better; And lastly the speaker bud could be just a tad lengthier. Yet they DO deliver in the perform department - They sound as good or better than any at 3X the price.I rate it 4 stars because performance and price is was important to me and these delivered."
5,Sennheiser Ear buds CX300-B,"The sound from these earbuds is excellent, I will be buying more of them as needed in the future. The price makes them an excellent value, too good to pass up."
2,The wires break easily,"Sound quality is good enough for the price.Isolation is okay, but not as good as Shures.Despite its good features, I cannot get over its problem- wires break VERY easily.Since these don't come with bags like the Shures, I couldn't keep them in perfect condition, but I certainly never abused them.Nevertheless, I've had wires break TWICE, and it seems to be a pattern; I also saw complaints online about this issue so I'm not alone.While cheap earphones are nice, I'd rather have one that lasts.Shures, although expensive, are completely worth the price difference for their superior isolation, better build quality, and the protective equipment that comes with it.So in conclusion, I will never buy Sennheiser's cheap earphones again."
1,Unusable unless sedated,"I'm shocked at the positive reviews on this product. I use my earbuds a lot on the treadmill or walking around. The material that lines the wire that goes from the jack to the earbuds is so stiff.....First off this means that any movement essentially causes the wires transmit the vibration to the earbuds. I constantly get a ""doink, doink"" noise when I use these. Also the right earbud wire is like 18 inches longer than the left. If you are committed to not moving one inch when using these they may be a good choice but......"
2,difficult,"Hard to keep these in your ears. Cable is ridiculously short, and the asymetrical L vs R cable lengths is very annoying."
3,Better that expected,I gave them to my son and he said they have lasted longer and worked better than he expected.
4,"Good ear-buds, great price","I bought mine more than two years ago. About two months ago one of the ear-buds broke, so I could only hear half the sound. All of a sudden three weeks ago the other one broke too, and it completely died.The durability is great, even compared to more expensive ones. I always have them on me, all the time. About six months ago, the jack started to fail. The wire got loose, but it stayed on though.The sound is good, the bass is great. My only complaint is that when you walk in wind, you constantly hear the wind noise and that really bugs me."
3,Not bad for the price,"I had Shure ear buds before but when I broke them I waned to get something a little less expensive to replace them. These sound great! I don't think they are good as the Shure buds but because they are lighter they stay in my ear much better making the sound consistent. With the Shure buds, I found myself constantly re-adjusting them in order to get the desired sound. The cord was so long and heavy the buds would work their way out of my ears.The only minus in my mind is the different length wires on the new ones. You have to run one of them behind your neck. Maybe some of you really like this but I wish they were the same length.All in all, I am very pleased."
4,Great for the price!,"I feel like these things pack some decent bass and sound quality in a little earbud. I was not overwhelmed by the quality of sound, but it is an improvement over cheaper earbuds."
1,Doesn't work,"These headphones were a disappointment. I bought them as a gift for my husband, but there was a wiring short and he couldn't get a clear sound through them. It just made a crackling noise, and in order to hear the music at all he had to hold them in a certain way. The sellers need a better method of testing their product."
1,Low end sennheiser in ear headphones,I've bought this one time and it broke on me while jogging. I sent it back for a replacement and it took a while. And then the right side stopped working. I just gave up on these headphones. I thought they were going to be good since it was made by sennheiser. boy was a wrong. sennheiser's cans are much better not the in-ear headphones like these. think twice before buying this one.
2,surprising wind noise,"Maybe I'm using the wrong size buds, but I get rather annoying wind noise with these whenever there is anything more than a slight breeze."
4,One of the best earbuds I used,"It's one of the best earbuds I used. But there is one pitfall-you can even hear yourself breathe with it in your ears. It kinda annoying. The rest of it are very satisfactory. My ears are the most picky ones because no matter what earbuds I used, they always tend to fall out of my ears. This doesn't have this kind of problem though. I've got a Sennheiser PX100 already and I really enjoy it! I love Sennheiser."
3,about average,"nice cans. nothing to rave about on my pair ... other than the artificial bass. sound muted to me. clarity is a problem. not sure what the hype is.i've used sennheiser HD595, ER-6, Shure Shure SE530, and others. listen from classic to heavy. a basic Yamaha RH-5Ma sound better.this is an okay replacement for the ipod, the artificial booms may be the incenitive."
4,Nice stuff!,"I like these headphones, but I wish they could do more to isolate the outside noises. These headphones on sale are a great buy for anyone looking to replace their crappy ipod headphones or any other garden variety crappy headphones with ones that are sensibly priced and do a good job of delivering the sound to your ears."
3,An okay deal for the price,"For the price, this is an ok deal. I bought it to replace my(stolen) Sony mdr-ex51.Liked: Sound quality was good for the price.Disliked: They don't block out as much outside noise, even with the different size ear cushions. Lots of sound transferred through the cord, so when your arm brushes the cord you hear it loudly. Had these for 2 years, and they recently stopped working - the right earbud lost most of its sound.Replaced with Sony mdr-ex90, more expensive but much better."
3,Short cord,"The sound quality is decent, but the cord length is a problem. It is just a few inches too short to have my phone in my pocket, so if I turn my head or lean back, the left earbud pulls out of my ear, ruining the sound quality and noise isolation."
2,Not worth the cheap price,"I've been buying Sennheiser products for about 13 years and have never been disappointed. Unfortunately, i can't say this any more after having used the CX300-B.The sound quality is pathetic: tinny verging on scratchy, weak weak bass, and very narrow range. I've compared the sound to a 15.99 sony set and this is far inferior. As an aside, cord length will be an issue if you like a little distance between you and your laptop/player. I realize these are cheaper than buds selling in the 70$ + range, but even at this price, it's extremely disappointing. I'm surprise Senn put their name on this. Bump up your budget and go with a set of v-moda or a higher range (Senn bud if there is one)."
1,This broke twice,"I liked the fit and price of these earphones, so I was stupid enough to buy another set after my first one broke. In my first pair, the wire split, making it impossible to hear out of one earbud, which I figured could be a fluke. Then, only TWO MONTHS into my second pair, one earbud has gone out again. There is no wire split and they look to be in good condition, but they're now useless.I'm very depressed that I can't find the original package in order to get my money back under warranty. I can only hope that no one will be stupid enough like me to pay for this product (twice)."
1,I guess you get what you pay for,"I would have returned these had I not thrown out the receipt...these don't work and I have researched to see if it was just mine but no, it's a common problem - one ear is louder than the other and there is nothing you can do about it. From the moment I turned my iPod on the left earbud was much quieter, to the point where it seems like nothing is coming out at all. Listening with one low and one loud sucks...it just makes you agitated...forget em, get the $30+ large headphones from Senheiser...they sound great and no volume disparity."
1,After 2 1/2 months--no sound in right earbud,"I'd just like to say beware of this product. I treated these headphones with good care, and after only 2 1/2 months the volume in the right earbud is nearly gone, while the left plays at normal volume, no matter what music player it's plugged into. I would really sadly hesitate to buy a Sennheiser product again."
3,"Best comfort at any price, great sound, lousy durability","These are the only earbuds I can wear for extended periods of time, without getting pain in my ears. The sound is also really good, especially considering the price.Unfortunately, I find myself having to order a new pair every two to four months, 'cause I lose sound in one of the buds.I also really dislike the asymmetrical cords."
4,Good and bad - a runner's perspective,"Got these to replace a pair that was dying. I listen mainly to audiobooks, mostly while running.Pro -Sound is goodBad -They fit snugly in the ear canal - rather than outer ear - so they will drown out other sound. Not ideal for runners who still want to be able to hear the environment.When running while wearing them, they reflect a constant swish-swish-swish sound which is extremely irritating. I'm not sure how exactly the phones are affected this way, but I will not be able to use these for running.Bottom line: They're fine for listening while stationary or walking, but if you're planning to use these while really moving, I'd get a pair that sits in the outer ear (i.e., standard ipod like headphones)."
3,Almost Impossible to open the package,"OK, but it's almost impossible to open the package. As with many consumer electronics. Am I missing something?"
3,Has both positives and negatives...,First of all I would like to say that the sound quality of these are great! I love the sound quality and the noise cancelling...I use them on the airplane and they work wonderful. BUT they do have a downside. I really hate the design of the cords were one is wayy longer than the other to wrap around the neck...terrible design. And they also only laster a year before one of the buds stopped outputting music. idk what to think...
4,Excellent for the price.,"Though not specifically ""ear isolation"" earphones, these are sufficient for office use, blocking PC fan and climate control ambient noise. The overall sound quality is strong, with decent separation and rich bass. The only thing I'd add would be a shirt/collar clip for the cord, to prevent vibration interference from the cable, as seen in the Etymotic ER-6i phones I use on planes."
4,Great sound from these headphones,"I own the Bose in-ear head phones with the i-phone mic/volume controls, It sounds fantastic. The CX300-B sounds almost just as great. If you like bass to your music or movies the CX300-B give very good bass. My coworker introduced these headphones to me and I was truly impressed. (the old version) I bought as a back-up pair of in-ear headphones for the gym. Very good sound, you'll be impressed."
3,"Good quality sound for the price, but design is an issue","When I can get the earbuds in my ear, the sound quality is good enough for me. Deep bass and ok highs and mids. The main problem I have with these earbuds is the cord. The right side is longer than the left side, which is really annoying for me as when I'm walking, my hand has a tendency to swipe the cord back and it pulls my left earbud out of my ear and it's a constant struggle to keep putting it back in. I have read online that they designed the cords this way to wear it around your neck, but when the wind blows the cord, or when I turn my head, one of the earbuds will pop out. It's really annoying as I spend most of my time adjusting the earbuds in my ear rather than listening to the music. I tried all three sizes of the earbuds they gave me and they all had the same problem. I can't jam the earbuds any further in my ear to make them more secure, so I guess you get what you pay for with this product."
4,Almost great in-ear headphones,"I bought these to add to my collection of headphones. I own the Creative EP-630's, which are similar to these and sound fantastic, but have a symmetrical cord and straight plug, both of which I don't really like. I figured these would sound similar if not better and also have the asymmetrical cord and 90 degree plug which I prefer.They do sound sound somewhat similar to the Creatives--they have punchy deep bass and clear sound, but the frequency balance is quite a bit different. The Sennheisers have more prominent highs than the Creatives, and while this makes them initially sound exciting, I find that I get tired of listening to them sooner than I do the EP-630's.Don't get me wrong--I do like the sound of these, but I like the Creatives just a bit better. I do, however, like the cord on the CX-300s better."
3,The cord sucks!!!,I bought these a week ago on Amazon. [...]. I had been using the stock Apple earbuds with my iPod. I wanted to upgrade. I use my iPod daily at the gym. They sound great WHEN they stay in place. The design of the cord is rediculasly stupid. [...]. Due to this major flaw they only get 3 stars from me. The problem is that the left ear phone holds all the weight of the entire cord. This causes it to constantly loose its snugness. As you may know that without the earphone fitting snug it looses all bass. Add in the fact that while working out your moving around alot and sweaty. Ill get some use out of these and move on. Had I known how the cord was I wouldnt have tried these even if they were free. They are probably decent for some one using them on an airplane. I am definetly bummed out with this purchase.
2,Bad Design for Working Out,"These headphones are impossible for me to wear while working out. They fall out of my ears constantly and the two different cord lengths for the ear buds are annoying. One ear bud basically supports all the weight of the cord from your one ear, causing it to easily fall out. You can also hear the motion of the cord if it brushes against your clothing. The sound quality isn't too bad, but I hate the design."
5,Great Headphones!!!,"I bought these headphones on October 2009 and they broke last week! So these buds are definitely durable! The only small problem I have with them is that they get tangled easily. Sound quality is great (used them to work out, on noisy bus and walking to class), overall great bang for your buck."
5,amazing sound !,"All I have to say is that if you buy these earbuds you will not be disappointed. The sound quality is fantastic and the bass is really exceptional , just as advertised. I listen to rock music so I cannot vouch for other types of music like hip hop but I'm sure that any music would sound great on them. I like these so much, that even though I have some high quality speakers on 2 different sound systems in my house I still prefer to listen to music on these bad boys. They take music to a whole 'nother level."
2,Man I hoped for big! Not...,"I saw these Hp's and was really excited about the features and sound quality. However, to my dismay, the bass flattens out and the confounded contraption fizzles out at max volume (how can i listed to Pac w/out bass!) The cords were about 2in. to short for a man that is 6 ""1, if you are my height please beware, you will constantly pull at the cords and have distortion with your sound. Well besides that the longer right ear cord is kind of nice, but overall i prefer the classic style. The Hp's look great, but really, at this day and age that's all you can do is make them look good...C'mon."
2,Asymmetrical length of earphone cords annoying,I bought this product because of the ability to change the size of the earbuds. I hadn't realized that the cords to the earbuds were of drastically different sizes. I clip my MP3 player to the waist of my shorts when I run and put the cord inside my shirt. I do not put it on my arm which is apparently what the product's designers assume. The short earbud kept falling out because it had no slack. I had to stop using them because it was so annoying.
1,Left ear bud arrived defective,"The reason why I gave ""Durability"" a one-star is because the earphones arrived defective. I can't hear anything out of the left ear bud and am in the process of returning them hopefully for a new pair. It's a shame because they were my friend's going away present and he tried them out and they wouldn't work! The music sounds great in the ear bud that does work."
4,For the money,"they're fine. I couldn't see spending the original price of $50+, but for under $30 these do the trick. The sound is a rather muffled, not nearly and clear and I'd prefer and many will complain about getting them to sit right and stay in your, but, for the price you can't complain too loudly.I prefer more clarity and attenuation, so I'm still on the look out for a better IEM."
3,loud but noisy!!,"I have been using earbuds for decades, and after reading so many reviews on the cx300 I decided to ""upgrade"" from my old sonys.like the product description says, it is bass driven, and it is significant louder than many other sound isolating earbuds around the same price range. What I didn't like was the noise level on these earbuds are very high. If you have a pair of trained ears you should be able to hear the noise once you plug it in and power on whatever the device you're using. Without the hitting the play button you should hear some background noise.Overall it sounds bass heavy and you are losing most of the mid-high frequencies. Not quite what I expected from Sennheiser."
1,Junk...,"Just like my Samsung Blackjack, one week after the one year warranty is up, tada, they break! One side of the earphones just stopped working. My Sonys, on the other hand, have been going strong for about 3 years. Sound quality leaves a lot to be desired too."
2,"Weak sound, no bass, cheaply made","After reading all the great reviews of these headphones, I thought that I couldn't go wrong. But, I was mistaken. These headphones sound very tinny, and have almost no bass. My apple headphones that came with my iphone are much much better, which was a surprise. The sound isolation is decent, but the sound quality is poor. But, that is what you get for $20. If you are looking for better headphones than apple includes, look elsewhere! These are cheaper, in every regard. The cable is very flimsy and thin. The whole package feels cheap, which it is. I feel like the cheap sony headphones you can buy at Target for $15 are better than these."
2,Started malfunctioning after 3 months...,"When these are working, they work well. They appeared to be very sturdy. The wires, in fact, seemed a bit thick and tended to retain their shape, standing at strange angles instead of draping down. I used them daily for three months, at which point the contact at the audio plug went bad and the signal to one of the buds began cutting out."
1,very disappointed,"Cheap, whimpy sound. I guess that should be expected. However, I expected more from Sennheiser. Worse than the headphones that came with my iPhone. I will keep them as a spar, but really disappointed."
3,Overly Hyped Product,"I bought this pair of CX300 from Amazon after seeing people praise how awesome it is. Even though I'm no audio enthusiast, I'm not quite satisfied with what it delivers.The bass to mid-range part is very fuzzy, and you have to use the ""treble-boost"" equalizer on your iPod to really get some clear upper-range sound. The only way to reduce the fuzziness is to use ""bass-reduction"" EQ, which just makes the ""Bass-driven sound"" feature pointless.And like many other in-ear earbuds, CX300 is not suitable for walking around or riding your bike. The winds and cord movements make pretty noticeable noises.Overall I don't think it's quite worth the price even if it's considered a ""cheap"" headset."
3,"Legit, but flawed","I like these headphone overall, the price point is fantastic but they have their flaws. I'd say you get what you pay for with these.After seeing that these were Amazon's best selling headphones and reading the reviews I was very excited to buy these. However, when I first used them I was left thoroughly unimpressed. Over time, these have gradually grown on me and I am less disappointed. They are undoubtedly solid for sitting and casual listening and the sound quality is great. However my primary use for them is jogging. It took a while to find a good fit in the earbuds, but even now that I have a solid fit I find I have to constantly readjust them while running. Worst of all is the quality of the sound while running. Frankly it is unacceptable. The wind whistles through them and the cable noise is very loud. But I will accept blame for that choice, these are not supposed to be used for athletic activities anyway I assume."
3,"Great isolation, but broke after a few months","I loved these headphones the sound was great as was the isolation (I couldn't hear anything other than my music), but then they broke after 6 months. I'm still giving them 3 stars for quality of sound and they're not very expensive."
1,Not for the iPhone!,"Despite many claims that these earbuds are for use with the iPhone (even in many of the reviews you see here), they DO NOT HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE. This renders them virtually useless for the iPhone. Sure, you can listen to music through them, but what's the point if you can no longer take a call or have any of the other functions of the iPhone requiring a microphone. No products should carry the label ""for use with the iPhone"" (which is also right on the product packaging)if they are not fully functional for the iPhone!I'll have to give these to my kids who use iPods and keep looking for a reasonably priced set of earbuds...but with the microphone this time!"
4,Decent Product with minor issues!,The price and noise cancellation is the top attributes of this product. Flimsy construction regarding the wiring and one bud longer then the other is what is wrong with this particular model.If you move around you can hear a squishing sound so you have to be stationary when your using this product. Considering the price I found this product very useful and handy when pairing it with a laptop or a netbook.
5,Very good headphones,"These are excellent headphones. I got them through an Amazon sale $17, which is a steal. These headphones come with 3 different size pads to fit any ear. Normal, hard plastic ear buds hurt my ears, but the middle size of these fits snuggly and fine. They block out small amounts of sound, and have great sound quality, including a pretty good bass range if oriented in your ear properly. The cord is fairly short and may pull the buds out if your mp3 player is in a deep pocket and you jump or something, but stay calm for don't put your mp3 player so far away and it is fine. The cord is sticky rubber, but I like it. They are all black and look pretty stylish. Overall, no issues and a great product. Buy a pair!"
4,Not what I wanted...,"This is a great product. Its basically what you would expect from a pair of $20 headphones. Not Bose quality, but also not the crap that they send you with your I-pod. The only problem is that somehow I got the impression that these were 2.5mm headphones. The kind that you would use in a phone. If you are buying these for any regular 3.5mm device (i pod, I phone, laptops, portable dvd players, really about anything with a headphone jack) the headphones are a great product for the money."
1,Okay headphones but...,"Horrible durability! Right earphone broke down and stopped working after just over a month! Showed signs of breaking after half a month, where the sounds sometimes were very discreetly muted in the right earphone. paid over 40 dollars for these earphones, thought I was getting something good.What a ripoff...will send the company an e-mail, I'd be horribly disappointed if I don't get a refund or replacement or at least some kind of reimbursement.And aside from the breaking down, the bass is too strong, the sound quality is average at best..."
1,Totally Worthless,"""Bass-driven sound"" is far from true. These headphones have a horribly tinny sound; the earbuds that came with my iPod have better sound than these. This came as a big surprise for me because I have owned two pairs of Sennheiser headphones and have always used Sennheiser as a reference point for good sound. In addition, the wires on these earbuds are so thin that I'm sure I won't have to tolerate the sound for more than a few months. The next time I will just buy a pair of Apple earbuds.These earbuds are a huge disappointment. I would not recommend them to anyone for any reason. I've now had them for 6 months and have bought a pair of Apple earbuds to replace them. The earbuds are more comfortable and have much better sound quality."
2,Beware,"This product comes with a two-year warranty on the ORIGINAL purchase only. The original headphones broke after about 18 months, and the replacement pair broke after only 8 months. Because more than 2 year passed since the original purchase, Sennheiser refused any repair, discount, or replacement of any kind. As my tech savvy friend warned me: ""Those Sennheisers are cheapie $10 headphones with a $30 logo, FYI."""
3,Great.... but don't last,"When you pull them out of its box they sound great. Good bass,comfortable, and they stay in your ear. I loved this product. But when you turn sound up they don't last long at all. I let my friend borrow my headphones (who listens louder than I do) and the next thing he knows is that he can only hear the music in his right ear. So I ordered new ones, and only 6 months later the same thing happened. If they didn't break (twice) they would be 5 stars. I only recommend this product if you listen quietly."
2,Another One Bites the Dust......,"In my five year search for a pair of ear buds that I can use daily that will last longer than 1 year, the Sennheiser CX300 fell short. About six months have passed and one ear bud does not work unless I twist the cord at the plug point. The ear buds are under warranty, but I have to pay for shipping and they recommend I pay for another pair when I ship my current broken pair to them, ha! Another great thing is it is up to them weather they send me a refurbished pair or not, wow. I love my other Sennheiser headphones, but these ear buds lack durability. While they worked the sound was good I will say."
2,nice head phones unless you run,I purchased these headphones because they were suppose to have good sound quality and it looked like the earbuds would stay in my ears when I run. The sound quality was great until I started sweating and then they started to shock my ears. At first I thought I was crazy since this had never occurred before with any headphone but no it was not a hallucination but a reality. Since I purchased these to use basically when I run I had to return them for obvious reasons.
2,unusable,I just buy this product and feel very disappointed. The sound is good but the noise on the line will completely goes to your ear and you can not even touch the line.
3,Bought Two Both broke,"I initially liked these earphones, great sound but they are not durable, the right side stops wotrking after sometime, I bought a pair and it went out of order in a year second one lasted less than a year. I called the company for the information and they said that it will cost more than the the new items price to get it repaired. I will not buy it again, twice bitten"
3,"Good, Not Great","For the money, this is a good product. As with other reviewers, I do not like the asymmetrical cable lengths. I have found that cord noise is noticeable, quite so at times. The sound quality is good to very good, but to me, not great. The fit and finish is very good and it seems with proper care they should last a long time. However, when it is time to look for another set I will definitely try another product before buying these again."
4,Ear buds,The ear buds are comfortable but as a runner they can slip out at times. It does have very good sound quality
4,Happy with fit and sound,"I'm pretty happy with the headphones, as many others have written before me. Fit is very nice, the rubber is nice and soft and do not come off at all. Perfect compliment to my Sony S-Series MP3 player."
4,A well written Vampire Romance,Vampire stories always fascinate me. A good and well written vampire romantic story.Finished the book in 2 days...kept me interesting throughout.
3,"Okay looking, less than ideal clamps.","The description claims the product can fit 1.75 - 2.5"" pipes. This is true for the tip itself, however the clamps only allow for a 2"" max pipe size. I attempted to mount these on 2.25"" pipes and was forced to buy longer stainless steels screws. Be aware the clamps will not work on curved portions of existing tail pipe. Preferably the existing pipe should be straight for 6-7"" inches before a bend, otherwise the Tip might protrude out further than desired."
1,disappointing,"You would think that a video that focused on emotional intelligence would be interesting and take advantage of its own information! This was incredibly boring and disappointing. It was mostly straight lecture followed with some shallow attempts at describing model programs. A complete waste of money. I am kicking myself for spending as much as I did on it. I love that book, I love the authors ideas, but this video could have been much better. And for the price, the audio could be clearer."
1,"Defective, poor video & sound","Player was defective on receipt, only played intermittently. When it did play, the sound and picture quality were poor. The 7 inch screen is just too small to be functional, I suggest spending the extra $150-200 and getting a larger screen and higher quality player."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Alien parasite problem.The protagonist here is a cop. She is sent to a world to try and keep the lid on a situation between humans, the local inhabitants, and a powerful alien race. This is definitely harder than it seems. When she meets an alien with some very unusual characteristics she gets a lot deeper in than she ever wanted to, and ends up in a position a little similar to F. Paul Wilson's healer."
3,Sonc Blade,Purchased my first one of these several years ago for nearly $50. Purchased an additional one in new condition on ebay for about $11 a couple of years ago because I needed a new battery . Decent product but the weaknesses have to be the power switch and (of course) battery life.
3,Adult Training Coordinator,"I love the blades and it seems to work well. My only problem has been keeping the battery charged. I have to check my paperwork to see if I should leave the battery in the charger all the time. That would help, then it would be ready to go when I need it and maybe stay charged up to do the complete job."
1,dead battery,"This was actually the second Sonic Knife we purchased. The first one lasted 3 years and the battery died. Could not find a replacement battery, so we bought a new knife. The first time we used the new knife the battery died. It was a hastle trying to get a replacement, so after much frustration we sent the knife back."
1,"Bulky, Heavy, Poor Battery Life","See the regular price on this knife? That's what I paid for it some years ago. It was so heavy and bulky, it spent the next many years in a drawer. I got it back out a month ago, used it a couple of times, remembered why I put it in the drawer in the first place, and pitched it in the trash."
3,not to pleased,"I purchased a knife from QVC awhile ago.Long story short I had to get a new one .The battery wasn't charging.QVC didn't have them any more.I threw it out. Had it awhile.Then I found yours.Made sure it was a new one.Which it said it was. (hope it was)Purchased it. Follow directions.Charged it for 10 hrs. like it said.Went to use it and it fizzed out.BUT, when I just pressed the button it worked.Go to cut meat and it didn'tQuestion: Was it new liked it said.And can I replace the battery.Will the battery cost me more than the knife.Thankyou,Marie Maurer"
1,short operating time,This unit came with two different blades but its biggest drawback is the operating time you get on a full battery charge. While slicing a prime rib roast on Christmas Day I was only able to get three slices before it died.
1,It SUCKS,"I have had my little wonder knife for about a year. I have finally found a use for it, since it would not carve a chicken, let alone a turkey. I had 6 seat cushions to cut out of 2.5 inch foam for redoing my dining rooms chairs. The foam almost won. This knife does nothing in your kitchen that they show on any infomercial. The battery is useless, the blades have plastic parts that fall right off, the charging stand is just a waste of counter space. A cordless knife is a great idea, maybe I should write Makita or Milwaukee to make one, as they seem to have the battery life issue solved with tools that cut concrete. Avoid this travesty of a kitchen appliance at all costs."
1,Don't waste your money,It cut. Basically saws its way through what it will cut. Will not cut through a head of cabbage or a pineapple it also cuts at an angle so you have to guide It in the opposite direction. It's also very akward to operate just pulling the trigger is tricky. The really bad part is that it died in 3 months. It's probably in the local landfill with all the rest of them. Tried to recycle it no one would take it.
2,BATTERY WONT HOLD A CHARGE,I love the convince of having a portable power knife (I have an old Sonic Blade and the battery has given up after nearly a year of heavy use )I have charged the battery that came with my purchase (from Amazon) for more than 24 hours and it will not hold a charge.
1,Battery has never worked,"I received this knife as a gift and have tried charging the battery many times. It simply doesn't charge at all, so the knife has never been used. Buying a new knife would be less expensive than buying the battery but why bother?"
3,"Good blades, possible battery problem","The blades are really great, like the ones on my first sonic blade. And the cost was so much reduced over my first purchase a few years ago. The battery does not seem to hold a long charge and needs to be recharged much more frequently than my first purchase. And I did follow the initial charging instructions too."
1,The Sonic Blade is useless,"After 2 days the battery would only charge enough to take off 3 slices off a 4 lb pork roast. I did not look at the return policy of Discount Jungle until a week ago and realized it was 30 days from purchase date which means you would only really have less than 20 days due to shipping time from Amazon and the time to supposedly charge the knife. There is also a 15% re-stocking fee. As a result I was past the time to return it. I would have purchased a replacement battery but they are non-existent. If you want to throw away $ 37.95, this is your product."
1,Sonic Blade 7865.00 Cordless Rechargeable Knife,poor battery life & won't really cut thru anything very well.Those butt wait commericals really sucked me in!Plus I can't seem to find replacement batteries either.Good will is getting another item from me.
1,Do Not Do Not Do NOT!!!!!!,"I ordered the last year 12/31/07...said it would take 6 weeks.......!!!! TOOK MY MONEY NEVER RECEIVED, STILL TO DAY NEVER GOT MONEY BACK!!!! LEARNED A BIG LESSON...NEVER...NEVER ORDER LIKE THAT AGAIN....I READ SMALL PRINT...I UNDERSAND EVERTTHING THEY SAY ABOUT BEING CHAARGED LATER,.... BUT YOU HAVE TO RECEIVE... DO NOT BUY!!!!WAIT TO BUY IN THE STORE...NOT THAT GREAT NOOOOO STARSSSS AT ALL. THE ONLY WAY I CAN REVIEW THIS STUPID THINGS IS TO GIVE IT ONE STAR....NOT...NO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not worth getting yet,most pvp's aren't worth getting yet either. they don't have the best support and they are too exspensive. if you have a lot of money to waste get this. mp3 players are still cheaper and practical. if you want more than a mp3 player get the photo viewing iriver h10 If this was cheaper people would actually look at them. still a lot of peolpe don't have compatible pc's with them. if a few years passed pvp's would be worth getting by then they would be smaller and not heavey as bricks creative makes a great zen micro too.
5,A Dark Beauty,"This album is like a dark but beautiful dream. Just close your eyes and the classical style music, that draws it's feel from an old mummy movie, will send shivers down your spine. It's story is dark drawing your imagination to creatures from beyond our world, seeking a way back to power and control over your mind. If you ever loved the eerie music of a good horror movie then you'll love this album."
5,"Behold, the stars are as one...","Impressive musickal accompanyment serving as a fitting tribute to H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Magnificenty dark and brooding, narrations and incantations enhance this sonic novel as the lavishly decorated booklet serves as a veritable playlist, as phantasmagoric visions manifest in the shadows of your mind. They are as 'real' as you wish them to be...A decidedly Middle-Eastern influence is noticable here, with sporadic sounds of sitars and finger cymbals join to create a serpantine embience reminiscent of an ancient temple. The prime Alla Xuls Yog-Sothoth, Azathoth, Nyarlathotep, Dagon, and of course, Cthulhu are specifically addressed, with character descriptions of each. [sans Shub-Niggurath...]Suspend disbelief and open the gates of the swirling abyss when the CD case is unsealed and The Old Ones call up from the depths."
3,Interesting view of the human element of Berlin Airlift.,"Putting aside the love story at its center, this film provides a timely view of the Berlin Airlift. Film was shot on location in Germany during or shortly after the Berlin Airlift (June '48-Jul '49). The film accurately documents Airlift operations, including the hazards crews faced (harressment from Soviet fighters, bad weather), and innovations (such as Precision Approach Radar) employed to make the airlift successful. Having lived in Germany, I think the film also presents a revealing and truthful insight into the human side of the airlift, to include living conditions and beliefs in post-war Berlin. The attitudes and philosophies expressed by the four main characters and their associates are representative of the era. Overall, this film has good flying scenes and a good human interest plot."
3,Oh No-Oh Candy!,"This poor reproduction of some classics is released by Sony.Please put the hand claps back in ""Oh Candy""!"
3,Cheap Trick - 'Don't Be Cruel' (Sony Music Special Product),"A second-rate ten track compilation. Don't let the cover mislead you, as this isn't a live CD as I first assumed it might be. Sound quality isn't perfect,but acceptable. Cuts I sort of took notice of(a few that I haven't heard in awhile)were ""Surrender"", their beloved Elvis cover title track ""Don't Be Cruel"", ""ELO Kiddies"" and ""Oh,Candy"". Pretty much for all you die-hards."
4,What a cat!,"Good time old ""screwball comedy"". If you like cats and baseball, this film is for you! (And a happy ending to boot.) I set up a large projection screen and video projector in my in-law's living room on New Year's Eve to view this movie. It was a great way to see in 2012."
1,DOESNT EVEN DESERVE A 1 STAR RATING,"THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR A RODEO VIDEO IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. I WAS EXPECTING THE BEST OF THE BEST AND TO MY DISMAY, WAS DISAPPOINTED AND DISGUSTED BY WHAT THEY PERCEIVED AS THE BEST. IT DOES NOT LIVE UP TO ALL THE HYPE IT RECEIVED AND THE PEOPLE AND COMPANY WHO PUT THIS TOGETHER SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED."
4,A playful and useable satire on D&D.,"Nuisances is a wonderfully written book, with a great amount of information about things you didn't know and probably are better off not knowing about the world of D&D. Whether it's regarding the multiple tables you can use, or the prestige class ""Prostitute"", you are bound to find somthing laughable or usable."
3,Its Pretty OK,"This is a good solid album. The only issue is that when I think of Bad Brains, I want Rock FOr Light or the ROir tapes. They are far more raw and wreckless. This album is really pretty good, but its a bit more on the heavy metal side of things. One good novelty highlight is the song, ""Sacred Love"", where HR sang the lyrics over the phone from jail. Its worth buying, but not as a first Bad Brains cd. Pick up the Roir one instead."
4,Creepy and Cool,This movie is creepy and cool. One of the best Frankenstein adaptations yet! Actors are solid and the effects are really good. The story is told with flashbacks (like the book) and there are some interesting twists that I wasn't expecting. Definitely an above average horror flick.
5,MP's third album almost as classic as their second,"Another fine album by the Meat Puppets out of the early '80s. After their fantastic MP II they released ""Up On The Sun"". I liked it then, and I still like it today.Less raw than MP II and more produced, it has an almost REM ""Murmur"" feel to it. While MP II was hardcore meets country, ""Up On The Sun"" is firmly in the alternative camp.SST released so many great albums in the early-mid 80's from Black Flag to the Minutemen and the Meat Puppets. While MP II remains my favorite album it only beats ""Up On The Sun"" by a hair.Great album from a great era."
3,Not bad,"Nice job from Tony, but Prechter lacks deeper knowledge of the basics of finance and macro-economy to be able to make such affirmations. Not to mention that he over-simplifies all matters to make and re-make his point. Of course, his pessimistic view may still prove to be right and then he will be called a guru again. But how long has been since he declared these points and nothing happened? Some months, right? As he also agrees, TIMING is key to make or not to lose money on financial markets, so to me this book is 3 stars: not bad, but no good either."
4,Soup's On!,"I am a huge fan of soup...it can be a simple, stand-alone dish or an elegant addition to a 5 course meal. I picked up this book to find some new ideas to make soup, and I have come away with some great offerings.Some of my favorites include: Cream of Broccoli (it never tastes good unless homemade!), Potato and Celeriac, Creamy Vegetable, Mushroom, Barley & Leek, Hunter's Soup, Spicy Black Bean, Pasta e Fagioli, Three Bean, Beef Chili with Beer, Curried Chicken Stew, and Cocoa Cookies. The book includes sections on salad dressings, breads, and sweets to go along with your homemade soup.The only improvements that could be made with this book would be to add color photographs of the dishes, and a spiral binding so that it could lay flat. Otherwise, the recipes are delicious and offer a great variety. Enjoy!"
1,Great Film but Bad DVD by Legend House! Buy the Code Red version as Terror Circus.,Note my original negative review was for the bootleg release by Legend House as it was an unlicensed release that appears to come from a VHS duped and thus it looks awful so don't waste your money on it. However do buy the official version by Code Red under the TERROR CIRCUS title this one gets 5 stars. Not sure why this negative review was attached to Code Red's product page which hadn't come out when I wrote this review.
4,I BELIVE THAT THIS BOOK IS OUTSTANDING .,The reason why is I have several of these dogs myself and I love the way they are around kids. We started out with 1 and now we have 10. The books I have read have a lot of intresting thjngs in them.
1,Item pictured is not what SleekHair sends! And they don't care!,"I love this product, but the item pictured is the bottle type and SleekHair ""Slick Willies"" the money from you with their product misrepresentation and sends you the jar type instead! Even after you tell them in emails not to! Their refunds policy leaves you with less money in your wallet and no product! They charge you a 20% restocking fee for their screw-up (or in my case, they defiantly sent the jar type after I told them that was not what I wanted!), you don't get your shipping and handling refunded and the postage for you to send back to them with signature confirmation as they advise is very pricey! And they get to sell the product again to another unsuspecting customer! They seem to be randomly abusing their customers as many customers have complained as I have. If you have $30 or so to just throw out the window then by all means, go ahead and order from these crooks!"
5,"Man, hide your neck!","This game was Fantastic! I bought the first one and even though I loved the puzzles, I was disappointed that I breezed through it in only 2 days. Then I got this one...OMG! Talk about running out of the room. Everytime I heard a ""growl"", that was my que to leave the room and gather myself. LOL! The puzzles were fantasic. The graphics were absolutely realistic. The 360 degree movement was perfect for this game. It allowed you to look everywhere~up especially without moving. (Very helpful)The characters,puzzles, places...and the feelings..all of it..I give it a big thumbs-up!!! Hope there is a third one."
4,"drop the hat, get the record","If you dig Ginn it's a no-brainer. Sick, dissonant, all-over-the-place guitar is complimented by extra tight rhythm section (Cain/Weiss). Screwy instrumental rock that's more together than Flag's ""..Weeding Out"" album. Easily some of the most perverted riffs ever invented by Ginn, which is saying something. I don't know of more than 4 people besides myself that flip for this album."
3,Winnepeg rocks,"This is a young band with a big concept sound, kind of a mix of Big Country, Linkin Park and Genesis, if that makes any sense. Generally speaking their instincts for music are pretty good, song passages for the most part are pleasing, and that's a very good thing. Where they fall down is trying too hard to be dramatic, like all the time. The beat gets too frenetic in places, and the vocals go right to climax and stay there, leaving no place for the song to peak. If they took a deep breath, turned down the adrenalin just a bit and focused on being more melodic, I think they could go places, a lot of the right parts are there."
2,Men With Brooms,"Sorry, didn't realize it was ""R"" rated when ordered. The story line was good but the additions of ""sexual parts"" I quess to make R - took away from the movie. I'm not keeping.Men With Brooms"
3,what a strange sport,"Mostly interesting for the novelty of curling, which I knew nothing about before watching this movie. It had some funny parts, but I only got it because I have a crush on Paul Gross, and Slings and Arrows is a lot funnier. Not a bad movie, not a great movie."
4,Does anyone have a Widescreen Dvd that plays Fullscreen???,I do!got one from canada a year and a half ago...had a friend going up and he got it for me!.....packaging says Widescreen!.....the DVD says Widescreen!SOB!!!!!!!!it only plays FULLSCREEN!!!!!!!!!and I can't find anything on it to change it over!I hate the Credits chopped off on the sides and some of the shots!....well one of the 4 guys sitting on the Ice....Paul is on the far left....he's totally missing on the fullscreen version!I've tried writing Alliance Atlantis 4 times to No Avail!andI really dread having to buy another one!who knows might get stuck again!Please can anyone help me out here!
3,English type movie about... curling!!,"Some of you might not even know what curling is, but it is big in Canada and some northern European countries. The object is to slide big stones over ice to some kind of bulls eye... Just wait for the next winter Olympics!This story is about a great team that had to split up after the captain cheated. Ten years later their coach has died and in his will asks them to once more try and win the title.'Men with brooms' feels like some of the great comedies from Brittain in the last 10 years like 'The Full Monty', 'Billy Elliot' and 'Bend it like Beckham'. The characters are down-to-earth but have a comic twist. Some running gags like trying to get pregnant are also hilarious, especially because the guy is the biggest dork around.It's fun, maybe not worth the price though. Oh yeah, Leslie Nielsen (Naked Gun) also plays in this movie and is funny."
2,Bland and misinformative,"I am not a fan of this ""cashing in on my old bands success"" formula. My favorite part of this book was going through it and picking out all the mistakes Bob Brunning made...there are numerous typing errors and even more information that is just not correct! The pictures aren't anything you haven't seen before...boring!"
2,not impressed,"This case cannot be used with the toshiba FM transmitter, and it never mentions that. (I dont know if it can be used with any transmitter). other than that it is ok."
2,Too flimsy,Don't buy this if u want a jacket that will support the zune firmly to your arm without bouncing around. It seems like it can rip easily too.
4,Wonderful Product,All I can really say is that this is a wonderful product. Detailed instructions about how to put the armband through the sleeve would've been nice but I figured it out after about five minutes. I suggest it to anyone as a cheaper alternative to protecting the outside of your Zune effectively while still giving you access to every button.
5,Baptist Faith Book,"Written from speeches at the fundamental Baptist Congress of North America and recorded in this book. Immortal Baptist Preachers, teachers, and authors of our time. 1963"
1,NICE SCARF BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"I bought this scarf as a gift and it's nice but not worth the price. Go to LA, have some fun and get it for cheaper at the outlet stores."
2,DTroppens,"Honestly, I found the book rather mediocre. With books like this, I love to just pop open to a page and read that chapter for that moment. With this book I never found myself that wowed. There are better books concerning the Detroit Tigers out there."
5,the economic way of thinking,Very easy to read. I had little problem reading and understandnding very informative would recommend this book for anybody taking a economics class.
2,Not Worth Spending the Money,"I am a huge fan of Amy Singer's online knitting magazine, [...]. For someone who spends time on the web site, the book is unnecessary. If there are one or two items in the book not on the web site, just borrow the book from your local library for the time it takes you to knit it."
5,An outstanding book for the non-archaeologist,I purchased this book on a visit to Williamsburg and it sat on my shelf for quite a while before I seriously dove in. This book combines a clear explaination of archaeological methods with the building suspense of a good detective novel. As The author and his team uncover the existence of an early Virginia colony and utilize an astounding range of techniques and research to slowly piece together the lives of the inhabitants you will be drawn into the past. More than that you will be excited to read on and discover with these archaeologists what really happened. I.N. Hume writes eloquently on all aspects of organizing and proceeding with a project of this scale and mixes those details regarding administration and method with the fascinating story of the settlement of Martin's Hundred flawlessly. I could not imagine a better introduction to the discipline of archaeology for the layperson.
1,Not a good option,"I bought one, returned it because it didn't work, replaced it, the new one didn't work, so I said forget it.I did everything the instructions said, but there was no communication from my computer to the player, so after 2 flaws, I have very little trust for this brand.Save up and get a good one."
2,Gets the job done...,"This is a great mp3 if you like about 50 songs and don't mind searching through all fifty to find the one you're looking for.ProsSmall and compactLow priceExcellent random functionGood sound qualityDurable headphonesEasy to transfer and delete songsOption to insert memory cardConsSpontaneous stopping and shutting downFreezing, causing need to take battery in and outNo playlist organization whatsoeverAnnoying song that comes with the mp3 and is difficult to removeBatteries don't last longer after using mp3 for several monthsArmband and case look like you're trying to take your blood pressureDoesn't hold many songsNo radio functionNo warrantySo, in short, this is an excellent mp3 if you don't mind having to guess what songs you'll want to hear and don't care about the order."
4,fun but challenging,"We recently purchased this playset for my dino obsessed 3 yr old. He loves it and plays with it constantly. BUT the orange supports for the temple are unnecessarily challenging, requiring the precise alignment of two grooved pieces in order to fit together perfectly. My son eventually found his own way to stack the pieces and make it work because doing it the ""right way"" was too hard.The I-Fell Tower set, also by BC Builders, is much easier for a 3 yr old to put together and play with by him/her self.Overall it's a great toy, especially for a kid who loves dinos and construction sets as much as mine."
1,KEEPS TILTING WHETHER YOU WANT IT TO OR NOT,I purchased this last spring (2007) from Amazon and the thing keeps tilting (the legs move outward to create a tilting surface to cook on). I guess that's useful for draining greasy foods while cooking but for eggs or pancakes it can be downright awful. The tiny nubs that are supposed to latch the legs into position are either not molded properly or not there at all. The cooking surface tilts at the most inopportune times. I'd recommend this product if the manufacturer could get that part straight. Otherwise steer clear. The surface is good non-stick and the element heats relatively evenly for a surface this large. And if you plan to cook nothing but food that needs to be drained than the tilting problem is okay and this is the one for you. The size is large enough to cook for a full family at one time. Like I said this is a good product with that one major flaw.
3,Shame of Boston,"First off if you like their first cd then you should be warned that this cd is a far cry from ""day of reckoning"". I was extremely dissapointed. It took them 3 years to make a 39 minute cd. If youre gonna make a cd that short, every song better be awesome. Half the songs are pretty good, the other half sound like filler. I can even handle the new vocalist and the melodic turn that they have gone to. Thats okay, but 39 minutes? come on guys, your fans deserve better than that. I expected more considering this is their first release on a major metal/hardcore label. P.S. for the guy below who called them part of the new wave of metal. No solos = No metal. HARDCORE 4Ever!!!"
2,Mind Numbing...,...The story line is boring and uninspiring. The little girls personality is the only thing that keeps this movie even moderately watchable.
3,Enjoyable,"I did enjoy this movie, but I still had a few problems with it.In general, it's a film worth seeing, with plenty of comedic and dramatic moments to keep your attention. I grew up with a sister in beauty pageants, so I can tell you that the satire is not too far off base.My biggest problem was that I just didn't understand the motivation for Joey Lauren Adams's character to continue to put up with all of the things that Minnie Driver's character dished at her. Who would put up with that stuff? The complexity of Minnie Driver giving up her child to Joey Lauren Adams while still living with her is not true-to-life. Imagine the emotional issues this would cause with all three of them - yet, they seem to see this sort of thing as ""normal.""I was not disappointed in the acting and did shed a tear at the end of the movie. I would recommend seeing it, just maybe not buying it."
4,Pretty good pageant movie,"This film accurately represents what many ""pageant girls"" do in order to win. Minnie Driver does a brilliant performance as Mona. The only reason this film annoyed me was that irritating Pepsi commerical twit, Hallie Kate Eisenberg. All I need is a burlap sack, some rope and a deep river for her. She is the reason I hate the movie theater. The movie is good..."
4,Slip-sliding away,"A thought-provoking book that's an easy read. I grew up near Avila Beach and we all just accepted oily feet and hands as part of the beach experience. This is a wonderful book that shows the powers of big corporations to delay, obfuscate and derail justice, using high-powered lawyers, and the legal system against the people. It makes you proud that the system worked. And it makes you wonder what the big oil companies are up to now, or the mining companies, or other big businesses."
5,Awesome and lovely!,I love this granola and like another reviewer said - the fact that I am searching for it online is an indication that it is great! I live in Los Angeles and was in love with La Brea Bakery's granola but at $8.99 for a 12oz bag I hated buying it. I found this one at Big Lots for $2.50 a bag and love it actually more! My Big Lots store has no more. I am going to order this 6-pack and eat it everyday at work with soy milk! The highlight of my morning.
3,Didn't draw me in,"The film certainly did what it set out to do ... documenting the making of a Steinway piano. There are numerous scenes depicting the various steps involved, and we get to hear the various workers talk about the pride they take in their work. We also get to watch a few notable pianists choosing their special Steinway for their special concerts. However, none of it drew me in emotionally, or really got me engaged in the documentary or story. Maybe if I were a pianist I would have enjoyed it more. Oddly, I didn't even find the music in the film to be particularly memorable. The only scene that was somewhat memorable was the scene of the family purchasing a Steinway so that the elderly grandfather, a pianist, could enjoy hearing his grandson playing. That was a lovely scene. Otherwise, the film somehow did not draw me in. It wasn't bad, just not particularly interesting or memorable."
2,NOT one-size-fits-all.,"This is a terrific idea, but not for everyone. If you wear a hat size that is L or XL, when you don your new Clic Readers the magnets will be 1/2 inch to 1 inch apart. The adjustability is in the length, not the width, so the notion that one size can fit everyone depends on how comfortable you want the fit to be, and how ridiculous you want to look in your readers. Why wouldn't the manufacturer offer these in S, M, L, and XL?"
3,Need Bigger Sizes!!!,"I love this product so much that I bought several pairs to give as gifts to all my ""old folk"" friends. Well, several of the men were unable to use them including my husband because they did not extend far enough out. WHY??? Since they are adjustable who was researching this? I know that Samual L. Jackson has a bigger head than my husband, so his must be custom. Big guys or even normal guys, you will not be able to wear these, but girls you will LOVE THEM."
2,"MORE LIKE, WHAT WAS THAT GIRL THINKING?","ONE AGAIN, UGH...YAWN..DUH..HUH? WHY? I AGREE WITH OTHERS WHO SAY THIS IS NOT A THINKING MANS MOVIE..LETS NOT MISTAKE THE MUSIC SOUNDTRACK WITH THE MOVIE..THE MUSIC IS FINE..MOVIE?? CHEESY..VERY CHEESY, AND IF YOU ARE A MADONNA FAN, YOU WILL LIKE EVERYTHING SHE DOES ANY WAY..BUT, FOR SOMEONE TRULY WONDERING, "" SHOULD I BUY THIS MOVIE..?"" RUN, RUN NOW..IF IT COSTS OVER $5. I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU, BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT A GOOD COMEDY..THERE ARE TONS BETTER, AND TRULY, GO GET ""A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN, IF YOU ARE HURTING TO SEE A MOVIE MADONNA HAS MADE THAT IS ACTUALLY GOOD..BUT, BEWARE, THE SUPPORTING CAST MEMBERS OF ""A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN"" ARE WHAT MAKE THE MOVIE SPECIAL..NOT REALLY MADONNA..BUT THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS OF ALL MAKE THAT MOVIE SPECIAL..AND SOMEONE SHOULD TELL MADONNA, NEVER GROW EYEBROWS LIKE THAT AGAIN!!!!"
1,I'll give it one star for being in focus...,"This premise was ridiculous, and Madonna's voice could not have been more annoying.I like Madonna, but I have a hard time seeing how anyone thinks this movie is entertaining."
5,WONDERFUL INFORMATION ON MARTIN LUTHER,"This is a great source for accurate information on Martin Luther and his life. It is well documented and a very enjoyable watch. I HIGHLY, RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL INTERESTED IN LUTHER!!!"
3,It broke in four months,"I had the original Allen Spring Scooper, which worked wonderfully for years for our previous Golden. I got a new one when we got a puppy in May because we threw the old one away when our Golden died. It worked good, not as good as the earlier version, until one park of the handle broke about two months into my use. I was able to continue use it with less strength until the other part of the handle broke in another 2 months so that it could not be used any more. The plastic it used obviously is too weak to handle the force from the spring. Nevertheless, I still like the concept so that I don't need to handle the warm/soft poop with my hand."
5,A fantasticly touching tale for young reders,"Laurie Swinwood's Rainbows and Other Promises is a must have any parent confronting the fears of raising children as ones own parents age. This book is a fabulous aide for explaining to children the changes that are occuring as the grand parents develop alzheimers. Anyone, not just children will be moved and captavated. This is really just a terrific book."
3,Get the lock-groove vinyl...,"It should be known that this was originally released on the great SST label as a locked-groove vinyl lp. Each of these 'tracks' on the CD, is supposed to be heard as a locked-groove (infinitely repeating). This is more of a dronework, than anything else. To fully understand these sounds, it is reccomend that they are listened to loud and on vinyl, so that the drone can manifest, and the additional sounds from the physical structure of the vinyl can enhance the experience. According to Lee on the back of the album cover, ""...I hope you will drop the diamond in a groove and let it ride awhile."" As a CD; I can only give it 3 stars, but as vinyl, I give it 5 stars. Don't buy the CD, find the vinyl on Ebay or from outofprintmusic.com."
2,Boring!!,"This girl is gorgeous and I could have spent the whole time just watching her and wishing for her amazing body. With that said, she moves through the stretches way to fast, maybe 2 seconds. The bridge series is literally 30 minutes of bridge pose, with little to no stretching. I almost fell asleep. Not for me."
1,Glad it wasn't expensive!,"This DVD contains very simple moves and is monotonous! She shows an exercise, then you get to watch her repeat the whole thing on the other side!! Nothing else to say other than don't waste your money!"
3,Not for someone with neck problems,I really like the fact that this can be done at home with no expensive equipment. The instructions are good and I am seeing some progress. The drawback to this workout is I have joint and neck issues from both an injury and inherited condition. This program is difficult to do and keep neck supported as I need.
5,I love this movie.,"Great movie for any fan of Elijah Wood, He is outstanding in this film. Also a great soccer enthusiast film to see what some of the english soccer 'firms' are all about and how they love their teams with all the heart. Very speculative viewpoints but its a MOVIE people DUH not a documentary."
3,Cheap,"This ring starts out looking good, but you can't fake quality. This is inexpensive and looks it, quickly. I am still looking for a wedding band replacement."
3,pretty ring,This is a pretty ring. The only thing I didn't like about it was how wide the band was. I like how the front of the ring looks real.
2,Gardens should be far more interesting,A very dry book for such a juicy topic. Practically unusable for my purposes.
5,Great!,"These stickups are so easy to put up!! They stick to everything, walls, closet doors, I even put them on her ceiling fan! It's given so much character to her room without it being ""cluttered"" by a border (her room is pretty small) I love love love them!"
2,With a bit of paranoia and a bit of truth we arrive here.,"After reading multiple RV-books, and meeting many Ex-Stargate officials, this book reads like a sci-fi fairy tale. Parts of his Stargate project reports are correct, but most of his ""escape""/""running"" is more than likely paranoia. If you want to read a good book search for Joe McMoneagle."
1,Remote viewing has zero validity.,"Mr. Morehouse has simply produced a piece of fiction, so that he can sell books. I feel ashamed that I bought it. Even worse, he villifies the U.S. government in doing so, by including such bogus facts, supposedly uncovered by remote viewing, as-- The U.S. government knew that poison gas was being used in Iraq. The U.S. government did make one mistake. It didn't keep a close enough eye on the CIA and its budget, if it was allowed to fund this bogus wast e of the tax payers money."
5,Brilliance Collecting Dust?,"How is it possible that this is not out on DVD yet? It was one of the highest rated events in television history. Not just Michael Jackson, who is deservedly the most remembered part of the show, but the late Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, the incredible Temps/Tops faceoff, and many other elements demand that this piece of black culture and history be placed on a medium that will preserve it as it was meant to be."
5,motown tape review,"I had previously seen this video, but it was a long time ago. I was telling my wife about it and she thought it sounded good. I looked in video stores for it before I decided to order from Amazon.com. When the item arrived , I was anxious to watch it again. My wife and I watched it together and we enjoyed it very much. The tape was in good condition. Some of the acts has since passed away so that makes it just that more valuable to me. Not monetary valuable but something that I will always treasure and will enjoy for a long time to come."
4,"Eccentric to the max, surreal and silly... a damned lot of fun.","If Rachel Griff isn't playing someone with Asperger's here, I'll stand on my head. This film is eccentric to the max, surreal, silly and certainly not a 'tight ship' production at all. But if you don't take it too seriously its a damned lot of fun. The Welsh backdrop is fabulous and the characters are quirky and highly individual, fabulously gritty and Ioan Gruffydd as her gay friend is fabulous and nothing like we are used to seeing him. The film definitely goes into the realm of slapstick and could almost be compared to a home-grown Welsh attempt at Willie Wonker And The Chocolate Factory at times. The Welsh seem to do damned well at poking fun at themselves and this makes this film a stark contrast to more English productions and rather comparable to Australian films like very slapstick Strictly Ballroom. If you enjoy comparing film styles, this Welsh prithsoduction is a lovely one for your collection."
3,Very Disappointed!,"I bought this adaptor because my kids and I have both the Nintendo DS and DS Lite. It works great on the original DS, but the thing that's supposed to fit into the DS Lite is too wide. If you're looking for an adaptor for just the regular DS, this one works great. If for the DS Lite, don't waste your money."
5,GC,"This album is excellent! It's inbetween the hardcore rock of Linkin Park and punk-pop of Busted which means people who like pop and people who like rock will love the album. My favourite tracks on this album are ''The Anthem'', ''Girls And Boys'', ''Movin' On'', ''The Day I Die'' and ''My Bloody Valentine''. All the songs are infectious and it is totally guaranteed that you'll have a particular song off this album stuck in your head for ages after listening to it!"
5,Good Charlotte Rocks!!,Ok! This album is AWESOME!! I have the other version so I don't know how Cemetary goes but i'm sure i'll LOVE it cause I love all their other music.
2,Beware Dodo Press's Version,"H.G Well's ""Little Wars"" is a classic little book that is the first pioneer war gaming to the general public.One of the great charm's of the book is the beautiful little illustrations of soldiers, cannons and pictures of the battles themselves.Dodo Press's version contains just simply the text without any of the illustrations and pictures. For the price for this book, it is simply unconscionable.I was a little deceived when I clicked on the book to see a preview of it. When you do so, you will see the original copy of the book all the illustrations and so on. At the top of the preview there is a disclaimer that the preview is for another addition.In my Christmas hurry, I did not glean this information. I have a feeling I may not be the only other one."
5,A Classic Revisited,"""Little Wars"" is a rare book in that it offers, at once, a fascinating window into the mind and imagination of a historical figure (legendary science fiction writer H. G. Wells) while serving as a very practical handbook for modern gamers. It's a must-have for both gamers and historians--and it's a fun read. The foreword by Gygax is just icing on the cake. Varhola and Skirmisher Publishing are to be commended for putting this classic in circulation once again."
3,Mediocre,"Descent melodeath that will grab you and then let you down. I listened to hear a kickass breakdown or something to make these guys standout. Never got it. If the song structures were better I would recommend this band. So, in the end you wind up with a band that has skills, but settles for mediocrity."
4,"Doesnt work and PS2, but Bandai denies any responsibility","Great series, but unfortunately Bandai has just about the worst customer service imaginable. They take several days to answer emails concerning their products, and once they do answer your email, they deny that there is any problem on their part and blame all difficulties on sony. Nevermind the fact that their new casing is cheap and their new method of making these DVDs won't work on ps2s."
2,"5 Stars for Content, 0 Stars for Format Problems!","There's not much to be said about the Escaflowne series that hasn't already been said - but a warning must go out to all Playstation 2 owners who use their machines as their exclusive DVD players... ESCAFLOWNE - PARADISE & PAIN (Vol. 5) and ESCAFLOWNE - FATE & FORTUNE (Vol. 6) are NOT PS2 compatible! This problem has been verified with DVDs purchased from multiple sources, on multiple machines - the fault lies not with Amazon, but with Bandai.Let me reiterate - Vols 5 and 6 of Escaflowne are NOT PS2 compatible discs! Why this is so, I don't understand, as ALL of the *other* discs in the series *are* PS2 compatible. Other than this inexplicable and irritating problem, this series is of the highest quality, with excellent picture and Dolby Digital sound to boot."
1,Dies after 6 months,"This is my first review EVER! Bought the pressure cooker and it died after 6 months, now NESCO says I have to pay return shipment and insurance and then wait 2-3weeks while they fix this piece of junk and return it to me.Never again NESCO!,!"
5,thinkin' & feelin',"I just purchased this CD after not having heard the album in about eight years (the cassette I had, taped from a friend's vinyl, got chewed up) and all I can say is that it's amazing! I think it's the most cohesive of all the firehose albums, and the most intense, and just plain catchy. There's great balance between the lyrics and playing, between thought and emotion, in and out, and all that. Makes me feel good about bein' a human."
5,Un libro che permette di vedere l'altro volto dell'Islam,Testo fondamentale nello studio dell'arte islamica e in grado di mostrare anche ai meno esperti i tesori di un mondo troppo a lungo sconosciuto in occidente.
5,1 big bus,this movie is about a super huge bus. weighs about 70 tons and 3 times as long about. this bus gots everything that a regular bus gots plus lot and lot more. if you like big things or just funny older movies then check this out.
5,Wonderful book!,This is one of the best books I have found for a general overview of each book of the Bible! I had to do a written summary of the books of the Bible for college and this helped tremendously!
2,An incomplete pamphlet,This pamphlet unfortunately does not cover ALL vessels that were Coast Guard manned during WWII.........
5,Teaching Happiness and Joy to Children,"One of the most important gifts we can give our children is teaching them about happiness and how to be joyful in life. Avatara Adi Da Samraj's book What, Where, When, How, Why and Who To Remember To Be Happy does this in a beautiful and profound way. It reveals great wisdom to children and adults alike about how to remember our inherent happiness and the mystery in which we live. The book is beautifully written and illustrated. The artwork is luminous and visionary. I particularly enjoyed the instruction on breathing in the happy feelings and breathing out the bad ones. This exercise has greatly benefited the children I work with in therapy. It is time we honored children's ability for spirituality and the inherent magic that exists in their world. When reading this book, it is easy for children to remember the mystery and to feel with their heart. It is a revolutionary type of children's book, one that teaches spiritual truths that are life changing."
4,Great record.,"I discovered this record while browsing music on iTunes, bought the physical disc, and was not disappointed. With the exception of the country-tinged song (""Marry Me""), the songs on this record are all GREAT power pop, replete with hooks and 80s-style melancholia. The overall sound is a mixture of the Decemberists and the Smiths, and the singer seems to channel Morrissey in certain vocal stylings/periodic yelps. The song ""I Want To Be Buried In Your Backyard,"" is a modern-day ""There Is A Light That Never Goes Out.""This album brings back what it was like to be an angst-ridden, black-clad adolescent in the 80s, when everything was about pure, dramatic, John Hughes-ian romantiscm."
4,He turned air combat upside down.,"Boyd, a rough-cut diamond developed fighter jet theories and stuck to his guns with the hide-bound Pentagon brass. We would all be richer if more military officers quit saying ""yes sir"" and used their minds to act like Boyd did.Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War"
5,To be or to do.,"This book changed my life. Since Col. Boyd never wrote much in his life, but his theories and philosophy have been so influential, a good biography was needed to flesh out his ideas into a portrait, a portfolio, a bible of sorts. This book is extremely well done. I love it and will continue to give copies to those who might take the message of Col. Boyd to heart, like I did."
2,Book on a questionable hero.,"Received the book as a gift with high expectations. John Boyd was unique within the Air Force for good reason. One has to credit his intellect with his E-M theory and OODA Loop. However, this does not qualify him for hero worship.His basic belief system seems to hinge on himself (either agree or you don't exist). He strives to achieve rank, and then, when not reaching his goal, declares that those above him have sold out. (Flipping off the USAFA Superintendant does not win support.) Discipline still counts in warfighting. Fighter pilots are extremely disciplined warriors.There is a huge difference in ""simulated"" and real combat. As an ex-USAF pilot, I let my hands do my talking. This is not ""Maverick"" from the movies, but Boyd fits the sterotype and it plays well in print.I'm left with John Boyd as an imperfect intellect. One who's ego destroyed his message and personal life. A man not to deify but to pity."
4,Excellent read,"I found this book to be an excellent read. Hard to put down, stay up late at night type of read. Is it amateur military history? Can't say, since I haven't read much else. But I felt like I knew Boyd after reading the book, and it wasn't tiresome like many other bio's, so pick it up and enjoy."
4,Really nice,"After trying some Red Lights, I put these on and got all the sparkle back that I had been missing. It's still warm sounding, but the shimmer is back that was lacking in the copper strings. I'm a strummer, and these really work for my Taylor DSCM."
4,Dirt Devil Queen,Great buy. Really durable and the fact it come in a 2-pack is even better. Good back up in case one pops.
5,best overall picture of the war,"McPherson wrote the best one volume history of the war I've seen. He blended the political situation and military actions to present a fully rounded picture of the war during it's different stages. He is sorely missed, one of the best civil war historians ever."
5,Simply the Best for new Civil War readers or long time buffs,Great book. McPherson shows why the narrative approach to writing history is far superior to the analysis of minutia that academic historians are putting out currently. This is the best single volume of the Civil War. If you read this first and then Shelby Foote's three volume treatment you will have read the very best in civil war writing.
4,Great book!,"Great Civil War History book that is educational and entertaining. I wish they had been able to include pictures from the ""Special Edition"" though."
4,reads like a novel,"This autobiography reads somewhat like a novel. Humorous, lots of sex, some discussion of racial identity issues and dating. I would have liked a little more of the latter.The book moves at a good pace but goes into the sex stuff a little too much for me. Enjoyable. Fulbeck doesn't pretend to have any answers here."
1,Put the book down slowly on the ground and back away,"Catherine Coulter is one of my favorite romance authors, but this book has to be the worst she's written in terms of plot and character. Her 'hero' is actually cruel at one point. Throughout the book, in the guise of being a 'real man', he expects the 'heroine' to do all the compromising and sacrificing while he feels noble for actually loving and marrying her. And she accepts it! I had to read this book twice just to be sure I actually remembered how awful it really is. Never again.To top it off, it's like Ms. Coulter dashed this off in a weekend and called it good. No emotional investment in the characters, no clear resolution of conflicts. I seldom meet a book I don't like, but this is one of them."
3,"Not too good, but not horrible, either","I'm usually a fan of books like this one, but I just could not get into it. I eventually finished it, but not before developing a major dislike for one of the main characters - Brant Asher. Yuck. He symbolized everything I don't like about some men - mostly his arrogance and obsession with sports. If they hadn't been fixing up that beautiful English home, I would have been really lost...Sorry - just not my idea of an enjoyable read."
2,very bad and boring,"This story was so boring. The romance between Daphne and Brant was so dumb that I swear I almost passed out from boredom. Daphne is such a weak female character unlike the Sherbrooke women or Helen Mayberry or Jack. Brant is such a jerk. This was very disappointing. Try it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you."
3,Just another war documentary,"I don't know why I had the impression that this was going to be a movie about a bunch of former comrades gathered together to watch the film that they shot and to describe to the public their experiences. Well this is just another war documentary, narrated by the now old soldiers (one by one and it was filmed at different times it isn't the reunion party that I expected). The most interesting part of the video were the few color scenes."
5,Haan Maine Bhi Pyaar Kiya,"If you like Romantic Bollywood movies, then you will love this one! I watch them on my treadmill, so I can read the subtitles with no distractions. The costumes, the storyline, the scenery , the whole movie in general will capture you and keep you to the end! The best part about these movies is there are no bad words, no graphic scenes. Just pure and simple emotional romance!"
5,Amazing book!,"This is probably one of the best fiction works I've ever read. It has all the elements needed to make this book a classic. Great plot, engaing characters, beautiful descriptions, and a sublime ending. I wasn't able to put this book down and after reading it, it stayed with me for a while. I strongly recommend this book to absolutely anyone."
2,Very dull,"The graphics are quite dull, the plot is dull, and for the most part, you are alone throughout the game. It was worth the $10 I paid but I'm glad I didn't spend more on it."
5,Wonderful Story,"Well I too, have been a fan of Cassie Edwards. Having read 43 of her books! BUt dicided to try Madeline Bakers books. And I am glad that I did. I am most definately hooked. This was wonderfully written. The book had it all. Captivating plot with outstanding characters. I loved it and will be looking for more of her books."
4,This is a very solid biography.,"We Aussies have a great deal of affection for dear old Captain Cook, who mapped our east coast whilst exploring the pacific. This book traces Cook's life and long career in an expert and readable fashion. Cook never advanced as rapidly as Lord Nelson, and traded in strictly military missions for other roles of importance to the Admiralty. But, as this fine biography shows, he stands alongside Nelson as a great British naval hero."
3,good for some,"Good for older computers ,we had the program before ,but this version wasn't updated for newer windows programs. It didn't work on windows 7 ."
5,Wiggle Time by the Wiggles,"My three-year-old daughter loves the Wiggles and this is one of her favorite CDs. We listen to it all the time. This one is particularly nice because several of our favorite songs are tracks 2, 3, and 4 -- Rock-a-Bye Your Bear, Dorothy the Dinosaur, and Her Comes a Bear. This worked well for a recent party where we played these songs form one CD and my daughter sang along on a microphone. Henry the Octopus is another favorite on this CD. Great CD! Good family fun!"
1,Dont waste your time or money!,Dryer catches clothes in the front at the rim of the drum and destroys them. Also leaves little pin holes in clothes too!
4,good read and humorous,"How men with very little to do, and a lot of time on their hands, think of creative ways to outwit the german security to escape this prison. Often exploiting the german's ability to be bribed."
2,I like punk but this cd was just plain LAME,"Don't get me wrong I love punk and all but this cd was lame. The first song is really short about 1 second to be exact, all it says is ""ALL"". The second song is pretty good. It is called ""Coolridge"" The second song is really short all it says is ""ALL? NO, ALL"" Then the 3rd song is ok then it just goes down from there. I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this cd."
5,Cracked Me Up!,This book is really funny. It's a great book for all ages. I would read it to a 5 year old or a 15 year old. It really cracked me up.
1,avoid like the plague,I purchased this lamp as a gift and the product was broken out of the box. A lot smaller than the picture leads you to believe. I would not recommend this product.
1,needs improvement,"I've also had two of these. One lasted 9 months and the other 2 months. The plastic broke in two different spots. Great design, just needs better quality control and better plastic. I would not buy again considering the other reviews with the same problem. Manufacturer needs to realize they have a problem. Actually I guess it is the consumer who gets the problem."
3,a piece of crap,"not really, it works well, but is poorly made. the plastic breaks after a few months use. i have repaired it using sheet metal screws, butt the end is near!!"
4,Extra helpful if you know a little SEO,"While it does start from scratch assuming you know nothing, I found that this book was the most helpful in filling in the gaps of what I already knew. Super easy to understand and I sat with it open next to me as I went through my site during certain sections."
5,Get More Visitors to your Site,"If you have a web site you've probably gotten e-mails from time to time offering to do all kinds of things to make your site more popular with search engines. This SPAM, of course, wants you to spend money with them.Spending a lot less for this book will tell you what these people are offering to do. All of the standard techniques from keywords in the META statements to discussing how Flash might make your site look better to the human eye but might make the site all but invisible to a search engine.This book contains all the ""secrets"" in a simple and easy to follow manner that is characteristic of the For Dummies series. This is one of those books you need to read and then to re-read every so often because it will give you new ideas to get better results from searches."
5,LOVE this book!,"While in the process of working on my new website, I came across this book and ordered it right away based on other reviews. I was not disappointed. It's a must for anyone getting ready to launch a new site or anyone wanting to drive more traffic to their already built site. Even if you think you know a lot about keywords and SEO, this is an excellent buy. It did for me what a company specializing in SEO wanted to do for $8,000. I'm sure the SEO company would have provided an excellent service, but by reading this book, I've learned how to do it myself and will now know how to tweak my site in the future."
4,A good start on your SEO journey,"I'm not a total noob at this stuff, but I'm no expert either. After reading several SEO blogs, talking to people that *think* they know SEO, I decided to buy this book. It covers the basics and does it in layman's terms. You don't have to know geek-speak to read this and grasp the concepts.I've started using some of what I have learned on my dieselforza blog and on my websites. Between this book and a few online resources, I'm getting ranked higher (but still have a long way to go :-)"
3,Gave me some of the information I needed,"This book gave me some of the information I needed, but some of it was out of date."
4,SEO for Dummies helped this Dummy,The best recommendation of any book is if it helps you accomplish your goals. This book helped increase the Alexa rankings and Google organic search results for my website [...]
3,Typical Dummies,"This book covers alot of the basics, but when it starts to get into specifics it turns into a large product endorsment. The book goes over some of the general ideas behind SEO but there are entire chapters that are written as a step by step for some third party software. The book stays true to its title as being ""for dummies"", but if you are looking for an in depth explanation to some of the specific how-to's. Look elsewhere.In the books defense it promotes itself as not being for developers, but more for managers that are hiring developers. This might have been nice to know before I purchased it."
3,A Rare Monster Film,"This old Yongary film has never had a DVD release in the U.S.AFinally, here it is!A nuclear test in China releases a giant dinosaur from hibernation. The monster rampages through Korea, ready to stomp and destroy! Made when Godzilla reached the height of his popularity, Yongary, Monster from the Deep was a blatant attempt to capitalize on the sucess of that most popular of movie dinosaurs. This movie is quite similar to Giant Monster Gamera, made at about the same time. It was dubbed and released in the US, much to the delight of b-movie fans!"
2,A rarity for Kaiju people...,"Not an easy title to find, I bought it more to compleate my collection than to actually watch it. The first Korean Kaiju, it's quickly established that this was made to cash in on Toho's success with only a tiny fraction of the budget. While amusing at times, the cheap production often gets in the way of doing something that rarely adds much to a movie's cost - good writing. It's just not that good.Now the newer version, also known ( and shown on Sci-Fi Channel) as ""Reptillian"" is a much better film - dispite some of the worse gajin actors since the international version of ""Gamera the Invinceble"". With it's own glitches being much more entertaining than the original, this is a remake that delivers and is worth getting.Kaiju people have their own way of rating films and are usually very forgiving of compromised production values, the original ""Yongary"" just isn't that good."
5,Lo Mejor De tu Vida,"Excellente album,Con 13 bellas canciones en la voz de Tamara incluyendo algunos covers,Recomiendo ampliamente este CD a todos aquellos que sean amantes de la musica romantica."
3,Why so expensive ?,"I have no review of the content, just of the price. This book was one of two required texts for my 15 year old's high school Spanish class. Yikes - the book is fine, but why so expensive? Other parents felt the same way. We paid more for this paperback book than for the other textbook which has a hardcover binding."
5,Jesus ws a Storyteller,"This book is a wonderful resourse for any minister or pastor.The author has a brilliant style of blending stories into the truths of the Gospel.After all Jesus was a storyteller.His parables are evidence of his masterful way with the truth.My own congregation have felt the benefit of ""Story Telling The Word""."
4,First Time Listener,"This is a review from someone who knows absolutely nothing about clasical guitar. I can say that I've only recently begun to study the guitar and have come to realize how difficult it is to play it well. I enjoyed all of the pieces on this CD, especially ""Bouree"" and ""Etudes"". The sound quality and the overall flow of the pieces were both very good. Mostly, what stands out is the quality of the performances;all were wonderful."
3,"A bit more ""traditional"" than expected :)","I do like his sound, but I hadn't expected it to sound like the traditional/stereotypical French music of the past. I may be the only one who thinks it sounds that way, though. I like it either way."
2,misguided revision,"I bet the original is interesting and maybe fun to cook from. The revised edition tries to celebrate the history of the original while providing practical updates, but the result is an unsatisfying compromise that is a little like the overcooked vegetables it suggests you make -- bland, flavorless and not all that practical. Did I overextend that simile? Whatever, if you like your food history spliced with depressing 90s-era diet tips and microwave cookery, buy this book. Otherwise, uh, don't."
1,Chips easily! Not for the microwave!,"These dishes chip VERY easily! I've had my set for a year and nearly half have a chip on some edge. Also these are NOT good for the microwave! The plate heats up much quicker than the food. For example, I would typically microwave a hotdog for 45-60 seconds. Even after this short length of time, the plate is too hot to touch bare-handed. I cannot plate my children's food, heat it in the microwave, then give it to them because the plates are too hot. I had Pfaltzgraff for years and never had either of these problems. Looks like Target wasn't such a good deal after all."
4,GOOD. 17th april 2004.,"It is a good film, and it is based on a girl who's mum never treated her with her best simpathy when she was younger. She is grown up now, and sidda meets her mum again after all that time. It keeps going back to when she was a child. I thought of it as been one of them films that it may not suit everyone."
3,Not As Bad As I Feared It Would Be,"I had to watch this thing because it was my wife's birthday. Her book club had read this book and, even though she thought the book was bad -- ""Nobody talks like this,"" she kept saying -- she wanted to see how it had been treated on film. My wife is from Central Louisiana, and she said the accents in the film were deplorable, nobody in Louisiana talks like that.The film wasn't as horrible as I feared it would be...For the most part, it's the tired old story of buried childhood trauma in a dysfunctional family of the Deep South. Ashley Judd was extremely pretty, and made the movie somewhat bearable for a guy to watch without running screaming from the room."
2,The Blah Blah sisterhood..,"With a cast like this bringing a book like this to screen, I was hopeful that this would be a great movie experieince...and was thoroughly disappointed.The film version was not able to, or just plain didn't, capture the complexities of the characters as a whole. And the acting...Maggie Smith, one of the GREATS, is reduced to Lifetime TV fare with her BAD southern accent. It's a shame to see a woman of this calibur talent wasted so horribly. And Burnstein plays her imbalanced character too over the top to be believable. Bullock isn't challenged much in her role, making her again trapped in a part that makes no use of her screen presence or talents.Overall, rent this movie if you must see it, or better yet, wait until it comes on cable or something...but seeing this movie and paying good money for it are two entirely different things."
3,Was okay,"It is definitely a girl movie. I saw it and thought it was simply cute and somewhat touching. Predictable? yes. Some people compare it to Steel Magnolias but, I still think Steel Magnolias is lot better. Had more drama and was definitely a tear jerker. This Ya Ya movie was kind of blah. No drama or excitement. It was very quiet."
4,Great movie!,It was only a tad bit confusing to try and keep up with who was who (adult vs. child) but all-in-all it was a great movie! Definitely worth a second look-see!
2,The Blah Blah Sisterhood,"With a cast like this bringing a book like this to screen, I was hopeful that this would be a great movie experieince...and was thoroughly disappointed.The film version was not able to, or just plain didn't, capture the complexities of the characters as a whole.

2,Too close for comfort,"I've not seen this point of view mentioned so at the risk of annoying those who love this movie, I have to throw out a little caution. I am the oldest daughter of an alcoholic who had not read the book first. Parts of this were very hard to watch and still prey on my mind. Given that perspective, I guess it's not surprising that I did not enjoy this movie and could not feel any affection for its characters or satisfaction at its ending. What I AM left with though is admiration for Ashley Judd, Ellen Burstyn and the actress who played the young Siddalee, they were amazing. Sorry to be a wet blanket, maybe I need a visit from some Ya-Yas."
2,Cheap Action Flick,"Not a very good movie at all. Two stars I think is pretty generous. I dont know who the main actor is. There are alot of things wrong with this movie. I know Action films dont have to be 100% accurate, but some of the things in this movie I think were just impossible. Alot of parts didnt make sinse, the ending was not the best. And over all it just seemed like it was written by a 12 year old."
1,I really hate this song.,"Well, there are a few ways to demonstrate that you're like a bird: You can be graceful like a bird. You can fly like a bird. You can sing like a bird. You can crap all over car windows.Or, to avoid any chance that people might not notice the similarity between you and birds, you can just be like Nelly Furtado and announce, ""HEY EVERYBODY! I'M LIKE A BIRD!""Wow, cool. Let's break up."
2,When best intentions go awry,PUMPKIN has a heart of gold but the skin is a rather weakly constructed attempt to make a case for Special People whose handicaps become their badge of bravery and triumph. The idea is great but the writing is trite and the cast just isn't up to the same level of quality as the leads Ricci and Harris. Unfortunately this little film's heart of gold grows maudlin. And that is a shame.
1,Good movie-Nast language,"I saw this movie on TV and evidentally it was edited. I have an autistic grandson who loves the girl actress in this movie so I ordered it for him. Well, needless to say, for a movie for young people, this one was trashed because every other word was a slang word...the 4 letter kind! It was so appauling that the swearing took away from the movie. The story itself is wonderful. I was so dissappointed."
2,Falls Flat...,"Hoping to discover an off-beat independent comedy, I picked up Pumpkin last time I rented some DVDs. I was completely disappointed. Being ""independent"" doesn't automatically make a movie worthwhile. This movie lacks any real punch, in the dramatic, comedic, or stylistic framework it attempts to fill. First of all, Christina Ricci is hard to believe as the girl with the ""perfect"" life. She is much more suited to her former darker and more naturalistic roles. The plot is far-fetched (not always a bad thing...but here it is), at times offensive, and repetitive. I watched the entire movie hoping that somehow the end would justify the means but the end seemed to hammer that last nail in the coffin. I give it two-stars because it made me smile or chuckle once in a while but mostly I just shook my head. May pumpkin rest in peace."
1,The Dumbing Down of America,"This movie is an example of America lowering its standard and dumbing itself down. How did this even make it to film?Terrible acting. Do college women/girls really act this childish? This film comes very close to insulting the Special Olympics and its athletes. It also depicts one ""challenged"" kid beating up another one. Which I guess is supposed to be funny??Is it a comedy? A tear jerker? A sophisticated study of morals? This film trys to be all of them but FAILS on all accounts big time.Rent I Am Sam or What's Eating Gilbert Grape instead."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this item because it was supposed to be made of metal. Should have read the review first. The back panel is plastic, which totally defeats the purpose of having a metal (and code compliant) outlet strip. While it does seem well made, I now have to search for a real metal outlet strip. I would have been willing to pay more too, if the enclosure was all metal."
4,Very Good Dead DVD,"The best from the set. Very well played. The only downside is the filming, and those HORRIBLE special effects. Beware of them when you get this. Anyway, all in all this is great. the audio is perfect. GET THIS!"
5,another great vault release... plus 5.1 sound!,"Volume four from the ""View From The Vault"" series features two excellent '87 shows with fantastic set lists and strong playing. Like the other DVDs, the video is taken from the ""cameras for the people in the back rows"". The band plays really well at both shows.The sound quality is fantastic. They used a dolby digital 5.1 (as well as 2.0) mix, and it pays off in dividends.Even if you could ""take or leave"" the visuals of the band, having two great '87 shows mixed in 5.1 for Amazon's fantastic price would make this DVD a must have for any Deadhead, and a great introduction for anyone just getting into the band.Highest of recommendations."
4,Great book for your kid's library,"One special thing I do with my son is take him to the bookstore every other Saturday and let him pick out a new book for his ever-growing library. The last time we went, instead of first picking out ten and narrowing it down, he walked right for this book and chose it. And it's been his favorite ever since. The book has some nice photography, the dogs in the book are very cute, and the story has a nice message for kids."
5,Great book!,All you dog lovers out there will love this book for your kids! It has adorable pictures and a really cute story. My 2 year old son just loves looking at the pictures in this book.
4,very good hard rock,Lots of guitar shredding and hell bent for leather singing. Very good hard rock. WOuld love to see them live.
4,Skip this and buy Milo,"I bought this b/c it was only a few bucks more than Milo Goes To College, and it had 7 more songs. I should've just bought Milo. This record is Milo Goes To College, and Fat. Fat is pretty mediocre. The only cool song from Fat that I anticipate listening to in the future is ""Weinerschnitzel"". Don't spend the extra dough on this one. Just buy Milo. It's terriffic. Everything a punk record should be."
4,Great album!,"The 4 stars instead of 5 unfortunately is for seller. It was stated that the cd was scratched lightly, but was led to believe it was superficial. The last track on cd skipped twice, which leads me to believe seller never tried it. Hoping when I load it on pc it can buffer the scratches. Other then this oversight, cd arrived ahead of schedule and was very happy to see the original oop cd listed so modestly. This double album is so great, and if you have never heard the descendants this is where you start!"
5,great fun for my daughters,"This is the second time I bought this kit, this time for my younger daughter. she loves it just as much as her older sister did when we bought it for her. Older sister got very excited, and led younger sister through various activities. Good for 8-10 year olds"
1,Don't buy it,"Just a flat out terrible experience. The product is not at all as pictured, and not at all as described in the product description. The contents are not as ""colorful"", ""fun"" or ""safe"" as indicated. I returned it."
3,Recommended age not as advertised,I ordered this for a 7 year old's birthday party. When I received it I saw that the box said 9 years and up. The details here on Amazon clearly say 6 years and up. I am hoping Amazon will pay for return shipping. I had to go out and buy something else.
3,Not as good as his other stuff,"Seems a bit more radio-friendly than his other stuff. A bit too ""poppy"" for me. The songs built as you would expect them, but you don't get the feeling that they really deliver."
4,A great technically explained book,"This author always writes with an easy and humourous style. The content is very technical yet the explanations are easy to understand, much like his other books. I would recommend this to any pilot thinking of doing their IFR rating."
5,Fantabulous brush!,"I know it seems like a huge brush...that's b/c it IS! It's almost as large as my head, but it works great to give my hair that Farrah feathered look on my short layers. I just got it, but it seems durable, and quality. And, I shopped around alot and this was the best deal for this large of a brush. I definitely recommend."
2,Cute but loose,"I bought these to accessorize a Halloween costume. The bows are nice, and even held up to a wash. However, the elastic is awkward, and the material is loose (similar to the way really old tights feel). Served their purpose and looked cute, however, I probably would not purchase again."
5,Best Cookbook,I bought this cookbook brand new many many years ago. I have cooked the recipes with great results from most every page. My grown kids were always calling me for recipes from this book. So I was happy to find the cookbook here on Amazon. I had it sent directly to my son and he is happy to have it. He said it looks brandnew.Thanks!
5,book review,"Having owned it in the past, and lost it, I needed it for a class (Child Psych). It is a wonderful series but difficult to read. It is difficult due to it pulls on the readers emotions and heart strings, no matter how macho or man'ly one is."
4,Hugo Boss,This is a very good looking watch. It goes with dressy or casual and it makes you feel well=dressed.
1,Very disappointed,Even with my finger firmly on the cap it leaked while shaking it. I now have balsamic vinegar staining my kitchen wallpaper. The resulting Vinaigrette dressing left a lot to be desired too.
4,"many good recipies, not Italian!","good quality, made of glasseasy to cleanthe markings have lasted quite a while even with washingthe cover is secureno Italian recipe though"
4,man with large garden/property,"this is not a flame thrower in the military sense, it is a ""garden flame thrower"" for weed control, and would make a poor weapon . it has a range of about 8 inches, and is very heavy & clunky. it does, however, allow one to clear weeds quickly. i have a large area covered in gravel, and my flame thrower takes care of the spring weeds with less environmental cost than herbicides. BUT DO NOT USE DURING FIRE SEASON!"
2,Tiny Small Metrosexual watch,"THis was a reminder of the best reason NOT to shop online- Sometimes photos lie. The photo showed a large looking lite brown leather watch in reality once it arrived, watch was small dark leather and very girlish looking urg! very disapointing. I gave it to a gay friend of mine."
3,Good Toy for Dinosaur Lovers,"This toy was a gift for a little dinosaur lover. He loved it! It is just the right size for him to carry every where he goes. Came with some information on the dinosaur as well, and a picture catalog of other products which entertains him too."
5,Best value I can find,"Scoured the web for these 1"" babies. Seemed the be as good as there larger kin. Best price around that I could find. Shipped fast."
3,Not as nice as I had expected,The wires are wrapped in old style friction tape which is certain to become stickey on the outside after hours in a hot car. I'm surprised that they didn't use a plastic sleeve or plastic spiral wrap instead of friction tape. Very poor construction.
4,Well done,"All four readers are excellent, including Nixon. It was a delight to hear Shirley Booth again. Only could have been improved with the addition of Lauren Bacall's recordings."
1,"""I think I just threw up in my mouth a little...""","After being involved with theater for years and teaching English, I would like nothing more than to post my own thoughts on this film; however I think the most accurate review I can give is through my students' comments:""Why does Antigone look like a man?""""Why aren't they talking?""*plugs ears* ""Aaah! What's with that music?""""These people are possessed! If not, it sure sounds like it!""""When Ismene tells Antigone about their brothers' deaths, why does it look like they're about to have sex?""""When Antigone goes to the fallen body of Polyneices, why does it look like she's trying to kiss it? What's that called again... necrophilia?""""Why does Haemon look more like a woman than Antigone?""""I think this is the worst movie... ever... Even worse than Mommy Dearest."""
1,It's not a movie,A documentary that monotonously talks about a kid who disappears and his family. the new fellow who mysteriously shows up 3 years later is a Spanish and suckers the family to believe the lost kid is him.
2,Did not like this at all.,"This movie was not worth the money. I was not impressed with it at all especially with the ending. It got good reviews which is why I decided to watch it, but wasn't for me!"
1,worste,"what a terrible movie. I quit watching before the ""hook"" but if it took this long to get to it, I don't care. What a terrible movie. The main character is someone nobody cares about. Like I said, I quit watching so I do not know what happens...but I wish this hispanic person would have died very early on in the film. I know his outcome might be ""so awsome"" but who the ""F"" cares. I know there is a ""whoa"" moment when we are all supposed to be astonished by how enlightening this doc/s*** piece of recorded trash is, but I did not see it.Please write back and tell me how dumb I am becuase I dont get it."
2,It was not reliable.,I bought this device to enhance VOIP on my home network. When I first got it seemed to work great. Then it locked up and nothing could get out to the internet within about 3 days of having it setup. I had to disconnect it for a about an hour to get working again. Maybe a heat issue. The I was getting complaints of VOIP quality issues. More than one person describe me as sounding like I was on spaceship. Disconnecting the device Correct my issues. It returned to where it was purchased. I have QoS turned on my linkSyS router and that seems to work well for my setup.
3,Best of the Three,"Best of the the three B'last releases. Don't know chronological order for their releases, but this one sounds like they are finally getting their act together, musically. It's listenable. The other two weren't."
4,For Beat heads!,"This set is pure instrumentals. Most of the beats are chill, some stand out more than others. They are easily recognizable as MF DOOM beats, they use samples from diverse sources, a notable beat is Humrush with a funky kermit the frog sample! The songs are shorter than their counterparts in the other cds, but thats reasonable."
1,Wacom Pen w/Cap Broke repeatedly,"The Wacom pen broke immediatly after I removed it from the packaging. The cap was stuck firmly on the body, and when I pulled it off, the body of the pen separated. While I could push the body back together, it would not stay - the glue was broken. I returned that pen, and asked for a replacement. The replacement broke in exactly the same way. I still want a more comfortable pen to use with my tablet top PC, but I recommend strongly against the Wacom w/Cap."
2,Capless is much better,"I am an efficiency/business coach and a Tablet junkie. I love my Fujitsu T4210 and use it as my only computer. For me, having the best pen on the market was a must.The capless Wacom Cross pen is the best available at any price. Go with that. This Capped version is botha) slow to use (have to take off the cap)b) not as durable (the Cap actually broke apart, both the sleeve from the silver lining, and the clip itself)Please see the capless version and my review for some tips on how to get the most out of the Cross pen."
1,Disintegration Station,Ignoring the other warnings I purchased this pen to use with my wacom tablet as the wacom2 seems to no longer be available anywhere. The back of the pen fell off within 4 days. After 2 weeks the rest of the pen completed its disintegration cycle and has broken completely apart into 5 pieces.The glue they use must be rated for temperatures no warmed than say... 75 deg. f.Stay Far Away.
4,Wolves: A Complete Digest,"Gibbons has created a complete study of wolves that is geared toward younger readers. Vocabulary is introduced and explained. Labels are placed in the illustrations to further understanding of the concepts. The illustrations are colorful and exciting. All in all this is a wonderful information book on wolves that engages the child. Features of the text include a map, diagrams of wolves body language, synopsis of some legends and tales, and a lesson on the reasons to protect the species. This book is a good teaching tool as well as an enjoyable read for children."
1,Bad smell and taste,"Valhrona cocoa is proof a higher price does not always indicate a better product. This does not even smell like cocoa and has a very odd taste. It tastes like it's been smoked or has spices in it, very green tasting. It absolutely ruined icing I made for eclairs. It faired a bit better in cookies, but still has a funky aftertaste. I checked it out on the Cooks Illustrated website and it is not recommended (if you are unfamiliar, Cooks Illustrated is the ""Consumer Reports"" of the cooking world). I wish I would have checked it out before I bought it."
3,country karaoke,"its ok not the best plus i could have got it cheaper at eb games which is a game store in Meridian,Id"
5,The most touching portraits I've seen.,"This book is incredible. I am an artist myself and have seen more than my share of photographic portraits and none of them touch the quality of these. It is the kind of book you can look at again and again. There is nothing pathetic or dramatic about these photos, they are pure and seem to cut right to the truth of the subject. Whether the cause of Tibet is something you are passionate about or not - the spirit and life in these portraits will make you feel like you are seeing the soul of the subject and want to do something to help."
4,"Well researched, thought-provoking","A finely researched piece of history by British folklorist Goss and Titanic specialist Behe (the author of an earlier book on alleged psychic forewarnings of the Titanic tragedy). The authors go back to first-hand and contemporary sources, and in the process clear away much rubbish contributed by less careful authors. Subjects covered include The Flying Dutchman (a first-rate summary of a complex legend), the ghost of the U28 and the disappearance of the Waratah. Recommended."
1,like slogging through cement!,"Boring, academic and tiresome! It is well researched but if you are looking for scary stories you will be frustrated overdetailed, bad writing. Good lord, I never thought a book about ghost ships would put me to sleep!"
3,Great for REALLY small scoops,"This cone can handle 1-1/2 inch diameter scoops-I used a spoon to get the ice cream onto the cones. Held up fine, sturdy enough for one scoop portions. would use this again in kid-sized situations."
4,cool software,This software seems really cool. The way it functions is smart.But one thing I noticed is that it doesn't seem to have that manynames or nicknames for some objects just the messier number.
3,Flashy User Interface But Too Few Objects,"The program gets high marks from those impressed by attractive front ends. Indeed, in this class of software, such things should not be belittled; that's why I rated it as highly as I did.I became disappointed when I looked for an object in the NGC catalog and discovered it wasn't there. As far as I can tell, for DSO's, the program delivers only the Messier objects. If I hadn't had another program (The Sky), I should not have found The Eskimo Nebula."
2,Flimsy...,"This is very very very thin rod and it did work for a week, after which it started sagging. Our curtain is very light and even so... Its going back!"
4,Very pleased.,"Very pleased with these curtains rods. You can not put a lot of weight on them, but they are great for lighter weight fabrics."
4,exactly what I needed,"Pillow is pretty firm, a bit on the smaller side, in a great blue-ish grey hue, which was pleasantly unexpected. Overall, I recommend."
5,Grow with First 2 Minutemen LPs,"Like another reviewer here, I caught the Minutemen's whirl-a-gig jazz at a young age, but unlike him it's settled in nicely in my memory. The Minutemen opened me to Coltrane and Ornette, and the elliptical artistic attack of Boon, Watt, and Hurley continues to explode good sense as far as I'm concerned. They're at their most elegant here, finishing off practically every song under two minutes. Favorite lyric: ""Pack a chunk of the sun/Glue it to your heart hold on."" If you happen to have money to splurge, you could buy both of these albums separately: they were released a little more than a year apart, and while ""The Punch Line"" forms the musical foundation for everything to follow, ""What Makes A Man Start Fires?"" is thick, rich and strange enough to demand its own hearing. D. Boon's ghost might say, ""Go econo."""
1,"Golf Gifts & Gallery 62"" Umbrella","This umbrella does not provide 62 inches of coverage as the advertisementleads you to believe. The 62 inches are across the crown not the width. Icalled about the first one I received and complained that the coverage was only about 48 inches, not 62. The customer service rep. told me the 48 wide was shipped in error and he would indeed ship me one that covered 62 inches.The replacement he sent was exactly like the first one, about 48 inches of coverage,not 62. This is a good umbrella, but I can buy almost the identical umbrella locally for $12.00 and no shipping charge.I am returning one of the umbrellas,however I am less than satisfied about the whole deal.I feel that if you are gong to advertise a 62 inch umbrella it should cover 62 inches.I really didn't need another 48 inch umbrella as I have four or five lying around. I wanted the additional coverage for a specific purpose. James Barber 103 Windy Lake Cove,Vicksburg,Ms 39183"
1,Broke on second use.,This umbrella is hard to open and close. One of the plastic clips that holds the small pin that allows the umbrella to open and close broke the second time I used the umbrella.
2,Not as strong as I expected,I was a bit dissapointed as this umbrella was a gift and not as strong as expected. It broke on the 3rd use.
1,Not so hot,Not as large as advertised. Plastic piece above spring designed to hold umbrella bows when collapsed split cracked and fell off on first use. Would not buy again.
2,Awful smell...,"It's a decent enough umbrella. Nice and big. However it doesn't telescope and the whole thing reeks of rubber/polymers and will make your hands and other things smell. You can leave it outside on a balcony to air out, but it won't do much."
1,Wrong color,"It could have been a good deal. However, the listed color for the umbrella is black, but what I received is green and white strips! It is really ugly! It works fine, but I hate being duped!"
3,Nice style,I like this watch and very suprise to style and all functions. All works and I recommended to you to consider to buy this stuff. Rudytarigan.
1,The indiglo never did work,"Everything else works well, but the reason I bought this was to see the time at night, without indiglo, it doesn't matter that everything else works."
2,Poor resolution and no audio,"I bought this so I could watch programs from my PC on my TV including downloaded videos and netflix movies. I was not able to get the audio going and the resolution was not very good. I consider myself fairly technically adept, but I wasn't able to improve these things no matter what I tried. The distance between the two devices is about 10 ft and I should probably consider devices that directly connect, but since I have a laptop, I thought it would be good so that I could move around a bit if I needed to."
1,Difficult Usage....I gave up,"I purchased these about a year ago. Yes they are RF but the signal, when I finally did get both in sync, didn't communicate sound. I was able to get sound and pic on my television but with strong interference. I do not recommend. I never did find another product comparable to wireless pc to tv converters."
2,Scraping the barrel.,"The pervading feeling I got from this collection of short stories was that it was everything that was ""left over"" or ""didn't make the cut"" from Realms of the Dragons, Volume One.None of the short stories were engaging by any stretch of the imagination. Some, like ""Freedom's Promise"" possess interesting plots, but are written in a manner that ruins the whole effect. (Freedom's Promise was 100% predictable and does not deviate at all from what you would expect it to be).To further support the ""left overs"" theory, the last thirty pages of this novel are excerpts from other novels; single-chapter snippets that serve only to fill printing space.Unless you're a die-hard fan of the series, avoid this one."
3,Normal,"This item works in quiet but it seems too small, I am not sure if it can be fuctional in a 160 square feet room."
2,Vapor-eze,"I guess it would be ok for a car, but it's just too small for anything larger. I use it for a barracks room in Afghanistan. It's struggling to make a dent."
2,not very effective,it's too small to to do much. It didn't even last a month and the filters already need replacing and I didn't feel a difference in air quality. i like the innovation but it needs to be bigger and although I paid $40 the retail of $69 is way too much.
5,Beautiful pendant. But take these reviews with a grain of salt.,"The pendant is beautiful and I think its recipient liked it. It is smaller and thinner than I'd expected but that's my own fault for not looking up the product dimensions.That said, anyone buying this product on the virtue of the reviews should be aware that whenever Gem Avenue receives a positive seller rating, they request that their buyers review the products positively as well. Therefore, the reviews that appear here are skewed to reflect the buyers who liked the product, not those who didn't.I, for one, liked the product. But caveat emptor."
5,Radiant Jewelry,"I have bought a few Swarovski pendants and earrings from Gem Ave. They are beautiful and sparkle like diamonds. The products arrived very quickly. They are inexpensive and feel great to wear. The pendantsare very light.Buy one for yourself and one for a friend!Michele,Phoenix, AZ"
5,"A Truly Magic, Heartwarming Film","Produder/Director,William Sachs has crafted a simple storyline and turned it into very charming, funny, and touching tale that is perfect for the whole family.Ben Kingsley, as Zamboni, ""The Spooky Man"", turns in a masterful performance in concert with the new, natural, and talented Matt Weinberg as Kingsley's young counterpart and eventual cohort.Encountering the ""bad kids"", ably headed by Mercedes Ruehl,our young group of heroes, lead by Kingsley and Weinberg, send us on a merry chase with magic illusions and a surprise, touching conclusion which wraps up the adventure in a delightful way.This is a little classic with a big heart that belongs in everyone's video library. And, for once, the price is quite reasonable (for the DVD)."
5,"For me, her best yet","I've enjoyed everything Kelly has done, especially her uptempo songs. She has a way of being fully natural and involved and yet getting every technical element perfect. She and her traveling group are great as well, worth seeing if you ever have the chance. This album has taken up permanent residence in my car, and although every track is well done, I can honestly say that I get that ""Oh, good, this one!"" feeling when any but a couple start to play. Her other albums ""only"" did that for about 6 each. Her styles have expanded a little, and her art is consistent."
4,Another Treat,"When the legendary Nashville Tony Brown signed Willis to a major label deal in the 1990s, she seemed destined to be the next big thing in real country music (especially for fans who don't like country music). It never happened and she's settled into marriage and child-rearing with songwriter Bruce Robison. So her occasional releases have been treats, glimpses of what could have been. On her latest, she and producer Chuck Prophet wrap her soothing voice around a variety of cuts with varied success. The best are ""Don't Know Why,"" written by Willis, Prophet and Jules Shear, ""Sweet Little One,"" a gentle beaut; ""The More I'm Around You,"" an unabashed piece of pop, and a surprisingly raw cover of Iggy Pop's ""Success."" A couple of duds include a cover of ""Teddy Boys,"" which makes your teeth grate. Still, it's a pleasure to enjoy Willis's stunning voice again on tunes like the title cut and imagine what could have been."
4,Good watch for the money,"Excellent watch. Survived me after almost a year of punishing use. I swam with it, and always wore it while in the shower. Not a full 5 star due to to main reasons:1.) The front plastic screen fell off (just recently)2.) the lap timer is not very user friendly. You cannot review the laps after you see them once. So, if timer goes from lap 1 to lap 2, you won't be able to review lap 1.Otherwise, I may still buy myself another one."
3,Indiglo light on Timex Expedition stopped working,"This is the second Expedition watch I've bought, and I was happy with the first one. But this one's Indiglo backlight just stopped working one night. The backlight was one of the ""must have"" features I bought the watch for, so now I need a new watch even though everything else works fine.Disappointing, especially since I've read that other Timex buyers have had this problem too."
4,Cute little locket,"I've been wanting a simple little locket for some time and this fits the bill. It's a nice, shiny silver with a decent chain. Good clasp and opens easily. There are small plastic heart pieces on the inside that aren't really cut that well so they're not practical to use to cover the picture inside. I'm not sure you could fit it in over the picture anyway, just not enough room.Because of it's smaller size, I'll probably buy a bigger one at some point and give this one to my daughter as I think it work quite well as a child sized locket. I'm happy with the $14 I paid for it, but probably wouldn't pay much more."
4,"Positive In, Positive Out","The author offers realistic training tips that families sharing their homes with a dog can use. Few pages wasted on theory -- readers bought the book because they agree with clicker training and Parsons understands this.However, I would have liked to seen a conclusion, reinforcing what these gentle methods good and final words of encouragement. In addition, it would have been better to have more than one case study anwering the question, ""Will this approach work on dogs other than the author's?""I've been using what I learned and have been better able to manage my dog's leash aggressive. Plenty of tips that will keep me busy for months and years as I revisit them."
1,One Two Many Good Click,"This is a very good book on the whole and if you are new to training is especially useful. However, I did find it a bit repetitive. By about three quarters through I had the message and it was rather predictable. Since I have used clicker training and do competitive obedience training I may not have gotten as much out of it as others might. I would recommend it for trainers who have been using corrective training methods and need to update their skills. Also helpful for new owners with reactive dogs."
2,Not what was expected,"I purchased this book along with two other publications I expected to be books as well, but these turned out to be little pamplets that are the size usually found in a Veternarian's office to read while you wait and many times are free if you want them. The shipping charges were ridiculous for the amount of merchandise shipped.The book itself gave the impression of being a guide to the clicker control dog training course. This book merely speaks of using the method gives no information on how to use it or where to acquire the clicker itself or what ever equipment is needed. The other two so-called books measure 8 1/2"" X 5 1/2"" one has 29 pages the other 14 pages, so you can imagine how much information you will get out of them. I am terribly disappointed in my purchases and will know better than to buy books online. It's worth a trip to a book store to avoid such a rip off."
1,requires unavailable optional power supply,"I purchased this device for use on a Lenovo Thinkpad X60. I followed the installation instructions, but the Windows device manager said that the device was not working properly. I called Iogear technical support and was assisted by a very helpful person. However, after 10 minutes on the phone with him, the verdict was that my laptop was not providing enough power for the card and that I would need the ""optional power supply"" for the gpf113. I called their customer service, who told me that this power supply is not currently available and that he could not tell me when it would be available. I was instructed to register with their web site so as to be notified when the part is available, so that I may then purchase it (for some not-yet-known price).So, perhaps in the not-too-distant future, for some soon-to-be-disclosed price, I will find out whether the device actually works."
3,united cutlery undercover tanto,"I got this knife to compare it to my cold steel spike tanto, just to see how it would measure up. (at $8 after shipping even if it was bent it would be worth the steel at least) Upon getting it, the first thing I noticed was that the steel was of rather low quality. It was not very sharp, and after just a few cuts on the box it came in, it lost its sharpness completely. At least it was very easy to re-sharpen. The overall design looks alot like the cold steel tanto spike.. save it's darker, shorter, heavier, less sharp, and thicker. If I were asked which would be best as a self-defence knife, I'd say, spend the extra $16 and get the cold steel spike tanto, as this one seems better as a throwing knife."
5,Some Great Material,"Some of their best stuff is on here. ""Buzz or Howl"" tends towards abrasive, Pere Ubu-ish noise with guitar thrash backing. It's mostly pretty great and the band never sounded more muscular or tighter. And that's saying something. As on previous records, they are extremely intense and very ambitious.""Project Mersh"" (mersh is short for commercial) is less ambitious, points up for the funny cover though. They try to make a more conventional, acceptable rock sound on here. Mike Watt's songs remain too idiosynchractic and insular to really hit that mark, but Boon's ""Cheerleaders"" and ""King of the Hill"" stand with the band's best, and would have been heard at the time were there justice in the world."
4,ONE YEAR AND STILL KICKING!!!,"I purchased this DVD Player just over one year ago and it is still working perfectly! I use it almost every day to play at least one DVD, and have not had any problems. The tray only opens 75% of the way, but I have no trouble inserting or removing the DVD's. There are no children in my household, if there were I would be concerned about the tray braking, this is not a concern for me as I treat all my electronics with CARE.P.S. Well as of 2/27/2006 it gave up the ghost, not a bad run for the price, but must subtract one star. Now a 3 star!"
4,great for the price,"It does what its supposed to do. the putting green could be better, but the putter does work good! and for the price you cant beat it. def recommend! my husband uses it for hours!"
2,A very boring book,"I was really disappointed with this book.There was no plot, just the bus used as a vehicle to bring characters together but there was no real chemistry between them. The ending was just that. The book finished. This book felt as though it was a commission that had to be filled. It lacked ideas and the writing was staid. Ms. Binchy can do much better than this and I dont think this book has done her any favours. I'm sure it will sell on past reputation. It will be interesting to see what it does to future sales."
4,Short Stories,"Each story is about a different person, looks in the characters' minds and how they view the others they travel with. I liked Binchy's heartwarming style, there is no end like typical novel. That makes the book unique, it does not try to give you a message."
1,Disappointed again,Gads not again. I read London Transports and was disappointed and now this one. I have read all of her work and these two are the only ones I didnt like.
5,Wonderful short stories,"My wife, a huge Maeve Binchy fan, recommended that I check out this book. I could not be more pleased.While each of the stories stood on their own merit and were quite engaging, I very much enjoyed the way they intertwined. And it is amazing the way in which Binchy can flesh out her characters in only ten or fifteen pages. (Oh, Nancy Morris, God help you...)Last month, I read my first Richard Russo novel. This month, Maeve Binchy.I have some good reading ahead of me."
3,The Lilac Bus...where is the ending,"I thought this book was delighful, I could not wait to get to the end for the conclusions. Much to my disappointment there are no endings! you are left handing. My balloon was burst."
3,Great stories ... but,"Where is the conclusion? When I got the the four short stories of Dublin short stories, I was like, ok, I'll get back to the Lilac Bus ~~ and never did. It just left me hanging.Maeve Binchy is a great writer ~~ she tells stories like no other writer does but this book did not do her justice at all. The stories in the Lilac Bus seems to be incomplete. There were no conclusion at all. Maybe she intends to leave the endings up to our imaginations ~~ but she barely even started a sketch with some of these characters. And I want to know more.It feels like a tease ~~ come on and read my book but, ... you have to do the rest on your own.This is not my favorite Binchy book ~~ not even close. Since I have read her other books, I know that this is not her typical writing. Don't be discouraged if you read this book ~~ she does have other books that are better.11-25-03"
5,Holy Smoke,"I'm a fairly fit middle-aged woman, I run and exercise regularly. It was a shock to discover that I had to work UP to the easy versions of these exercises...yow! Loving it, Jackie is fantastic. My only beef is that the exercises are not performed to the rhythm of the music which goofs you up sometimes but that's a small thing."
4,15 minutes and you will sweat!,"I did the standing work-out and 2 days later my abs are still sore! Jackie's interactions with the other actors seem forced at times but the moves are legit. She doesn't spend a ton of time teaching form, so plan on the first few times taking it slower than her counts and watching the moves. But I promise, you will feel this for days afterwards. I prefer this to Jillian Michaels 6 weeks to a 6 pack DVD, as I think the moves focus more on your core than Jillian does."
2,Be careful with your lower back,"I was really excited about trying out this DVD. Being a fairly active and flexible person -running and doing yoga regularly, I was looking to add some ab routines to strengthen the core. In my first standing abs session, I pulled my back. Now I'm trading the DVD in for something else. Should've listened to the warning bell in my head when I saw that weights are used with the rapid movements of legs and arms. It's hard to maintain good form when the movements are so fast."
3,Good tips but a bit short,"This Extreme ABS workout by Jackie is just okay. Couple of the moves actually make me feel dizzy. But perhaps doing it few more times might change what I thought about it. Compare to Jackie's Circuit Training, this one is kind of weak. I highly recommend her Circuit Training. It is a lot of fun, it targets more muscles groups including ABS. You will get your money worth just getting that DVD instead."
5,Xtreme Abs by Jackie Warner,"I will keep this short and sweet. This dvd is amazing. I purchased her book and am following her program. I am not nor was i ever over weight. I always had a bloated looking mid section. I just wanted to get toned and ripped and in great shape. This dvd alone you will see results in a week or 2. You will be sweating and huffing but its well worth it. When you mix it with her other workouts to keep your body guessing and her book. Its a life style change. I am happier, less depressed, less stressed and because im not eatting bad foods anymore im not as irritable. Im just so much happier with myself and it shows through new confidence and self respect. I recommend this dvd and the whole Jackie Program for anyone who wants to step up and change their life style to better themselves. It makes you look at life a whole different way. HAPPY, HEALTHY, and may i say LOOKING DAMN GOOD!"
1,Hated it.,"I really wanted to works on my abs- a problem spot for me like most women. I also have a back injury which also make it important to work my core regularly. A friend recommended Jackie and I bought this and another DVD from her. I tried this one first. I hated it. I knew trying it for the first time it would be difficult. I have never seen any of her workouts but after about the 10th time in the first 10 minutes that she said how easy these exercises were for her and how she could do them all day long, I turned it off. Who cares if they are easy for her? Is that supposed to motivate me? She said""hate me now, love me later"". Well I tried it long enough for the first part."
2,fuzzies,Not the book I was looking for. It came in good shape although a little later than I had expected.
1,No instructions.,"I got this for my daughter's 7th ice cream themed birthday party. Opened it a couple days before to see if I needed to buy anything extra and there were no instructions. It included packets of cocoa powder, sprinkles, syrups, a flimsy measuring cup and plastic ziplock bags. You can go online to teacher sites and find instructions for making ice cream in ziploc bags with your own ingredients/supplies. Without the instructions intended for these particular packets, its useless to me. The Scientific Explorer website has been down for weeks so I can't even contact them for instructions. :("
5,A complete accessible text,"In Jewish Spirituality: A Brief Introduction For Christians, Rabbi Lawrence Kushner assists members of the Christian community to better understand Judaism in general, and basic Jewish concepts of spirituality in particular. In a complete accessible text, Rabbi Kushner explores how we are all connected to each other and to God, how the Torah is a blueprint for all of creation, how ""holy deeds"" are required every day by each of us in order to successfully mend the world, the nature of God's ""Oneness"", how the Jewish experience of teshuva is similar to the Christian experience of Jesus, and a great deal more. Rabbi Kushner also dispels a number of misconceptions about Judaism common among Christians. Jewish Spirituality is an enthusiastically recommended introduction for those with Christian backgrounds who are seeking a better understanding of Judaism and its relation to their own Christian faith from a Jewish perspective."
3,Not deep enough,"I was really excited when I ordered the book, but it quickly disappointed. The chapters only average 2 pages; not giving enough time to introduce any real concepts or discussion points. The rabbi only touches on the surface of his topics without fully developing his arguments, especially on subjects that are unorthodox, as far as Christian beliefs and understanding. I was just looking for more from it."
5,A true Rock-n-Roll Album!,"Rock music does not get much more sincere then American Caesar! This album has each track centered around the most important instrument of rock, the electric guitar. If you didn't think twice, you may think you're listening to an old Stooges album. Each track has that same sincerity and passion that The Stooges albums did. After trying to run from his reputation with The Stooges by self-exile in Berlin, Pop returns to his musical roots with American Caesar. You never know where Iggy will turn to next. This time Iggy turned to the past for answers. And he found them in all the right places. Every track is a great piece of music. But my personal favorites would have to be ""Mixin' The Colors"", ""Wild America"", ""Highway Song"", ""Plastic & Concrete"", and ""F___in' Alone""."
4,Pooh's DVDs,This is an excellent collection of Pooh's DVDs for kids. They will love wathing it again and again.
4,Great book. Tells the truth about the courts.,"Judge Rothwax does a Howard Cossell and, ""tells it like it is."" See how some really brainless court decisions have fouled up our legal system and given every advantage to the people we need off the street. If you don't want to know what's wrong with the criminal justice system in this country don't read this book"
1,Total Garbage!,"I received a copy of ""Dark Moon"" directly from the authors as I gave David Percy and his assistant a tour of the Goldstone tracking facility and was interviewed on camera by David in December of 1997.I worked at the Goldstone Manned Space Flight Network station during all Apollo missions and was an eyewitness to those events. However this book is filled with half-truths and total fabrications about the Apollo program. It will only be of interest to people who like things about ""Area 51,"" ""Crop Circles,"" Roswell ""UFO's"" and other weird ""happenings.""Anyone who has even the slightest knowledge of photography and physics can see through the so-called ""facts"" presented in this fabrication. It should be considered a work of fiction instead of an independent view of a historic event.Bill Wood, Retired Tracking Systems Engineer, Barstow, CA"
1,They have got to be kidding!,"A friend gave me a copy of ""Dark Moon"" to read while I was on a cruise this winter. I thought it might be an entertaining and interesting read but instead I found it to be the dumbest read since ""Chariots of the Gods"". I consider myself to be fairly open minded but I would have to have lost my mind to believe anything they say in this book. It's quite obvious to any educated person that ""Dark Moon"" is just a lot of baloney. This book just goes to prove that people will say anything for money. Next thing you know, they'll say they've found a second lunar module on the grassy knoll! I'm glad I didn't pay for the book because I threw it in ocean."
5,"Evil Fun, Great New Flavor","For anyone worn out with the sheer poundage of rules to haul around and learn for a d20 game, this neat little system is quick to learn and has an interesting and compact set of skills and weaknesses that determine a character's abilities. The ability to demote the Gamemaster/Controller to player and take over is optional but makes for deliciously wicked fun."
1,Disappointing,"The product is advertised with a 3.75"" diameter heated surface. That is why I ordered it, since I do have other cup warmers, but I have some mugs with wide bases that do not fit on them. To my disappointment, it is not as advertised - the warming surface is 3.5"" across the entire black (heated) part, and only 3.25"" across the flat USABLE part of the heated surface. I would have returned it, but it was so cheap the cost of returning it would be about 1/2 the cost of the refund. So it is in the closet as a replacement for when one of my other mug warmers wears out - and I'm very disappointed."
5,best of the bunch,my wife likes HOT tea and likes to keep it that way-- this does just that. It is the best of the lot.
2,"Define ""warm"".","I can only hope that I'll get at least a comment or two from someone explaining just how warm is ""warm"" when defined by the many positive reviews here. I'm wondering because I just received this cup warmer the other day and, having tested it with three different mugs, have yet to experience it's value.First of all, the warmer arrived with it's packaging opened (inside the sealed Amazon shipping box) and the cord was clearly 'unprofessionally' wound up and tied, suggesting to me that I received someone's returned model. That said, the plate gets hot, so I don't see that it is defective. Perhaps another purchaser had the same reaction to this item as I.I guess I'm not sure what I should have expected. Should this keep my coffee hot, or should I just expect that, by ""warmer"", it prevents the coffee from turning ice cold but only to luke warm (I gave it 2 stars because it keeps it about 20% warm)."
3,Beverage Warmer,"The warmer keeps beverages luke warm, but not hot. The warmer is okay, but I prefer my beverages to be kept hot."
4,Does the job,This coffee warmer really does the job. Keeps the coffee nice and warm. I have had several different warmers over the years and this one so far is the best. If you are looking for a warmer that keeps the liquid as hot as it was in the pot you might be disappointed. Don't think any of them will do that.
3,"Works well, cord/switch placement is terrible","Keep your cube warm all weekend with this since you'll probably leave it on frequently. The switch is on the short power cord meaning you'll have to get a hernia crawling under your desk every time you want to change from on to off. There's a little light that's not very bright to remind you it is on, but you won't notice, especially if your work area is properly lit.It does keep your drink warm. That's what its supposed to do. Yay!"
2,Not impressed,"After reading a number of reviews, this warmer sounded like is was great. I took it to work, plugged it in, waited for it warm up, put a steaming hot cup of coffee on it. It didn't keep the coffee hot or warm. This item kept my drink tepid at best. I was very disappointed. Perhaps mine was a lemon... I wouldn't recommend it if you want to keep your drinks warm."
4,Needed to finish my collection,"I watched this movie a long time ago and figured I would buy part 2. So, I had to buy part 1. The second one is still my favorite from the two."
5,love this movie series,love these movies very much. I love alexis biebel and america ferrea. I would def recommend getting BOTH movies. I loved the second the best I think
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,"This gives young people a comfort to know that there are actually friendships out there that are more important then zits and boys. (Unlike say, Mean Girls.) This is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer for those girls who would so willingly give up everything for their friends.Also, you get to see some awsome shots of beautiful Greece with Lena and that handsome Kostos. See spectacular shots made by that hot soccer star, Bridget. Also featuring commical footage of Tibby at Walmans. And watch as Carmen throws a rock through a window! AWSOME, right?And Tibby's suckumentary also featured on this disk. Now THAT is a documentary worth seeing!"
3,Boring compared to the book!,"If you've read the book then you would know that it was a really really good book! And you would think that the movie would be too, no offense it was great and all but, they still left out lots of important parts like Carmens mom gets remaired and has a baby, Lena goes to Greece with her sister two times then her Bapi dies and Kostos comes to America, and Tibby's sister falls out of a window! It was a great movie but they left out some very exiting parts! I recomend the book!"
4,You Will Love It,I give it 4 stars because i thought it was a really cute and if I were you I would buy it when it come out it a total girl movie for all you boys.
2,Knockoff!!!!,The item listed is a knockoff. It barely qualifies as a wallhanger. I sent 2-3 emails to Dreamobjects and asked this very question and received no response.
5,Great music for great times....,"I loved Vol. 1....I really love Vol. 2. This is the best music for all settings: a cool-out session, a family gathering, a long drive, or a throw-down party. Each cut holds its own. And for those of us just a little past the Hip Hop lyrics phase, but still ""cool"" enough to dig the beats....it's a must have. Go get it...JJ"
3,A useful book,"The author considers many aspects of ""Mixed Matches"" covering how we feel about and deal with ourselves, our partners, family, friends, strangers and finally our children.The approach is mostly to quote annecdotal material from situations that illustrate the point the the author wishes to make. These are then followed by his personal, rather ""folksy"" advice.The style will not appeal to all readers and especially, it may not be so effective at helping a relationship once problems have become entrenched.However, as a book to read before this happens, it is very useful. I'd stronlgy recommend it to anyone in the early stages of a mixed relationship. It will prepare you for some of the trials ahead and you will be much better equipped to deal with them."
3,A trilogy let down,"This is the third book in a trilogy started by Where The Cangewinds Blow. The first book was thrilling to the point that I chased down the next 2 books for 7 years. The second book was decent it kept the story going. The third was a bit of a let down. The books are conected and one must read all three if they have begun. the Author seems to have lost his original train of thought. In the first book he writes like its a thrilling Sci Fi book and the second book just picks up threads where he left it, but the third while continueing the thread seems to become somewhat like a Fable in that it carries with it a moral. In my opinion the moral should have been left out though it mat speak to some teenage girls."
5,Brilliant,"Both volumes of this set are excellent. This is the way literary biography should be done. It's so good, in fact, that you wouldn't necessarily have to be a huge Nabokov fan to want to read both books. (Of course, I am a diehard Nabokovian, so I raced through them even more eagerly.) Bravo to Brian Boyd."
4,Beautiful,I haven't used it yet but it is really beautiful and has a nice weight -- not flimsy at all.
4,Picture is Misleading,"Hey, great product. Fantastic product. Just be sure to read that it is only one pie pan even though the picture shows two. I thought I was getting two. I would rate five star if they had a more accurate picture."
4,"Interesting, I guess",It is a pretty good book.. a little boring. Some of the chapters seem to go on a little longer than they need to.
3,Difficult read,"It was a necessary book for the statistics class, I found theclass very stressfull and that may explain why I'm not so warmedup to the book. I thought a lot of things could have been simplifiedand explained in 'plainer' English."
1,Gabriel G63607 shocks,"Ordered 2 shocks. Both boxes were old, ripped up and open. One shock was very rusty on the outside. Items looked like customers returns or store returns that have been on selves for years."
3,Let down by poor production.,"Well written, but the publisher has let the author down with a poor index and even a poor table of contents that lacks subheadings, making it hard to look up previous definitions. Also black text on a stippled grey background was a poor choice for code listings (just a box around them would have been fine). And some of the code examples in the ADO chapter are sloppy."
5,Its a revised version of goku's dragonball saga.,"There's nothing here of Goku's origin that a die hard fan hasn't seen before in one general form or another but the story is well done. Goku's origin has been revised and simplified. This revised saga is exciting and the script is very tight. The animation is GREAT!, far superior to typical dragonball animation. It is truly a movie that is animated. The camera angles used, pans and shots are just like a live movie. I really enjoyed this movie."
5,Excellent \m/\m/,"From the cover art to the amazing music contained here, Nominon deliver the metal goods an all fronts. Amazing band, amazing album! \m/"
2,"Potboiler, moves along but very unlikely","This is a historical naval book with a lead character much like Alistair MacLean heroes - obstinate, insubordinate, convinced he's smarter than anyone else, declamatory, and full of action. The novelist has his character speaking in little cliches to himself - in for a penny in for a pound Halfhyde! The action progresses well and the historical setting, as far as I can tell, is accurate. Battle sequences are stirring, but all in all .... The entire finish of the book hangs on a monstrous coincidence between nature starting her battle at the same time that the Japanese fire their guns. Unbelievable, and a bit too coy, also bad geology."
4,this is ok If you like pegasus's toon world card this is for you,The first episode is shining friendship (ps. i have this on vhs so it may have more episodes on dvd) its about yugi had lost to kaiba in the last episode and has lost all hope of saving his grandpas soul from pegasus mai offers her starchips because she has extras yugi is to shocked to duel so tea steps in will she be able to win those starchips for yugi??? next its a two episode battle Kaiba vs. pegasus for his brothers soul pegasus is wiping the floor with kaiba with his toon world card and his ability to read minds then Kaiba forfeits his hand and puts his cards upside down so pegasus cant see his cards in his mind then kaiba picks on card from his hand and lays it down ITS A BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON but will kaiba be able to defeat the toon world monsters or will pegasus finish him off with kaibas own virus deck infection card?
3,Ok,Arrived in time but I was bit disappointed with the context of it. I though it would've been more interesting
1,"Very Poor, Rick Black's books are by far better!","Sorry about the bad review, but the truth hurts. I like every other hunter now days am a Big fan of Iowa's wildman Rick Black and his line of outdoor books. I will stick with Rick. For the deer hunter I reccemend the following by Black"" Bag Em and Tag Em, Venison cookbook, The dead deer cookbook, and Cookin' with beer, If your a redneck like me then you will love TRAILER TRASh COOKIN' (A VERY FUNNY BOOK)"
4,Garry and his wild adventures!,Woodsong is a intersting book to read if you are into adventures. Garry has a team of dogs. He runs them on some land in their back yeard. He trained the team. He gets in some really interesting runs.He also gets in a really funny one. He gets three sodas. Thay EXPLODE because thay are so cold. One of the dogs gets frost bite. So he is in the sled. He gets some on his booties. When he runs with the other dogs he is sucking on his booties when he is running. That is the funniest in the race....
5,Not just for teens,"This is one of my all-time favorite books ! When my family first read it, we lived in the suburbs of Chicago with a pet cat. After reading Woodsong we were so inspired that we moved to Minnesota and now keep 20 sled dogs which we race. Although we can't attribute all of our lifestyle changes directly to Paulsen's book, it certainly was a strong influence. I would recommend it without reservation to any one who wants to broaden their horizons."
5,love it!! simple instructions and beautiful projects,It's a great introducion to cross stitch to hardanger and is written very simply. The projects are lively and colorful. Explaination of techniques is wonderful and i have this book next to me as i stitch for refference.a great buy i checked it out at my library first and fell in love with it so i bought it.
4,SHONEN KNIFE 101,"Urban legend has it that if THE MONKEES had gender reassignment surgery, wore colorful matching jumpers, ditched the goofy one and moved to Japan they'd be SHONEN KNIFE. I, however, beg to differ. Consider the evidence. Would those 60's relics be able to come up with eleven jamming tunes that would have you rocking and smiling at the same time? Would Davey and company be even remotely genius enough to swipe a killer riff from JUDAS PRIEST'S ""LIVING AFTER MIDNIGHT"" and fracture it into a loving tribute to brown mushrooms? Surely, I think not!!!Get the knife and see the light!!!"
4,Greek: Enjoy the college and the parties,"This dvd contains the first ten episodes of Greek's first season.I don't know about this show until I watvhed a promo on tv. I watched the pilot and I hooked up into the series.Great characters, to love theme, to hate them. Rusty, Casey, Ashleigh, Cappie, Evan, Rebecca, Dale, Frannie...You'll see the dilemmas between the boys and girls inside the Cyprus Rhodes University. Oh, and the confrontations between their fraternities and sororities: Omega Chi, Kappa Tau, Zeta Beta Zeta..."
3,Pretty good show but it doesn't properly portray life,"While one understands that this show has to be entertaining in order to survive I believe that it doesn't properly showcase what being a member of a Fraternity/Sorority is about. While there is quite a bit of truth behind the antics of the characters it seems that it is overdone... almost to an ""Animal House"" level."
5,Track Listing,"CD has 4 versions of Thinking of You - Pete Devereux & the Wideboys Club Vocal Remix, The Wideboys Remix, Almighty 7' remix and Kinky Boys remix edit."
4,Great Beatles inspired Brit-pop,Excellent Beatles-esque pop tunes with catchy hooks and a decent amount of variety. Phillips has an interesting voice and the musicianship on the album is fantastic (Colin Moulding's pop bass lines are worth the price of the album alone). Definitely underrated (the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the last couple songs at end of the album are a bit weak).
3,Good Listen but Not A Top Pick,"I bought this album after hearing one of her songs on a movie soundtrack. The CD is good, but I wouldn't rank it very high. It has only two standouts on the entire album, ""Baby I can't Please you"" is the best. It's now collecting dust on my bookshelf. Spend your money on something else."
5,Good album!!!,"If your a fan of Cream or a fan of Gary Moore you will like this album! Great songs ,great guitar.I recommend it!"
5,Guitar Virtuosity,"My main interest is Gary Moore's talent and sound. I had read that he was kind of reigned in on this album so I hadn't added it to my collection. Then I heard a little of the album on utube and he certainly was not inhibited from his usual expression and technique, so much passion and ability. I've been listening to it alot and am so glad I bought it! Never really followed Jack Bruce that much, no reason for that,, just didn't. He has a great voice. They sound really good together. For me, it's more exciting than Cream ever was. Maybe it was the times...Would recommend to everyone who has an ear for great guitar playing, maybe the best ever!"
4,CREAM II - deja vu,"Except for the Gray Moore songs, this album sounds like a Cream reunion, Some of the songs were a little too close to Cream melodies for my taste.Baker and Bruce have not lost much with age. Bruce's voice still has that same haunting edge that he had with Cream and although Baker does not do any Toad drum solos on this album, he can still keep a beat.Although Clapton would have been interesting to hear on this album, Gary Moore does a nice job. Although Moore's staccato style of playing is quite different than Clapton's, the dude can play and doesn't have to play second fiddle to anyone (Gary Moore - RIP).Three great songs - Sittin' on top of the World, The World Keeps on Turning, and Where in the World.I hope to see Baker and Bruce team up with someone else in the near future.Even though this album often sounds like Cream (too close for comfort), I highly recommend this album for blues and blues rock fans."
4,American's beware,"don't get it if you are american because you simply won't understand it.p.s. Why oh Why did you american's try and do your own version of ""the office"" just leave it to the masters of comedy"
3,Funny,"This movie came out before Bruno, before Borat, before Madagascar. This is the same character Sacha Baron Cohen played in the Ali G Show, but unlike the talk show this is very funny. Kind of outrageous, kind of clever, kind of dumb. Borat makes a cameo appearance."
3,"Pretty good, but I'm not British","I'm sure if you've lived in England and have seen the people that Ali G is making fun of, then this movie would be several times more hilarious. However, I still enjoyed it a lot. It helps to have a working knowledge of the way Parliament is set up...."
1,not nearly as good as the tv shows,"I originally saw the British TV show which was nothing short of tremendious! I thorouhly recommend any of your buyers with a PAL/NTSC and region free dvd player to buy them on amazon.co.uk, pick up Bling Bling or Aiii. The HBO series recycles a lot of the sketches, some are better some are not, great guests though..No matter which side of the pond you're from, the movie is a distant third place, very disappointing. Avoid."
2,Rather vulgar really,"I always liked the TV show in small doses. Very good for a little pubescent giggle.Though the feature film has it's moments, there are many borrowed jokes in there and it goes without saying that there is no plot line to speak of whatsover.If you can deal with or like somewhat immature humour then go for it otherwise I'd give it a miss."
2,Ali G Movie somewhat disappointing,"I had the opportunity to watch the series, as shown on HBO after the movie. Had I watched that first I would not have purchased the movie. I definitely felt that it could have been better. So my recommendation is skip the movie and purchase season 1 & 2 from HBO."
5,a must have!,"This TV Episode Fun Pack, Vol. 1 is a must have. My children love Sesame Street. They can watch it over and over."
4,Good but not Great,"Cuckoo picks up exactly where Doppleganger and Pubic Fruit left off. It's good to see a band stay true to their roots but sometimes i wish Curve would just record their ""Loveless"" and make us all happy. There is some really good material on here. ""Men are From Mars"" and ""Superblaster"" are sonic blasts of guitar and techno. ""All of One"" and ""Left of Mother"" are a nice tender addition to the Curve sound. I love Toni Halliday's voice and admire Curve for being independent. But can't help feeling they're not reaching their potential with Cuckoo."
1,"Here's the ""beef.""","My beef is: Why do so many artists/groups sound so much alike? Take ""Chinese Burn"" for example, from the CD ""Cuckoo"" by Curve. Like the person who sees their life pass before their eyes in the moment or two before their impending death, listening to the opening measures reminded me of a bunch of different genres/groups/songs---all at once.In essence, my musical life passed before my ears. More of the same [cringing]. Do I have to listen to the whole thing [frowning because I know I've never heard it before] again?Curve, apparently, is simply suffering from the same problem that ninety percent of all the other musicians and writers currently recording music are suffering from---lack-of-creativity-itis.Doing so much that has been done before, but much better, would be lovely. But they don't.And I don't give good ratings to music that, I'd swear, I've listened to in a dozen previous lives."
5,"Beautiful, vile and hammering record.","This is a beautiful, vile and hammering record. Three years of listening and still not bored."
2,It may be good if I could get the lumps out,"I have been disappointed with this product. We have always enjoyed Annie's products & have never had a problem, until now. The ""cheese"" was so solidly clumped that I was unable to make a sauce without lumps. I have used 3 different packages from my order & have had the problem with all of them. I am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse. Either way, beware."
2,I had to put down the book,"After I read that Yangzhou fried rice comes from Yangzhou, I'm starting to believe everything in Wikipedia is true.This was an invention in Hong Kong and despite if you travel to Yangzhou and it says it on the tourist material it is not true. I also question that Fujian has the best soups while if you travel to China most people will say the Cantonese have the best soups. You try and travel in China and ask anyone."
4,Not Too Bad..,"Not quite what I expected, but its not too bad its more for younger kids 4 & 5. Gives a bit of insight to the bible so thats a plus.."
2,Missing CD,I ordered this book that was supposed to come with the CD. The CD never arrived. Huge disappointment.
4,Her promising first solo venture...,"When Carleen finally went solo from the Young Disciples in '93 she crafted a disk that was based off the work with her former band mates. The album did vary with offerings of programmed acid Jazz ( 'Feet Wet Up', lead single 'Mama Said') and acoustic and live soul numbers like 'Ain't Givin' Up on You', 'Let it Last' and the emotively soulful 'Secrets'. It's the live sounding recordings that would eventually lead to her explorations on her sophmore venture 'Blessed Burden'. Carleen has a voice that ranks right up there with the greats. While the production comes from the second wave of jazz fusion recordings (early to mid 90's), her mature songwriting sets her apart. Her vocal delivery is truly unique and ripe with experience, it offers consolation and expresses emotions that few processed and marketed singers can only attempt. Her musical upbringing and experience with the J.B.s shines through. Sing on..."
3,just a travisty for true DBZ fans,Gohan is disguised as Saiya Man at the martial arts tournment. The whole gang is their even Goku is their and he's dead. The saiyans are not suposed to transform into super saiyan's so they won't be famous.
5,The book that started it all,"The first edition of Beyond Psychology introduced the world to Metapsychology for the first time back in 1988. The third edition, featured here, includes many revisions to the philosophical and practical aspects of the book. Beyond Psychology will always be of significance since it was the first book to codify the technique of Traumatic Incident Reduction (TIR). TIR has gone on to find many applications as a brief, one-on-one, non-hypnotic technique in such diverse groups as Vietnam veterans, domestic violence and motor vehicle accidents survivors. In short, anyone with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder can benefit from TIR and this book which describes the technique."
1,It doesn't work.,"When I TRY to play this game,there is a pop up that says it's encountered a problem & must close. Therefore, Ive never had a chance to play it."
2,Frustrating but challenging,"I finished Luxor and Amun Rising. Both were OK.I swear that in Luxor 2 the software makes it very difficult to win. I play at the normal level above Level 9. I have been so frustrated that I've smashed 4 mice. Now I buy a mouse with a replacement guarantee. Since I wrote this review I've upgraded my PC to Vista from XP. When I run Spy Ware software, it targets Luxor as Spy Ware and deletes most of the register data. I have to re-load it. Even so, it's not smooth. It runs erratically. My advice is, do NOT buy this for Vista!!! It won't work, even in Windows compatability mode."
5,An Absolute Must,"I simply could not put this fascinating and informative book down from beginning to end. It is an absolute must for anyone interested the ideas and protagonists in this drama. For an even deeper understanding see ""Culture of Critique"" by evolutionary psychologist Kevin MacDonald."
1,Uses a high mileage/intensity non-developmental approach.,"While coach Newton has done an amazing job of team-building and creating a winning tradition, he does so using workloads that may be counter-productive to an athlete's long-term development. He freely admits that his concern is how an athlete performs NOW, not later in the athlete's career."
2,"Yep, it fell apart on me...","Like many, I was initially quite happy with this product--I couldn't afford a Burley, and this was under $100 at Target. However, the trailer has slowly fallen apart on me. I leave it outside, but covered underneath a porch and in a mild, dry climate (California). The snaps tore out of the fabric after a month, which cannot be repaired. This means that the cover is only held in place by the velco. The front wheel (in stroller mode) is no longer near true, and jams at a 15-degree angle consistently. Worst of all, the 1-inch webbing that runs along the bottom of the seat has rotted through. I consider the trailer unusable now.The only reason I am not giving it one star is that it might hold up better if garaged and lightly used. The price is right, and the design is fine. The quality is simply poor."
4,Poor material but overall good cheap trailer,"This trailer is very good on price but the material could be better. Even with being careful not to rip the fragile nylon material, the areas around the snap fastener will seperate first then anywhere stress is put on it (i.e. straps). After about the 3rd time using it, I didn't grab the snap close enough, and pulled the nylon, and started to rip it until I caught myself. Did this on a couple different areas. Overall, it is very stable, very easy to connect to the hub, and you can ride at 15 mph on a smooth service with no worry about it tipping over. The hardest part about the setup is putting the hub on the rear wheel of your bike. Very easy to fold back up and hang up on a hanger in your garage."
4,INTERESTING!!!,This was the first time I had read an Eberhardt book and it definately won't be the last. The book kept me on the proverbial edge of my seat and was very well written with interesting and very developed characters!! The ending was a surprise!!
2,Fans of the original Tekkaman Blade don't need to watch this.,"All the characters in this anime are a bunch of annoying **icks, particularly Natasha. The original Tekkaman Blade, you felt the characters, you understood them, and the story was so deep. Tekkaman Blade II is nonsense, it's just more mech battles and about a military tekkeman academy. There was little point in why they were fighting other than your typical revenge, save the world crap. It gets repetitive, a lot of the characters become **icks especially Star, who makes a return as cheif of the tekkaman academy."
4,Laurell does well,"I read all of LKH's books, and like many other fans, am tiring of the constant sex. I have been a Star Trek fan since nursery school, and so I thought I'd give this book a try since it combines two of my favorite things. I have to say, Laurell did a great job with this book. It keeps to the Star Trek TNG characters and gives insight into how Deanna and Worf think. Sure, since this is Laurell's book, there is torture involved, but NO SEX! It is a nice breather from the Anita books. I recommend this to Star Trek TNG fans as well as Laurell fans."
4,Worf and Deanna solve a mystery,Worf and or Trai fans will like this novel that features both characters. Fairly typical STTNG premise and storyline.
3,Good but not great,"A good retelling of Winkle, but not a great one. The visuals are elementary and seemed a bit too much so for my middle school class. However, I enjoyed Angelica Houston's narration and she stays true to the written version by Irving."
1,"Keep this CD far, far from your home!",Don't waste your time or your money. What a bunch of mush. Steve Winwood unfortunately caught the Phil Collins bug. This CD went straight in the trash. Keep your eyes peeled for an album called When The Eagle Flies. It's hard to find but worth the trouble. Far From Home should not even be considered a Traffic CD. I would keep it as far from your home as possible.
2,Far from good,"It was not until after I had wasted my cash on this CD that I understood what was going on here. Winwood and Capaldi, apparently in need of some of our money, whipped out this mess and slapped the name Traffic on the cover. I didn't expect great things, afterall Traffic never came close to the heights of their much more talented but less appreciated peers Family. But being in a nostalgic mood, I at least thought this might be as good as ""When the Eagle Flies."" Wrong.I think the essential problem is that Capaldi sings and plays drums and Winwood sings and plays everything else. (As another reviewed noted, Traffic is in dire need of a reedman to flesh out the sound. A guitarist wouldn't hurt either, and I don't think Dave Mason is doing that much these days.) The result is a well-recorded CD with little spirit or verve. Sort of like a solo album by Winwood. Or one of his commercials...."
3,This is Traffic?,"I purchased this album in 1994, shortly after it was released. Although I like the album overall, it is not at all like Traffic albums of years past. The problem is that it sounds way too much like a Steve Winwood solo album; as a Traffic album, it comes up a bit short. For example, ""Riding High"", ""Here Comes A Man"", and ""Every Night, Every Day"" would sound much more appropriate on a Steve Winwood album. Even so, I like Winwood's solo work too, so this album to me is not as big of a disappointment as some might find it. The bottom line: Diehard Traffic fans should stick to the older material."
2,Hated the poetry,"For a story about an inspired poet, the poetry in this book was mediocre at best. I read it and re-read it trying to gain some insight. None to be gained. The name-dropping was obvious and the ""secret"" about Constance's affair with a married man was boring. Nothing happened in this book. No relationships developed. It was just a re-telling of something that had already happened with no present tension or build-up. For an amazing book, read the book ""Possession"" which is one of the book titles mentioned in ""Constance."""
2,The tortured heroine is not quite my thing.,"I did not like the tortured heroine concept, besides the pacing was sometimes slow and the ending was to easy to see coming."
4,error,"I just wanted to point out to the reader who thought the title was misspelled, that I'm sure the publisher and the author are aware of the correct spelling. However, I think that the title is supposed to be a play on words. Therefore, the spelling of FATAL is a representation of murder, in order to create a more dramatic effect for the book. I enjoy all of Ms. Cannell's books. I particularly enjoy the humorous aspects. I hope that she continues to delight her readers. Keep up the good work!P.S. Keep those originals titles coming! :-)"
3,"A Good Record...But, There Exist Much Better Trance Albums!","This record was released in April 2001 on label: Agitato Records and contains 8 melodic full-on trance tracks. The record is not bad at all but there is way too much of this sound out there sounding so much better than this thats why i only gave it 3 stars or else all my reviews will get 5 stars. But if you like music that works fine on raves with uplifting psychedelic sounds that takes you to places that never been visited then this is a buy for you. Or are you a collector/DJ in genres like: Goa Trance, Full-On Trance or Psychedelic Trance, this record should be in THAT collection."
5,One of the best Sunfire books!,Rachel was one of the first sunfire books I ever read and is by far one of my favorites. It is all about a Jewish immigrant who must choose between two men. The book is exciting and romantic.
3,"""Strong"" possbilities","Sinners and Saints delivers what it promises on the back cover. There are some good cameo performances, the shootouts are kickin' and Johnny Strong has a certain screen presence and believable charisma. The setting is perfect for the Code of Silence style screenplay and prerequisite car chases. It is hard to knock an earnest and gritty film like this that isn't trying to be more than it is. Six pack swilling weekend cinema fans get what they are looking for here. 3&1/2 stars."
1,Sinners and Saints,"For review purposes, I forced myself to watch the entire movie. Basically it is about a cop who is at the forefront of a turf war. With that being said, the motivations for this turf war between the gangs and the mercenaries is unclear. The movie never explains why the ""big"" man behind the killings is motivated to kill all the people that die in the movie. We learn why his main henchman is killing. He wants to get a tape that exposes himself to criminal activities.***SPOILER ALERT***The movie was so violent that the violence became the main plot. The acting was poor, and in the end almost every actor in the movie dies except the cop and the head bad guy. Most of the violence was gratuitous. The plot was confusing and the motivations of everyone besides the cop were unclear.This was one bad movie on so many levels.Save your money. Goodfellas has violence, but a decent plot. Watch that instead."
4,Really Good Action Flick!!,I really enjoyed this film. There was a lot of attention to detail as compared to alot of big buck action movies. I agree with the first couple of reviews more or less. You would be better off renting or buying this movie as opposed to most of the the high budget shoot em ups. The lead Actor Johnny strong does a great job and was a solid lead character actor. I really hope to see more of him in the future. This film was a lot of fun to watch and my wife even really liked it (which is rare for a lower budget film as she is very picky). Granted there is nothing really new in this film but it was all actually done very well. Some of the editing is a little sketchy but overall It was a really good effort. Highly recommended.
3,"If you like guns and violence, then this is the movie for you","My husband and I sat down to watch this movie not really knowing what to expect. The back of the box promised a ""an action-packed thriller about cops and killers, loss and redempion, SINNERS and SAINTS."" One thing is for sure, it does have a lot of action, cops, killers, and loss....not so much on the redemption (in my opinion). This movie is very violent and gory, there are several very sqeamish torture scenes. The story line was ok, but it took me a little ways into the movie to be able to keep track of everything. I am admittedly not a huge fan of uber-violent films, so this wasn't one that I enjoyed personally. My husband enjoys action movies more than I do, and he enjoyed the movie, but not enough that he would watch it again. I did not enjoy the movie, and I would not watch it again."
3,Whoever laid this book out should be fired!,There is lots of good information in this book; but it is the most infuriating to use book that I can ever recall. I'm tempted to cut it apart and take it to Kinkos to have the put the pages into a spiral binder. If they ever reprint it I hope they do it as a conventional book with a conventional spine.
4,Broadening my vistas of knowledge,"Nice and quick introduction to the field of geology. I fancy that I can go hiking through the mountains in upstate New York, have Ms Bjornerud's book with me, and pretend I can read the rocks. I learned lots about how we can understand the earth and ourselves from reading the rocks.Some of the earlier reviews were critical of her opinions; perhaps that's justified, perhaps not. I enjoyed the book for what she had to share with us.If you have even a smidgen of interest in geology, you need look no further for a great introduction--at least in my humble opinion.I gave four stars only because I reserve 5 stars for the likes of ""War and Peace"" and such."
3,pretty good incense,"Pretty good incense. For the price, very good incense. I usually buy smokeless Japanese incense that is excellent. Got this on a whim. I'm pleased. I bet you will be too."
1,NOT MADE IN THE USA!!!!,"What a bummer. With the down turn in the economy, im always looking for ""made in the USA"" products and companies to support. I was pretty excited to find this highly rated caulk gun. But, embossed in large letters on the handle says ""Made in UK"". however there is a small piece of paper that says ""assembled in Michigan"". very different!Regardless, I'm disappointed in the false advertisement with the intention to mislead consumers like myself. shame on you!!"
2,Body Mother F***in' Count's Worst Album!,"This follow up to Body Count is a weaker album. ""Born Dead"" and ""Necessary Evil"" are standouts."
4,What a trip down memory lane!,"I loved Free To Be You and Me as a child and I love it now as an adult looking back. As a young girl in the 70s, Free To Be taught me that girls could be anything they want and broke stereotypes for ALL children. It taught us all that are feelings were important and singing was a cure for just about anything. I love this DVD, but I am sad that they couldn't find room for Carol Channing and some of the others on the original record (found on the cd). This DVD is a must-have!"
5,one bad ... show,"i love this show. i wish it whould come out on dvd because i really miss it. i whould buy copies for my friends and family because they whould really enjoy it.it has everything a show needs humor,action,dramma,and fast cars."
2,Defect in Pilot episode,"There is a problem with disc 1 side A at 1:22:56. It occurs right when Sonny glares at Wheeler while they are sitting in the car. The picture freezes for half a second and then resumes. More disconcerting though is that after playing it a few times, the video would freeze for a few seconds and then skip to where Calderone reaches for the gun in his waistband. I could no longer position the disk anywhere in the skipped area. Reinserting the disk did not fix the problem (this is on a high-end Sony player). On a DVD player from a different manufacturer, the DVD gets a media read error at the problem spot.I returned the DVD set as defective and got another one. The freeze again occurs at 1:22:56. It resumes, but I'm worried the disk will eventually exhibit the skip problem. I also don't like that this defect occurs just before my favorite part of the episode, when ""In the Air Tonight"" plays while Sonny and Rico are driving.How widespread is this problem?"
5,The Brits are waiting ...!!!,"Miami Vice defined an era (ie the 80's) and to own the set on DVD would be superb. As far as I'm concerned this series has yet to be equalled in the 20 years since it was first aired. (I'm beginning to feel old now !) Come on Universal, get your finger out, we've all been waiting far too long !!"
3,miami vice on dvd,"TV1 has released a 2CD set of Miami Vice which starts with the pilot and continues with the Colderone story arc. It's a great reminder of how, unlike so many other shows, a happy ending was never guaranteed. Despite the slick production, this made MV slightly more real for me. The DVD footage is TV quality, ditto the sound. I had forgotten just how large some of the logic leaps are in the show. Supporting casts' fashion has not dated well, but the film-clip style remains intact. Hopefully this is a tester and enough customer support might swing a full-season, remastered release. It appears other shows are receiving similar treatment: Knightrider, A-Team, Magnum PI... MV's my pick of the bunch though."
5,"Some folks are ""Trekkies"" - I'm a ""Vicie""","Why Miami Vice hasn't been released on DVD is a mystery. There are a lot of ""Vicies"" like myself, who know every episode (in order), and know from which episode the music was scored. Doesn't matter how many times one has seen it, each episode still intrigues. Thankfully, TNN still runs an episode a day, but WE NEED DVD!!! (And like a previous reviewer, the clothes were fantastic - elegant, stylish & should still be worn by any woman who likes to make an impression.)"
2,Great Content Lousy Quality,"I loved this show when it originally aired, and really enjoyed wathing the episodes again on DVD, but the overall experience has been somewhat spoiled by the quality of the pressing/burning of the discs themselves. I've run these discs on 3 different DVD players and have had problems with sound drop out, picture pixellation and difficulty trying to jump to specific episodes from the index (all after making sure that the discs themselves were absolutely clean and free of scratches)."
1,Shocked! No Star Here!,"That anyone would let a child watch a movie that involves worshiping idols, definately not for Christian Familys!"
1,mean-spirited & scary,"we saw this movie with several other parents and the kids found it scary. the movie on the whole was mean spirited. the parents yell at their daughter before being turned into to pigs and she is entered into slavedom and must save her parents and everyone is mean, ugly and nasty to each other. hardly a happy family movie. Maybe ok for adults although it was not my cup of tea but I certainly would not recommend it for kids. everyone was complaining about as they left the theater. I'll stick with monsters, inc., ice age, shrek, spirit are all better family fare."
5,Best animated movie in a long time,I saw this movie in the theaters and I was blown away by it. Then I bought the movie a few days later and now I can watch it whenever I want. To me this doesn't seem at all like a Disney film and I don't even know why Disney was a part of the filmmaking process. Spirited Away is way better than Princess Mononoke and well worth your time to go see. Anime rocks!!
5,Awesome,"I got it fast, it plays great, i love it and thank you for it :) It was well packaged and I will probably buy from you guys again."
3,This movie was 50-50,"I know that this was the most disturbing cartoon i have ever seen. That ghost really was freaky. I would probly say maybe see this film but I would not recommend it. It's really exiting but not very well on the ""not freaky."" I watched the other stuff on the Dvd and Mizaki had good ideas. A good plot has a good finish but I did not think that this movie had one. I mean turning perants into pigs is not bad its just disturbing. A good movie has more than this cartoon competitor, and I think so too."
5,I have watched this movie 3 times and it's wonderful!,"As an avid Anime viewer, I rent many titles for myself and my kids since we all love anime. I've watched many anime films over the years and this one was the best. The colors, the animation was spectacular.Do yourself a favor and just rent it. Never mind what the few haters out there think. Think for yourself."
4,a dancing breeze,"spirited away, despite being anime (one of my pet hates), is a great movie. filled with childish charm, its gives you warm-fuzzies without disney sentimentality"
2,Overrated,"I'm a huge fan of Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli, but I'm sorry this one is not as good (by far) as others he's done.Animation is feeble and clunky at times, and the story... well, the story is not only mostly pointless (in the sense of not having a point) but also gets lost easily along the way with too many stuff going on. Most people won't even get what the movie is about.I'm glad that he finally got some recognition, but it's a shame it had to be with this movie. You're far better off watching some of the older movies from Miyazaki. Laputa, Kiki, Totoro, Princess Mononoke or my personal favourite Porco Rosso... Even the quite old Nausicaä holds better than this Spirited Away."
5,this is a cool movie :-),i first heard of this film on film 2001 johnathan ross said U MUST SEE THIS MOVIE and ever since i've been going down my local video store and saying 'im gonna rent that when i get the money' but i never did ... untill a couple of weeks ago i decided i will ... and i wasnt disapointed i thought it was a awesome film and now i bought it ... i loved it every anime fan should have this movie in their collection :-)
5,"I was certainly ""Sprited Away"" . . .heh heh . . . you can hit me for that . . .","This and Princess Mononoke are the two best animated films I have ever seen. This is a film I would happily watch with the kids over and over. Of course, being a Miyazaki film, it's beautiful. That's a given. And what everyone has said is true: it IS like a Japanese Alice in Wonderland. But I love Alice in Wonderland, so a Japanese version (which, storyline wise, is just as creative and still different in many ways) is fine by me. It's like nothing in American theatres, so it will feel completely fresh while your watching it. It's a masterpiece."
3,Vastly Over-rated,"For someone who loves animation a great deal, I sat through this movie greatly puzzled at the praise heaped upon it and its box-office takings. Yes, it has some strange and wonderful imagery, but come on! So has tons of other Japanese and Chinese animated features. Plus, the story is so plodding, and at times confusing, that my partner started nodding off half way through the movie. For a vastly superior and more entertaining animated feature in the same vein, I greatly recommend Tsui Hark's 1997 animated remake of ""A Chinese Ghost Story"". With its strange fantasy world of gods, demons, ghosts and timeless love, ""A Chinese Ghost Story"" is a great deal more engaging than the sleep-inducing ""Spirited Away""."
1,Just another discontented viewer!!,"I'd just as soon have given this no stars at all! I read all the great reviews and I was SO looking forward to watching this DVD but, oh my, even making allowances for cultural differences, this was a total drag. I found many of the characters irritating, the plot (?was there a plot) went every which way, and I didn't think the animation was so very spectacular. (No I wasn't expecting Disney or even Don Bluth - but I thought it would be better that it was somehow.) Well.... you can't please everybody. I'm just not that hard to entertain as a rule. (Please know that the last movie I absolutely hated was in 1971!!!) I'm glad that so many people seem to have gleaned so much pleasure from this flick. I'm only sorry I wansn't one of them!"
1,Let's just get one thing straight...,"A lot of you have been calling this an anime title. It is, but it isn't. I think Disney realized how popular anime was getting here in the States, and decided to try to make some cash off of it by putting their name on the product.DO NOT USE THIS MOVIE AS A JUDGEMENT FOR OTHER ANIME!Traditional anime, produced by companies like ADV Films, Pioneer, Bandai, and Anime Works (Which I'm doubting any of you have heard of if you consider SA to be ""great anime.""), is what you really should be looking for if you want to try anime.There are great anime titles out there, for all ages... if your kids really want to watch anime, there's Pokemon and the like. But parents turning into pigs and a vomiting... thing... is really more suitable for kids a little older than what this movie was targeted at.But since I doubt any of you care... then by all means, watch it. It's your loss."
4,Clever yet no Princess Mononoke,"It is my assumption that this movie has sold so much because so many people have seen Princess Mononoke on video and expected alot.The movie is alright by my standards, but is more of a kid film. The animation is better than Princess Mononoke, but I think it falls short in terms of action.You can read the plot synopsis anywhere. A girl gets trapped in a magical land after moving and such. For those of you who haven't seen it... Don't expect an action movie like Princess Mononoke. This movie barely has any action(mabye a dragon scene for 2 seconds), and it is more of a kid film. Still, if you don't particularly care about action and just want to watch something, have fun."
4,touching,"The filn starts slowly... typically the father and mother are annoying from the first scene and remain that way. Dont let this stop you. Chihiro is a guiding light and keeps you stuck to the screen no matter how utterly sweet and innocent the animated character might be.Set in a world that only japanese anime could provide, the movie engulfs your imagination. Its one of the first family style animated movies ive watched and it left me dumfounded with its timely heart felt approach and its sincerity. Never once did i think that chihiro thought twice about the trust she gave people. its not manufactured which is a very rare sight these days and one you expect least from an animated feature.All i can say is watch this movie for yourself. it will touch you, if it doesnt then you are beyond help and fair game for anyone to take a swing at. it is worth the time."
4,Gripping (May Not Be For All Audiences),"I felt very moved by Mrs. Revell's story, and I loved her use of hymn lyrics throughout the book. They married very nicely with her narrative to paint a picture of her journey toward faith in the midst of struggle and God's faithfulness to her throughout some very difficult circumstances. It's a memoir in the truest sense, and as with everything where someone is sharing painful details of past events, this book may not be appropriate for every reader. But if you are someone who is looking for a reminder that God can work good things out of bad experiences, this is a great place to turn. By the end, I felt like Glenda was a sweet and humble friend."
1,Tin Spitoon,"Writer-director Ron Shelton's mediocre comedy about golf pro Roy ""Tin Cup"" McAvoy (Costner) losing his swing and needing it to be rekindled by the lover of his chief rival (Rene Russo and Don Johnson.)A mediocre screenplay with cheap comedic quips that allude to nothing except the impotence of the male characters and the incompetence of whoever wrote this frivolous screenplay. The story being generic and utterly predictable is the only comedy in this film. The best part of the film is probably Cheech Marin palying McAvoy's friend/caddie, Romeo Posar. Unless you like brainless humor marked by stupid one-liners uttered by jock characters, stay away from this film."
3,Better than expected... relaxed fun,"I rented this DVD on a whim. I'm not a golfer, but you don't need to be in order to enjoy this little film. It's obvious how things will turn out from early on, but it really doesn't matter. The cast is solid and the film is fun, even if the plot contains few surprises.There's lots of fun one-liners, a good musical score, and a good transfer. The DVD lacks many features, but it does have both widescreen and pan-and-scan. I have to say you lose a LOT if you watch the pan-and-scan, golf courses are WIDE places."
5,This is a great comedy!,"Come on people, this is a comedy. Comedies in general, are far-fetched and ludicrous, and this fits both. This movie is great, Costner finally made a film that people actually will watch. He is great, but Cheech and Renee are equally as good, if not better. It was refreshing to see a Costner movie that was not 3 hours long, and was enjoyable to watch (unlike Waterworld, The Postman, etc.). People read too much into comedies these days, last time I checked, comedies were supposed to be funny (maybe I am wrong, but...), and this movie was funny!"
4,Loved it!,Loved the movie! Thought it was funny and very enjoyable to watch. Its easy to tell how the plots gonna go but its so fun to sit and watch that it doesn't really matter. Kevin Costner was Gorgeous like ALWAYS! haha. You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy the movie you just have to relax and sit through it. Don't watch if your a stuck up butt head. Its funny! Let it be!
1,A Tin Cup is needed,"If movies like these keep coming out, the actors will need tin cups to collect the coins offered by those making comedies. This movie is billed as a ""comedy,"" but perhaps they were using Dante's definition. The movie is flat and is constantly hampered by contrived dialogue and guesses as to what people think is funny. A much better movie about golf is ""Dead Solid Perfect,"" based on the wisdom of golf writer Dan Jenkins, and which Tin Cup borrows/steals from in an insignificant way. Don't rent this...watch a real comedy like The Fortune Cookie or The Odd Couple."
2,OK but not great,I thought this would be funnier but it is more of a chick flick. The acting was mediocre at best.
2,"Stretches the imagination a lot, with Bum to PRO.","Good Theme but a lot of miss hits along the way. The real reason I did'nt like it as much as my son was the reality of being a Driving Range Pro to become a U.S. Open contender. The likelhood of that happening is too far. But yet it had it moments, Good Looking Girl/Shrink who just happens to hit West Texas? Who is in love with a Pro Golfer, who is McAvoy's old nemisis? COME ON, get real, Bull Durham it's not, and every Kevin Cosner move tries to recapture that Minor League'r making it big routine. One thing it did do was make a lot more women look at Golf and Golfers a lot more. The final cut of all was this guy was a Butt to his friends and had absolutely no class That's the reason I gave it a 2."
4,Beautiful pictures and a perfect book for any man cave,I must say I'm not cars person but I was drawn in by the pictures and was intrigued once I started reading it. I found myself reading my own coffee table book. I enjoyed the pictures very much and learned a lot that I didn't know before.
5,"I believe in a few things. God, the devil, and Ben Harper.","Simply outstanding. Simple being the keyword here. Ben proves that music does't need to be complex to be moving. The melancholy 'Waiting on an angel' is a prime exaple of a simple yet beautiful song. The upbeat 'Mama's got a girlfriend now' will bring anyone to their feet. Majestic to say the least, this debut is followed by the even more masterful 'Fight for your mind', a must have album. In the modern gansta rap world we live in, Ben provides a breath of fresh air. Highly recommended."
2,Brotherslicko,"Well, I have heard about Ben Harper off and on, for acouple years. I finally bought this CD. I must say, I do not find myself drawn to it. I don't have a need to listen to it. It's somewhat forgetable. I would have thought with his following, I would have stubbled upon some great work."
4,durable item,"I've owned two of these for the past 7 years, using them approx. 5 hours each day, 4 days a week in the elements. This thing is tough with the strongest AM reception I've ever come across. Pleased with the adapter and control placements. Only downside is with today's players it seems bulky."
3,A good book for toddlers,"My daughter has enjoyed this book since she was about a year old. We have two cats, but neither one of them wanted to have anything to do with my daughter, and she was very frustrated that she couldn't hold them. This book solved the problem. It's very large, and the pictures are very expressive of typical kitten behavior. My daughter expecially loved the page where the cat asks to be tickled -- it didn't take her long to figure out how to do that! Now that she's three, and old enough to be able to approach the cats right, she can hold them and pet them. But every so often she pulls this book off of the shelf and asks to read it. It's not the kind of book that's going to be beloved by children for generations, but it's worth having if you have a toddler who likes animals."
4,ok kitty book,"Bought this for my newly turned one year old who is CRAZY over cats. It's a cute book, cute pictures, simple words. She likes it from time to time, but it's not one of her favorites. It's pretty basic, not much to grow on for her but I'm hoping it will gain favor in a year or so with my older son who is just now beginning to read and who also loves cats. Lucky for us, our docile senior siamese puts up with a lot of child loving."
1,No Disguising Bad,"This movie was an annoying, undisguised waste of Carvey's talent. Turned it off after fifteen minutes and am angry at wasting that much of my life."
1,Very weak plot,"All that I can say about this movie is wow.......I first saw this movie in the theater at the age of 10. I remember wanting to die while watching it. I found it as one of the dumbest, stupidest, weakest plots imagineable. Perhaps you would like the movie if you were 6....but the average 10 year old can tell that this movie is a 10 minute skit dragged out over 80 minutes."
5,the inside scoop of master of disguise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is a five star comedy for the whole family. there are some parts that are funny some toching and some sad. but not to much for me to say i dont want to give away the movie or at lest some parts. i havent seen the movie yet but me and my best friend are going to be the first one there. well go see the movie for your self and you decide if it desrevs five stars i know i will.This is Jessica saying bye talk later bye.
4,Sponge Bob pinball game,My 4 year old sons enjoys the game. It is not very sturdy when using the legs but on the table it seems to play better. Would be more enjoyable for him if it had more lights and sounds on it.
1,Very disappointing.,"After all the wonderful things I heard about this book, it ended up being a major letdown. I had trouble following the storyline, and could never really tell whether this was supposed to be a realistic account of what happened or just somebody's vivid imagination. I was kind of hoping the second part of the book might clarify some of my questions from the first part, but all it succeeded in doing was furthering my dislike for this book. If you have something else you would rather read, I would suggest doing so."
5,Adorable introduction to the real thing,"I have to laugh at those reviewers who seem so offended by these books! Have you actually read the originals?! These books simply take small exerpts from the originals and simplify them for a younger audience. I too absolutely loved the original books and still do. But I'm not going to be able to read them to my 3 year old without her losing interest. Therefore, I share these shorter versions with her and she loves them. When she's older (the originals are recommended for 8-12 year olds) I'll give her the originals. In the meantime these are fabulous and I very much doubt Laura Ingalls Wilder would take offense to them. Seriously, calm down!!"
2,i don' t think you knew what you were writing about!,"i don't think you have the faintess idea about laura! i don't think you knew her true feelings, ideas, hopes, and dreams! this book is wearing a disguise. trying to imitat the dearly loved little house books! you people who do this make me sick!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,How do you hang this stupid thing?,"This curtain rod is cheaply made and comes with no instructions. I can't figure out how to hang it, and even the Levolor website couldn't offer any help. I will say though, at least it is cheap."
3,It's okay...,"Go to family dollar. Nothing different about these rods, except the name Levolor. They're regular old curtain rods. Not extra thickness or anything, just have that name. .99 Store or Family Dollar"
5,Awesome!,"The game is great for me because unlike other games with mostly pop culture questions, it had a wide diversity of other topics. Lots of fun with finding out the quirks of famous people in the ""Spot the Lie"" type questions too."
4,Women's Erotica,"I watched four stories from Season 1 and concede that the actresses are generally attractive and in one case had looks appropriate to the story lines. (No Pamela Andersons playing doctors.) There were some decent writing though it was obvious the intent was to plumb the depths of feminine sexual fantasy in that elements of a story or two some times challenged one's credulity.I enjoyed them well enough to intend to watch the remainder. I've seen some other erotic series intended for male audiences and some of them were terrible. Having a female perspective can involve the sexiest part of the body: the mind.But if you're looking for stimulation this series pales in comparison to ""Women: Stories of Passion"" a series I saw on cable and unfortunately is available only in a non-USA format. I recall it being sexier and less restrained.Women: Stories of Passion - Vol. One - 3-DVD Set ( Women: Stories of Passion - Vol. 1 ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom]"
1,awful,I was so excited when I saw this on the oxygen channel. But I watched and saw that it was truely awful. I watched another episode to see if it would get better. It didn't. A true disappointment.
3,A few nice tracks,"I really enjoyed the song ""Another Day"" which was my favorite song on the album. Very nicely done with the violin and light orchestra in the second half of that song. The last song The Day to Day is pretty good too. There are one or two other decent tracks on here. But the majority of the songs on here just don't warrant repeat listens and don't seem very interesting."
3,"""Pearl White"" is not white",I am not going to have a chance to find out if these are truly comfortable because I need a larger size and the right color. Just be aware that Pearl White is relatively dark. It's more like ivory or light beige.
4,For The Doom II fans out there,"Probably one of the better DOOM guides out there. Ed Dille, the writer of this very good guide, adds more than just the basic strategy to this guide. He adds some attitude and a few sections that most guides do not have. I suggest this guide to nearly anyone. My only problem is that the strategies are explained in a few paragraphs and you have to read through the whole level strategy to find the part you are looking for. Other than that the maps are amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Also see the Bradygames DOOM II strategy guide for an alternative."
1,Adapter,I ordered the adapter with the red LED indicator light.Received one WITHOUT the red indicator LED light.Will not order the product again.
3,Not Bad...Wait for the Video,"If you have kids who enjoy the show then I would highly recommend you see this film in the theater. However, if its just one of many shows your kids sometimes watch I would advise you wait until it comes out on video and pick it up.The plot is a little slow for an adult audience and the animation is nothing to get excited about, but the characters are engaging and the message is a good one. If you have children who enjoy the TV show and you're looking for a fun movie to see I would encourage you to check this one out."
1,A good show... horrible movie.,"This movie was all around dull. The only good scene was when Big Bob is fighting Nick Vermiccili and he falls against the refrigerator and pickle juice spills on him and turns him green and he stands up and growls and rips of his shirt like the Hulk and beats the snot out of Nick... Aside from that and Helga sighing blissfully about bulldozers at the end when she confesses her love to Arnold this movie sucked.The animation was better than the TV show, the music wasn't there... the plot wasn't there... This movie was a dud."
1,Wrong ISBN Number,"Ordered book under ISBN number and was sent the incorrect book, I have to use the book because I need it for class while I am searching for the correct book under the original ISBN number I originally ordered."
2,Average with inapropriate casting of Dulcinea,"The movie is reasonably made and it somewhat sticks to the original story. However, the casting of Vanessa Williams as Dulcinea is wrong. Dulcinea was a Spaniard from La Mancha in the city of El Toboso. 99.9% of Spaniards are white, mostly with dark hair but light to olive skin and fine facial features. Vanessa Williams is a mulata (a mix of white and african black). The Cervantes story originates in the 15th century (around the time of Christopher Columbus' Discovery). The mulatos did not come into being until the 17th century and much more in the 19th century and later. This was when the Black African slaves mixed with the European (French, British, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese) whites. Therefore, this is like picking Tom Hanks to play Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in his biographical movie.Anglos need to stop inproperly labeling ""hispanics"" and learn a little bit of history, anthropology and sociology."
2,Disappointing,"I actually heard this album after her amazing second album Too Much Woman"" because it's much harder to find. TMW set the bar pretty darned high, but it seems Brigette wasn't at that level at the time of Take Advantage of Me. The only good tracks are Cherish this Love, the title track and You Got Somethin I Want, which is the only Steve Harvey produced track on the album. Luckily, Harvey had a much bigger role in TMW, and it really shows. Steer clear of this one, but PLEASE don't sleep on Too Much Woman."
4,good book,this book teaches a good lesson about who your true friends are when you and your family are facing problems in your personal life. I'm sure many people who have been in the same situation can relate to this book and wanting to raise more money to help a family member run the household.
3,Weekest Link in Catalog,"I am a major Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry fan, so this albums release was a major disappointment. Reason being he doesn't seem to be inspired at all. In addition, there isn't even one upbeat song (not even mid tempo) on the whole album! Although half the slow songs are quite good, energy is still lacking. You would never know this guy knows how to rock from listening to this CD. Pick any other Ferry CD unless you want to fall asleep."
5,Amazing!,This album is one of Bryan Ferry's finest. Serene and hauntingly magical only a true fan will appreciate. It's a must buy since iTunes doesn't carry it.
4,"Better than average ""Trek"" movie","I'm a Star Trek fan who prefers the original series (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, etc.). Nevertheless, ""Star Trek: First Contact"" is a better than average movie that should appeal to most sci fi fans, even if they don't know much about Star Trek. There is plenty of action and suspense, and the special effects are simply tremendous."
3,Best of TNG flicks,"So far, this is the best of the three Next Generation films. (I'm really looking forward to Nemesis, though.) The best parts of any Trek film are when you see the characters stressed to their limits, and the usually cool Picard gets really [angry] in this one. The extra-vehicular fight with magnetic boots is very slick.The bad thing about it is that they seem to have little regard for continuity with previous Trek lore. The story completely contradicts the book Strangers in the Sky, the excellent Giant Book about humanity's first contact with the Vulcans. The whole idea of the Borg Queen undermines the idea of the soulless unified menace presented by the Borg. As for Zephram Cochrane, yes, he was mentioned way back in the old series. But the scenes with him are rather corny. You don't get any sense of the time period whatsoever.Anyway, if you are at all into Trek, you should get this one."
4,One of the better Star Trek movies for sure,"I won't go into too much detail, I'll just say that if you enjoy Star Trek movies, you should like this. Of course, if you're even thinking about buying it, you've PROBABLY seen it in the theaters...so I'll say this: the movie holds up nicely in repeat watching on DVD. Sure, it's got more action than most, but it also has time travel, which seems to help make for good movies. Personally, I still think Wrath of Khan (#2) is the best of the bunch, but depending on your taste, I'd place First Contact as either the 2nd best or 3rd best. Frankly, this movie may be worth watching just to see the Borg Queen - from entrance to exit, that is an amazing character."
3,um...,"*yawn*...okay then. This film isn't BAD, but it's WAY too action-oriented for its own good. This is STAR TREK, for god's sake! It's meant to be about people and ideas. This is mostly about shooting at things. The plot inconsistencies are also glaring. It has its moments (Brent Spiner's always great), but I thought it was a bit of a let-down, myself."
5,The very best,"If you are not a Trekkie, this great movie helps to explain why so many of us are. It has all of the key ingredients. Compelling character development presented by the exceptional cast, timeless themes that focus on big ideas and ideals, a great story, superior production values and a moving soundtrack. It never gets old. If you already are a Trekkie, then of course you know all of this."
4,The Next Generation is getting their act together.,"Somehow, Star Trek movie sseem best, when the cast goes back in time to present day. I am not quite sure what it is, but the actors seem to enjoy their work more. First Contact, like The Voyage Home is a typical example of this rule. Much better then Generations, this movie, while not quite as good as some of the original series movies is at least up to standard. The cast does a better job, the story is more interesting and the charactres have obviously been around for some time, aquiring a bit of personality. Good special effects and an excellent role by Alice Kriege as the Borg Queen make this an enjoyable movie for everybody."
3,It was okay. Generations is better.,"The Enterprise E is outstanding but the movie itself could have used a lot more work. The graphics were good, but the plot and storyline were questionable. Overall, It wasn't too good, and I would still rather see Independence Day."
5,Best Star Trek Movie Ever,"Of all the Star Trek movies, even the ones with the original Star Trek series cast, this one is absolutely the best. Superbly written with a great story. Frakes did an excellent job as well with directing. Special effects are pretty good for the always tight budget of Roddenberry flicks, (as expected with any Star Trek movie). Data is a center point of the plot and shows some pretty bad ass moves against the Borg at times. Oh, and Deanna Troi looks absolutely hot in this movie! Highly recommended watch again and again.[...]"
5,Trekie,"I like this movie. You either like it or you don't, Patrick Stewart and cast take us on a ride. It was fun!"
2,"A solid action film, even if it packs just punches","CONS:Modern Hollywood action film, if you've seen Eagle Eye, you've seen this. Warp speed plot. Fast dialogue of things we haven't been made aware of yet, the techno babble about ""First Contact.""Fans of the original series, it's mostly an popcorn action film and I would not recommend this for you....PROS:There are many well played intense actions scenes between Picard and the Borg (his arch nemesis).On the DVD edition, Jonathan Franks is (as always) very funny, self-aware and introspective, a fan's best friend, he provides a very interesting commentary."
5,The First Contact,Star Trek VIII: known as First Contact is about the borg leader being identified and them trying to stop First Contact after warp drive is intoduced by Z. Cocrin. This is a fast pace Star Trek Movie most of the movies by Star Trek have attempted to show many advancements in special effects. By showing off the vairous ships and docking in space. This is one of the better Star Trek movies it stays with a story line and show the charters and the relationships developed over the years. Jon Luke is one of the best Captains as he is a actor of the old style well educated in the acting arts. Kirk an ego maniac and Jane Way an over bearing captains. Jon Luke shows the emotional side of a captain. I like this movie also because it shows the charter flaws and strengths. One of the best Trek movies. Nemisis being the other.
4,Someone,"This book was evidently a classic in my opinion. With reading the past few books, it's impressive how uncanny the personalities reflect those of an actual cat. Very suspenseful, and one of my favorites in a while."
