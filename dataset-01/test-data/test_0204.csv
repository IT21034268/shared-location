3,"Time away, no change","Alright, I'll admit I used to be a Backstreet Boy Fanatic, I've seen them in different cities because they didnt come to my town a few times, heck I've even been on satge with them during their Into the Millennium Tour, but I am just not impressed with this album. At least not like the others. They made such a big deal about having a more mature sound on this album, but to me the songs sound just as pop as ever. I really like a few of the songs already though. Crawling back to you, climbing the walls and Siberia are all great content songs, and by far the best on the album.I may not like the album as much as their previous but Im still going to wear the cd out, I could never not support my boys, Im just so happy they're back!"
3,Too Slanted Religously and Politically for Me,"I have a love-hate relationship with this text. I love the amount of information she shares about curriculum. It could be a valuable guide for many homeschoolers. I hate the parts when she shares her ultra conservative, anti-feminist,right-wing, ""I am a Christian so the World is Christian"" view that she intersperses throughout the book. Its fine if she is preaching to the choir, a Christian choir. I am not a member of that group now do I wish to be. I find many of her slanted views offensive. If you like Rush Limbaugh, you will like her book. Need I say more?"
4,Workhorse Watch,"I've worn Timex Ironman watches for the past 13 years. They are very decent watches for a relatively inexpensive price. I prefer the resin strap watches because they don't retain odors like the cloth straps do.I can take or leave the Flix technology, it activated itself sometimes when I didn't want to, and wouldn't work when I did. I just relied on using the normal Indiglo button.These watches typically last me about a year and a half, and it is always the same piece that gives out. The small retaining band for the strap breaks inexplicably in the middle of the night, and I end up with the excess end of the strap flapping and catching on my clothes and falling off. The new watch straps are about half the price of what a brand new watch costs, and I find I prefer just to pick out a new watch because after the year the paint on the face has started to chip and it looks ragged. It's also a refreshing change of pace to get a new color."
2,"This author throws it all against the wall, and some sticks","I detest the conduct of Bill Clinton. I disliked some things about this book. Primarily, that the author threw a ton of stuff against the wall, to see how much of it would stick. In doing so, some does, and a lot doesn't. Therein lies the problem: making accusations which lack substantiation or a volume of compelling circumstantial evidence, helps rather than hinders the Clintons. The book relies too much on rumor and innuendo to truly succeed. I have gained much better information and enjoyment from the Slick Willie books, the Year of the Rat book, Dave Marrannis First In His Class, No Surprises, and even The Clinton Chronicles book. The book's redeeming value is that you will read some things you probably haven't before, and a few of them have credible facts and evidence. These are in the minority, however."
3,kinda flimsy. average.,"Beware of Amazon shipping. They will pack this poorly in a triangular mailer tube which will get squashed in transit, bending the straight-edge. You will send it back, and get a replacement, and they will pack it exactly the same. You will not receieve a straight straight-edge. If you ever get a non-bent one, it will serve its purpose, but it's nothing fantastic."
1,"consider the source and motivation carefully, please...","The best advice regarding the written word is to carefully consider the source and motivation for writing it. With that in mind, one sees a steady flow of uninformed, sensational (yes, even malicious) attacks upon the Masons. They carefully ignore mentioning Christian leaders as Norman Vincent Peale, Methodist Bishop Carl Sanders, and the late president of Baylor University (Southern Baptist) Abner McCall- all 33rd Degree Scottish Rite Masons. It's ALL about portraying Masonry as a non-Christian (it's NEVER claimed to be Christian) or as some ""alternative religion"". My long held stance is that it's a handy way for these ""evangelists of ignorance"" to fill their coffers in the same way the National Enquirer does. The unwashed mob is still out there, watching TV and sending their hard-earned dollars in to ""ministers"" who probably know better than what they're saying, laughing all the way to the bank..."
1,Anti-Masonic Propaganda,"Dear Readers, please be VERY careful with this work. It is written by anti-Masons with the sole goal of presenting anti-Masonic propaganda. This is not a book of facts, it is a book of falsehoods - proven falsehoods under the guise of facts. John Ankerberg & John Weldon have been peddling this nonsense for some time. Buyer beware. For a more accurate look at Freemasonry, read:Masonic Questions and Answers"
4,"Yeah, its good","Its a little over the top in parts for me, but there's no denying that Dorn knows what he's about. It is not as experimental as the likes of Autechre, Richard James/Aphex, and it isn't as slyly funky as Amon Tobin's stuff or the recent Funki Porcini, but Dorn gets quite a psychedelic groove going. Dorn also is pretty imaginative in his rythmic use and placement of samples. He hasn't quite ascended Mt. Olympus yet, but he's getting real close. Recommended."
5,amazing,"For the past few years U.S tech-step drum and bass has been able to match the quality of similiar material from overseas. But never before has a U.S artist been able to match Britain's style of intelligent drum and bass. Adam Dorn changes all that, and this album is as compelling as anything you will hear from Metalheadz or Good-Looking. He creates a jazzy atmosphere not unlike that of Amon Tobin/Cujo, but his drum breaks are more structured and danceable. But the most intriguing feature of his music is the acid effects he utilizes to give the songs a tripped out feel. Very few junglists have experimented with implementing this tool.(although techno and house embrace it.) Mocean Worker, however, uses it on almost every track, crafting a fluid style that most musicians only dream of. I think I've said enough. So if you are interested enough in Mocean Worker to read this review, I guarantee that you will love this music... Amazon, you should pay me for writing these reviews!"
4,A flashback to the future,"I shoulda, coulda , woulda, but didn't?One of Uma Thurman's best acting jobs.You have the young rebellious teenager whopictures herself as a ""slut"" and the older versionof a mother with a young daughter. The bond of friendshipbetween two teen age girls seems as strong as the will to live here.The choices, ghosts of our decisions that haunt our futureare very cleverly woven into the plot.A slow and intellectual movie with the flashbacksreplaying over and over untilreality sets the end..."
4,For My Grandson,Great purchase and timely delivery. My grandson is quite pleased with his Birks. We took them to our local Birkenstock store to get some additional holes for a more secure fit. I'm sure he'll get great wear from his Birks. Thank you!
5,Off the chart!,"This book had everything - drama - lot's of it! Intrigue - Suspense, love, betrayal, etc. You name it and it was there. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of his novels. They just keep getting better and better."
3,Alright,"This book was pretty good. It started off nicely and had a great plot. At times it seemed to drag on, but overall it was a nice read. You will relate to each of the characters thanks to Johnson taking the time to develop each one. Each character has a story and they all relate to one another in some form or fashion. Just when you think you can predict what's going to happen, Johnson surprises you with a totally unexpected outcome. The ending was great, prob the best part of the book b/c all the stories come to a head and you really didn't expexct it to end tis way! It's a nice read."
5,Page Turner,"A great well-written book with believable characters. This one is worth the money. It's not your typical ""girl meets boy."" story. It has romance, mystery, drama and humor. I think readers of all ages will like the story. RM does a good job of making each character multi-dimensional. No one is perfect in this story. By the end of the book, you feel like you actually know and understand Rafe, Livvy, Hennessey, Alize and Wade. I found myself pulling for each of them. As a single mother, I definitely related to Livvy and understood her struggles with working, raising children.I have read all 5 of his novels and enjoyed each. Check out the author's website at www.rmnovels.com. He posts the first 3 chapters of his books on the site so you can get a feel for the book before you purchase it."
4,Compact USB2 4PORT,"Slik modern design,small,3.5"" x 2"" hub. Clear ""power on"" light, no separate USB out indicator lights. Loses a ""star"" for no USB ""out"" light indicators."
4,It Works,"It's a USB hub. It works. It doesn't get terribly hot or blow out the PC's USB controller when you power it up. What more can you ask for? (Well, it would be nice if the connectors were on the front for a change...)The only thing preventing a five-star rating is the fact that mine was supplied with an annoyingly short 3-foot (or maybe one-meter) cable rather than the ""5-foot"" cable listed in the description."
5,Natural and works,"After reading the benefits of soy isoflavones, I purchased this for my wife. She suffers from daily menopausal hot flashes. After taking this product for over a month now, the hot flashes reduced from 4-5 a day to 4-5 a week. It's now an Amazon subscription item."
4,Great Service good product,"I bought these and they were easy to install; they work well when there's steady stream of water; but if I just want to wash the windshield or the rain is intermittent they squeak; somewhat bothersome, but otherwise ok -- especially the price. One word about the seller -- GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE; asked about my reaction to the blades, and was advised about the squeaking; sent me a complete new set for free; a little better but still some squeaking; but his service was GREAT."
1,NOT THE PRODUCT IN THE PICTURE OR DESCRIPTION,"If you see the supposed label information, it is a different formula than the one I received.I specifically wanted the product as shown. I received a much inferior product."
3,Not sure how effective these are...,"My husband is experiencing some male menopause-like symptoms so we read the reviews of this product and decided to try it. He has been taking 6 each day (3 pills in the morning and 3 pills at night) for about 3 weeks now and he hasn't noticed a difference really. He feels like he has a little more energy at times, but as far as the other symptoms it just isn't showing any signs of improving. Maybe more time will tell..."
1,cheesy product,"will make a small child happy, but music is tinny and named for popular songs that sound like they were recorded in the back alley of thailand. definietly would not purchase again"
2,Not What You Think It Is.,When i bought this dance pad i thought it would be great. All it has are little arrows on a screen that barely say that you got ant right. The music is like the music on a gameboy like a mario game. I tried it onece and didn't like it if you have a playstation or X-box i sugjust getting a dance bad for them.
1,DDR Dance Pad,This item stinks!It is a 2004 version but my mother says it should be 1984 technology!My father says it looks and reminds him of PacMan!!!(But it's not as good as PacMan!) Do not be stupid and not read the reviews cause thats what i did!This product is horrible so DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,disappointed,"I recieved the item a few days late and when I went to try it, it would not work. I was very disappointed. The only thing that appeared was an image of the pad on the TV screen but the contacts in the pad would not work to start the game. We never got to play so I am returning the game."
1,Horrible dissapointment,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this one. We had gotten an equally awful version for Christmas and my daughter discovered the real DDR system in her vision therapy class at school. It is supposed to be great for cooridination issues. We thought we'd get a ""real"" ddr for home this summer. THIS IS NOT IT. It is even worse than the Christmas one. You can step exactly the same on the pad in the exact same time and way and you'll get random results. Once it says you were PERFECT, next MISSED. Horrible for coordination training since it gives innacurate feedback. False advertising since it is a cheap knock off."
1,A disapointment,"When I ordered this, I was expecting to not have the quality of the play station DDR. I was shocked to discover that it wasn't even worth a dollar. In my opinion it is a horrible system with pathetic songs. I was unable to spend more than a minute looking at it before the disgusting smell of plastic overwhelmed me. Over four months later it still smells just as bad. I highly recommend NOT BUYING THIS!"
2,A little disheartened,"I bought this CD because my friend let me hear the tape and I liked the video and gospel style of ""Baby Mama Drama"". But when I bought the unedited (read: stickered) version of the CD, I couldn't remember why I initially like this CD. I was dissapointed that he was cussing up a storm on the first half of the album. I don't know what's up with R&B singers today, but a bunch of swears does not a song make.Anyway, I liked the funky feel to the album yet I think Dave has better vocal skills than he displayed on his first time out. I like music that either inspires me to want to hear it again or recommend it to someone else. Sadly I couldn't do either with this one.Sorry dave, maybe next time."
4,Deep Down Raw,"This cd is not for everybody, it is explicit and brutally raw. If that is the mood you are in than this is for you. The lyrics are great to sing and the music feels good down to your toes."
5,Ghetto Hyms Brings Soul Music Back To Life!,"The former front man of Blackstreet dazzles us with this sixteen track album that all at once screams in anger and cries in pain. This is what soul music should be all about. He opens with an intro featuring the always charismatic Reggie Noble (Redman for the hip-hop deficient). And this intro is very appropriate for this soul album is laced with hip-hop elements. ""My Favorite Girl"" is a seductively slick slow jam that chronicles the dark side of the late night creep. ""Baby Mama Drama"" hits us over the head with lyrics that ring true to every man who has ever written a child support check. From the beautifully lush ""Can't Stay"", to the genuinely soulful mid-tempo Erick Sermon co-produced ""Call On Me"", to the heart-wrenchingly beautiful ""My Feelins"", this album delivers consistently and at once makes you smile and cry in empathy. Dave has put himself out there, and the results are nothing short of stellar. Ghetto Hyms is pure satisfaction!"
3,Review of Blades - Lexus IS250 and RainX,"Blades do not fit in Lexus Standard Brackets. However, they work perfectly in the Rain-X Latitude Wiper Blade Chassis. 1 month by, and are working great. Much better than factory blades."
5,Nice little jewelry bag,These are pretty small jewelry bags but they are really cute and also nice quality. They will hold a necklace and pair of earrings but not a large set.
4,cast your spell no further,"I picked up this disc cos I love Sleater-Kinney... and in my mind, Carrie Brownstein is the best of the three. The Spells didn't disappoint me either. First of all, the band name is wondrous... as is the music! The EP definitely should have been longer... an LP in the future would be great... :-) The first track is great. I definitely recommend this CD. I really like Helium as well, and this collaboration between the best of both Helium and Sleater-Kinney definitely rivals their mother bands."
5,great Movie!!!,"I loved this movie! It is one of my favourite movies of all time! I recommend to people who like romance mixed in with a bit of comedy, my best friend doesn't really like it, she is more of a ""Romy and Michelle's High School Renioun"" type of person! But I found it great! It is for the whole family!"
3,So-so,"Spoiled daughter and enabling mother guilt-trip dad into paying for ridiculously expensive and overdone wedding. Forgive me if I'm not entirely sympathetic. Plus, the movie gets overwhelmed in sap, sap, sap towards the end and loses its humor. It has its moments, though, so it's worth a viewing or two, even if it's not a must-own. My favorite bits: Steve Martin as father George Banks in the supermarket removing hot dog buns from the package so as to rectify the 8 hotdogs per package vs 12 buns per package situation and the scenes with Martin Short as wedding coordinator Franck (""George, why are you wearing blue tuxahdo?"" ""Franck, Armani doesn't make a blue tuxedo."" ""Armani also don't make polyester""). The actors are a talented bunch and the presence of Martin and Keaton do a lot to hold together a movie that otherwise wouldn't have much going for it."
5,So good I bought 2- One for me and one for a gift,"I love old movies and will watch them over and over. I love Steve Martin, he is always just plain funny."
3,good enough I guess,It was kind of flimsy when I got it. Action is a little too light. ONe good smallmouth and its gonna give out i believe. But I do like that it collapses like it does. Been looking for one of these since summer. Had a similar Shakespeare collapsable for years and it finally gave out on me this past summer. There are some Big smallmouth in ShoalS Creek.
4,A gift,I purchased this fishing rod for my nephew as a gift. He has not had a chance to use it yet. I am sure he will like it and because it is from a reputable company I am sure it is a good product.
1,not what they usta be,"Had perchused one of these 15 years ago in a combo pack. That was a great little rod,i had cought up to 4ib smallies,then last summer it finaly broke. So I ordered up a new one. At fisrt was impressed by the revisions to the guides. much wider than my original one. I did relize that the pole was only 4ft not 4'6. I threw on my little Daiwa Crossfire. I get to the lake to pick up a few sculpin and brim. First cast the rod snaped in two, right in the middle. Didnt even get to reel in the line. Just splintered and snaped in two. Only had 1/32oz weight."
4,Very Good Rod - Muy Buena Caña,"Very good rod, strong and beautifull, easy to carry. I did not rate it five star because did not have a guides with smooth ceramic inserts.Muy buena caña, fuerte y bonita, facil de cargar. No le coloque cinco estrellas porque la descripcion dice que tiene ceramica en los aros y no los trae."
4,Something New and Alluring,"I first heard Keiko Lee on a Slide Hampton album over a year ago. I enjoyed this album, although I found some tracks uneven. She's enthusiastic and the arrgangements are good. She has an alluring quality to her voice, and I like her energy. There is a quaintness to this album that keeps bringing me back."
2,fittment wrong,"The fitment guide sent me the wrong part, again. out of town for over a month. I have 3 Ford trucks It wont even come close to fitting any of them"
5,Just amazing!,My kids can not get enough of this book. I love the use of alliteration and they love figuring out what it really is that Patsy is afraid of.
2,Sony Edits Again!,"Sony has done it again. As with their edited-for-an-""R"" release of Young Adam, Sony has altered this release of Lila Says. During a scene where the lead characters look through an erotic comic book, all of the panels of the comic have been digitally fogged. Once again an unrated theatrical release of a foreign film has been dummied down to an ""R"" by everyone's favorite substitute parent, Sony.Who do they think they are protecting? What do they think will happen if adults see the full versions of these films? Why do they distribute these movies if they have a problem with the contents? Your guess is as good as mine.Great movie, bad presentation.Save your dough until Sony grows up and releases an un-edited version."
3,"Good start, but needs some meat.","This book has some recipies that are a good base, but try adding some diced tri-tip that has been grilled to a nice medium rare to the amazing chili recipe and it really takes off!"
5,Next best thing to being there ...,"Tickets to two shows in philly sold out in ten minutes. This DVD takes away some of the pain of not being there in person. Absolutely, the best concert DVD I have ever seen !!! Incredibly crystal clear video and the BEST 5.1 concert audio track I have ever heard. Turn the lights down, crank up the dolby digital 5.1, sit back and enjoy an awesome concert without the hassle of that guy who stands up through all the songs or that girl who has to sit on her boyfriend's shoulders directly in front of you. Bill A."
2,DVD is not that good,I liked to listen to Dangerfield and his one liners. Ordered this DVD and was VERY disappointed that there is little of Dangerfield on it. This disc is mostly other people talking about Dangerfield. What a disappointment. I would not recommend this to someone who wants to listen to Dangerfields routines.
4,helpful and soothing,Helpful and soothing CD to help me fall asleep at night. Easy to listen to and follow. This was recommended by my therapist and it's been integral in helping with my sleep!
4,This Year's Model,"""The Delivery Man"" not only rocks, it may be Costello's most raw and primal album since ""This Year's Model"", many moons ago. Here Elvis and his versatile and marvelous Imposters dive deep into the roots of American music, using elements of country, blues, and gutbucket rock and roll. The rockers kick ass. The ballads jerk tears. Alt-country divas Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams come along for the ride and do what they do to enhance the beauty and authenticity of Costello's work."
3,Not in his top 10,"The one thing you quickly learn if you spend any time reading the reviews on Amazon is how the fans of a particular artist all madly dash to post the most positive glowing review of the latest release. Wading through all this hyperbole can be both frustrating and at times very entertaining. Anyway, let me summarize...I have been an Elvis fan for many, many years, have all his discs, seen him live a gazillion times, etc. Compared to his other work, this is a solid B effort. Nothing more, nothing less. He has clearly done better. If you are new to Elvis do not start with this disc. Better bets would be Brutal Youth, Get Happy, or even When I was Cruel."
5,"Yes, this probably deserves 5","After Richard Thompson, Elvis probably has the best track record of any living British songwriter. To come out with such strong material something like 27 years after your first album is not something many people could manage. ""Country Darkness"" at least is as good a song as he has ever written, and there really is not a poor track on the whole album. My only reservation is that although I absolutely love ""There's a story in your voice"" as a song, I don't personally much care for Lucinda William's voice, and think it a shame that he didn't get Emmylou Harris to sing on that as well, but that is probably just me!"
3,DVD IS INCOMPLETE/ DVD Esta incompleto,"I was very dissapointed, had been waiting for the DVD to come out and it is very badly edited and did not show all the way to the end (which is very frustrating!) and want to get a full copy- would love to know if they are all ""faulty"" or when they may re-release with corrected editing"
3,When they will release the other season?,"Hi, I have the same problem and issue has other ppl here. Three disc and the complete whole soap without edit, and i watch the 3 disc and it doesnt even get to the half of the soup drama. I was asking when they will release the ohter part of the Soup I cant stand just watching 2hours of LOLa please somebody answer me!!!"
1,Worst movie in last 5 years,"I would warn you about the spoilers to follow but there is nothing at all to spoil. This movie is low cost which I don't mind. I don't mind bad acting. What I do mind is the only undead in this pitiful excuse of a movie are in some guys dream. Thats right! Everyone gets killed but like wow man it was only a dream. But worst of all, they wind up fighting a light monster. Thats right you heard it here first. A light monster. Movie sucks, sucks, sucks. These actors actuallly got cheated. A good script and this setting would have worked well. Movie sucked."
1,Buyer BEWARE!,"Yes, this was an OEM cartridge. Yes, it was in the original sealed package, but the original box was missing. These cartridges were most likely very, very OLD - they DID NOT print well, despite repeated cleaning and alignment. Removed the one purchased online and replaced it with a new one from Office Depot and bingo - the printer printed perfectly. BUYER BEWARE - this particular online retailer did not want to take return of defectives, referring me to the manufacturers warranty. The manufacturers warranty says to return to place of purchase!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've returned them, but have not received a credit yet and am disputing the charge with my credit card issuers. NOT WORTH THE HASSLE!!!"
5,Lexmark #1 OEM Ink Cartridge (18C0781),"I ordered this replacement color ink cartridge from Beta Ink. They sent in promptly but there was a problem with the cartridge only printing in blue ink. No black, no yellow. So I contacted them immediately by email. I received a prompt reply and they said that they were sending a replacement by mail & to discard the defective cartridge. They also told me why this may have happened and that sometimes these cartridges are defective. Both cartridges were in the silver sealed pouch just like you buy them from the store. Even though the first cartridge was defective, because of Beta Ink's prompt reply & replacement, I will purchase from them again."
3,Works But not on my printer,"I have an X5410 and it did not work. So if you have the same one as me, don't buy this one."
3,coffee table book,"It's a nice book, which gives you with few words a little introduction to this sport. The forword says:""... Polo is not for everyone, in many ways the game and its culture occupy such a rarefied enviroment that having aa casual interest in the sport is almost impossible. ...""Pics of the game, the speed, players and spectators, sometimes only horses and people behind the ponylines. A little bit of polo magic; simply a coffee table book. Something to show friends or a nice present also for horselovers."
4,Fast read and marvellous book,"Murder Most Puzzling is both a fast read--couldn't put it down!--and a deeply satisfying book. It's rare that one title turns out to be an indepth look at the politics of academia, an interesting medly of human relationships, a gender analysis of society . . . and a first-rate murder mystery that holds one's attention to the last page. I heartily recommend this one!"
3,Vim (VIMV444) 4 20-Clip Rails Socket Tray,"Vim (VIMV444) 4 20-Clip Rails Socket TraySocket tray is black and not red as pictured which was not that big of a deal?, also backing plate is very thin which makes it wimpy when trying to carry to job location with heavy sockets as designed. One other thing rails are very close together so large sockets don't fit next to each other. Clips can be moved around but then does not look organized this way. I think that's what this is supposed to do right? Organize?You decide!!RagenRat:0)"
4,OLAP Jack,"Hi, I am Irish. Unlike our friend from the 38th parallel, I can write in English very easily and I'm quite adept at that thar American lingo as well. Therefore, I read this book in a week during me mornin' Guiness at the pub and it gave me the review on OLAP I was looking for. This is definitely a book for beginners and advanced developers as well and quite surprisingly me British bloks were able to read it in two weeks so it must be written well."
4,Wow,"Most multi-vitamin supplements are big on promises and small on delivery. For the price -tag this one -like all Rainbow Light products I've tried in the past a excellent choice. You will feel some ""youthful"" reactions in your bodies gentleman."
2,A little disappointing,"I am a HUGE fan of Chante Moore,and had been waiting anxiously for her new album,especially after hearing her new single.However,after listening to the whole project,I am somewhat disappointed.She still sounds great,and most of the production is solid,but I don't think the songs really fit an artist of her ability.I personally feel that her first album was her best,especially due to the production work of George Duke.I think Chante' strayed away somewhat from her true style,which is ballads.The Rodney Jerkins track does not work for her at all,in my opinion.I still am a big fan,but I hope she returns to what got her where she is with the 4th album."
4,"Loving Chante Moore is definately ""easy"".","After too long an absence, Chante Moore returns to the scene with ""This Moment is Mine"".This latest offering is a mix of smooth R&B grooves and sultry ballads. The lead off hit single ""Chante's Got a Man"" is already a summer anthem. This set is more commercial than her last efforts, yet Chante' distinguishes herself from the overcrowded field of pop divas by virtue of her talent. Chante can actually sing. Standouts include the quiet stormish ""Easy"", the latin tinged ""Blooming Flower"", ""I See You In A Different Light"" a duet with Jo Jo Hailey and the funky ""I Got the Love"" which would make Chaka proud. Let's hope that the title cut proves prophetic for this gifted yet underappreciated performer."
5,Chante's Moment Is Hers,"I remember this album when I was in the 6th grade. I love this record. It is a favorite of mine! This album is a 12-song opus that chronicles her unique and intimate observations about love, affection, and commitment. This album is the crown jewel of Chante's career. Chante stays true to her formula of mixing musical ingredients like a master chef by enlisting the creme de la creme producers. Remember, this was 1999."
1,What happened here?,"If you have Chante's ""Precious"" and ""A Love Supreme"" then you will understand why this CD is a great disappointment. ""Chante's Got A Man"" is the best song on the disc, with ""If I Gave Love"" coming in second. I'm still a Chante fan. I just hope her next effort is a heck of a lot better than this."
3,I See Chante In A Differnt Light!,"Chante Moore continues to try an establish herself as one of R&B's biggest stars yet she has one problem. She has very little material to get there. The only song on the album that truly does Chante any good is ""I See You In A Different Light"". Written by Diane Warren (The best songwriter in the world) the songs tender lyrics and warm, slow moving melody give Chante and duet partner Jo-Jo- Hailey something to work with. They respond with a powerful performance that lets the listener feel the emotion of the song. It is her songs that get the best out of artist and once again that is the case on This Moment Is Mine. Hopefully the record company releases this song, because it's one of the songs that could become a major hit!"
4,"Twelve Days (The McRae's, Book 1, Sam and Rachel)","I really enjoyed this book. It is a story of love, loss, and trials. It certainly made me want to read the other books in the McRae series"
1,OH MY GOD WHAT WERE THEY THINKING,"I COULD HAVE MADE A BETTER CD IN MY SLEEP. HELL, LISTENING TO THE NOISE MY CAT MAKES WHEN SHE'S IN HEAT IS MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THIS CD WAS. A BUNCH OF RECYCLED BEATS AND WHACK LYRICS IS ALL IT IS. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Worst ICP ever,"This, without a doubt, the worst ICP album ever made. I got as the first one, and loved it. Then I picked up CoC, the one with Night of the Axe, and loved that. Right now, I have all the Jokers cards, fotgotten freshness, and the 3 Pendulem singles. My friends, go get RiddleBox, Ringmaster, Melinko, CoC, and all the EPs, but don't get his one. This is like pop, for God's sake. All these kids are like ""we be Juggalos"" and I axed em what cds they have, and they're like Jeckles. Sickening."
2,Not their best,The Great Milenko proved to be better by leaps and bounds. This CD boasted more immaturity and stupidity then prior CDs. The lyrics often were over-written and music over-looped. It lost its creativity soon after track 3.
4,Good... Music,"Hey people! If ya like ICP i really don't think they let ya down with this great CD. The cd has good flow and has that weird concept that we all love when we are sitting back... Now don't get me wrong this doesn't quite live up to The Great Milenko but it isn't far behind. If ya like ICP you will not be dissapointed with this cd. So Pick it..., and fire it up while this... cd sets the mood."
3,Lost it??,"Having been a fan since earlier this year, I expected this cd to be as good as the others. But I was disappointed at the lack of carnival content. But, saying that, it does have THE best song that ICP have done so far in Nothings left. The Amazing Jeckel Brothers may not be as good as the others, but what the hell, it's ICP, and a must for any true juggalo."
4,I really can't say.,It's hard to charachterize this album. So here's my guide:For mellow people: Don't buy it you'll be too offended.For Juggalos: Gotta get it! It's a joker card.For medium ICP fans: It's a fifty/fifty chance.
1,You Got TO BE KIDDING RIGHT?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!,"This guys are just plain dumb anyone who listens to this crap should just punch themselves in the face right now.....this isnt even music its trash and anyone who find any meaning out of it is prob just a loser anyway....what ICP really does is makes people turn into DumbSh**'s and they call themselves Juggalos and jugellettes i am sick of this pointless teenager group of losers thinking they all bad ass cause they listen to ICP and ""THATS IT"" what a loser group like i said anyone who listens to this trash should punch themselves!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Another new sound but clearly no less enjoyable.,"With every new CD the Clowns release their sound is slightly different. After several releases the trend continues with not only a slightly different sound, but guest stars. Most CD's take time to get used to but after listening to Amazing Jeckel Brothers only two times, I was hooked all over again."
5,"If you're from Mars, this book may need translation","John Gray did the male gender no favors by characterizing us guys as ""from Mars"". Fortunately, Deborah Tannen knows better. Despite her male detractors, who usually find fault with what they consider overindulgence of the more estrogen-laden of our species, Dr. Tannen strives (and succeeds) at maintaining a refreshing academic distance from a strong gender bias in this seminal work. Her anecdotal examples of male and female communication styles are convincing and rub no ones noses in their own verbal messes. Having found impenetrable more than one woman's labyrinth of words and feelings, it was quite comforting to find from a woman a sympathetic spirit. If you have tried reading ""Men Are From Mars..."" and were put off by the premise, ""You Just Don't Understand"" may provide a welcome alternative in the male/female communication blues."
2,Over-simplified version of life that doesn't ring true.,"This book aspires to explain sociological conditioning of the sexes in an over-simplified manner. While the idea that men and women communicate differently is one with socio-linguistic merit, and worthy of study, it is not soley GENDER based. There are more issues to be explored and included that were not (class, age, background, to name a few). I was disappointed."
5,Erica does not wear prada!!,"The Devil's Nightmare is a great early 1970's horror film. This film combines horror and beauty to make a delightful satanic film. Erica Blanc's portrayal of sexy and stunning she-devil is breath taking to say the least!.If Erica is the devil herself, I need to find the on-ramp which leads to the Highway to Hell!!!."
1,Why a plastic chicken?,"I ordered the picture below and I ended up with a plastic chicken dressed for Christmas.....this is so weird!!How do I return this chicken and get the ""Dog House"" dog charm?"
5,Cute,No complaints from the lil man on this one. He has almost watched his whole box set within a week!
5,I have to give this one five stars sheer intrigue!,"I give this movie 5stars. I compare all horror flicks by this one (Phantasm I). Not many horror flicks exceed this movie, but maybe the original Shinning, but only in my judgement. Phantasm Rules Phorever! Terry Sr from TN 1999"
4,This movie rocks! Better the second time!,"The first time I watched this movie, there were some confusing moments, but mainly, this movie was one of those that you can't just watch a first time and must be experienced a second to achieve the full effect! A worthy addition to the beloved Phantasm series, and I only hope that a five is in the works!"
3,Flashbacks Aplenty,"This movie is for anyone that has never seen any of the Phantasms. Filled with flashbacks (with actual original footage which is pretty cool)from all 3 previous Phantasms, Phantasm 4 is good movie to watch inorder to catch up with the phantasm mythos. However, is you've alreadly seen 1-3 the movie might tend to get a little boring with the flashbaacks but it is still worth seeing, just to see the scene with Reggie and the girl is the motel."
2,A Little Dissapointed,I was actually pretty dissapointed with the last Phantasm movie in the series. I remember first buying Phantasm on DVD not knowing what to expect and I loved it!! I ran out to the video store and rented II and III. I loved them! But then I buy Phantasm IV: Oblivion on DVD and it was pretty hopeless. Why include scenes from the first Phantasm that none of us have ever seen?? It made no sense whatsoever! The ending was so confusing I lost track...does this mean there's going to be ANOTHER sequel or what? I was pretty bored with this movie...it could have been a lot better! It's a good movie for Phantasm fans to add to their collection. Phantasm will ALWAYS be the best out of all the 4!!
4,Ray poised for Superstardom,"Thank Rhino for reissuing this overlooked album. This was his first after he split from Atlantic for ABC/Paramount. People like to think that his ABC/Paramount period starts with MODERN SOUNDS, but you can see the ""road"" Ray's traveling with this album. Most of the orchestration is done with a lot of taste and not syrupy as might plague some later recordings. These cuts sound classic today and not dated -- well, except for the silliness over Deep in the Heart of Texas.Enjoy this album for more than Ray's signature tune of Georgia on my Mind, Ray's solo on Moon over Miami, for example. The bonus cuts complete the experience. This album will help bridge those who only know Ray from his Atlantic years into the rest of his career - about a 40 year period!"
2,Palomino - A Soap Opera,"A beautiful, successful career woman gets dumped, goes to join a friend at a ranch, has a riding accident, overcomes this setback, and falls in love with a cowboy... Oh, please."
3,Another Danielle Steel Book...same old stuff!,"I had not read a Danielle Steele Book in a very long time. As I was reading Palomino Ikept thinking I must have read this book before, All of the books seem to be the same.Very tiresome reading. Very quick reading if that is the reason you would buy this one.You certainly know what the ending will be long before you get to the end."
2,Boring,"My 4 and 5 year olds played for about 3 minutes before losing interest. There's not much to do except drop the car in and hope it doesn't get stuck. No room for creative play or variation. Maybe a very young child will be amused to an extend that justifies the price, but to me it's just another piece of plastic junk that clutters the house and gathers dust."
3,Hard to keep together...,My son is six and he has a hard time putting pieces back on the track that come off frequently. Overall I would say that this toy is OK.
2,"Very, very annoying","The ""octopus"" has this highly irritating, thick NY accent, and says the same phrases over and over and over. My 3 boys think it's fun for about 15 minutes and then walk away. Glad I got it on clearance!"
2,Huey P.Newton: Prelude to a Revolution,The picture itself is not very clear. Just seems to ne just rambling on during the interview. Most of the documentary is an interview. I thought it was more footage on those turbulent times.
2,Disappointed,"I thought the video was too short to justify the expense, that the sound was of poor quality and that the understanding of what was going on and way was weak - unless you lived through those times. I did not - and that is why I got the DVD! So much for that experience. I would reference you to ""A Huey P. Newton Story"" Starring Roger Guenveur Smith."
2,Disappointed in Quality of Product,It appears that the book I received was a reproduction and not a real publication of the book. The cover was black and white and the pages had photocopy marks on them.
3,What Carreras said...,"I wish he had let go a real good one in Spanish!! But as some non Italian opera singers do, he swears in polite Italian, which definitely softens it for the cameras... He mutters ""Porco Iddio!"" (God, you pig!). What a wasted opportunity for a well placed VAFANCULO!!!Snappy orchestra, excellent chorus, lots of Lenny mugging and woefully miscast principals. Kurt Ollman sings an incongruously effeminate Riff while Te Kanawa and Carreras produce some lovely sounds in completely inadequate accents. Of course, these were the the opera superstars of the early 80's. Today, this would have been done with Fleming and Villazón with comparable results. Only the late great Tatiana Troyanos holds her own as an impassionate Anita.Still, lots of fun, great sound. Worth replacing your laserdisc or VHS."
1,not worth the money,"There's a shortage of good lesbian authors, so I won't be too harsh on Ms. Beers, but this book is really not worth the money. Her writing style, while not horrible, is rather amateurish and it's understandable why this book wasn't published by one of the major houses. I don't regret spending the money this time; I'm supporting the lesbian community, after all. But in the future I will stick with authors who've proven themselves worthy of my time: Nicola Griffith, Jeanette Winterson, Rita Mae Brown, et al."
5,The Best on the Market,This is the best general kayaking book on the market today (2001). Covers the range of the activity. Enjoy.
1,horrible costumer service and material,Do not even try...horrible costumer service trying to return this item. Finally contacted by a very rude person that kept on lying to me about their attempts to contact me. They finally did once I filed claim.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this CD knowing about 3 songs on the disk, and I like those songs. The remainder of the disk was very disappointing. I like Christian rock, but many of these songs the lead singer is screaming, which is not clever or interesting to me. I gave one star for the 3 good songs, the remainder of the disk is obnoxious in my opinion. To bad."
4,Great Christmas Movie,"We were looking for Christmas movies we hadn't seen, and definitely enjoyed this for a change from the usuals (Elf, Home Along, Christmas Vacation) playing on TV throughout November / December."
1,Never Got There For Me,"After reading all the glowing 5-star reviews for The Ref, I couldn't wait to watch it. I must have gotten a bootleg copy or something where all the funny stuff was left out. I'd think it was just that it didn't click with me personally, except my husband was watching too and he laughs at anything - stuff that makes me give him 'the look' - and he never laughed either. This is definitely a taste-specific movie. I don't know how to tell you what tastes will like it, because my husband and I are about as different as day and night in our movie choices, and neither of us cared for this dvd."
4,Hilariously funny !,"Not your pick for super comedians individually , but together Denis Leary, Judy Davis, Kevin Spacey, Robert J. Steinmiller Jr., Glynis Johns and cast will leave your ribs hurting from laughter ! Too much R rated language ,be fore warned !!"
5,Purrrrrrr,"An excellent book!! This is one of the best of the Mrs. Murphy series. As always, Tucker, Mrs. Murphy and Pewter are a riot - and in this book, we see much more of Simon the Opposum, who is another lovable character. This book has some rather grisly humor (I won't give away more) that really perked it up - as well as interesting interactions between the various humans. In these earlier books, Miranda is really a character, and she is a lot of fun that way (Brown tones her down a little too much in the later books). I would highly recommend this book - especially to pet lovers everywhere."
3,For gardeners in Australia,"This work aims to be a guide to the ornamental shrubs commonly grown in Australia. It seems to perform this task quite adequately and should also be usable in any area with a climate comparable to Australia. It does contain a few typically Australian shrubs which may be hard to obtain or grow outside of Australia, but these are few. Most of the shrubs treated are common to gardens worldwide.The color pictures which were added for the reprint (on separate pages) are decent, but small and quite orthodox."
3,beware of the night flier,"great short story from Stephen King adapted into a movie with Miguel Ferrer nontheless. basically about some murders and Ferrer goes on the hunt about this plane and a mysteryous secret that will be revealed to him in the end. the end is the highlight with all the bodies coming alive and then Ferrer sorta chops them into pieces and its all an illusion of the mind, that was great. for King buffs, others might want to steer clear of the ending if your sqeamish"
5,They finally got it right!,"This movie rocks, man. I'm so happy that they finally produced a Stephen King script almost entirely true to the original story. More than that. It's about 99% accurate. They added some stuff like a new female character played by Julie Entwistle, that wasn't in the book, but it turned out to be integral to the enhanced ending. Normally I'm very critical of people who watch these movies without having read the books first, but this time I think I can confidently say that even non-readers should like this movie. It's a masterpiece of suspense and gore. Rent it, folks, and call him the ""Night Flier."""
3,$30-$160 for THIS?,"Look, the short story was GREAT & I highly recommended reading it. That being said, this movie was entertaining but FAR FROM GREAT! You can find it at walmart or kmart ect for $6.00....it also is on cable from time to time.....DO NOT PAY MORE THEN 10 BUCKS FOR THIS MOVIE"
5,Old fashioned blood&guts,"This took me back to when I was small ,and got scared of shadows and an open closett in a dark beedroom , too scared to get out of bed to close it, too scared too call out for someone to come close it, too scared to close my eyes!, it brought back real horror, unlike most of the over worked horror of today!."
3,The Night Flier,Bought because it was a Stephen King movie. I'm collecting all his movies and books.
1,Not the quality you're used to,"First one arrived broken. No big deal, Amazon made the return quick and easy. Here's the problem. When we received the replacement we noticed that the lid and casserole don't match up perfectly. We thought this was a defect since le crueset products are top of the line and typically have a tight lid to base seal which is part of what makes them so great. Before returning this one too we did some research and found that this piece was not defective. Even on le cruesets website you can see this lid base gap in the photos, but only from the right angle and on specific colors. Most le crueset products are top of the line pieces that will cook beautifully and last a lifetime and then some. This piece is not one of those. It is a brittle, breakable, sloppily made piece. Most le cruesets are expensive but worth it. This one is not."
3,"Good, but not MIRACLE workers!","If you use these properly while taking care of your dog on a frequent basis, then they will do what they are designed to do, which is to keep the area around your dog's eyes clean. I used them as supposed with my lab, and he had beautiful hair around his eyes. In the other hand, my sister has a shitzu, and OMG, they never cleaned her eyes!! She is white and the hair around her eyes is like dark brown in color, simply terrible. I tried to help with these wipes, but like I said, they are not heavenly and don't work miracles. So these are not for out-of-hand situations, but rather for normal hygiene."
4,Exciting Adventure,"A Review by JohnThis book is about a troubled boy who keeps getting into trouble. When this story starts Rick is arrested for throwing 20 rocks at a stop sign because he was frustrated. This I thought was kind of a stupid reason but the book gets a lot better. He has no family, not many friends and he has lived in foster homes for along time since his grandmother's death. Check out this amazing exciting book!!!A few things I liked about this book were the adventures and the risks he takes such as in the ending which you will have to read to find out, he is very independent which is cool because he doesn't have to rely on anybody. Seeing how he is a teen like myself he has a lot more courage than me, because of all the things he has gone through. Another thing is the man who takes him in and helps him hide out, I thought that was pretty cool because the man helped him get away.All around great book check this out for sure!!!"
4,"OK, but a little boring in some areas.","If I could split stars, then I would give this book 4 and a half stars because I think it deserves more just 4. However, even though the plot has a nice twist with the hang gliding and endangered birds the storyline gets a little boring after a while. Why? Well, because the book contains to many boring subjects that I don't care about. It would of been fine if the author didn't mentoin these things and just stayed on topic.Overall, good book and not a bad read. I reccomend it to all those fans of Wilson Rawls and action/adventure books. If intrested in neither, this probably isn't a book for you."
4,Happy,"This is one of my all time favorite movies,not easy to find in any video store but if you are a fan of Keenan Ivory Wayans(which I am)you will definitely love this movie. I received my order very fast and was able to enjoy it with others."
1,A genius?,"A genius? I doubt it! He talks a lot of mess and doesn't back it up. This is the second time I bought a Kanye West album and both times I was screwed out of 15 dollars! Stick to stealing tracks Kanye, and leave the rhymes to people who can spit. You got a second chance after you dropped the mediocre College Dropout, but I'm not gonna be fooled into buying another album again. I'm out!"
5,BEST ALBUM OF '05,"Kanye's Done It AgainWhen I first heard The College Dropout last year I thought it was the best CD I had ever heard. I was so excited to get Late Registration, and I was not disappointed. I just got the CD today and I have listened to it at least 5 times. This CD is as good as The College Dropout if not better. Late Registration is the best album of 2005. Everybody who loves Hip-Hop should get this CD. Do not be discouraged by the parental advisory because this CD has great messages about getting goals accomplished and living your life to the fullest.My Favorite Songs:Heard 'Em SayGold DiggerDiamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix)Touch The SkyGonePLUS the Skits are hilarious"
1,Heard It all Before!,"Worthless album! Listening to this is like tuning your radio to the past, listening to some dudes rapping over old music. Kayne has to step up his game, his style is getting boring and predictable. You wanna impress me, do an album without using 100 other artist! But this crap will sell because there's really nothing eles to offer in the rap industry!"
3,what about the @$$,"touch the sky is the worst video I've ever seen in my life! but this CD has aight songs though he has nothing on the king of rap, 2pac, wish he was here today I would have loved to see what kind of comments he would make about mr. golddigger"
1,I just don't get it....,"Why do people love this guy so much? I honestly have never liked even one of his songs. He is terrible. Go listen to a song like Diamonds and ask yourself is that really ""rap""? Kanye West's music is way more pop than rap. I just wish my man Biggie and 2Pac were still here so we could listen to some real rap music from people with actual talent. Don't support talentless people like Kanye West. If you want to buy a real rap CD buy Ready to Die, the debut masterpiece by the late great Notorious B.I.G.Kanye sucks."
2,Kanye sells out,"I loved College Dropout. Dope, dope album. Remember when Kanye compared himself to Tribe? WTF happened Kanye? His ego took over and in his quest to attain classic status he made a generic new-school, overly commercial rap album that is just plain terrible. Alright there's a few good songs on here but NONE of them are as good as the stand-out tracks from Dropout. Thanks for putting another nail in hip-hop's coffin Kanye, props."
4,It's too bad he's not fluent in Cantonese because his playfulness and innate cuteness would go over big in China.,"Not every song is an Ipod keeper but the entire album is entertaining which is rare these days and there's something really amusing about Kanye West. If he were multilingual and could sing in Chinese (why would he want to, right?) he'd be appropriately appreciated by a large foreign audience. Of the non-hits, I only kept Hey Mama but this is one of the few albums that didn't make me regret that I didn't just buy the hit single(s) instead."
3,Kanye should stick to Producing,"Kanye is alright, best song on this cd is ""Crack Music"" if u like layed back rap music, then i guess u would like this cd."
2,Not all that,"I borrowed this cd from a friend and I didnt like it. It annoys me when he raps and he cant seem to catch his breath. At times he sounds like he just came back from running a marathon and recorded the album right after. He samples tooooo much. I mean its ok to sample here and there once in a while but he just does it too much. Dude, get your own music. The song goldigger was cool for about a week but then it just got old too fast. His lyrics are cool though, but I heard somewhere that he doesnt write his own lyrics. Maybe its just rumors, I dunno. Thank You"
2,Should'nt have registered at all!!,"He should have just dropped out. He sound like he tryna do too much wit his music now. It dont sound soul or upliftin like at first. Sound like some,""Turn on any beat and see if I can catch it"" $@!#. Go buy a new hat or sum'n instead."
4,A Music Listeners CD.,"Good job Kanye. I really thought this was going to be some garbage, but I was hooked on the first listen. Let's keep it in perspective. He is not a gangsta rapper. He is a PRODUCER that raps, now that I think about it he raps better than 95% of the rappers. WHO CANNOT FEEL HEY MAMA SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SONG. Give him credit for being a very creative force in the rap industry. The male Missy Elliot. Stay true to yourself Kanye. I personal appreciate it."
5,No Sophmore Jinx here!!!!!,"Late Regustration is'nt an album where u can just skim through all the tracks and then judge weather its good or bad (like most people). This is on of the best (if not the best) albums in 2005 an not just in hiphop, but overall. I can tell Kanye took his time with this album. Even the skits are original and kinda funny. I have one big problem with one of the tracks on there and thats Crack Music. I like The Game and I was really looking foward to him spitting A few bars and to my surprise...... well you have to go find out. And Twista does'nt makes it on here neither, but On the other hand there was a major surprise guest that caught me off guard (cuz I didn't look to see who was on the track) and thats Nas. Yeah Nas on a Rocafella track nuff said (or typed). Late Registration is full of good music for everyone. No fan of hiphop/rap should be without this classic!!"
4,Good album,This album is Fly its more musically oriented which I can appreciate Kanye is killin it I hope this will weed out all the wack music from real music...Peace to Kanye...
4,"if you like Kanye Wests first CD, ""College Dropout"" then BUY THIS CD!!!","This CD is so hot. I bought it the day it came out and it is definitely worth the money. I can really appreciate the lyrics in his music because he's not like other rappers that are ""f"" this and ""f"" that. He doesn't discriminate or talk about other rappers in a bad way to gain publicity. I can totally respect him and his music. I saw him in an interview on MTV with Sway and he stated that everyone thought he was going to be an artist not a musician. To me he is an artist. The CD hasn't left my CD player since I bought it. The only thing that I would change is replace some of the skits with music. There is one skit I think everyone can appreciate that says, ""We can't afford no gas, so we ain't driving."" I thought that was hilarious. Go out and get this CD if you haven't already. If you liked his first CD THIS IS EVEN BETTER. My favorite song is the one with Cameron."
5,Greatest Of All Time,"After years of directing, a near fatal car crash, an amazing album that was snuffed by almost everyone, Kanye Returns and as the song says hes back with his new Sh*t and it sounds like the best of. This is hands down the best CD of 2005 and if this doesnt win any grammys there truly on drugs!! Kanye West is the best rapper there is right now and he continues to build his reputation with another BANGING Album"
1,Jesus Certainly Does Walk! And I think he's a rapper! Bow Down To Mr. West!,"Probably one of the best records of all time. Kanye West goes to outshine every hip hopster ever with this album and his amazing rhymes and lyrics. Probably my favorite part of this album occurs on the hit single ""Gold Digger"" with Kanye's buddy Ra...Jamie Foxx.In this amazing feat of skillz, Kanye rhymes ""18 years"" with ""18 years"" in the line:""18 years, 18 yearsShe got one of yo kids got you for 18 years""He then follows it up with an even more amazing task of rhyming ""money"" with ""money"" with ""money"" and follows it up with rhyming all 3 ""money's"" with one more ""money"", as follows:""She was spose to buy ya shorty TYCO with ya moneyShe went to the doctor got lypo with ya moneyShe walkin around lookin like Micheal with ya moneyShould of got that insured got GEICO for ya money""!AMAZING! Bring on the Grammys!"
1,I wasn't impressed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I like Kanye West, but I was really dissappointed with thisCD, the only song on this CD that really appealed to mewas ""Goldigger""."
1,WTF????!!!!,"What happened to Kanye West and College Dropout that was a classic. This is just awful and garbage. The beats the lyrics and even the guests were bad lyrically. I used to respect him not now. I mean come on you need Maroon 5 to help your album that is sad. Get some real rap like Ice Cube, Tupac, or DMX."
4,Hooray 4 Kanye!!,"I enjoyed the first one, but this one is better. Great CD to listen to, in its entirety. Could have done without the skits (skits are so...1990ish). If you don't already have this one, you are missing out."
1,"good music, but .................","the idea is great, this serie of 14 cd albums brings back the more unknown black dance music from the 80's in the 12"" versions.Digitally remastered, but they forget to tell you that they remastered from the vinyl singles not from the original mastertapes. In some cases it sounds ok, but in many the sound is wack!!. If you like this kind of music but also love HQ-sounddon't buy this!!."
5,Why buy beer when you can make it?,"People say this book is difficult to comprehend, but this is your book if you sincerely want to learn how to brew and want to learn the reasoning behind every step, ingredient, and equipment use."
4,"Its a detailed book , well worth look !","I haven`t had time to read whole book , but what I have read is great , I dont know of a beer brewing book out there , thats give`s you all the fact`s, this one come`s very close . well worth the look ."
1,Don't buy the Kindle version,"This review is on the format, not the contents.While the author's text is widely regarded as one of the best available guides or introductions to homebrewing, this book is a disaster in Kindle format. The links to illustrations invariably do not work, and there is no table of contents to help guide the reader. Kindle works well for books that are flat text, but not a how-to manual like this where the reader will often refer back to certain parts of the text, but not necessarily read in a linear fashion. I wish I could return this for a refund, but Amazon doesn't give me the option to do so. Avoid this book in the Kindle format and buy the print version instead."
5,Nice confidence booster for beginers,"After you brew a few batches, you will realize that this is largely necessary, as all of this information can be found online at this point. But for me it was a necessary confidence booster for and found it convenient to have all of the basic information one needs for home-brewing consolidated in one locations in a readable manner. This is very well written, geared towards the novice."
4,Terse but very good,"This textbook for advanced undergraduates or first-year graduate students leads the reader through the basic concepts and statistical procedures of econometrics. The extensive use of matrix notation allows the reader to easily apply Goldberger's formulae to actual data (especially with computer packages such as Gauss and Matlab). Although the author gives brief treatments which sometimes require several readings to be fully understood, he is by no means unclear or confusing. Quite the contrary, as the book is very concise. Sections which I found especially useful and interesting were: 22.5 Statistical versus Economic Significance, 23 Multicollinearity (actually humorous!), and 24 Regression Strategies."
1,Despair all who have to use this book,"This is possibly one of the worst textbooks I have ever read. I had to use this book in a graduate level econometrics class and found it very difficult to follow: poorly written, counterintuitive, and with a confusing choice of statistical notation. We only used about the first half of the book. A much better book is Rice's Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis."
2,Dark and Ponderous,"I'm afraid I was disappointed by this first volume in a series which is already projected to 5 volumes. The plot background, basically a reverse v'ger with an ounce or two of X-files, unfolds in truly tedious fashion. Action occurs in short jerky motions. Tunnel chases get interrupted for philosophical soliliquies, etc. Conspiracy lovers will have a ball, however. The writer picks up on all the old theories and adds dashes of aliens where you would never expect them. Literally nothing is as it seems. If you like dark, baroque, excrutiatingly complex settings this will be a series you might come to love. Our best hope here is that this ponderous writing is corrected in later volumes by other authors and that the core story becomes a rich source of invention. In the meantime, I'm pretty sure you will have to read volume 1 to be able to follow what's coming."
2,Not enough fans,"My one thing about this documentary is that it is called ""Lord of the Fans"" but the majority of it doesn't have your average everyday fan. I was hoping to see more of what I experienced and what I saw... but I didn't. They only went to one Line Party, and, in fact, they didn't even really talk about Line Parties all that much. Most of the interviewees were famous people with little tiny inserts from fans here and there. Most of the documentary part was overly cheesy and the graphics were rather mediocre. I was hoping for something more. I didn't get it.I actually had preordered this item, but someone I knew had a preview copy that I got to see and I cancelled my order after seeing it. I was not overly impressed. With all the hype I just thought it was going to be so much better. I didn't want another documentary that's like many that I already own. I was hoping for something fresh."
2,Ok Short Story,This was an ok read to me it didn't really do it for me but it was an ok read for me to pass the time. In my opinion you should borrow the book versus buying it. Granted this was a short story the book seems rushed and didn't really leave me feeling complete in reference to the ending of the book.
4,a great book for high school starters,"A matter of Trust is a great book for high school starters because it talks about teens in high school who are beginning to learn the real value of trust. The main character, Darcy, has a close friend, Hakeem. She isn't sure if he is her boyfriend or just a friend. Her ex-friend, Brisana, is trying to make a move on Hakeem. Darcy doesn't know if she is just trying to take Hakeem becausae Darcy left her for new friends that Brisana doesn't think are good enough for Brisana. This book has a unique plot because it's not something you may read but it's something you may see going on in real life sometimes. This book is suspenseful and memorable."
4,Tasty Array,"Thriller is a platter of thirty superb, unique and varied hors derive. One finds proscuitto with melon all the way to caviar with baby swiss with many other varieties, tastes and spices between. Many and varied tastes are tempted by these bite sized stories. As others have compared this to the ""Forrest Gumpish, box of chocolates"" one knows these confections are neither sweet nor nutty after the first taste. These are true mysteries and thrillers of the first order with authors offering everything from two wonderful historical vignettes through detectives, spies, good scares, and even one Marxist theme spy story. This is a new genre of fiction and thereby gives teasers into these varied authors' style and flavor. This is not just an ordinary anthology of short stories or a digest version of longer novels. I find this a well-done must read and a most difficult book to describe to others. Readers must try this for themselves or miss a very tasty array."
2,Blah,"I thought this was going to contain chilling short stories. I wanted goosebumps and a racing heart. My reaction instead was of disappointment and let down. Most of the writing itself is excellent and the stories are full of irony and twists, but I wouldn't classify them as thrillers. If you're looking for ""scary stories"" this book does not contain them."
5,Laugh!,I recommend this book to those who like to laugh. I definitely think that it's UNBELIEVABLE. It was just the funniest and most entertaining book I've ever seen before. Be ready!!!
2,Disappointing,"Publish and Perish has all the basic elements of a good mystery and the setting has some appeal, but this story turned out to be rather flat. The characters are developed reasonably well, but the story line is pretty thin. The only real action or suspense occurs right at the end and only when the murderer is uncovered and confronted by the protagonist, Ben Reese. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe it's because this was the author's first mystery novel, but I found it quite dull and uninspiring. I probably would have put it down and not picked it up again if it had been a longer story. Contrary to another reviewer, I find this author has a long way to go before her mysteries can be likened to those of the greats such as Agatha Christie. Maybe the subsequent stories in the Ben Reese series are much better, but I was disappointed enough by this one that I probably won't be checking out that possibility."
1,No Clue,I had severe agoraphobia and panic disorder. I ordered the tapes and I can honestly say they were worthless and a waste of money. I had also ordered Dr Claire Weekes books and tapes and they were the best thing that happened to me. Do not waste your money on any of Lucinda Bassett's materials.Former Agoraphobic
3,Worth watching!,This is a dvd worth watching to see different views and its also interesting to see how the public is still being kept confused and given MISinformation to avoid the truth.
1,More Posner Disinformation,"This DVD has little to do with any ""secret KGB files""; it is largely bombast constructed from stock footage. Although it seems to give equal time to respected critics of the Warren Report like Mark Lane and Robert Groden, it belongs on the shelf next to the Posner whitewash as it continues to support our greatest national public lie. A genuine waste of money. Anton Vodvarka, Hartly DE"
4,Guide to Caterpillars field resource pocket book,"This is a good little book, although not terribly comprehensive. But considering the fact that there are hardly any field guides on the market relating to butterfly and moth larvae identification, I give this book a thumbs up! Illustrations and information is very helpful and accurate."
5,Sexy smooth,"Many different tracks for whatever mood,great collection of Keiko hits.The Flame the standout to me."
4,"While not as good as Raymond Chandler, McDonald still delivers some solid entertaining noir crime novels.","In my opinion nobody wrote noir crime novels as well as the great Raymond Chandler. In fact, I don't believe anyone even comes close.That said, McDonald is definitely the second best writer in this genre.Its a solid entertaining book."
3,Fair to Middlin',"Look, I like Ross MacDonald, I really do. I've read the majority of the Archer series and have been mostly entertained by it. The set-ups and pay-offs are somewhat intriguing and the character development is adequate. Still, The Galton Case is no better or worse than other MacDonald novels. The formula just gets tiresome after so many books. Case presented, interview, interview, red herring, interview, Archer (shot at, cold-cocked, sapped), re-interview, suspect emerges, case closed. Yet the novels do have merit. BUT to mention him in the same breath as Chandler and Hammett is a bit of a stretch. MacDonald relies heavily on metaphor, so much so that they become distracting. In one novel, I counted no less than 15 within the first 25 pages and the other books are very similar. So here's the deal. If you're looking for gumshoe lite, Archer is your guy. A decent little series to help you while away the time until something really good comes along."
4,Larnelle Live Is Lively!,I purchased this CD when it first came out almost 13 years ago and it sounds just as good. Brought back a lot of memories. Got to me in excellent condition and quickly from seller.
4,Love the focus on the core group,"While I enjoy the 'story of the week', I am definitely liking this season's focus on the key players in this drama. Seeing how the past five seasons have really taken their toll on the group's dynamic has added another level to this already terrific cast. Sharon Gless's portrayal of the aggrieved but still loyal Madeline has been stellar, and I actually felt like Sam was human, instead of just a caricature, last week, watching him say goodbye to Elsa."
2,What happened to the fun?,"I used to love Burn Notice because it was fun. Now with the more serious story lines and Michael's penchant for revenge, no matter what the cost, has really caused the show to go downhill. I think they made mistakes at making Fiona a serious live-in girlfriend, and letting Madeline in out of the dark. It's kind of like having James Bond change from Pierce Brosnan to Daniel Craig. Still worth watching, but not nearly as fun."
3,What is going on?,I love this show. It's the only TV show that I have truly ever really liked this much. But this episode did kind of stink. I expected a lot more after Nate's death. The part with Sam and Jesse with the loan shark was kind of nil and they should've been working with Michael to try to find out who killed Anson/Nate. Hope the next one holds a bit more excitement. I'm assuming this is the last season so I do hope it goes out with a bang and wraps up neatly in a nice little bow of excitement.
1,NEVER Deviate From A Winning Formula,"I LOVED this show (past tense)...up until this season. They deviated from their winning formula and tried to turn it into high drama, and it is an epic fail. Then they made it worse by taking several months off before airing the rest of the season. I watched Burn Notice because it had characters that were interesting, yet flawed, and that a viewer could actually like. This season, I don't care about any of them. The writers turned Michael into a cold blooded killer and the rest of the cast into ho-hum partners. Did they get new writers this season? I'm so sad to see one of my favorite shows ruined by poor writing. Oh well, we still have seasons 1-5. I guess I'll re-watch them."
2,Episode 13 of Season 6 .. NOT THERE,I could not watch episode 13 because it is only a 29 second clip. I want the actual episode i paid for.I want it fixed.
5,Burn Notice,"Really love, love, love this show! Never a boring minute. Great acting, direction, has stayed true to it's original premise."
4,Love the exercises; layout could be a tad better,"The book gives good yoga poses for moms, and I like the suggestions for things you can do with your baby. My boy really likes it! I wish the book were spiral-bound so that it would lay flat on the floor next to me, and I wish the page layouts were tuned a little better to the progression of poses - very minor complaints, especially once you've done the classes a few times and get the routine down."
4,Quite Good . . . Nicely Staged,"Though not as romantic or adventurous as the 1968 and 1996 versions, this take on the star-crossed lovers follows the text much closer (but still edits out a few lines here and there). No standout performances, as everyone in the cast does a credible job. One curiosity: the actress Juliet looks and sounds much older than the teenager she was originally written to be. Romeo and his cronies work well together, and fiery-haired Tybalt is just plain mean.Performed as an Elizabethan period piece with simple but effective staging and costumes. Directors of amateur theater groups should give this version a gander."
4,One Quiet Moment,"You've got to hear this song tract from this CD. It has been playing in my head all day. The lyrics are great. The melody is smooth yet powerful. I find myself becoming more intimate with Mary and Joseph the parents of Jesus - all because of this song. The other songs are pretty good, too, but THIS song is a must listen to. You'll be refreshed and encouraged when you do."
1,This review is for people who like actual content in the books they read,"I can understand where someone would enjoy the imagery and message of this book. Blah, blah, blah. I read for entertainment, and this was NOT entertaining. You can see from my other reviews that I really enjoy the Janet Evanovich series, the Sookie series, and pretty much any entertaining new book that comes out. I got this book to read before I saw the movie. By page 150 I wanted to pull my eyelashes out one by one just to keep from falling asleep. This is the only book I can ever remember not finishing, and I've read some doozies. Save yourself the time and money and read ANYTHING else."
4,Exceptional Characterizations,"Richard Yates is a supreme word crafter. No sentence is wasted in his story telling. The reader feels as if s/he is right there in the room with each personality even to the point of knowing the scent of the individual. Yates is one of the best I've ever read in creating 3-dimensional characters.Yet the story itself leaves one feeling the futility of life, and that is not a pleasant place especially for today's readers struggling to make sense of it all. There seems to be no joy in the world Yates creates, only occasional self-delusional moments of light-heartedness in contemplating an inevitably impossible escape. One is left with hopeless despair - misery.For those readers who are searching for perfection in characterization perhaps for their own writing development, this book will amaze you. For those looking for inspirational escape from the daily rat race, you will have wasted your time with this book."
1,HATED it!,"This book is filled with evocative prose that evokes tedious, boring, mundane, desperately unfulfilled life in 50's suburbia. I cannot imagine why anyone would want to read it."
2,Revolutionary Road,"A wonderful writer...story is auto-biographical which helps because it is otherwise uninteresting and dull. The two stars are for the writing, not the story. Yates was 35 when he wrote this and had such insight into his male characters. Not much with females, but then it was the 50's...and he was a male! The movie, I am told, ends quite differently. Even so, I don't think I'll bother seeing it."
2,ANNOYING,This book was so annoying. I don't understand all the high reviews. I wanted to jump in the book and strangle April. What a self-centered b***h. I will probably be stupid enough to rent the movie but only in the hopes they drastically change the story.
3,Revolutionary Road,"I just couldn't connect with these characters and found myself thinking of them as horrible and depressing and even selfish. I think the story itself was well written. Obviously the author did a better job than I could ever do, but the conversations between the Wheelers and their attitude of how they are above their neighbors and friends kind of put me off. There were parts of the story, I forced myself to read through and other parts where I thought it was just ""ok"", The ending was tragic, which put me of. I did find some of Yates words entrancing and his descriptions captivating. I had higher hopes for this book"
4,Shoes,"Shoes are comfortable to walk around in or short distance running, but not long distance running."
4,wedding time,There is going to be a wedding and the little girl who is the main character in the story has been asked to be the flower girl! She is really excited. She gets to dress up in a pretty dress and walk down the aisle in front of her aunt. It's a very important job. She starts to think that it might be to hard. She thinks she might not to a good enough good. She gets scared. She talks with her family about it and they make her feel much better.The little girl shared her feelings with her aunt about being scared. This shows kids that when you have scared feelings it's ok to talk with a grown up about them.I would recommend this book families who are getiing ready to have weddings. The book will be a great way to bring up discussions on lots of wedding matters like mammers and feelings about weddings.
3,Whre did they get all the money?,I haven't actually finished reading this beautiful facsimile. It looks great! But at first glance it omits some very important details. It's a touch facile - as are so many other accounts of the back story in the purchase of the vast Louisiana Territory. It was a highly complex transaction facilitated by Barings Brothers Bank in London and Hopes Bank in Amsterdam. Most of the transaction was in place in the brief hiatus in Napoleon's war with England. But the completion took place when Napoleon resumed that war.Barings and Hopes did very well from the deal - charging interest to both France and America for their services - 'tho Alexander Baring could very well have faced a charge of treason for rushing remaining funds to Napoleon (on Jefferson's behalf) while England was again at war with France. Complicated and great fun. All manner of 'what ifs' if the deal had reached stalemate. Thought I'd just say!
3,not that interesting,"this is same old mediocre stuff Ben has been putting out since around Burn to Shine....its too bad too, I used to get really inspired by his music too."
4,Excellent Product,"This is an excellent product for the person who enjoys apples. In fact, this is the best canned apple that I have found. I gave it a rating of 4 only because of the problem I have had in locating it in the stores that carry the Polar line of products. Many stores stock mandarin orange slices and mixed fruit, while few seem to stock the Fuji apples. The apples are crisp and have a fresh apple taste. The caloric content(50 calories in a half cup)is low enough for this product to be an ideal ""dessert"" for a weight loss program. I prefer the 29 oz can which is either no longer produced or even more difficult to find than the 15 oz can. All things considered, I feel the search for Polar Fuji Apples, is well worth the effort."
3,Reverse of Medal,This novel had a little more personal activities and less naval activities than I would prefer.
2,Why on Earth ?,"WHy on Earth would someone write a biography about Johnny Depp ? Is the biography market so good that it makes it worthwhile for the profits ? Anywa, Johnny is a great actor, independent and careful with his screenplay choices. ""ED WOOD"", ""EDWARD SCISSORHANDS"", ""SLEEPY HOLLOW"" .. all are great proof of his talents. THe book is good, but nothing more thatn that. If you're a Depp fan, stick with his movies."
2,Doesn't relate much to my experience,"I was hoping this would help me figure out how to have a better relationship with my lit agent, but it simply didn't have enough relevance to my experience. I think this has a lot to do with it being written mainly from an actor's agent perspective. And while the author throws in tidbits about how this is supposed to relate to the lit world, there just isn't enough depth. Nor does it seem is it written for someone at the beginning of their lit career where what you can expect from an agent is simply different (based on my experience and that of my friends in similar stages of their careers). Finally, there is nothing in the book about directors which i am first, even before a writer."
2,"Sticky, goopy, underwhelming","I purchased this product because I was trying to eliminate the aluminum in my deodorant, however this product is not the answer for me. While I think of lavendar as a feminine scent, this has a masculine smell to it. The product goes on and stays sticky all day long until it rubs off on your clothes. It possibly helps with odor control some, but it is not as effective as I would like. I tried it twice and threw it away.I would not recommend."
1,Made my armpits peel!,"I bought this item since I love Lavender and wanted a more natural dedordant. I actually liked it the first time I put it on. Went on easy and I liked the smell. However after a few days of use I noticed I wasn't smelling as great as when I used Dove or other typical brands. Then I noticed that it was burned my skin a little when putting it on, very tingly. For whatever reason I used it for another day and thats when the peeling started. My pits now look like an 80 year olds (very dry and wrinkly) and has been shedding. Looks like I had a severe sunburn and every part of the skin is flaking and peeling away. Super gross. I used the product for a week and that was it for me. I wont be finishing the stick. What a waste."
4,Much better than the original formula,"I tried this product, and it works much better than the original (non-long-lasting) formula. The original formula I had to scrub under my arms with a washcloth, and then I might have a chance of making it through the workday. The long lasting version gets me through the day without smelling. One thing I noticed was the long-lasting version is much softer, so I'm probably using more of it (which is why the 4 stars instead of 5). The lemongrass version is also much nicer than the woodspice, which I had been using."
3,worth it,Okay so I've recently decided to change to a healthier life style. Well going along my journey I've decided to give up harmful deodorants. Today is my first day wearing Tom's. I put it on around 5pm I had to re apply at midnight. Its not too bad actually. I'm not sweating as I expected. However I re-applied because I started to feel a little moisture in that area. I'm a pretty heavy sweater under the arms. Odor is under control. I will purchase again. Id rather re apply then to suffer and deal with the effects of wearing commercial deodorants.
2,:(,I was so excited to use this deo but was very disappointed. This was the very first natural one i have ever tried but...it made me underarms very very dry and itchy. I have never had this reaction with any other deo. :( Now im going to try kiss my face. Wish me luck
5,long lasting natural deoderant,"Toms work wonders for me, They glide on cleanly, and does exactly what it advertized. I have not had a stinky day yet since using Toms of Maine natural deodorant. I have my husband using it now too."
1,Inappropriate for any child-- should be considered child abuse.,"I was given this book as a child by a well meaning school counselor after the passing of a classmate. This book completely screwed with my head, along with the heads of my former classmates. Why in the would would you give a child who has experienced a loss a character to bond with only to have him die at the end too? It's cruel. Great for adults, sure, even possibly OK for adults to borrow verbiage from to discuss death with children. Completely inappropriate to give to children to explore on their own.I had nightmares for years, fixated on my ultimate demise rather than a healthy grieving process.Here's a thought-- talk to the children instead of passing them a book. Answer their questions, deal with being uncomfortable, know that it's OK to say ""I don't know."""
3,Freddie the leaf,It was good but not really what I was looking for in the since of how I would expalin death. I was looking more for a biblical aspect of death. this told more of the physical death but the thought of loosing someone you love how can you feel them and the love that they gave you.
5,Healing,"This book touches the heart and fills you with hope in the never ending experience of love. The focus of this story is about love, and how love enables us to face some of life's most difficult challenges. It is a book about change, death, and transition. The Fall of Freddie the Leaf should be on the bookshelves of anyone going through change, loss, and transition. Enjoy!I also recommend: What the Dying Teach Us: Lessons on Living by Samuel Oliver"
5,Not just for children!,"I recently lost a very dear friend and was not dealing with my grief very well. Another friend loaned me her copy of The Fall of Freddie the Leaf: A Story of Life for All Ages. She assured me that it would help, and it did. The book is simply simple and gracefully puts into perspective the inevitablity of death. I have since purchased several copies that I have sent to friends and family who've grieved loved ones. You will love the soothing illustrations and tender language of this book!!"
5,FASCINATING READING!,"Got Reggae Routes as a Christmas gift and it was a wonderful read - well researched, well written and consistently entertaining. A must for any fan of Jamaican music. I would like to have seen more on reggae abroad and on the great instrumentalists, but this book certainly tells the best story of Jamaican music I've ever seen. It may not be perfect but it's certainly better than anything else out there."
3,Best Read in Bits and Pieces,"After reading the ecstatic reviews on Amazon.com, I went right out and bought myself a copy of this book. Alas, it's quite a disappointment: while the way the authors break down their survey in terms of singles is appealing, the book in general is somewhat lacking in historical and sociological context. At many points it is clear that the authors had a difficult time writing comments for a particular single, and would fall back on rather inane, undergraduate writing-workshop observations. It is clear as well that much of their commentary is cobbled together, somewhat clumsily, from other people's interviews and articles. (The same method is apparent in the artwork, with lots of blurry .jpgs badly enlarged to fit the layout.) The book fares better in the first 80 pages, when the essays delve into more of Jamaican music history. But this is by no means ""the best book ever written on reggae,"" as they say on the back cover blurb."
4,Interesting and well laid out,"This book features pictures of details from extant ethnic costumes from more than fifty countries. Next to each picture is a flat (line drawing) of the whole garment, which allows you to see construction and some stitching details, as well as the overall shape. Descriptions alongside each flat include mention of the gender, class, time period, and ethnicity of a person who might wear the garment, as well as a context in which they might do so.The organization is a little odd, since it relates to the particular detail featured (e.g. ""Necklines"", or ""Pleats and Gathers"") but the index allows a search by place, which is very helpful. It also includes a map, glossary, and suggestions for further readings. Students interested in cultural dress will enjoy this brief introduction, though for more in-depth studies of a region, they should look into other resources."
2,A disappointment for this Greene fan,"I've read a handful of his books and loved every one, except this one. The characters are not as fleshed out as in his other novels and not one is really likeable.As always Greene is a great storyteller, or at least starts out here with a great tale but the plot simply ceased to interest me midway through the book. I found this one nowhere near the greatness of ""The Heart of the Matter"" or ""The End of the Affair"". If you haven""t yet, read those!!!"
3,This book has me dead already...,"The book is nice and serves it's purpose. The only thing I don't like is it has my husband and I dead already. We are listed in the past tense. ""My father was, My mother was."" I plan on showing it to my son before I'm dead so I just put a line through it, but geez this book has me dead already."
3,Half and half,"Not a bad CD. The song selections were decent, covering a number of tracks across all the of different albums Breaking Benjamin has done. Some folks remarked about the studio mastering, and I tend to agree it was editted and produced in a poor way. There could have been much more to the performances that weren't portrayed well."
2,what just happened??,"ok, we rent this thing as a joke hoping it would classic ""b"" material. What we got is a movie that functions too much on a stupid plot. 2 stars because of the monster box on the boat. Way too funny. Nice narrator too. The ending where the narrator feels it nessecary to say that ""his sister showed him love too"" or something to that effect."
1,"SORRY MOVIE FANS, THIS FILM SUCKS!!!","Rutger Hauer is the only reason to see this movie if you do at all. If you are one of his fans, this may turn you against him. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this abomination, it's boring, pointless, and the plot is kind of stupid. The box cover cost more than the film, that should say it all..."
1,Pitiful...........,"I had such high hopes for this movie. It was reviewed in Fangoria years ago under the title ""Hemoglobin"" and, of course, they showed all the best pictures from it. The effects are WONDERFUL!, as seen on the cover of the box. I'll bet just by looking at the nasty little things on the cover, that you would want to see this. Too bad you don't even get to see them until the very end, and they are such quickly shot, that you never get to see them as good as you do on the cover. This movie is drenched in horrible dialogue that could make a crack-pumped mokey fall asleep. Just don't be fooled by the gimmicky ""bleeding"" cover like I sure the average person would, and you'll be ok."
4,"A bit of a shock, but it is signature Alec Empire!","When I got Alec Empire's new cd, The Futurist, I was shocked that it was full of guitars and not the usual ""sampled guitars"" and uber-heavy distorted electronic beats I love Digital Hardcore for. But, after a second listen, I am hooked to this CD!! The stand out tracks for me are Kiss of Death (#1) and Vertigo (#6). If you are sick and tired of the cliched punk scene and the every growing boring electronic scene, check out The Futurist. Trust me, you will see the future and it doesn't look all that good! At least you can thrash to it with impunity!"
4,Easy to use.,"Substantial tool that works well and is quick to make perfect knurls in aluminum, steel, brass and other materials. Turns out perfect work."
2,not great,"This drill lasted a year, but i didn't use it daily. It did see some hard use, as it was mostly used to drill out broken grade 10.9 bolts. It drilled out a lot of them to its credit, until the planetary gears finally gave out while drilling aluminium ironically. I kept it greased and oiled. I contacted jet for replacement parts, which they do not offer. So it went in the trash as a waste of money. It may be ok for lighter duty use such as drilling wood, but if you need a drill that will work hard for you, get a serviceable one from a tool truck which you won't have to throw away."
5,Motorola W385 Cell Phone Car Charger,"The Motorola W385 Cell Phone Car Charger works great and is exactly what I expected! I am very pleased with it, the new cell phone battery and the company I bought them through on Amazon.com...both arrived promptly and in excellent condition!"
5,great charger,We were glad to find this charger was available. It wasso cheap and shipping was reasonable. Great company andproduct.
5,Best case!,"This is the best case I've ever had for any camera I've owned. I can say that because I've taken the time to practice getting it out of the case quickly, so now it's second nature.The fit is awesome, and I didn't need the instructions even the first time. I even took the risk and dropped it 6 inches onto the wooden table. No thud or crack at all. An unprotected camera has a chance of breaking even at that short height. I feel confident my camera will survive my adventures, as I like to take a lot of pictures outdoors."
2,Non-functional,"Luckily, this case came with my camera, because I never would have purchased it on my own. It is EXTREMLY difficult to actually get the camera out of the case; anyone who says differently either has no experience with other camera cases, or is simply trying to justify a frustrating purchase. No provisions for extra batteries, lens filters, or anything but the camera itself, and then when you'd like to actually use the camera, you have to find a place to put the case, as it has no strap itself, and you must completely remove the camera from the case to use it. That being said, it is at least construction wise very sound, and seems to protect the camera well. I recommend the other Sony case that is for both the 828 and 717, it does have provisions for other camera tools (chamois, filters, batteries, memory sticks, you get the idea), its own dedicated strap, and the camera is very easy to pull out in a quick moment. Don't buy this case, end of story."
1,Not for a heavy user,"I'm a touch typist, typing at 60+ wpm and found this keyboard very frustrating. It seemed to miss letters. If I try to enter multiple ctrl key sequences, it wouldn't take them, recognizing the first ctrl key, but not the subsequent one. I'd have to release the ctrl key after the first selection and re-press it for the second one to register.I also had trouble with multiple selections using ctrl-click to select them. I'd start selecting a few items and then all of a sudden, I'd see only one item selected.I'm running flat panel monitors. If I put the receiver on the desk, but behind the flat panels, the keyboard would not work (total distance from receiver was about 12 inches). The receiver had to be in front of the monitors.The Mouse software would not install on Windows XP 64-bit. Note that MS does not say this driver is 64-bit compatible. Kind of disappointing that their own product doesn't support Windows properly."
1,Bad Choice!!!,"Totally usless keyboard and mouse!! Looks like it was dug out of a dumster somewhere. Keys fell off in box...dent in hand rest..mouse would not work at all..dirty finger prints all over limited instructions,no batterys, I'll never deal with them again...for sure!! They should send me a new one for free...no custemer support as well>>>"
3,More Harper than Blind Boys....,"I was expecting the Blind Boys of Alabama to have a greater profile in the concert, they are back-up to Harper's concert. If you are a fan of the Blind Boys of Alabama it will leave you wishing they had been spotlighted more."
5,Can I Get an Amen???,"I can't say enough about this WONDERFUL DVD. I've been listening to There Will Be a Light, Ben Harper and the Blind Boys of Alabama's CD for two years straight, and I never tire of it. To actually see them performing the songs is a special treat. Plus, you get bonus songs that were not on the CD. Ben is a rare musical genius. Okay? And The Blind Boys of Alabama are an institution in the world of gospel music. If this DVD doesn't touch you, make you want to get out of your seat and dance and shout, then make a doctor's appointment because something's wrong with you! :o)Five Stars all the way!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this album because the Blind Boys of Alabama were featured. As a long time lover of black gospel music I'm very familiar with their work. Unfortunately, I couldn't say the same about Ben Harper. I'd never heard of him, but I figured the Blind Boys at the Apollo Theatre were a sure bet. Wrong! In my opinion Ben Harper sings his message songs with way too much intellect and very little soul. He's just plain boring. The Blind Boys, used as back up to his vanilla music, never catch fire. They are there for the job and their talent is completely wasted. Sorry Ben Harper fans, it's just my opinion. I'm sure his heart is in the right place, too bad his music is weak. Gospel fans, save your money for more satisfying fare."
3,First crushes,"This is a really cute story. Beverly is upfront about everything she's feeling, and half the time you just want to say, I know exactly how she feels! It's a very funny story and great for girls who are just beginning to hit that age where boys are more than just gross."
4,Great literature,"This is a fabulous book. The writing is not focused on action and plot, but on character and setting. Doig creates a vivid Montana scene while leading his main character, Jick, through a book paced exactly as his summer. If you are looking for good literature, read this book."
3,How much time do you have?,"This book is going to be of little use to someone who is going to Scotland for a week to 10 days for their first visit. It seems that the original audience for this book is the AA, Automobile Assn (in the US, AAA) members looking for vacations or day trips. Although the book gives 25 great routes to take for scenery, it does not spend very much space telling you about what it is you are seeing when you get there, assuming you already know the history of the castle and so forth.This book could be very helpful if you were going to be in country for a couple of weeks or months, then coupled with more informative, detail oriented guides, this could lead you to some wonderful vistas. Depends on how much time you have, and what you have seen already in Scotland. If you have been there before, a leisurely driving trip could be just the thing."
3,Has some great music,"I saw ""The Color Purple"" on a recommendation of a friend and I was presently surprised with the show. The show has some great music (I am here, The Color Purple, Our Prayer, What About Love) but it lacks something. The show feels slow at times and has a tough time picking up steam. The cast is wonderful and extrememy talented but I don't think that the CD really captures the experience of the show in the theater.The CD is a worthy buy if you have seen the show. If you haven't seen the show then I think the listener will be missing out (""Any little thing"" sung by Sophia and Harpo is a great, funny song when performed on stage but not so much on record)"
2,Truly the 'idiot' guide,"I know this review won't make me friends with all the reviewers that rated this so highly... but... this book covers only the utmost basic of the basics. I quite honestly believe that if you don't already just know most of the stuff in this book, then maybe you should second-guess this whole marriage idea. I'm not trying to sound stuck-up or snobby... and I fully admit that when my fiance and I first started planning our wedding, there was a lot I didn't know... but it wasn't stuff you'll find in this book. I already know how to get along with my fiance (something covered in the book), how to handle wedding-arguements (covered in the book...) and that it's *her* big day... I mean, come on - if you don't know that stuff, well..."
4,"Good on implementating, Introduction on system","It is a good book for the neophyte or someone who is considering implementing or in the beginning stages of an implementation. Actually, it is a terrific choice if you fall in this group.If you are looking for an in depth analysis of the system, or a user manual, then forget about it, it is excessively simple in these aspects."
5,Beautiful!,"This is such a beautiful, respectable book! The portraits & stories of AA are profound & present fantastic role models for today's young AA girls. A hearty ""thank you"" to those responsible for compiling & publishing this book!"
4,"Excellent book, easy to follow.","This is a great book and will work for guitarists of any level. The content is well presented and easy to follow. If you want to learn EC unplugged tunes accurately, this is the quickest way."
5,2012 update,"The 1992 copyright of the Hal Leonard published book is valuable for the ""hungry to learn"" guitarist and should not be discounted. True, some of the tabs are not correct as EC and Andy played the cords. I write that statement because when one see's the video (EC Uplugged) in slow motion you can see EC playing slightly different cords. In addition, if one is looking at different website's for guitar tab in reference to the songs on the EC Unplugged you will see a spectrum of transcriptions to the songs. But understand there is of course a broad spectrum of talent. That said it may be well worth the dollars and purchase the book. BUT YOU DECIDE."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY,I have had other OPI products so I think this one has been tampered with since the color will not even last one day before wearing off. I use top coat and professional manicure using this product does the same. My granddaughter has same color from another source and never has this problem.
2,Weak,"I guess that technically this is made of some kind of leather. It feels much more like rubber or some synthetic substance. Totally adequate for holding up a guitar, but for the price, not a good buy. You get what you pay for. Nothing deluxe about it, el-cheopo is a more accurate description. By the way, I never try to give bad reviews, but look for a better strap. The distressed leather ones by planet waves are really nice, just a bit on the short side."
2,stiff guitar belt,belt is stiff such that the two edges of the belt can scratch if one was to run his hand or have the belt move against ones neck.
1,Do the Band a Favor; Don't Buy This.,"It's a shame that a band as talented as Reel Big Fish is being exploited like this. If you didn't know, Jive Records recently dropped the band (after several years of them begging to be let go), but is now releasing this collection to make a last bit of profit. As such, you really shouldn't buy this album. But fear not! If you're looking to get a good new collection of RBF hits, check out their new live album, aptly entitled ""Our Live Album is Better Than Your Live Album."" It's much better anyway. Reel Big Fish is one of the most talented bands around today and their live show is amazing, so there's really no reason to buy this album instead of the live one."
2,Not that good!,"I was expecting great things from this book since Peter Craig himself came from a Hollywood family. I have to say that the first 100 pages were strong, but then it just seemed to drag on. The book built up so much on the meeting of the father and son that the ending was a true disappointment."
2,The spokesman for the Church,"This book is merely a hundred something pages long and yet 99% of what the two authors said are in defense of the traditional church doctrine. The only credit they gave Dan Brown is the fact that he stirs up the debates reguarding Mary Magdelene. That's it. The rest are just praises of how the church's version of the history makes better sense, has more morality and is more ethically-oriented. They completely dismissed any Gnostic ideas. You don't need to waste a few dollars on this book when you can attend the church for free and have the pastor tell you the same things."
4,good service,"I have not listened to this book, yet. But the service was good. would buy from this seller again"
3,"READ HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL TO GET THE REAL TRUTH","This book is interesting and offers some intriguing viewpoints, but if you really want the truth about the factual basis for DA VINCI CODE, read HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL. That is all that need be said."
1,boring,"this book offers no answers. its just more of the same ol orthodox defense crap,, more then once they use the defense of not having enough pages to get their point across,,,,,, excuses don't get much worse,,,,,, like the dog that ate the home work. im not saying i accept the da vinci's code as fact ,, but at least its an interesting read,,,,,, these guys offer nothing"
1,Laughable,"Oh boy, this book is so insulting. Each chapter begins with an illustration, as the sermon-givers like to call them. A story about a young woman seeking truth and under siege from bad New Agers and Feminists. It's embarrassing, and, as I said, insulting to any adult reader. Try Welborn's De-Coding Da Vinci for a treatment of the issue that's objective and respectful of readers, no matter what their beliefs."
3,European History?,"Although much of the book provides a good background for much of Western history though the goggles of Human Rights, it at time seems to skip and distort aspects of it. How did benevolent religions sanction large scale war? Robespierre was not a champion of human rights by killing 20,000 people. Why are human rights still so in danger today? Don't get me wrong though, if you are looking for a historical read and do not have a lot of knowledge about European History, pick this up."
1,Reads like a well researched book report,"Ishay's introduction outlines an ambitious book, tracing human rights' origins and evolution over an immense historical period. However, what the introduction promises the body fails to deliver. Ishay spends most of her time simply recounting European history, and even that is done in such a maddeningly tangential way as to render it essentially useless. The book is a collection of facts, utterly lacking a cohesive argument or understanding. And some attempts are simply laughable - her attempt to explain the hegemony of the Western conception of rights is bland paraphrasing of Jared Diamond and leaves a question that could occupy the entire volume to be answered in mere pages. Please save your time and buy something else!"
1,Ultimate waste of time!,Ambiguous content with statements such as light can be very useful... AND! This book is of no value to any one who is remotely interested in greating/building actual game worlds. You would be better off giving the book a miss and check the forums out on the internet. I am gutted that I made the mistake of reading and believing the comments made on the books contents which now seems obvious these were placed by the authors friends and relatives. It's a pity Amazon do not accept returns! As such the book is destined for the bin.
5,Nice little practice amp,This amp has great volume for how tiny it is and a great decorative vintage look. The sound borders on a more reverb based sound if you turn the volume up too high but I find you can get a nice cleaner sound if you keep the volume moderate and go low on the gain. Great little practice amp!
5,GREAT!,"Sounds excellent, and is much louder than i had originally expected. works beyond my expectations and i am 100% satisfied with it. It has an excellent sound quality also."
1,No Band Profit!,Support the RBF. RBF doesn't get money for this. AVOID!! Damn the man. Save the Empire!
1,Just say NO to this album,"This album is utter trash. It is poorly mixed and is simply a rehash of all RBF's old songs. If you're really an RBF fan, you'll either have all their previously released albums already or you'll buy ""Our Live Album is Better Than Your Live Album"" which was released by the band after ditching their Jive label. This record is a last ditch effort on part of Jive to make one last bit of profit off one of the world's greatest ska bands. Don't feed the suits! Feed Reel Big Fish and buy ""Our Live Album is Better Than Your Live Album"" instead."
5,Lewis12172001,You know I'm like every other shopper out there I reviewed every strut known to man until I turned BLUE in the face to see which struts would be the best for my Tundra. So finally I settled for the Gabriel Ultra's and so far I am pleased with ride and response of my truck. I put the Gabriel Ultra's in my wifes SUV ( Ford Explorer ) to and we love the way our Ford ride and drives so yes I would recommend these struts for a Toyota Tundra and a Ford Explorer. Hope this helps....;-)
3,good struts but...,"I replaced the stock struts on my '05 Sequoia with these since I didn't have a spring compressor I had a shop do it and the alignment at the same time The shop said the spring didn't fully seat on the ring attached to the shock body on one strut, so the spring squeaks a little sometimes The overall value was good and the ride improved greatly I have used Gabriel shocks on 2 other Toyota trucks and put over 80,000 miles on each of them and they still worked good"
5,FUNNY COMEDY,"THIS MOVIE IS THE ALL-TIME BEST ADAM SANDLER MOVIE. IT STARTS OUT AS A LAZY, WORKING ONE DAY A WEEK BUM WHO ONE DAY A FIVE YEAR OLD SHOWS UP ON HIS DOORSTEP. THE KID IS HIS ROOMATE'S WHO IS IN CHINA. NOW WHILE HE'S GONE HE TAKES CUSTODY UNTIL THE FATHER GETS BACK. SO HE HAS A LOT OF FUN WITH THE KID. HE GOES TO THE PARK, HAS GREAT TIMES, BRINGS HIM TO SCHOOL, TEACHES HIM HOW TO DO THE SLEEPER HOLD, PEE ON A BUILDING, ETC. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!"
1,disapointment,"I saw this movie thinking it would be as funny as adam sandlers other movies,plain and simple this was a flop. There was 1-2 parts that were funny but thats about it. Some people thought it was cute what did they think was cute the 5 year old boy [peeing] on the side of the restaurant. i did not think it was funny. i saw it at the theatre and half way thru the movie there was more and more empty seats..."
5,One of Adam Sandler's best movies.,"Big Daddy is a great movie, it is fun to watch how a kid would develop if he had almost no rules.This is the movie that made me watch most Adam Sandler's movies, some were very bad movies like Waterboy and Grown Ups, but some are really fun like 50 First Dates.If you like silly jokes and simple humor, this is a great movie.If you like plot-depth movies stay away from this."
4,funny,"its funny but like most comedies it gets boring. not worth spending $10 for, rent it a couple of times instead."
2,Good movie!,I rented this movie along time ago on VHS. I kind of liked it. I thought it was pretty good. It didn't have good acting but it was good. It was called kidnapping when he wanted to keep the kid because he was trying to find the natural parents for him. I also think the title should be changed because he wasn't a daddy he was just looking after him for awhile. Some of the scenes were funny but not that funny. The kid did a good job for his first acting career. Adam Sandler was allright. He's not usually good in his movies but he is funny. The only thing that made me laugh in this movie was when he got mad and when he and the kid were peeing on the building.
1,Misleading Title,"I was very disappointed in this book. It's primary focus is on treasures pertinent to the Morman religion. However this is not mentioned in the details presented about the book. In addition, data is presented as factual but no sources or documentation are given."
2,this is a little kids book,I bought this book because I was expecting to ID the brown recluse which has several variations. This book had one poorly drawn picture and 1 sentence about the Brown Recluse. I was disappointed to say the least. This is one of those little field guides for kids.This would be a good field guide for someone about 8 years old.
3,Slow Going,"I'm sure the vernacular is appropriate for the characters and setting of this book, but to me it felt like slogging through a Florida swamp. The premise/storyline just wasn't compelling enough to make me want to work that hard, and it was difficult to keep the characters straight. However, I had to admire the fact that the author took an actual historic event and built a fictional novel around it. That is hard, hard work!"
3,Good enough,This book is good enough but could have been better. Some of the pages are strange Like a diagram of the teeth where you are supposed to write when they got them... Teeth are a long process not very well described by dates. Small things like that. If you buy a baby book be sure to be able to look inside.
3,Good environmentally-friendly towels,"I just starting using these towels this weekend at my daughter's first birthday. I was pleasantly surprised. They are very absorbent and do not fall apart. Although, I do find myself using more than one at a time because they are not tough enough for me. I am used to using Brawny, so they are thinner than tree- paper towels, but overall OK. I just wish planet friendly products were not so expensive."
5,Best Sausage Ever,"Once you've had Esposito's sausage, it's hard to imagine eating any other kind. Yes, it's expensive. But wow, is it amazing. The Provolone (Cheese) and Parsley is delicious - the cheese melts in your mouth! Perfect for sausage and peppers too, believe it or not. I'm wishing I was eating some right now..."
4,Not bad,"This is a perfect back-up drill for the price. It is called a ""Hammer"" drill but it doesn't actually hammer, it has a setting that actually ""grinds"" the chuck and that is supposed to simulate hammering... I think. I have used the drill and is is powerfull enough to do stuff around the house. If you are having second thoughts about buying this drill, just buy it, you wont regret it."
3,A bit dated,"I bought this to inspire my darling wife, who has her own business and doesn't realise how great she is. I was slightly disappointed to discover just how old it is, and so the stories are somewhat less relevant today. But she did enjoy most of it and it wasn't expensive. I'd love to find an updated version."
1,What Happened to This Guy?,"""Jazz in Film"" and its adjacent releases are some of my favorite CDs. But the last two Blanchard efforts have been extreme disappointments. I was hard pressed to find a tune underlying most of the tracks on this one. It's like ""Bitches Brew"" out of context and over the abyss. If I want to hear sounds like this I'll hang out in a lumber mill. I used to love this trumpet player. I did not even put this CD on the shelf in my collection."
5,Absolutely Excellent,"Superb and accurate sound reproduction. People who are familiar with hifi equipment appreciate the sound produced by these superb little speakers.To be fair, this system should be only compared to speakers that cost over $400.Produced by Cambride Sound Works, an excellent little company that got eaten (unfortunately) by Creative labs."
4,sound advice,"I am an audiophile and was looking for improvement(not perfection)using Microsoft media player for jazz and classical music,not games.I am not disappointed. The midrange limitations are adequatly handledwith the equalizer. Highs are fine. If you ramp-up the woofer it isdefinitely muddy but at normal levels it is fine."
2,Subwoofer busted way before Harmon Kardon,"The Harmon Kardon 2.1 still standing in the other room came with pc the year of 2001, the I-Trigue 3300 was bought at store in 2003 and gave out on the subwoofer - considering I wear headphones most of the time, durability with this product is doubtful.Same thing happened with Creative mp3 player - no lasting enjoyment. Bad customer support. Not worth it."
3,Not good enough,"Although very easy to read and understand, the book is very basic in every aspect. It has some nice pictures, and the fish description section is very good.This book doesn't talk about calcium aditions to the home reef, which is an escencial aspect of reef keeping.Also it gives little information on lighting, and the different kinds of lights. Lighting is also escencial and it surprises me how the book doesn't have much information about it.Also it talks about some types of filters that can be use, which are really not important or good for the reef aquarium.I would suggest more complete readings by J.Sprung"
5,Almost Perfect,"This book is one of the best books I found. If your not sure which book to buy, check the library for your title and go through it there. Step by step with check lists and tips. Explainations on just about everything. One problem I had to figure out myself was the plenum system. The author goes over it briefly but found no extra benifit. More research has led me to believe that the plenum could be used as an undergravel filter for serveral months. Upon setup and first water tests you could start to stock your tank without the worries of the tank going through cycles.Best book on Marine tank set up I've found...hands down."
3,nice pictures but old,this was a nice read some interesting photos but outdated. wonder if there are any new published books on saltwater tanks.
5,Fantastic strings,"These strings sound very very nice, I really love them. Bright, crisp, clean and a nice low-end. I bought them to go onto my Squier VM Fretless Jazz Bass and they do ""sing"" very nicely. Highly recommended, I'll probably be getting another set soon!"
2,Useless after six months,"I'll concentrate on the reasons why the Jabra has been useless to me after just a few months, but first I'll mention that I really liked the headset when it was still working ok - small, stylish, good quality. It has a few design flaws though, especially the stylish stand - it is difficult to hook it up, you have to fumble; and the tiny buttons (pairing button is only for people with fingernails).The major weakness is the little ear piece. When you switch the side from time to time, you have to pull it off and it becomes unusable after a while because the claw like attachment widens - then it simply falls off and won't stay in place anymore.To make matters worse, mine also doesn't pair anymore, no matter what device I try. It has become useless."
2,Not worth the money,"It is comfortable to wear, but it is very fragile. the ear clip started falling off the third week."
2,Huge Disappointment,This did not work well for me at all. Unless I was in a completely silent location background noise was so loud that everyone I spoke with complained. I quickly stopped using it and should have returned it.
3,"Beautiful form, mediocre function","This is, in my opinion the best looking headset on the market today. It looks better in person than I had expected -- although almost toyish in regard to size and weight (it's SO small)! It's the perfect esthetic compliment to the RAZR.That said, it suffers from average to perhaps slightly below average quality in regard to sound from the perspective of the person hearing your call. There is a muffled, distant quality at all times regardless of a full battery charge or of the proximity to the phone.Also, the chrome tip at the end of the ear loop broke off less than 2 days from the time I started using the headset. This was the result of having to mess with the bendable wire loop for a while in order to get the right fit for my big head.I'll be returning this headset for a less attractive but more usable device -- maybe the Sony Ericsson HBH-610(?). I'm hoping that a headet with the 2.0 Bluetooth spec. will perform better. OTOH, I don't know if the RAZR supports 2.0."
2,"Looks great, horrible in noisy surroundings","I have owned other Jabra headsets and when I bought my RazorV3 I decided to pay the higher price for the JX-10. No doubt the best looking headset around but my experience trying to be understood while in a brand new top of the line mini-van was very disappointing. Jabra replaced it once, but with the same results. The new earloop is much better though. I tossed the expensive looker in my drawer and went back to my old BT-250, which just ran out of battery life. Will probably not look at Jabra since the old BT style is too clunky."
3,"Loved it when it worked, but...","I was able to get this to work out of the box with my Blackberry 8703e from Sprint, but soon I had the dreaded dropped calls or no audio. Since then it has not worked at all with the 8703e and I've had to return it. The sound when it did work was incredible compared to the Motorola HS850 and the Jabra BT250. No echo on the other end for the caller, no static, great sound. The issue is evidently with the phone and not the headset, but I have to put in my 2 cents for those looking at this for the 8703e."
5,Good quality,My husband plays guitar and I play dulcimer. These picks work well. I passed some out to dulcimer friends at a jamand everyone liked them. I got few back. Guess they liked them too much!
4,Good picks but take note,"I have no qualms about the picks themselves. However, they don't come in a multi-color/style as the picture leads you to believe. Guess I should have read the description more carefully. Oh well."
2,Medicore results,"Suction lasts about a day before it gives out. Usual problem getting the device out of the plastic bubble it was wrapped in. Low price, but not worth it."
1,fit of Bath Safety Grip Handle,Bath Safety Grip Handledoes not fit. I assumed incorrectly that there are standard sizes to bath tub rims. The suction cup edges are larger than my tub rim so that it is impossible to get suction with them. This was a frustrating experience. It is the only and last time that I order from a TV ad.
1,Not safe!,"My husband and I bought this product for a friend of ours who recently had his leg amputated due to complications from a disease that my husband also has.My husband wanted to try this out before giving it to our friend, and it is a good thing he did! I want to agree with a past reviewer who said something along the lines of this being ""horrifying"". I am very glad I did not give this to my friend, my husband (who is 39) attached it to many different surfaces and each time it came undone. I am appalled that this product is being sold as a safety grip. It is one thing to make a product like the ""ped-egg""and rip people off by telling them their feet will be smooth, no harm, no foul! but this is a dangerous product and I cringe to imagine people buying this for elderly relatives and thinking they will be fine to bathe unassisted. This product is, frankly, offensive in it's false advertising and very dangerous!"
2,Detaches by itself,"I was surprised by this suction grab bar. I placed it on the side of a ceramic bathtub the next morning it was on the floor. No one touched it or used it. I have other suction grab bars, different brand and they are still attached."
2,Too simple - seems just copied from different books,"Her first book ""Lion don't need to roar"" is a very fine book. However, all her other books (CEO, 100K, etc) are just pure fluff. It is very apparent that she just gathered information from here and there and paste them together as her work. Obviously, she has run out of new things to write about. Instead of havign some real stuff to talk about as in her first book, it seems like she is really now writing only for the money. Very superficial. Don't waste your money."
1,IT'S A TRAP --SAVE YOUR MONEY-- READ THINK AND GROW RICH,"THIS BOOK IS FULL OF FLUFF. EXTREMELY VAGUE. NO SUBSTANCE; NO HARD FACTS AND NO SURE FIRE WAY TO SECURE THE $100,000 JOB. THE ONLY PERSON ACHIEVING $100,000 WITH THIS BOOK IS MS. DEBRA A. BENTON."
5,Sheer Pleasure,"I don't know how necessary the little puffy shirt doodad is...you could opt to just buy these two seasons separately for fewer bucks...but the viewing contained therein equals non-stop hilarity.Everybody on the planet by now knows what Seinfeld is and has seen all the eps in syndication, but still, I marvel at the pleasure these sets give. No matter how many times you've watched 'em they still hold up and they're still funny. The features too - the commentaries, the Notes About Nothing, etc. -are all well worth indulging in, too...All in all, a must have set."
2,Student,"Prof. Simovici is an excellent professor, and his examples were extremely helpful for the course. But he's no author... I cracked this book open 3 times in the semester, and it was only to look at page 32. If you buy the book you'll know what I mean."
3,"Works good, but buy a lot...","I have ordered and used these for a few years. Here are my thoughts.Pros:-They work better than any other system I have tried.Cons:-Most recently, we ordered 4. Two of them worked.-The lever that you use to release the lid generally breaks after a few months.-The cost for these is fairly low, but shipping offsets it. My advice, unfortunately, is to buy a bunch to save on shipping.As I mentioned previously, we bought 4 last Christmas. Two of them worked. By May, both of them had broken. Might be cheaper just to finish the soda all at once."
1,Didn't work,"This product didn't work for me, I tried it on several different cans. While it did sometimes provide a seal, the soda in the can would still go flat. Useless to me, I've done all but throw them away."
1,Not Very Rewarding,"In a word, disappointing. We purchased this game thinking it was representative of Disney interactive products. At first, our five year old son enjoyed playing it but quickly bored of it. Kids have to repeat the phonics exercises over and over and over again - sometimes more than 10 times - to receive any kind of fan-fare or reward in retrieving the Sorcerer's lost items. Excellent graphics and great activities but there certainly should be more verbal or graphic reward as incentives to make the child want to further pursue the game. Kids of this age react much better to more frequent reward...and this game just disappoints for computer active, advanced children. Other Disney products have been better received."
3,Could be better...,"It doesn't leak, which is good, but the sports cap doesn't work all that well. You end up gulping as much air as water when you use it. You could always unscrew the cap and use it as a regular bottle, but that kinda defeats the purpose of the sports cap."
3,Good except for sports cap,"No complaints, except sports cap hardly releases any water, and sucking on nozzle becomes annoying after a while."
4,Best product in it's category,I love my klean kanteen and knowing I'm not exposing myself to leaching plastic anymore - this is the only one out there that I'm aware of that is all Stainless which in my opinion is about the safest material besides glass you can drink from. I'm not a huge fan of the sports cap - it leaks quite a bit and the cap doesn't like to stay put.
1,DO NOT BUY,"OK this system is great i will admit.. when it works. I bought mine from creative labs 19 months ago. The sub stopped coming on. It just wont power up. i have seen that a lot of people have had this problem. I called and talked to customer support about it.. it turns out they dont care. I was told that they cannot sell me a replacement piece, not only that but they refuse to repair it (i offered to pay for the repair). A friend of mine came over to look at it, and when we opened it up we found that all the wires were glued together lol making it just about impossible to repair (which explains why creative labs doesnt repair their products)So after an hour on the phone with creative labs i learned that creative labs makes cheap products and if they break they dont care. I wont buy anything else from them and i would suggest everyone not either."
2,Totally unsatisfying,"After reading the cover flap I was hoping for something like Vinge's The Peace War, with alien invaders thrown into the mix. I wast very disappointed. I didn't end up caring about any of the characters, the aliens were totally incomprehensible and the ending was very weak. It wasn't even very good at being bleak. This was not really a bad book, but not one that engaged me, and one that fell far short of my expectations."
1,"an ""epic"" waste of my time","Silverberg boldly claims this as ""his epic masterpiece"". This is as epic as an episode of Baywatch. The only good part of this book was the first 15 pages. After that you might as well just write whatever you think of...it would most likely be more interesting than the rest of this crummy book. If you are beginning to read it, lemme 'spoil' it for you: the earthlings do not retake the planet, the god-like aliens just leave. THATS IT. No standard all-out battle, no cunning ploy, not even an explanation. I was left feeling so cheated that I fed this book to my rabbits. I didn't even try to get my money back. Well, I could go on but even a review of this 'epic' goosegg is not worth the space to print, much like the book. Avoid this book. Save the shame at being caught, in the end, with absolutely nothing."
1,LOTS OF SILENCE,"Both people on this CD have soothing voices, but they repeat and repeat the same words. I do not like Cd's with bells or chimes, because it does not allow you to relax. This is a silly CD!!!"
4,nice,i like the game graphics not that great but i love rpg and role playing games so this made me happy plus amazon prime sent it fast :D
4,The blue dragon,"I bought this for my 12 yr old daughter. the first couple of hours she said it was a hard game, 3 days later she had defeated the whole game. She said it was a lot of fun though and she really liked it."
5,Good rpg,"From the creator of final fantasy, he has gone on and made his new company Mistwalker, great rpg, for rpg fans only though"
3,hard thinking!,"It would had been better if a poster would have come with the puzzle,specially with this one that have alot of characters."
5,Reality Is Turned On Its Head,"There are multiple realities, or are there? What is reality? What is real? What is truth? If you believe something to be true, then is it true?This is a mind bending book that plays with these questions and others. I really don't want to give too much away. The setting is an alternate future where Germany and Japan won WW2. But this is only the groundwork for a much larger scope.This world is a very anxious world, and all of the characters seem to exist in a perpetual state of panic and anxiety. As if their world is upside down or spinning out of control in the wrong direction. Some scenes are truly horrific. One gets a sense that there are no clear choices to be made, because the world makes no sense.Truly unforgettable conclusion; you will just have to read it to find out for yourself. This book is wild."
3,Average read,"Easy read and moderately entertaining. While not boring, this is not an action-oriented book, so if you want a lot of action, this title might not suit you.Due to the way this book was written, it ages fairly well, because it does not rely on typical sci-fi themes of technological advancements. Having said that, what German technological space travel advancements are predicted (opposed to what the Americans had accomplished by 1962), turn out to be non-sequiters; I.e., human exploration of Venus and Mars - the former is impossible in reality, and the second is extremely far-fetched (hell, the USA didn't even get to the Moon until 1969)."
2,Unsatisfied.,"I was really excited to read this book when I bought it, but was pretty disappointed by the end. First, it is not science fiction. Second, although the characters are well drawn, the story is just not that interesting. Finally, and the most important drawback, the ending really sucks. There is no resolution, so you feel like why did I go to the trouble to read this if it doesn't go anywhere. Overall, I finished the last page feeling very unsatisfied."
1,Hugo award-winner? Why?,"An altogether confusing and frustrating read. I picked this up because of all the hype surrounding it. It ended up being the most rambling, incoherent thing I'd read sinceOn the Road.When I finished it, I was left with the impression that either Philip K. Dick is not my cup of tea, or that all those who praise this book are just looking for validation from others who praise this book, but ultimately none of them know what they are talking about.At any rate, it would take a really strong recommendation from someone whose reading tastes I trust to get me to read anything else by Dick."
4,Excellent Novel,"This is a superbly written exploration of what the world might have been like had Germany and Japan won the war. It's about how people survive when the ruling culture is not their own; how hope can be found between the covers of a book - how that same book can hold terror or fear for someone from a different persepective.What made me love this book, really love it, is not so much the idea of this alternate history of the United States, but how real the characters were for me. Frank Frink, his ex-wife, Juliana, Robert Childen, everybody. They were people, or personalities if you like, that you could see being created by this situation.I'd give this book to anyone to read and tell them to sit back and let it make them think. Run in the world Dick's created; imagine what it would be like. What would you be doing in this world? What would your family be doing? How would you survive in this world? It's a worthy book to spend your time on."
3,"Thought-provoking, but...","Dick takes us on a journey through one of the most unthinkable ""what if"" scenarios: Germany has won World War II. Through tidbits along the way, we learn of some of the factors that contributed the the defeat of the United States. It's a well thought-out alternative history.Without spoiling anything, I'll tell you that there is a ""book within the book."" When you read about this, ask yourself exactly what Dick is satirizing--what is he getting at?Unfortunately I found the ending unsatisfying. However, the book is memorable, and a good reminder of a possible world that was prevented by the actions of the Allies in WWII."
4,"My introduction to the late, great PKD . . .","Dick's alternate history of a world where the Axis powers prevailed in World War II goes way beyond the macro level. He gets deep into his characters' lives. His characterizations of the young Japanese couple and the accomplished Mr. Tagomi have remained with me in the years since I originally read the book.PKD is one of those rare authors who makes you feel that he is scratching the surface of deeper truths. Although it's true that the ending fails to deliver, rumor has it that Dick wrote the whole book using the I-Ching and lived with the ending it gave him. Don't worry, it's still well worth your reading. My friends and I felt compelled to spend the next few weeks at work contemplating the ""Wu"" and ""Wabe"" of everyday objects and composing haikus."
3,"Goes off on too many ""rabbit trails""","The thesis of the story is the type of reading I usually enjoy. Historical fiction turning the history upside down. This one had great potential but just got bogged down. Goes off on tangents and then stays much too long on some tangents. When I read the last page all I could say is ""huh""."
3,Not bad,"I bought this book knowing it was a sci-fi classic, but not much else about it. It's definitely well written and the author really draws you in. It was just a little more cerebral than I had in mind. But if you like cerebral sci-fi, I highly recommend it. It'll make you think."
5,Lasher,I really enjoyed this book and could not put it down. They Mayfair series is great. I don't agree at all with the comments that this book is not as good as The Witching Hour. I would highly recommend this book.
5,I want more,I couldn't go to sleep till I had read all of it and still I read it more then I should of. I still fill as though I didn't get my fill of this book. I have to say that Anne Rice is now the one person in this world that can have my love of reading. Any one that loves Stephen King's books would love her books.
3,No where near as good as the Witching Hour,"Let me start by saying, that Anne Rice is a phenomenal writer,with a rich writing style that always puts you right on the page withthe characters. Having said that, let me say that Lasher was a disappointment, not because the writing style was not up to par, because it was. Rather...well, it felt like she had a contract to write a sequel and so she just made up something. I was disappointed in what Lasher turned out to be. It sort of took the spookiness out of the first one. I realize that not every book can be as good as The Witching Hour or The Vampire Lestat, but I'd like for it to feel as though the author thinks it is as good."
5,Slow to start but all Anne Rice,I became involved with Anne Rice in the Vampire Chronicles and have not read another author since. I had gotten away from reading books for a few years after starting Lasher. I have begun again and picked up Lasher from where I left off and have not missed a beat. It is as intriguing as the vampires were and I am looking forward to reading Taltos. She has made a firm believer out of me. >>>>Thanks Anne<<<<<<
2,"""Lasher"" is psychospook; Rice lacks another bewitching hour!","""Lasher"" could just as well have been the tired hand of Salmaan Rushdie. It becomes overtly theatrical and etherial in a noisy way. However, ""The Witching Hour"" was potent yet delicate and downright bewitching not-so-fiction! I frightfully await the former Rice who hovered with spine-tingling complacency and ease...besting even Edgar Allen Poe!"
3,I kept thinking Lasher was Howard Stern,I really liked this book. It was a bit draggy at times but I kept picturing this seven foot giant with long dark hair as Howard Stern. If Howard is looking for a character to play. I think he should get together with Anne Rice and have some body write a screen play. What could be a better part for Howard then running around the countryside raping a bunch of women. He said he's waiting for an interesting story. I think this is it. If any of Howards fans reads this review tell him to read the book . I also think the story would be better as a movie to get rid of most of the filler.
2,I don't like Lasher,"In the end I think it became that simple for me. I don't like Lasher. I don't like the female lead, and Michael wore out his welcome as well. For myself the downfall of the Mayfair Witch series isn't in the prose which is every bit as seductive as ever, it is that the characters became distasteful. While the Vampire Chronicle characters of Lestat, Louis, Claudia, etc have a way of both attracting and repelling the reader, in the end I found most of the characters in this series to be simply repellent. Rice still writes in a wonderful style, but these characters worse than left me cold-- they often disgusted me."
3,Lasher is no Lestat,"I know it is probably unfair to compare Lasher with Lestat. But it's difficult not to because Lestat is still far and away Ms. Rice's greatest character. When I read ""The Witching Hour"" I couldn't wait to find out more about Lasher. What makes him tick? Is he evil, or simply misunderstood like Lestat?Well, Lasher turns out to be a great big bore. And it's pathetic that all he wants to be is flesh. He's a powerful spirit, and all he wants to be is human so he can participate in some weird occult ritual? Uh, OK. I found myself wishing that he would encounter Lestat and that Lestat would either soundly kick his rear, or hang out with him so that some of Lestat's personality could rub off on him!Oh well, I still gave this three stars because this book moves along a little more than ""The Witching Hour."" I would say, read this book if you like ""The Witching Hour"" and if you are a huge Anne Rice fan. Otherwise, stick to the Lestat stories! He is much more interesting!"
5,Awesome!!!,"Fantastic!!!!! In my opinion, Anne Rice is the greatest author of all time!!! I have read everything she has written, and love every book..."
3,Lasher's a let-down,"After racing through The Witching Hour, I couldn't wait to read the sequel. The story of Lasher had great potential and started out well, but the ending was weak. Everything happened too fast. I finished the book feeling very empty; The Witching Hour was much more thought-provoking and occupied my mind for days afterward. If you enjoyed The Witching Hour, I don't recommend reading the sequel, it doesn't adequately finish the story. I can't believe there is a third book. What more is there to say?"
1,Absolutely dreadful! Rice at her ...worst!,"This book should never had been written. The plot is so dreadful that my temporary suspension of disbelief positively snapped! The series started high, Anne Rice at her best, but her creativity began to dry up and her characters became cartoon characters by this point. Finishing this book was an unbearable chore and was similar to a seven-course meal prepared by a bungling chef who cannot read a recipe."
2,Tedious,"I've read and enjoyed all of Ann Rice's vampire books, but the Mayfair books are so boooooring and tedious that I couldn't finish this one. It goes on and on and on with various personal histories, explanations of individual family members. Interspersed among the longwinded tedious trivia are a few moments of something happening, but even those are usually hard to comprehend. Toward the end Lasher forces us to listen to his long-winded explanation of his life. How he came to be in control of the Mayfair home is a mystery that happens in some incomprehensible half page. By then I was so bored that I put it down and haven't gotten back to it. Read it if you're a really dedicated Rice fan willing to endure endless punishment."
1,horse manure,"i didnt even listen to this and im not going too. you konw why, its because no bogus 80s rock band should have the right to cover such amazing songs that shouldnt even be touched. how dare anyone say these bozos play the songs better than the original, get your heads out of your asses, if you want some real zep get the live dvd, it will blow your mind"
3,Braun Shaver,"A new cutter and screen makes this razor like new, but the part numbering is very misleading!!Parts for '3600 series' razors DO NOT FIT 3612 razors!!True, a new cutter and screen makes it operate like new, but the wrong parts don't fit and cost more to return than it's worth. The associated illustration here is the wrong part for the 3612"
5,Meaningful songwriting and excellent singing,"The CD by the artist Gary Oliver entitled Gary Oliver is a wonderful mixture of music styles. The recording is inspirational and highly uplifting. The songs Resting Place and Trust Me are songs that focus your mind on the peace and love God has for us. Another song Spirit of the Lord Divine is a song of worship and adoration for the Lord. I found this CD to be one of the best Christian/Gospel recordings I've heard recently. Listening to this CD has truly been a blessing and a Joy. I hope to hear more music from Gary Oliver in the future. If you like good singing with a wide range of emotion and sincerity, this CD will become one of your musical treasures"
4,"Maybe not ""excellent"" but very good","""Essential 55"" is a hard act to follow but Clark has written a book that every teacher should read before school starts, just to get the mind more focused on these important characteristics. However, he must have used up his best stories in his first book because this one just doesn't have the can't-put-it-down and must-share-with-colleagues quality that his first did. But it's good none-the-less."
3,Interesting,"Kafka's ""Amerika"" was the first of his novels that I read following a survey of his short stories. It's a witty and charming book, even if the America Kafka presents is completely unlike any America I've ever heard of. Still, I didn't find it that engaging. I felt as if Karl, the main character, was something of a pinball, bouncing from one place and situation to another as a consequence of the seeminly random decisions of those around him. He spends an awful lot of time thinking and thinking and thinking, but in the end all his thoughts don't amount to much and he's kicked to the next event.Also, please remember this is an unfinished novel! Unlike many of Kafka's unfinished stories, it doesn't cut off at any particular final point, it just sort of stops, and now I'm frustrated! ;-)"
2,"like dickens, only by kafka","This first novel is incomplete and was never intended for publication. It isn't funny, it isn't fun, and it certainly isn't very original. Kafka wrote it as an exercise and that is all it should be. Upon reading it carefully, I can only conclude that perhaps it should not have been published as it simply doesn't stand up to this master's best work. As such it is really only of interest to scholars.Basically, it follows the journey through America of a clueless twit into a variety of catastrophic misadventures, from getting a maid pregnant without even understanding he was committing a sexual act to losing job after job in New York and environs. While it does have some of the bizarre atmospherics that Kafka later perfected, the themes in it are not of the timeless horror and angst that later marked Kafka as a peculiar genius.Skip it and go on to The Trial or The Castle. If you don't know Kafka, start with Metamorphosis."
3,Spend your time with Kafka elsewhere...,"Look. If you're reading this review, you're more than likely to have read a bit of some good lit. You're here because you're searching for more. If you're here because you heard Kafka is amazing, great. If you haven't read Kafka, don't start here. Read the Trial and the Castle. If you have read all the essential Kafka, read something else. Pick up Blood Meridian or even read Dante, or please read Notes from the Underground. There's a lot better stuff out there than Amerika.-JRW"
3,Disappointed in you Faith,"I expected this album to be WAAAY better than it is. The beats and the tempos are mismatched with her voice. If you listen closely to the songs, the beats just don't sound right where she hits her high notes. The only songs I really like off of here are ""Goin' Out,"" ""Hope"" and ""Catchin' Feelings."" I am a Faith fan, but this is one I could have skipped buying for real."
4,Very superb album from Faith!,"Faith Evans' album, The First Lady is superb! I have been playing several of the songs over and over. This is just as good as her first and third albums. She has some funky numbers such as Goin' Out, Mesmerized,Hope, her duet with Mario Winans and others. But she is just fabulous on the ballads. I love Stop N Go and I hope that it becomes a future single. Some of the best numbers are with Haggins and Barias, known for their songs with Musiq. But I love the ones with Jermaine Dupri, the Neptunes and some other people. And to correct the main review, her new album is on Capitol Records, not Columbia. Faith has some competition next week with Mariah Carey's upcoming new album,so we have some strong female singers' albums out at this moment!"
3,The First Lady Finishes In Last Place,"This is possibly Faith's worst album to date. She has her typical -MaryJ.Blige-esque- songs but minus the soufulness of her predecessor (""Mesmerize"" & ""Jealous"") and there is even an -AMERIEwouldhavekilledit- song (""Going Out""). This Album is probably not worth buying unless your a true Faith fan. The production isnt as good as any of her prior releases on BadBoy; and she falls far from the balance of her debut cd. IF YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST have some NEW FAITH on your iPod then...""Stop N Go"" (think MONICA's ""Breaks My Heart"" slowed down and with a smoother rhythm but same cadence) & ""Catching Feelings"" make for good DOWNLOADS and ""Get Over You"" & ""Until You Come Back"" are on the next tier. But this album is crap...don't be surprised if, even with all this sudden, last minute press to push the cd, she gets lost in the Tweet, Mariah fold in which she is sure to be enveloped."
3,"It's good, but-","This CD is good, but it lacks originality. There are really good songs, like ""Goin' Out"", ""Stop N Go"", ""Tru Love"", & ""Ever Wonder"". But, some tracks are seriously not good, like ""Mesmerized"" and ""Lucky Day"". Though repititous and not as I though it would be, ""The First Lady"" stands out."
2,This album was such a disappointment.,"When I heard that Faith Evans was coming out with a new CD, I couldn't wait. I was expecting so much because her last album Faithfully was her best, and the lead-off single, ""Again"", was her best single yet. But my expectations were left unfulfilled.The only decent songs on here are ""Again"" and ""Mesmerized."" That is it. The rest of this album is uninspired, lackluster material like ""Tru Love"", ""Get Over You"" and ""Lucky Day."" But nothing can compare to the shameful, redundant, throwout track from the Neptunes, ""Goin' Out.""This CD has lame lyrics, mediocre production, okay vocals and poor writing. The two standout tracks are the only thing that save this mess."
1,First Lady of What?,"I don't get it, with the title of First Lady you'd think she'd come out with some good ass music. We need to snatch that title away from her and give it to Ashanti because I believe she's the one who ushered in the new sound of RnB that other ladies are trying to imitate but fail.Their was none on this album except for 3 songs that were just decent. The music was just horrible. People are saying this is a classic album? No sir it is not. If you wanna hear a classic album, THATS ACTUALLY GOOD, go listen to Amerie- Touch. Thats a REAL R&B; album right there."
2,Not Faith's Best Talent,"I could not wait for her new album to be released-and boy am I disappointed. Faith Evans is an excellent vocalist and songwriter,so I can't believe the work she just put out...put or thrown together is what I should say. I guess being on hiatus for a couple of years would throw you off as far as 5 star-worthy material is concerned. ""Hope"" is the best title track on the album and I don't care that much for the song!"
1,Poor Faith,"Just horrible!When I first heard ""Again"" I got excited because I thought Faith was about to bring it. I thought everyone was about to really see who Faith Evans is. Was I wrong. This is cd lacks SUBSTANCE! She sings about STRAIGHT BS.... Faith Evans can sing true enough, but it takes more than great vocals to be successful in the music business. Faith hasn't had a very successful career because she makes BS songs like ""love like this before"" ""Burning Up"" ""All Night Long"" WTF are you talking about. Everybody talking about how great of a writer she is, I beg to differ. There are no really deep lyrical songs on this CD. Faith isn't a pop artist so she should leave the pop songs alone (going out). This CD is just horrible.Im sorry Faith, Until you come with some real timeless music, you will no longer trick me into buying another CD. I should have learned my lesson with the last one."
1,0 support,"The Linksys router did not have an account number or pin number in the box for the Net2phone service. Both Linksys and Net2phone blew me off after hours of phone holding, computer answered e-mails, and phone conversations. Both companies do not care to support this product, so save yourself some grief and time and stay away from it."
4,Very amusing and classically Shakespeare...,"I found this little drama highly amusing. While definitely Shakespearian in plot and language, it still had entertainment value. The story itself is all about how Petruchio determines to woo and win the most ""shrewish""(sharped-tongued)lass in the village, Katherina, with, of course, the added advantage of her substantial dowry in mind. He then attempts by many obnoxious strategies and antics to manipulate her into the model of sweet docility. Meanwhile the rest of the manly populace of Padua is courting Katherina's sister, the mild Bianca. But eventually, after schemings, impersonations, and elopements, everthing is resolved in marriage, and Petruchio happily proves to all that his bride is indeed the most conpliant of wives."
4,Great resource for students or teachers.,"The whole Cambridge series is very valuable. It offers helpful footnotes without cluttering the page, and actually indicates within the text when a footnote will appear. Text appears on right-hand side, and left-hand page offers thoughtful questions and activities to spur engagement, including comprehension and analysis, get-out-of-your-seats and act, and staging/directorial decision-making, and thematic extensions."
1,Taming of the Shrew Review,"This is not the book I ordered--If it was a book for personal reading I would have no problem, but it was ordered for academic purposes.It did arrive in a timely manner though."
4,A classic radio production in the English tradition,"Were it not for the handful of classic BBC radio Shakespeare productions that Harper-Collins' Caedmon label has issued on tape, some of the best performances of the classic British stage actors would be lost . Trevor Howard balances bombast and charm in a fine performance as Petruchio, while Margaret Leighton (who is perhaps an unknown to most US audiences) brings fire and grace to the role of Katherina. A classy production all around. My only regret is that it is not available on CD."
3,Great story.,"Very funny story. Gotta hand it to Shakespear here, it is a nice comedy. Just slightly not my style.The notations on the words/phrases were invaluable for a shakespearian layman like myself. The names all slurred together after a while so I found myself reading out-loud and still getting a bit lost. Everyone impersonating everyone else...who are impersonating someone else...confusing.The book, although good, gets 3 stars because I had to rent the movie of the play to get it. Once I figured it out, however, the book made sense and was funny. This one may be a book to pass up, and watch the movie instead. Too many characters with names that all sound the same to make it an easy read."
5,10 Things I Hate About YOU!,"Go see 10 Things I Hate About You, the movie that is based on the book; it is wonderful!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Classic Moon Atlas!,"It's a shame that this classic atlas is again out of print. The ""Second Edition"" is even better than the first. Perhaps a ""Third Edition"" will be forthcoming? Whatever, the prices for this on the second hand market have, at times, gotten unreasonable. Rukl's maps are timeless with the pictures and detailed information more than you could hope for. If you can , try to get this or the first edition at a good price. If you're interested in the moon, you won't be sorry. A wonderful compliment book would be The Modern Moon- A Personal View by Charles A. Wood which is fortunately still in print."
5,Happy Tumblers,"I am enjoying my colorful tumblers! They add bright color to my kitchen, are durable and stackable - a must for me because I don't have a lot of storage space in my kitchen."
4,A Light Romance,"The Black Widow is a light romance with the underlying tension of a secret plot to obtain an inheritance through murder and madness. The heroine is likeable, the hero is idealised and the heroine's relatives truly awful. Lot's of fun."
2,Boring.,"I didn't like it. I hate self-pity stories. It was so boring that I never finished it. Yet another boring Newberry Award winner. Doesn't the commitee ever look at interesting, fun stories? Or do they sit around all day reading depressing books?"
1,How did...THIS...get a Newbery Award?,"When I had finished this book, I sat and puzzled something thathad plagued me from the first page. How did this...this undeservingbook manage to get the Newbery Award? The characters were flat and boring, the plot was short, boring, and stupid, and personally it made no sense. I know it's supposed to be a young adult book...but come on, you'd think that it's for eight-year-olds! If you want to read something just for the sake of reading something, go on read this book."
5,Missing May,"After the death of Summer's mother, Summer is passed from one foster home to another at the age of only six years old. This is when a miracle happens. Aunt May and Uncle Ob decide to take her back with them to West Virginia. When Summer thinks her life is finally getting better, Aunt May dies. Both Summer and Uncle Ob are having a hard time coping with the death of their loved one. When things seem like they can get no worse, Cletus Underwood from her seventh grade class gets involved. Cletus ends up helping Summer discover a number of things about herself. She learns to deal with death and help Uncle Ob recover in a way she did not expect.This is a great book to read. It helps both children and adults understand how to deal with losing a loved one. The author uses both humor and suspense to entice and captivate the reader."
4,Missing May,This was an awesome book! It is one of the best books I have ever read. I would recomend it to anyone ages 8-15!!!
3,Missing May,"I thought this book was just O.K. It is not a book I would read twice. I really enjoyed the character of Cletus. Poeple that are different from others are always fun to get to know. I think the only thing that actually let me down was the ending. I just kind of felt like I was left out of what happened, there was no pounch at the end."
2,Um...Uh...not what I expected.,"After reading this book I found myself strangely dissapointed. By reading the back of the book I figured I had an excellent read on my hands. Well, I didn't. I definately didn't. The characters were undeveloped, (like paper dolls, flat.) and as soon as I started getting to know the characters, the book was over. In other words, it was much too short. You'd think a book so sad and touching(well, I think that was what the author was aiming for)would be a lot longer so you could start to feel what the protagonist(s) are feeling. Read it if you must, but only if you must."
4,Missing May Review,I thought that this book did an excellent job of portraying the death of a loved one through the eyes of a child. Death is an obstacle that is not easy for children to deal with. I think the book did a great job of displaying to children that it is alright to be upset with a loss as long as you take your time to mourn and get on with your life.
1,Missing May,"Missing may is a story about a girl who lives with her aunt and uncle, before her aunt dies. It could have been a nearly ok book, but the characters spend too much time thinking and moping and nothing interesting really occers.If you like books that are mainly people feeling miserable about life, check it out- but I wouldnt suggest it to anyone."
3,The First Rambo?,"Written in 1974 and then re-released in a new 2002 edition, Mr. Majestykis an average crime, revenge, Western action novel. In 1981 First Blood, the original Rambo novel by David Morrell appeared, and the two books havesome similarities: The protagonist was in Viet Nam, learned to kill skillfully and silently in the jungle; upon return to a sparsely populatedarea, he wanted to live alone; when hasselled by the police, his steelynature appeared; both characters spend the rest of the novel seeking toavenge wrongful treatment. Maybe this is true of many novels during the post-war period, but the parallels were interesting.As for style, it's lean prose with fairly ordinary dialogue. Overall,not a word wasted."
2,Practical but has to be drilled in,"This is a practical piece to hang the ironing board and store cans of starch, however unless you screw it in to the door, I find that it will tilt to one side when you open the door it's hanging on."
5,Great Product,"This product works great. I have it hung on the door to my laundry room, which stays open at all times, and it does exactly what it is supposed to do. I love it."
5,Excellent,This is just what we wanted. It keeps everything iron related behind the door and easy to find.
4,Flaw-covering foundation,"The key to getting this foundation on smoothly is to first put on a moisturizer, then it'll glide over the skin nicely. You might need a washcloth with bar soap to remove, though, as it stays put."
1,breast soreness,"Ok...so everyone is looking for better looking skin. I bought the hylaruinc acid and collagen C for better skin, hair, gums, etc. But after 27 days, I did not change anything else in my health/exercise regime and my breasts became so sensitive that a bra became uncomforable. I wrote to Neocall about the sensation...and I got the autamated 24 hour guananteed response....but never got any real response! I had just had a mamogram and it was clear....but breasts so uncomfortable i'm looking for some answers from Neocal. It has been a week and still no response."
3,Concept Better Than Execution,"I kept thinking of the original Star Trek series while I was reading this 35-year old romance. Why? Because it's pretty campy, dated in numerous ways, not all that well done, but I enjoyed it anyway. Also, just like we wouldn't have had Star Trek: Next Generation (perhaps my favorite TV series of all time) without the original's success, we wouldn't have the wonderful romance books available that we do today without a bunch of these first. Yes, there's forced seduction, yes the hero spanks the heroine (something like three swats). If you have issues with either of those kind of events, skip this one. If not, I would still recommend Kathleen Woodiwiss's ""The Wolf and the Dove"" over this. More authentic (feels--I haven't actually done the research), better characterization, more believable conflicts, better writing all around. On the plus side, this IS a desert romance and the plot does move along fairly well."
3,It could be better,"I think this book is too similar to E.M. Hull's the sheik, but i still liked, although not as much as many others johanna lindsey's books"
4,The story was good.,"My friend recomend that I start reading Johanna Lindsey books and I saw this one and read it. I haven't read too much of her work, but I thought it was good, a few parts were a little stupid, but overall I enjoyed it."
4,Another captive read by Johanna Lindsay,I enjoyed this book. It was easy to get caught up in the story. It was definitely another captive read by Johanna Lindsay.
3,My Opinion,"This is not one of my favorites, but it's well worth reading. I never go into what the book is about, because so many others will tell you that. I recommend you read every one of her books, because even her worst is good. I can't think of more than 2, that have ever been a little disappointing. I buy all her books when they come out, even if I don't have the time to read them, right away."
3,Um...,"Okay, I must admit that the only reason I read this book was because of my own guilty pleasure. It was OK I guess. I really enjoyed the desert scenes betwee Philip abd Crissy. And dispied what anyone else says, I loved the part where he had to spank her. I don't think I'd mind getting spanked by him my self ;)I wouldn't want to read this book again. This wasn't too much of a page turner for my liking."
2,What the hell was this..........,"I have to say that I am a big fan of Johanna Lindsey.........especially the Malory books..........however this one, to put it nicely, really sucked. The heroine is an airhead and obviously has Stockholm Syndrome, and the ""hero"" is an arrogant jerk who doesn't change once he falls in ""love"". I am definitely a fan of J.L.'s books where the girl can take care of herself in almost every way and is not ""shocked"" by men and everything they do. Give me a heroine like Brenna (Fires of Winter)any day. She can fight with a sword and doesn't back down no matter what happens to her."
2,Badly Dated,"Readers should be aware that this study was first published in 1953, and despite light revision reflects the state of scholarship half a century ago. We've learned a LOT about the history of Christianity since then, and many of the sweeping assumptions of this book (e.g., in the ghastly section entitled ""The Darkest Hours: The Great Recession, A.D. 500-950"") have been thoroughly discredited. The bibliographies for each section don't include works published in the past half century (despite the so-called revision). Even the very language is dated, with its grandiose, sweeping style, capitalization of popes, etc. This book perpetuates a great many old myths, making the job of historians of religion just that much harder. There are now much better books on the market."
4,Ataturk,"Ataturk by Kinross is a good 'all-rounder,' it is informative, comprehensive, readable, and a great introduction to the subject of one of the most unique and successful revolutionaries in history."
1,Not the product pictured in description! Versus instead of Versace!!!,The cologne that you will receive is a cheap version of Versace Blue Jean. Instead of Versace you will receive Versus. I really do not expect to receive a knock-off from amazon but that is what I did receive! >:/
3,Genuine product ?,"Although may slightly differ from its original lable when intoduced in 1994, you can rest assure that this is a truly authentic product, and not some, ""KNOCK OFF"", as some reveiwers claim, they obviously either dislike the scent overall, or have never compared it to the original scent, because if they did they would not find any difference between the two, and as far as the labeling, reading ""VERSUS"" well for those who know anything about (versace) the parfume industry, knows VS. is versace, and versace is VS., and as for the rating for the overall product i gave, since when have you seen an outstading cologne sold for only $15.00, however, this stuff does has a decent smell when not overly broadcasted, and does not linger around making you nauseated. HENCE, if anyone still has their suspicions about the ""VERSUS"" line, and wish to confirm what i stated, you can look up ""VERSACE"" on wikipedia, and it will tell you exactly who they are !!!"
4,VERSUS BLUE JEANS,"THIS IS A GREAT FRAGRANCE FOR MEN. VERSUS IS A DESIGNER FRAGRANCE, A DESIGNER I HAVE SEEN ON MANY ITEMS, SO IT IS NOT A KNOCK OFF OF ANY KIND. IT IS A SCENT MY HUSBAND HAS PURCHASED MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS AND RECEIVES COUNTLESS COMPLIMENTS ON. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
5,compra,"Excelente producto, calidad excelente, entregado en los tiempos estipulados, muy buen vendedor, lo recomiendo para futura o futuras compra o compras."
2,"""Fall on your Knees"" Falls Short","Fall on your Knees is like watching a car wreck. You can't stop, though you know you should. No good feelings will come out of watching the wreck or reading this book. Afterwards you can't stop thinking about it although you know you should be doing and thinking about other things. All the main characters are tragically flawed whether inherently or due to circumstances. Whatever the case is, their lives proceed to the benefit of none and more than likely to the detriment to those around them. Not a feel good book. But if you are in the mood to poke your eyeballs out with a hot poker, you will enjoy this twisted family saga immensely."
2,"Maybe for some, not for most...","As an employee for [a local book store], the staff and I couldn't figure out what the big deal was about this book. I took it out on a loan, and I am certainly glad I did-- I would not buy this book after reading it. It's horribly redundant, terribly long, and overall confusing and difficult to read. The characters I couldn't care about-- they never touched me that way. Oprah Club books are depressing and full of angst- this novel was no different. Even still, it was hard to get into and in the end, after 2 days of a struggling read, I was glad it was over. It never gave me any lessons on life or an enlightened perspective- all it made me do was fall asleep."
2,"Gripping, but hardly optimistic","This book seems to never end in misery. It thrives on it. Right up until the very confusing end. It pretends to build up the book but then towards the last few pages it is prone to arid dryness except the last 10 pages, this book leads you on.. and then leaves you with nothing. I had to reread the last 50 pages to see if I missed anything... it gives vague ideas of what could have happened. It ended up being a wanna-be suspense book.The drama of the book is chaotic at times but I would still give it 2 stars only because I couldnt put it down the last 150 pages or so... dont let me convince you of that being its redemption.."
2,What is wrong with Oprah?,"This was a very strange, disgusting book. It was well written, however. I just don't like reading about incest. Why did Oprah hail this as being such a good novel? I am just bothered by the whole book."
3,Really strange story.,"The book was really strange, but good. I had a hard time keeping everything in perspective. The ending was really a surprise. It was difficult to think of it as ever being something that could happen in real life. I'm glad it was a novel, instead of non-fiction."
1,Totally depressing,"The author utilizes beautiful, descriptive language to describe the scenery and Canadian countryside, but don't let this fool you. This book is totally depressing, the characters are difficult to like, and the flow of the words make it difficult to read this book more than a chapter at a time. I was very depressed when I finished this book."
4,A book you won't want to put down!,"As with all of Oprah's selections, some people will read this book simply because she has recommended it. Others will refuse to read it simply because she has recommended it. Whichever camp you fall into, read this book for its own merits: expert storytelling, gorgeous prose, complex characters and plot, and a literary sensibility that elevates it above the tawdriness of its particulars.The Pipers of Cape Breton Island are haunted by secrets,forgotten memories, and sexual desires that carry them along like the waters of the creek next to their house. Although Kathleen's diary near the end weakens the magic of the rest, MacDonald's skill makes this a spectacular accomplishment. Like most of Oprah's selections, this one has a strong literary side without sacrificing accessibility, making it both a good read and an artistic journey.This is the kind of book you hold to your chest for a few moments before you put it down. Read it, and you won't regret it."
4,Prose at its finest,"I had a hard time putting this book down, many a sleepless night with this one!It is a multigenerational saga of a Nova Scotia family that displays disfunction at its finest. By the end of this book you will be thankful you were not born into that clan!At times, especially with Frances, I had a hard time keeping track of what is actually happening or what she is fabricating in her mind, but that is my only complaint.I look forward to reading more of this promising authors work in the future."
2,Very Depressing,"I have to agree with the reader from Canada. This is nothing against the writer, I thought she was terrific. However, this has to be one of the most depressing books I've ever read. This family isn't just dysfunctional, they're psychotic. I have to tell you that after reading this book, I really felt like I needed a shower! If you want to be really depressed, read this one!"
3,waste of my time,"I didn't even finish this book. after reading almost half of it, I didn't care enough to finish."
1,Hated It,"Even years after reading this book (long before it became popular) I can still remember it as one of the most boring, uninteresting and pointless reads of my life. The character's were dull and one-sided, the plot meandering, and the climax unfufilling. I'm saddened that it has become so popular of late, I can think of far more promising books to have in the spotlight such as Blonde by Joyce Carol Oates or Cat's Eye by Atwood. If you want to read a good book, please try one of those instead."
3,stick with it,"I read this book because it came to me highly recomended. I was a bit disappointed. The first 80 pages are incredibly boring but stay with it. I just finished the book and I'm not entirely sure what I thought about it. The story was powerful and complex but at times boring and confusing. I think that the story could have been shortened by about 100 pages. Overall it was alright, but there are definitely much better books out there."
2,Fall On Your Knees Falls Short...,"I laud Anne-Marie MacDonald for a beautifully woven, finely crafted novel. I could read her prose forever.But what I cannot get past is the fact that this is typical of an Oprah pick: 500 pages of dysfunction with the requisite rape, incest and misery void of redemption. It seems the modern benchmark for literary greatness is who can pack the most suffering into one long story. Truly great novels leave me wanting more and are marked not by the suffering of the characters, but the degree to which they rise above their circumstances.There are writers who combine well-written novels (which includes careful editing that respects readers' own intelligence) with fully-developed characters in stories that are moving, but ultimately hopeful and inspiring. If you want that mix, try Shade of the Maple ... or other great fiction."
1,Offensive literature,"I found the themes of rape, incest, and homosexuality offensive to my soul. Once again, a church-going Catholic is portrayed as a fanatic...I wish someone who is truly devout would make it into popular literature. This book is definitely NOT FAMILY MATERIAL...I wouldn't have it in a house with young children. I do not believe I'm a better person for having read it. The one redeeming feature of the book is the historical detail."
5,Madness and Religion,Intriguing family saga of the impact of mental illness and spiritualism gone wrong. The dept of emotion within each character - parents and siblings - brings understanding to their seemingly irrational behavior. Strong characters draw you into their thinking and justification of their actions. MacDonald does a fine job of weaving the plot around historial events that lend added dimension to the complex relationships and the story overall. An excellent read.
4,Survival,"I just finished the book. Excellent! The book is so well written on a subject of ""taboo..."" You will find that even though the subject matter is difficult to deal with and face, you can't put the book down. You keep going back to read it because you feel as if you are there, watching what is going on and the need to know what is going to happen next to each of the characters...The book does not diappoint. Read it, it's good."
3,Tragic story that held my interest,"This book was a page turner for me because of the plot. I enjoyed the many plot twist and turns which held my interest and kept me up at nights wondering what would happen next.The Piper family's story is a tragic one, and this family has to be one of the most dysfunctional families that I had ever read about, however I felt the writing was excellent and I really wanted to see what would happen next to these people although I was very dissapointed with the ending.I do have one complaint about the publishers reviews on the back of the cover which describe this book as ""Humorous"" and ""Hilarously Funny."" This book is sad and if you are looking for a laugh you will be mislead by the reviews.The characters and the plot is interesting, even though this is a tragic story. I recommend this book to people who enjoy plot twist but not to people who are looking for a fun book to read."
2,No fun in this dysfunctional family,"I agree with the reader who says this work was 500 pages of despair. Pick your sexual perversion: it's probably in here. What a depressing ""saga"". I gave it two stars, however, because of its ability to evoke times and places and because of its epic nature.I also agree that Oprah's picks seem to be stuck on certain themes: race, family dysfunction, secrets. Can we move on?"
5,Absolutely Unforgettable,"Quite simply, this is one of the best books I've ever read. I could not put it down and was so disappointed to see it end. I read it over a year ago and still think about it all the time!"
3,"Compelling reading, but dark and sometimes too winding","I liked this book but some of the narrative was too extreme for me. I've read a few other books in which the narrator lived in this part of the world, and those stories seemed to be about craziness and incest too. Is there something about the landscape there that makes you lose your mind and sleep with your blood kin?"
1,Depressing and depraved,"All I can say is I'm glad Oprah is giving her book club a rest after I read this book. When she first started her book club I read the first 4 books and decided that they all had one common theme centering a female and her struggles to get thru a horrible life. Reading one of her picks occasionally, I can see she has strived to find books with the same central theme. I found this book to have no point. It had mostly depressing points of view on life in general and had more than it's share of perverted plot twists. Because I absolutely hate to not finish a book, I forced myself thru this one. I really don't see what if any kind of point or lesson or morale this author had in mine or what she was trying to relay in her story."
5,"Absolutely Recommended, Fantastic Writing","This is wonderfully written novel! The descriptions of the town, the descriptions of a singing voice, the descriptions of a struggling family, this novel is written in a way that will paint lasting pictures in your mind. Though the main revelations in this novel have deeply disturbing undertones, both the detailed prose and the over-all layout (which skips between sequences and time) are fantastic. The personalities of each sister are laid out in a way that makes you feel as though you know them personally: the esteemed daughter, the caretaker, the sarcastic rebel, and the baby. Each chapter leaves the reader wanting a resolution, but it makes you wait to assemble the pieces and discover true conclusions. This book doesn't contain ""filler"", and I was certainly never bored. Although, I was disappointed when I finally finished reading this novel, and I have had a tough time finding another novel with such a complete, beautifully written storyline."
2,Aberrant Psychology,"When James met his future wife he wanted to say ""I know you"". You would think this was the beginning of a true love story. You would be very wrong. There is a lot of love in this book, but most of it is selfish and some is just perverse. The loved ones are often abused and traumatized by those who love them. I think the book is also trying to say something about racism, but I can't quite figure out what. The only reason I was compelled to finish reading this book was to see if anyone survived. Noone really did. This book left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The number of reviews readers have been compelled to write testifies that this book weighs heavily on the mind."
3,About a 3 1/2,"I didn't want to read this book. When I ran out of things to read, I read this book. It was confusing. When I got into it though, I had to do a little back reading to straighten it all out, but this is a good book. Don't read it with distractions."
1,Don't bother - explicit sexual content,"The only redeeming fact of this book is that the author does possess an aesthetic quality. As far as content, however, I consider it in the neighborhood of soft porn."
1,Utterly Depressing,"Ugh! How I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading this book. It is filled with gratitious sex, incest, and rape. It's as if the author wanted to throw in as much scandal as possible. Maybe she thought if she covered all the scandal bases she would get readership from those who are drawn in by those subjects. Furthermore, I disliked all of the characters in this book.Summed up: dark and depressing.p.s. What is with Oprah picks? Why are they also so depressing?"
2,A predicable Oprah book!,"After hearing Oprahs review on TV I could hardly wait to read this book, but like most of her recommended books it's about another dysfunctional family. I didn't find the book either interesting or entertaining, and the outcome was predicable."
1,Give me a break!,"The only thing that kept me reading this novel is morbid curiosity to see what new tragedy or ""shocking"" event the author would employ as an attempt to keep the reader interested. I guess that sort of worked. I did read (well...skim) this book to the end...unfortunately. However, I found myself laughing as each new ""plot twist"" was added, rather than relishing the story and attempting to relate to the characters. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,A Terrible Disappointment,"On the back of the edition that I read, a critic boasted that this book had a plot ""worthy of Hugo"" -- was he ever wrong. This plot is shallow and lacking in depth and substance. It is a typical work of modern fiction by an author who is trying too hard to impress. The characters are one dimensional, the setting is at times intriguing as it shifts and changes, yet overall this book was a lengthy string of prose that did not influence nor touch me. I found it too melodramatic. The effort she put into this is acute...yet, no one should try so hard. It is an unnatural work by someone hoping to evoke thought and poetry and failing miserably. Stay away. If you want a plot ""Worthy of Hugo"" read the real thing. Read Les Miserables or Toilers of the Sea and watch your emotions be tempest tossed, calmed, and soared through believable worlds and characters. I deduce you will be much happier."
3,Snorefest,"Am I the only one who found this book boring for 250 plus pages? I didn't like this book, not because it was sad. That's real life, and it WAS beautifully written, but because there was so many long, long passages of BORING sections that did not further the story line whatsoever..."
5,Amazing!!!!,"I was on this site looking for more works written by Ann Marie Macdonald as I found Fall on your Knees to be brilliant!I read it about a year ago and I still remember the book. It pops into my head now and then and I remember how captivated I was while reading it. I too thought about this book 24hrs a day for weeks after I finished it. The psychology in it is amazing. It kind of toyed with your mind and I loved it!I am pleased to see that The Way the Crow Flies is out now and I can not wait to go out and get it!Keep the excelent writing coming Ann Marie, I will be looking for it!"
2,What Is Wrong With Redemptive Fiction Now and Then?!!,"If you want a redemptive story featuring characters that are ""real"" but not consumed by incest or rapists (i.e. a challenging, yet ultimately uplifting, inspiring story), skip Fall on Your Knees and instead pick up ""In the Fall"" by Jeffrey Lent or ""Shade of the Maple"" by Kirk Martin. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am by Oprah's pick - a dark, depressing, unwieldy story."
2,Too much darkness for its own good.,"This novel is complex and there are too few parts that are compelling. The overwhelming tragic themes of rape, incest and murder are far too overdone. It seems that the writer creates tragedy for tragedy's sake, and it gets exhausting. This is a very depressing book, and I would not recommend it to the weak of stomach or those who are prone to becoming emotional. It's cruel, like it's characters. I really didn't like any of them nor did I come to care about them. I had to force myself to finish the novel."
2,I had to quit,"I don't usually quit reading a book, sticking with it until the end whether it is one of my favorites or not, but with this book, I just couldn't finish. I am an avid reader but found this book rather sick. I got tired of the relationship between Frances and Lily. I finally decided that I really didn't have to finish, so I quit."
1,"I tried to enjoy this novel, I really did...","...but I just couldn't. And for that reason I cannot recommend Fall on Your Knees. While it is well written, the story is just a series of tragedy piled upon tragedy. After a while, I couldn't care at all about any of the characters because I knew they were all doomed, and there was nothing in them to like anyway. In a nutshell, the novel is about a Canadian family that essentially destroys itself. Reading it is like watching a train wreck in slow motion over and over again -- too torturous and downright depressing. I appreciate books of this sort, for I am a sucker for novels with dark plots, but the aforementioned darkness here is just overkill. It's a shame though. I'd looked forward to reading something that would enthrall me, but this book just didn't do it for me. Disappointing read..."
1,No one is this awful - sick and sad,"The characters in this book just turned my stomach. I kept reading, hoping things would get better, but they didn't. The author has a unique style of writing, but the images she puts in your head are so unpleasant and disturbing that it almost gives you nightmares.I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,A page turner,I kept on wanting to read to find out what would happen tothese characters. The sisters are interesting characters.I can'twait to discuss this book with my book club members. There aresomany things I don't understand--why Francis wanted theparticular person to be the father of her baby. Why did Lily dowhat she did at the end of the book.
3,Disappointing,"I try to read every book that Oprah selects for her book club. Usually, I like or love the books. This one, however, was a disappointment. Since there are almost 600 reviews already, I will keep mine relatively brief.The novel is a multi-generational saga of shame, secrets and silence. The characters offer little more than their actions and behaviors which suggest victimization. However, the characterization is shallow and I did not get a deep sense of any of the characters.This could have been a much better book because the author writes well. However, the content was lacking. To be a good book, narrative and content should both excel.I can not recommend this book."
2,Fall on Your Knees,"One of the darkest and most depressing books I have read. If that's what you're looking for, this one is well written."
5,One of my All Time Fav's,"In some sort of fascination for the tragic, I was sucked into this book. Twice. It is absolutely beautiful. I went through a period of time when I was systematically reading through Oprah's book list and I believe this was my first choice. I was attracted to the cover. After the 7th or 8th book on the list, I realized her list was a compilation of the tragic. People in abusive situations overcoming their hardships. The theme lost its appeal after a while, but not before I read and fell in love with Fall on Your Knees. It reminded me of the classic Naturalist novel, McTeague in its inevitability for doom, but still finished out with hope. It is definitely not for everyone, but worth the read."
4,Better than most Oprah Book Club Choices,"I don't normally go for Oprah Book Club novels, but this one was really worth the read. It is extremely dark at times, but ultimately very engaging and moving."
5,Don't miss this book!,"This book is one of the best books I have read in a long time, and I read a lot. The characters became so believable, that I feel they are still with me! It got better with every chapter, all the way to the last page. I hated it to end, I want to read it again."
5,Excellent in every aspect,The price and shipping were far better than everyone else selling this item. Replacing the battery was a breeze. Battery does what is expected and lasts much longer than original. Great company to purchase from.
3,"Great beach book, but nothing more","The Outcast is great in that it is a great thriller in Grisham-style, but it lacks any real literary substance beyond the simplisitic story-telling method Latour uses. The flow of the story is a bit confusing, as he tries to flash forward nad backward and change perspectives of characters. However, the storyline is somewhat credible and provides a picture of the Cuban refugee in America."
4,A revelation,"This is an amazingly good book, for a number of reasons. Anyone who enjoys the novels of James M. Cain or Dashiel Hammett will eat this up. And anyone with an interest in Cuba or the Miami underworld is in for a treat. On top of all that, its just solid hard-boiled writing in the best crime fiction tradition. I can't believe this is the first novel Latour has written in English -- its so self-assured. Hopefully his past novels will be translated into English so we can get them here in the States. Again: if you're a fan of hard-boiled noir, READ THIS BOOK!"
3,Too Much That Doesn't Ring True,"There is a certain conceit in billing a book ""The first in the Max Mingus series"". This book was ok, but I won't be leaping for number two in the series. Mingus is undeveloped as a character. At times he speaks like the gritty street tough Hammett private eye, but on the next page he is waxing philosophical with nary a four-letter word or grammatical error.The book takes place in Haiti after the American invasion. Despite the repititious and redundant pages upon page of descriptions of Haiti's poverty, surprisingly, the flavor of the island and its people never gets through.The plot is ok, but there are a few facets that are way too convenient. Max is aided by the all-powerful drug kingpin who ends up being the misunderstood good guy under the criminal stereotype.If you're stuck on a plane and need something to get you through, this book is ok, but there are a whole host of p.i. mysteries far superior."
1,"Boy, was this a mistake!!!","I am in complete agreement with the other reviews I have read about this product. Unfortunately, I didn't read them before I bought the Pinnacle Systems PCTV Pro. Besides most of the other *bugs* listed,(eg. audio-sync problems, lack of basic editing functions in the main program, and no radio tuner) I have found that the PCTV mysteriously turns itself on at random times throughout the day even when nothing has been scheduled to record.The documentation is terrible. The support website is full of dead links or loops that send you back to where you started without an answer to your question or a hint of how to find one.I would not recommend the Pinnacle Systems PCTV Pro."
5,Good,"I like the Artemis heel smoother, and these are the replacement tips. The tips don't last all that long, depending upon your own expectations. But I find this product to be the best for smoothing down the feet and toe area, including cuticles. This product is much better than the foot smoothers that use razor blades or cheese graters (ouch) and is easier to use than a pumice bar, since it is sort of a pumice bar on batteries. I stocked up on a bunch of these tips to keep well supplied for a while."
4,I'm a speaker & CD case.,"I've been looking for a convenient way to play music from my Tungsten T without headphones and this is it. I've looked at other portable speakers, but there were too many wires to them. The sound quality is quite good, it won't fill a room; but for personal listening or a small gathering of friends it works great. It takes three AAA batteries which seem to last quite awhile, I haven't had to change the batteries yet(it's been about three weeks since I've had it-but I don't use it continuously). The only thing missing is something to boost the bass, then again it's not designed to replace a boombox. There is another version with only one speaker built in, but it holds half the CD's. I only gave 4 stars because of the bass, it's still great addition to my collection of CD player, PDA, and MP3 player. Now if they could only come up with one with a multi-player connector..."
4,Handy when you're travelling,"I've had both the small & large Imaspeaker, and the only way to get really decent sound is have two, and to run a Y-connector from your player to the Imaspeakers. I've run various AM/FM/SW radios, a CD player, & now my MP3 player to 1 or 2 of the smaller small Imaspeakers when away from home"
5,Great Product,"I saw this product on the tv show The View.They were showing Christmas gifts for under thirty dollars. I checked it out on Amazon and ordered 2 of them.I wish I had bought more for gifts.Everyone at our family Christmas party wanted one.So I plan to purchase more.The product is great,the stereo sound is wonderful.I only could offer TDK one sugestion.Where you put your portable Cd player should have a flap with velgro to make it easier to open the cd player to change cds and not have to take the whole Cd player out.Other then that I would recommend this product to everyone.Great gift for someone that has everything.Great for the beach,pool,deck and light weight so you can take it anywhere you want to and listen to your favorite cds.Try one and you will want to buy another"
2,Not very durable.,"I purchased Mr. Scrambles for my nieces 3rd birthday. It worked once and then it would not work again; even after a fresh battery change. I emailed Fat Brain Toys and they were very prompt and kind about sending a replacement. I was very impressed with the customer service I received. However, the replacement is just as bad, so I definitely can not recommend this toy to anyone."
4,Can't understand why the movie isn't being distributed nationally instead of limited,"This is the first movie made from one of Anthony Horowitz's exciting Alex Rider books about a reluctant teen spy for England's secretive MI6 agency. The movie makes the bad guys (and certainly gals, too) seem a bit comical by American standards, but the book has them much more threatening and smart. Still, my 10-year-old son adores the series AND this movie. We'll buy the DVD as soon as it's out, which I understand is supposedly slated for Dec 19. It's too bad more American kids don't know the series because it is very exciting, and the audio book reader is excellent as well. Note that there is plenty of violence in the book, but it is substantually toned down in the movie (remarkable!)."
4,Was ok,"The reason I thought it was ok, was because I have only read the firstBook and I kind of like the movie, so if you have read the book, youMight be ok with it, like I was. But if you have not read the books thenI think think you should see the movie!"
1,Could it get worse?,"This was possibly the stupidest movie I have ever seen. It was nothing like the book. In an attempt to keep a PG rating, all the excitement, action and violence was washed out, leaving something more like a comedy than an action movie. If you've read Stormbreaker, I beg you not to see this movie. If you've already seen the movie, I beg you to read the book instead."
1,"uh, yeah.","looks good in the picture and on the vehicle, however after about two months the ""M"" disappeared. I tossed it because I was then driving a ""G C""."
1,He is Hanging on cause of Frankie J who actually has talent,This album is GARBAGE i cant even listen to it I dont know how he got a record deal I think a child could write better rymes than him BABY BASH I DONT THINK U WILL BE AROUND THE MUSIC BIZ FOR A LONG TIME
1,for all yall,"For all yall who think this is a 5 star rap album. Cus it's not. I bet you everyone who gave this more than a 2 don't even who Tupac,Biggie,Nas,Jay-z are. Yall some stupid little 13 year old gurls buyin this album. Please save your time,money and ears from this ......."
1,skip this book!,"If you are interested in finding out about where to stay or where to eat in the delightful area of Provence, skip this book. It is filled with cultural and historical information but contains absolutely nothing relevant to someone traveling in France. This book is better suited for someone who is interested in the history behind some of the regional sights. There are essentially no practical facts or travel tips included. After perusing it, I didn't even take it on my trip. In addition, the maps in this book are in no way a substitute for the maps published separately by Michelin, especially if you are planning to rent a car. I strongly recommend Frommer's Guide instead supplemented by Michelin maps. My Green Guide is on its way back to Amazon!"
4,A different molecular biology textbook,"This book offer an interesting viewpoint about cell biology. I believe that this textbook is principaly for those who are looking for different treatment of the most basic issues in molecular biology. I mean, different from the common viewpoint that the english-speaking authors commonly offers and, of course, always maintaining the accuracy in all topics. Easy to read and very clear in the explanations. It's written by two argentinian authors ( father and son ) and its firts edition was in 1940. The last edition in spanish was in 1995 and is totally up-to-date. There were traductions at least in ten languages, including english."
1,not brake pads,"this are not brake pads , there was something I don't know what it is. so I had to get brake pads again."
1,Save your money,"This product sounded like a cute item. The first one I tried was the herb thyme. It never sprouted. Then I tried mint. A few strings appeared after weeks. Still it struggles, but I do not expect it will get beyond the few strings that sprouted. I will go and buy a mint plant."
5,Excellent memento of a magical evening,"This DVD, filmed in September 1999, is an excellent buy for all Deep Purple fans. While not every single song they did at the shows is contained here (the CD has several extra tracks), it does contain the three most important: Movements I, II, and III of the classic Concerto for Group and Orchestra, first performed thirty years ago when Ritchie Blackmore was in the band. Here, Steve Morse does a wonderful job of replacing Blackmore, adding his own more modern style to the proceedings. Everyone plays quite well, and it's fun to see Ronnie James Dio and the other two guys from the Steve Morse band join in.It must be said, watching it makes me feel like I'm watching PBS, what with the orchestra and all. But even the most heavy of hard rock fans will realize that it is Deep Purple's night to shine."
3,Halloween music,"Not the original artists, but still very close to their song. Very similar to the other Halloween CD. Get one or the other, preferably the other so you can get the actual artists who made the hits."
4,Wonderful Idea Beautifully Executed,"So practical and so precious. I don't know how I lived without it before. A perpetual calendar is a great idea and of course, one illustrate by M.E. is as timeless as the idea."
3,Great toilet read,"I first encountered Molvania through the music video from Zlad. I later browsed the rest of their website, finding several entries rather humerous. Including the country's use of the triple negative; 'is it not that the water is not not undrinkable?' Or, 'can I drink the water?'After purchasing it, I found it great for those times I have 10-15 minutes to sit down and read. Many of the jokes are the same theme through the whole book, so reading it longer than that in one sitting would tire me out quickly.For the price, it provided me with ample entertainment, and I will be passing it along to my father, and a friend or two after that, providing them with the same."
3,I beg to differ ...,"... with the previous review. I used this text whilst studying second year igneous and metamorphic petrology (in Australia where the book is ~AUS$90 = ~US$45.) I found Raymond's writing style and use of language to be entirely appropriate for a text aimed at this level - if you are studying a science there is no point hiding from the jargon - the faster you learn it the more easier it will be at higher levels.Raymod gives a good general overview of igneous and metamorphis petrology (I have not used this text for sedimentary petrology,) though I did find on some occasions that I was left wanting more detail, eg. regarding calc-alkaline basalts. However, the book is easy to read, and posses something that is often overlooked - figures and tables are generally kept on the same 2 page spread as the text refering to them. Colour reproductions of photomicrographs would be a welcome addition to a future edition."
1,Real Stinker,I absolutely loved this book by Lavyrle Spencer. I thought since Christopher Reeve was in this movie it might be good. But I was WRONG! This stunk. The story varried a lot from the book. The plot was poorly developed. A very sensitive love story beautifully told was ruined. I know Lavyrle Spencer must be ashamed at this depiction of her story.
3,Miss Congeniality is better,"Although this movie is a lot more realistic, and bitchier at the same time. Kirsten Dunst's & Denise Richards' would be eye gouging and hair pulling is so good, it's funny. The 'documentary-style' of the movie is quite inventive, although it does slip back into normal movie mode sometimes.What makes Miss Congeniality better than this, is that Miss Congeniality lasts longer, while the whole pageant of this doesn't last long in the movie, and the rest of it is made up of what happened before & after.The cast are excellent, and Brittany Murphy has a worst laugh than Sandra Bullock does in Miss Congeniality, it's so funny! She doesn't appear on screen for long though!Overall, this is a good, although slightly tedious movie, with one of the most original covers around!"
1,Avoid At All Costs,"While this movie does have a few funny moments, almost all of it is almost physically painful to watch. The worst offender by far is Kirstie Alley and her accent although the ending was almost as bad. And pointless."
2,Awful!,"I bought this movie because it had two of my favorite actresses in it, Kirstie Alley and Kirsten Dunst. I was however completely dissapointed in the movie and ended up giving it away. The idea of the plot was good, which is why it merits 2 stars but what they ended up with was terrible. It wasn't funny at all. If you want a good teen movie instead, get Down To You, 10 Things I Hate About You or She's All That!"
2,PATHETIC,"Well the my title says it all. Pathetic! Yes it had its really funny moments, but otherwise it was a mistake. What were they thinking! Did they actually think it could be a hit? I like Kirsten Dunst, but in this movie she was wasting her time. The plot was bad, the acting was bad, the writing was bad, well just about everything was bad. Horrible! How could did I even watch the whole thing. Just when you think the movie is getting good someone cracks a dumb joke or something so stupid happens that it completely covers up the very evry very few good parts in the movie. No good. Rent something else!"
4,BRILLIANT MOVIE!,"I must say when I first watched this I couldn't stop laughing, the movie is definately well worth it. It's very well made, mocumentary style like the blair witch project, its very clever and extrememly well cast. DDG is a lot of fun to watch, especially since it focuses on America's obssesion with beauty pageants. I loved Kirstie's silly little accent and Ellen Barkin is quite a comic genius. Kirsten Dunst has blossomed a lot since interview with a vamp and gives an enjoyable performance. Also cudos to Denise Richards for looking so damn fine and for that Jesus love song, probably the funniest scene in the whole movie. The only reason the dvd got 4 stars was because I was disapointed for it not having a lot of extras, just the trailer. BUT its still worth the money!"
5,Drop Dead Fantastic !,"This is undoubtedley one of the best films of this year. The jokes are sharp and witty, the plot is original and complex, the cast are magnificent, particularly Kirsten Dunst (Dick, Interview With the vampire, Little Women), they all have a wonderful rapport, and they play off each other. Kirstie Alley sparkles in her best role to date, as the organiser of the paegent. See this film in the cinema, see it on video, see it on DVD, but SEE IT !"
4,Beauty pageant politics to the max!,"This movie is a bit monolithic, but a couple of characters could have been taken from ""Sordid Lives"" (very funny stereotypes). Kirstie Alley does a great job portraying a blinded-by-glory driven mother, pushing her little darling to ""stardom"" by some rather unconventional methods. The story is an indictment of beauty pageants and the extremes some parents will go to, and this one contains some amusing dark humor."
4,replace your worn video tape...,"So, the only reason this doesn't get five stars is that the person/people who put it on dvd were not fans. There is nothing extra or fun, not even a good menu. The audio is exactly the same as my old tape, which I watched so many times that I know exactly where the sound dips or blurbs. They are in the same places, so it is an exact replica. If that is fine with you, and your old tape is as worn as mine, then buy this dvd. D&A are the best and this deserves preservation."
5,Great 2 in 1 grooming tool,"This tool works perfectly! The rough side really pulls out all of that loose fur but beware - it will be a hairy mess! My cats can't sit still long enough for me to fully clean them but with the little I get in, I can generate a pretty big fluffball on the floor. The slicker side works great at getting everything else out, so it's definitely worth it."
5,A DIVINE EXPERIENCE,"THIS BOOK WILL GIVES DETAILS ABOUT PRESENT INCARNATION OF GOD, BHAGAWAN SRI SATHYA SAI BABA. A GOOD BOOK FOR SPIRITUAL SEEKERS AND ALSO FOR THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING PEACE AND SELFLESS LOVE."
5,Great movie and great seller!,This is a very special movie and I was so glad to be able to find it. It was my son's favorite movie when he was a little boy. The seller delivered it promptly and I had no problems whatsoever. Thanks so much.
5,HOW DID THEY DO IT !? FANTASTIC SEASON!,Senfeld had an amazing run and from season 3 they keep going and never looked back. Some of the most brillant comedy ever! This season DVD set is essential!
5,"Seinfeld Season 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9",This is a great show and I was glad to get it on DVD at such a great price
3,"Greatest sit com Ever made, BUT ....","I cant tell you how much I like this show, but after Michael Richards blew up on stage and crossed many a line ... I have to say, watching this show is quite different to me now .."
2,Mixing sucks,There is two big problems with this CD. The mix sucks big time. Too much emphasizing the solo instrument while pushing back everything else too much. The other is the less than stellar performance by the bass player. And then they (the producer I guess) continue to bring him to the font with lousy uninspired long solos... Stay away.
3,Not Small,"These bowls are huge! Each holds an entire quart. I'm keeping them because they match the plates and tumblers I already bought for my RV, but I wish they were smaller.EDIT:I've since removed them from my RV. They are just too big. Zak Designs, please make these in a smaller size!"
5,Ricardo Beverly Hills Cosmetic Tote WONDERFUL,"This tote is sturdy and attractive and just the right size for taking cosmetics, toiletries and hair appliances on your next trip. I already had the smaller size, but this one enables me to take more items but still have a compact, easy-to-carry toiletry bag. It has handy partitions and pockets and is lined just in case there is a leak. I am really enjoying my bag!"
5,Grohe Alira Kitchen Faucet,"This is an outstanding product. The faucet works smoothly and flawlessly, a testament to good engineering and design. After reading other reviews about installation I decided to have a professional install the unit which took about an hour including a trip to the hardware store to purchase extension water lines and saved me a lot of frustration. The most difficult portion of the installation was the removal of the old faucet whose mount was corroded and took some expertise and strength."
1,Car charger broke after only a few uses,"I received this combo pack a few months ago. I purchased it mainly for the car charger, and I probably used it 2-3 times per month. It felt a bit flimsy, but worked fine for a few times. Today, I pulled it out of the cigarette lighter, and the contact point had broken off from the rest of the charger. The plastic is in 4 little pieces now, so I cannot repair it. It was a great deal, but next time I would pay a bit more for something that is more substantial. I have not used the other items in this combo."
5,X-wing is a great series,i have read all but perhaps 2-4 of the star wars novel and x-wing is a solid series which is definitely worth reading
4,A great book in a great series,"X-Wings, tie fighters, evil Imperial plots, a traitor, and some really great characters(good and evil) all add up to another star wars thrillfest in this highly praised X Wing series. I have heard a lot of hype about this series and only recently started reading it. The first book was really good and this book is even better. The great Star Wars trademark action is here and the plot is very well thought out. The action is relentless but never gets on your nerves becasue it isn't just filler. Like I said, a very satisfying plot with action, mystery, solid dialogue, and even a little romance thrown in there. A great read that will leave you wanting more and there are no disappointments there because the series runs to 8 or 9 books so far."
4,Exciting,Stackpole has done a really good job on this book. He really captures your imagination and puts you at the scenes of the battle. You can just imagine yourself in the Bacata Tanks after the attack.
5,Inspirational,Unbelievable & inspiring autobiography of a young boy bullied in school for being the dumbest in the class to one of the top international neurosurgeons.
4,Good book but editors are baffoons,"I read this book, and it was pretty good, but what really ticks me off is the beyond-idiot quote from readers digest on the front cover. Once in a strange rage he almost stabbed a friend with his new knife. This was a one time thing, it happened in an argument in the friends bedroom, not in the streets. When he went home he was a ashamed and determined to control this anger problem before it grew into anything. How on earth does that constitute 'knife weilding street fighter'?! It is as if readers digest did not even read the book themselves. Fools like this should not be allowed such positions in life. Perhaps they should have a an assisted living center for all such idiots--- it would be cheaper than paying them money to embarrass their own intelligence--- but with the same purpose-- have other people take care of all their needs, because they cant make it on their own."
4,Amazing Story,We have been fascinated with Ben Carson's experiences and all he has been able to accomplish. We continue to refer his book to friends.
4,Inspiring,Very good book for the young people in our lives. As a father I see many teaching moments in this book. Quick read good for the soul.Tim
4,Inspirational & Educational,"This novel was a great instrument inspiration that provides uplift and surgical education. Carson provides a set of directions as well as a list of ingredients to produce the dish of success. He gives advice to youths about how to deal with stress and how to maintain emotional wellness while living in the high school and college atmospheres. Dr. Carson bestows this advice through the telling of his personal story; he told his mistakes so that others will not make the same bad decisions. Likewise, Carson gives a detail description of surgical procedures as well as an in-depth insight into the surgical world. Rearmost, from reading these text one will gain an immense amount of inspiration and a small amount of education as well."
1,Payed for destroyed paper.,"So I bought this paper since the paper I have been using is a 20lb weight with 90 brightness... However, when I received the package, I pulled out the paper and it had a wrinkle half way up the side of the paper. That is not including that the package was dropped on its side and therefore the paper had been ruined on one corner anyways - I hadn't noticed until after I had already opened the package. Well, now I have a $10 bundle of 500 sheets of scrap paper."
1,In A Perfect World...,"...this would be a great retro game. Problem is, half of the titles won't load. Flat out - this game don't work. Period."
1,NOT Vegetarian!,"This item has a very misleading description. The capsules themselves may be vegetarian, but the ingredients are NOT vegetarian. Buyer beware--chondroitin is made from animal cartilage."
2,Bad habit continues!,"This is the second product we have tried as a deterrent to help our 8 month old Havanese break his nasty habit of recycling his stool. We have tried the ""home remedies"" and thought we would try a couple of the vet recommended products. The Potty Mouth brand worked no better and even less than our other methods. Maybe your dog will do better with this product, but we wouldn't buy again."
1,Doenst work,dont waste your time or money this product doesnt work. tried it with two breeds of dogs. still eating poo
1,Doesn't work,This is the second box of this that we have purchased plus the powder and neither work. Our Yorkies have been eating their poop since 6 wks old and we have tried everything to stop it and their almost 8 months old.Waste of money
1,Waste of time and money,"I used this for several weeks on my two older Shih Tzu dogs, then tried it again with two young Shih Tzu puppies. It does not work at all. The feces eating didn't change or slow down. Controlling what they eat, by not giving them treats with strong odors or any human foods, and cleaning up the mess after they poop is the only way I've found to get a handle on it. Buy it if you want, but don't expect big results."
4,Very entertaining!!,Bought this movie for my five years old. I must say he really loves it. He watched the entire movie!!! That's preety amazing considering he can't stay put for 45 minutes.
3,Not good for prolonged use,"Distorted sound. Pronounced tone when noise canceling is active. Feels like vise grip after a couple hours. I ordered this Skullcandy model but got the rebranded version by Amp'D mobile, which may be a reason for the low quality. I need headphones to drown out all the shenanigans at the office. After about two hours of continuous use, these things gave me a headache. The tight fit puts a lot of pressure on my head which rests on a 130 pound frame. So I don't think it's because I'm fat. The noise canceling creates a low-pitched hum which you can hear even through music. Finally, the sound is often distorted. Now I have to go back to my Shure earphones which tend to slip out of place. I would not recommend the SC Proletariat to a friend."
1,Not what was advertised!!!,"I ordered 3 Skullcandy SC-NC Proletariat noise Canceling Headphones, and received 3 Amp'd Mobile Active Noise Canceling Headphones. Vibecellular is doing a bait and switch! From my research it seems that they may actually be the same product, at least by the looks of them, but who knows for sure. I do know that sometimes one multiple brands are SIMILAR, and made in the same factory, but may using inferior components. Besides Amazon sells them for $18.00!!!! I bought them on BLACK FRIDAY, for $23. I'm reporting this seller, and doing a charge back if this is not taken care of.Amp'd Mobile Noise Canceling Headphone XQS-109"
1,wrong item,"Ok, I too ordered these when they were 25$ and received the amp'd mobile ones instead stating that ""This headset is manufactured by skullcandy for Amp'd Mobile."" If that is the case, then why can I find these exact headphones for 18$ elsewhere on Amazon? If I'm going to buy skullcandys, I'm going to get skullcandys. Sending these back for a refund today."
3,"Cheap headphones, good for a backup","I got these for around $15-20.They are pretty cheaply made and shitty headphones, but, they are probably worth the price as a backup pair.If you want high quality, look elsewhere."
4,Fine noise cancelling phones at this pricepoint,"I almost never buy a product which doesn't have a decent review written about it anywhere online, but I decided to take a chance with these cans. Briefly, the noise cancelling works extremely well, they're comfortable, and they fold up into a very small package for being over the ear phones (with my ears, anyways). That said, I was very disappointed with the sound quality when the noise cancelling was turned off, although when turned on they sound really good on the low end, even if the highs are somewhat muted. My only concern at this point is how long the batteries will last since there's no way I'm going to use these without the noise cancelling turned on."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The application doesn't function as it did in previous years. The interface is not very impressive at all. Once you complete entering your donations and save the file, it is practically impossible (following the instructions) to import your contributions into H&R Block @ Home Deluxe 2009. I was absolutely stunned. Now, i'm afraid to use the software since it is so buggy. I'm mailing it back to H&R Block in Kansas City."
1,it looks the same,this phone looks the same the only thing that change is its features man the best is the T630
1,You're not dealing with AT&T,"Where do I start?AT&T sucks. From next to zero coverage to TERRIBLE customer service, you will hate this phone. I have had to wait on hold longer than an hour every time I have called ""customer care"". Half the time I call I am told that AT&T is unable to answer my call at this time. When I am finally connected the staff on the other end is neither helpfull or curteous. In fact, they are rude and useless. They read their script very well, but it does nothing towards solving my problems.More than that. The fine print will be sure to more than double your plan costs.My recomendation:Anyone but AT&T"
2,Disappointed,"The phone is difficult to use, with such a small keypad and the display, while crisp, is difficult to see unless you have a magnifying glass. Pictures taken with the phone are grainy, and quality is really bad. As for sending the pictures via AT&T, expect nickel-and-dime charges for the data transfer. I am returning my phone to AT&T and cancelling my service (still within 30 day guarantee)."
2,Worst reception ever,"I love the look and style of this phone, but by far it has the WORST reception I've ever heard. I am CONSTANTLY dropping calls, and there can be very bad interference/static on my calls. I thought this was just a fluke, complained to AT&T (when it still was) and they sent me a new phone. Still having all the same problems!! The camera is probably below average aswell. Though this is an older phone and I don't expect people to be buying it, I warn you, don't!!"
2,AT&T Customer Service SUCKS! Great Phone.,"AT&T customer service sucks. I was with Sprint PCS before, and their customer service was far better. I am regretting the move. BEWARE OF AT&T.Great phone. Good features. But in a noisy environment you would not hear what the other party is saying. The maximum sound (both ringer and call volume) in this phone is almost equal to the minimum sound with my previous Samsung A500 Sprint phone.Other than the issue with the audio volume I am very happy with the phone, but once again AT&T has a very bad customer service. I would not recommend anyone to come to AT&T."
3,Pros and Cons,"PROs: It is small, and it is useful for making and receiving 'phone calls. You can customize the background picture and the ring tones (but can't use tones in mp3 or AAC formats). The Bluetooth is great.CONs: Camera function is pitifully low in quality, really a joke, so you may wish to load good quality pictures from your Mac. The Sync for addresses works, but unfortunately the formatting of the files means that businesses are listed separately from individuals, and many entries do not end up in proper alphabetical order. Advanced features like email and Internet access are essentially worthless, and cost extra; in no way can they compare with a laptop computer. Needs much more memory and reliable address-formatting. Code for making custom ring-tones is cumbersome and impractical to do on the 'phone: needs mp3 and AAC compatibility to be any real fun."
3,Glaring Omissions,"Sony has a knack for making the easy things hard. My address book (synced with Outlook) has 470 entries. Sony forces me to search this list BY FIRST NAME. Note to Sony: There is a reason phone books are ordered by last name. Many other features on this phone are harder to access than they should be. I vastly prefer my Siemens M56, which, in spite of its acknowledged flaws, is just easier to use. That said, this phone has a nice display and keyboard, a marginally adequate camera, and works well with Bluetooth."
4,Best Phone for the money,"I am in the same boat with other owners. Excellent phone for the money but the software that comes with it is VERY old. You hear that ATT!! Why you ship with an old software??? Because they want you to pay $$$ to upgrade through their service center.Anyway, After reading some of the reviewers here and they recommend me to get the tool to unlock and upgrade the software easily and cheap. check it out for your self (unlockcellular.com) if you dont believe me or do like me, read the past reviews."
1,Horrible,Bad instructor and not a good workout. I can barely stand to watch it. It was a true waste of money.
2,Misleading,"I love NOW products and I have used Co-Q ten before. However, i supposed what i am most upset about is that the picture on the ad says 100 soft gels. However the product I received has only 50 soft gels. If i would have known there was only 50 i would have gone with another brand."
4,"Great product, but advertisers beware","I opened the box in my tiny college dorm room looking for something will blast music onto the academix quad outside my window. This does the job perfectly! It does a great job for a 450 watt system. But wait, didn't Amazon claim this to be 500 watts? I don't know where that came from, but the consumer should know that and I am surprised that this has not been picked up on yet.After reading few of the other testimonials I noticed that I was not the only one to have problems hearing voices through the speakers. Oddly enough, after about 10 min of use, it sounded perfect and the singers came through clear as a bell. One more thing, make sure you either have coax, optical, or a three minijack sound card to make sure you get full use out of all the speakers. Overall a GREAT product."
1,TWO DEFECTIVE UNITS IN A ROW,"I received the first set of speakers. Worked ok for about 2 days. After that a loud hissing in the speakers would drown out the sound. I called Logitech and let them hear what was going on. They said the speakers were defective & to send them back. I received the second set. They worked ok for 1 day before the subwoofer went out. I replaced the fuse thinking that might be the problem, but nothing.....DON'T BUY THEM. THEY ARE NOT RELIABLE!!"
4,Z-680,"Received these about 2 days ago, lugged them in the house and set it up. No problems, set up was a snap. I've tried the setup with DVD's (DTS and reg. Dolby Digital) and it sounds great. I invested in a SB Audigy 2 card a while back and these speakers really take advantage of it. I have noticed a hiss from the speakers. Logitech's site has an entry in the FAQ about it that states its completely normal. It caused me to move the center channel to a place where its less noticeable. Again, this is what the FAQ suggested. Only two gripes. First, I really would like to have a digital hookup to the Audigy rather than plain old analog. Second, its going to be hard to upgrade to monster cable (if I later decide to) since the hookups on all the speakers (except the center channel) are the lug type. None of these sink the set since it looks and sounds great. Just keeps it from being a '5'. Worth every penny."
1,LETS TRY THIS AGAIN,"MAN THIS BOOK WAS SO BORING,NOTHING TO KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE.TOOK ALL I HAD TO FINISH READING IT.WASTED MY TIME,PLEASE DONT WASTE YOURS"
4,This is what Latin jazz should sound like...!,"An impressive album by Cuban pianist Roberto Fonseca, who took over the piano chair in the Buena Vista Social Club after Ruben Gonzales left in '01. Fonseca draws on seemingly limitless styles and resources, and a soulful sense of melody that sets this album apart from many run-of-the-mill Latin jazz workouts: he plays with soul and sensitivity, exploring a rich emotional reservoir that will offer plenty of rewards to receptive listeners. If you're looking for new Latin jazz material that really does justice to both traditions (and doesn't just mash them together), check this album out!"
4,Thanks,Thanks so much for getting this to me so fast! I love this cd and listen to it almost everyday!!!
1,Language,"I thought that this dvd comes in spanish language but it only comes in french and english, I made a mistake ordering this item."
4,Good Resource,"I got the book, it is old and had a few notes and papers in it, but otherwise, it came on time and was in good shape. it is very useful. I love AMAZON!!!!"
1,Foul mouthed bad movie,I have no idea why Red Box would say this is appropriate for all ages. We had to turn it off because of the swearing.
1,Techno geek designs?,"If you want real logos and business sign designs, forget it! If you want 'upscale chic modernistic' european disco artwork-then probably that's what this is! Nothing from North America-very limited in color usage, etc. Bulk of what we looked through was no different than the unused CD's of 'artwork' we got with an old 100,000 clipart design set!I would NOT recommend this to anyone thinking this will give them good layout and design ideas to show USA customers...unless they are opening a modernistic computer age boutique..."
2,Not what I expected,"The logos are contemporary, no doubt about it. But unfortunately they are much too hip (if not crude and often provocative) to be of much use to me. It looks like they were all designed to appeal to angst-driven 20-somethings. The logolounge series contains contemporary logos that reflect a broader business sensibility."
4,Great overview with lots of data,Where to start on a fascinating subject? There is so much data in this book it's unbelievable. The authors are all experts and provide a wealth of information on animal studies and related human perspectives.
3,Wrong replacement parts,I ordered batteries for my child's Razor E100 Electric scooter and received the wrong batteries. I am not sure how to have them replaced. Thanks!
5,The best introduction to Spinoza,"Scruton's ""Spinoza"" is an excellent introduction. Although Spinoza is not in vogue, Scruton reminds us of why it is important to study ""past masters."" I recommend that anyone that intends to read Spinoza's ""Ethics"" first read Scruton's introduction. By reading Scruton first, the reader will have a much more enjoyable and fulfilling experience."
2,Extremely short,"This book is VERY short, you can easily read it in an hour. For me it was only useful in determining whether or not to read other, more complete books on the same subject. I snapped it up at six bucks figuring any book at that price was a bargain, but now that I have whipped through all 54 pages, it actually seems kind of expensive.The actual content was clear and useful. But it would be better presented as a single chapter in a broad introductory text covering many philosophers."
3,WTF,This EP costs more than the new full lenght. Don't get me wrong it's a great EP but it cost $10 while the new full length cost's $8. Doesn't make sense to me.
4,A good detangler for the price,"I liked this detangler, made my hair detangled quicklyMakes hair feel soft and not waxy, oily, or crunchyA great find for the price!"
5,A New wave film about the childhood!,"I do not believe in children ingenuity . They do not know it . This bitter but sensate affirmation belongs to Gustav Mahler .And so this film, with the astonishing imagination of Louis Malle -a promising and famed director by then with previous notable works such Elevator to the gallows and The lovers- literally dives in an unknown ocean : adult's world satire (but without the bitterness of the 400 blows this giant film of Francois Truffaut filmed just two years before) through the eyes of a child with the New Wave condiment .The result was a joyous film . An exceedingly funny picture , delicate, outrageous , vulgar nightmarish way. From start to finish a winner film .And please realize and make an imaginative journey : this film clearly precedes to Amelie in its giocoso and joy of living spirit . Do not you ?"
4,Great Read,This book was selected by a member of my book club. It has proved to be a great read and I would highly recommend it.Great story that has multiple levels and plots that weave together nicely.
3,pretty good,"I was looking for something to help me relax during my pregnancy, and to have positive affirmations to help with planning for an unmedicated natural homebirth. The music was just OK (some tracks i had to skip) & the affirmations were fine (no music on tracks with affirmations). I did like that these were short, so I could listen for 5 min and didn't need like a 20 minute block of time. But, I think if I had to buy again I would go with Belleruth Naparstek, since I think her affirmations/meditations (I used while trying to get pregnant) are more in depth, and more useful, and in fact I used hers when I was in labor. That being said, I did have a great labor and delivery at home, so maybe these were useful afer all!"
2,Limited Visualizations and Meditations -- Not Worth the Expense,"Given the number of tracks on this CD, I was looking forward to a variety of meditations and music to support them. However, most tracks have a one sentence meditation (no music!!) with very limited vizualizations for you to use. I've found many other CDs out there which provide a more comprehensive meditation and visualization experience for less money. Not an item which I would recommend spending your money on."
3,Signing Naturally vocabulary level 2,Hand written entries are hard to read. This book is not the same as the text that I own. Some of the vocabulary does not match
2,"Gives good light, but a real pain to install","These are nice, once they are installed, but they are among the most difficult lights I've ever installed. First, the ""hinged design"" on the diffuser mean you have to bend and tweak the diffuser to get it off. Next you will notice that not only does it not come with bulbs, it comes with absolutely no hardware at all. Not even wire nuts are included. Once you get theT8 Bulb, wire nuts, and screws to mount it with, and wire it up, you realize that the only way to install the wiring shield is to disassemble the connectors for the light-bulbs. Disassembly is easy, but getting the little machine screws to bite to reinstall it is non-trivial once the light is hanging. Anut driveris *highly* recommended for this job as you will drop the screws, and probably lose them, using a flat-head screw driver.Once up, they are OK, but I'd prefer something that is simpler to install."
5,Lots of Light - no buzz,Great price - Great Lights and do not make the noise the T12 bulbs make. I got the brightest tubes sold at Lowes and the lights provide ample light for my storage facility. I recommend these lights for garages and out buildings and even in a house given the right atmosphere.
3,Ceiling Fixture,Light lens had a small crack on one side 1 inch high . Not worth sending back. Everthing else was ok.
1,Not so lucky,I put two of these up and after wiring in the attic for half the day I went to put the bulbs in and this cheesy piece of junk light broke at the pin recepticles on the last light bulb. I have to take it down and throw it in the trash. My suggestion is to go to the local store and get your light.
3,"Jazzy watch, Lacks other features.","If you want to buy me a gift for christmas, don't get me a wristwatch. Not because I don't like wristwatches, I love them. I'm just extremely picky about the right kind of watch. When it comes to watches, I'm a tough customer. Why? A good watch is something that's ALWAYS on your person! A good watch should last 3-5 years on average. Additionally, I want a wrist watch that has a vibrating alarm, chronometer, compass and ideally a temperature gauge as well ALL in analog! That said, this watch is a decent product. I only give it three stars because it lacks the other features I crave for a watch, but for it's solid design and chronometer, it's great. I would have preferred the option of a metal band, but for the price, this is a VERY professional-looking pilot-like watch."
3,needs help,Stem pulled out first time i attempted toset the time. I sent it in for repair buthave heard nothing.
2,Should have been a white paper,"This is one of those business books that shouldn't have made into a book to begin with. There is simply not enough content to fill an entire book so the basic story gets repeated and repeated and... The authors could have said what needed to be said in a two page white paper and be done with it.Additionally, the editor must have been asleep: typos, run-away sentences, and repetitive paragraphs (you read something and then the same paragraph shows up one page later).Not worth the money. The authors should have done expert interviews before publishing a book to understand how to do it..."
3,If you like shooting this is your game,Though an old game it offers plenty of action even for action oriented fans of video games.I was expecting a game more on the line of Max Payne but I was wrong.Dead to Rights is made for a video game council were Max Payne was made for a PC.If you like action and auto aim this is your game.
4,Like finding a gem among stones,"This is a wonderful discovery! Joe is absolutely ""For Real"", with an unpretentious, highly musical set of great blues. I especially love ""Elem"" with its riveting piano work. Joe's own guitar playing is tasteful, sweet, and inspiring. I look forward to more like this."
3,Weakest of the series,"I found this book disappointingly short. Even for a series of general-audience holiday books (as opposed to historical research), this one only skims the surface. I wish it had more rituals, the way MIDSUMMER did. I wish it had more crafts, the way YULE did. I wish it had more spells, the way HALLOWEEN did. The artwork, while nice, seemed to me to be an excuse to fill pages to make it longer.A fun book, but the weakest of the series."
4,"A good help, but missing in some areas","This screen is very usefull to every DM, both with information and hiding those notes. The charts provide very good info and nice DC guide lines. The Combat Planner is also great, but there is one problem. I have 8 players, and there are only 6 slots, but it was easy to create a form /w 8 slots. One thing that has dissapointed me about the whole new edtion though is the more childish display of the game. The pictures are not as good as 2nd ED Screen(I loved that necro summoning skeletons) and the manner of writing is a bit cutesy. But DM Screen is a great resourse to every DM, allowing play to flow smoothly."
3,Not very useful.,"Had it out for one game, but ending up putting it away as I never refered to it. Would have to nice to have XP charts, ability bonus, Quick NPC stat charts, etc."
2,Require software,"Working with a client who purchased this. Found that the product MUST be used with their software, it is not usable out of the box. Twain support appears to require purchasing the software also (did not try). Once you purchase the software, idScan in our case, it works fine."
1,A very bad experience,"I had two professional IT support people work separately on installing and getting this operating (at $60 per hour each). My operating system is XP. Neither was successful. The device is a piece of junk, the software is terrible, and the customer service is non-responsive - you have to fill out an eticket because they won't answer their phone, and after two days there is still no response. I don't think I can find the packing slip - I bought it through Amazon so I probably can't return it in which case I am going to take it down to the town square and publicly smash it to bits with a baseball bat."
3,I do not like it,"I do not like Morgue so much.I really think if you're a new fan, get first other albums, as Egodram or Anti Christ. Morgue isn't so representative to overall Das Ich sound, it is very dark and slow... that's not a bad thing, but i really think it's not the best album of all they have. I really like the EBM sound of Egodram... if you want a more danceable evolution of Egodram, you'll be disappointed with this one. The only highly danceable hit in this one is Erde Ruft. But if you're open minded, you'll enjoy it as I enjoy Morgue... a little bit, until it came annoying.VERY VERY GOOD, but not a super-classic. Get it if you have Anti Christ, Egodram and maybe Re Laborat first OR if you don't like dancey tracks as Erde Ruft or Destillat, but industrial / neo-classical experimentation."
5,Cool tools for light painting,I bought these lights to rig up for light painting experiment and they are perfect for the deal! I hooked them up with some rechargeable 12v batteries and some simple wiring and I was set to fool around with my camera without burning or hurting myself with the light!! Awesome stuff!!!
1,"Waste of time, Awful!!",I received this item and it didn't work at all. I even took it to the local hardware store had them look at it. They said it was busted. Tried to contact seller about it. They never bothered to respond. I am very disappointed I would love to have this product. If not for the great folks here at Amazon Customer service I would have been out all that money. DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!
5,Like Butter,"I love this knife. It's sharp, holds its edge, and the sheep foot design is perfect not only for electrical work but many applications.As a lefty, I love that you can reverse the thumb nub to open it with the left hand. Klein just always seems to get it right."
1,Tsk tsk....,"Shame on Disney Interactive! In less than 18 months the re-release games with very little additions for the same price as the original! No discounts for owners of the original. This is as bad as buying a DVD and a special edition comes out soon after. If this is their new strategy, you might as well wait a year for the next addition! By the way: what's with the skimpy amount of content? There used to be more activities on your CD roms! Orig. title 2 1/2 stars, little value added version: 1 star!"
2,Norton glitches still not fixed,"This product refuses to perform the live update. In fairness to Symantec, the tech support lads have been attentive by email trying to help me solve this problem, but no matter - it still will not update from my Mac. Is it because of the Mac factor? I don't know. But there it is."
3,Short Lived Print head,"Kodak ESP 6150 All-in-One PrinterThis printer was purchased new from Amazon on 8/22/2011The printer worked okay for four months and then the print head gave out and it was impossible to print. Kodak replaced the print head because it was still under the one year warranty but I sure hope I don't have to get a replacement print head every four months, especially after the warranty runs out and I have to pay for a replacement head.================================================Note to review editor.I think I have met your review criteria. If not please let me know specifically where I did not meet the requirements. This is my 2nd try.================================================="
2,WASTES INK,"The 6150 is easy to set up, does a reasonably good job of printing, and seems like a good printer. However, after having the unit in our house, printing less than 3 times a week (on average), we have had to replace both cartridges 2 times in the past 3 months. We do not print books; we normally print maps or recipes from the internet. However, because the printer ""performs a print head cleaning after each print"", it wastes ink. EVERY TIME YOU PRINT. Ultimately, my HP DeskJet printer was cheaper to operate, as the ink cartridges lasted much longer.We really feel jaded by the ""cheap ink"" campaign Kodak is putting on; it's cheap, but your printer eats it a 2x the rate, so really, it is a break-even venture."
1,"I wanted to like this printer, I really did","Well as many others have said, there are just too many issues with this printer to justify the purchase.Cons (you know it's not good if you're starting with the cons):1) Ink, particularly black, does not last long.2) Wifi is sporadic and sometimes when it says it's connected, it still isn't.3) Print quality is average, at best. Several documents came out with smeared black ink.4) Printer head leaks. Not that it leaks ink all over the inside of the printer, but the printer head needs to be cleaned constantly.Pros:1) Ink is cheap. But, if you're having to buy a cartridge after 50 copies, it's not any cheaper in the long run than, say, HP. So, maybe this isn't a Pro afterall :)For now, I've given up on this Kodak and installed a new Canon. Hope that gives better results."
5,"Does soooooooo much, for soooooo little","I have nothing but great things to say about this printer. The print quality is superior to that of previous HP & Lexmarks! I print frequently for work, and have never had a quality issue. I have gone for several months longer on an ink cartridge than other brands, and when i did need to replace, i was surprised at how cheap it was. I couldnt be happier with this purchase & think you will be too. I think setup is idiot proof!!!!"
2,Pronounced dead by Kodak customer service 2.5 years after purchase,"The printer was good, and the cartridges affordable for 2.5 years. Not sure what the normal lifespan for a printer would be. It stopped printing, and I did all the recommended maintenance processes several times. Finally called Kodak customer service and was on the phone about an hour doing the same thing. The final diagnosis the printer needs to be replaced as it won't even perform a print test. The feeder never worked great either, and the scan process took too long. Don't think I will buy this one again."
4,One of the Nicest Printer out there,"Hi All,I just bought this printer with a very low expectation as i was skeptical about how a $10 ink cartridge would print.I like it for a day to day use, so long its been over 2 months I use the printer regularly may be 25 sheets a week. and I really felt how easy is to use this machine. The build quality of the printer is ok.I like the kodak admin console, how easy is it to scan, print and make life easy with the wifi inbuilt.I took a 2 year warranty from office depot and costed around 11 bucks, just 11 bucks and im covered. what could go wrong?I have spent a ton of money to buy cartridges for HP and finally instead of buying HP cartridges for $90 (whole set) I bought this machine for $100 and cannot be more happier with my decision.Yesterday my color cartridge was over and can you believe its only $18 bucks wow...HP costs around 90 bucks."
1,Kodak ESP Office 6150 -- Awful Printer,"My husband persuaded me to give up a wonderful HP printer for the Kodak 6150, which is a piece of junk. The packaging on my Kodak black printer cartridges say that each cartridge will print 425 pages. This is a blantant marketing lie; we kept a log of every page we printed, and the B&W cartridge completely expired at 125 pages of text. The printer makes a lot of noise and takes an abnormally long time to warm up before it will print. It is also fussy about feeding paper and jams more than any printer I have ever owned. I would never-ever buy another Kodak printer, nor would I ever recommend this printer to anyone."
2,Printer Problem,"My email address is genseth@hotmail.com, i just ordered this item just a few weeks ago and already its giving me an error message thats not an actual error....Is this a normal thing for this product? Not pleased with this.I purchase kodak product all the time... This is a first for me."
3,Printer not for ipad,Does not work with ipad and only prints pictures the size of i phone screen. Good printer. Cheap ink and easy setup.
1,After Warranty Expires Error Code and Need to Replace,"Have had this machine for light printing and convenience of fax and scan. Was very happy with it, no big issues. Then an error code appears that there is a printhead carriage jam (3527). There was nothing jamming. Called Kodak got a polite person who was going through the motions. After a few trials, she says that she needs to check further. Comes back and says that the unit needs to be replaced but it's out of warranty. I fully understand the warranty issue. My rating is based on a machine reaching a point where the manufacturer says it needs to be replaced after very light usage. Even though I've had the machine for about 18 months, I've only gone through 3 sets of cartridges. Guess I should have printed more so it would have broken down sooner. The conspiracy side of me wants to say that these machines are ""programed"" for failure. A very similar issue happened with the HP I replaced with this Kodak."
1,POS,"very disappointed..many times (usually at critical times) no matter what I do to persuade it the thing wont scan...and I keep getting a ""failed to scan"" error. No crap you've been starting at the document for several minutes now. I have both ESP7 and ESP 6150 and they have both developed this problem. Very frustrating to spend good money for a multipurpose machine only to fine out it randomly doesn't like functioning in one of the most critical modes when you most need it to. NEXT time I will be making a different choice--sorry Kodak!!!"
1,Kodak ESP 6150 printer--4 mos old and needs new printhead,"Dec 12, 2011: Initially I liked the printer very much (see below)...BUT it is now 4 months old and will not print correctly (missing colors, missing text/numbers, lines across photos etc etc). I have replaced cartridges more than once, and aligned/cleaned printhead more than once. It's no help. Kodak supposedly is ending me a new printhead under warranty in a few days. In meantime, I will be looking at other brands of printer.---Sept 1, 2011: Having been an HP OfficeJet All In One printer user for more than a dozen years, I was somewhat reluctant to leave the HP world and try another brand, but am very glad I did. The Kodak 6150 is easy to set up and use, a bit noisier than the HP but seems just as fast, and print quality is more than acceptable. Am looking forward to the lesser print costs that Consumer Reports found in its recent article. I use the printer with a USB cable, so can't comment on wireless mode."
4,Sofa arm organizer,"This is a great product for holding all your remote controls.I am not disabled, but I do have a hard time getting around having the remotes handy is great.I am constantly asking my hubby where the remote is. he told me one time he was going to hang them from my neck. There are lots of pockets to put items in books Mp3 player note pads pens., anything you can think of.This organizer has put items within reach.Shipping was fast. I truely enjoy it!!"
4,Comfortable and does the job!,"It is a little small for a normal sofa arm, but either way it will work if it doesn't fit. Pockets are of decent size and will fit any normal remote control. The center area was a surprise, it looks rather insecure, but does the job and works for drinks as well. I have placed big cups in it and will hold good enough. It is very light so you can move it around with one hand. I would have prefer a different color than solid blue, but i don't really care too much. Low price also."
5,Good Work!,"I found this book to be extremely useful in several ways, especially in helping me get accquainted with the Internet and Windows Explorer. The book was clearly written, making it interesting to read and easy to use. I would definitely be interested in more of his books."
2,"Traditional Knitting Patterns from Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, Italy",I wouldn't recommend this book.
1,It is a shame!,"It is 0 star, but there is no such rating.The CD is completely different from what is still advertised.The cover is different, the songs are totally different. It is NOT the CD I ordered.Unless you want the sound of a rowdy crowd, don't buy it!"
1,THIS IS NOT THE CD THAT IS ADVERTISED,This is not the CD that is advertised. The cover is different and songs are different and this is the second CD that I have orderd that was not what it was advertised to be. A complete waste of money. Not to mention that I ordered a book from here and they took the money out of my account but I still have not recieved it.The website makes me rate it at lease 1 star but I won't even give it that. I rate it a big fat ZERO!M.Campbell
5,Excellent,"This is an example Martial arts in its highest form. The sheer power and technical excellence that Shinyu Gushi and his assistants demonstrate is awe-inspiring. Instructon that will last a traditional student a very long time. The same could be said of his second video ""Primary Techniques and Kata""..."
2,Camera work is the problem.,While the aerobic moves are challenging - especially for a beginner - the moves aren't the problem. It's the camera work. The camera is constantly changing from full view to close up of the instructors' faces. And since the moves are constantly changing it's hard to keep up because the viewer can't see their legs. This video would have had a much higher rating from me if I could have been able to keep my eyes on their legs to see the move changes.
1,A poorly written book,"The topic of the book is one that needs to be addressed, but this book doesn't do it justice or provide a solution to the problem. It seems to be more about airing personal laundry, in a poorly written manner, mainly through lists that are not all that humurous. Turner considers himself an outsider when he might better be considered an insider that's had a bad experience or no experience at all. Someone needs to write a better book to handle this subject properly and show this one up."
4,southren italys best,I think this is one of the best collection of italian music this bring old world charm to all people.
2,A drag,"Anyone who's read my reviews of the Delorme Street Atlas books will know I'm a great admirer of good mapping and of Delorme as a mapping company. I've used the early versions of Street Atlas USA for more than a decade, going back to the 1.0 version and bragged about them to friends. I'm sorry to see this great company falling short with their software, gradually declining in their usefulness and usability. The amount of detail for the remote areas on the more recent software releases is receding, the software is becoming too complex to use, and I'm to the point of only recommending Delorme in paper. And awfully sorry to have to say it. I'd offer the opinion that Delorme needs to back up a few paces and rediscover the needs of their loyal buyers."
2,Can't recommend it.,"Like many others, I've used older versions of this program for years. This version is poor. Five to twelve minutes to load on a Pentium 4, 2.6GHz w/512MB RAM is too much. I also purchased the Handheld version. What a ripoff!! I only need the device drivers but can't get them without purchasing the Handheld software. Even attempting to use that version alone, by installing the data files rather than running from CD results in the program not being able to find the data files. The data files, incidentally, are exactly the same as the standard version but it can't find those either. Not an improved program in my estimation, but a rather poor update. Tech support is useless as they don't even respond to email. They've done such a great job of hiding their phone numbers on their web site that I've given up trying to find one. Would be a long distance call anyway, they dont' have 800 numbers to the best of my knowledge.Unhappy DeLorme customer."
3,"Spectacular set and costume, grand sound.","Oh my god, the Russians definitely know how to put up an amazing ballet in such a spectacular scale.The set, costume, and music are absolutely amazing.From time to time the stage was ""crowded"" with so many talented dancers. I do agree that Svetlana does look a little too mature, she dances all right, but somehow lacks the magic and passion.The DTS-HD Master Audio is professionally recorded, with great detail and impressive dynamic range. Please do yourself a favor, watch this performance with a good sound system.The dancers are doing a great job, nothing spectacular on the technical side, it's understandable as Sleeping beauty ballet is not mean to show off those kind of skills."
2,It really gave me a scare!,"First off, it requires the removal of your existing anti-virus if you want to install the Panda anti-virus. I reluctantly removed Norton AV-2004 to try Panda. But, the real fun began when I had the utilities do a few things like defragment, which caused a complete lock-up of the system when the screen saver lighted up. Then, when doing a complete system scan using Panda, there was the same problem once again. It just wasn't worth the trouble. But the excitement began when I tried to reinstall Norton. Something wasn't right, and it took about an hour to figure out. IMHO, it just isn't worth it - too many bugs!"
3,It's OK.,"I was really looking forward to tasting this coffee. I generally buy a costa rican blend, but it was unavailable when I ordered this. The Pura Vida is Ok for everyday drinking, but, it's not great. I guess I've been spoiled."
4,First Book of Modern Lace Knitting,"the book met my expectations, but not my hopes -- i was hoping for more variety in patterns. nevertheless, i am grateful for the information it contains. it will assist me in tackling the difficult sport of lace knitting ;-)"
5,Great book!,"This book was great. Though the reading level wasn't difficult, (it wasn't intended to be), I still found it entertaining, and yes, even suspensful. I couldn't put it down, and I very nearly started crying at Obi-Wan's nickname, ""Oafy-Wan."" BUY THIS BOOK! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
2,Something is missing here...,"I ordered the product expecting 2 discs: the new movie with Ferrel and Kidman but also a disc with a few of the original episodes we love so much. However, when it arrived there was only the movie. No second disc was to be found. I contacted the seller and explained the problem. They sent a replacement product and yet again, no Sampler Disc."
2,Not What I expected,After reading the reviews I thought for sure I would like this DVD. I did not. I am new to yoga and I found this to be a little to challenging for me. He has you hold the poses for so long and my arms just couldn't do it. Then some of the moves I couldn't get my body in that position. I felt he could have given better instructions or tell you what to do when you couldn't do a pose. Also I don't see where this helps you with anxiety and depression. I thought the instructor would tell you how to address those issue thru you yoga practice. He only said a few words about it in the beginning before you started the practice.
5,Excellent and empowering,"A terrific practice that reconnects us with the wisdom of our own bodies, and recalibrates us to our natural state of happiness, balance, and physical and mental health."
5,Rave reviews for Yoga for Depression & Anxiety,"I love this DVD for a number of reasons...I'll list them tho they are not prioritized.1. The timing and flow is very real.2. The piece is shot in such a way that the viewer is motivated to practice along, I feel, because the principals in the video look like real people, not super models or overly flexible Yoginis. The positions are described clearly and calmly. I became involved with the video because it feels human.3. The positions are not too demanding on the practitioner.4. The approach on many levels is perfectly tangible.I feel the concept of yoga fighting depression and anxiety can work and of all the yoga videos out there, this one delivers benefits immediately and with long term goals.You feel that a message to help is being transmitted and shared here.Sincerely,Me,D."
3,Just Okay,"It's okay, I prefer a nicer setting. I felt it helped with depression and overall needed stretching, a little advanced for me since I am a beginner but I was able to adjust. Transaction was great though! Thanks!"
5,Excellent teachings,"I took Ira's workshop and found him to be exceedingly knowledgeable about psychology, consciousness, and yoga. I recommend his work."
1,Low quality yoga DVD,"Waste of money. I bought this DVD after all the positive reviews I read. What a disapointment! Low quality recording and sound. The instructor' assistant is wearing wide-leg pants with red color which makes it very hard to follow the leg moves and red acts like a cloth for the bull. The annoying, repetitive words of background music do not allow you to relax your mind. Would like to return it, but can't."
2,Soapy,"I was disappointed in this novel; I found it full of stock villains and too-perfect protagonists. Too many things happen at ""just the precise moment"" for them to be anywhere near believable. Too schlocky for my tastes."
2,RIVER GOD,I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED WILBUR SMITHS BOOKS AS A GREAT HOLIDAY READ BUT THIS WAS SO OVER EXPLAINED AND UNBELEIVABLE AS TO BE PAINFUL TO READ.I REALISE THIS WAS TO TEMPT US INTO BELEIVING THAT MYTH MIGHT BE TRUTH BUT THE STORY LINE WAS SO LABOURED IT LOST MY INTEREST.
5,the seventh scroll,The sequel to River God is even better than the original. The novel keeps a steady riveting rhythm and rich character with out the slower start of River God. I recommend reading the two books in conjunction to really appreciate the ancient Egyptian Protagonist. This is a rousing novel that begs to be made into a film.
3,Not for the Squeamish or Prudish Reader,"Wilbur Smith's very well written novel is about 600 pages long in paperback form. His description in the latter chapters of the war with the Hyksos (Shepherd kings) is excellent. In the first few chapters, Taita the devoted, beautiful, man-slave of Queen Lostris, describes in detail how he was castrated (& more), plus Smith's continual references to homosexuality throughout the book If you are knowledgeable in egyptology, some parts are silly and unbelievable. A ""Taita"" stand? I'm still laughing at this one. and ""Taita"" spoon? Worthwhile reading."
5,Smith tells a great story,"Smith was genious to bring to life the everyday struggle of ancient egypt. I am not sure if he was trying to parallel any actual people, but his vivid descriptions of the gods and lifestyle of the time was wonderful. This book is very entertaining, hard to put down."
2,"""A slow moving river.""",The first person novel is a bit verbose and slow moving. Many facts helped me enjoy the story since I have been to Egypt several times.
2,disapointed in Wilbur Smith,River God in the Egyptian series is a real disappointment. I'm a real fan of the Courtney series but this is just gory and boring
3,"Story is ok, but actual book falling apart","The story line of this book is ok, but the author does go into very long elaborations of details (which I am not crazy about). The book itself, however, is falling apart. As you turn the page, it falls out of the book."
5,A totally compelling read... :),"Simply amazing. The history is, however, put off. The background info at the end was shocking! Simply, it was giving me goosebumps! OI! I must say you should read this definatly!"
2,Disappointing.,"Taita the super slave. Content to be a slave and refuses freedom. Taita; scribe,architech, doctor, lawyer,microbiologist,surgeon, overseer, inventor, prophet, businessman, poet, orator,spy,chaperone, advisor to pharoh, military strategist. Please...enough. The lead characters are too perfect and the people too gullible. The flouting of adultery at the highest level is an insult to a proud people. This book should be seen as a modern day soap opera and nothing else."
5,RIVER GOD - WILBUR SMITH,"River God is proboably THE best book I've ever read. Taita, Tanus, Lostris were all vividly portrayed, which captured my attention.Wilbur Smith's interpretation of the scrolls captured my interest and full attention - I was not able to put it down untill I had read the entire book. It is through the characters and place settings that I felt 'at home' with the characters, which was topped off with the magnificent setting of Egypt.Through Taita's calm and precise portrayal of the life and times I fell in love with Egypt, of which I just keep going back!Dave:)"
2,Griffin 9329 leather case for iPod Video,The iPod fits snuggly in the case but I was disappointed to find that the device has to be removed when using a player. I have two different players and found that the case is too bulky to fit into either player.
3,Could be better.,"I bought this case for the following reasons: 1) Does not leave the screen exposed; 2) cover flips open downward and out of the way; 3) looks good.Unfortunately, the magnets that hold the cover closed are (must be) quite weak. Because of this, the cover flips open many times when I brush against things, and dangles there until I notice it and close it. As a result, this case doesn't protect the screen as much as I would like it to.A final issue: yesterday, the belt clip broke, after about four months of service. I'm hoping that I can find a replacement.In summary, I like this case in principle, but in actual use, it hasn't quite met my expectations."

1,good book stolen from a library,"Love the book; however, it comes from a public library!!!!! What's up with this? A book 'stolen' from a library and then resold for $10+??"
3,"it's OK for casual use, a bit light","I got this for my wife as an anniversary gift. It was the appropriate metal for the occasion, and since we have a tendency to break glasses and goblets, I thought it was a good choice. My wife uses it regularly and seems pleased with it for ""everyday use"".That doesn't mean it's not without flaw. The goblet is somewhat small, so it requires more-frequent re-filling. It's also very light -- the metal is not heavy-weight or thick, so it actually feels fragile. The stem seems solid, and I have no fear of it breaking...so far.On the plus side, it cleans-up very easily and isn't subject to staining. The satin finish is great for this. Since it's stainless steel, it doesn't retain any spots or markings and wipes clean with a sponge and warm water. In other words, great for everyday use."
5,Out of the Past,"Over the years, I've worn a lot of colognes, but nothing suits me like White Shoulders. For many years I have chosen it as my ""signature"" cologne. However, it is getting harder and harder to find in stores. Thank goodness for Amazon Online. The delivery is quick, the price is right, and I can still spray on this beautiful scent that speaks to who I am and gives me and others pleasure every time I wear it. Thanks for making it possible to find this lovely cologne today. I still get many compliments when I wear White Shoulders, both from men and women. I love the convenience and reliability of shopping at Amazon."
5,Archos MP3 player,"The product is great, my daughter loves it! The mail order service was quick And packaged well."
3,Can't complain (much),"""SHUR-LINE"" ""PRO-CAGE"" etc. I thought, wow, a decent roller frame at a cheap price point. Nope, just go to the big orange store around the corner and grab their cheapest roller and you'll do as well as this. You know, the ones that come in boxes of 50 or whatever. This thing doesn't hold covers well. It wobbles too much. It doesn't turn smoothly. For ten bucks you can buy aconsumer-level Purdy rolleron Amazon with a wood handle that doesn't slide around as much in your hand. Pass up this roller. Three stars because it did the job, but you get what you pay for. In fairness, I believe my expectations were too high because a brand name was attached."
2,Better Greek music cds available,"There are much cleaner, crisper, better-performed and more authentic Greek music cds out there-- keep looking. This seems to be an effort to ""westernize"" or ""homogenize"" this style of music. The arrangements were strange to say the least-- odd choruses remenicent of Montovani singers, for example. The use of timpani drums as background to the Zorba dance, among other tracks. Lots of music: 20 tracks -- but sometimes more is not better."
4,For children and us older kids alike,"As you would expect from Philip Pullman, 'Clockwork' is a skillfully written book with more depth than might be apparent to the younger reader. The events and characters fit together as neatly as the teeth of the clockwork Pullman describes, and the illustrations and textual 'asides' are delightful, offering complementary and contrasting views of the action as it progresses. It is a book which has an enormous amount to offer readers of all ages and is gripping enough to keep you turning those pages.A post-modern version of Grimms Fairy Tales, 'Clockwork' has a certain gothic horror element to it, whilst retaining an underlying 'adult amusement' value. Pullman effectively combines the two, eliciting fear one moment and laughter the next. All the characters are well crafted but Dr Kalmenius is clearly the best, scoring 10 out of 10 on the villainy scale.CLOCKWORK: OR ALL WOUND UP is an example of 'children's' fiction at its very best."
1,Disk 2 was missing,Bought the entire series for my wife as an anniversary present. Disk 2 of Season 2 was missing. To avoid an elongated back and forth debacle we let it slide. Until we git an email to review the product.
1,One page of information in a 31 page booklet!,"Very limited information about anything. Reads more like a newspaper article. If the author knows anything about flea-markets, she has kept it a secret."
3,So-so attempt,I am a huge fan of Possessed since '85 and was looking forward to this updated interpretation of these timeless classics but nothing beats the originals!
5,Fate is the Hunter should be mandatory reading for all pilots,"Fate is the Hunter is a terrific book for pilots wanting to know how to incorporate what they have learned into actual flying. It is an exciting recount of situations in which you hope to never find yourself. It happens, and the reader can feel the anxiety and apprehension of dealing with the results of decisions made before, during and after flight.Non-pilots will enjoy Gann's prose and writing style."
5,The measure of a man...,"Everyone here has given this book five stars and I am no exception. Pilots know that flying is not just transportation but a way of learning who you really are, the stuff you are made of. This book is clearly Gann's masterwork. After reading the chapter on thunderstorms, I thought that there was just no better aviation writing and I still had half the book to go. Of course, then came the chapter on flying in ice. This alone is worth the price of the book and is probably the best aviation story every told. My hair stood on end for days... A great blend of flying, adventure and good writing."
1,Troubles right away,"After less than three months it is dead, and I wasn't happy from the start. The documentation was poor. The power supply plug didn't fit well, and wouldn't seat properly. The 'power port' that was supposed to serve as a non-USB source of power wouldn't charge my iPod. Now yesterday it stopped working completely, so I'll throw it away and try another type."
3,"not screamo, nor hardcore, still decent","a lot of people will find room to insult fashioncore bands like ASL under the pretense that it's trendy. sure, it's trendy and cliche, but this music is entertaining to a point. nothing original here, but that's not to say it can't be enjoyable. as much as I hate kids calling this stuff emo/screamo or hardcore (to which this cd is not a part of), it's a decent introduction to the music as a whole."
1,Old Fast,This Cd is not nearly as good as the band's pre-signed stuff. I know that it's been getting pretty good reviews but you may want to give this one a listen before adding it to your library of music.
5,AMAZING!,wowww...i was never a fan of any type of emo-core until now. there isnt a single song on this cd that isnt amazing. the guitars are great and the lyrics are powerful. if u havent already i suggest u buy this cd right away!
4,Another chapter written in post-hardcore,"Static Lullaby Blew me right out of the water when i gave ""Don't Forget to Breathe"" a listen for the first time. I had downloaded the album in mp3 becuase i had never heard of them and wanted to find some new hardcore. I was not expecting the fury and melody this album had to offer. I then imediatly went out and purchased this album(Mp3 sharing benifits everybody). This is a step above thursday, Posion the Well and Grade. If You want something genuine then cop this album and support great underground music."
2,A little scary but not much of a movie,Not much to say about this one except it just kind of droaned on and didn't offer much. It had a few scary spots but the scenes seemed repeated within the movie. It seems like many of Jennifer Connelly's movies show her as depressed and try to have us feel sorry for her. She's one of my favs but that does seem to be the case. I was just disappointed with this movie.
1,stupid,I bought this movie on the release date because I really wanted to watch it and the video store was obviously closed. Off I went to sear's with my money. Worst mistake i'll ever make. It started out strong but by the middle you were slipping into a comatose state. Borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring.
2,how scary can pg-13 be?!?!?!?!?,"scary,creepy,eerie,oh my!but in the end,nothing.........just another''close up of petrified woman.....cue noise......jerk camera...........now scream!''the whole single parent with the 1 kid in a haunted place is so blase and predictable that the pg-13 makes it even worse.and yes,an ''unrated-lets fleece the audience for even more money version in BOTH wide and full screen''(sold seperately of course).why do people bother going to pg-13 snorefests when the better version will be for sale/rent a few months later?!?!?!?OBVIOUSLY,pg-13 is NOT the version the director wanted us to see,so why do we?!?!?!?!?DUH!!!women and children thats why!!!!!!!!!and us guys have to sulk and put up with it.guys,BE HONEST!"
3,Eh,"I'm not a fan of the scary movies. Especially after I watched The Ring. Of course my ""crazy"" mind still wants to see the freaky flicks because for some ODD reason, I like the thought of being so afraid that I pee my pants...well not literally. Maybe you should ignore that! ;) lolYeah the movie was scary but all of the spooks where benign. I may watch it again with a different point of view but I doubt that. My two sisters went with me to watch it in the theater and they were both just laughing because they thought this was ridiculous! Remember though they're fans of The Grudge, The Ring...and all of those kooky horrors. Why can't they make a old-fashioned horror flick? Yeah it's fun to see different renditions of scary. But my heart resides to the Ghosty mystery stuff that NEVER gets old. I am looking forward to the Skelelton Key. We'll see how that turns out! :)"
2,DARK WATER,It was OK. But I would not consider it a quality horror movie. The writing could have been better - I could guess the story too soon into the movie. I will probably not watch this movie again. I gave my copy away. Maybe someonelse will enjoy it.
1,More Asian productions remake???,"I feel like Hollywood has ran out of ideas and decided to chopped up perfectly good Horror productions from Asia. The Ring, for example, perfectly chopped up the feeling of horror it gave us from the original version 'Ringu'.Perhaps it's culture and we get our boogieman to scare us in our own terms and ways, but really, horror for alternate sides are not meant for remakes for the other, unless you do it right. Otherwise, any remake of a good horror would just led to audiences to just blink and stare in the end, asking, ""What and why am I watching this?""I'm still expecting a good remake to enter Hollywood screen. Bollywood can make it, so show me an advance leader in the entertainment business can do it better."
3,don't watch this yet!!!,"trust me on this, i have owned a copy of the original japanese version of this film for years. it is one of the creepiest films i've seen in a long time. there were a couple key moments that totally destroyed me and wouldn't you know it, those are the scenes they changed for the american remake. my personal opinion is that the american version of ""the ring"" was superior to the original japanese version, but if you're going to watch this movie, and don't mind reading subtitles, go with the japanese version."
1,My roommate owes me 3.95,"She ordered this from On Demand and we attempted to watch it one night. I fell asleep due to extreme boredom and a comfortable corner on a bed. I woke up at the very end when the girl's father took her out of the apartment.And what's funnier. I slept thru the whole thing, my roomie watched it and when I woke up, we both had the same level of confusion. Go figure."
4,"Romance, Mystery and adventure!",Great book. Loved the fact that Ada Steward has taken the time to write about the Rodeo clown and give a tribute to the great job he does. This book was filled with sexual desire from the first chapter and keeps it going through the book. The story of her adopted son is great and keeps you glued to the book to the end. The Long time love of the two is inspiring making you think back to that first love you had back at 14. The age diffrence of the two never matters in fact it adds to the sexual Power of the book. A wonderfull read!
1,jane eyre,The video is in bad shape. I want my money back. Is this how you'll work. And for the movie bleak house region 2.
5,classic,bleak house remains a wonderful social commentary--powerfully cynical with a string of hope binding all of the characters together. this bbc production is among the finest of its kind.
4,Dickens is a genius with characters,Well acted and very well produced to the period. Very enjoyable.. It was cool to see Jillian Anderson in a different role from X-Files.
3,Good watch.,"After watching Downton Abbey, this show just didn't measure up. It was still a good watch but there are other BBC shows that are a great watch."
3,"Great pans, bad packaging for shipping.","Pans arrived in a somewhat large box for such a small package. The pans were shrink-wrapped together nicely, but they were loose in the larger outer box. The largest pan was slightly bent in one area, but it appeared to not have made it unusable. A smaller shipping box and some air cushion or peanuts would solve that problem. They are very nice heavy duty pans."
3,"A beautiful book, badly in need of an editor","This is a beautiful book showing the evolution of Apple's industrial design. Apple is the only company whose industrial design is worth such a book. The history is interesting, and it's fascinating to see how designs evolve.There are two problems with this book which caused me to give it only 3 stars. The first is that it desperately needs a copy editor. The spelling and grammar errors would be unacceptable from a college freshman. Several times, a reference to a picture gives the wrong plate number. I expect much better from a book on excellent design.A minor gripe is that it's not clear who the intended audience is. Some technical terms are defined (though for the lay audience it would help to have a couple of pictures to illustrate terms), but many are not. As a lay reader, there were ideas I just didn't get, even as I appreciated the beauty of the work they described.If these two problems were fixed, I would give it 5 stars."
5,"Worth the money, period.","I'm an avide fan of Apple Computer and it's history. If you love Sony and other excellent industrial design, then you'll love this book. I've only read small portions, but the pictures and history are excellent.David Greelishclassiccomputing dot com"
4,history and culture of the Eskimo,"Very interesting to compare this explorer's observations with modern anthropological studies. Chapters include: Trading with the Eskimo, Love and Marriage, Polar justice, Eskimos as Servants, Matter ans Spirit, Music and Poetry, plus many short histories and family anecdotes. 441 pages, about 18 illustrations."
2,Be aware that this product contains corn gluten meal,"Please note that Friskies reformulated the ingredients for this cat treat. The Friskies chicken treat was my cat's favorite treat by far, but she is allergic to corn. Now that they've gone the cheap route and started adding corn gluten meal as a filler, I can no longer feed these to my pet.Ingredient list from: [...]:Animal liver flavor, wheat flour, corn gluten meal, chicken by-product meal, water, wheat gluten, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), glycerin, gelatin, calcium sulfate, phosphoric acid, soy protein isolate, salt, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, added color, potassium phosphate, sorbic acid (a preservative), citrus fiber, seafood flavor, propionic acid (a preservative), fish oil, ethoxyquin (a preservative), cheese flavor. E-5365"
1,Low readability in a number of passages,"When I ordered this book, I was not informed of the production process. At the reception of the book I read ""How We Made This Book"" on page IV. I quote: ""We automated the typing, proof reading and design of this book using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software on a scanned copy of the original rare book. That allowed us to keep the cost as low as possible.""Nice. If I had known this before I whouldn't have bought it, for I had already worked with OCR and found out that you often get some odd results as OCR frequently does not recognize characters and vomits parts of sentences in some not yet discovered language. For example: ""wittTfijeacHaL"", or: ""Jf Jhev will notgCL-thfij are shot down, theijJeiUiandsbeing cut off"". That's what the reader of this book is confronted with. Okay, not on every page, but too often for me to enjoy reading it."
1,Stop the madness!,"I just don't get the hoopla about MOS. I personally have to change the station every time they come on. It's like listening to dying cats mewing in a back alley. Godawful. I had to click on Amazon to see what people were saying about them... and so of course, had to add my own two cents. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$ ON THIS!"
1,Lame..,"There is NOTHING charming or infectious about this album. Dull, hookless, twee, indie rock. And this couple lacks chemistry."
5,Simply...,I'm amazed at the complexity of the sound that is created by these two. Their music carries such a great attitude and atmosphere. Such characteristic sound is rarely found in even the tightest five-pieces.
2,Time to Run,Do not purchase if you are looking for a believable and interesting story line about navy seals and romance.
5,Very informative,This DVD on how to knit was very informative and easy. I hosted a knitting party for some friends and myself to learn how to knit and with this dvd we were able to catch on and learn quickly. The dvd moved at just the right pace and allowed you to easily pause and repeat steps if needed. The explanations were good and detailed. I would recommend this DVD to anyone that wants to learn how to knit. I've been knitting for a few days and I already feel like a professional and could teach others. :)
5,A must for the novice !,"I'm a novice taking a knitting class. The class was not very helpful and I was about to give up till I bought this DVD and after watching each section of the dvd once I was knitting,! I was even able to teach my classmate. This is a MUST for anyone getting started. Neci is GREAT teacher,I wish she could come to my house! Can't wait for more from her. I now love to knit!!!!!"
5,Excellent,"I found this dvd to be an excellent way to learn to knit. The instructions were clear and concise and easy to follow. Any time I had a question, it was quickly answered by the video, Ms. McNally anticipated the problems a beginner would have. I really think it would make a perfect gift because it is so simple to use and easy to learn from. I do not have a lot of hand skills, but it didn't matter when I followed the directions on this video. A great job!"
5,"Perfect Casting, Perfect Direction, Perfect Acting...","...I am flipped for road moovys and this is one of my faves. I get the feel that Hollywood doesn't know how to treat the fabuloso Melanie Griffith, but her range comes out nicely in this. (She has almost been placed in a Marilyn Monroe typecasting thing, but with this and a few of those lesser known Mela G. moovys, time is gonna show how great she really is.) And, boy! Wouldn't that be a trip to have evvybody's smarmy nightmare, Ray Liotta, as the (ex)boyfriend of some girl you've fallen for? Anyway, this is a good product that I don't mind watching over and over again."
1,Poor Picture Quality Because It Was Recorded in LP to Save $,"Imagine my surprise as the tape started, and lo and behold all these pasty, smeary colors on the screen, a sure indication of a less-than-SP recording speed! Upon checking, I discover it's being played at the 4-hour speed (LP). This is sometimes done in order to get a longer movie on a shorter cassette to save manufacturing costs. It's not always indicated on the box.I was disappointed at this, for the price I paid. Movies at Wal-Mart for cheaper might be that way; at least I'm not surprised then. But I was with this purchase."
5,High Def,"I remember seeing this waaaay back when it was in theaters. One of those incredibly under-rated cinematic gems. What I liked most about it was the transition from a seemingly lighthearted Indie-ish goofball romantic comedy, to dead on noir. I caught this recently on a High-Def channel on cable. All I can say is WOW ! It was like I was seeing it for the first time, Déjà vu all over again. This film deserves a Blu-ray release, preferably packed with extra features, commentaries etc."
4,Ok,"My only problem with this watch is as another reviewer stated:The Timex Logo on the watch dial is distracting due to its size and the fact that it is on the face of the watch. I considered sending it back because of this one glaring problem. But the distraction does fade as you get used to the watch.Otherwise, it's a terrific timepiece. Keeps accurate time, the dial is bright, and the ""night light"" is superb.I'm keeping it, but it was touch and go the first few days..."
5,A must for any new Texas Gardner,"I am new to Texas as well as gardening. This book is a great reference as well as a great book to spark new ideas. I place this publication in the ""must have"" catagory for any Texas gardner that wishes to succeed."
3,A Book Lacking In Content,"I found this book somewhat disappointing. It lacked content, and neglected a lot of the WHYs in a blended family. I left this book feeling unfulfilled. However, _Keys to Successful Step-Mothering_ does contain some good content on coping skills and would be a good read for the busy mom or stepmother. This book is a good companion to other, more in depth, step parenting books, but I found it doesn't stand well on its own."
1,An interesting discovery of cycle analysis,"In purchasing Delta, I thought that I was going to be able make a lot of money in the stock market since the ups and downs are already locked in. The only way you're likely to make any sort of money from this is in long term commodity futures. Even then, you're still not guaranteed success. I've given this book one star based on the fact that fundamentally Delta is utterly useless when it comes to accurate buying and selling."
1,Over-hyped!,"Terrible, terrible, terrible! Grant Morrison is of the school of thought that the more you shock your audience, the better. That could be a sound strategy were it not for the fact that somewhere in there, you need a good story, which this isn't. Yes, Arkham Asylum is full of stark-raving lunatics who hate not only Batman, but just about everyone else. But the madness in this story doesn't feel like it's there for the purpose of advancing the plot or explaining things to the reader. In Morrison's hands it just feels gratuitious. And the art is bad... I can understand going a little outside the norm to get the point across. But call me crazy, I actually like to SEE what is going on. Imagine a movie set being lit by a 40-watt bulb, and you'll get a good idea of what you're in store for when you pick up this item..."
1,same old same old,"This story jumps frequently from the journals of Arkhams founder back to the main story, the transitions are not done smoothly, which makes the storytelling awkward.The basic theme: the criminals in Arkham are insane, Batman is insane, and therefore the criminals and Batman are one and the same, and can only rely upon fate and madness to get out of the asylum, where they have all become trapped. You get to watch Batman hallucinate, stabs himself, whimper for his mother, and has a non-reaction when the Joker blows a guards head off. Come on, I've had enough of the ""hero is the same as the baddies"" stuff, let the heroes be heros.The typography is bad, especially for the Joker, who speaks in large red letters which are nearly unreadable...kind of like this graphic novel."
1,looney toons...or just an excuse for sloppy work,"Hey, let's write about the criminally insane. Then let's use that same theme for the plot and artwork in a graphic novel. Splash in some perverted violence just to show how evil these guys are. For a horror type comic, I recommend Sandman instead."
3,Gem Identifications,"This is a very small pocket size book, maybe 3""x4"". It is a good book to carry with you when you go shopping for gemstones but with it being so small I don't like it. It is a very detailed book and a color for each precious gemstone but not enough information as the other books I reviewed. I think if they enlarged the book it would be easier to use. For a beginner I don't recommend this book for now but can be added to your reference library later."
2,A long-time Hoover user...disappointed.,"Cleans great, vacuums up the water poorly! After I was done cleaning my carpet, it was still very wet. I did follow the instructions- going over the damp carpet several times, but it still left it very wet. I pulled out my 10 year old Hoover (which still vacuums well, but the brushes stopped working), and went over the carpet, only using the vacuuming function; when I was done, it vacuumed up over a gallon of water- left in my carpet by the new Agility! I returned the Agility the next day. Still searching for a replacement of my old half-working Hoover."
2,Steamvac agility,"this is my second steamvac and I'm very dissapointed. Not only does is the suction lacking as other reviewers have mentioned, but after less than a couple dozen uses an interior hose split making the vacuum inoperable. I've seen several other postings where folks have had the same problem."
3,Decent,"It would probably help alot if there was a book that came with it. DOUBLE CHECK if you like a ONLY VIDEO TUTORIAL. The details of the video was kinda like most other reviews saying that it was more of a show you what is done process instead of how to do it and why.Also, there needs to be alot of editing done on the videos to cut down the tedious process and get straight to the point of problem areas...etc. The clicking sound of the mouse was kind of annoying too. For a item at this price you would think they'd take a little more care in creating it.With all said, I'd give it a 3 stars."
4,A Great Book For Girls Ages 8-10,"Girl Reporter #4 by Linda Ellerbee was an exciting book,something unexpected happened in practically every chapter. Casey andall the other characters seemed so real it felt as if the whole story was going on right in front of me. Out of all the Get Real books, I personally liked this one the best!"
3,A good album,"A great America Classic album from 1977; I personally own all America's music and this album is definitely worth listening to however it is far from being their best. So buy it only if you are a hardcore America fan, otherwise try Hat Trick or America instead."
5,Nothing Is Better,"The greatest rock album EVER. If this doesn't change your life, it's not worth changing. Kill yourself now."
1,A bunch of random nonsense.,"Nothing but nothing. I don't know how they managed to cram so little onto a cd - there is literally no music here whatsoever. You think that the first track is starting out with some arty studio sounds or random tuning or something, but the whole album sounds like that. If your favorite part of classical music concerts is when everyone is tuning up at the same time before the show, then by all means, pick this up. Otherwise, don't waste your time. This is just a bunch of random nonsense."
3,Simmering slop,"3 1/2Highly influential anti-traditional release of hellbilly psychedelia is like short-length Kraut rock from some Louisiana back alley. With an overtly offbeat delivery, shrill guitar attacks, and druggy stream-of-consciousness approach the eighty minute endeavor can wear thin all at once, but picked apart there are still a surprising amount of ditties on display that dazzle."
1,Is this legal?,"I don't mean to make trouble, but I'm not sure it is legal to use my Aunt Jody's photo for this album cover. I mean, sure, she looks totally different now that the operation was a success. In fact, she looks so good, they are modeling heroic action figures on her new face and body!Accoutrements Crazy Cat Lady Action FigureBut maybe she should be getting royalties for this? Who should I contact?"
1,They should pay us to listen to this.,"An unbelievably stupid album - stupid to the point of fatuousness. All of the pretense of extreme detail and complication only serve to show how little is really here. This is nothing - not music, not art, not interesting, not novel, and most of all not important. A total waste of time and energy."
5,THE MOST INCREDIBLE RECORD EVER MADE!!!!,"I've read reviews of this -- long, wordy -- people trying to EXPLAIN this work of art. Well I'm sorry but that's just stupid. Just listen."
3,What a disappointing album.,"RIP: January 15, 1941 - December 17, 2010).I picked up this CD today with high expectations because it was rated so highly at All Music's site (5 star AMG Album Pick!).I only managed to get one 5 star song off it:Ella Guru - Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band - 1970 - ""AMG Pick. One of his more 'accessible' songs with 3-cord Garage Rock guitar riffs and notable vocals. It almost has a Jazzy feeling at times."" - Trout Mask Replica (Reprise)-1989.BOTTOM LINE: This album is definitely an acquired taste, and I'm giving it a 3 star rating (total stars IMHO divided by 28 tracks).My advice is to get his debut album 'Safe As Milk'-1967 instead where I got most of my 5 star rated songs.Safe As Milk"
1,Tedious Wankery!,"This album was made by a bunch of fake hippies, tootling on instruments they don't know how to play (or don't have the limbs to play, as with the two saxophones at once business), pretending to be ultra-crazy and avant-garde, and laughing all the way to the bank. An album for chumps who want to pretend that they're crazier than everyone else. Guess what, mates? You can keep it. Listen to this a million times if you want, it won't make you anything more than a buffoon with bad music playing on your stereo."
2,Masterpiece or Not?,"This album is widely hailed as one of the most visionary works of all time. I have listened to it several times and just can't seem to grasp it. There seems to be a total lack of melody or even structure in the song writing. Combine that with the Captain's animal like growling vocals and the strangest guitar work I have ever heard, flat and monotone like. What's it all mean? Was this the beginning of punk? I hesitate to call it trash. There is some imagination in it and for that I gave it 2 stars. Maybe with the help of a certain herb it might become clearer; but I don't think there is enough of that on the whole planet to clarify this piece of obscurity."
1,1 star because this album is number 1,blistering. daring. explosive. this is a large stride in the history of music. an excellent example of vision and creativity. kudos to b-fart for pushing the envelope and giving the world this work of incredible value.
1,Here it is:,"I read a 5-star review of this album that said ""it will change how you listen to music,"" and I have to say that I agree wholeheartedly. This is so absolutely terrible that truly beautiful music seems heavenly by contrast. Even marginal music seems better. If you got some bad music for christmas, or like different music than your significant other, throw this stinker on first - everything afterwards sounds relatively good!Enough."
5,A squid eating dough inside a polyethylene bag...,"Oh, buy this, buy this, if only for the grossly and immediately evident delight of ""The Blimp"" which 13 years after first hearing it never fails to cause me to revert to greenest preconsciousness, and to hoot like an owl... And then there is all the rest of it, the great sprawling jungle-setting of an Amos Tutuola novel filtered through months of mind-altering sleeplessness and religious contemplation of bees, raw meat, libidinous patterns and the shapes in navel-lint... Anyone can make a rock album but no one else could have made this, as rare and as exact as the very last member of the Table of the Elements."
1,Like an alcoholiday on a polluted beach!,"Careful, there! You almost stepped on something terrible! The beach is usually beautiful, but you can get hurt if you just go off anywhere without looking first. They should have put some buoys around this lurking monster. Better luck next time!"
1,The three card monte of music.,"This album is a trick, I'm sorry to say. It was an experiment to see if people would pretend to like a bunch of bollox if it had enough promotion. A similar experiment was done at an art exhibition - they showed paintings that were done by affixing a brush to a donkey's tail. In both cases, people who pretend to like it come off as absolute nitwits. Don't be hoodwinked; don't even try to pick the red in this album, it's all black."
1,not all experimental music is good!,"Just because something is experimental doesn't mean it's a work of genius! Don't get me wrong, I love experimental music, but this is a disorganized mess. I like voices that aren't strictly ""good"" (like Jeff Mangum's, for example), but Beefheart's voice is horrible. If you want to hear some GOOD experimental rock, listen to Kukl's ""Holidays in Europe"". And for those of you saying this is the masterpiece of 20th century music, go listen to Schoenberg's ""Pierrot Lunaire"", Stravinsky's ""The Rite of Spring"", Bartok's ""String Quartet #4"", Lutoslawski's ""Partita"", Crumb's ""Black Angels"", Martinu's ""Double Concerto"", Hindemith's ""Kammermusik #1"", Ligeti's ""Etudes, Book I"", Penderecki's ""Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima"", etc. etc. etc..."
1,Drug-crazed trivial nonsense,"Uggh. Come, now - surely they can't expect us to think that they MEANT for it to turn out this way. Beefheart was a notorious prankster, but an exceptionally untalented musician. There isn't a single song here that couldn't have been written in 25 seconds of tootling. Beefheart plays two saxophones at once on some of these songs. Mate, that's just nonsense. A colossal joke on everyone who believes in music."
5,Masterpiece after all these years!,"At first listen one may think ""do these people know how to play?"" But like Gin, It's an acquired taste. This double album set was a very influential work in it's time. The Capt. once said that he wanted to be a sculpturer but his dad said he was not gonna let him go to school with ""all of them queers."" But alas, he chops at his music as though it were a chunk of stone, and the result is unique and a bit disturbing. ""Orange Claw Hammer"" is a good example of this that features the Capt. singing into what sounds like a dictaphone, clicking on and off, as he appears to make up the lyrics as he goes. Do you like the taste of Gin?"
4,Holy Tits,"I've had this for years, and I never really liked it. Steve Malkmus, among other indie rockers I love, still praised it, and I thought maybe there is something there, but it's too inaccessible to even warrant the trouble of listening to it. PRETENTIOUS BULL ROAR. Anyways, I've been listening to a lot of GBV the past couple years, (as in, almost only GBV) because in 50 years the rock writers will relent that GBV is the greatest band ever. Anyways, I've become much more aware of poetry and how words and rhythms are amazing. I've also been reading Mark Twain, among other artists. And while writing a school paper just now, i casually returned to this for background music. And I just had to take a writing break to write this review. This actually is poetry, it's abstract like Picasso and Dali, but it's americana music. Yes it's a hard listen, but if you're in the right mood it's perfect! I'm really glad I bought it."
1,This sounds poopy!,"Yep, there's a definite smell of ass to this thing. It took me awhile to place it, but there's no denying it - ass."
3,"Excellent for Rigging, but not for modeling.","Yes, this book is an excellent one if you would like to create an advanced rig, but the earlier modeling chapters don't teach good modeling skills (just look at the student models he put in, only a few are good. I'd be embarrassed to put put the other ones in a book.) That said, the book is excellent for learning how to create a rig and intuitive controls for the animation. The cover price of $45 is probably worth the detailed rigging section, but since the rest is a waste, it's really not a fabulous deal."
2,This item costs more than you think...,"If you purchese the Video Now make sure that you have plenty of money for batteries, and accessories. I'm not sure what Rocket Scientist came up with this toy but they obviously didn't realize that there was a color t.v. revolution. I'm sorry that my grandfather spent the money on this thing and I'm even more sorry that I wasted a wish on it. I'm a girl and I don't mind the shark week thing right now, but I would like to see Lizzie Mcguire, That's so Raven or other interesting episodes."
5,Detective Novel That Hits a Homer,"""Squeeze"" is about baseball, or at least crimes connected to a fictitious minor league team and its star player, but even NON-baseball fans who love a good mystery and great dialogue will enjoy this first novel by Steven Pipe. Reminds me a bit of of Stuart Kaminsky's Toby Peters detective stories, although this one is set in the present time. I hope there is a sequel in the works!"
4,Informational.,"As a psychology major, I'm used to some dry reads, and this went along with the dry reads for me. Luckily, though, it's very informational and has many examples. The author realised that a lot of the information isn't all that interesting, so he was sure to follow every bit of material with a real-life example. While this is usually annoying in books, I found it incredibly helpful in overcoming the course's boring nature. If you are a professor, I recommend this text. It's cheap for students since it's an older edition, but it is still relevant to introductory experimental psychology courses."
3,No books,"We bought this for our 4-yr daugther's birthday. i'm a little confused because one of the first statements on the audio CD is ""open your book to...""... our CD did not come with any books. I do think that would be a nice addition and am somewhat disappointed. We are still listening to the stories, so cannot comment fully on them yet."
3,"Too much author, not enough subjects","This is a mildly interesting book and a basic introduction to the Hasidic way of living and thinking, especially among teenage Hasidic girls. But I thought there was waaaay to much emphasis on the writer's opinions and projections on what she was observing and waaay to little personal information about the actual subjects of the books: the girls themselves. The actual, supposed subjects of the book seemed to me to be little more than cardboard figures occasionally glimpsed among the deluge of words about the writer's own personal opinions about all sorts of non-Hasidic things, like how best to teach teenage girls in typical USA environments, and what kind of interview techniques she used, and what other researchers were saying about the education of teenage American girls. Not much insight into the girls themselves, not much flesh and blood in the personalities."
5,Great Fragrance,It has a wonderful fragrance and a clean feeling after a shower! A little goes a long way.....would recommend it!
5,Home Run Derby: The Complete Series,"This series is a must for true baseball lovers. It is exciting to see the the greats, many of them in the prime of their careers, showing off their home run prowess. The series consists of three CDs, each well produced . I believe these contests took place in 1959, at a minor league stadium called Wrigley Field(not the one in Chicago). For the price, this is a great deal!"
5,Compass review,"Well we have had this seat for 6 months now and it is really sweet. The nicest made car seat of all we have utilized as the kids are growing. Its the most comfortable and highest quality of all I looked at. I mean the only other one with similar ratings is three times the price. Like other reviews note the seat does not recline so sleeping the kids need a side pillow or their head falls forward. But the seat is really easy to adjust to the perfect height. It switches to another car in seconds. The foldable arms, cup and snack holders are sturdy. The fabric and padding and plastic are really well made compared to lesser models. I would recommend it highly."
4,An Amazing Book,"Even if you know a lot about the Middle East, this is an amazing book. It's especially disturbing in view of the recent suicide bombing in Israel by a young Palestinian college student, and I was only a few pages in when I couldn't put it down. The author does something you'd think is impossible. She made me understand the strange and sad logic behind suicide bombers, and particularly what would lead women into such acts.Maybe because the author is an American who lives in Europe, she has a special angle on this story, but it's certainly not one we're reading about or hearing much about from our own media. I agree with the professional reviewers quoted here. Anyone who starts this book will go straight through to the end, probably experiencing, as I did, something of what the author went through -- going from sympathy to despair to a prayer that things in the Mideast will change, and quickly."
5,I believe this is it.,"The author is a brave and honest man in tellling the way he feels the war is truly going. You can see how his feelings about this conflict start to change because of his actual first hand experiences. My hats off to this man for his honesty and courage. I think he gives an honest asessment of what is actually occuring over there without having an ""axe to grind""."
5,My boots have the same dust,"Paul & I walked the same streets but about 6 months apart. I laughed at the folly of his situation, only because I have been there. I cried at moments that many just will never understand. I struggled to put the book down. For me it was so much of reliving my time in OIF.Having seen first hand the efforts of IAVA [...], I am even more impressed with Paul and his book. It's one thing to volunteer for service, yet another to volunteer for combat, and still another level of commitment and patriotism to dedicate your life to your brothers and sisters in arms.Truly a ""must"" read for anyone who is a concerned citizen"
1,Ho hum,"If you are one of the narrow minded, single vision hate Bush, hate Bush, hate Bush crowd you will probably not be bored to tears by this tome, and may even enjoy it's bile. If you have more than two brain cells working then steer clear because reading this book will cost you dearly! Reickhoff has an agenda and if you really want to read his drivel, check out his blog, which is free. Save some cash and help the environment all at once."
3,It's no Depeche Mode,"Summarized in a sentence I would perhaps call it solid proof that Martin Gore is nothing without the other members of Depeche Mode. Don't get me wrong, I love the first song on this album and I am glad to own it for that song. But, the rest leave a lot to be desired with their cheezy melodies, and bad drum work. A disappointment, especially seeing as how this album was released so close to DM's excellent album, Violator. Die hard DM fans - get it, but get the other DM albums first."
2,Couldn't finish it,"Is there anyone out there who has? I found it tiresome in the extreme. And how come you can buy a hardcover copy for a buck but the paperback is $89? Gee, is somebody greedy because I don't think there is that kind of clamor for this book in any circles."
5,The evolution of Husker Du,"This is by far the best Husker Du album out there and by far the peak of their musical evolution from a 2000 MPH punk band to a style of music that is reminiscent of an early rougher REM.Equipped with a raw distorted vocals over a buzz saw guitar the music is played in a style that brings together all of the bands influences from 60s folk to early British punk. ""These important years"" is such a beautiful song full of reminiscence while ""Could you be the one"" Shows Husker had all the power and melody which should have made them big and why they never quite made it I will never know.I remember watching an interview with one of them saying it was hard for them to put out a video that was sandwiched between the usual MTV favorites but that cant be the whole reason. Maybe bad management, maybe just bad luck who knows?Anyone who loves early pop-punk needs to hear this one."
1,I love intenso and i loved because Rogelio is from Cerralvo,Me encanta me facina su musica mi cancion favorita de su disco por ti es la numero 6 me encanta y aparte que esta bien bueno Rogelio y pues ya saben nosotros los de Cerralvo N L somos muy simpaticos.La musica que canta Rogelio siempre ha tocado mucho y pues me da mucho gusto que pege su musica y ojala que siempre siga cantando como ahorita yo y mis primas somos su fan #1 y simpre lo seremos compren su cd y nunca se arepentiran INTENSO es el mejor TE QUIERE TU FAN #1
2,Just as good as the price !,"Pros:1.) Cheap2.) Looks PrettyCons:1.) Polyester - Not good to sleep in. Buy this only if you want to use it for decorating a bedroom/guestroom. Polyester fabric feels rough and coarse and is not at all worthy to sleep on.2.) Less thread countOverall, its just as good as the money it asks for !If you want to have a good sleep, then spend some more money on a 100% cotton comforter.All the comforters from Malibu seem to have the same properties."
4,BIG TRASH IS A BLAST!!!!!!,"NOT THERE BEST EFFORT, BUT A WORTHY ALBUM. THERE ONLY HIT FROM THE ALBUM [SUGAR DADDY]#28 WAS QUIRKY POP SONG,AND THE BEST TUNE FEATURED HERE. SONGS LIKE [THIS GIRLS ON FIRE]AND [BOMBERS IN THE SKY]ARE PRETTY GOOD AS WELL. I THOUGHT THIS ALBUM WAS UNDERRATED AND SHOULDVE BEEN POPULAR."
3,Best overlooked album of 1989,"I'll say one thing about these Thompson Twins,they are good at creating mood with manipulating synthesizers to their advantage.The album in classic Thompson Twins,part rock,part dance.Overall its very plush and sounds like its full of MTV hits you've never heard.It's late 1989 release didn't help it because most potential buyersof the lp were by then in college experimenting with underground.Great creepy-sounding title track."
4,Good Product,This was a good product. I purchased it to to go along with my wedding gown. It arrived within a week of the order and it's exactly what I needed.
4,Good mailbox for small notices on front porch,"We have a curbside mailbox with locking mechanism, but I needed something to mount on the front of the house to hold notices left at the house. We live in a very windy area and it is not possible for something to be left stuck on the front door. This is petite and served the purpose well. I really wanted something white, so we spray painted it white. It works great. Arrived well packaged and when promised."
1,Hayward Phantom TOTAL JUNK,"The very first day our new ""Top of the line"" Hayward Phantom pool cleaner was installed, it was a total flop. Having had pool cleaners before I figured it was just some adjustment, wrong! No mater what I did it wouldn't work properly. After 3 house calls by our pool installer they gave up and called the factory rep. He made two trips, literally rebuilt it the 2nd time, and it was a new, not used or rebuilt. Well it worked for a short time and then same old problems. Ties itself up in knots, spins out,won't stop spining, even ties the bag up in knots, plus it will not clean the bottom of the pool at all. Total Junk cannot wait to get a Polaris. Had a Polaris in our last pool, should have stayed with it. The Hayward Phantom should be recalled."
3,Be Forwarned,This is not The Highwaymen together. It is a compilation of the individual artists except for The Highwayman live which is a live performance without Willie. Some tracks have poor sound quality.
2,Disappointment,"I opened it a few days after receiving it and discovered one of the projects is not on there at all. I'd like to return it for an exchange or a refund. Some of what I saw was pretty good, but ""Rhythm & Blues"" is non-existent. Please advise."
1,Congratulations,Congratulations on releasing a game that doesn't work on all blu-ray players. That's a terrific business decision!
1,"The Takedown Removal Video For Braids, Hair Extentions, Drea",This is an infomercial to sell a product.
2,As abstract as it gets....,"This text was required for my Complex Variables course and no one in the class thought it was very helpful. The author is very abstract about concepts, gives no solutions to answers, and doesnt do that great of a job at explaining his points. This isnt even a real textbook! The only positive about this book is it is the cheapest book I have ever bought for college...."
5,Awesome Deal for ALL SBTB Fans!,"This DVD is a lifesaver for all SBTB fans! No more tapes to mess with, no more waking up at 6AM to watch a random episode... Its all over with this great DVD! And the price Amazon sells it for is great considering its TWO seasons! I'm excited about this awesome deal! So is every SBTB fan I know! Plus, two seasons double the amount of Zack Morris sitings! (wink, wink!)"
5,Niceeee,"This friekin reeks of awesomeness we got saved by the bell with the seasons now i won't have 2 wake up early to watch it. This is the greatest show ever. Almost everyone has seen it and if you haven't you should. You have Zach ""preppy"" which all the ladies love Slater ""jock"" on the football team and all the sports captian and the ladies also like him. Screech who makes it funny. Jessy who is against everything and wants it her way. Lisa the gossip queen. And my favorite Kelly Kapowski oh yeah she is so hott. So i recomend you at least go out and watch an episode and i bet you will like it."
4,"Loved the show, but ...","Extras were missing. Where are the actors talking about their characters? Where are deleted scenes and stuff like that? Missed that stuff, but still LOVE the show as much as ever."
4,No Extras but plenty of Laughs and Memories,"Although disappointed that there are no extras such as cast interviews or bloopers, I am happily surprised that one of my favorite shows growing up is now on DVD. The original airdate of each episode, including title and writing/producing credits, are listed in this set. The intro and the sound of the theme song changes before several of the early episodes. But overall, this set is worth the money if you love the show."
2,Not a romance,"Despite the hype this is book is not a vampire romance its more of the author's version of the vampire universe. It's unsettling how gory it is and it's amazing how quickly(very quickly)after the heroine is bitten how everyone becomes just meat to her.(Maybe I've been reading too many better versions of vampire stories-Anita Blake anyone?) Plus, she introduced so many characters who had different agendas I felt a little lost. I couldn't get past the first couple of chapters. This is the few times in my life I'm returning a book to get my money back. If you must read this don't go to a used bookstore, go to a garage sale."
1,A BLUNDER OF A BOOK,"I REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS BOOK. BESIDES IT WAS AWFUL. IT HAS SUCH OFF THE WALL INCIDENTS THAT,I AM SORRY, BUT I CAN NOT BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS EVEN ON THE BOOK SHELVES. I AM JUST GLAD I GOT IT FOR 50 CENTS AND DIDNT PAY ANY MORE THAN THAT. I CAN'T COMMENT ON ANYTHING AFTER ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK BECAUSE I COULDNT EVEN BRING MYSELF TO READ THE REST OF IT. UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT ONE STAR IS BECAUSE A ""0"" STAR RATING WASNT AVAILABLE."
3,Vampires and Star Trek.,"One of the rarer Star Trek novels, Bloodthirst was one of the first of many Star Trek novels and novelizations to be done by J.M. DillardA little on the dark side for a Star Trek novel, but then we discovered that Dillard writes Star Trek novels around darker plots."
5,A scientific text.,If you really want some good scientific material on solar hot water systems then this is a great book for that.Great for the student that is studying in this area or anyone that is in the business of solar hot water.The industry could do with a lot more of this sort of material.Great work.
4,Love Carla Kelly.,Great romance. Carla never fails to get you hooked into another romantic setting. Great characters. Love to see the change in Lord Ragsdale and with Emma.
5,Sweet sweet sweet romance,"This was funny for the awkward moments of falling in love. A woman can inspire a man to be better! Yes. It can happen. Get some inspiration and hope from this yes, ...sweet story."
5,The most electrifying CD of all time!,All the tracks in the CD are damn good!If u r a WWF fan and u love rap and hip hop then u should definitely buy this CD.....The best track on it is Stone Cold's Hell Yeah
1,Dissapointing to say the least,"Upon buying this cd i honestly expected more. The artists featured are all very famous, so it looked like this was a sure fire hit. unfortunately, what we have here is the original theme songs with a bunch of high as a kite rappers just totally randomizing and saying nothing at all. The rock's theme was especially disappointing, as the entire song consists of ""if you smell what the rock is cookin"" repeated over and over, as though we would find this beat to be fun to listen to. The only song, in my opinion, that is remotely good is the d generation x theme, mainly because it sticks so closely to the original theme. Overall this album is not worth the money: if you want wwf get the music volume 4. Get this only if you want to hear the result of one day in the studio and a lot of weed."
1,Don't waste your money,"this CD is truly awful. In no way does it represent either ""the Best Greek Bouzoukis [sic]"" or the ""Great Favorites."" And it sure doesn't sound like ""Various"" artists, either. Imagine a compilation of ""America's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Hits"" by the Lawrence Welk Orchestra, and you'll get the idea.... Tourist bait at its worst."
4,Great for warm sinus heat therapy - but there is an odor,"I have started having sinus issues in recent years, especially at night. This provides a wonderful moist heat that lasts for at least 30 minutes and really helps. The only issue I have is the smell when it's heated. i have no idea what it is. it is a little distastful at first, but then i get used to it."""
4,Very Very good..,"I think this a great album everyone should own, But I think White blood cells is much better. Buy one of them. The White stripes are a wonderful duo. Everyone should own one of there albums."
4,"Maybe not the absolute mindblow, but surely magic","Still can't get precisely what in White Stripes is so special, that they are unlike some other in wider appearance. They are basing so much on the things of past, still they are more authentic and fresh than plenty of record-companies-manufactured stuff of todays. Though earlier records are exposing beauties of rock-primitivism, this one deals with more varieties on the path. Kind of this couple is creating own version of rock history anew. What an approach. By coincidense, ""fat-bottomed-girls"" of 78-queen-jazz just appeared afloat in my collection these days, too (one thingie on disk is of similar material). Lennon shouting voice on the other. Returning circles of the past. My rating should be 4.99 - essentially, just because gave too many 5's by now to be treated seriously further :-) Thanks, WS!"
1,Too Cool,"I can't help but think the accolades this album has received is some sort of joke on us all. A social experiment gone awry. The army of young fans standing tall behind Elephant is very impressive considering this album stinks. The White Stripes are fun to look at, they are very stylish and cute, but the music is boring and tired. It sounds as if Jack White lets everything he writes go straight to CD. No care, no concern, just fill a CD and put on the red pants.The first song, ""Seven Nation Army"", fires up the White Stripes gimmick with a lot of energy that goes nowhere. The rest of the album is where the first song leads...nowhere. It's all filler.My best guess on Elephant's popularity is it's a peer pressure thing. But remember this, boys and girls, the same club that requires you to like this album will someday require you to think it sucks. Confusing? Maybe, but it's a lesson that can be learned from a book that is required reading in elementary school, ""The Emperor's New Clothes."""
3,isnt the best,I almost bought this c.d when I stopped to listen to all of the songs on the preview thing. Well this c.d is extremely inconsistent. I mean I simply love Seven Nation Army. It is one of my favorite songs. Fell in Love with a girl is another good song and the song there is no room for you here is decent. All the other songs are just plain boring and make you fall asleep. In my opinion if I am going to buy a c.d I have to like all the songs. They realize they only have a few good songs out there if they put a little more effort they might have a c.d I would buy. I like the White Stripes and there c.d covers are great and so is SOME of there music but if they want my money they need to be more consistent.
4,Elephant Ain't Playing For Peanuts,"Superior to their previous release, ""Elephant"" is a rocking and awesome album from start to finish. Whereas ""White Blood Cells (Sympathy For The Recording Industry)"" became repetitive and tiring after the first half, this record stays strong and vibrant throughout.Even though their style is classified as minimalist, the sound is anything but. Jack and Meg White vary things up in just the right order and amount, bouncing between wailing on their instruments and keeping things to barely above a whisper. Stand out tracks, in my opinion, are ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself,"" ""The Hardest Button To Button,"" and the terrific 7-minute, screamin' blues track ""Ball And Biscuit.""I was planning on passing up this release after being disappointed by the hype surrounding ""White Blood Cells,"" but ""Elephant"" is not a CD to forget picking up."
2,genius?,"please, i could squeeze out 12 songs that were written twenty or thirty years ago in two days. am i a genius, too? the only reason this got two stars is because it wasn't quite as boring and uncreative as their others. quite."
3,Hot and cold... but the hot is worth buying,"My review is a bit tainted, since I came into White Stripes midway through their career, and haven't been able to grow with them as a listener as they grew into their music. Elephant reverts a step from the more sophisticated ""White blood cells,"" which in all honesty I took for vintage Stones (before they needed a giant strobe light on tour to make them look like they were actually moving) and embarks on a more folksy bent. ""Seven Nation Army"" and ""Black Math"" are two songs that pop out at once, though, but the album gets far too cutesy towards the end - ""Little Acorns"" and ""It's true that we love one another."""
2,Damn..New Retro-Rock is really getting old,"I know a million people find this record as a breath of fresh rock'n'roll air, but after three records I find the White Stripes are getting insanely old. I'm over The Strokes and I murder anyone who puts The Hives in that same category. I bought this record a little while ago and I've never really gotten into it. I've tried and tried but i just can't. I don't personnaly recommend it to anyone, pick up De Stijl or White Blood Cells, they're definetly worthier of your money. All in all, one word can sum it all up: Disapointing.."
3,Decent album from a great band,"No doubt the white stripes are a great band. The album starts off great with Seven Nation Army. Black Math, Ball and Biscuit, The Hardest Button to Button, Hypnotize, and the Air Near My Fingers are the stand out tracks. When Jack goes to a more folky style, the songs are weak, both lyrically and musically. I can say that the 6 songs mentioned above are all great. The failure comes with the ""quieter"" songs. De Stijl, though many in this reviewing board have dubbed it as below par, I think is their best album. Elephant is definitely a good album and I'm happy I purchased it, but the rocking songs show the White Stripes branching into new directions."
1,What's all the fuss about?,"I have tried to like this band but in the end I don't get it. Yes, there's some guitar and very basic drums, but that alone does not constitute ""back to the basics"" rock. This is like unfinished music. Try any number of young bands out there really rocking actually using a bass and other instruments until you find one you like."
3,Like when the Rolling Stones went downhill,"Elephant is nowhere near as good as White Blood Cells, which is their masterpiece. This newest album is actually from 2002 and it shows, some of the tracks feel moldy, like sub-par B-sides or bad rehashes of their other great songs. A weird ordering does nothing to give the album an overall flow. Certainly there are some standout tracks such as Seven Nation Army, but on the whole this is merely average and should have been released as a 5 track EP, or as an ""unreleased"" CD after the band is dead and gone. Not to knock the Stripes as a band- this is probably still going to be the best rock album of the year- but when you're competing against your own brilliant self it's better to stop while you're ahead."
4,Meg White shines as usual!,"I give this album four stars just for Meg's impressive drumming alone. She really knows how to jam out on drums! Move over ""Keith Moon"", you've got some competition! Unfortunately, Jack White has no talent and makes this album crap, but Meg saves it. Bravo, Meg!"
3,lotsa hype...,"...but lotsa hype don't always cut it.If you think this is great stuff, then buy Led Zeppelin's ""How The West Was Won"". Zeppelin mined the same territory with better results...bigger, more textured, better songs. John Bonham or Meg White? Come on!"
5,The salvation of Rock and Roll,"This band is going to be the next force in Rock and Roll. The most exciting sounds since Nirvana and the Seattle scene of the mid-90's. Possibly one of the greats - with the Stones, Beatles, Hendrix, Iggy Pop, Morrison, etc."
5,Woah...,"The album descriptions have been well covered in previous reviews, so I just wanted to say that I have not been awed by an album since Radiohead's ""OK Computer"". By awed, I mean shaking my head every few songs in utter disbelief at what I was hearing. By the end of track 8 I knew that this is one of the best records to come out in the past decade. It doesn't matter if this album does or does not sound like previous Stripes efforts, or like the Stooges, or the MC5, or Zepplin, or whatever. This album is jaw-droppingly good in its own right. Thank you Jack and Meg."
3,"Its alright, it could be alot better","I do like this CD, but its not amazing. People say the lyrics are clever, well in a way they are, but they also sound a little outdated and corny too (the last song had me cracking up with how stupid it was). Jack White is an awesome guitar player, I'll give him that. Very creative and fun to listen to. Meg White on the other hand... not a very good drummer. She can keep a beat, but sometimes she sounds extremely off tone (ex: the chorus of Seven Nation Army). The best songs are Seven Nation Army, Black Math, Hardest Button To Button and Little Acorns."
2,To much hype,I remember when the White Stripes released this album and the radio was playing the pop lead song hourly. I always wanted to hear the rest of the album. I have to say that I wish I'd just bought that single.
1,Is it 1970 again? What is this junk?,"I just don't understand people's obsession with The White Stripes! They suck SO badly, Jack & Meg can not, I repeat, CAN NOT play instruments and are certainly not worthy of being ""rock gods""! 'Elephant' is one of the worst, most overrated albums I've ever had the unfortunate luck of hearing. I'm a very open minded person, but my intentions of hearing good music were gone and thrown out the window when this heap of horse crap was put on at my friends house.'Seven Nation Army' is probably a song that'll come to hunt me down for the rest of my life, because of it's intentions to try and kill me with it's bad riffs and VERY poor drumming.Jack White isn't a good frontman either, he moans and groans through the songs like a little pre-teen who didn't get their own way!And as for Meg, drumming has never sounded lazier!Please avoid & get some Black Sabbath or Def Leppard instead!"
1,two good songs 12 horrible songs one horrible record,this record was not what i expected i expected an upbeat rock song and i got sleepy time music. it would only sound good if i was drunk. just take my advice and download seven nation army and save 15.00!
1,PEOPLE! this has all been done.,"I cannot stand all these 'music fans' speaking in such high regard of these no-talent inbreeding rip-offs from Detroit. Stop comparing them to Nirvana, because Nirvana happened once and will never happen again. Instead of buying an album that sounds like a third rate compilation of Bob Dylan, Velvet Underground, Robert Johnson, and Zeppelin, why don't you actually buy those guys albums. PEOPLE WAKE UP, STOP SUPP0RTING MUSIC THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. Meg is ugly. (and untalented too)"
3,Elephant,"Elephant~ The White Stripes is a totally alright album. The sound is the typical garage sound and the lyrics are likewise. The singer sounds awful and his vocal skills are quite limited. To be honest, I had never heard of this band before and I did not have any high hopes for this album so to say that I am disappointed would be a lie. The book-let is really nice with cool photos and informative liner notes. Still I have no idea what they are singing about and the little ""story"" inside the book-let does not make any sense. This is an ok album that could have been better."
2,don't buy if you are a therapist,"This video is for home use only. It does not cover deep work, trigger points, sports massage or myofascial release like it claims. It is a good relaxing swedish routine for home use only."
3,Huskers' Weakest Effort?,"In an interview years ago, Bob Mould stated that Land Speed Record was Husker Du's only regret, but here is the album more deserving of embarrassment. Their Warner Brothers inaugural is the biggest letdown of Hüsker Dü's career. While earning some credit for daring to kick off a major label debut with the throat-tearing fury of 'Crystal,' the Dü quickly runs out of gas, trying hopelessly to redeem itself with such overextended oddities as the piano-laced 'No Promise Have I Made.' Put simply, Bob and Grant try too hard to rekindle the diversity and experimentation that worked so well - and so straightforwardly - on Zen Arcade. The results are awkward caricatures like the cloying 'Hardly Getting Over It,' and the nails-across-the-chalkboard acoustic atrocity 'Too Far Down.' If you're a first-time Husker listener, this is the one album to avoid."
1,Wasted money,This book is poorly written. The characters are not developed. I will not purchase another book by this author.
2,This Book Has Issues!!,"The author begins this book by writing an ode to all the ""haters"" in her life and in so many words telling them to step off. Well, after reading this book I have a word of advice for Ms. Johnson, they weren't hating, they were just being real with you.This book is poorly written and the characters and their situations are unrealistic and not fully developed. Seriously, how could Aliette and Sinclair have been best friends for so long and not known each other's marital status. Not to mention, Aliette had never been to Sinclair's home.Not to mention, there are some chapters where it is hard to determine who is speaking."
4,Really Enjoyed It,"My New Year's resolution this year was to read more, and specifically to read some books that would be outside of my normal choices. This one made the list. I really enjoyed the story, though it seemed like the author was unsure where to end it. There were several parts that had the feeling of an ending, but the actual ending seemed rather abrupt. Still, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a fun quick, read about redemption and self-discovery."
5,Yay book!,"This book arrived and my daughter went nuts. It was a used book but still in great shape, in my opinion. Just in time for Christmas. Thanks!"
5,Not Just For Kids,"What I love about Dr. Suess is that he makes moralistic points without being preachy. And in ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" Seuss creates a villian as enduring as Scrooge. Like Scrooge, the Grinch shows all of us that change--real, sincere change--is possible. That's a great message for young and old alike!Also recommended:Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices--another story (however, definitely not for kids) about an individual who ultimately is healed and transformed."
4,Christmas GIft,"I purchased this as a gift for my great-niece, she is 8 months old and I am helping her library grow with ""classics"" Thank you."
1,Doesn't work: don't buy it!,I was unable to get listenable music on any station.Low end of the dial: nothing.High end: barely audible over the noise.Shame on Belkin for putting this garbage on the market.
1,not good reception,"I've never tried another FM transmitter before so maybe my expectations were too high, but I cannot seem to get a signal that is not full of static unless I continue to move the transmitter around, which is obviously not feasible when driving. I went to [...] to get a list of radio frequencies for my area and NONE were clear of static. I plan to return this product."
1,Complete garbage,"After I purchased this item from Target, I found that no matter what station is selected, I get constant, loud hissing. Most of the time it is impossible to hear any music at all. Please save your money and buy another product."
1,Pay a little more for the docking station!!,"I'm a full-time college student, and being a commuter as well means I spend A LOT of time in my car. I bought this item 3 days ago and returned it today. It was easy enough to install but no matter what station you landed it, there was a constant audible hissing underneath the music. Sound quality was very poor as well, it sounded like my ipod was buried underneath a pillow. Turn up the music, louder the hissing gets. Not worth the money - I upgraded and got the Belkin brand docking station, MUCH MUCH better."
1,HATE IT....DONT BUY IT!!!,i bought this one thinking it was going to be good...but no it sucked..it is a waist of money...when i first got it..it didnt come in clean at all. it was all fuzzy and i could barly hear the music. DONT BUY IT!!!
1,Not the Same CD as Advertised,I bought this cd thinking it was recorded live(as some other reviewers stated) but it wasn't it. I was extremly dissapointed and returned it to Amazon. I would like to know the cd that everyoneis talking about...soiunds like it would be fun to listen to.
5,'Breathtaking' is praise that's not uncalled for...,"Movie reviews get swamped in jargon. ""Breathtaking."" ""Stunning."" ""Deeply moving."" These get used so often that they become cliches... and these phrases all apply to this film, so I'm usin' 'em anyway. I watch a lot of movies, but few move me to watch to show it to everyone I know. This is a richly human film that touches on these lives, these regrets, and these possibilities with a deftness that never overwhelms the truly liberating power of art, theatre, education, language, and storytelling. I don't want to spoil any more. This is THE movie to show anyone who thinks that Shakespeare is irrelevant, and I can think of few films better for getting discussions started with friends, parents, or kids."
3,NO ROOOM FOR CALF,"... the boots are very pretty and the material is a good quality one, unfortunately the size around the calf is not enough, it needs an extra inch or so for a size 8 1/2.. In other words, good only for VERY skinny legs!"
2,My Brother's a World-Class Pain: A Sibling's Guide to ADHD/,"This book did not quite meet my expectations. I have a daughter who is almost six and a son, who has ADHD, who is eight. Perhaps for an older child, this book would be appropriate. However, I found that I skimmed pages to try to find something that my daughter could relate to. More illustrations, in color, and less text would be more appropriate for children ages four to six. Perhaps more of a story line. Overall, I think she did get some useful insights out of it, but reading it to her was not an easy task. It is very wordy and comes across as written by an acadamician for a child. If I could, I would rate it 2.5 stars. I think the need is great for a book that addresses the siblings of children with ADHD. Perhaps one aimed at the younger child would help fill the need."
5,"For so many of us, it has been so long...","I remember picking this book up off the shelf when I was in fourth grade... that was a long time ago. Back then, I chose to read books by what their covers looked like. I know, don't judge a book by its cover, but when you read so much all the time, you start to be able to tell which are going to be the really good ones by what is on them. So, I picked this book up for some free reading, and it has taken me all these years to find it again. Unfortuantely, as some have pointed out, it is out of print. I really think that this is one of the best books that I had read when I was in elementary school. The entirety of it made a young girl's dream on the way to school come true. It is really powerful and timeless, a true work of art for minds of all ages. I just wish that I could find a copy of it..."
4,MORE POWER is MORE BETTER?,"Yes! It worked and cleared the clog! (4 stars)But watch out...and read the directions better than I did.Last night just as I was going to bed I heard my wife's voice, it sounded like a church bell ringing in the quiet of the night. ""Oh Joe the sink is clogged in the bath room.""I went and had a look, the sink was clogged solid. I remembered I had one of those new Co2 powered un-clogger. Why would I have one and why would somebody make a Co2 powered un-clogger (because MORE POWER is MORE BETTER)SO I put the unit together loaded the CO2 I installed the power disks and filled the sink with water.I positioned the un-clogger with a good tight fit over the drainAnd pushed down.WHAMI was covered in black smelly stuff and so was the ceiling and wallsMy wife came running in to see this nightmare and the two of us spent time cleaning up the massive mess."
1,not worth your time or $$$$$$$$$$$$.....,"Bought product...read info...loaded up.....and,nothing!! One cartridge, then another....used up 6 cartridges to no avail. Seems like this kleer drain should be kin to something ""billy Mays"" would sell. Completely useless ...( and my friends and I are licensed plumbers!)"
1,reviews,"Employees of KLEERDRAIN, Please stop posting reviews of your own product. You're only doing people a disservice. At least make your reviews less phony."
5,Forget you snake.,"This product is awesome. I spent 2-3 hours snaking the hell out of my clogged bathroom sink. I spent 5 minutes blasting it with this beast, and that was it. I used the blast shield but I still got back-wash on me, but it was worth it. Try this thing first."
2,Blade quickly dulled after 6 uses,"It's easy to hold and use, but it's not effective. within 3 months of using it, it started splintering my cat's nails. I use soft paws on my cat so I'm not cutting his nails that frequently, but this trimmer splinters the nails so much that it makes it impossible to put the nail caps on."
4,glycerin purchase,"Walgreens doesn't stock this anymore, so I tried 2 sources online. Both shipped the identical product at identical price. The other source used Priority Mail so was a day quicker."
5,Great for cheese and other things,"This doesn't look like it would cut cheese, but it does a great job. I mostly use it on mozzarella and cheddar. I like it better than my metal cheese knife. I also use it for cutting cakes and brownies in nonstick pans."
4,Nice Knife,"Cuts through cheese like a breeze. A little harder to control as far as slice thickness goes, as compared to a wire cheese slicer. A plus is that there is no wire to break!"
2,Fatal Flaw - Flexibility,"We go through a disturbing amount of block cheddar cheese in our household, so that's the task for which I judge it, but I have to say I was extremely disappointed with the knife's performance.It's a funny design that does, indeed, achieve its intended purpose. It glides right through cheese that grabs and holds a standard knife, requiring very little pressure to slice right through.The problem is that the blade isn't very stiff, so it bends and flexes while slicing through the cheese, making it impossible to get anything even *remotely* resembling an even, uniform slice. It may be a struggle to get a normal knife through the cheese, but at least the resulting cuts are straight.Very disappointing."
2,Misunderstanding?,"I'm a little dissappointed with this CD, I thought it was a video showing actions for the children's songs and all I got was a sound track which I could of bought here at a store. What I wanted was the visual actions that the children could learn . Have I just misunderstood the advertisement or am I just not understanding how to use this CD?? Could I have some feedback, please."
3,Could be better,"I got this case to hold a 7"" portable DVD player and all the attachments that come with it. Also so I could attach it to the back of my car seat for my kids to be able to watch a movie on long car rides. Well, it turned out that the case is too bulky when all the attachments are in it and doesn't allow the dvd player to open up all the way when attached to the back of the headrest. It's a great carring case but not so much when trying to watch a movie while attached to the back of the headrest."
3,A fast read,A fast-paced thriller with a sci-fi edge. Interesting characters and a timely plot structure make this an enjoyable read.
4,Basic Video,My wife gardens and I thought we could build a model railroad in the garden so we could spend more time together enjoying our favorite hobbies together. This was full of ideas. I have not pursued the hobby any farther but if you are looking at setting up a garden railroad I recommend this video.
5,Amazing debut album from a two-shot band.,"Kilgore (Smudge) lasted about an eyeblink in terms of music careers, but this album and ""A Search For Reason"" are incredible finds if you like hard rock/ metal that isn't hewn to the standard formula.I first heard them on WSOU, back when it played metal and had a real music department, and kept catching stuff from ""Blue Collar Solitude"". Ran over to Vintage Vinyl and scored me the CD, and just blew up at how good it was. It was a front to back winner, made me real glad I had 'SOU in my neighborhood.Understandably, the material is slightly dated but it holds up very well, especially if you consider what constitutes metal today. Jay Berndt, you'll swear, is three different singers on this album, and his lyrics are not fluffy or light. There's just hook after hook on this CD, and it's worth whatever you paid.Fred"
5,Inclusive in its appeal,"In ""Good Intentions"" Duke Robinson offers the distilled essence of his faith journey. In language that cuts across the exclusiveness of cultic talk he speaks in an inclusive way about life and the role grace and truth can play in its living. In our family there is a wide spectrum of religious orientations and of no orientation at all. We have given copies of ""Good Intentions"" to each one confident that it will meet them where they are and add a dimension of richness to their lives."
4,"Had a problem, Amazon solved it","This screen worked fine as a backup camera monitor in my pickup, for about a week. After that it started blowing fuses and within a week failed to power on. I was on a road trip on a bumpy road, so it may have been stressed. I returned home about 10 days after the 30 day return window. The Amazon service rep believed me and sent a replacement, which is working fine so far. I have only had it for a few days, so I don't know how durable the new one is, but the price was right and Amazon's service was outstanding, so I have no complaint. If the new one fails. I will update this post; otherwise you can assume it is still working.I like the fact that it accepts 2 inputs, one from the truck, one from the trailer. The menu on the remote is intuitive. You can flip the image horizontally or vertically, which is great if you want to mount it on the rear seat middle headrest as I did."
5,The Best Ever,"I have an older Kitchen Aid mixer with not as much power. This goes through big batches of bread dough easily and without strain. It is definitely worth the extra money. There was a minor scratch on the mixer, but I can live with that. Just thought that Kitchen Aid should be a little more careful in their QC inspectins before putting in the box. The scratch is hard to see and blends in with the paint, so no big deal."
1,Something is missing??,"I'm about to buy a battery for a 1956 Ford Thunderbird I'm rebuilding....its an odd size and the photo in the add makes me think this battery is a perfect fit.....but darn it anyway..............somebody forgot to add the dimensions in the add.Thus, without my ever buying the battery this customer is less than pleased with Amazon for allowing such a poorly written add....................Add does not say this battery IS or IS NOT a car battery.....the add and photo are both misleading and why are no dimensions given? Seems dumb to me!"
2,No actual vent makes these a mess to use,"Apparently they dont' sell gas cans that have vents on them anymore. This leads them all to claim to be 'self-venting'. Well, what it really means is that they are going to go glug glug glug and poor slowly, and probably cause you to spill gasoline all over the place. I'm sticking to used gas cans, I'm sick of buying these inferior products."
2,not worth it,"This could be useful for beginners in terms of getting their bearings on the instrument, but several of the tunes aren't written in tablature, and there aren't that many to begin with. Most annoyingly he explains midway that he can't be bothered to break a tune down note by note -- sorry Rob, that's what these are for. This is an expensive primer with not enough to justify the cost. You're much better off getting David Hamburger's excellent dobro workbook, with extensive tab and a CD. You'll save money and learn a great deal more."
5,Great buy,These classic songs are great for the kids! Mine love it and you will probably find yourself singing them around the house out of habit like we do :)
2,warranty is worthless,"I purchased this case on Nov. 24, 2010. By the summer of 2011 (end of August or beginning of September), I started having performance problems with the computer. All attempts to diagnose the problem led nowhere for weeks. Eventually, the case fan started making a high pitched sound. I sent an e-mail about this to Cooler Master, but received no response. So much for the warranty! I purchased a new fan at Fry's and installed it. To my surprise, this not only eliminated the noise, but also solved the performance problems."
3,stiff but looks good,this bag is a flashy nice bag but its compartments are small and the bag is stiff. I enjoyed it for months but ultimately I needed more room.
3,....,"This is a terrible introduction to Gang of Four. The main reason being that Go4 only has two worthwhile albums, unless you're interested in hearing what they can do with drum machines & female background vocals. The first half is good, but save yourself the pain and get Entertainment!. If you like that(which if you're interested in the first place you will)then track down a copy of Solid Gold. People who would buy this in the first place aren't going to be interested in crappy ""let's try to get a #1 hit"" synth pop fodder like ""Is It Love"" & ""I Love A Man In Uniform"". BUY ENTERTAINMENT! DO NOT BUY THIS."
3,Huffy Alpine after 1 year use,"Purchased my Huffy, and one for my wife one year ago. Looks great for the price.I am 200lb male and I don't baby it, yet I use care when shifting gears and keep it maintained. Took it on one mountain-bike trail and it performed very well. I was surprised. I purchased a Huffy other than a not well known brand as I wanted to be able to source parts for it in 10 years. Problems, both bike pedals have cracked and split from use. They are just plastic. Kick stand is poor quality. I have to tighten it often and it does not seem long enough. After purchase I had to adjust a few cables and items but nothing serious. Went camping with it and noticed after a brief minor rain it tries to rust in a few spots such as bolts/srews and bare metal areas not well coated. Note to self, should wax it when purchased. Nice bike for the price. If you ride often or plan on strong use, I would have purchased a more robust bike, but if all you have is $95, it is a nice bike for the price."
3,My bike was less than perfect,"The bike is a decent one but it came with a cracked reflector and a small part missing, the seat clamp. also I had to have the gears adjusted immediately and I bought a new seat because the one that came with it was uncomfortable."
5,Pretty good drill,"I use this drill for almost every task including driving screws. I think their variable speed statement is a little lacking. I didn't buy it for that fact so it doesn't matter to me. Trying to pull the trigger slowly never works. I would recommend at least a 3/8"" if not a 1/2"" air hose no longer than 50 feet in order to keep the line pressure up."
5,Grace,This album should be in every dance person's collection. It should have been number 1 for weeks! It's excellent. Order it you will not be disappointed.
4,Fascinating and twisted fairy tales,"I read this book fast in one sitting; Donoghue's stark but evocative prose brought the interlinked tales vividly to life. The celebration of affection between women is subtle and refreshing, and, though prose and characters seem simple, they are nuanced. My favorite tales were the reworkings of Beauty and the Beast (who is ""not a man"") and Snow White, which concentrates on the relationship between the girl and her stepmother. Donoghue's reworkings subvert classic tales in sophisticated ways that challenge any reader, especially the young adult audience that this book is ostensibly for."
3,Where's the Westside Connection side of Cube?,"I gotta be honest. I bought this album but haven't listened to it too much cause I'm not into into radio/dance stuff. The song with DRE is tight, but then again just about every song with DRE lately is tight. If you want more hardcore, gangsta, Cypress Hill-trashin' lyrics, you're not really gonna find it here. Maybe he slipped in some hardcore stuff on here, but the ""more radio-friendly"" tracks on this album aren't what's usually bangin' for me. Check out WSC if you wanna hear some real rap."
2,Pretty dissapointing,"Well After buying the fitsr war and Peace I thought This album would really pack apunch.. nah.. the only good track is HELLO with dre, I wouldnt suggest this cd to you unless its under 5 bucks"
4,Ice Cube is nearing the end,"I loved the album, but I think Ice Cube is just about done. His themes are starting to lose their originality and inventiveness. But he still knows how to spew lyrics. The beats are phat, incorporating an almost club feel to his songs. The highlight is hearing the new NWA, but there are other songs on this album to make it worth your while."
4,Better Than War!!!,"On this album CUbe comes off with a laid back attitude. Less agressive than usual. The first single with Krazy Bone shows a matured artist. He gives advice to kids. On ""Record Company Pimpin"" he gives advice to up and coming MCs. Then he shows the humor that people like about him on the Pimp Homeo skit and Roll Day. The best cuts, however, are ""Hello"" and ""Keep It Gangsta"" where he is joined by others. He doesn't seem challenge to do his best until he has people around. This is no where near Amerikkka's Most Wanted or Death Certificate, but I would sugget this album."
4,CUBE VISION !,"THIS IS THE SECOND ICE CUBE ALBUM I OWN AND I DON'T REGRET BUYING THIS ALBUM ""WAR AND PEACE (THE PEACE DISC)"".HERES THE GOOD TRACKS TO ME 1,3,4,7,8,9,13,15,17.MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS TRACKS ARE 1 AND 17.BUY HIS ALBUM NOW ICE CUBE BACK AND BETTER."
3,it's unfortunate that they couldn't leave the original intact,"nice to have this LP on CD, but I don't understand why they chose to remix 5 of the tracks--including the big single, MONSTER! They still sound good because they aren't overly remixed, but fans of the original LP will distinctly notice differences in the sounds of the songs. the five tracks remixed are:MonsterCut the ConcreteSummer in HellIt's Time To Kiss(with Patti LaBelle)This Planet's a MessBoonga(New Jersey Caveman)Too bad they couldn't have included the original mixes in the original line-up and then tacked the remixes on as ""bonus tracks."" Because chances are, this album will never be reissued with the original mixes on CD..."
4,Like this guy could be any stranger...,"The genesis of this album is a little obscure.This is titled ""Fred Schnieder and the Shake Society,"" but I have an earlier CD (and LP, come to think of it) that is titled only ""Fred Schnieder.""To further confuse things, I have a LP that goes back to some time around 1980, titled only ""The Shake Society,"" with a fabulous martini-themed cover, that is, cut-for-cut, identical to this album.Anyway...Any album whose best cut is titled ""Monster in my Pants"" is okay with me.This is very much like a B-52's album except that no one was looking over Fred's shoulder. The results are amusing.So, what we have here is a B-52's album with even more obtuse lyrics. ""Cut the Concrete"" is a mindless gem.So, if you collect things B-52, you won't regret this little chunk of musical frivality."
5,Lean Treats,"Dogs love this treat! A great treat for a dog because they are lean. We break the soft treats into about 6 pieces to give our dog, so, she gets several treats for one ~ otherwise, she'd swallow it whole."
3,The First Classics,"if you like classicle music and you're just starting out, then this book is for you! It's easy and edited well, making it simple to play but it doesn't loose it's classicle theme."
5,Amazing,"This wrench really lets you get to hard to reach places, and saves a lot of time. Fantastic quality as well."
1,POS,"I was looking for a cheap microscope for simple plant observation... Item was received received quickly cheap plastic, switch very flimsy, after wrestling with it a minute and finally getting the 2 AA batteries in the light doesn't even work. Although it was only $6 plus another $6 for shipping I feel I overpaid. Waste of money, I suggest paying the $20 at least to get a reliable product."
3,great close up view but a little unwieldy to use.,"This 30X microscope requires two handed use - one to hold scope, one to adjust view - leaves you with no hands to hold items to be viewed. If you don't need to hold the item to be viewed, it is fine for someone with adult level coordination skills. Good value for the price."
5,Teresa Brings Smiles,This is an excellent retrospective of a terrific popular singer who made people smile for over fifty years. The songs are straightforward ballads and jazz and novelty and meant for sheer entertainment. Nothing here for the dark side.
1,i have asked seller to cancel this order!,"Because i just knew my dorm cannot receive any packages by USPS, i canceled this order a month ago, why there's still this order?"
4,Director,This is an excellent facial product. There is consistency in the lotion's formula and absorbs quickly.
3,"Watch is great, Timex service could be better","4 Months after I purchased this watch, the dial that is used to set the analog face of the watch broke off. Timex offered to repair it, when I send it to Little Rock, AR and wait 4 weeks for the repair to be complete.Timex Men's T45171 Expedition Analog and Digital Combo Watch"
1,Do not buy this watch,"I have always purchased Timex watches for my husband. He has always preferred them to any other watch brand. This watch was terrible, it does not keep time at all. He says that the watch is the worst ever. The Velcro doesn't even stay shut and it feels cheap."
2,Was great then Broke,"I had this watch for about 2 years then the digital stopped the hands tick but the digital stopped not button response ...nothing. I thought timex were supposed to keep on ticking >>> LOL. I also feel that the hands were a it wide hart to see the digital part from any thirty.. i.e. .. 4:30, 5:30, 6:30.. The hand block alot of the tiny screen. I like the band as others stated it was very comfortable. But he the whole watch feels chincy. the silever part that spins on top is very plastic, I wouldnt reccomend cause it broke. But maybe as a kids watch??/"
3,Watch,The watch arrived in a timely manner and was a nice watch except the band was velcro and that I did not like.
1,Not as described,"Advertised as mens watch, but band was a max of 7"" long.Watch came unmounted & loose in the box & with no instructions of paperwork.I rate this purchase a dead zero."
5,Good Value For Money,"The Spotlight Kid - heavy. Beefheart made his band slow down, and support the voice, which is lazy and bluesy. The material's pretty imaginative and great in its way - interestingly, some songs and some of the parts are things played on ""Trout Mask"" briefly, here spun into central riffs rather than passing phrases.Clear Spot - benefits from crisp production via Ted Templeman. Some of the material is abject [crud] that prefigures Beefheart's impending sell-out, some is brilliant (""Big Eyed Beans"", ""Nowadays""), some is good stuff that would sound in-place on, say, ""Exile On Main Street"". This is a really good rock album for 1972, though less effective as timeless art than other of the Captain's albums.The liner notes - kind of laughable in that they don't even have an awareness that Spotlight was the first of the two albums released. But there are some nice Van Vliet drawings in there."
2,Not a serious work,"I am interested in doodles being used as a sort of projective test. In other words, can we study someone's doodles and tell anything about their personality or mental or physical traits or illnesses? I am interested in studying doodle interpretation to figure out a) how one is supposed to interpret doodles, b) how the standard ideas of meaning came to be and c) if there is any proven validity to the idea that doodes and handwriting can be analyzed with any effectiveness.But this book is not meant to be a serious work. Both of the authors do handwriting/doodle analysis and art therapy, but the book is like a Freudian dream interpretation book (doodling a heart means this. Doodling a house means that. So it sits in my doodle file as an example of a simplistic doodle dictionary."
3,SICKLES --MORE THAN INCREDIBLE,"ONE BIOGRAPHER OF DANIEL SICKLES THINKS ""INCREDIBLE"" IS TOO KIND A WORD FOR THIS POLITICIAN/GENERAL. AS A GENERAL HE RANKS WITH MOST OF THE POLITICAL GENERALS OF THE CIVIL WAR--POOR AT BEST. THE MOST INTERESTING FEATURE OF SICKLES LIFE IS HIS POLITIAL AND PERSONAL LIFE AND THIS AREA SWANBURG RELATES VERY, VERY WELL. SICKLES TRIAL FOR THE MURDER IN LAFAYETTE PARK OF FRANCIS SCOTT KEYE'S SON FOR SEX WITH MRS. SICKLES IS THE MOST FASCINATING. SICKLES WAS SUCH A FOREMOST POLITICIAN THAT HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEY WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. HIS TRIAL MAY HAVE SET THE PRECEDENT FOR THE NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY PLEA. THE BOOK OFFERS A VIEW OF THE POLITICAL MACHINES IN THEANTEBELLUM AND WAR YEARS, AND LEANS SOMEWHAT TOO FAVORABLY TOWARD DAN SICKLES. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL A BOOK WELL WORTH READING AND HAVING FOR PROFESSIONAL HISTORIANS AND THE READING PUBLIC."
5,John Philip Sousa is the best!,These 18 marches are the essential ones. The title says it all. Nothing else swells in the heart of an American than Sousa's Marches. You won't fall asleep during these excellent performances written by the March King! God Bless America!
4,Classic Crime Fiction,I read this book when I was on a Charles Williams Binge. I wasn't disappointed. The writer included some very good character study reminiscent of John Steinbeck into a remarkable crime novel.I would totally recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story.
3,they work,These units work and are very reasonably priced. They only have platese for the upper part of the ramp. I should have bought the more expensive unit that has plates for the bottom of the ramp.
3,Decent effort for the Burton-less Guess Who,"For their first effort without Burton Cummings, this really insn't a bad album. Donnie McDougal's vocals I always thought were good & I wish he would have been given more duty at lead vocals when in the band with Burton (Don't get me wrong, in my opinion, Burton's one of the best vocalist in rock) but its nice to change it up a little & only 1 Guess album really did this and that was the great but commercially un-successfull Artificial Paradise. ""Sweet Young Thing"" is actually one of my favorite songs of all time. I use to play in a band in the early 80's & we did a cover of it & it went over great. The mix on CD is a little too heavy with bass & the vinyl might be a bit more pleasing (also, alot of these same songs are on the U.S. release ""All this for a song"" & the CD sound quality is totally superior) anyway, this is worth a listen for any Guess Who fan."
5,Simply Celestial,"This CD definitely takes you away. It's perfect for relaxing in the bath, meditating, trance, napping....I've enjoyed it for all of the above purposes. In addition, my neighbor in the apartment next door asked about it one day, telling me that it helped to calm her distraught daughter during teething and get her to sleep when she heard it through my wall. If you have stress in your life, (and who doesn't?) let the melodies give you wings to drift away for awhile."
5,The best of all time,"This CD is simply the best I've ever heard. The music is fabulous, and the remix is better than the original version. I have listened to Falco since the 80's, and this CD is still intoxicating. Thank you, Amazon.com, for making Falco available to his fans!"
1,Bad Musical Movie,"Like the other reviewers, I must agree that this is one of the worst films you can ever watch. It's timing release was bad, the story is more cheesy than a triple-cheese pizza, the inclusive add-ins of acting make no sense, and the circus stuff is even more ridiculous. I think the entire cast and crew were so high on cocaine and LSD that they completely justified it, include the hippie movement at the end of the film. Totally ludicrous.This film also severely hurt the film career of Catherine Mry Stewart. She nearly bounced back after ""Night of the Comet"", but then ""The Last Starfighter"" shot her back down, mostly ending her film career. In all honesty, this is a movie to get high on, or to bang to. This film was exactly like Xanadu, musical and creative, but way too cheesy and timed all wrong. Yes, throw this into the Worst Films Ever bin with Blues Brothers 2000 and Poltergeist 2 & 3."
1,Word of Warning,"Thanks to ""Anthony Walker's"" fear of being identified, we do not know if he is a real person or really if anything he is writing is true. He works at ""A Prestigious American Hospital."" At best this is letter to Playboy and at it's scariest this man is one of the 10% of men in the mental health profession who admit to sexually assaulting their patients. Because the provider/patient relationship creates such a power imbalance, it is not legal or possible for a patient in the psychiatric care of someone to ""consent"" to a relationship. ""Anthony"" is a coward who has not given his ""wife"" the chance to defend herself. I think in all likelihood, she would tell us a very different story about a controlling and abusive man."
2,There is Help out there,I read the book very quickly. It as really an easy read. I am a BPD but didn't understand why the girl in the book didn't receive better help. I know for a fact that help is out there. I was discouraged that she didn't get the help she desperatly needed. I am proud of myself to know that I can do better than the character in the book. It seemed to me that everyone just enabled her to be sick and not receive the help that is available.
2,Good Voice - Not the best songs,"I you like cheesy 80's music, you'll probably like this CD. I the more popular, good 80's music, but Marilyn's CD didn't quite do it for me. But I do like the ""In My Wildest Dreams"" song. It's not the song I was hoping it was when I bought the CD. I was hoping it was the song on the movie Mannequin, but no such luck. Anyhow, I wouldn't say it's worth buy the whole CD just for that one song."
5,She's Mine Again!,"I've waited forever for this one to come out on CD. The remastered issue is excellent. In the 80's I wore out my cassette rockin' to this lady. Initially Marilyn was a backing vocalist for Stevie Nicks when I first became aquainted with her talents. Two of my favorite cuts are, ""Night Moves and Turn it On."" Although she had a hit with the guitar-driven, ""Night Moves,"" the suits just never knew what to do with such a versatile artist. In fact ther are eight producers on this CD. Worst still, her follow up album they tried to turn her into a dance act! Enough said. This sultry singer rocks!!"
4,Beachside Bench: Convenient and Comfortable,"I do not own the print being sold, but coming from Westport, Connecticut, I can say that I have sat on the bench shown in the preview image. It is quite a solidly constructed bench and is comfortable to sit on albeit a bit sandy. It is also located quite close to the water, allowing you to look out on the Long Island Sound while taking a rest from walking on the path that the bench is conveniently placed next to. And if one feels nature's call, they need not despair! Bathrooms are close by off to the right of the bench and are open at all hours."
2,Better Greatest Hits Available,"I dont own this item, and will not own this item. There are far better Greatest Hits packages to purchase for the KISS Fan. I recommend ""Double Platinum"", ""Smashes Thrashes & Hits"" or even the very latest ""Very Best Of KISS"". There are more songs and from a wider scope of their career."
2,Nice to Have but Not Worth the 2 Bucks,"If you were interested in buying a KISS best of then you should either buy KISS GOLD or Very Best of KISS. I like this CD but it doesn't define the hits of KISS like it should but the problem is that every KISS fan has a different opinion on the best in some way so i can appreciate what they tried to do here. Yet KISS GOLD is unique because it contains everything by KISS you love. I bought this when i first started listening to KISS and it was cool then but now that i have a few albums of theirs i am thinking ""What the hell?"" And of course since i got that i had to get 20th Century Best of KISS Volume 2. Dang, i was a dumb kid."
1,Don't waste your $!!!,"Hey, I'm a Die Hard Kiss Fan, but I would not buy this because this is Gene Simmons Just putting the Kiss Logo on a product that if you are a Kiss Fan, you already own. There are better greatest hit albums for Kiss out there. ie Greatest Kiss or Doulble Platinum."
3,Skimpy and cost IN-effective,"With last year's excellent ""Very Best of Kiss"" with 21 remastered tracks available for 2 or 3 dollars more, who needs this skimpy and obvious collection? Resist the corporate suits that expect fans to buy anything and everything!"
2,a fair to midland synopsis of the life of Adi Da.,"Looks to me like all of his devotees have given thier summary and subsequent 5 star rating on this book. I enjoyed the book, as I have enjoyed many of Adi Da's 50+ books in the last 20 years. There is nothing new here. Be warned, this Guru claims to be the hero of all hero's and the Guru of all Guru's. The ""First, Last and Only"" incarnation of God in human form. If you can swallow that, then go for it. Carolyn Lee's style is kinda drivel-ish. Carolyn sings like a little songbird (shehas a Doctorate in Musicology from Oxford) - not a lot of gusto & depth, but a sweet tweeting, I would say, with lots of not-overly-realized-on-a-personal-level ""oh he's so great"" effusions, which become rather tiresome."
1,Leaks!,I bought this thinking they would actually be better than the drop-ins however they are not. They leak and are horrible! Will not use.
2,Not what I wanted,I guess I didn't read close enough or something because I expect the solid ringed droppings but these are on a roll and have to be stretched over the mouth of the bottle. I used them because I would throw them away and they couldn't be returned since the box arrived very damaged(purchased with many other things and amazon didn't pack well) but I would never ever buy these again they were a huge pain.
1,Might be fun if it stayed in one piece...,"To be blunt and frank, this toy is a piece of junk. My daughter, who has recently become a Polly Pocket fan, picked this out for her 3rd birthday. She was adamant that it HAD to be a swimming pool. Well, neither my husband nor I can get the slides to stay in one piece or to stay attached to the towers. The swings keep pulling off as well. My poor little girl tries to play gently, but any movement at all and the thing falls apart. As I type, my hubby is attempting to super glue the whole thing together. Hopefully that will keep it ine one piece so Polly and her friends can slide in peace. As a side note, the ""color change hair"" of the doll included with our set barely changes color at all. And the door to the ""secret closet"" is also starting to pop off. Save your money and buy something else from Polly, something with less assembly required! Meanwhile, I plan to call Mattel and lodge an official complaint about the low quality of the toy."
2,Toy1,"My grandaughter enjoyed the toy, however it is flimsy, with several very small parts. Would not buy a similar toy."
2,Keeps falling apart!,"My two girls LOVE anything polly pockets, but this one kept falling apart. It was very frustrating for them to play with. The slide wouldn't stay in the slot. The one tab broke off to hold the slide. Would not recommend this item."
5,better and more fulfilling than the Mini Sieies - Empire Succeeds,"Ok I'll admit it. I saw the mini sieries before even knowin ghtis novel existed.. However picking this up I found it much more interesting than the sieries even though that was good too. While somewhat slow in the beggining its tale of econimc demise and sustaining interfamilial strife is one that could play out in any small industrial town in America. This is a story that hopefully will remain in the the catologue of oft-read works since it is fulfilling,enjoyable and really is worth the time to read - even if you have seen the sieries.Ted Murena"
3,This won a Pulitzer?,"I was disappointed after all the hype this book received. I was halfway into it, and still saying, ""When will something happen?"" Several plot threads were left hanging, most notably, what about Fr. Mark and the gay artist? Mrs. Whiting was so one-dimensional as to be a caricature. The pyschotic cat/familiar, her use in every conversation of ""dear boy"". Who says that?Also, the stereotypical Catholic guilt thing has been done to death. Come up with something original to slam Catholics for. Heaven knows there is enough material out there for that.There were some hilarious moments, touching moments, sad and disturbing moments, but the plotting was so slow it ruined the book for me.I would have put it down halfway through if I were not reading it for my book group."
4,COME VISIT EMPIRE FALLS,"THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK.... LIFE IN EMPIRE FALLS AT TIMES COULD BE VERY SAD, AND THEN VERY QUICKLY IT COULD BE LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY. RICHARD RUSSO'S CHARACTERS CUT RIGHT TO THE HEART...WELL WORTH READING...."
2,"Detailed, humane and flawed","In his attempt to be the Chekov of blue-collar America, Mr Russo gets several things right -- Empire Falls displays a keen eye for detail, an unhurried pace, a humane investigation of characters in action and an ability to mimic the rhythms of life itself.The book, however, is flawed on at least two counts. First, the prose is little more than workmanlike. One expected more polish, more craftsmanship, at this level. And second, the narrative drive necessary to sustain a novel of such length is sorely missing. The characters have desires and drives, yes, but the action is strangely muted and bloodless -- making the book somewhat tedious to plough through.These two drawbacks make Empire Falls less than a triumph. Not deserving of the Pulitzer, in my humble opinion."
4,Poetic and elegant,"'Empire Falls' is a remarkably poetic, character-driven novel about Miles Roby, the soon-to-be divorced manager of the Empire Grill. He quit college and his dreams of a better life to return to his home town and be with his dying mom, only to get snared in the web of his mother's former employer (a villain almost Shakespearean in design, though much more subtle). Through Miles' story we learn the history of the town and of its people -- and it is remarkable how Russo manages to make each character and their story equally realistic and compelling. It is quite interesting to see how these people live, and how their actions have karmic repercussions as time passes. Russo paints a vivid portrait of a small town, and is equally capable of quaintness and jarring the reader. One hardly minds that much of the book is ultimately predictable because the journey is such a good one, and there will be at least one big surprise for the reader to ponder."
1,How On Earth Did This Book Win The Pulitzer?,"I just finished reading this novel and I am mystified by all of the acclaim it has received. Far from being an accurate depiction of small-town life, it is a dull, mind-numbing work populated by repulsive characters who resemble redneck cartoons more than flesh and blood human beings. Many times I wanted to fling the book across the room out of frustration with its snail-like pacing and terminally unhappy characters.If you're looking for a realistic portrait of life in rural Maine, try anything by Cathie Pelletier - particularly her Mattagash trilogy. These books offer everything - humor, heart, emotion - that EMPIRE FALLS fails to deliver."
2,Awful!,"I have never read a book in which each character deserves the fate that the universe has handed them.I tried...really tried to enjoy this book, but it just become insufferable after a while. The only way to improve this book is to give it to Philip Roth, and have him rewrite the story, and redact the story by about 125 pages. I'm pglad that I read it so that I can serve as a warning to others."
2,Good book. Pulitzer Prize winner?,"I'm shocked that this received the Pulitzer. I guarantee that if it had been written by a woman, it wouldn't have gotten a more than a kind mention. Yes, these are hardworking, salt-of-the-earth kinds of people, but it's essentially the story of a man's midilfe crisis. Toss in a hometown greasy spoon, a moody teenage daughter and a tough-as-nails town matriarch, and you've got it, right down to the ketchup-soaked hamburgers. Tough to wade through. Arrrgh."
1,Empire Falls,drags a bit and is less relevant due to its time period. I actually had read it several years ago but the plot is not memorable.
3,Humor Saves It,"Russo sanitizes the working class for middle-class intellectuals, confirming their bias and pandering to their tastes with a carefully sensitive, slightly condescending viewpoint. His characters have a quality of caricature, which works nicely with the humor, but real emotion is completely lacking. The ending seemed grafted on to the book merely to make it topical.Tick is a strong character--Russo writes teens very well--but her intuitiveness failing her with the troubled boy seems implausible. The boy himself is a misleading character, changing uncomfortably as the book neared its end. The book is exhaustingly long without adequate payoff. Still, Russo is wonderfully funny in places and this kept me alive as a reader."
2,Slow Burn,"I almost went to the last chapter in this novel. Slow all the way, mediocre characters, not much interest in any of them with the exception of the father and his jaunt with the old priest."
5,Great characters!,"Russo's characters are great in all of his books, but in this one, they are heartbreakingly real."
4,True,"Life in a small town. Russo can get inside people's heads. I like that.I liked this book. I thought it was very true. These characters are myfriends, my relatives here in my little town.I give Empire Falls an 8.5."
3,An ok Beach Read...,"..but nothing we haven't heard before or will remember very long after. I am actually surprised at the fuss that has been made over this book, as it doesn't really break any new ground and the last 25 pages have all the hallmarks of an impatient editor saying ""hey, c'mon, enough already, kill 'em all off or whatever but WRAP IT UP"" This leads to a more or less completely unbelieveable ""happy ending"" that frustrates as much as it resolves. That being said, I had no problems reading & finishing the book, and students who come from towns that are very similar to Empire Falls say that they are, well, similar to Empire Falls, so if you are looking for an apt description of local colour in Mid-Maine, look no further, but Great Literature? I don't think so."
2,A book with no ending,"Empire Falls is a good book: interesting characters, plot set-up, location--until it gets to the end where nothing is resolved. Deus ex machina everything clears up in a sentence or two thanks to a completely throwaway subplot that seems to exist just to give Miles an excuse to leave town."
1,Empire Falls the worst book I ever read,"Empire Falls is the worst book I have ever read. As an avid reader I find that there are books that I don't like, however, I finish reading them. I couldn't even finish this book I was so bored. Not everyone who lives in a small town in Maine is as pathetic as the characters Russo depicts in this book."
1,Depressing as hell,"I bought the book and forced myself to finish it because of the review. Really, if it were by my choice, I would not have read the book. It is (as you will find out, by this author) all about an abandoned American town which (if you were like me, a Hopper's fan, you would understand it) is a classic example of decline of a suburb. It is an economical as well as a cultural decline (if there was any economics or culture). I am not here to compare... We all have a choice as to what to read. For me, it is like an expired strip mall. When you drive by, you get a nostalgia feeling... inevitable, helpless and depressing. The novel is well written but the scene is like my impression, so hopeless that youth people are escaping from it. This kind of art is necessary but not entirely uplifting."
4,Empire Falls,This is another time I wish there were 1/2 stars in the rating system. I definitely would have given Empire Falls 4.5 stars.I really like Richard Russo. He is such a beautiful writer. I was sad when I finished this book because I knew all these people and so enjoyed following their lives. One of my favorites parts was when Miles finally arm-wrestled with Walt. It was great! This book is very character driven and I know a lot of people don't care to read books like this. I am not one of them.
2,This comforter not worth more than $10,"I just received the comforter today. It looks like that the comforter used a cheap material. I bought the comforter for $ 10, and thats the right price for this comforter. It looks different from the pictures."
2,It's not the Jimmy Swaggart crusade,"I'm not a big fan of jazz. I liked the worship songs and hymns that Dudley used to sing. His rendition of ""At The Cross"" during one of the crusades was the best I've ever heard. But I'll probably give this CD to my friend who likes jazz."
5,Fit for my non-standard shelf,"I had an older non-standard shelf (no branding) with this type of spacing, but the typical rubbermaid shelving clips don't fit. This worked perfectly for me. YMMV."
3,Mary Sue-ish,"The original character has promise but turns out to be a too-powerful throwaway babe. It was rough watching McCoy act completely goofy for her, to the point of picking fights with Spock over her. Did they time warp to Starfleet High? J.M. Dillard is a fantastic writer (""Bloodthirst"", ""The Lost Years"") but this one falls short."
1,Not for me,"A couple days after starting these I developed stomach pains and diarrhea. First thought was stomach virus. Stopped them to be sure. Symptoms went away. Tried them again. Symptoms returned. For me, a bad experience. To Amazons credit, I received refund."
4,"Short on LTCM, Long on History - Live by the Sword...","Bad News First: the book doesn't get into LTCM in depth until half way through - the history behind the players was interesting, but do we really need to know about Hammurabi? I began to wonder why there were so many analogies to physics - Dunbar's background explains it.I've been working on Wall Street for about 10 yrs with hedges funds and bond funds, so I find the detailed descriptions of the numerous trades interesting, but I'm sure it would tough for readers who don't work with these financial instruments every day.Good Stuff: A satisfying ending to a financial debacle... ...read the book and see what I mean - it's definitely worth it for those of you who can plow through the intricacies of multiple spread/arbitrage plays."
3,junkie paradise,"Gee, I wonder what was going on with Thunders, Phil Lynott and Steve Marriot in the studio together? It's a miracle this record was ever completed. This is the best Thunders solo album. Approach all the others with caution. They all have some good songs but if you're not a fanatic, you can skip most of them. You need to have this one fo sho!Check out Mighty High...In Drug City. Thunders lived in the same zip code."
3,It's crystallized ginger.,"It has good moisture, consistency, taste. Nothing to write home about, but good product for the price.Williams and Sonoma makes a crystallized ginger that has a more potent ginger flavor, and I think I was spoiled by that one. This is milder, but I suppose that's a taste preference."
3,too strong for me!,"I bought this as a possible cure to my pregnancy morning sickness. It's definitely too strong for me! The ginger is obviously of good quality and the chunks are large, but I just couldn't eat it. (I bought the ginger chews of this same brand and those were great!)"
1,Over priced,The same size of this product 3.5 oz. is sold at World Market for $2.45.This is overpriced and I'll look for it at T J Maxx.
5,big tender chunks well flavored,These are very fresh well flavored bite sized cubes of candied ginger. These are beautifully processed good ginger flavor with a nice bite but not too spicy. Pieces are a bit bigger than most packaged candied ginger and quite suitable for eating out of hand. They need to be chopped up a bit if you want to add them to cookie dough etc or add to jam. I've shared these with a friend who had morning sickness and used them on a boat trip in rough seas to avert mal de mer and for mild stomach distress they are a very useful folk remedy though of course they are mainly intended as a candy and condiment I will probably include some in a sauce/chutney to serve with duckling
1,Misleading product name,"Seeing how spray products have worked in other markets (spray butter, spray salad dressing, spray hair gel) I thought that this product would be a convenient way to apply lube without getting a nasty mess everywhere from putting it on.I was wrong. KY let me down. The lube does not come out from the bottle as a ""fine mist"" as what might be expected. Instead, it comes out in a forceful stream that splatters whatever it hits and gets everything around it messy.As a matter of convenience, you might be better served taking the spray top off and simply pouring the lube from the bottle the old-fashioned way. This gimmick simply doesn't work."
5,Good ToThe Last Drop,"This book was waaaaaay better than A Hustler's Wife, it was very realistic. Ceazia was going through some real sh-- and she has had enough. The ending was so powerful, I was like daaaayum. When I got to the end I really did not see that coming, I was taken for a loop. I am sorry I waited so long to read this book, I had really planned on reading it early this summer, but hey you kno what happens....Later....."
5,the sweetest revenge!,"this book was fast paced, action filled, and just off da chains. Chunichi told a sista's story with a heartfelt, realistic edge to keep me interested. The girl has skills with a pen. She is definitely a star on the rise. Carl Weber you picked a winner with this one!"
2,not feeling it,"well i was told to read this book. why? not a good book, but she deserves a second chance...thats it."
2,So-So to Bad,"My husband and are huge Indian food fans. These were watery and not so good. You could make some on your own so much better. Try GITS products that are also sold by amazon.com Unfortunately amazon is no longer selling them by the 10-pkg. box, so they are a lot more expensive tha they used to be. But GITS is a much better product."
2,Great Songs That Sound Terrible,Unforgivable. These tracks sound miserable because of overhanded noise reduction. Try to find these excellent tracks elsewhere.
5,Ragin Cajun Continued,"Some more music I could only dream about until now. I had the record album years ago, but now it is out on CD! If you like swamp music, you will love this. About 2 years ago I went to Kershaw's Web Site and requested he put this and Devil's Elbow on CD. He must of listened, cause here they are!"
5,Classic Marketing Advice in Layman's Terms,"Paul Flowers presents a series of 10 Principles of Underdog Advertising that point to classic marketing wisdom in a very approachable style. His real-life examples that he uses to illustrate his Principles are easily understood and can be quickly adapted by any ""underdog"" marketer and used within any business. I had to stop after each chapter to note the ways that I can apply his Principles to my own business and I came away from the book with a list a page long of immediately actionable ideas that I can use to make my marketing plans more focused, creative and successful. His technique for really understanding the customer's true buying emotion is unique in that he presents a matrix useable by any business to uncover what truly makes the prime target customer for their product or service tick.I urge every underdog marketer to get a copy of Underdog Advertising - it will revolutionize the way you approach your marketing forever!"
4,Very Enjoyable,"While I doubt this is ALL the best from Ireland, I really enjoyed the CD very much. I still think it is very funny that FORTY SHADES OF GREEN is part of something that is supposed to be traditionally Irish, considering it was written by Johnny Cash, but any song so well adopted becomes traditional. It is a song worthy of the title, regardless. However, it sounds funny being sung by anyone BUT Johnny. I LOVED GLEN NA SMOL...it is absolutely beautiful. And the Freemans' CARRICKFERGUS is my favorite rendition of the song. It is easy to make it very maudlin or VERY unlistenable (the Grehan Sisters' version) but the Freemans do right by the song. If this CD does nothing but give a taste of Ireland, then it is well worth the price."
2,Travesty,This CD has a lot of my favorite pieces of music. I thought it would be great to have them all on one CD. What a big waste of money. I have never heard Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata played so poorly. It sounded like the guy was pounding the piano keys with a hammer. There is none of the beauty of these pieces of music on this CD. Try a different CD (e.g. Best of the Millennium: Top 40 Classical Hits).Best of the Millennium: Top 40 Classical Hits
3,Nostalgic,"The title-track is great, but the other mixes are so so. The only mix that stands out of the croud is the Underworld mix, which is fantastic.Taken to consideration the timespan here, I guess 3 stars is fair.If you are new to Sven Väth I strongly recommend the ""Contact"" album!"
3,Marvelous Marv,"Here is truly one of gospel music's outstanding vocalists and in my opinion, one who has yet to achieve the recognition he deserves. In fact, leading up to this project's release date, there was very little elaboration, if any, about it. Though I knew about his forthcoming CD, for many it just happened to show up on music store shelves one Tuesday in July. The album is a blend of Praise and Worship, along with Ballads and Holy Ghost Funk. Marvin enlists a who's who of writers on this effort, including Aaron Lindsey, Tommie Walker, Steve White, Israel Houghton and Percy Bady. I especially enjoyed the foot stomper, ""Do you know him?"", the Latin flavored mover, ""That Name"" and Dr. Sapp's take of the Rudolph Standfield classic, ""Perfect Peace,"" produced by Donald Lawrence. ""Be Exalted"" is signature Marvin Sapp and for those who are alreadya part of his growing fan base - you will not be disappointed."
4,"Bulky, but it works","I purchased this to replace a broken AC adaptor. Although ours carried a different brand, the shape of it was exactly the same. It must be made in the same factory with a different name slapped on it. It works as advertised, but its shape is quite bulky."
1,Works but.....,"I purchased these beaters 6 months ago replacing beaters that were 15 years old because they were beginning to rust. Low and behold, in just 6 months time the new beaters are beginning to rust also."
1,Cheap,"Beaters came with one missing the buffer button on the bottom. The snap ring that keeps the beater in the mixer did not fit well on one beater and fell of the shaft when I tried to install the first time. It is so small I couldn't find it to try to put it back on. I contacted the seller and they basically said I am just out of luck. I would highly recommend buying direct from Sunbeam instead of these cheap Chinese things. Seller may have taken them back but by the time you spend for shipping and fuel to go do it, it is cheaper to just buy another set. I would highly recommend not buying these Chinese knock-offs."
5,Illustrated Kindle Edition,Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Complete play illustrated by Harry Clarke (60 illustrations)I have no doubt that this is the best Kindle version of Faust. The table of contents is linked to every chapter. Beautiful illustrations by H. Clarke. Superb ebook! Thanks!
4,Great book; a few kindle woes,"This was my first time reading Faust, and I have to say if it weren't for there being a free kindle version it would have taken me much longer to get to it. Amusingly, I read it while in Leipzig, where one of the scenes took place. The book is lovely, and its influence on other literature is quite clear. It is certainly an elegant and eloquent read. I will want to get another version that has extensive foot notes, however, which the Kindle version lacks, and there are a few blurps in the Kindle version where some lines seem to be missing words.Certainly a great read and a classic. Consider getting a different version that provides more context and perhaps has better text layout than the free version"
3,Meh,Kind of boring...but it reads quickly. I would try reading the other version before this one. Only read if you don't have anything else.
2,u need supper strength,"I oiled the moving parts as per instructions, the handle goes down easily, whoever it takes brute strength to get handle back up.It is almost like it sucks down on what you are juicing and won't release."
4,Navigator stands out now!,"This grill is awesome! My Navigator went from plain to chromed out with this sucker! It is super easy to install. Only issue is it is flat and most grill front aren't so it wings up some on the sides especially the bottom part, I can't crank it down tighter for fear I will break the original grill up but you don't notice it unless you are close up. Also, my hood no longer stays up on it's own because of the weight of this. I have had no over heating issues, the temp gauge showed no hotter than without it. I am so happy I bought this!"
4,Ahhh... old punk,"Dead Boys "" Young Loud and Snotty"" is a really good old punk record. The name of this album is exactly what it is... Young Loud and Snotty! This is an album that you can listen to straight through... no tracks that you need to skip. Buy it today!"
3,"yeah, punk, whatever...","looks like punk, sounds like punk, but its just there. about half of this is good silly misogynist fun, but the rest is totally disposable misogynist tripe. sexism is especially stupid when there's poor music behind it. as for the band, pretty run of the mill. for all stiv's iggy-esque posturing, he has a voice slightly better than gg allin (speaking of mr. allin, as i prefer to call the [...] goof, wanting to outdo iggy pop in outrageousness is your choice, but iggy had something to contribute musically, which is why funhouse & raw power are stone classics whereas this is just ehhhh). as for cheetah chrome's guitar work (because who cares about jimmy zero-oh great punk name there, [...]), gimme brian james of the damned anytime. sonic reducer, all this and more, hey little girl, and caught with the meat in your mouth (such gentlemen!!) are great, burn the rest."
4,Punk Classic,"This album appeared the same year as the Sex Pistols' Never Mind The Bollocks and is in the same league. But the sound here is more varied and the lyrics more poetic, like on the harrowing slow song Betrayal Takes Two with its intricate guitar work. My favorites include the subversive tour de force Love Comes In Spurts, the anthemic title track and the melodic song The Plan, while others are interesting. Different avenues of rock are explored - it's more than just angry 3-minute anthems. Unfortunately the album isn't consistently good, it has its weaker moments. Five stars for historical importance, three stars for the music."
4,Works fine,"It was a bit difficult to install as the card slots on my mother board are configured differently, and this fit in the slot that was hard to get to. The instructions were scanty at best, but I was able to figure it out and the card works fine."
3,decent sound,While this has decent sound it doesn't seem much different from the sound from the internal chips in our newer computers. If you need a sound card it isn't bad but I'd not call it an upgrade to an existing internal sound chip.
1,Sent it back,I had a static from the time I installed it. I worked with a tech from Creative (who was very helpful) for a couple of weeks but in the end we could not eliminate the static. Back it went.
1,Incomplete hardware,"I am unable to test the card as there was no bracket with which to secure it to the computer. Responses from Creataive and Amazon were unsatisfactory. I have a Dell Optima 520S which is narrower than standard desktops but a very popular model. The response of ""o look on the internet for the bracket"" is not going to encourage me to make another purchase from Creative or Amazon."
3,Works well enough,"I needed a cheap sound card, this worked fine. For whatever reason, a lot of the software and features that came with it didn't work."
1,Blue screened my machine,Tried and tried to get this thing to work on an older machine that I had successfully upgraded to Windows 7. Got a blue creen every time even with updated drivers from Creative. Finally went to Fry's and bought a $20.00 card that worked perfectly.
5,Great tool for new teachers!,"As a new teacher this year, one of the most frustrating things was finding a way to keep my lessons together. Jim Burke's book not only gives a place to organize my lesson plans and reflect upon them, but also useful tools for every aspect of my life. There are sections that remind me to access the other parts of my life besides teacher, and sections to help focus on individual student attention. I also like that there are different sections to keep lists of administrators, substitutes, and sick days. If my book ever went missing, I would feel lost without it! Thanks for making my first year a whole lot easier!"
2,NOT for the Elementary Teacher,"I titled my review ""NOT for the Elementary Teacher"", but I can't see that there is enough planning room for teachers at any grade level. I sent it back the moment I noticed that there are only a few boxes of planning space for each day. I WISH Amazon would show the planning blocks on the preview. It would have saved me from ordering it in the first place. OFTEN times when I try to preview a planbook on Amazon, the planning pages are not shown. HELLO AMAZON--That is what we need to see in order to make an accurate choice. IF the book had had the proper planning space, I would have kept it, but back it went the next day. Guess I have to go back the the ""cutesy"" ones that are made for elementary teachers, as if WE are in elementary school!"

5,Shakespeare is for children too!,"Shakespeare is for kids and adults in E. Nesbit's creative mind. I always liked fairy tales, but I couldn't read Shakespeare very well. In Children's Shakespeare E. Nesbit turned his work into fairy tales without changing the story and morals. This book is not much like Nesbit's other books because it was written by Shakespeare, but I bet there are some simularities.This book was a overall well writen book and I beleive E. Nesbit put a lot of hard work into her books in her life-time. I'm sure if she were alive now she would still be writing good books to this day."
3,factual information surrounded by cliched putdowns,"A fast moving video with excellent computerized visuals and explanations make fitness physiology understandable! Unfortunately Covert's sense of humor relies on attempts to mimic ethnic groups, putdowns, and trite one liners, which may be offensive to some listeners."
4,Twisted Album!!,"The Boredoms are one of those bands that no one knows about - they are a super twisted band from Japan (where else?) - ""Onanie Bomb Meets Sex Pistols"" is hard listening but well worth owning as it's such an insane album , and i love the album cover!"
2,Who is Flowtech targeting with their marketing?,"First, the marketing & their product names??!? What's with all the bright colors & simple catch-phrases, it's enough for me. I felt like I was buying something from Mattel or even a children's cereal. I'd be embarassed if I was working for them.Now, the product itself is black as the ace of spades, mild steel. what struck me was the weight, it's literally twice as heavy as the DynomaxVT of similar shape/size. You could use this as a potato cannon better than a muffler, however with all of these points that I don't like, it's still a very well made muffler."
3,"important story, plain language","When I started reading this book for my book club, I thought it had been translated from French, as the language was very plain-I don't know how else to say it. In some cases, this is a good thing. In this case, I thought it detracted from the book. It certainly held my attention and I am glad I was able to learn some history about which I had been ignorant. The rest of my bookclub would have given the book a much lower rating, but the story was compelling so I rated it higher."
2,smeelllllyyyy!,"these treats are great in the fact that our dog loved em and they are low calorie, however we couldn't buy em again - they smell horrible. sometimes our friends were over and would also comment on the putridity. wish i had known that before we bought em so wanted to warn you before you buy. dogs may love em but our noses did not."
3,A Unique Experience,"This CD should only be purchased if you already own at least three of the following Yanni CD's: Devotion, Reflections Of Passion, Live At The Acropolis, and Tribute. Otherwise, you're cheating yourself out of a true Yanni experience. That being said, most Yanni fans will eat this one up. True, most of the instrumentation is tinny and dated, but those who look beyond the surface will find some very unique and pleasing melodies. This compilation really represents a side of Yanni that few are able to see in his newer albums, and it's definitely worth a look. Also, why ""You Only Live Once"" isn't included on any of his ""Greatest Hits"" albums is a mystery to me. Make sure that you hear this song one way or another. If you have a little cash and are already familiar with Yanni then pick this one up."
4,Interesting take on a classic short story,Loaded with extras. My favorite was Alec Baldwin's sonorous and varied reading of the original Stephen Benet short story. We get the full 106 minute version here. Most of the material cut for release seems to deal with the farmers' efforts to unionize. The best addition to the original tale is French actress Simone Simon (Cat People) who is criminally sexy as a temptress sent by the Devil (Walter Houston).
2,Soundtrack Bad,"Yes I did buy this DVD in hopes of fulfilling a childhood memory. But like other reviewers I found much fault in the soundtrack. In watching the movie I kept having to turn the volume down or up. The score jumped from a fever pitch to nothing audiable. I was afraid the neighbores upstairs would complain about the sudden blast. I no longer believe that Criterion is a wonderful company that comes out with 'special produced DVD'S. And their prices are much too high for what it really is. Sincerly, Robert L. Anderson"
1,It's not Trance,"Very dissappointing. I thought it would be trance. It's not. It's the type of music they play when models come down the catwalk. It does get a little better towards the end, but it still stinks."
2,Yuck,"Although I love Oakenfold, this cd is not very good. The music dates itself and it's very simplistic and generally awful..I tried to get into it without success. The worst."
3,It is great,"The CD was great mood music, I love the lyrics and the best part about the band is that one of the members is my earth science teacher and she rocks!"
1,Beware of this Disc,"Just a note the ""Dual Disc"" is something to beware of. Just got the disc in & put it in my computer to play as I was working, locked up my whole machine. Also won't play on my Pioneer DVD player in my living room. Only buy this disc if you like throwing money away or want to have to buy a special junky CD player for the ability to listen to what you spent your money on."
1,"I WANT CLASS IN COUNTRY MUSIC, NOT TRASH","A friend had this CD and I borrowed it out of curiousity. I couldn't believe people would buy this. I want a good role model to look up to. Gretchen Wilson is not a good role model for anyone aspiring to a good, moral life. Heaven help the future if we have role models like Gretchen Wilson around. This CD and its music (lyrics and music) is thisclose to being X rated!"
5,The Redneck Woman is back!,"This album is awesome! I have been a fan of Gretchen's music since her first hit Redneck Woman. I think this was an excellent follow up to her first album ""Here For The Party"". My favorite songs on this album are definetly ""All Jacked Up"", ""One Bud Wiser"", and ""Politically Uncorrect"", however, all of the other songs on here are really good too. This album is definetly some of her best work! If you like Gretchen Wilson, I would highy encourage you to buy this CD!"
1,gretchen wilson,"I wish there was a 0 star selection. That's what I think of this album! ""skoal ring"" and ""one bud wiser""...oh please. I hear the 3rd time's a charm!"
5,Great product when you need a longer dryer cord,The big box stores don't sell dryer cords longer than 6 feet . I wanted to re-arrange my laundry room but moving the 220 receptacle wasn't an option. This was the solution! This cord was as good quality as any sold in the big box stores and cost significantly less online.
3,Hemo,This video has not aged well. It was great in the 60's but the host is smoking a cigarette as the film begins. Some of the science is incorrect and the religious ending is over the top.
3,hemo the magnificent/unchained goddess,"Dvd was defective, the seller gave me a refund, and I""m gonna take this dvd to a place in arizona that fixes dvd's."
5,Awesome!,"This game is really fun. I had the ""feel the magic"" game and wanted this one, which is the first one. It's a great game!"
1,Way too hard!!,"i thought that games are supposed to gradually get more difficult as you go from level to level, not just be difficult all around. i played for about 5 min and hated it!! i thought that it had potential and seemed somewhat unique, but what's the point when you can't get anywhere?"
2,Too HARD!!!!!,"The stages on this game are way too hard. They expect you to aim a blowgun and blow into the mic at the same time. You can't see where you are aiming and even if you aim in the right place, it won't acknowledge your hit and you miss. One of the stages is mostly luck. The stampede stage totally sucks. They expect you to tap a thousand hearts on the screen in 3 seconds. The controls are sluggish too. You could be tapping exactly where they want you too and they will not acknowledge it. Unless I can find a cheat code to skip these rotten stages, this is the most disappointing sequel I have ever played."
4,"Great production, interesting story, worth it.","I love an anime that is well drawn. A well produced anime is rare. The Sky Crawlers is one of those artistic gems. The rendering of the sky, the airplanes, their dog fights was breathtaking. I simply did not think it was possible for an anime to come to rival that of an action film, but it did. Holy gerbil, you got to see to believe it.The animation of the people, on the other hand, pales in comparison. The story, although engaging, is a bit slow and dull at times.Overall, watch for the beautifully rendered aerial dog fights and the wonderful propeller fighters/bombers. Skip the rest if you like."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I was a huge fan of Ghost in the Shell. That film, along with Cowboy Bebop, was what got me into anime.So imagine my disappointment with Oshii's Sky Crawlers. I wasn't expecting a movie all about air combat, as implied by the title and the excellent opening shootout, but I was expecting something that would hold my attention like a pair of meathooks. What followed was an interesting, but slow-paced and ultimately boring film with a fairly predictable conclusion. If it could be called that.Oshii's Ghost in the Shell was an intelligent balance of style and substance, action and thought-provoking dialogue. It was one of those movies that stayed with you, gave you something to think about.The Sky Crawlers attempts to create this same feeling, but I don't feel like it quite made the cut."
1,Sadly one of the worse anime I've ever seen!,"This is no Miyazaki, this is not nausicaa, this is not even close to a ""D"" rated movie. The animation is good, but the story is, well, just not there. The story is not well developed and it drags and drags and drags to complete boredom. By the time the movie ends all you'll want is a refund of your time. Not worth watching, much less buying."
2,Disappointed,"had a few good scenes but in general was disappointing, i had expected more based on the trailers i had seen before about this movie"
3,"Great aerial scenes, slow land scenes","Having procrastinated buying this every since I first saw a trailer on an HD TV at a local department store; I finally took the plunge and bought it. The aerial scenes were fantastic, plus the voices were dubbed in English. It was worth the price just for this. It was the 5 Star SKY portion.However, this fraction of the animation was not enough to make up for the flat animation in the ground scenes which were still in Japanese. I couldn't wait for them to get back into the pilot's seat and take off again. This was the 1 Star CRAWLER portion, hence only 3 stars. Maybe, just maybe, it would have spiced up the ground scenes if they had dubbed them in English too.Sorry if that sounds chauvinistic."
4,Almost perfect,"Like others agree, the songs are very diverse yet fit this movie perfectly. It is nice to have such great variety and some quality songs of all genres. However I do agree with the reviewer below me. The score featured throughout the movie (a sad and beautiful acoustic guitar feel) should be featured on this soundtrack because it added a lot to the movie and should be with the other scores. I have been looking for this score also because I really liked it ever since I saw the movie two something years ago. So that is my only complaint. These collection of songs are a pleasure to listen to."
4,Good CD,"If you enjoy Steve Lawrence singing, this is a good CD. The only problem I have with it is that at the ending of some of his songs, he is stopped suddenly. The music is good, but I guess in order for as many songs as is on it (which is 31), some of the songs were not allowed to be played out totally, they were just abruptly cut. That said; however, I have enjoyed the music."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"I was very impressed with the author's 'HTML for the World Wide Web: Visual QuickStart Guide,' so I started 'XML for the World Wide Web' with great enthusiasm. The opening chapters were clear, concise, and easy to follow. Unfortunately, as the book continued, I found the examples more difficult to decipher. There are two web sites supporting the book, but I found neither site answered my questions to any degree of satisfaction. The examples used are poorly explained, much to my surprise. I would suggest tracking down tutorial sites on the web as a primary source of information instead of starting with this text."
3,"Useful, but the first edition is very outdated","This is a decent reference guide, but uncomfortably out of date. While the author keeps her site updated for latest changes, why buy a book when you need to read the most up to date info online anyway? The book is an excellent bargain, but a free online tutorial (on oreilly for example) is a much better deal. The best intro to XML book I've read is still Beginning XML (WROX--wait for the 3rd edition if you can, the 2nd edition is still more recent and more useful than the VQ guide)."
2,Shakespeare catfish rod too flimsy,I bought this rod for exactly what it is supposed to be for...catfishing. It turns out that although it is long enough for long casts it is way too weak to do it. It is also very awkward to retrieve a large fish with it as it flexes so much. If you really want a rod that will do well from Shakespeare look at the Ugly Stik Tiger or Tiger Lite. These rods are well worth the extra money and still very affordable.
5,Ordering our THIRD copy because we've worn the first 2 out!,"You heard right - our third copy! As far as my husband and I are concerned, no Native American artist can compare to Robert Mirabal. No other artist moves you the way he does. No one else writes lyrics and music that bring out feelings like he does. And his performances are better than anyone I've ever seen - of any genre.This isn't your ""father's"" music - this is a cultural breakthrough for the Native American community - one that should have been a crossover long before country made the crossover move. If you haven't heard his music, you have no idea what you're missing, or how his music can move you - over and over!"
3,Middle of the Road,Purchased this spray because it was on sale and I needed a new fragrance. This is a nice fragrance that is definitely not over bearing or offensive. So it can be worn to church and to work. Very feminine and romantic. Any man kissing you on the neck or ear will like this.
3,some repeats,"this was a good set, but repeated in one of the other ""pacs"" i got online. Wish they had listed the movie titles on the web so I could see that I was ordering duplicates the 2 orders...that was disappointing. but passed them on to the Library so they could be shared with lots of people!``"
5,Lifetime Movies Collector's Set V. 2,"I enjoyed all 4 movies. I like to watch movies that are based on true stories. Sad and when you felt like there was no hope, something happens.I gave the DVD 5 Star rating."
4,Only on Amazon,"My Dad saw these guys play in a very famous book/cd store in Seattle in 1997 and loved them, of course he purchased the album then and there. 6 months later we were ramstacked, and amoungst the items stolen was the Muzzle CD. Do you think we can find it here in Australia? NO! We couldn't even find it in Seattle on our return in 1999/2000, the band was that popular.I was thrilled to finally find a copy on Amazon after years of searching (yes I had tried Amazon before).The only thing I was worried about was whether or not my Dad would still like them.The short answer to my long story is my Dad still LOVES Muzzle.Just have to find their website now."
3,Barely wetted the appetite.......,"Book was a disappointment. Each chapter was more like a snippet, a little nibble, a brief overview of the writer's experiences. I'm assuming this, because, surely traveling would provide for a wide and broad spectrum of experiences to share....but not here, too bad."
4,Whoa. The Roc is in the building!,"Roc-A-Fella proved that they are easily one of the biggest empires in the music business. And with recruits like Kanye West and Just Blaze as their producers, things get even hotter. And with Diplomats dropping their double-disc debut earlier this year, State Property was the next group up to drop THEIRS. And trust me, they dropping them flames on this. The lead single ""Can't Stop, Won't Stop"" by Young Gunz is straight flames and the first track on the album. But I am not about to review each song, song for song. Though some key tracks are...""It's On"", ""Temporary Relief "", ""Still In Effect"", ""When You Hear That""...well basically the whole album. But trust me, if you a roc-a-fella fan, or not, you still gotta cop this. Straight heat."
2,Ummmmm......... Yeah!!!,"Being from Philly you'd think I'd Ride State Prop right off the bat right??? Naw, this album I am finding it very hard to listen to. After the first one banged in my CD player with the windows down in winter for over a year, this one makes me keep the windows up and the stereo on mute for the majority of the cuts!! Besides for ""it's on"" and a few of PEEDI's cuts, the album is lacking the Roc-a-fella touch. Where's the step stool that brings Roc to anothr level? This album was a step backwards and I am really dissappointed in Sparks. Young Froggy is a killa with his raspy voice and unusual delivery, but left me aching for more of that raw coming off a 3rd verse high on ""Sing my Song"" off the first album. Bottom line, yeah the cd looks nice on the shelf to hold a spot in my collection of Roc CD's but you'll rarely find it in the cd tray!!"
5,Chabon is still the best...,"This is the last Chabon book that I've read (even though it was his first) and he consistently proves himself a genius in my eyes. The only negative thing I ever hear anyone say about Chabon is that there's not really a plot to his books. That is not the point! He is simply a joy to read - extremely funny and moving at the same time. The story, as it is, concerns Art Bechstein: the son of a gangster. One explosive summer, he falls in with a Hemmingway-esque crowd of beautiful people. Together, they discover their ""will to bigness"" and have many amazing adventures together, until it all comes crashing down.I believe that this is Chabon's shortest novel. It's truly a breeze to read. Totally original and it will leave you wanting more."
2,No Wonder Boys,"I found this book to be very well written. Chabon is a brilliant writer but I didnt care for the lead character. I agree with one review that stated his venture in homosexuality was cliched and predictable. Cahbon did the same thing to another troubled youth in Wonder Boys (Much better book, I loved it.)Unlike James Leer, Art is too much of a wimp and a loser and he is just not very interesting. If Chabon wasnt so brilliant or if the book was written by another writer, no one would have paid much attention"
2,"No, thanks.","I am sure there are people, maybe a lot of people, who like this sort of writing. Personally, I find it almost precious. What I found here is writing to show off -""the broken back of a lemon wedge"" - what does that evoke? Nothing, to me. I have not read any of his other work, and I have no intention of doing so. Give me Hemingway over this overwritten dreck."
4,Coming-of-age with a twist,"Michael Chabon's hit the big time since he won the Pulitzer for Kavalier and Klay, but this lovely earlier book of his is also very good. Not always straightforward, sometimes confusing, often kind of depressing, always loving and charming - that's how I'd describe The Mysteries of Pittsburg. The young people populating this book are wonderfully drawn, and most of the time I felt I was being pulled right into their world as they tried to figure it out for themselves. A great little book, and a pretty fast read."
3,Freely borrowed ideas from other people in Pgh.,"This book is not bad. The author freely borrowed ideas from others in Pgh. that were part of a ""scene."" The characters names were actually real nicknames (i.e. ""mau mau) of people from the scene. But that is how good fiction is made, from borrowing from real life events."
3,"Great first novel, flaws and all","Michael Chabon's ""Mysteries of Pittsburgh"" holds up well next to his other, more established novels, including ""Wonder Boys"" and ""Kavelier and Klay"". It really does. It's not a perfect novel--the implausibility of the characters' actions and their dialogue clang dissonantly. At times, you want to slap his characters for making the wrong choice, being immature, saying something overly fanciful, or just being too apparently well-read and smart. But then you realize that this is how just-graduated college students often do act, how they often do talk, and that they often are well-read. This is a well-written coming-of-age story that does feel like a throwback to the '50s, though its set in the 80s, which is why (I think) that so many made the connection to ""Catcher in the Rye""."
4,Giovanni's Room in Panther Hollow?,"Vivid writing makes this an enjoyable and sometimes enlightening read.It is virtually impossible to forget Chabon's well-wrought imagery, especially for me the Panther Hollow Cloud Factory, which I saw every day as a little boy while my dad was in graduate school at the University of Pittsburgh. But I never appreciated it until Chabon described it.My only hesitation is this novel's uncanny similarity to James Baldwin's novel, Giovanni's Room. Except for the method of death (guillotine vs. motorcycle accident) and the different locale (Paris vs. Pittsburgh), plot, characters and character development run almost the exact same course. I've never seen commentary on this, but I have to ask, just how much is The Mysteries of Pittsburgh an artful rewrite of Giovanni's Room?"
2,Hardcore fans/collector's only,"I bought this on an impulse 'cause I wanted to give ACID MOTHERS TEMPLE a shot, but this was a wrong move on my part. What we have here is a bootleg-quality recording of one of their lives shows in the US. The sound is just awful, and is a pretty crappy representation of the band, so this is one only for collector's or someone who was at the show.Basically, don't do what I did. Start with something that's well-liked by fans like IAO CHANT FROM THE COSMIC INFERNO.EDIT: After some consideration I bumped this up a star 'cause this does have a certain amount of value for the initiated, plus I like the band a bit more at this point."
5,The Girl who deserves a parade,"This is a terrific album from Jill Sobule. Pink Pearls's focus is on ordinary life that is off-kilter. Sobule has made this album insightful and humourous. Sobule has made an art form of highlighting the obvious and her tales of modern life, while barbed, salvage the process of living it. The stand out tracks are 'Rainy Day Parade', 'Heroes', 'Loveless Hotel' and 'One Of These days'. Her music is always compassionate and funny - for if you didn't laugh at our creeping californian consumerist lifestyles - you'd cry. Laugh along as Jill reminds us to get back on our medication - and this album is just the tonic for post-modern relief. Highly recommended!"
5,Be like Che,"Kudos to the Pathfinder editors for finding Saldaña and recording his story before he died. Saldaña describes the day-to-day life of revolutionary organizers among workers and peasants in Bolivia in the early 1960s. The book gave me a deeper appreciation for the revolutionary possibilities that existed in Bolivia, which in turn led to Che opening the guerrilla front there in 1966."
3,Good Live Action,"Okay, why does Amazon, place a non-ANIME film into the ANIME section??? Although this film(s) collection is sort of good, with a somewhat good story. But is it on the level of the Lone Wolf and Cub level Series NO WAY CLOSE.It reminds me of a made-for-tv-movie, which it probabely was by Japanese standards. One scene has a woman raped, which make the rating R, due to person being raped exposing her breasts. NOT FOR KIDS....The sword play is nice, not allot of blood, not like on the level of other Japanese films.Anyways, if you are thinking of buying it as ANIME like Basilisk is.. This isn't that at all. SOOOOO DON'T BUY IT."
2,D'Oh!,"Made the unfortunate mistake of buying this under the impression it had something to do with Basilisk or Shinobi: Heart Under Blade. Wrong and wrong again. This is hand cam ninja soap opera. Interesting, but ultimately not too good and definately NOT what I was hoping it would be."
1,Character assassination of Lincoln!,"The author has a subjective agenda to discredit one of the greatest men to ever grace this planet! 'Tis pity he spoils the purported object of the book by forcing the reader to constantly wade through his bias against Lincoln to get to some admittedly riveting revelations about the Government conspiracy to ""Execute"" him. As ever, money is the root of that evil.He would have been better served by writing two books...though one of them would not be even a ""good"" seller."
5,A Match Made in Heaven,"I had the great fortune to see one of my heros of musical theatre on Broadway in a role that has been waiting for her. Bernadette Peters is such a forceful personality, without Merman's brassiness that can often times be grating. When she is paired with Sondheim, she is unstoppable. In this musical, she shines as the sexiest Mama Rose to date. Of course I may be biased, Sondheim just happens to be one of my favorite composers/ lyricist ever (and no, he is not a copycat of Sir Andrew because Lloyd Webber doesn't write in the complicated time signatures and difficult tempos that are hallmarks of Sondheim's work)."
1,Buggy! The .exe fails. The hardware does not stay in. AVOID!,"AVOID! Don't buy it! Don't let your kids buy it. The dongle does not stay in the DS. My son held it in place as the DS is sprung to push it out. The software kept failing and sending error reports to Microsoft. I tried it on two laptops. One was used for about six months. The other is nearly new with a fresh install and complete updates.Even if the software worked, the hardware not locking into the DS is a show stopper. Its Junk!All in all, the worst piece of game software I have ever seen. My son, who had waited five days for this to come in, was heartbroken.We are just going to throw it out."
2,Mine Melted!!!,"Like a lot of people have said, this is a lot of fun, for a while, then it breaks, my particular issue was the codes vanished and when i tried to put them back on the action replay claimed it was filled with codes, but it was empty. After leaving it plugged into my computer for maybe five minutes the action replay began to melt! Needless to say ive given up with this peice of junk and can't imagine i will get a new one."
1,"Didn't work, so we sent it back","We purchased two of these for two different kids. Neither one of them worked. When we plugged them in, we would just get a white screen. I tried to contact the manufacturer to see if there was a solution to this problem, and they never responded. So, we sent them back."
1,Don't You Dare!,"Don't even THINK about buying this. I'm disgusted with you. You call yourself a gamer? Or a Pokemon Trainer? A real gamer / Pokemon Trainer would know better than to buy CHEATING DEVICES! Don't deny it, you know it's true. Be a good person. Don't buy this. Think of the Pokemon that have been hurt by these things. We can stop this! If you want an advantage on your games, buy an official strategy guide from Nintendo Power or Prima. Anything with a Nintendo Seal is fine. Now I want you to take that mouse or track pad of yours and close out this product detail window. Just close it. Now. It's the right thing to do. So do it. Gotta Catch 'em All! (without cheating)"
5,Action Replay is Very Cool,My Action Replay arrived very fast.I am Pleased with the Product and Overall Very Happy !Anthony from Dallas
1,didnt work with our ds lite,"i assume this an 'ok' product, if you can get it to work.it didnt work in our ds lite game system. we are very dissapointedit was a waste of money."
5,This rocks!!!,The Action replay is excellent for getting codes you wouldn't get otherwise. We use it for all sorts of games. My kids won't play their DS without it.
2,Bleargh,"This action replay is more brittle then glass. It breaks easily, and is very hard to use if you have windows vista. The code manager only works for windows xp. Meh."
3,It's awesome until it ruins your game,"I bought this because some of my friends had them. I loved when I got it. I could run through walls, never die, and do anything I wanted. It worked great too. It only has one problem. It has a tendency to mess up your game. It will freeze if you mess the game up too much. If you get really unlucky like I did it will ruin the game to the point where you can't play anymore. Other than that it works fine. I would have given it 5 stars but after it ruined my game which I had wasted 100+ hours on it got 3."
2,Cheap Junk,"I was starting to get bored on having to complete a whole game by itself so I got the action replay for DS. It was great except I had absolutely no idea how to download more codes (maybe in the instructions it'll say). Just when I was about to use my action replay again, it broke. All the codes were completely erased from the AR and I couldn't download anymore codes (it didn't allow me to). Overall, fun at the beginning but then turns into useless junk I just really want to rip in half!P.S. this product is a money waster!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Kids loved it,I bought this for the use of me three boys who have been delighted with it.Had no problem downloading updates and new info but the interface isn't simple enough for my children (all under 9 years to use)In use it works well but do check that theres enough of the games you own listed as there aren't that many other links available.
1,Getting it to work is a nightmare,"I bought this product not too long ago (just got it today) and not only does my computer not detect it, I couldn't even get the drivers to install. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, looked online for help, updated it... it just wouldn't detect it at all.This would all be fine and dandy, but it actually broke because it's so cheaply made. Yes, the place where you plug the USB cord in is broken, pretty much leaving me with nothing but a useless cord and card.I paid way too much for such a, well, crappy product. I expected something better for my $25. I'm so happy that it works for other people, but don't bother with it if you have Windows 7, or if you mind that it's going to break insanely easily. I'd send it back, but instead I am going to put it on my wall to remind me not to buy garbage like this again."
3,Oops!,I was so excited when I heard the mail had come. I looked inside the package and I found the CD and the action replay. But I got ready to play it and noticed that there was no cord! You can look at the pictures and see that there was a cord. I was wondering what had happened. Is it supposed to come with a cord? Do I have to buy one online? I don't know anywhere near here that sells them. And what do I do with the disk? It didn't come with a manual or instructions.
3,DS cheats enabled,The kids both have one of these gadgets and they use them often. It allows them to access many cheat codes on many games. The mario kart and pokemon series gain many benefits from this tool. I have noticed that the card fits better into some DS's than it does in others. Occasionally there are errors that come out of the unit but not too bad. There is a USB dongle that is used to update the software from a computer. This is a must have for the game upgrade to work correctly. All in all a good bargain and two keep the kids from fighting over them. :)
1,no good,"I bought this game and just as said in all the other bad reviews it did not work properly. I couldn't put in any of the codes off my pc. You could use the cheats that were already programmed in to it, but soon found it messed up the game. There was not a phone # to call, not in this country anyway.I spent hours trying to figure out this and it was useless. It was very frustrating and would advise against buying."
1,Don't waste your money,Game never worked called company never was able to speak w/live person left messages no call backs. Also sent two e-mails no response. Junk
4,Disappointing,"My son loved the product, until it broke and no longer would work, we tried redownloading it and nothing worked, we are sending back for a replacement hoping the new one works better."
3,Gift for Mom,"This was a gift for my Mom for Christmas and she liked it. I remember watching it when I was really young on TV, it was different than I rememberd it."
4,letters everyone should read,"Being a kid of a mere seventeen years old, I must admit the prospect of marraige seems a little bit scary. However, marraige seems like it would be easier after reading this book. I would definitely reccommend it for anyone who is considering a leap into the world of matrimony. It gives answers regarding questions im sure that everyone has asked themselves at one time or another. How should I treat my wife in public? Should she be the one doing all the housework? How can i make her feel special? And most importantly, How does God fit into our relationship? Letters to Philip is fatherly wisdom at its finest."
2,Fail,"Fail Packs, and I bought 5 of them of varying sizes, have failed by freezing solid making them difficult to apply. Out of 5, 4 are rock solid when frozen. Most leak blue stuff, although I cannot say if I punctured them or it is a failure on the Versa Packs side. Seeing as most are leaking, I doubt that I holed them all.And as I ordered online, cannot return them. Not happy at all with these."
1,Not what I expected.,"I'm really disapointed with this version of the Iliad. This version uses the Roman names for all the gods in the book. This makes it so confusing to figure out who is who I just stopped reading the book. I would return it but it would cost just as much to ship it as the book costs, so there's no point in doing that."
4,Romance is alive and well,"With Old Friends I finally heard an artist that has painted a musical masterpiece. Five step Tango should be heard all over, an unusual song that touches a nerve. Cocktail Time is a fun tune should be played in every bar after work. We live on Borrowed Time is a classic that reminds us to Live every day and enjoy. I LOVE this CD"
2,Why are all the vampires bad?,Perhaps it's me. I just don't understand why all vampires have to be bad. This book was okay. It was written with a very open end for a sequel. Touch on the religious side.
1,midnight mass,This is one of the least interesting books that I have read from this author. I lost interest after the first two chapters.I do like a plausable plot and this book doesn't deliver.
3,"Battery life was terrible, not that bright","I got this item hoping for some bright light but thought it fell short. Also, the battery seemed to only last 20 minutes or less. I let it charge for quite some time too. I returned it right away."
5,Elegant writing,Mr Hiaasen writes with effortless elegance and a keen eye for the absurd.His passion for Florida shines through in his novels and columns.
3,"Ehhhh, Ok.","This book was light and kept my attention but I would never attempt to call it complelling literature. It was an easy read, nothing intellectual or shocking. In fact, it was quite predictable but will entertain you well enough."
5,Won't be a Secret Much Longer!,"Sophie Kinsella does it again. If you love the Shopaholic Series you will love Can You Keep a Secret.Kinsella introduces a new character, Emma, to us in this great book. Emma, while on a plane which seems to be on its way down feels the need to spill all her long lost secrets to the man sitting next to her, before she dies. Needless to say the plane doesn't crash and Emma is embarassed but finds solace in the fact that she will never see that man again.... or will she...Back to reality Emma at work one day happens upon that very man in the office... and he happens to be her new BOSS!This book is so fun. Kinsella has a way of penning such loveable characters, and Emma is no exception."
1,I just don't get it ...,"After suffering through the first nine pages of CYKS, I gave up. I'd by now started to hate Emma with a passion, and couldn't care less about what might or might not happen to her.I just don't get this new genre of ""chicklit"" in which Bridget Jones and the Sex in the City women reign. I love to read novels with women as the protagonists, but just don't understand the popularity of the characters created by Helen Fielding, Marian Keyes, Jane Green, Sophie Kinsella, and whoever wrote Sex in the City. I just cannot respect these women - I find them ditzy, scatterbrained, insecure, and pathetic.Clearly, I'm missing something."
5,Confessions of a Shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella,"Loved the book. It was a can't put it down experience. Have read 4 of Sophie Kinsella's books and found them all to be wonderful! Purchased four books from one Amazon vendor and received only 2. Amazon refunded the entire cost and I kept the two books. Need to order the two that did not arrive now... Remember Me? and Can You Keep a Secret? Have read & recommend Shopaholic ties the Knot, Confessions of a Shopaholic, The Undomestic Goddess and Shopaholic takes Manhattan. I want to read all of the books she has written and those yet to come. Shopaholic Ties the know was the first Sophie Kinsella book for me..... a used gift from a friend who had finished reading it."
4,Foot in Mouth ...,"Can You Keep a Secret?I'm new to Sophia Kinsella's books. Can you believe it? I haven't been living under a rock, just finishing my own click lit comedy which came out on Kindle last week. I've also spent a lot of time with Stephanie Plum.I felt pain for Emma as she hopped around with her foot in her mouth. I guess she forgot her mother's warnings to never speak to strangers. They might turnout to be your boss. It's a fun read.Barbara SilkstoneThe Secret Diary of Alice in Wonderland, Age 42 and Three-QuartersThe Secret Diary of Alice in Wonderland, Age 42 and Three-Quarters"
3,Could have saved money at cost co.....,"Saw Sophie Kinsella books at Cost Co, and with shipping and handeling costs I could have done better just buying it there..... oh well, Amazon is good for things I can't find in stores!"
2,Not nearly as good as the Shopaholic series,"I'm a big fan of Becky Bloomwood and her Shopaholic adventures, but I thought Sophie Kinsella was coasting on her reputation in Can You Keep a Secret (and it appears to be working, given the number of rave reviews I'm seeing). I found Emma to be not-too-bright and not-too-interesting. Ditto for her love interest, who seems much too clueless to be a successful tycoon. Also, I had enjoyed the first-person perspective in Shopaholic, where we could get into Becky's wonderfully zany and creative mind. In this one, Emma never comes alive in a believable or sympathetic way. I agree with a previous reviewer that this book will disappoint those who expect both wit and intelligence in their chick lit."
5,Can you resist this book?,"I saw this on the new release section of my library. It's pick cover invites me to open and have a look. I open and read the jacket blurb, and that's all it takes for me to grab it home with me. Of course, I stopped by the front desk and check it out first. What a fantastic read it is. You can not have a bad day if you are reading this book. If you're in the slump, pick this one up. Works like magic as an ""upper""!"
2,Just okay...,"Sometimes I wonder if people are just afraid to go against the tide while giving a review. Why all the rave reviews for this story? Am I missing something? This is Confessions of a Shopahilic with a new title and different names. Let's review...-Wealthy male boss who is initially mistaken for stranger never to be seen again (check)- bumbling young female with big life lesson to learn (check)- quirky jusgemental friends with misguided loyalty (check)- a betrayal of trust passed off as a misunderstanding or a silly lack of communication (check)- a fully fleshed out herione falling for a guy that we never really get to know (check)Yep... It's all there! So, if you loved Confessions and you want to read the same story again then you are in luck! For $7.99 you can download it on your kindle and have it today (AGAIN)."
4,"witty, wicked and enchanting.......","Emma Corrigan is searching for a way to make her dreams come true, a great guy, a great job and real happiness. She manages to utterly destroy her chances for a promotion at her first opportunity. On her way home from her failed business meeting, she relates everything she regards as a personal failing to a stranger and the story takes off from there. What happens when all your personal secrets are no longer hidden away? Does it change who you are, does it change who your friends are or does it open new opportunities...? Kinsella is a witty, disarming author who wickedly enchants and humorously captivates in a story of the search for happiness, love and acceptance. This is a true joy to read!"
4,"Campy, fun, & predictable.","Actually it's 3 1/2 stars. This is the first book I've read by Kinsella and wasn't sure what to expect with the mixed reviews I've read (I always sort with lowest ratings!). I was surprised that I enjoyed it and that it reminded me a lot of Bridget Jones' Diary.Yes, it is campy, predictable, unrealistic, and shallow. However, it is also fun and quirky. I read to escape not compare lives....which is why I was able to enjoy it."
3,Not the best Kinsella representation,"I have read almost all of Sophie Kinsella's books, including this one twice. Though some parts of the book have redeeming qualities, overall this was not one of Kinsella's best. The part in the book when Jack goes on national TV is especially unbelievable. Who does that? In any case, if you are looking for an entertaining Kinsella read, stick to the Shopaholic series!"
2,AVERAGE CHICK LIT,"I have liked previous books by this author and heard good things about this book, so I thought I would enjoy it. I love chick lit and am always looking for a fun breezy book. I really did not care for ""Can You Keep a Secret""-overall I thought it was average. The characters never seemed real, the romance was never developed and felt fake at times, and it almost seemed like a long drawn out plot for a soap opera. A few parts made me laugh, but all in all I thought the plot to be very weak and unrealistic. I found myself sympathizing more for the dumped boyfriend than cheering on the new love interest. If you're looking for a light fluff book you can finish quickly without thinking, then I would pick this book. But I most likely will never read it again and I would recommed any of the Shopaholic novels over this one anyday."
3,Good but not great light reading,"I found it to be good but not great. The good part was that it didn't over dramatize anything and moved along at a swift pace and Emma's parents found our the truth about her cousin. Of course the ending turned out good too. The bad part was that it was really pretty predictable with the room mates . One is always a bitch, one is always very nice and the other fixes their problems."
5,One of the Best Chick Lit Books I have Read in Years,"After reading the Undomestic Goddess, I had to read some more books by Sophie Kinsella. Therefore, I picked up Can You Keep a Secret. This book has to be the best chick lit I have read since Bridget Jones Diary (and, btw, I have read a lot of chick lit). Emma is an absolutely charming character that has secrets that many of us twenty and thirtysomething women share. Her main love interest, Jack, is also a total hottie!!"
4,Summer Fun,"This book made me laugh out loud. A lot of fun to read at the beach. If you are looking for a flawless story line and characters with lots of depth -LOOK Elsewhere, but this is funny stuff."
5,Amazing read!,I couldn't put this book down! Absolutely loved the characters in this book and was intrigued by the two main characters. Well done!
5,Kept me laughing and crying!,"Wow! I read a lot of books and haven't had one entertain me as much as this one did for a long time. I laughed, I cried and I kept turning those pages. Great book!"
5,AWESOME READ,Ok I wasn't sure at all at first if I wanted to read this book but boy was I dumb to wait so long. This book is now on of my favorites. I can hardly wait until the movie comes out.Read it for sure you wont be disapointed.
1,Chicklit?,"I searched amazon.com for ""women's fiction"" and came across the hugely popular Sophie Kinsella. I'd read a few of her books in her Madeleine Wickham-avatar, and found them delightful. I figured I couldn't possibly go wrong with such rave reviews. Oh, what a disappointment I was in for. Can You Keep a Secret falls into every stereotype women have had to contend with for the last century or more. To me, chick-lit translates into stories about real women -- women who are strong and smart. What's interesting about a caricature of incompetent women who are incomplete without a husband/boyfriend/significant-other, and can think of nothing else? I know we're better than that!"
1,Can You Keep a Secret?,I bought paper back as i had a hard copy in Engalnd and wanted to continue reading while away... Big mistake the paper felt so horrible i didnt get to read the book until i came home...
4,can you keep a secret?,"I got it very quickly I have not got a chance to hear it yet. but it looks in good conditon, ""Thanks"""
2,Not Fabulous Despite Rave Review,"I guess I had super high hopes about this book because of the plethora of rave reviews...however, the book did not live up to its reviews. Honestly, the book had a cute plot, yet it could have been told in 200 pages not nearing 400. I felt some parts of the book just dragged! Needless to say I was happy when it was over."
3,Good....not great,"Throughtout ""Can You Keep a Secret"" I kept longing for Becky Bloomwood and her frazzled albeit funny life. ""Secret"" is a fast read, and I very much enjoy Kinsella's writing style. However, there just wasn't a real spark to keep me interested. In other words, it took me a long weekend to finish rather than simply a day devouring each page. I would recommend people iffy about this to wait for paperback."
5,Quick and fun read!,This book was very entertaining! Emma was an endearing character-if a bit silly at times. I loved the character of Jack Harper and how he drove Emma crazy with just a raise of an eyebrow or a look! I can easily see this book becoming a movie.
3,average,"I love the shopaholic series, and cuz of the author, i picked up this book as well. much to my dismay, i didn't enjoy this book at all. first of all, i want to know how did she get the job! mind you i am currently looking for jobs with a double degrees, and constantly having difficulties. But c'mon! she seriously lack the personality and confidence as a person who works for marketing!!Jack, well, the plot didn't convience about his affection towards Emma. Somehow, I find him as a sexual predator!!!! seriously, don't we all have heard enough about sexual harassment at work!?I would recommend all of the shopaholic series or even the undomestic goddess, but not this one"
3,"Light read, but not as entertaining as author's other stories","Just finished reading the Kindle version. I enjoyed the story and the writing style, but the characters lacked depth and credibility. The protagonist, Emma is the most believable character - young, naive, a bit flighty, and lacking in self-confidence, she is still idealistic and ready to find herself. Her ex-boyfriend, roommates, co-workers and parents are all one-dimensional, so I found myself not caring about them or their roles to play in the story. So many more entertaining chick-lit stories out there to read...wishing I had passed on this one."
3,Son loves racing.,"This is the newer Speed racer where the son's of ""our"" speed racer meet & race on a virtual track.my son loves the old & new Speed Racer/"
1,just a big advertisement for their clinic,"if you were looking for a how-to in treating this condition, look elsewhere. This book is nothing but a big advertisement for their clinic and a bunch of personal stories. Here is all they tell you: their technique is called the Five Penetrations of Life and it involves a finger, tampon, applicator with medicine, intercourse, or gynecologic exam. That's it. That's all they reveal. Not for people who neither have the time or money to fly to their clinic in New York."
1,other ways,"I have started to research these types of books as I have vestibulodynia. I got over the vaginismus by muddling through. It was 23 years before I was diagnosed, and it seems women in the US have had it worse than me because doctors found out about them and started to make their lives an even worse misery. I live with dyspareunia and I have lots of sex but not intercourse. Stop being a victim, it is doctors doing this to you. Guys love BJs. You can have a great sex life. Try alt.com and meet up with guys who don't want intercourse for whatever reason. There's a better world out there than these endless treatments. libberty@hotmail.co.uk"
4,great service,the dvd arrived quickly and was in the exact condition stated. my mom really enjoyed her gift.
4,Sex drugs and rock'n'roll... It's over.,"When I first played this album, I thought it was kindof overdone, the sounds not blending well and the vocals too frequent and random... however, humorous at times. After listening to it I got the feeling that Keoki made this mix as sortof a tribute to some old friends... drag queens trippin' balls, tweak'd out club kids, or heroin addicted fashion models... the drug vibe is very strong. If you fit the above, and you're into electro, then goshdarnit buy this album! Don't be fooled by the poor intro, the album really pick up and reaches it's 'climax' in the middle. Best tracks: Zombie Nation - Unload; Waldorf - You're My Disco (New Romantic Mix); Zombie Nation feat. Divine (God love her!) - Native Love."
4,Hotter than most Regencies and that was a good thing!,"With so many giving the basic plot here I do not feel compelled to write another synopsis. Basically i found this an erotic romance set in the Regency period - good plot and sexy characters that would compete with other erotic reads soundly. Perhaps some of the language used , for me seemed a little more like a contemporary - which might have caused me to not give a 5 star as others have, Also the depth of characters seemed a little less developed than I prefer for a true 5 star book. But I will look to find other Sahara Kelly books in the future when I am looking for something a little steamier!!"
4,A Modern Vampire Myth With Hints of Titans,"Pulido has taken the formula that has made The New Teen Titans (Wolfman and Perez) great. Using a ""child"" that has been ""greatly tormented"" (look for yourself), Chastity has weathered the odds of domestic violence, punk rockers and the machinations of a countess against a vampiric clan.Actionwise, this graphic novel is very much like most ""Chaos! Comics."" Gore, blood, fueds, and nearly naked women.Artwise, I believe the drawing, inking, coloring and pacing of the entire three issues deserves praise. It is clear and straight forward.Good enough to read and keep reading throughout."
1,IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,IT WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL. I WAS EXPECTING MORE OF DISCO TO BE ON THE CD. BUT IT WAS JUST A HORRIBLE CD.
5,Good Book,I am doing genealogy research and found out that an ancestor was in the Orphan Brigade. This book was highly recommended to help gain insight into the life of a soldier was during the Civil War.
4,illustrated history of American Railroads,"this entertaining book is filled with the little stories of the building of america's railroads.Filled with maps,photos,and sketches this book is a must read for anyone who loves the history tales of Railroading..."
5,Innovative and on its own!,"I continue to consider artist and Dj 'Sven Vath' as a futuristic and innovative artist together with artist Ralf Hildenbeutel here.Keeping originality in his music even today and in his selections that he makes in his season's mix series. 'Accident in Paradise' was my first album from him at the beginning of the 90's. A very active year talking about techno,ambient,chill-out,the trance europe express years etc..and inspirational for me as an artist!'The Harlequin ,Robot and Ballet Dancer' stands on its own even for today by it's beautiful rainbow of sound designs and electronica music .Listen to 'The Beauty and the Beast' for instance and you can listen for yourself why you can listen to this production even amongst today's aural world and productions out there.Another source of inspiration for me that continues even today from his cocoon recordings label and cocoonclub in Frankfurt!"
5,"Trains, Trains, Trains",We loved the colorful locomotives and the historic station in the background. My husband is a train collector and loved to wear his train shirts. This is LA at it's best.
1,this set from bcieclpise didn't draw me in like some of the others,"this collection of 10 horror movies from bcieclipse of b thru z grade horror movies just didn't grab me like the other sets did. most of the movies weren't up to the task of keeping me involved. i just didn't like this one and sold it very quickly after i watched it. still some may like it ,but you have been warned."
4,Barron's book on Head Vases,"Since it is out of print now, it is so much harder to find. Arrived a little shop-worn, but I was pleasantly surprised that they included loose snapshots of headvases, too. Do wish there was an updated book, but this is the best available at this time."
2,"poor reception, poor battery life","Even when y ou dont use the unit, the battery drains itself rapidly. Reception is poor overall. I even tried the antenna headphones. I gave up, cancelled my subscription. If anyone interested send an email, will sell for half the going price."
3,"Good product, defective, bad warranty service","I enjoyed my Inno greatly. But then after a couple of months, the screen went almost entirely dim. I was packaging it to send into warranty service and then when i dropped the box, it got a small crack on the screen cover (which has nothing to do with the dim screen). Even though the crack has no connection to the defective screen brightness, they will not repair it. I have to say, that they also wanted me to return it to the merchant where I purchased it because they do not like to do their own returns/repairs - so they really have an aversion to fixing bad devices. If you buy this, just hope that your model works perfectly for the long haul because their warranty service is nowhere near as good as other electronics companies."
2,poor signal quality,"I had high hopes for this unit for use in both walking and to transfer use in my car. Consistent signal quality is very poor. I was surprised and disappointed to find out that unless I use it in wide open spaces, this signal cuts out frequently making it very annoying to use. Trees, building, even small ones, and any type of hills and valleys interfere with signal, causing it to cut out.Thankfully, I only signed up for one year of service. After it expires I will use the unit for only MP3 files."
1,MP3 problem with INNO.,"I purchased the Inno last week and I have returned it for the third and final time. I downloaded songs to the unit and it showed that they were on there. I then pushed the MODE button to listen live, then pushed MODE again and the unit froze up. I took out the battery and restared it without success. I returned the unit and got a new one with the same results. I returned the second unit and thought 3 was a charm.WRONG. This time when I powered the unit up it froze on the XM symbol and would not go any further. I retured that one also. I am hoping for something better in the next year."
1,fatal flaw,"Although this unit works perfectly when turned on ... providing easy to use recording, mp3 playback, and excellent XM reception, it fails miserably when turned off. Turn it off, and it looks like it's off ... but it keeps doing something that eventually drains the battery. Pioneer technical folks told me that when the unit was not in use it was to be stored in the home docking station. How lame is that? They assured me that the unit was working perfectly. I tried to return the unit to Amazon, but it turned out to be a ""3rd Party Sale,"" so had to send it to the real vendor who promised to credit my card. We'll see. This unit is not ready for prime time."
5,Runner pleased with Inno!,"I read all the reviews on the Inno before purchasing as well as visited quite a few mall kiosks inquiring about the piece and I have to say that this has been the best purchase of the season. We had the Delphi MyFi and had so many problems that we even considered cancelling our service, but not now. We don't have a need for the Antenna headphones. We can sit anywhere in our home and have reception for live XM! We even run on trails and haven't lost reception. I can use all my same home kit pieces from my Delphi. The only negative thing I have about it is that you have to have the car docking kit to use the FM Modulator in your vehicle. If that is incorrect, please someone let me know. I have the car kit for my Delphi, but I never had to plug it into anything, just adjust my station. I say if you are going to get an xm, this is the one!"
5,thanks,"This book contains a lot of information about fossils, a must have for any fossil enthusiast/ collector. A great guide to understanding fossils"
3,Antique,"The book has some nice pictures for fossil identification, but it's so old., it treats the mythical brontosaurus as real."
2,only for the initiates,"People new to Sonic Youth should not start here. There are patches of the brilliance long-time fans of SY expect, but this album does not shape the fragments, ideas, and melodies into finished songs, or at least not bite-size ones. That was probably not their intent, and fair enough, but the result is an album only their most dedicated fans will enjoy.The best SY albums aim both low and high, at true believers and at newcomers, whereas this album is all on the 'high' side. I wish they had evened things out a bit by spending more time perfecting the raw material here -- I think a great album of 9 or 10 more conventional songs could easily have been made from the experiments captured here."
2,matt hanks stanx,This is the best since DayDream Nation Matt Hanks I havent even heard it and i know you?? What else do you edit? Read the editorial review above..
4,More vital noise...,"Forget all the bellyachers here moaning and groaning about SY's age and how they've ""lost it."" PLEASE folks, tell me that you'd make music like this when you're reaching what you called an ""advanced"" age. Come on. This is another great recording. Despite a weak ending (basically Kim working on phonetics again . . . good for a chuckle and for the wacky guitar), NYC... is a fine document of SY's growth. I'm a long, long-time listener, and I think that this is a fine, vital addition to their recording catalog. If you are a SY fan, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by avoiding this recording based on some of the oddly less than glowing reviews I've seen posted here. I think that they've been back on track since Washing Machine, and this one's another good zap down the noisy path."
4,"Sonic Youth and electronic, good mix, but could've had more.","sonic youth is, to put it bluntly, one ov the most influential bands in my life. Their unique style ov post-punk is outstanding and will never get old. On NyC Ghost & Flowers, the experimental forsom dont' hold back. BEing forty must be tough on the ego's, but not on their muzik. Good job guys, just wish their was more on it.Ps- William S. Burroughs rocks the house."
3,"Good, but not brilliant","The latest episode from warren miller is good, but not outstanding. Missing the narration of warren, who always had a good scense of humour. Also has a section which features Jason Biggs (american pie fame) and a band (cant think of the name) which goes on a bit long."
